0,are you a football fan ?
1,"yes , i 'm . a footbal lean ."
2,did you now that the university of iowa 's visiting football teams locker room ks painted pink ?
3,"yes , i do . i think they want to intimidate the visiting teams ."
4,something like that would just make me mad and geek my team up ! you ?
5,"yes , lol . o you know about espn winning an emmy ?"
6,"yes and that superimposed line mere life a little easier , lol ! h a to believe that there are only 11 minutes of live game play ."
7,"yes , what did they do the rest of the time ?"
8,i know right ! did you know that in the 60 's top bowler made more than top all players ?
9,"i do . they now make pennies compared to professional football p , layer ."
10,"i would hope so , just goes to show how little the nfl paid back then . do you now what the highest scoring football game was ?"
11,nfl or college footbal l ?
12,think college back i nthe day when they wore those ridiculous helmets .
13,cumberland wa defeated by georgia teh . the scores were 2220 . it was in 1916 .
14,"yup and i know my hint helped , lol . did you now in austria they call football rugby ?"
15,yes . i wonder why though . do you know hey ?
16,apparently the different variations are called football codes . it 's called other things in other countries .
17,"greenellis , an rb , has never tumbled the ball in his nfl career ."
18,now that 's an achievement . do you know if he 's in teh hall of fame ?
19,"no , i do not think so other wise i would have heard ."
20,"do you watch tv at all ? it 's just a mass medium for advertising , entertainment and news ."
21,"yes , i do watch television once a day . i like veto watch national news . i 've got to uni ow . great chats !"
22,"i love to watch v , what about you ."
23,"yes , sometimes . i watch he nfl a lot . while k 'm not a fan of the redskins . i do like adrian peterson . huge 's a machine that can run and run , without fumbles ."
24,so you prefer watching nfl or attending the event ?
25,"i would prefer live it the weather 's good . the bad thing is that the possibility o injury is a bi concern , especially for qbs ."
26,ah see . most of he stadiums can be changed to indoors . . right ? i feel liek people watch the game for the qb . .
27,i'n not sure how many are outdoors only . i lke to watch managers nd coaches lke gruden . fun to see their reactions .
28,the pissed off reactions ?
29,sometimes . sometimes it 's a happy reaction . liken hen brad johnson threw a td pass to himself in a superbowl !
30,"i do n't really know how nfl came to be though . there 's so many different variations of football that exist . . . rugby , gridiron , soccer . . . just so many"
31,i think there were college people that still wanted to play . 14 of the 25 larges stadium are u . s . collie stadiums .
32,with all the prevention dont he high school level against concussions . . . just n't that the end f the game already if the parents do n't want their kids to go into football ?
33,i played in a nd my parents made the call . jog mom didn ' 5 like the idea . i didnt have my dad do the right song like snoop dogg 's son .
34,hopefully you are still throwing the ball proud on your free time ?
35,"yeah , i do with my nephew and brother once in a while . my son 's are far away unfortunately . i 'm no qb through and not lefthanded like kellan moore , the only lefthanded qb in the nfl ,"
36,are you able to run and do carries like adrian peterson ?
37,"yeah , in my dreams . did you know tat only two africanamerican qbs have won the superbowl . too bad warren moon did n't ."
38,there also seems to be more records being broken every year . . . especially whe nthe patriots have been at the superbowl so many times . . .
39,yeah . i ponder in homer simpson has a record for having 188 jobs in 400 episodes ?
40,lol . got ta love the simpsons . been o the air for so long .
41,"yeah . i still get a kick out of homer . i 'm not much for things li , e ' the shark tank . ' i hear the dial they make are phony ."
42,well a lot of people go ? shark tank just to get the name out . i think that does wonde than actually gt a deal with any of the members on shark tank .
43,"that 's true . thanks , you were an excellent chat partner !"
44,he there do you have a favorite quarterback k ? i personally do n't watch the nfl that much but i do like tom brady
45,i do n't hav ? favorite qb . i guess brady just won the sb again . how many times is that ?
46,i think it 's 6 at this point is n't it ? another quarterback i like is kellen moore . he 's the only lefthanded quarterback in th league
47,what he small number of lefties ? poes to have something to do the setting up the offend differently for a lefty ?
48,"it mighty be ? i wonder if it is him an advantage or a disadvantage being lefthanded ? what quarterbacks are geniuses though liken flex smith oh , have you heard of him"
49,alex smith ? waht team does he play for ? why is he a genius ;
50,"well heat of a lot of ap tests when he was in high school nad so he got into his university as a junior . then he got his bachelor 's degree in only 2 years and was al , most through his master 's degree before becoming the first choice in the 200 draft"
51,"impressive . got through college that fast , then studied at the graduate level while playing ball ? bright guy ."
52,yes i think so . another interesting guy is baker mayfield . he 's a quarterback and thought about becoming a professional gamer before finally getting drafted into the nfl
53,i wonde row many girls he would get as a gamer . seems like the popularity factor is better with the nfl .
54,"oh he made the right choice haha . another guy who made the right choice is paul d hubbard , he was a deaf quarterback and cheated the circular huddle that football players use today"
55,j guess i thought the huddle was something that was there from the beginning . a great qb ? i wonder how well he dud .
56,"thats hat i was wondering too . i guess maybe he could still be cout calls and different things like audibles , but you 'd think that you would have to be heard goin order tomb e a quality quarterback . but he did invent the huddle so he 's done more for football than em haha"
57,true . what do you think of u of iowas ' locked room painting tactic ?
58,"i do n't know , i 'd b curious if that would help or hurt the m off i went into a locker room and it was painted tank it would make me mad and i would play better ri think haha . what do you think ?"
59,"i would get mad too . if that tactic worked , then other teams would copy it ."
60,yep i think so . although i wonder if that 's what happened for the highest scoring football game of all time . it was 222 to 0 maybe the winning team had the other team 's locker room painted pink lol
61,that 's true . or maybe somebody golfed when they made the schedule . why would gt do that to a team ? seems wrong .
62,i know right ! it 's a hundred to zero i than the game is officially over haha . do you like the patriots at all ? i know they have a player that 's never fumble the ball which i think is awesome
63,i hope he got a bonus for that feat . that 's amazing . he must have special gloves or something . whats his name ?
64,"his name is benjarvis greenellis , and ye so must have a secret as to how he was able to pull that off haha although i would be very concerned every time i played because every game you play is a chance torn is that record haha"
65,hello how are you doing ?
66,"hello , i am taking great , you ? it you like football ?"
67,i love it . did you know that top bowlers used to make more than football stars did ?
68,"i love it also ! that is interesting , i wonder how much more fooball players make now than bowlers"
69,i would say it is a whole lot these days .
70,i are lol . did you know the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80 yard field in chicago
71,thats amazing . look what it has grown into . billions of dollars in it . millions and million of fans . its great .
72,right ! now they even have chip technology in players should pads tracking data for them
73,that really is amazing technology . did you know that benjarvis seen lewis has never fumbled in his career l
74,"i heard that before , that is a great idea ! he needs to teach a clinic to these ew era rbs on how to hold on to the ball !"
75,"well there had to be a touch of luck in , did . he played for a long time ."
76,for sur e ! i liked his name lol . do you know that lions coach matt patricia ?
77,yeah didnt he use the coach in new england
78,"yea the assistant , now coaches the lions . the guy is z rocket scientist !"
79,really . i wonder if that helps him with football at all . other tha having a really good mind .
80,i wears thinking the same thin gf do thou wathc college football at all ?
81,not really . i did hear that teh university of iowas visiting locker room is painted pink . i thought tha nwas pretty funny .
82,"that is true , i live down the street from that stadium . it is because pink has a natural calming effect on people wh see int !"
83,yeah sims he thats why . lol .
84,"for sure , maybe why they are good at home for football . it was very nice chatting with you !"
85,nice chatting with you to . have a great day .
86,"hey how are you , you think cte is real ?"
87,"i think it isreal , players end up with brain damage and that is a sad thing"
88,"for sure , i wonder how much of it i sin the player before they start too ? got to have something going on there to want to play in the nfl but yah , too many concussions is way too much and too many people getting hurt ."
89,"leah traumatic grain injuries that are also difficult todo diagnose , the symptoms take a long time to disappear ."
90,"they do , usually caused by repeated blows to the head , very difficult to diagnose ended . it 's something but no one wants to ; au attention to it it seems ."
91,did you watch that movie the one with will smith ? i thought it was revealing and the game should evolve and change for the better
92,"what was that movie called again ? i did see it , was it called concussion right ?"
93,"yeah i think thats it , self explained name when you thnk abou tit and also `` chaotic traumatic ehncephalopathy ' sounds like a serious condition ."
94,"tthat liken ' tell the truth ' is pretty iconic in my opinion , i was a good movie for sure . made me view age nfl lab it diferent . i guess it makes us thin if millions of dollars for a few years os worth all that ?"
95,"i do n't think it is , i do love the game but stink it should be safer for players . have you ever heard of gaelic football ?"
96,"i have no t , what is gaelic football ? is it like rugby ?"
97,its another variation of footballs aves ' g watched it but i guess its also really interesting .
98,very interesting . i wonder if it has more than 11 minute so five footbal alike the nfl has on average per game .
99,"that is not a lot of time , t he superbowl was really long lasted more than 3 hours"
100,"oh wow , that was such a boring super bowl though , tom brady is so good , and i 'm not even af an of his lol ."
101,"yeah , he is one of teh best qb ever to play the game . engineers end up earning more money than football players"
102,"i could see that , i 'm sure nfl players have a lot more fun in their 20s , maybe not so much their 40s and 50s though the they are so sore haha ."
103,"i have no idea about that lol , what ar our thoughts on the taken hips the players have embedded in their shoulders ."
104,"i think it 's pretty cool , the chips help them with their analytics , that 's why you see so many 3 's in the gran ow , they 've studied al 'the data and for some people it 's beneficial to blob 3s instead of jumps ."
105,oh so you are basketbal fan as well and yea hit is pretty cool all the interesting stats we can learn thanks to those chips .
106,"for sure , data i really changing the world . great talking with you though , i hope you have a grea night 2 take care !"
107,do you like sports ?
108,"i do , did you watch the superbowl last month ?"
109,i was okay
110,"but liked it , my favorite team is playing although it was a slow superbowl ; ."
111,which team ? how was their performance
112,"the patriots and heir performance was good considering they won , what do you think of brain damage and the game"
113,i like the patriots too . much like hte lannisters of football
114,"theyd ave dominated the nfl for a while so yeah , thats a valid analogy ,"
115,"ya no they have amazing players like brady . surprised he is still playing , but his performance is still solid"
116,"i agree , he is 40 ears old but still one of the best qb of he leage , wonder how much money he makes , must be w lot"
117,i hear his wife still makes more . power couple
118,she is a famous model or was a famous model to think engineers actually end up winning more fan pro football players
119,i think it is due to the high rate 04 injury leading to early retirement for many players
120,"yeah , football plates carreers seen to be short due to injuries , did you hear about the tracking chips they have ?"
121,in their shoulder pads or in the football ?
122,"both , i guess that they give all kinds of interesting stats ,"
123,i won if it is any help in reducing injuries
124,"i thinkk it could , if you meassure the impact nad then find a way to protect the players"
125,i dont ' think protective football gear hasve evolved much
126,"no , i hear they wanted to change certain rules to protect players but easier said than done ,"
127,"ina ny case , i hope less people get injured . thanks for chatting ."
128,are you a fan of nick foles and the eagles ?
129,no . i like the ne york giants .
130,i remember the day when bowlers made more money than nfl players
131,really ? that is very surprising to me . when was this ?
132,i believe it was back in the 60s .
133,i have heard that the highest scoring football game was 2220
134,yeah that was a college game . 9 believe it was against a division ii team armed cumberland
135,yep ! all the way back in 1916 .
136,this years football season has ended and now it is time for the playoffs .
137,the best team to the nfc will play the best team from the afc . his is called the superbowl .
138,do you prefer th american version of football or the english or australian versions ?
139,the american version not sure .
140,espn has added a field goal lone o their emmy winning yellow line for fist downs
141,i find it interesting there is no rule preventing women for playing in the nfl .
142,"i hope to see one in the nfl sooner , at least as a kicker"
143,that would be interesting . you may be surprised to know that a typical nfl game only has 11 minutes of gameplay .
144,"yeah , i spend hours in front of the tv only to be watching a few short minutes of the actual game"
145,it 's frustrating when yo put it like that .
146,"that is where they make all the money , the ads and constant commercials"
147,"teh nfl uses tracking chip son heir players as we , l ."
148,do york now why ?
149,jerry jones plays football .
150,he actually own the llamas cowboys . apparently he has been pushing for an 18 games season .
151,"yeah , i thought he was a player , but he is the owner . i like the commercial with the two football players who make cupcake ."
152,ha ha . troy aikman disagreed with expanding the seo ny wo games on accounts of the players health and he has many supporters with the recent research regarding brain health . i agree with try .
153,does mean pickens or injuries ?
154,injuries leading to brin damage over time . jones has encountered by saying they could shorten the preseason by two games to even it out and it would be even safer . but i disagree with that because games are more careful with their players in preseason for fear of them being injured for the actual season when it counts .
155,"id o n't know . cte is dangerous , but they ca n't diagnose it officially until someone is dead due to the way the test is performed on the brain ,"
156,true but they seem to be finding a atleast wonde degree of it in the majority of autopsies they have performed . jones asl recited more money as a reason to extend the season shih i believe is his only real motivation . i find that upsetting when he has to hav more money than he could possibly spent dat this point . it 's very greedy .
157,it 's greedy and dangerous
158,that 's true . it seem so damage their impulses control . he says the players would make more but there is no guarantee of that and i do n't think its worth their health . they are already making a staggering amount o money .
159,i think it wo n't pass . nfl is a big corporation .
160,i do n't think it will either . did you know that the average football game only has 11 minutes o actual live game play ! i know that they felt way too full of commercials and interruptions .
161,"yes m , the commercial sake al ot of money ."
162,"yes , that is a ride advertising miss . i do not like the way they are their cheerleaders . saints cheerleaders are ? t even allowed to eat in the same restaurant as players and if a player enters and they are already eating . they hav veto stop eating and lave ."
163,thatd probably due to dual harassment . there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free .
164,not sure because i also recently found out that the cheerleaders make nearly minimum wage which is ridiculous . that 's interesting . i know those here the height of entertainment t one ; dont but i wonde if they hold up now .
165,radios the interesting . jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and early by an am radio .
166,that 's pretty fascinating especially given the distance .
167,"yeah , i wonder id sapiens listen to music ."
168,i know we have sent music into space just in case .
169,i did n't know that . hopefully soothing music .
170,it 's been a while since i heard the list but i know there is some classical in there .
171,do you like the nfl ?
172,yes i do . id you know hat women can play in it as well ?
173,yes there is no rule in place that says that they can not play
174,yes and if they qualify they are good to go and play
175,yes . the game ; ay is averaged at 11 minutes anyways
176,yes and yet we are glued to the tv for hours to an end
177,true . did you know engineers make more than footballers over the lifetime ?
178,yes but they also have longer career too that helps i think
179,yes true . did you hear of that rule for the saints cheerleaders ?
180,uses the are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players
181,yes and they have to leave mid meal also if they wal in
182,yes it is so sexist and it really needs to go
183,i agree . do you watch much tv ?
184,a lot actually . i like to watch the simpsons and you ?
185,nice me too . there is an episode where bart does not appear
186,yes and he is not even mentioned in it
187,yea the how about that 70s show ?
188,yes i like it but in the uk it really flopped
189,yes after just 10 episodes because they remade it verbatim
190,yeah their bad and mistake . nice chat
191,same her ways have a good one
192,"hi , do you like nfl ?"
193,"yes , i watch a little . what about you ?"
194,i am big fan of fl . the 32 teams re great .
195,do you have a favorite fl team ?
196,"yes , the team wa new england patriots . what is your favorite team ?"
197,"that ' a cool , teh new england patriots re my favorite team , a s well !"
198,that 's great . and they win the 6 nfl championships .
199,"yes , they are great . did you watch them play in the superbowl in february ?"
200,"e e , i did . it was great ."
201,"yes , it was , but it seemed like it took three hours to play . especially , when you consider theaverage only game has only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay ."
202,"an average professional football game was 3 hours adn 12 minutes , but i you tall up the time when he blue is actually in play , hte action amounts to a more 11 minutes . sport of the discrepancy has to do with the basic rules of american football ."
203,k fee . there is alot of wasted time .
204,"maybe , it was waste of time . the new owner was robert kraft ."
205,"yes , he 's the owner . on a different subject , do you watch teelvis9on ?"
206,"yeah , i watch television . because i love watch movies , comedy shoes , adn sports ."
207,"me too ! have you ever watched , ' the simpsons ' ?"
208,i like the simpsons . it was released in 1989 .
209,did you see the episode where bart is neither seen or mentioned ?
210,i watch all 30 seasons . what about you ?
211,"oh , wow , you are a big fan ! i never remember seeing this episode , t though ."
212,i also ca n't remember that series . but i was great .
213,"yes , it was a great show ! well , it has been nice chatting with you this morning . i hope you enjoy the rest of your day ."
214,"yes , i really happy to chat with you ."
215,have a good day !
216,good morning ! do you like football ?
217,"hello there , i do enjoy football , both american and international , l , how about you ?"
218,i do ! i 'm learning a lo of jerry jones ! h ave you heard of him ?
219,"oh yeah the cowboys wonder , i thought they woulda have made z longer rut nine this years playoffs , are you a cowboys fan ?"
220,i am ! he is trying to expand to 18 games instead of the 16 they have now .
221,"yeah i could agree , if they took to put he preseason games ahah ."
222,i agree ! who wants to deal with a unexpected brain injury ?
223,exactly ! did you ever see the concussion movie with will smith ?
224,i have n't ! is it good ' did you watch it on tv ?
225,"yeah i though it was really good , and it really makes you concerned about all of the brain damage football players of al larges rake during the game ."
226,i will have to look that up . i wonder how that would affect female players in the nfl ? there i in written rule against the m .
227,"it in i read about that , i think it would be so cool if a female player did make a roster and made n impact in the leage ."
228,"one has been drafted ! with only 11 minutes of actual play , maybe they chances are ow lof her getting one ."
229,"that is very true , i do n't think most people realize just how little actual gameplay there is in games ."
230,the nfl tracking chips that are in the players uniforms have been quit handy for finding nfl lke that out !
231,"yea they sure have , i hope they are using that technology to help with player safety as well ."
232,me too ! have you ever watched the 70 's show ?
233,"yeah i sure have , i grew up in wisconsin and had a very similar teen life lol . how about you ?"
234,i just loved watching it ! was a lot of fun ! but did you know they tried to remake it in teh uk add it bombed ?
235,yeah i heard they did it verbatim and it was really bad !
236,"i guess the uk could not not relate ! i watch the simpsons , but have you seen f is for family ?"
237,"i love the simpsons , but wish they would have stopped making the how after season 912 or snl ."
238,kinda getting old is n't it ? too bad ! linda like pokemon lol me ! my kids loved that show !
239,"that is incredible how many shows they had . it was nice talking with you , i hope ou have a good day !"
240,hi there ! do you have a football team that you like ?
241,"not relaly . i 'm no into sports that much , but it 's an interesting subject to me . do you have a favorite team ?"
242,i do . i love football facts . i know former nfl'er benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled a football in his nfl career .
243,"i guess recently discoveries have been mad linking football to traumatic brain injury , obviously , but even worse , also degenerate brain disease and throne cencephalopathy ! i 'll be looking more into it , as i said , i 'm interested : ,"
244,i believe it . it is a rough sport .
245,"absolutely ! running back larry johnson is battling self destructive impulses and surely cte . it seems unfair to me , to have a sport in which the players are suffering for the rest of their lives !"
246,wow . i ha not idea of such issues . hard to believe the nfl has no rules against females playing in the league a long as they can meet eligibility requirements .
247,"shake yeh yeah ! and i was just reading about it and could out that in the 60 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ! we should all just go back to bowling ! it 's much safer : ,"
248,farms cafes indeed ! amazing that the average nfl game only a 11 minutes of live game play .
249,"yeah that is amazing ! i would think th average game play would be much longer . hm . i wonder why ! so , it 's hard to believe women could play too , but they might not be as offended if they were playing against the university of iowa who painted the visiting team locker room pink ! ha ! talk about good sportsmanship l ,"
250,no kidding ! did you know th nfl uses tracking chips to track player movement ?
251,jo i did n't ! i hope they put the chips in say the shoes or helmets versus planting them in the players bodies ! the very idea of tracking chips scares me !
252,they put hte chips in the players shoulder pads to hey can wrack every move the player makes dont he field .
253,"oh whew ! okay . that is n't sooo bad : , i wonder why the new orleans saints cheerleaders are n't allowed to eat at the same restaurant as any nfl player ! i heard that if the cheerleaders is eating at a restaurant and any player comes in , she has to leave ! that 's absurd !"
254,"sounds sexist if how ask me . an engineer 's average lifetime salary is higher than that of an nfl player . not as exciting , but interesting ,"
255,"somehting tells me that being an engineer is much safer than being an nfl player . hard to say which job would be more satisfying or more worthy o doing . considering engineers get paid more , i 'd go wit what job !"
256,i would agree . it is notable though that it is only a 17 week regular playing season for nfl teams .
257,"oh wow ! if that is per year , i 'd love to only work 4 months and 1 week a year . but i 'm sure they have to practice and do other things , like media events throughout the years . so maybe i will look into being a engineer and put my football dreams kind me . haha . kidding of coarse : ,"
258,i would too . it was really nice chatting with you today !
259,thanks ! same to yu ! i hope you have a wonderful bday !
260,goodbye e !
261,goodbye !
262,"hey , there , fellow chatter ! ho war you doing ?"
263,good thank . how are you ? it you like football ?
264,"i enjoy the sport called football , but i do not watch it much . you ?"
265,i do n't watch it a lot either . i dont really understand it thoug espn 's superimposed line does help a lot . they won an by for it .
266,"must have been a weak field of competition that year . but year , they change the color , and wi another award ."
267,haha . it 's amazing how much popularity football has gained . in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars
268,"covers had the ideal physique in the day , is my guess . people wanted to look like hem , in their polyester pants and multicolored shoes ."
269,"oh , yes ! wel , maybe if i was about for the football game where a team lost 2220 , i would be interested in football ."
270,could you make money on the same though ? and was there just 11pm minutes of action in that game ?
271,haha there would hae had to be ore right ? !
272,"the cumberland p , layer would have made more money as engineers ."
273,i find it interesting that average earnings of engineers is higher than average of fooball players
274,plus there are fewer concussions in engineering . probable engineers have better helmets . no cheerleaders though .
275,"yeah , too bad there is no respect for the cheerleaders in nfl . saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant even if they are already eating , if players waht o eat theres ."
276,i guess the cheerleaders have to wear tracking hip sun that the team knows what restaurant they 're so .
277,"haha , yeah i find it cool how technology has advanced so much in th end but i certainly hope tracking is n't necessary off the field ."
278,"that would be terrible for the players , but perhaps quite entertaining for fan , speaking of entertainment , did you ever play the nes ?"
279,i used to ! it only had 54 colors !
280,"and plenty of games . it got retired in 2003 , blew before it 's time . it should have been here for another century ."
281,"haha , true but i would have though i retired way before then !"
282,"too many people loved that little system . anyway , i enjoyed the chat !"
283,yeah . did too !
284,"hi there , hope you are having ga good afternoon . when you hear the word football , do you think of american or canadian football or rugby ?"
285,"i actually think of soccer lol ,"
286,"wel l , so do al ot of people around the world ! it 's funny that hte top bowlers in 1960s made more than the op nfl players . i 'm sure that 's not true anymore for american football or soccer !"
287,"i dont think its true anymore , pro football and soccer players make a ton of money , bowling was a popular sport back then , not as much today"
288,"ye , the games have changed over hte years . like hen espn started superimposing the yellow first down line over the field . they won an emmy for that , which is als amazing !"
289,i guessed the creation of the land is of great contribution to the game not only back then but it changed the game forever
290,"it made history for sure . speaking of history , i 've seen a few georgia tech game when i lived close by but wow , their score of 2220 made the history books as the highest ever score !"
291,"lot is a humiliating defeat , i wonder i 'the other team was blind"
292,can ' really imagine howto hat happened ! what else fo you enjoy for entertainment ? did you play nintendo back in the day ?
293,"i did , i liked it , it was primitive only 54 colors right ?"
294,"yes . hard to imagine back then , what game systems would become . tappan continued to sell them until 2003 but then they finally stopped ."
295,"i guess nobody was buying them anymore , still a great system , i used to play the mario game in that console and then nintendo 64"
296,my kids also loved ill guy the science guy too ! i never thought he looked like steve martin but apparently he won a lookalike contest !
297,"they look like twin brothers lol , that show was really fun , i liked it , was informative and interesting"
298,"ronald regan was another tv and movie star , and e even played a football player too . funny that he lost a war because he did look presidential !"
299,"that is funny ! they had . all wrong then ,"
300,"another thing i think is wrong is that the new orlean 's football team makes their cheerleaders leave a resturant if a player comes in , i get that they do n't ant them to socialize but that seem wrong on several levels ."
301,"i heard about that rule nd it makes me so angry , that is really unfair to cheerleaders having to late in teh middle of your meal just because a player comes in , makes me really angry"
302,i gues the would be better off being an engineer than cheerleaders anyway . engineers have a much higher lifetime earning than nfl players do !
303,"maybe hats because the tend to have longer carreers but i agree , football also causes bran damage and unwanted injuries"
304,"right andre wo wants that . i guess the cheerleaders could also go out for the team , since there is no ban omg female players ! then they would n't have to leave an they would n't get a injuries very often either !"
305,"i gues they could also play , they can switch roles and it will be the other way around"
306,hi how are you ? do you like sports ?
307,"hi there , i ; m good thank ou . i love sports ! how about you ?"
308,i like basketball and football . sometimes i at a chance to watch .
309,"i used to be really into basketball when i wasa growing up , i still watch my favorite team though . do you know what the highest grossing basketball movie ever was ?"
310,i enjoyed playing hen i was younger . i try to watch the finals . that highest grossing ? what ?
311,the top grossing basketball movie ever ? it was space jam . did you hear there is another place jam in the works ?
312,another one ? with lebron ? i guess that makes sense . the producers proabably waited until another superstar appeared .
313,"yeah i thinks o , i think lebron will be the star of the movie ."
314,"yeah , he just likes so much money . endorsements , salary . it is amazing ."
315,"he sure doe s , i wonder if he is making the top grossing athletes around the world ?"
316,he makes so much money . i wonder when he 'll retire . the is about 34 years old .
317,"he is , and i do n't think he will for another few years yet . do you follow the nfl at all '"
318,"i try o watch the super bowl , and maybe the playoffs ."
319,"yeah i always watch the super bowl , i mostly follow my team . the playoffs are always exiting as well ."
320,i usually root for the underdog in the superbowl . i like to seem the long shot do well .
321,"i think i usually do the same . did you there is a high school football stadium in texas that seats 18 , 000 ?"
322,in texas ? im not surprised . football i sa religion in texas .
323,"yeah they love fooball down there , especialy high school football , i think they rake it very seriously ."
324,"yeah , the fans probably wanted a bigger stadium too . anyway , great chat !"
325,"i guess it cost 6 millions to make , wow . yeah same to you it was fun chatting ."
326,hae a good night !
327,"thank you , i hope you do too !"
328,do you watch the nfl ?
329,"i am a big fan of the new , how about you ?"
330,"i am , but i do n't like that there is only 11 minutes of gameplay ."
331,it is sort of frustration that there is so little actual gameplay . sometimes it does it feel that way though .
332,"yeah , did you know that an engineer on average makes more than an nfl player ?"
333,i know a lot of players have short careers s they do n't make as much as the elite players in the league .
334,interesting . i you know that iowa 's locker rooms are painted pink for the visiting team ?
335,i did not know that . i wonder if they think that will throw off the visiting team 's performance ?
336,i think it does
337,i do n't see that playing a factor with teams they days . i would like to hear an opposing school talk about it
338,"yes . well , you are probably better off being an engineer than an nfl player ."
339,i would imagine that being an engineer comes with a lot less health risks such as brain damage !
340,a is for sure ! did you know that in the us bowlers made more than football players ?
341,"i know some of the philadelphia eagles had to have offseason jobs in th '60s . that 's how hack bednarik earned hte nickname ' concrete charlie ' , he sold concrete when hte season was over ."
342,"that 's crazy , not i can believe it . maybe they should have been bowlers ?"
343,i would be curious to know why bowlers were being paid so well then .
344,i suppose there were al ot of fans for bowlers . in 39 out of 50 states the highest paid state employee is a football or basketball coach .
345,i think it 's pretty crazy that some of these coaches get paid so much . the schools could use taht for better purposes ; .
346,"yeah , it must be a huge suck on the resources for students education ."
347,i know they bring a lot of revenue in for schools and you what the best candidates fo 'the job wb ut ther professors must feel real cheated by those salaries .
348,"i hear yah , ut i be ti they are tenure they ged paid pretty well ."
349,ar eyou a football fan ?
350,yea i watch the nfl and a little college . i 'm glad to see danny johnson made it onto the redskins despite playing at southern university
351,yes ! did you know halt he university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink ?
352,"yea , i guess iowa was trying to psych out htey visiting teams by painting the lockers pink"
353,no doubt the lol in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as thet op football stars of the day . times have sure changed since then .
354,"yea , esp won an emmy for it 's coverage of the nfl , it 's never won an emmy or its bowling coverage"
355,lo ; i loved hats superimposed line they created .
356,"yea . it 's go bad the was not tv when geogia tech beat cumberland 2220 , i 'd love to see highlights of that"
357,talk about a blowout !
358,"yea , i wonder how much live gameplay that game had since te nfl averages 11 minutes"
359,"lo , did you know that the nfl has no written rule that prevent females from playing ? maybe we 'll sew one someday . maybe a kicker ?"
360,"possibly , i wonder if a female player was on the saints if she would not be allowed to be in the same public places as the male players like the cheerleaders are"
361,is n't that an odd rule ton ave ? i do n't get it .
362,"ye , the saints rules sounds really outdated an sexist"
363,"i agree . what do you think of the tracking chips the are putting in the players shoulder pads and footballs ? they claim it 's to track the pales moves on the field and to track the velocity , etc . of hte balls ."
364,"it 's pretty interesting , i know in baseball people are making a big fan ou tofu tracking ball speed and velocity"
365,it 's crazy . i 'm wondering with the chips in football could they be programmed so that say the chip in the ball is programmed to go to the the chip in the shoulder pad ? seems kind of shady . . .
366,"i guess so but it might be cool if they pu chips in basketball , i 'd love to know how much force kareem abduljabbar 's dunk a"
367,ifr remember him ! he was famous for his hook shot and in college he dunked so much tha they banned it fir almost a decade ! it 's been fun swatting with you !
368,"yea , i wonder i jabbar ever coached , they are the highest pai employees in 39 of 50 states"
369,crazy that those college coaches are paid that u ! have a good one !
370,good morning ! do you like football ?
371,hey ther do yes i love football . i am sad that the nfl season is over .
372,i ma too . a 71 week regular season is just too short t .
373,yeah i agree especially with only 11 minutes of average gameplay per game .
374,"they definitely should make that longer . ay , i 've heard that women can play if they want to and meet the requirements . do you think they should ?"
375,i think they should if they are good enough but they should n't i they are smart . it is such a orbital game . and the dont ' make all that much because of injuries .
376,"yeah , the average lifetime earnings of a engineer are higher tha tthat of an nfl player and a mlb player ."
377,did you hear how the saints cheerleaders ca n't interact with the players ?
378,i think i have . is n't that where if a cheerleader is in a restaurant and a player comes in she has to leave ?
379,yeah exactly . the nfl even track players movements using tracking chips !
380,you mean on the field right ?
381,yes on the field ! the put it in their shoulder pads and also the footballs itself !
382,do ! i knew a little about the football bur i had no idea they had chips on the players too .
383,yeah no wonder they can get such good accurate stats !
384,you know you 're right ! it does make sense when you think about it . i wonder if they 'll ever use those chips liken asia does theur cars and be able to tell if players make touchdowns and first downs .
385,good question . i also really liken he yellow is down marker when watching games on tv . espn won an emmy for that .
386,i like that too . it makes the lame more intense and exciting when you see how far a team has to go to make the firs thrown .
387,agreed . i wonder if the nba uses chips to track stats too ? there is even a bball court on top of the usa supreme court building .
388,"hmm , i never thought about that . if they do n't , they should . that bball court you 're talking about by the way is called the highest court in the land ."
389,oh very cool . wonder if anyone famous hazy played there ? kareem bulb jabbar used to have such a dominant dunk that it got banned on college !
390,in got banned ? he must have been overpowering teams and winning all the time !
391,hello !
392,"helo , do you have good knowledge about football players ?"
393,i am not a huge fan of football but i like basketball . . . .
394,same ! i like basketball . i am a big fan ot the golden state warriors . how about you ?
395,"cool , i am a big fan of phoenix suns . . . my team !"
396,nice ! have you been to a game ?
397,"yes , not too many but a few . how about you ?"
398,a few ws well . i always go to the stadium early to receive bobbleheads of the basketball payers .
399,"that 's awesome , i have a couple of those too but bought them from wa friend ."
400,"awww man , i hope they are worth the price . reading from the factual section e , i agree that space jam is the highestgrossing basketball movie . have you watched it ?"
401,i think i have but it has been a long time lol . . . . i too think it is interesting that the us supreme court building has a basketball court on the top floor how cool is that !
402,that is cool . i guess they need some exercise after a chord day 's work .
403,true ! basketball is definitely good exercise lol
404,do you play ?
405,"i did back in school but not anymore . i play softball on al league though and its pretty fun , how about you do you play any sports ?"
406,"it 's been a while since i played a sport . i used to play basketball , but now it 's al about tennis and badmitnon . of course in this kind of weather is a no no ."
407,"yea , i live in a warm climate so we play sports more in cooler weather when its 70s and 80s outside ."
408,"for sure , i bet . i am waiting until the sun comes up ."
409,have you ever played football at all or revert har a team you like in the nfl l ?
410,"well , in middle school , but hot a fan . i only like the 49ers . it is because of mu relatives ."
411,"oh , yeah . . . i only watch sometimes because of friended lol"
412,it was nice talking to you . happy new year .
413,happy new year ! ! ! bye !
414,how is it going ? do you like football ?
415,"hello ! i am . i prefer college , but i am pumped for the playoffs this weekend !"
416,awesome ! i do n't keep up with football much . so is in the playoffs ?
417,"there are four teams from the national ans america fooball conferences . the nfl as la rams , cowboys , eagle s , and saints . the afc has kc , la chargers l ne , and indiamapolis ."
418,"oh ok , i only know some of those . its kind crazy to think the nfl actual gameplay is only like 11 min when it usually last about 34 hours !"
419,"that is crazy ! to think they spend all that money , going as far a stacking almost every move of a player through specially designed chips for such a relative short time of actual game play ."
420,"i heard about that too , technology has improved so many things , like also when you are matching football they can draw on the screens and show different plays and when the line is they highlight it . they also have amazing playback or forward drop ; lays !"
421,great point . how many of us are inducted to madden for breaking down football like that ?
422,"probably millions lol football has some weird customs , what is with a deal painting the opposing teams locker room pink ?"
423,"ah , i know that team all too well . that 's iowa who is my team 's rival as we are neighboring states ."
424,oh i see . how you know what the tactic or custom is ? why do they aint it pink ?
425,"i am pretty sure it was hayden fry , who hte old tv show ' coach ' was loosely based on , . i think it sas that te pink would motivate the opposition or make them lose their edges ."
426,"ah i see , maybe to soften them up i guess . that 's pretty smart , unless hey knew about it already . did you kno wthe is a football player tha never fumbled in his whole career ? why isn ; t this guy more sought tour after lol that sounds incredible l ."
427,"wow . maybe he just is n't as explosive as others , but it 's pretty impressive ."
428,i know right ! i believe he played for the patriots .
429,"do you lke any other sports , like basketball ?"
430,"kinda the see , i do not follow it much . i watch the warriors sometimes though , how about you ?"
431,"i watch a little . i will admit that the warriors re not my favorite team . i guess it 's because they are so good , but i have to remember that they really built that team from scratch and then added amazing players around what they drafted l"
432,"yeah , true . i find it funny that the inventor of basketball is the only losing couch in kansas university history lol"
433,"i wonder how much he got paid fo that ? in the vast majority of states today , the college basketball or football coach is the highest paid employee of the state ."
434,"hmmm good question . i hope he gets some sort of royalties lol this sport has blown up , it is so popular and generates so much money ! anyways its been good talking to you !"
435,i love the nfl i cant wait for the season to start back up ! 17 weeks is not enough ! do you like football ?
436,i have a passing knowledge
437,thats greet ! do you watch football or just keep up with it in general ?
438,mainly watching it time to time
439,cool ! i really like ow hitech they are getting adding ichiro chips into players pads send the football or . it makes the game fun !
440,they sure get a lot of data . i wonder what they use it for
441,ive heard football peed when through and other stuff . funny that the biggest thing for them as th addition of the yellow first down line . won team an emmy !
442,that was bye spun right ?
443,yeah ! really cool tha something so simple had such a huge impact ! nothing like inch mickey when they highlighted the puck .
444,"i mean considering there is only a dozen or so minutes of real gameplay , any help understanding what is going on is a huge plus"
445,true 2 they dont even play that much ! if they are only playing for 11 minutes they figure out a way to make games more fun . you know . . make a game with some huge scars like 200 or soothing .
446,the winner were just that good and the losers just that bad i guess
447,i bet youre right . you really need a poor team to go nothing against a team that scores 222 . i dont even know who cumberland is . .
448,i mean the winners must have had talent like tom brady o 'green ellis
449,i always that greenellis was great . he wa amazing and i think never fumbled the ball . ever !
450,indeed . that is an impressive feat
451,yeah it is ! i dont think he even got paid that well . nothing lionel even bell nad his 1 6million a year
452,well at least these players are much better paid now team in the 1960s when even bowlers made more
453,ai n't that the truth ! for how physical the get is they should be getting paid a lot .
454,it is a dangerous contact s ; port after all . it is probably due to forced early retirement taht the average football player 's lifetime mannings is less than the of engineers
455,yes it is . have a great day !
456,to you1 s well .
457,are you a fan of the nfl ?
458,nfl ? the national football league ? i dont really know it will . you ?
459,"yea that is , do you know any of the 32 teams ?"
460,"yeah , i guess i have heard some names . the patriots is one that i hear a lot"
461,"yea they keep winning super bowls 2nd have the greatest quarterback of all time , tomb read . you do n't watch much tv l , do you watch college football much ?"
462,"no , i dont . i guess the ga , e is more fun at the college level . the kid probably enjoy paying the game ."
463,"yea , my favorite team is iowa , they paint their visiting locker room pink"
464,"i wonder if that has any effect all . if so , i would expect overdone to do it ."
465,"i wonder also , i would have to check their home record o see a trend . are you a basketball fan since you do n't watch much football ?"
466,"i like baseball , but i usually watch around the playoffs . i like golden state . you ?"
467,"me too , i liek the bulls , at golden state is fun to watch . do you know who james naismith was ?"
468,he was the guy who invented the port wh e was canadian i believe .
469,"he was the worst coach in , kansas history , you think he could have rigged te game in his favor"
470,he might ahve had bad players too . maybe he just didnt get the strategy . oh well . i think he has an award named after him .
471,"for sure , i heard hat also . so you ever catch anything on espn ?"
472,"no , though it guess it is insanely popular . sports all the time would be a big hit in the us ."
473,they won an emmy for their yellow line on tv
474,an say ? i dont know that award . the yellow line ?
475,"sorry they won an emmy , lol ! that is a big thing for something so small"
476,"oh , an emmy . yeah , the tv award . a yellow line ? hm . a weak year for awards . anyway , great chat !"
477,"you took , it was so nice chatting with you !"
478,"hello , do you like football ?"
479,"i do like football sometimes , not all the time , but sometimes . you ?"
480,"i watch a few games a year , but i do not keep up with it at all ."
481,"i try to watch the playoffs , maybe the superbowl ."
482,thats cool . did you know the nfl has no written rule against female players ?
483,"i have heard that , but i do n't think that women can quality . it 's a tough game"
484,"yeah , just depends on the woman . i hear the nfl uses tracking chips on the players and football ."
485,"i hold like to see a woman that coudl o that . i have no problem with that l i the can play , let her in . put the tracking chips on her ."
486,the average the play of w football game is 11 min ! it takes like 3 hours usually to see the whole event lo .
487,"those players spend a lot of time standing around and waiting . i figured that 11 minutes was a bit sort , but now that i think about it , it sounds right ."
488,"lol yeah i know right ! so many time outs , foul s , huddles , etc ."
489,"yes , basketbal list a sporty half lows a lot more ."
490,"i agree , a lot of consistent action ."
491,basketbal ; l was invented by a canadian . a canadian
492,lol cool . i hear the inventor of basketball is the only losing coach in the university of kansas history . ironic c .
493,"he really could not coach . i guess he knew ow to create game , not play them ."
494,"yeah , thats unfortunate . i hope he gets royalties o something , his game has blown up ! it generates so much money !"
495,"yes , it has . the college coaches make so much . it seems like a distortion of the purpose f college ."
496,yeah 39 out of 50 states is highest paid employee is the college basketball or football coach .
497,"i wonder where this all going to lead . soon the degreegrantinga expect of college will become optional extra . anyway , great hat !"
498,great speaking with you .
499,hi do you follow football ?
500,"i am a fan yeah , do you have a favorite team ? 3 2 teams 2 division 1 winner"
501,my favorite team is the buffalo bills . lol th university of iowa painted theirs visitors locker room pink . i think the bills might have stepped in there once . lol
502,how did they do past season ? and that is funny lol a pink locker room fo 'the visiting team
503,hte bills did n't do well . they rarely do well . have n't been good in the jim kelly days . in the 10 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars did back then . that 's sure chatted now .
504,"twice as much woah , that is impressive , that a lot of money , things have changed a lot for players over the years"
505,hes ! former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the ball i his nfl career . impressive !
506,"that is impressive , did you hear about coach matt patricia ?"
507,i have n't heard of him . waht did he do ?
508,"he is a rocket scientist sand also a coach , he must be a really smart man ."
509,i bet ! i 'll have o loop him p . espn won an emmy for creating the yellow superimposed first down line on tv .
510,"i guess the yellow line is a big contribution to the game , also the tracking chips , t hose seem great also ."
511,"yes i agree ! the nfl has no written rule against female p , layer . wonder if any gave ever tried out ?"
512,there 's no written rule against female players really ? i guess we wont see them play in the league as its a physical game
513,i know . maybe as a kicker maybe . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
514,"only 11 minutes ? that seem really far , so since the re introduction of the nfl in 999 the qb with most ins is be roethlisberger"
515,that must be in the cleveland browns stadium ?
516,"i ithink h player for the steelers , he must be a hall of famer ."
517,he is their current qb . the highes score ever for a football lame was when georgia tech deaf cumberland 2220 . it 's been un chatting !
518,"oh i see , didnt know he still played and that is a humiliating loss , hope you have a nice day , its been fun chatting bye ."
519,have a good day !
520,"hi , how are you ?"
521,"i a swell , ow are you ?"
522,i am well . do you know anything about virginia football ?
523,i know that virginia football yeas genre trying to fix it 's program with a new athletic director . they have not been doing well in past seasons .
524,they have not . their basketball program has been better under tony bennett .
525,is tony bennett new to the basketball program ?
526,"no , he 's been there for af ew years . got them up to a top 5 rank . slow and boring o which though ."
527,i am hoping that the football team will do better this year . they only won 6 games this year .
528,yesh . i think they would be better . theyve got a good recruiting base there .
529,tey 're trying to get the recruitment even better . they are also adding a football operations center to draw even more attention .
530,nice . clemson just added something like that and it was a recording studio in there for their players !
531,that reminds me that the supreme court building has a basketball court on the top floor .
532,that 's a strange place for it . i wonder how often phd notorious rbg plays . . .
533,chew ill ge thinking banned like kareem abduljabbar
534,i othe get those two confused . . . the highest paid coach in many states is their basketball or football coach .
535,an amusing contrast to the last that the players are no paid anything
536,yeah . really sad for them . i do n't feel like free education is enough for many of these player s .
537,through free schooling in exchange for about 11 minutes of gameplay sumo like a good deal .
538,"when put like that , yes that seems like a great deal !"
539,hopefully the whole department can work together and improve stings for both he players nd te staff
540,yeah . nice chatting with you !
541,did you know steve spurred coach the redskins ?
542,lol . . . yeah ! i still remember that scene where he di duck lips and thet v station slowed it down .
543,"i know , its hard to find characters as known and famous as steve lol , he sure is a strange thing ."
544,ya . . . a heisman trophy winner and also coached at florida state .
545,in what year did h win the heisman trophy ? thats new to em .
546,it ws 1966 at university of florida
547,"oh i see , it was a long time ago , i heard he also led a team called the tampa bay bandit ."
548,"yeah , he 's been around quite a bit . that 's just crazy though that the redskins do n't even have him listed on their web site when listing past coaches ."
549,"they dont ? i wonder if thats because of an internal problem m , he was one of the highest paid coaches in nfl while on the team"
550,"i am sure because they are embarrassed . . . but come on , you hired him !"
551,"he has 12 victories in 32 games so maybe thats why he got fired , i think the team had high hopes on him ."
552,i am sure htey did . . . that 's just disrespectful and childish . . . there are a lot worse coaches out there !
553,"there sure are , speaking of lack of respect the lockers for the visiting team o 'the university of iowa are painted all link"
554,"omg . . . that 's just mean ! ! ! so about the disrespect the ne orleans saints cheerleaders 04 7 when a player come into a restaurant , even if the cheerleader was there before the player the cheerleader has to leave !"
555,"that is really rude and sexist , i mean why do htey have to leave if they dont want players mixing with cheerleader why dont make it both ways ."
556,exactly ! ! ! it 's the nfl playing god ! ! ! geez ! ! !

572,"they are good , t hey are my hometown team and alma mater ! they paint their locker rooms pink for the opponents"

581,"its called the highest court on land , cop lame and yea that would be funny lol"
582,"nice , that is a cool place , i wonder if it actually gets used . it was so nice chatting with you , enjoy your day !"
583,hey did you know in the 60 's the top bowlers made 2 a much as teh top football players ?
584,"hello those , no way i did n't know that . that is pretty crazy to think how much thas changed since then ."
585,"ya i do n't even know how much bowlers make now , probably only the top ones make decent money now"
586,yeah i would say you are right . did you know tha taht is school football stadium in texas cos the million to build ;
587,"no thats crazy , espeically for high school with is not serious and i 'd imagine doesn ' generate close to taht much even , i wonder why thay spent so much"
588,"yeah that is a crazy mount of moneys or high school football . i guess it seats 18 , 00 0 ! !"
589,"too , i do n't know i do n't personally like football that much do you ? this says the average nfl game only has 11 minutes o five gameplay hide does n't surprise me haha"
590,holy cow that is very little . i guess you do n't notice so much when rewatching it on tv .
591,"no but it makes sense , there ? s lots of them positioning nd replays and referee scaling stuff , like the actual action is only 11 minutes thats very wild the me but it makes sense"
592,yeah it does when you think about it . do you know what year was the first nfl playoff game ?
593,i do n't was it in the early 1900 's ?
594,yeah it was in 1932 on an 80 yard dirt field in chicago . i bet that was pretty rough being tackled on .
595,"ooooo ya that sounds like it would hurt , i saw on youtube the first tema to have helmets with symbol son them werent he rams , one teammate just painted the circular horns on his helmet one day"
596,"that is awesome , old football stories are pretty interestin . are you a basketball fan as well ?"
597,"not som ca but i do watch gamer from time to time . i 'm not of a tennis can , i like that there is no team and it is 100 percent on one person not win or lose"
598,"yeah i like them both , m i am a sports fan in general . i always said i would get into hockey if i had a local team to cheer for ."
599,"oh what area do you live in ? i 'm in detroit so most people ar red wings fans , but il ike pittsburgh cuz thats where a lot of my family is from"
600,i am from wisconsin and use do n't have a team in this state .
601,"ah that is true , ya you 'd think bing so far north that they would obviously have a tea m , and being close to canada haha"
602,yeah that is true . at least we have a pro nfl team .
603,"what i did n't know is the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl play for mlb player , o average"
604,"how i would never have guessed that , maybe because they are working more years . it was nice talking with you today ."
605,hi ho ware you today ?
606,"i 'm great , it 's really inspiring to hear about how steve spurred played so hard in his day and earned the reputation to game the highest paying coaching position in history ."
607,"yeah , and did you know that he actually coached the reasons for two seasons ?"
608,"yes that 's exactly the position i am referring to , they paid him almost 25 million for a five year contract . i wonder why he only patched two seasons ."
609,"yeah really , ahha . in the 1960 's top bowlers made as much a stop football stars"
610,"wow , i could have done that since bowling is a lot easier than football ! but apparently nfl players really do n't make as much as other careers , like engineers ."
611,really ? should age been an engineer .
612,"gyess seriously but some of us lack math skills . . sounds like it 's tough working in athletics , ca not belief new orleans saints cheerleaders are n't even allowed to eat at the same restaurant as an nfl player ?"
613,i a n't believe that . i wonder why ? how about the highest score ever in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 .
614,theyd re southern so maybe they just have a very prime and proper reputation to protect a that was crazy . it makes me wonder if they rigged it ! it reminds me of great patsy talking about the world series being rigged around the same year .
615,yeah ! i was suprised to read that a former rb patriots benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball in his entire football career . that 's amazing !
616,"yeah seriously , we ' e come a long way since then considering that we know in track players with chips o know everything about theirs peed , velocity , rotation and more ."
617,true . did you now the university of iowa painted the visiting team 's locker room pick . they got a pretty good sense of humor .
618,oh i hope they were good sports about it .
619,"i totally meant pink . glad you got that . yeah , i 'm sure they were ."
620,wow i didnt eve read but as anything but pink have . i could imagine fooball can get pretty aggressive an competitive we so much income is involved .
621,oh yeah ! it 's pretty cool that there are so many variations of football . they are known as football codes .
622,"i can never get in to football , you only ever get to see like eleven minutes of actual live gameplay per game !"
623,that 's true . he rest is commercials . although i do love teh new superbowl commercials . hose are fun .
624,i also enjoy watching the superbowl commercials . i ponder if watching superbowl commercials was aways so possible even back in teh salary day sin the 70s
625,i wonder too . i 'll have to look it up . i just found out that espn created the yellow line representing the first one line for football .
626,ia was saw that on tv but have before thought bout where that came from . didd you hear they wo n't award for that ?
627,"yeah , that won an emmy . pretyy awesome . i wonder who came up with it ? it had to start with one person ."
628,probably sod network graphic designer guy or team i guess .
629,"happy holidays , nice talking to you ."
630,do you like football ?
631,"i 'm a fan of all sports , but football happens to be one of my favorites and i follow the nfl closely . you ?"
632,i do n't really watch it that much . i did watch the super bowl which is the first sunday in february .
633,"o h , did you hear anything about a 's been going with le'veon bell this past season ?"
634,i heard eh is back in pittsburgh .
635,"he held out thai year , hoping to get a big contract from pittsburgh or become a free agent next year . you would n't believe ow muh he obey he cost himself ."
636,"455 , 000 a week . is that really true ? wow !"
637,"yah that 's years and years of salary for me lol . he will likely et a huge contract this summer , he 's one of the best running backs in footbal ."
638,"right , but i guess since nfl players do n't play for so many years , the average lifetime earnings of engineers are higher ."
639,"yeah , you have to figure we mostly hear about the top players who make a ton , but the average guys do n't make as much as say le'veon bet . i think the average career is like w few years in the nfl ."
640,he made 12 . 1 million in 2017 but had no tween paid anything this season .
641,right . did you know they track player and football movement now through chips ?
642,"yeah , lots of cool technology in football these days ? . espn got an emmy for the superimpose yellow line ."
643,i ca n't imagine watching football without that yellow line . do you like basketball better than football ?
644,i do find basketball more interesting . i find it funny that the inventor of basketball is the only losing coach in the university of kansas 's history .
645,haha hat is funny . must have been a while ago . do yu have a favorite team or player ?
646,i guess the golden state warriors since ia m from that area . how about you ?
647,i 'm a nicks fan . not a lot of good things to say bout them these days . they have a tough time putting 5 decent guys on the court .
648,i like seeing basketball players slam dunk ;
649,"me too , it was banned periodically rom college basketball"
650,that was because of wares abdul jabbar right ? pretty funny !
651,hi do you like basketball ? did you know the inventor of basketball is the only losing coach in the university of kansas ? history ?
652,i do follow basketball closely from time to time and no i did n't know that bout inventor of basketball .
653,"i do n't know a lot about the sport but i do know about a few places , like kareem abduljabbar . his dunk shot ot baned from college basketball ."
654,wow ! ! do you know the length of this particular hen ?
655,apparently they banned 'the dunk for over a decade .
656,thanks i did n't know this . how many points is a field goal worth in basketball ?
657,i just learned a field goal is worth two points but i thought field goal were in football not basketball .
658,thanks . how much is it worth bind the three point line ?
659,i think it is worth the and that is why it has the name three point line . but i know so little of the sport . i know that basketball games cant ' tie and must play overtime for a winner .
660,does tiem stop when someone gets fooled in basketbal l ?
661,"yes . i just learned after a foul , time played stops and the player would against or designated duo shoot a technical foul is given one or more onepoint free throws ."
662,thank you som ca . you mentioned earlier about teh inventor of basketball do you know by any chance his name ?
663,"yes . his name is james naismith . he was a college ecoahd . in 39 out of 50 states , the highest paid state employee is either the college football or basketball coach ."
664,think . i did n't know anything about this . very interesting . do you kow howe any players are in each team that play basketball ?
665,i know when the game is active there are five players each on the court . i am not sure how many or on the bench .
666,take . i heard that the new zealand basketball team have a nickname do you know hat they are called ?
667,i just learned they are nicknamed the ' the blacks . ' i think they child have come up with a more appropriate name .
668,me too ! ! they could of come with a pun better name than that .
669,"here 's a fun fact , the us supreme court building has a basketball court on the op floor and it is known as ' the highest court in the and '"
670,i 'm very surprised with their fact . thanks for chatting with mr today . i hope you have a nice evening ! ! ! b ye
671,thanks for chatting as well . k learned a lot of new and fun information np goodbye .
672,"hi , how are doing this fine evening ?"
673,"good . enjoying some of the extra time i have now that teh nfl season is over . the season runs for 17 weeks , s it lasts a few months"
674,quite true . i did n't get a chance to watch the sb . i 'm surprised that it average nfl game has only 11 minutes of action . i though tit would be more .
675,i guess all the stops adn talks about stats make it seem longer . i wonder ow they kept track of all the stats before they embedded tie ball and shoulder pads with chips to measure
676,"i think the chips for tracking are good . i bet it helps with strategy , but also maybe with profiling injuries ."
677,it 's possible see did you know women an play in the nfl if they meet eligibility requirements ? i 'm surprised y that .
678,"i guess fo some positions , it would york . kicker . punter . place holder ."
679,"maybe . there 's still a risk , but at least the playoffs are single elimination rather than best out of 4 pike the mlb"
680,"i think it would create controversy , which the league likes because it attracts viewers . then again , would you rather have your daughter be a nfl player , or an engineer ?"
681,"engineering is a hard field for women too due to discrimination , but over a lifetime , they ' l make more money on average than football players ."
682,"three , and the need al the engineers we can get ."
683,whereas there are many men who will all football . it 's interesting how teh nfl is divided into the nfc and afc
684,"i think historically there more a couple of leagues brought together in the 60s , when top bowlers made twice as much aa top football stars"
685,that 's definitely changed with hoe televised football has become . espn knew what they were doing by creating the superimposed line for the first down
686,that line seems sp basic ! how did they win an award for it ?
687,i guess no one had thought of how important it would be for those viewing on television . it 's funny how simple things can make a big difference . i wonder what rb benjarvus greenellis ' secret was to never having a cable inch is career
688,he had s ; special gloves ? i dunno . a great feat . i hope he got a bonus .
689,still not as unbelievable s the georgia tech game against cumberland . 2220 is a tough break for the loser
690,"i hope that t part in their third string . that 's a horrible score . what was the spread , i wonder ."
691,who know . i wonder how many of those players went on to play in the nfl
692,"i do n't think the nfl existed at the time . college ball was the big thing . anyways , great chat !"
693,it 's very possible !
694,do you liked to watch football ?
695,love football . . i like the titans .
696,"i do n't really like footbal , maybe it 's because each has game only has 11 minute and live gameplay"
697,there is a lot of action in those 11 minutes .
698,"even so , i get bored in between . it 's interesting how much nfl has gained in popularity . the top bowlers made twice much as top football stars in the 60s ."
699,"i think engineers make , ore than football players ."
700,"yes , over a lifetime it seems they have more . but i do n't think that accounts for sponsorships some nfl players get"
701,some are smart business men . . how many teams are in the nfl ?
702,as far as i know there are 325 teams .
703,super bowl is coming soon ! ! first sunday in february .
704,i might get together with sole friends for that . wh are you rooting for ?
705,"i wish the titans here going but they arent ' so we shall see ! ! i 'm excited for lamar jack , son youngest rookie to make it to the playoffs ."
706,it 's interesting how much technology there is in football these days to make sure things are accurate
707,espn won a emmy fo using the yellow line .
708,and now there are tracking ships in boulder pads and footballs to track various things
709,that 's amazing . i you ahve a favorite team ?
710,i do not . perhaps i woul say the 49ers imply because i 'm from ther .
711,the 49ers had a few good games this year .
712,i have n't really been following .
713,you like watching the halftime shows ?
714,"i think they are exciting , yes ."
715,did you know the nfl has no written rule against meal lawyer ?
716,i did ! i wish more women met the eligibility requirements so we could see then in action .
717,"well , there wo n't be much action . an nfl game actually only has 11 minutes of live gameplay !"
718,the real game play to watch is from the chips in their shoulder pads showing their moves .
719,"yeah , apparently they put chips in their shoulder pads !"
720,do you like basketball ? i like the smaller team of 5 as opposed to the larger football teams .
721,i watch it sometimes . they banned the dunk for awhile because kareem .
722,what did kareem do ? did he play for kansas where james naismith was a losing coach ?
723,a was just a really good player that could slam dunk .
724,he should have gone into coaching . some of the highest state paid employees are coaches .
725,i believe it . did you know espn won an emmy for the firs down marker ?
726,i i not ! pretty cool ! almost as cool as playing basketball at he us supreme court on the top floor !
727,"interesting , they have a court up there ?"
728,they do ! i would love to play and try info over lime by tying the game to get some extra time up there .
729,well in teh 1960s top bowlers made twice s much as footbal stars .
730,that 's amazing since bowling is not for popular . i love o bowl even though i am not very good .
731,"i bowl in a league , b ut i do n't make any where near a football star ."
732,", you know the dimensions of a bowling 'll ? i believe they are bigger than a basketball at 9 . 4 inches in diameter ."
733,id o n't know . but i think some are digger than others depending knw tight .
734,"it woul , d be an interesting sight tos lee a bowling bowl go through a basketbal loop of 18 inches in diameter ."
735,that would be hilarious .
736,hey there you a football fan ? i love the american version but not so much the rugby or australian rules variation .
737,i love football ! did you know that the nfl has no written rule against female players ? a woman woud be allowed just as long as she met the requirements .
738,i would have to see that ! she probably would n't mind playing at the university of iowa with the pink locker room !
739,"agreed . it 'll happen eventually , especially now tha there are fema refs . i wonder if they 'd be allowed to eat in the same restaurants . . saints cheerleaders are n't allowed to eat in a restaurant a player is in and if the players comes in while the cheerleader if eating , she has to leave ."
740,true . that is an odd rule . not sure if i agree . the nfl also uses tracking chips in the players shoulder pads to track movement .
741,very interesting ! adn an average nfl game has only 11 mins of live gameplay .
742,wow . too much time or ads lol . engineers even make more lifetime earnings han most nfl players !
743,"i believe hat . are you a fan of basketball ? hte inventor of basketball , james naismith , is the only losing coach in the history of the university of kansas . pretty ironic ."
744,yes i love bball ! very ironic . i wonder who th best coach in kansas history is . the new zealand basketball team is nicknamed the all blacks !
745,a little inappropriate but i fit does n't bother them then ok ! haha did you know the the us supreme court building has a bball court on the top floor and it 's called ' the highest court in the land ? '
746,"i would love to play in he highest court in the land . college coaches get paid so much , they are the highest paid state employees in 39 out of 50 states ."
747,"met 's . that 's pretty wild , i would have thought it would be football coaches or players woudl eb top paid . in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top footbal players !"
748,"me too . that ios a funny fact , never would have expected that . i love watching football on tv . i remember watching greenellis because he never fumlbexd the ball ."
749,oh yeah the played ron the pats . taht 's awesome . i l ; on watching football too . i 'm already looking forward to next season . the highest score ever in a football game wa 2220 . i 'd call that a shut out .
750,"yeah no doubt . that happened fact , in 1916 i do n't think that wold ever happen currently ."
751,"definitely not in the nfl with only 11 minutes of game play . also , i did n't know this until recently , but the nfl also uses chips inside the footballs to track the velocity , speed , and location ."
752,that explains how they get such accurate stats and stuff . they also put the chips in the shoulder pads to track player movement .
753,"well with it being the highest professional level of american football , i know the nfl definitely invests . the best technology ."
754,yes you said it right . with only 71 regular season games they have go pack j tall in ! well i really enjoyed conversing wit hyou !
755,"yes , definitely a good conversation ! have a great day or night !"
756,unfortunately no football to watch this weekend because the superbowl already happened ! bye now !
757,"hi , do you like football ? by football i mean nfl football ."
758,"i love watching both nfl wand college , how about you ?"
759,i mostly just watch nfl but i do watch some college too . now is the hardest time of the year . super bowl over . it 's a long way nunti september . .
760,"right , at least they have that new league , but i don ' watch i ? do you have favorite teams ;"
761,me either . i dont ' really have a a i 'm a die jazz fan of dance there is no nfl team where i live . did you know the nfl puts chips inside the footballs to measure velocity and rotation ?
762,"there is no nfl team where i live either , i like the iowa hawkeyes though for college . i never knew about the chips that is interesting ."
763,"they are even inside players shoulder pads too ! i think that is to measure how nerd of a hit they are trying , or giving ."
764,"wow , i wonder if they are related by the engineers who make more money n their lifetime than nfl players"
765,probably ! the time it would take to design tha tc also making them small enought o they are noticed by the players . i think the average nfl salary is low because heir careers are so short and unlike otter sports they all have non guaranteed contracts .
766,"for sure , you only hear of the star players making hte big bucks . have you ever heard the worst score in college football ever ?"
767,"i did , but i dont recall . i remember it happened a long time ago an was super embarrassing . i take it you know ?"
768,"it was 2220 in 1916 , g corgi tech vs cumberland . i would have quit after that game lol"
769,wow ! i was thinking maybe 100 point spread ? . they could hav eat least shown mercy . i guess back then teams were a lot more ruthless . too ba espn was n't around then i 'd love to watch the highlight sand se the faces of the cumberland players l
770,right or just left hte field to never play again lol . i would hope a mercy rule was created after thet gmail
771,or at least some kind o gentleman 's agreement where you stop using to score more points which is probably what would happen now . it was a different time heck then .
772,"do sure , a lot different back then . nowadays they are pink locker rooms for college ol"
773,"i saw that , although i do n't think that would really bother the visiting tesla touch . they are so focused on the game ."
774,actually the pink messes with them . pink is a calming color and relates them extra
775,i guess that makes sense . did you know espn created the superimposed yellow line for 1st owns before any other broadcast network ? they won an emmy for it !
776,wow ! i never knew that ! i used to think i was area growing up lol . it was so nice hitting wath you !
777,have a great night !
778,thanks you as well !
779,i read a lot of sports illustrated . im a big fan of the nfl
780,"interesting . i 'm a space junkie , and i 'm all of te internet speed that the international space station has ."
781,i heard its faster than ours here in the us . is that true ?
782,"it sure is . it 's weird that there are more automated software programs on the internet , that humans ."
783,maybe its trying to stop people from clicking links on the internet . it can be an addiction
784,"maybe , as egosurfing is very read . i 've never looked myself up , though ."
785,do you you read the full terms when buying a product online ? only 7 percent of people do
786,i do not . are you a snoop dogg fan ? he wrote a song for his son 's football team . how cool is that ?
787,that is pretty cool . i wonder if the song is longer than that hte length of live game play in the nfl which hs only 11 mins
788,i do n't know . it 's amazing that college football team have 14 of the ; largest stadiums in th world . i would have thought those would belong to nfl teams .
789,they even have a pink visitors locker room located at iowa !
790,"that 's funny . surprisingly , the coaches of the military football teams , are the highest ; aid employees at the department of defense . seems a little silly that they are worth more than the people who put their lives on the line to keep us safe ."
791,n many states coaches are also the highest paid person
792,"that 's insane . so is the stadium in tx that cost 60 , illion . . . for a highschool team ."
793,was that all paid my trades ? you have to wonder
794,"who knows . it ' a little disgusting to thin tthat they speed so much money on a tracking chip that monitors players every move , ah dale the stats of a football , yet , . . . we do n't have those capabilities on cars ."
795,maybe its because the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than that of a player . got to learn how to keep them healthy
796,"genre is a rocket scientist who coaches in the nfl . matt patricia , ever heard of him ?"
797,i ahve ! he coached 'the lions . thats a crazy career path for a person
798,"his school 's fight song has six digits of pi in it m , that woul day a fun school to attend ."
799,thats funny
800,"thank you for chatting with a , have a wonderful day ."
801,you as well thanks
802,good morning .
803,good morning . do you follow football ?
804,"off and on . i do watch it occasionally , both college and the nfl ."
805,"i first learned football in his school juan sitting in the stands . i was n't there , originally , for it , but i got to learn the rules and such . it sure helped me out torn math by 7s !"
806,"that is an interesting skill to pick up by watching football . for how long of a game it is , it iss surprising that htey average game only has a minutes of live play tiem ."
807,"i wonder how that compares to baseball , which is often regarded days a boring , nation sport . soccer and hockey and continuous nation , by comparison . i 'll be the highestscoring game ever , a 2220 you , had more than 11 minutes . it would certainly take me more than 11 minutes to run 222 football fields ."
808,that is ah huge score for 1 footballs am . i woudl have likes to see that . too bad that was in 1916
809,"i think it would have gotten boring after they reached 60 points , then exciting again after 100 , when he novelty o fit is just ' how high can they go ' and ' will the other team score at all ? ' i'n much more interested in the strategy behind the game . only real players cant ive you that insight , like paul zimmerman , who wrote for sports illustrated ."
810,"yeah , i know he wash highly respected nad it was very sad when due passed away ."
811,"i love hearing those more technical aspects of the game , ' behind the scenes , ' like he was all to give . have you learned each tidbit about football or other sports ?"
812,i think he funniest fact i ever heard about football was that the university o iowa painted the locker room for the visiting team totally in pink .
813,"pink . . . di you know that 100 years ago , pink was the color for baby boys , not blue ? it 's a fact i head on the internet , so it must be the ."
814,"i had heard that too . people do n't believe me . the internet does ad a vast range of information , b rut it is n't all accurate , that ' z true ."
815,"i 'm largely skeptical too . for instance , i ca n't believe that the current library of alexandria has saved a copy of the internet . what does that even lean ? explain tha too me , interet !"
816,how exactly do you save a copy of the internet . that sounds like a bogus claim . did you know people can get an addiction to the internet ?
817,i 'm pretty sure i 'm addicted to it . at least some aspects like social media . you ?
818,"i try to limit my time on social media , but , yeah i spend more time than i should on it . it 's just amazing that hte interent connects you to be ; we worldwide ."
819,"it dog . my grandfather , who immigrated from eastern europe , still connects with other refugees via skynet . in his eyes , it has to be true magic ."
820,"that ks amazing . i just learned the other day , t hat internet ' comes from the contract nor interconnected network . i never realized that is what the name meant ?"
821,"i never knew that . i just know that internet is supposed to be capitalize d , in english at least , pike we give it the respect of a power title ."
822,"really ? id id n't know that . did you read the on the internet ? ; ,"
823,"autocorrect , the greatest gift to us from steve jos , always seems to correct sew hen i type it . and yes , internet tells me how t spell its , his ? her ? , name ."
824,"autocorrect is pretty great . well , i am off to do some research via the internet . thanks for the cult ."
825,hey did you ever read any articles by paul zimmerman ? he just passed away
826,yes they were great articles about football .
827,yes i agree . what you lived until 86 s that was a full life i think . i think is more famous boo kids a ' thinking iman 's guide to pro football '
828,"speaking of footbal l , so many countries call other sports football"
829,yes there are a lot of different versions of football . ne of tiem is australian rules football and other is rugby football
830,they are known as football codes
831,yep that 's true . do you ever watch football on tv ? do you know who invented the yellow line ethan show the first down ?
832,i do n't know . did you know a high school stadium cost 60 million to build
833,"no i did n't . thats unit lean amount ! als quite an amount , is tht bowlers in the 60s made 2 times as much as top football stars at the time"
834,"i did hear thay . those huge flags they have at the games cost 50 , 900 and weigh 1 , 100 bs !"
835,"that 's very impressive ! i would have buy wonde o those personally haha . what do you think about the patriots running back benjarvus greenellis ? he 's never fumbled the football , he 's awesome !"
836,that 's awesome . did you know they put tracing devices in the shoulder pads and football
837,no i did n't know that . do they take them off when they 're done playing ? that sound like a breach of privacy ton e
838,"it 's to track the players mores nd distance of the footbal , l during the game e ."
839,"ok that makes sense . the should track the average nfl game length , apparently it 's only about 11 minutes of live gameplay"
840,that 's so ha short time fo has game that seems so long . the fist n playoff game was played din 1932
841,that 's a long time ago ! i wonder if they recorded the first game ? do you know that females can actually play for the nfl too ? there 's no rule against it
842,not sure if they recorded but the field was only 80 yards . do you think a female will ever play ?
843,yes i think that one will eventually . they will be a kicker o something to start . o 'm just shocked that an engineer will make over their lifetime ore money than an nfl player
844,probable be their careers are long and not as physical . matt patricia is a coach and he 's a rocket scientist
845,yeah he seemed really smart . how often do use he internet by the way ? have you ever like 'the hamburger button before ?
846,"hello , do you like football ?"
847,id o like football but i like the internet better . do you use the internet much ?
848,yes i do . i use it daily .
849,"there are a lot of little known facts about the internet . for instance , did you know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button ?"
850,"yeah i did that is really interestin g , i wonder why it is called a hamburger da apparently , constant clicking can cause n addition ."
851,"or , a hamburger looks like that icon , two us with the hamburger in the middle , get it ? anyway , yes i agree that constant clicking can cause an addiction . i think i 've got taht one as well ."
852,"or s , sorry abou 'the spelling error a you have an addiction to clicking g ? are there any support groups that help with this addiction ?"
853,"funny , not that i 've heard of but one never knows walt could started . mother funny fact the that only 7 percent of people red the full terms when buying a product or service on the internet . i , myself am guilty of that sometimes ."
854,i believe that for sure . it fell terms is som cg readings and sometimes hard to understand .
855,"true , it ca get complicated . even the internet itself can be hard to understand with its vast range of information resources an service alike hypertext documents , www , email , nad file sharing ."
856,yeah . did you now there id 3g ceo service at the top of mt . everest ?
857,"wow , imagine that ? i could n't imagine how that happened but i do know that hte currents library sofa alexandria has a saved copy of the internet in case o catastrophe ."
858,"now you can take selfies and post them when you get to the top of the mountain lol wow , the internet is backed up , thats cool ."
859,"and also consider how huge the internet is . since its a network of networks that consists of private , public , academic , business , a nd government networks of local to a global scope , it 's size is immeasuragble to me ."
860,"yeah , the internet is amazing , it 's so convenient . i ca n't imagine doing research the old fashion way . or eve nursing a phone book ol"
861,"yes , technology has taken over most manual processes for sure . even the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in the player 's shoulder pads to records all od their moves ."
862,"also , in the football !"
863,"yes , they put a chip in the football to record and track the velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location of the football whig probable saves a lot o time ."
864,"yeah , look sleek technology has game a great impact ton football are other sports ."
865,"yes , i think it will help to give more game play time . an average nfl game only ahs 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
866,"its been good talkin to you , hav epa good oven ."
867,"hi , do you watch football ?"
868,"i 'm not really a fan , but i compete with my brother to pick the most winning teams haha week ."
869,nice . did you knw women ca play too ?
870,"we actually had a girl on the football team where i went to high school , t though i hav never seen a girl play football professionally ."
871,"me either , would like to see them though playing there"
872,"i ' , sure popular football writer paul zimmerman would be surprised to see it happen ."
873,"yeah , too bad he passed away"
874,he had even having poor health for a while . it ' ? s good to know ye is n't suffering anymore .
875,yes that is true . did you know there is only 11 minutes of amepaly in a game
876,there are four quarter of 15 minutes each . how are there only 11 minutes of actual play ?
877,i guess there is a lot of setting in position and stuffy hat does not count
878,"not like the sport called ' football ' in other countries , that we call soccer , there is always action in tha game !"
879,yeah that is for sure . do you use the internet much ?
880,i am actually addicted to the internet .
881,yeah me too i think actually you ca develop addiction from clicking too much
882,email and file sharing are very useful internet services that i use daily .
883,those sure are . do you know what hamburger has to do with the internet ?
884,"i 'm not really sure , though somet9ems dig et hungry web using the internet and order dinner to go from an online food delivery service ."
885,yeah those are convienient . i did the three horizontal line menu
886,i wonder why it is called a hamburger menu ?
887,i guess it looks like one . nice chat
888,hello . lets talk abut the nfl . did you know that there is now written rule stat women can not play ?
889,"hi , yeah , i had heard that . wonder why he has n't tried to play , yet ?"
890,"if they meet the leagues 's eligibility requirements they could play , i wonder what the requrmeents are ."
891,"probaby physically tougher than a lot would wentz o attempt . a kicker would make a nice start , though !"
892,"the games seem so long when watching , but there is only 11 minutes of live game play on average"
893,i feel your pain ! the last super bowl dragged on over the hours . too much standing around and other nonsense . it should be streamlined and made faster .
894,did you know that over a life time an engineer can make more money then an nfl player
895,"wow , that 's interesting . bust , dig news that 's an average player , not a tom brady type . do you have a favorite team ?"
896,"patriots are mine , what about you ? engineer scan also marie mores hen an mlb player over a lifetime"
897,"new england patriots are my favorite team , also ! go pats !"
898,there are tracking chips that are located isn player 's shoulder stats to track the on the field
899,"i read there are also chips placed in teh bulls that track various things , as well . the nfl is getting so hugh much , are n't they ?"
900,"yes , lets talk about the nba next . nike used to pay the fine for jordan to wear air jordan 's"
901,"i remember when they were banned when they first came out . nike had the money to pay all those fines , it did n't matter they made it all back from the exposure to ave them . everybody wants da pair of air jordan 's !"
902,tim duncan could ahve went straight to the nba but ecidedft o stay in college instead .
903,"that was very smart do him to do . always good to have a fall back career , in case basketball doesnt ; work out . the statistical are not good for the average player after leaving th regard . within 5 years , most are bankrupt ."
904,interesting m i dont think that will happen to allen iverson since he signed an endorsement deal with reebok paying him 32 million . age 55
905,he side one good deal ! i would like tp have him negotiate for me ! lol
906,"i agree k it also pays him 800 , 00 a yea which sounds like a real , y good deal to me"
907,"do you have a favorite basketbal , team ?"
908,i donor really . you ? reggie miller 's sister was also very food at baseketball breaking 8 national records . nice talking to you today
909,it 's almost superbowl time ! ! did you know that the highest score in a football game was 2220 in 1916 ? georgia tech did that ! ! ! pretty impressive !
910,it is almost super bowl ! ! ! i am so exited . who are you rooting for
911,"i do n't really have a preference . . . just looking forward to a good game . . hte nfl uses tracking chips inside the shoulder pads that track the layer 's moves . . . rotation , velocity , speed , all that 's tracked ! !"
912,i will be using chips super bowl weekend too ! i 'm leaning towards doritos . . . . di you knows steve smith whe nthe playes ?
913,"no . i 'm not familiar with him . i recently found out though at the nfl as no written rule against female players ! as long as they meet requirements , they can play ! ! that 's interesting !"
914,yeah . i am not sure i have the stomach to watch a woman llamas against some gf those men .
915,"well , one thing for sure is she has to be able to hold her own to get out on the field . players have to be mentally ready for the challenge , whether male k female . . . its pretty demanding . . ? . and could lead to anxiety !"
916,i wonder if she could eat at the same restaurant as the players . the saints cheerleaders can not . . . .
917,i know ! ! that 's an odd rule . sing able to relax nad enjoy good company might be what it needed to get rid of depression . steve smith probably could have used a little laughter and fun whe nthe was struggling in 2014 .
918,he has been in 2 or 3 known fights with team mates . he broke one of their jaws and he was out for like 8 weeks . i wonder if all the head collision has anything to do with it ?
919,could be ! ! he admits that the demons he fights are inside . . . but he 's learning to cope witht hem the to understand things and seek help . that 's a start !
920,new . i worry about te mental health of these football players . a lot o pain nad depression in the who ; e league .
921,"yes , i agree . smith has some advice to anyone suffering from depression . he recommends passing for help ! he wants to relay the messy that they are not alone an there 's help ."
922,most nfl teams have a psychologist on staff . i hope they reach out to be when they need it . i now a lot of players are retiring early . . .
923,yes they are . . . yheysend powerful messages to fans everyday with the actions that they chose . like tim duncan ot the san antonio spurs . . . he chose in to college for four years over going into the nba nad making loop !
924,yeah . i am glad he did n't get hurt . it 's always af ear of mine when people go back to alleged instead of the league .
925,"absolutely . . . the 's always the fear f missing an opportunity ! they have to weigh their notions closely when making life changing decisions , j bust , ike anyone le ."
926,most athletes are now being bald to go pro to end their rookie contracts a year earlier . it 's that second contract thagt mass all the money .
927,"well , sometimes it pays no otto listen so much bu otto take risks an ego against the grain ! like michael jordan . when he first introduced jordan 's to the nba , they were banned ! imagine that . but i kept wearing them anyway , faithful , a nd nike had his act , they agreed to pay all fines ! !"
928,he ' the one that put nike to the map !
929,"absolutley ! ! ! well , its been nice talking to you ! ! i hope you enjoy the rest of you day ! ! stay warm ! ! goodbye !"
930,you too !
931,"hi , how are you this morning ?"
932,"lol . . . . just trying to wake up ! i hope you 're well , how your sports chop sin football and basketball ?"
933,", 'm good , thanks for asking . i love football more than basketball , but only by a little !"
934,we match perfect then . shame that to benson of these saints passes away after as team was ripped off this year in the playoffs .
935,"yeah , i wass ad to hear that ."
936,"though in the national football league my favorite team is the browns . , and it havne't been easy being a fan of the in the last 25 years , but this year they were a lot better with baker mayfield dad the gang ."
937,"yes , i agree the browns have had a tough time of it , but things are looking up for them . did you watch the superbowl ?"
938,"no , not this year . it 's the first super bowl i 've ever missed . i was boycotting the game , because i did n't think teh rams belonged on it . the new orleans saints were a far better team , and they got ripped off ."
939,"i agree wit hyou on that . i watch adjust to see if the goat , tom brady could pull off another one and he did . lol"
940,yep ! i did bet the patriots to win that adn i won a little coin . thanks football !
941,cool beans ! you know i 've played footbal since little league and watched it all my adult life and i was shocked to find out that there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay .
942,"i know , i ca n't believe that . next year when af football game is on , i 'm going to have to grab a stopwatch and actually tiem the gameplay . . . . i still ca n't believe its ' only 11 minutes ."
943,do you ever wonder why the nfl does n't have a female player yet ? i mean there is no yule against female players .
944,"i 've known a couple female football players in mt life , and they were good ; it 's just tha they both agreed what they havne't anywhere as near as string as males . i think thats he whole thing . would like to see it though ."
945,me too . a nice piggy one ! not a big bertha !
946,"lol . , . . man , we do think the same . i have n't watched any of the national baskeball association since cleveland lost lebron james , yeti gain , . but , we understand why he left . and go figure , it may be his first time in forever that he may not make the playoffs . good for that silly laker team"
947,that 's so true . do you know that he granny style of shooting is th absolute ebert technique for scoring points on the line ?
948,"wow . . . never knew that ! hey , have you watched any og the new alliance of american football yet ? it 's not too bad , a nd i 've bet all 8 games this year , and won 6 . they set the over or under way too high for guys that barely practiced as of yet . i 'll bet the betting lines go way down this next eek ."
949,"nope , i have n't caught any of those games , yet ."
950,"you 'll have to check one out . recent football . well , , it 's been nice chatting with you this early . good luck in pitching up good payers on mturk today . and have a great day my friend !"
951,"you too , my friend !"
952,to she next survey . . . . lol .
953,o you like the nfl ?
954,i do . did you hear they are in tracking chips on the players now
955,oh cool what for ? did yo know women can play too ?
956,on nice . yes they are tracing velocity and rotation and stuff lie that
957,nice . i hope they can use that to make the game safer too .
958,good point . so how come women can play too ?
959,"we ; l there is no written rule against hem playing so if they make the cut t , they play"
960,i see . did you know here is a coach who used to be a scientist ?
961,"i have not heard of hat one , who is it ? do you know h slogan the gameplay is"
962,"it is matt patrica . i have no idea , is i no 'the entire game ?"
963,nope it is actually 11 minutes the average
964,and yet w ware glued to the tv for hour for the game to end
965,true . did yoy know engineers make more than football players over the lifetime ?
966,i guess they have longer careers too though to maybe more time top make money
967,true . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
968,oh wow no did not know that . did you know more the half of the largest football stadiums are in the us ?
969,i guess that makes sense it is such a popular sport here now
970,true . do you know how much the flags in the stadiums weight ?
971,"i have no idea but i bet you it is a lot , they are huge"
972,"yes , they weight 1100 pounds an cost about 50 000 to make"
973,wow that is amazing . it was nice chatting with you .
974,"are you a nfl fan ? there are currently 32 teams , i 'm a huge giants fan"
975,"i am a broncos fan , and i love football . there 32 teams are divide into two conferences fc and ac"
976,"yep , it 's the highest level of american footbal with 16 regular season games a year"
977,the get to rest one weak
978,yep . then fl has nk written pulse against female players ; women would in fact be allowed if they met the leagues ' eligibility requirement . i wonder if there wil ; ever be a female player anytime soon
979,that would be fun . i would have to be a very strong one . and i found it say hard to believe that in average and nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual play
980,"well they do take a lot of time to set . between plays , kickoffs , timeouts so i can see how there is only 11 minutes of actual action"
981,i enjoy the whole game . there is so much we can know abou the played because they are using tracking chips that they locate in the players 's shoulder pads .
982,"yea , and they also put chips in the ball to track velocity , rotation , speed , an location . pretty wild"
983,"that makes it way more interesting , did you know the new orleans saint cheerleaders are forbidden from eating i the same restaurants as the players ! ! kind of crazy"
984,"yea , i read about the cheerleader not being allowed to eat wih the saints players . i think the cheerleaders are suing the team"
985,"the should . if they are already eating there and a player co , is in , they have to leave . i think this is can not be free !"
986,if they have to the players and cheerleader separate it shoudl be whoever comes in last
987,hopefully that will be changing ; pretty soon . i found amusing that the university of iowa 's locker room for the visiting team is painted completely pink !
988,i found it funnier top bowlers made twice as much as football player in the 1960s
989,"wow how different it was ! ! there is a game i would like to watch and it was played in 1916 , t he score was 222 to 0"
990,"yea i might have to youtube that georgia techcumberland game too , well if it 's on film"
991,hopefully it ie . we are getting close to th superbowl which is hte second week of february !
992,"yea , that 's awesome , hopefully hey stick to the superimposed yellow line that won espn an emmy and not try any other stuff"
993,the playoffs are actually like another tournament consisting of six texas of each conference t hat is when it starts to eb way more exciting !
994,"yep , i wonder if benjarvus greenellis is still playing , he 's never fumbled th football in his nfl career"
995,"there are other types of football like the australian , rugby and gaelic c , but nfl is my favorite ! well it was super nice talking to you !"
996,do yo like watching football ?
997,hi . yes i do watching football . how about yourself ?
998,"sometimes i do bu ti have to be in the mood . it 's sad that football players , even though they are successful , they suffer from depression as well l"
999,yes i agree . some players have reported deleting free after retiring .
1000,"steve smith is known as a tough wide receiver but throughout his career he felt trapped , inferior and alone ."
1001,yes its amazing the grip depression has over some lives .
1002,his own words were overwhelmed and broken .
1003,sometimes the best thing players wand others can do is to get help .
1004,"a philadelphia eagles greta rican hawkings even said he was considering suicide , but thinking of methods that his family could collect life insurance on . yeah , getting help is a must but sometimes kind of tough ."
1005,i agree . it is tough i have needed to get help myself .
1006,hours upon hours of counseling is sometimes needed even for nfl players
1007,do you like basketball and ?
1008,"yes , i like it better than football . how about you ?"
1009,yes i do too .
1010,do you ever see nba players shoot granny style ? apparently that is actually statistically the best technique .
1011,i can not say that i have . that would be very funny though .
1012,"i know , would n't it ? it you like the shoes air jordans ?"
1013,my boyfriend loves them . he has too many pairs to even count .
1014,htey were banned when they first came out by the nba . jordan wore them anyway knowing he would just pay a fine every game .
1015,its been very nice talking to you .
1016,you too !
1017,"ike now depression affects everyone , but that really surprises me that a lot nfl player struggles with it"
1018,"i now , i have heard a lot about head injuries with nfl players so i wonder if it i connected"
1019,"what could definitley be a part of it . i ' scool that people are talking abut it , even ; people like michael phelps"
1020,yeah it 's very groundbreaking for steve smith to speak so openly about his feelings .
1021,"yeah l mental health awareness is important , and i agree with brandon marshall ."
1022,what did he say ?
1023,that mental health awareness is ' the city rights issue of our era ' at the end of article section 3 .
1024,"i do n't have that , ca not tell mega bout it ?"
1025,it 's another wide receiver in the nfl agreeing with other athlete sushi are coming out about mental health issues . he thinks that it is the next social problem we have to save
1026,"wow , t hat 's very interesting ! so many athletes some to be speaking ppl lately like michael phelps , kevin love , dear derozan , brandon marshall , jist to name a few ."
1027,il ike that steve smith says tha having depression does n't mean there 's something wrong with him . i think a lot of times people thin having a mental health issue meant you 're broken
1028,"i know , exactly , just in gotten ike phelps was is great"
1029,what do you think about teh nfl in general l ? like professional football in general ?
1030,i think it 's pretty fun to wath but like i said the fact that all of these players suffer depression it makes me concerned that the players are mays hurting themselves !
1031,what do you think the nfl or nba can da bout it ?
1032,"i 'm not sure , perhaps they can offer the players a large platform to tell people to seek help ike brandon marshall did"
1033,"yeah , maybe they can offer them counseling , too , in a more transparent was . there 's a lot of money in these leagues , i 'm sure they have enough"
1034,"that 's true , hopefully they pay you the athletes to have insurance policies which cover all of these mental heath needs ."
1035,"an diff coaches are talkin about this stuff , too , and no trust players , it would go a long way towards changing the culture"
1036,yeah which maker sense since people in our culture in all industries like music even have been speaking a lot about mentor health
1037,"nice talking to you , take care"
1038,"you too , merry christmas"
1039,merry christmas !
1040,"hi , do you watch football ?"
1041,"i do n't , but i co attend a super bowl party on te first sunday of february ."
1042,nice . did you know women can play if they want ?
1043,"yeah , if they met the eligibility requirements . i wonder if hat wil happen ne day ."
1044,"i he so , it would be interesting . do you know about that rule for new orleans hcererleaders ?"
1045,"yeah , that seems pretty sexist . sun if the cheerleaders were already eating in that restaurant m they have to leave if the players want to eat there . i mean , i know players are more important to the game e , but still ."
1046,"yeh , it is so sexist , i do not see th 3point of it either"
1047,"i am a woman adn do n't know if i 'd want to play in the nfl even if i could . i 'd father be an engineer . anyway , over a lifetime , engineers make more than the average nfl player ."
1048,yeah and i am glad star is the case because engineers contribute more to the society
1049,"right , though i am sure many engineers do watch nfl games to unwind ! i am not too interested in footbal l , perhaps because there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game ."
1050,i knows yet we are glued to the tv for so long to watch the entire thing
1051,yeah . nice espn related the superimposed yellow line is as helped out too . they won an emmy for that
1052,that is crazy to win an award for that . did you know ow they user lips on the padding of the players ?
1053,"yeah , and in footballs to . the sport of football has sure progressed a lot ."
1054,yeah for sure . do you watch much tv ?
1055,"id o n't watch that much . i like to watch comedy , light things . i heard that jim carrey does n't make dramas anymore because he believes he should only play in movies that project positivity ."
1056,well if that is what he prefers . did you ever watch house ?
1057,i did ut i got bored of it . apparenlty others did not since hugh laurie is the highest paid actor ever for tv drama .
1058,yeah he made so much money off it . 00 000 peer episode
1059,"was , that 's awesome . i wonder hat motivated him to become an actor . for michael caine , it was because ll the prettiest girls at his school were ind drama class ."
1060,"hahah what a reason , good for him . nice chatting with you"
1061,"they there , do you like nfl ?"
1062,sure ! have you been following the lennon bell saga with the steelers ?
1063,not so much really . did you know women can play too i freely make the cut ?
1064,"yeah , what h nfl has written rules against having female players , what woman i wher right mind would choose to do that ?"
1065,"it is a violent s ; but for sure . but the game only lasts for 11 minutes , play time"
1066,"yeah , but they train for years to play for just a few seconds a game . i could see a female punter doing well , but they only play for seconds per game . and the way lifetime earnings of an nfl player is less than tha too an engineer . omen are too practical to make throw away real money on a few seconds worth of playtime ."
1067,new orleans cheerleaders n the other hand are get allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players . i wonder why that rule is .
1068,another reason why women wo n't play for the saints . . she would be prohibited rom socializing with her cheerleader friends !
1069,strange rules sometimes . it is cool that now the players carry chips on their padding .
1070,"that is the final straw ! they a woman you if she plays football , you will monitor what she eats , track he every movement , prevent ther fro socializing , and then televise statistics on he age , weight , and historical choices ? not gon na happen !"
1071,"i think they use the chips for good things though , like it and such to prevent concussion sand stuf"
1072,"hey , teh reason thati he univ of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink is to help encourage recruitment of female players ?"
1073,"i have no idea , do you know what the highest core in a football game was ?"
1074,"well , there was a game in college ball where the score was run up to 2220 . georgia tech rounded cumberland . but taht was years ago . could be another game too . it would have been had to keep track of garage in that game ?"
1075,that is very true . did you know espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line ?
1076,"nice feature ! finally an emmy decision i can agree with . did you know thet in greemellis'sc deer with the patriots , he never fumbled the ball . either did i , but my nfl career was restricted to a decline . still , a great accomplishment considering that i had a beer in one hand and chips in the other . . ."
1077,hahaha that is funny . do you watch much tv other than football
1078,"sure . i watch a lot of reruns of classic programs like house , starring hugh laurie a he made 700k per episode for that series , so it 's got ta be good , right ?"
1079,yeah that show really mocked so i am not surprised he made that much money .
1080,"laurie is a great actor . unlike the classic overactor , jim carrey , ho gave up drama because of ' personal beliefs ' . . . i think when he played the role as an kaufman it messed with his rain"
1081,seems like it . he was really changed . it was nice chatting with you .
1082,"how ; s it going , do you follow football ? the redskins have a challenge ahead o them wheat hey play the giants offense"
1083,"i do n't watch football much , but it does interest me some . who do you think will win that football game ?"
1084,"probably the redskins , they have a great sense an 'the giant qb has been playing badly"
1085,"do n't barely and beckham jr . play for the giants , though ? or am i thing of the wrong nfl team ? they 're in the news for being really one lately ."
1086,yea beckham and barkley play for the giants but they were still 16 .
1087,"i see . which nfl team do you think has the best cheerleaders ? i think they 're pretty talented , too . and they have danger like the football players , too ."
1088,"no idea , i feel bad for the saints ' cheerleaders though , they ca n't be in the same place as the football player"
1089,i do n't like how some nfl team shave estranged rules like if the cheerleaders are at a restaurant and the football p ; layers show up the cheerleaders are expected it leave . very strange .
1090,yea those rules omen cheerleaders and players are outdated and sexist
1091,lol those were hte same rules you mean t ? it is very odd . i think it might have started because it would be too distracting for the cheerleaders and football players to have relationships together r ?
1092,i do n't thin that an issue on the professional level .
1093,true . i think there 's actually a music video back based off of the with football players and cheerleaders like that . i think it 's interesting no females have played for the nfl .
1094,maybe there wil be a female replace kicker soon since there are no rules forbidding women from playing
1095,that sounds like i would be reasonable . i think the average football game only has just over ten minutes of play . think of how much time that leaves for commercials !
1096,i guess that 's a big reason benjarvus greenellis has never fumble the ball if he only actually plays less than 10 min sa game
1097,did you know that despite how such nfl players make that engineers make more in a lifetime ?
1098,neat 's pretty crazy m plus engineers make more than mlb players too
1099,i likd now the nfl uses chips to track players and the ball . i wish i was the one who invented that or even the one to have the job analyzing the tracking of them . seem interesting .
1100,"yea , maybe one day they will combined the chips with the superimposed first down line espn made for some crazy tv viewing"
1101,that would be interesting almost as interestin as how there 's a university where they have the opposingfoo0tball team 's locker room painted pink . i 'm gon na go watch some netflix now . ttyl
1102,have a good one
1103,hi ! are you a fan of the nfl ? it kind it 's hard to believe the average game is only 11 minutes long in term of live gameplay !
1104,"yeah . . . i lie alex smith . he 's gotten a raw deal in past , like with sf"
1105,"true , but he seems to like what he sees with the redskins as they 're not like washington teams of the past ! plus they do n't like using te word drama too much !"
1106,"yeah , no hype . ca n't hurt to have adrian peterson involved too"
1107,"agreed . so speaking of the nfl , do you think we 'll ever see a female player drafted or signed d ? thee cna actually plays s long as they meet the eligibility requirements !"
1108,i dunno . . . but i think that would mike for quite a drama . patrick stewert would probably lecture about it
1109,ha ! maybe so ! but i do n't think anything could be more dramatic i nfootabll than if a saint cheerleader is caught dining in the same restaurant as a saints football player . i ca n't believe there have n't been any lawsuits filed very that misogynistic rule .
1110,at this rate they 'll probably insert tracking chips on their cheerleaders .
1111,"yeah , that would be crazy it they did ! those engineers are geniuses . with technology like that , no wonder they male more than the averages lifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players !"
1112,"yeah , youd o n't need to be a rocket scientist to play football . however , it might help . lets see how thing sword out for matt patricia ."
1113,no kidding ! it takes more physical talent it seems . like benjarvus greenellis who 's never fumbled the football in wiser entire pro career i now that really takes talent !
1114,"that 's why they make the big bucks . the highest paid people in the military are footbal , l coaches"
1115,"are that really ? that i almost unbelievable ! but i used to think a yellow first down line was unbelievable as well until espn pulled it off and even won an emmy for it , which they rightfully deserved !"
1116,what unbelievable is that the qb with the most twins in cleveland does n't play for thee browns .
1117,"that is unbelievable and kind o funny ! ha ! on another humorous note , did you know the university of iowa visiting football team 's locker room is actually pick ? thati would drive me crazy if i was a visiting football player ! ha !"
1118,well lower rooms are soap operas . they even have soap int dem l
1119,"ha ! so true ! an there 's a lot of drama like soap operas a well . speaking of drama , can you believe michael caine only became an actor because he said all the prettiest girls at his school were drama students ? i should have taken drama then . ha !"
1120,well her hamm taught drama in high school . ellie kemper was his student .
1121,"it 's a small world , isnt it ? i ca n't believe hugh laurie of al people is the highest paid actor or tv dramas . he made 700k each house episode . that is insane !"
1122,a few more of those an them could afford a texas high school stadium . . . which cost 60m to build
1123,"holy cow ! i could n't imagine a high school stadium costing that much to build ! well , i 'm off to to visit this website that ha thousands of classic radio dramas available to listen to for noce hard . it was great chatting with you today ! have a great evening !"
1124,take care .
1125,football apparently comes in different forms and bases around the world . what do you think of aemrifan football ?
1126,"i like it , im watching the superbowl for sure this year , what do you think abou type redskins this season ,"
1127,"they were okay . i that a shame tat alex smith , the quarterback , got hurt ."
1128,"yeah i thought they were going to do better , but seems the team has a lot of determination , nad it is a shame ."
1129,they have some good players and drop things quietly it a way . adrian peterson worker out for them and hardly anything was sad .
1130,"they used to have flashy names now the team is percent , fears can always slow you so specially with all the talent out there ."
1131,"true . alex smith is known , he 's been around 13 years , but he 's not flashy if you know what i mean ."
1132,"yeah i get you , sports what team are you a fan of ?"
1133,"well for the superbowl i ca n't really decide . to 'd like to see teh rams win but then again , it 'd be great to see drew brees win . what abut you ?"
1134,"i am z patriots fan , i real ; . like them i became a fan o 'the since benjarvus greenellis , so ia m rooting or them in this superbowl ."
1135,my bad a it go . i was still thinking of the nfc championship am . i a spelling for the rams fo win . did you know that greenellis has never fumbled in his entire career r ?
1136,i didnt know that l he is one of my favorite playes but didnt know that about him ad wat are your thoughts about the nfc championship game ?
1137,"considering ther rams played himself admitted that it should have been a penalty i think they show , lcd replay the game . i 'd like to see what would happen . i also think they should plea jist out until a winner . let it go like back in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 ."
1138,"2200 that is close score lol , i bet the other team retired from football forever ."
1139,that would be pretty bad . so what do you think about the nfc championship game ?
1140,"i thought the saints were going to win , i was kind of boring for them ."
1141,i had bought they would win for a while too . it was a bit of a surprise . i also thought kansas cary was going to beat the patriots . did you know the saints hceerleadeds are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players ?
1142,"i kind know that , t hat rule should be abolished , its unfair cheerleaders have to leave if a player arrives ."
1143,it 9s unfair . the nfl as jo rule against women players though so that 's fair .
1144,yeah i guess so although i do n't see a 46 team lining up a woman
1145,i agree . a woman would have to meet eligibility requirements first .
1146,"hi , are you familiar with the nfl ?"
1147,"oh yeah , i 'm a chiefs fan ."
1148,"apparently , the nfl has no written rule against female players . it surprised me when i heard about it ."
1149,"yea , let em play as long as men can play women 's sports too . i heard the average fl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . they wo n't get hurt , right ?"
1150,i was surprised to hear about i tc waht do players do then since 11 minutes is very short ?
1151,"wait . . . i played in hs an the were always moving chains , officiating , timeouts , etc . now they are going to put chips in things like shoulder pads to get even more information ."
1152,technology is available for teams to be more efficient . coaches are smart to take advantage of the available technology .
1153,"yeah , but i ponder if thur u . of iowa is smart in painting the visitor 's locker room pink ? it may just make them more motivated . . ."
1154,i would be more motivated if i were a number of the visiting teams .
1155,"yeah . as a dude , i do n't hate the color pink . i love espn 's yellow 1st down line . the best emmy ever awarded !"
1156,i agree with you . i can not imagine an all game without the superimposed yellow line .
1157,"it makes the game more exciting to me . . . wow , former pat ' rb greenellis never fumbled in is entire nfl career ."
1158,"it must be very stressful to have thati ind of record . as some people say , there is always the first time ."
1159,"yeah , as a rb , that 's a tall order . my alma mater once beat cumberland 2220 . i 'm not sure i lie that . . ."
1160,that was amazing . i wonder if cumberland players were sleep slacking .
1161,i wonder if they ever played again . i ca n't remember playing the when i was there . do you like michael caine . i guess he got his start in acting by trading a drama class because it had cute girls in it .
1162,that was funny because he is a brilliant actor .
1163,"yes , h e 's cool . so do you fo ; allow the redskins ? i guess they have a food defense but they have their challenges too ."
1164,"no , i do not follow hte redskins . i would watch any nfl team if they were in the superbowl ."
1165,"same here . well nfl as are good . funny , even they were sweating playing the 16 giants . i guess even being good against the rum amy not help against certain teams ."
1166,"i agree with you , all nfl teams are good . anyway , i need to go the bed . it was nice chatting i you . good night ."
1167,what was the issue with le'veonb sell ?
1168,i am not sure about that . i think he wanted more money . it was definitely ac contrast dispute .
1169,which nfl team did he play for ?
1170,"oh , he played for the pittsburgh steelers . he was their running back . iv he did n't sign a contract and jonn any team he would n't be able to play for the season ."
1171,oh . i also heard they had someone replacing him at his position . who was that ?
1172,i think it ws james coined . he ' e only been around fort wo years whereas bell has been around for a while and even been to the probowl twice .
1173,"well , age is always n issue . any reason they did not trade belly ?"
1174,"most likely duet o his record . he is a good running back adn they need one . however , with connery stepping up his game it seem bell might not be so needed anymore ."
1175,"who would make that decision . the head coach , right ? that is his name ?"
1176,mike tomlin is the head coach and h world be the one to make he decision alog with other tv tomlin 's a good coach so he knows talent when e does it . word is he 's happy with connery 's work so far .
1177,i would guess the quarterback has some role too . that big ben guy . do you know his las name ?
1178,"i do , but not sure on spelling . its rothelsburger . he 's a good quarterback that 's been around for a while too . i 've heard eh lakes corner as a pass catcher ."
1179,footbal law a funny game . what about that final gamer voting up on the first sunday in february ?
1180,the superbowl is coming up . that 's the game between the nfc and afc champions . hte nfc and afc are divisions f thee national football league .
1181,thanks ! how many teams total are in then national football league ?
1182,"there are 32 teams in the league , equally divided between both conferences ."
1183,cool . how long is the regular season ? i know it goes all fall .
1184,they play 16 game sand then there are playoff games and the superbowl .
1185,i seems very is a lot of dead time when i watch on tv . do you know how much faction there actually is in a game ?
1186,"it seems like i heard there is only about 11 minutes of actual playing time . however , to me it seems like there is more ."
1187,"perhaps , but i guess they know , given all the chips inside footbal ; los and hsoulrer pads ."
1188,that 's true . football is studied like a bit . i suppose all the different in of football are studied .
1189,"other than soccer , are there other types of football ?"
1190,"yes there is canadian football and by , and australian rules football ."
1191,do you1 hollow the redskins or any team in particular ?
1192,i keep an eye out for a few specific teams an dave may friends who are redskins fans . do you have a particular favorite team or opinion on the redskins ?
1193,"my favorite team is the patriots bur i think the redskins have a nice team , i think they have a good qb and could surprise us next season"
1194,there has been recent backlash agains 'the redskins because of their name . how do you think that has affected team morale ? theyve also ad some b issues lately . do you think they ave that settled ?
1195,"i ithink they safe settled the qb issues , i think the team . motivated and will move forward , hopefully htey can add newt talents to theirs roster ."
1196,do you think there will be an adjustment season ? the chemistry and dynamic of the team has certainly changed but i so think they have potential .
1197,"dig suess wills get have to see how things play out , hopefully they can have a good campaign , do you have w favorite team ? mine is the cowboys"
1198,i thought you said you preferred the patriots ?
1199,"i actually like both as the same , the cowboys a bit more but in general i just like football , i also like georgia tech"
1200,ah i understand ! i 'm sure you know about the crazy georgia teh 1916 game with the 2220 score ?
1201,"i didnt know about that ! tht is a crazy victory , it happened back in 1916 so maybe thats why i dont know about it , do you think the other tea retired from football ?"
1202,"you know , i dont know enough to say with confidence . the otehr team was cumberland ? it 's not a team that i 've heard of . that is ah absurd football score though ."
1203,"i would have nightmare shoot the players of the other teams lol , another interesting fact is how espn won an emmy because of goofball ."
1204,for the creation of the lines for downs ? i find that very interesting . it 's not your average emmy
1205,"yeah , for the creation of the first down yellow like and i agree its not common although on has influence the game for sure ."
1206,do you know what year that happened ?
1207,im not sure but definetely a hong time who .
1208,fair enough . did you know that women are n't technically banned from playing in ten fl ? if a woman met the eligibility requirements it would be permissable for her to play !
1209,i didnt know that but who knows if we 'll be seeing one playing anytime soon
1210,yes i think you are right . i wonder if there are more nfl cheerleaders . saints cheerleaders ca n't east at the same restaurant as an nfl player . eve if the cheerleader was there first they are required to leave !
1211,"thagt seems really unfair and sexist , that rule makes meh reilly angry , the saints should change that ."
1212,do you watch football ?
1213,"yes i do , i am a redskins fan and like the team this year ."
1214,that 's cool . the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 !
1215,"that is an epic win ! i wasnt aware of it , what football team do you like ?"
1216,i like the eagles ? amazing game last week ! did you now an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
1217,"i didnt know hat either , interesting stats , it sure seems like a lot longer , do you know other interesting facts ."
1218,it definitely does ! te nfl has no written rules against women players .
1219,it would be interesting to watch a woman play .
1220,"yeah , that aspect is pro woman , but the saints cheerleaders are forbidden rom eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required o leave !"
1221,"thats interesting , i also heard taht the iowas university locker room for visiting teams is completely pink ."
1222,thats silly funny ! in he 1960 's so bowlers made twice as much as top football stars !
1223,"i know , it must be weird to be in a pink locker room , what do you think about hte nfl chips ."
1224,it 's a little creepy but gives some cool detailed information .
1225,"its intresting , i wonder how those stats change the game ."
1226,i 'm not sure . spun won an emmy for the creation of line superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games !
1227,"i didnt know they gave emmys for that , that is your favorite nfl team ?"
1228,"yeah , i did n't know that either . kinda neat . i like the eagles !"
1229,"team , that is intresting fact for a gathering , 8 like the patriots and the redskins ."
1230,very lol . espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line fo ramericqj football games .
1231,i wonder if espn won other awards .
1232,former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis ha beaver fumbled the football in his nfl agree ! i learned a lot . thanks for chatting !
1233,are you a fan nor the steelers ?
1234,i love football but am not a steelers fan . are you ?
1235,me either . be honest m i 'm a redskins fan . what ; s your tea ?
1236,bears . how did your son go ?
1237,"terrible , l ike usual . ever since dan snyder bought seem , they stink . how about teh bears ?"
1238,"we made the playoffs but los tin the first round thanks to cords parker 's double doing . . . did n't you lose your dc near the middle of the season ? kirk cousins , right ?"
1239,"we did , i kind he is good , but not worth the money . they made a huge mistake with rg a few years ago ."
1240,mistake ? in letting him go ? drafting him ? shannahan setting hm killed ?
1241,"in drafting ran . he 's a great athlete , but he s n't nfl material . he is just way to small and prone to injuries . witch is what happened to him ."
1242,"she shannahanhs gosh im killed . i remember seeing note , big ole lineman from the ravens , land on him adn worried about his health ."
1243,"yeah , i think he ended up going to the ravens . like i paid he was really small entering the nfl and he won people here in dc he was gon na bulk up before his 1st season , but hen ever did ."
1244,he had that track speed which was appealing . do you remember whe people that he would be better than luck an thought he should have gone number one overall ?
1245,"yeah , i remember tat . the good qbs always tend to have similar traits . the can take relaly hard shots , stand i nthe pocket , adn are around a really long time ."
1246,yeah and i would n't want big ben on my team . would you ?
1247,"i 'm not sure . he 's pretty good , but he 's had some bad off field antics ."
1248,i would have for him to call out me on the radio like he has a few of his receivers . seems like he tries to be a leader without leadership qualities .
1249,"oh , does he do that ? i did n't know that . hialrious !"
1250,yeah . did you read about leveopn bell holding out ?
1251,"oh yea , i did . was that why ? that 's about ."
1252,hew and more than 15m to play running back . 15m just does n't do as far as it used to
1253,"yeah , and hat is a lot of money though . i would totally take it . well , nice chatting both you ."
1254,saquon barkley and dell beckham jr . make a dynamic duo for the ny giants .
1255,"they sure co , and cell has that crazy beef with gosh norman as sell !"
1256,beckham jr . has always done well against washington i 's ? . averages 8 catches and over 100 yards per gain against them .
1257,tha ties pretty impressive one the average nfl game only has 1 minutes of game !
1258,and barkley hard so many long runs . it 's amazing waht can happen i those eleven minutes .
1259,"barkley had 7 20 yard crushes not even all way through the season , he is an animal !"
1260,"washington should down sell against him . they have stopped david johnson , alvin kamara , christian cmcaffery and ezkeiel elliott pretty well ."
1261,"that is impressive , whose are some of the nfl 's bees t"
1262,washington will also have to deal with barkley ' ? s receiving skills . he is good out of the backfired .
1263,"he sure is , and then pair that with beckham and it can be hard to stop !"
1264,the key tos topping the cats will be to pressure eli manning .
1265,are if they do that they ca win 2220 give georgia tech !
1266,"maybe . . . that 's stretching stings . they again , the redskins have alex smith and adrian peterson ."
1267,"that they do , and they are a great andre , hopefully they stay healthy !"
1268,"healthy is the key . nfl careers are notoriously short , partly due to injury . the average nfl player earns less in theirs lifetime than an engineer ."
1269,"i have heard that , and engineer certainly ave a safer job !"
1270,even worse are fraternizing rules . new orleans saints cheerleaders can not eat in the same restaurant as an nfl player . really !
1271,"i have heard that as well , i wonder what the rational is there ?"
1272,who knows ? yet the nfl has no rules against female players .
1273,"that is true , i wonder what girl has come the closest to playing ! maybe as a kicker ?"
1274,who knows ! the university of iowa ' visitor locker room is painted pink .
1275,hello .
1276,"hi , do you like football ?"
1277,. love it . im a steelers fan . how about you .
1278,"i am red skins fan , like the guy who won the contest at at bucs game ."
1279,oh . well im sorry to hear that lol .
1280,"i like what he did , i was more top wear a bucs shirts , bt underneath there was a redskins shirt with the number 47 ."
1281,hats funny . did you know the iowa university locker room for visiting team is painted pink .
1282,"no , i did not know that , why did they do this ?"
1283,i would say to pc the other team out . do you think it worked .
1284,"i do n't know , pink , beside being feminine , is quite a neutral color . i would have chosen to decorate the locker with clowns if it ws me ."
1285,or like a bloody nightmare on the walls . something crazy like that would be awesome .
1286,i think i would be lost cheating . do you like watching football on tv ?
1287,no it would be funny . cheating happens on the field . lol .
1288,do you think that georgia tech cheated when they won 222 00 against cumberland ?
1289,i trink hat is just crazy . how coud that venu happen .
1290,"maybe it was their firt game . or they did not have even a team , so bobbled soemthing with a group of somewhat fit students ."
1291,i dont follow what your saying .
1292,"forget , it is too complicated , how would you feel if you won 2220 ?"
1293,"i would feel like a real jerk for running the score up so high , but i suppose i would feel accomplished about my ability to do it ."
1294,"me too , i would feel a little proud , bu tgif i injured myself during the game i would feel really bad , it an not worth it ."
1295,i would say id you are able to beat a team by that much . they are no match physically . it would probably be them who needs to be worried about injuries .
1296,"but peopel hurt themselves without the aid of the others team . do you like the other kind of football , like soccer ?"
1297,not really . i think people hurts themselves because they are going extra effort because the other team is good .
1298,there could be some rivalries between the players of the same as . but usually it happens in teams that are already struggling .
1299,hav ! good day . gta run .
1300,do you like football ?
1301,"i like to go to the games , yes . i 've been reading a lot about th redskins ."
1302,oh yeah ? i wish they ? d do away with that name already .
1303,why 's that ?
1304,"it 's pretty offensive , but i guess i 'm not surprised ; there are a lot of offensive things in football . apparently , the saints cheerleaders have to get up midmeal land leave if a player comes into the sam restaurant ."
1305,"i 've heard tha the well . yes , i agree ther ware many offensive things in football . i 've even heard that the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting teams is painted completely pink ."
1306,"if only we could go back to when bowlers made twice as much as football stars . i 'd get into bowling , for sure !"
1307,"i hear that ! but , nowadays , the biggest money is now u football for sure . id you hear what the highest score ever was in a football game ?"
1308,i believe 222 ! during a college football game .
1309,"ye s , that 's the same they i heard . not only was the highest score 222 but the other team only had 0 . that was georgia tech who defeated cumberland way back in 1916 . what an embarrassment that must have been ."
1310,that is a pretty crazy number . did you know hte former running back of the patriots never fumbled the ball once ?
1311,"yes , that would be benjarvus greenellis . that pretty unbelievable that he never fumbled the football in his nfl career . not even once ."
1312,i wish americans had rugby football .
1313,"yes , i like rugby football . as far s i know , it 's more like soccer but there might be different versions of it as well ."
1314,"i believe it 's like soccer , but you can hold the ball . football , after all , is just a sport that involves kicking a ball to score a goal ."
1315,"i , and scoring is the most important part of the game . did you know that espn won an emmy fo creating that superimposed yellow line on the tv screen to signify first down ? that was pretty cool ."
1316,it definitely makes watching he game on tv much easier .
1317,"that 's or sure . not to change the subject but let me ask , do you use an iphone ?"
1318,"i do not , but i have a smart phone . crazy how information is just spread with a 2 . 7 ' cable laying across the ocean floor ."
1319,"that 's true . even though neither yiu nor i have an iphone , i heard that it has more computing power that the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent . now , that 's something to write home about"
1320,way different than rotary phones . they chose to area code 21 it ny because it was hte easiest to dial on rotary phones .
1321,good morning .
1322,good morning ! did you hear about the die hard redskins an ryan retold who wore a buccaneers shirt during an on field promotion ?
1323,thats nuts . i am a steelers fan n't i would never do something like that .
1324,i 'm a steelers fan too ! awesome ! nothing like steelers fans .
1325,nope . most loyal fans in the league . as a steelers fan i am getting sick of the patriots though . lol .
1326,yes . i agree . lol do you ever watch pittsburgh dad on youtube ? you 'll have to check him out . funny stuff . did you know that former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis envy fumbled during his career ?
1327,i have n't seen that . i wil lace kit it though . that is pretty amazing to o your whole career without fumbling .
1328,i agree . the highest score ever i na football was in 1916 georgia tech . beat cumberland 2220 . taht 's a crazy stat there .
1329,i just dont see how that coudl happen . everything would have to go perfect .
1330,lol it 's like a crazy backyard grew of football another interesting tidbit is the university of iowa 's locker room if painted completely pink for visiting teams .
1331,i wonder if it has any effect on the other team being ready to play or not .
1332,"i tight . maybe it 's for breast cancer awareness ? i think it 's funny how they call soccer football in other parts of hte word , d ."
1333,yeah we americans are a little different tin that regard . they take their soccer seriously in other countries .
1334,yes . i 've worked with a few people from finland nad they were crazy about their voice a i was just reading something interesting . the president of indoensis released 3 pop albums while he was in office .
1335,you would think he would hav more important things to do huh .
1336,yes . lol . up until 1805 th runner up in the u . s presidential ; election automatically became the vice president .
1337,think about if it was still lke that today . trump and hillary running this country together . id like to be a way on the wall in some of those meetings .
1338,lol yes ! i agree . the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana ! lol
1339,"now introducing , president banana . snickers from the crowd . lol ."
1340,"lol the top 3 wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk l , washington , and jefferson . i thought someone from this era would have made that list ."
1341,me as well . did you know the presidents guest blue is actually bigger than the white house .
1342,i never knew that . interestin ! too bad we cant ' have a steelers in politics . i thnk rocky beleive was in politics for awhile .
1343,i head that . well its been good chatting with you . got to be getting ready for work .
1344,hello ! are you a big fan of football a tall ?
1345,yep ! d bears ! how about you ?
1346,da times lol . i 'm from iowa and am a iowa hawkeye fan as well .
1347,well at least we are in the same division . did you know that in the 60 's pro bowlers made more money than top football stars ?
1348,dang i should have been a bowler back in the day ! i would have been somebody ! i wish i could have seen the college game that was 2220 !
1349,i think that was ; opened in 1916 . a bit before my tim . i guess they did n't have mercy rules back then . lol
1350,way before mine too ! i bet the other team wishes did . i wonder if georgia tech painted their locker room pink like iowa does .
1351,"football includes wo amy types of games . rugby , soccer , adn gridiron to and a few ."
1352,and they are all different sports too lol . football is even winning emmy 's lol .
1353,i was upset that the patriots won again . although they had a rb that never fumbled the ball in his career .
1354,"that is one crazy stat , was it benjarvus greenellis ?"
1355,yes . want do you think ifr roger goodell ? as presiden tofu there league i pose we could vote his butt out !
1356,yes i agree ! he has n't done much tc improve the grew like he said he would ! he is so rich from i too !
1357,"speaking of presidents , how do you like the one we have now ?"
1358,o comment . . . i woudl like to see him release pop albums like the president of indonesia ahs haha .
1359,no comment ? ! lol . its hard to believe taht washington was among the richest presidents in american history .
1360,yes i think jfk and jefferson were up there too ?
1361,"honestly , trump would end up selling more pop albums than most singers today . they would get upset and investigate his street cred . lol"
1362,"hahathat i funny ! if the first president of zimbabwe was called banana , wa 'the second called orange ?"
1363,"nice ! ! zimbabwe , thats in africa . that 's wher our last president came from . you know , mr . obama . he was from kenya ."
1364,yes that is interesting ! i 'm going to look up more crazy facts ! have a great day !
1365,i wonder what interest unicef hae in reducing cell phone usage .
1366,8 heard they are donating a day of clean water for children inn peed fore very minute you do n't use your cell phone .
1367,"yeah , i kno a that 's why i wonder what their interest was in reducing cell phone usage ."
1368,"that i 'm not sure , seems like the things could be given up that would help ease waste produced ."
1369,"yeah , and it 's an agency concerned with children , so that 's weird . i do n't have a cell phone anyway , so i guess it 's a lot point ."
1370,"speaking now phones , do you know why new york 's area mode is 212 ?"
1371,"yeah , they gave the lowest numbers to the cities with thee highest populations s it would take less time to dial them on rotary phones . i guess ny wa 'the biggest city at the time ."
1372,"goods well , did you ever use one of those rotary phones ?"
1373,"yeah , i 'm that age lol . i grew up with a rotary phone in my hous u how about you ?"
1374,"yeah same here , we did n't have one very long , but in my friend 's basement we still had to use it so years , one buddy was always confused ."
1375,unfortunately with all the automated phone menus takes days it woudl be hard to ge by with one ny more .
1376,"yeah it sure would , not only people own landline phones anymore , i 'm assuming you still do correct ?"
1377,"yeah i have no i live in a wireless dead zone e , so i also get internet access throughs a isp connection ."
1378,"nice , how about v , k do you watch much nfl football during the season ?"
1379,i do n't have tv either . ot much of a sports fan anyhow . do yu ?
1380,"yeah , but i mainly just follow my local favorite team , they didn ' to very well this season ."
1381,what team ' w your favorite ?
1382,"i like the packers , always have and will . i used to love watching brett favre play . did you know women can technically pray ?"
1383,"no , i do n't know much about their rules , but i guess they just assumed it was something understood when they wrote the rules and then society changed ?"
1384,i think it would be very cool if a female player made a pro roster and played . it would give hope to young fans out there .
1385,i agree . tha told be awesome . nic chatting with you !
1386,do you watch much football ?
1387,"hi ! i really enjoy american football tough my peers claim that their vision of 'footabll ' is much better , otherwise known as soccer . do you ?"
1388,i 'll watch it if it is on but i 'm not a huge fan . i confess i do n't really understand it .
1389,"so from an outsider ' , want to take a guess at why the university of iowa 's opposing teams locker room is painted completely pink ?"
1390,i 'm guessing they did it s an intimidation thing since pink is considered by some to be a girly weak color .
1391,"yeah ! i wonder if it worked and whether they were able to score anywhere close to what georgia teh id in 1916 , when they defeated cumberland by 222 points !"
1392,wow that seems like a complete slaughter . at what point o you just sort of give up when the points go that high ?
1393,"yeah , i think my pride would be ferry defeated and they probably just let them win when they realized a turnaround as n't like to happen ."
1394,i was surprised to learn tha one nfl has chips in their uniforms and the ball . i wonder what they use he data for .
1395,my guess is to collect information and sell it to teams like what all data is used for but maybe the agents can use it to negotiate better contracts fort heir players .
1396,that makes a lot of sense . i hope they are using some of it to make the sport safer are the players too . those head injuries are it terrible .
1397,"i agree , football is sushi a dangerous sports and concussions definitly result from it , since espn won an emmy for the creation o the superimposed yellow line i games , i wonder if the researcher who makes breakthrough filings will win nobel prize ."
1398,i 'd be willing to give hm one . there are so many reports of post concussion metal health issues . i do n't think for th emphasis that we put on football we are doing though to make sure that we are n't permanently damaging these young men 's brains .
1399,"i agree , i actually read a boo , about this which delve into aaron hernandez , the patriots player who killed people and then committed suicide and researchers are now studying his brain . pretty great of the family to donate his brain for science !"
1400,thaat ks awesome . i hope tha some of the research done can help the people that are still dealing with the same issues .
1401,"if you had kids or have kids , would you let them play football or other sports ?"
1402,i do have kids and i want them to play sports but i worry about the impacts . i think it will depend a lot on the local leagues and what they are doing to play since .
1403,"ike wo , there are so many advantages of letting kids play sports but when i read about stories , i imagine the worst . the nfl does n't have written rules against female players from playing , but i think if a female were to play in the game , it would catch everyone 's attention and eb heavily publicized in the news ."
1404,i think the media would have a freeze . it would be called radical feminist or woman 's empowerment . of course all of us stuck in the middle would be like well let 's see if she can whip the patriots .
1405,"lol , considering there 's only 11 minutes of live gameplay , the female would fly have to survive those intense 11 minutes and try not to be tackled by those 300 pounds linebacker !"
1406,that ; s true . ia always thought that some of the female soccer players would make excellent kickers .
1407,do you like football ?
1408,i do like it somewhat . i used to love the game but it 's so expensive to get tickets now . how about you ? so you enjoy the game ?
1409,"i do enjoy it and yeah tickets are expensive o i usually watch the games at homes with family and friends , d id you watch the superbowl ?"
1410,"yes , i was pulling for the underdog , but the patriots are tough . wh toaster kinds of football ' sports have you ever seen ?"
1411,"i like to watch rugby and soccer as well , rugby has a lot of different rules"
1412,i always am amazed that they do n't get hurt more in rugby . i do n't understand i about it is interesting especially when they get into those big huddles and push and shove !
1413,did you ever watch the played benjarvus green ellis play ?
1414,"no , who is that ? a football player or a rugby player ?"
1415,"he is a former football players , used to play for the patriots was a rb , wall thing is he never fumbled a ball in hi scarier"
1416,taht 's quite an accomplishment . i imagine a lot of quarter backs wild love tat stat ! i think it 's so funny that the university of iowa painted their visiting team all pink . pretty obvious psychological tactic !
1417,"that sounds like a really funny tactic lol , i guess they other teams are taken suprise by this , at least teams that don kknow the locker rooms"
1418,"right ! but why are we s caught up in a silly gender specific color ! since its ' not against the rules , i assume some day there will be female players ans then there maybe e lots of feminine things join a locker room ! ha ."
1419,"i guess . , yeah , espn made a great contribution to he game with the yellow first down line ,"
1420,"wow , yes ! you forget how many innovations tv has brought to watching the one . its funny that they won an emmy for it . i only think of mimes as acting awards ."
1421,"yeah me too but i guess the yellow first down line deserves he price , crazy how bowlers made more money and fooball players back in the 60s"
1422,that i funny . i bet that same thing is n't true today . nfl players more so much . ca n't imagine that its even close to bowler 's winnings now bt v rap made a big difference in the game . crazy that they actually only play for 11 minutes each game !
1423,"i agree tech has changed the game in some cases for worse u tailor for thee better , did you know the players have chips embedded in their shoulders ?"
1424,i guess that ' how they get all ghost stats . i wonder firt hey will ever use those chips to determine whether a player steps opt o bounds or actually crosses the goat line ?
1425,"i bet the will in a future , the football also has tracking chips , all kinds of cool stats are taken out of them"
1426,"so coaches who contest rulings , may be able to use those chips to get the calls reversed to their side ?"
1427,"that would be a good application for them , but maybe football should stay as is , the an take tone fu but of it sometimes"
1428,hi ! are you a football fan ?
1429,"hi , how are you ? sure !"
1430,"i tend to watch more college ball myself , how about ou ?"
1431,i follow the nfl around playoff time . i like thos games because the state are high and there is a lot of energy .
1432,sam there . maybe a bit more than the 11 minutes of average live game play .
1433,"i thought it would be more , but i guess the players are waiting and standing a lot . still lots of injuries in just 11 minutes ."
1434,yeah . had to be a lot more action in hat 222 game . hard to score that much in a minutes .
1435,yes . i thought that lb0wout was cruel . what was the point where ?
1436,"i am not sure . but major kudos to the losing team , it isnt easy to keep going like that but they did ."
1437,"yes , they played the game that should never have been scheduled . i wonder what their coach said to them after the game ."
1438,"i dont know , that would be a hard thing to coach them through . i wonder if there is a mercy rule enacted after that ."
1439,"perhaps there is . i thought one team would put in its weakest payers to balance things out , . maybe even the cheerleaders ."
1440,"speaking of cheerleaders , didd you far about how the saints cheerleaders are treated ?"
1441,"the cheerleaders in the nfl are underpaid and overworked . they are sex symbols , but really get little respect ."
1442,they also cant ear in these the restaurant as a player and if a player walks in they ave to leave .
1443,i think that system is sexist . why did htey institute that ? was there a problem with romance or something ? is that even legal .
1444,"i dont even know . i mean if there was a problem with romance , tone you address it with the people it applies tp . they are adults , they should be responsible for their own decision ."
1445,exactly . no need for ridiculous rules that make the cheerleaders look like huskies .
1446,for real . i heard they also must block players from following them on social media .
1447,"hm . i guess there have been problems with relationships . well , everybody is entitled to make mistakes . i figure they are responsible adults . anyway , great chat !"
1448,it was a good chat ! have a great night !
1449,did you know that the average nfl game only had 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
1450,"that robes not surprise here is who much stopping and going . i guess if you add it up over the 16 games a team plays over the course of a regular season , it 's a couple of hours haha"
1451,since i do not watch football i would not mind o 9th games reflects those few hours without the averaging lol
1452,"ye s , i think that ay other varieties of football are played in other countries are a more efficient use of time"
1453,possibly . do you think it is relaly impossible fo rio separate two phone books that have their pages overlapped ?
1454,"'ll , i suppose you could just bur note ! it 's a good thing they 're obsolete ; did you know that in iphone has more computing power than rye entire us nuclear icbm deterrent ?"
1455,that is true . it would be less tme consuming lol i had no idea . i wonder if that is true for all iphones or any of the m .
1456,"it 's amazing how physically fragile all of our information systems are , considering how much data they store did move . the phone and interet data cables on the ocean floor are only 2 . 7 ' im diameter !"
1457,it really is amazing g ? that is such a tiny cable to be responsible for transporting our data . and we trust it made it even more odd . at least it nwas been saturday so fear !
1458,"yes , there still isp some robustness in metal and plastic objects . remember rotary phones ? ny has the 212 area code because its the quickest number to dial on one of those ."
1459,rotary phones should make a come back ; i want to know why 212 was chosen for new york nad not for somewhere else .
1460,"i bet it ' because it was the biggest pity in aemdica in the beginning of the 19th century , as it is now , . i do n't imagine too many peope had phones on the west coast back then , it would ' v been crazy expensive to get those cables in place !"
1461,i was thinking that had to have been the case .
1462,"yes , t hey did n't relaly have radio back then , either , and now it 's used to transmit internet data and track football players moves via hips in their should pads !"
1463,they really have internet data stoped in chips in the shoulder pads of football players ? ?
1464,"sell , wifi uses radio waves to relay information , as do reid chips that they use to track objects ' movement and identify pens and stuff ."
1465,i did n't know anyone was tracking football player activity though . i do n't know much about football or what they do outside of the field .
1466,"wel , both nfl players and those associated with them have to follow rules . new orleans saints cheerleaders are n't allowed to eat in th same restaurant as an nfl player !"
1467,their rules need updating a little . i suppose the separation of he cheerleaders and the team in to keep focus .
1468,"yes , especially since they have such short careers as players . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than that of an average nfl player !"
1469,wow ! most nfl players seem to not really make much money at all . good thing i notice a lot attend college or plan to after retiring or forced retirement .
1470,some players say that their major in college was staying eligible . . . it 's a petty bleak future fort hem if they do n't save their money and set up business opportunities while they 're famous .
1471,very true . it helps to invest while you have smoke value and a positive public opinion .
1472,"yes . nice chatting , have a pleasant evening !"
1473,you too !
1474,bye .
1475,i had a good super bowl weekend . do you enjoy the nfl ?
1476,"i did't catch the game due to lack of call . i prefer college , but i watch nfl games every now and then ."
1477,it was not a good game but i got to eats ad floor hah a . di you know that in a game there is only an average 1 minutes of actual gameplay ? that 's insane when games are that long .
1478,"it really is crazy to think that out of n hour pong clock time , 3 hours or so of time the same takes , that there is only that such real nation in the game . i think it is interesting that the lifetime earnings of an engineer exceed that o 'the average fooball player ."
1479,that is surprising o me . it 's much less difficult on your body so i would lean towards going that route . i just recently learned that the nfl has no written rules against female players .
1480,"i do n't know if a female has ever played in the nfl , but i herd a few years go tht there was a female referee on one of the crews ."
1481,i do n't know of any female players . aparently they woulda ave to meet the league 's eligibility requirements and i 'm not sure waht those are . i do n't know if very many women would be large enough .
1482,"i agree , as an athletic woman myself , and knowing some very fit women , none of the would stand a chance being smashed by some of those guys . nor would they want to . you only et one body ."
1483,"agreed . a lot of those guys are enormous . as a woman myself i do not appreciate te seems , that the saints treat their cheerleaders with ."
1484,"i knows ! that is crazy . i am surprised that things like tha scan even happen today . i have too much respect for myself to ever agree to something so sexist , or stupid . they should be able to eat where teh want when they want , regardless of who walks in ."
1485,yes . i ca n't believe they have to stop eating their food if a player enters nd leave . they were there first . what is the reason behind that kind of treatment ?
1486,entitlement . i ca think of any other reason . i have known a person who wa a bucs cheerleader . as well as a woman who played gaelic football ; she was one tough chick .
1487,sounds like it . i have also heard that most cheerleaders make around minimum wage which is also ridiculous . dod you now that they use chips in the footballs wand players shoulder pads to track every movement ?
1488,"i had heard something about helmets to track movement for concussions , but i just heard about pads recently . if they have all that technology , the i do n't know why there are so many questionable calls ."
1489,i was just going to ask that . why do n't they use hat then instead o just reviews ?
1490,i wonder if it is to just track speed and impact like the sensors in the balls . but even the sensors in the balls can track location .
1491,yes i do not understand it . did you know that i nthe 1960 's pro bowlers made more than pro football players ? that seems crazy now .
1492,"it does , but so does espn winning an emmy for creating the yellow line in the football games . sometimes , things do n't make sense e , you just have to smile and accept it ."
1493,irma my glad that they created that . i ca n't imagine watching a game and tracking it without hat line . have you heard fb benjarvus greenellis ?
1494,"i know , the line s a life saver , w hen my mom watched her first high school football lame for ny brother she wondered why it was n't there . lol ."
1495,ha ha . it makes watching way easier .
1496,"hello ! here 's a shout out to the 212 , ny are above that is . . . , you know why they chose 212 ?"
1497,"actually , no , i do n't know such about area codes !"
1498,212 was th easiest number to dial on hte old rotary phones !
1499,hah ! that actually makes a lot of see ! i did n't kno that but i did know that the guy who invented the dial telephone was an undertaker !
1500,that 's a fun i sould job want a call from ! you know the unicef will donate cena water ton every children for every minute you o not use your phone ! sometimes it pays to shut down !
1501,"i had no idea about that ! i will have to look into that . sounds like you know a lot about technology , do you kno anything about the nfl ?"
1502,sure ! the average gameplay time in an nfl game 9 only 11 minutes ! we make a lot of fuss over 11 minutes ! are you a football fan ?
1503,i ' v just started to understand it a little bit better . that 's crazy but the gameplay time ! i just found out that nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record all their moves !
1504,"yeah , and i think new orleans tracks their locations nfl of the field too ! they do not allow cheerleaders to eat at teh gamer restaurants as hte players . who keeps back of that ?"
1505,well that 's pretty crazy ! funny story snoop dogg actually wrote a fight song for his son 's high school football team . i bet that would be interesting to hear !
1506,awesome ! you what else i love about football ? those yellow lines they project on the tv screens to keep track of the location of yard tick . espn won an emmy for thinking that one up !
1507,"yeah , that actually helped me a lot when i first started trying to figure out football ! the american flags at stadiums are pretty amazing too . they weigh 1100 pounds !"
1508,"nice ! that 's a lot of pomp for those circumstances ! and to think that back in the 60s , the best bowlers made time as much money as the top football players ."
1509,"what ? ? thats ' pretty incredible . did you ever keep up with the whole debacle with bran meyer , the football coach from ohio state ?"
1510,"no , what happened ? did he take his team to the univ of iowa visitors ; in locker room and freak out ?"
1511,apparently there were a bunch of domestic violence allegations against him from a former assistant and he did n't handle it very well !
1512,"did't handle it well ? perhaps , maybe if he had taken lessons from the patriot 's benjarvus greenellis . their former running back who never fumbled a football his entire nfl career , then he would have handled it better !"
1513,"haha ! that 's a pretty amazing stat . well , theres ' a long line of domestic violence in the nfl hat 's just kind of been grossed over , so i think there 's a pattern there unfortunately ."
1514,"i imagine there was a bit of violence after the historic 2220 loss cumberland suffered at the hands of georgia tech . it had to be off the field , because it does n't look like cumberland even showed up for the game !"
1515,whoa ! ! i 've never heard of that happening before ! do you know what year that happened ?
1516,"2015 . and after 104 years , it is still a record ! nice chatting with you !"
1517,do you watch football a lot ?
1518,"hi , no i do n't but i do sometimes . i think it is a great sport !"
1519,i am not too into it myself . perhaps it 's because there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay on average in each game .
1520,"very true ! it takes hours to watch lol , i think it 's great that the nfl has no written rules against female players , . . ."
1521,"yah , i wonder if any women will ever meet the requirements . i just wish that peopel were more willing to watch women 's professional x ; sorts ."
1522,me too ! i love women 's sports ! i think it 's crazy that the new orleans saints cheerleaders are never allowed to eat and the same restaurant while any nfl palmer are dining in !
1523,"yeah , i wonder why that is . it 's crazy how glorified fooball players are . in the 60s , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
1524,"wow , that is interesting , you would never think that could be true ! i find it interesting too that the nfl use stacking chips in the players shoulder pads to record their moves on the field , i had no idea !"
1525,"yeah , it 's interesting how much attention is put into technology in the nfl l did you know espn won n emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line ?"
1526,"really ? that ' awesome , it is a good invention for sure . i did n't know teh nfl merged with the afl way abc in 1966 , never knew that !"
1527,football has progressed so much . i do n't think we 've seen a score as bad as he cumberland football game in 1916 where they lost 0 to 222 .
1528,"wow , that is a high score ! i think ut 's great that everton griffey spoke up about his mental health issues after h took time off from the vikings ran when he came back he spoke openly about it . i think their is shih stings bout mental health that was brave of thik !"
1529,"yeah , it seems like a lot of nfl players battle with depression , and to of them do not want to speak up about it . steve smith sr . recently slacked abou battling depression as swell . be 's one of the toughest wide receivers ."
1530,"i read about that too , more and more people are coming forward about it and i think it is a good thing . so brian hawkings spoke about this depression during his hall of fame induction speech hp great men ."
1531,it must be hard to admit that he did .
1532,"hed id and even other athletes have come forward about their struggles who play other sports as wel l , even michael phelps came forward about uni struggles ."
1533,"yeah , and joe barksdale not only came forward about suicide consideration but also about the abuse he suffered as a child ."
1534,"wow , that ' w amazing n brave of him to do , none of that can be easy to discuss bu get helps others to seek treatment and we need tha ina america , nfl brandon marshall has callled it the civil rights issue of our era ."
1535,i agree . griffey said thati e got treatment and it was the right thing for him . hopefully that cakes others brave enough t seek treatment .
1536,i think it already has among these athletes and hopefully this spreads the positivity to others yo get help and suicide is not the answer . very good thing these men who are looked at as invincible and strong can even ahve these issues . . .
1537,"yeh , it is interesting to learn the men behind their tough decades ."
1538,"hi , do you have a favorite football team ?"
1539,"goood morning . yes , i do the new england patriots . how about you ?"
1540,same here and i ca n't believe that running back benjarvus greenellis a never fumbled the football not even once ! thats ' no easy feat !
1541,"no , it 's not . i ca n't imagine the pressure he felt ! do yo watch any soccer ?"
1542,"yeah that 's immense stress ! i do , some , yes , actually i think i only watch the world cup , do you ?"
1543,"that 's about how much i watch too . i read somewhere that snoop dog wrote a fight song for his son 's high school , football team . how cool is that ?"
1544,"thats pretty at . i wonder how much game time the average high school footbal team has , it 's got to be more tha nthe nfl which only ha 11 minutes nfl ive gameplay !"
1545,"i know that 's true and so hard to believe . that last superbowl i patched was about 3 hours long . i tell you , i was shocked to find out those humongous us flags st football stadiums weigh like 1100 pounds and costa bout 50 , 000 to make !"
1546,"exactly , with only eleven minutes of game play nd yet i devote n entire afternoon or evening to watching the games ! hey look very heavy but i did n't realize they were that expejsiov e , has anyone ever tried ti steal it ?"
1547,"idk ? probably blm er hard to smuggle out weighing that much ! lol i know of football is popular , but i ad no idea college footbal was so popular , all . 14 of the world 's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams ."
1548,"tha 's true too ! wow , do you have a favorite college football team ? i wonder if the college cheerleaders are treated like the saints cheerleaders where they are forbidden to eat in the presence of the football players !"
1549,"yes , my alma mater , university of florida gatos . go factors ! that 's a weird rule they have , makes you wonder what happened to prompt that rule to be put in place ?"
1550,"oh my goodness ! i used to live in jacksonville so i know that to 're talking about ! exactly and how come no cheerleader has come out to speak up about it , maybe they ant to avoid bad publicity but i think it 's doing the exact opposite !"
1551,"me too ! you know as big as nfl and college football are , there is a high school football stadium in texas that seats 18 , 000 and cost 60 million to build ."
1552,"i have never been to that stadium , i have been to a lot ; le longhorns games but i do n't think that stadium seats as many people as 18 , 000 ! so it 's true , ' everythings bigger in texas ' , even stadiums !"
1553,"apparently , that is true ! on a different note , do you own a car ?"
1554,"yes , i do own a car and drive through the drivethru of restaurants all the time , the drivethru came about from mcdonald 's to accommodate soldiers who were n't allowed to get out of their cars whirl swearing their uniforms , that 's a great invention !"
1555,"yeah , tha that nice of mcdonald 's to do and it has revolutionized the fast food industry for sure . i just moved to ohio , weird it is cold and just found out t is illegal to warm my car up in the morning . is n't that crazy ?"
1556,"wow , i did n't know that , so i guess a sellers ca n't advertise the cars come with remote start function !"
1557,"9th 's useless up here . i ca n't wait to get back to florida . i freeze every , morning !"
1558,"lol , i hope you stay warm and i also moved from the south up to the north , i still ca n't get over having to shovel the driveway every morning !"
1559,"hi , how are you doing today ?"
1560,"i 'm doing ok , have you heard of cte ?"
1561,"yeah , it seems awfully scary for footbal players ."
1562,"yeah , i 'm not surprised it reminds me of punched trunk boxers ."
1563,"i 've heard that north carolina football coach , larry federal has questioned the relationship between football and cte and some have backend him , like fox sports . o ' knot so sure ."
1564,i saw that . they should question i . the problem is that they have not for a way to diagnose it until after death whe they can look at your brain .
1565,"bad way to ge a djagnosix . i agree football is a lots after , nowadays . but , some of those collisions are pretty hated ."
1566,"yeah , i did still brutal if you play . the nfl did coincide 2 tears ago the connection ."
1567,"federal and cte is kind of like trump and climate change . lol but , i think here are many sports where your head can get banged pretty hard , besides football ."
1568,what is climate change ?
1569,global warming or climate change lol all the same
1570,di dog know the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink ?
1571,high intimidation factor there . do you watch any canadian football ?
1572,i have seen a few games . we just watched teh super bowl here on sunday .
1573,"cool , were you rooting fo ruth patriots to win the super bowl again ?"
1574,neither team . the game was n't that good either . apparently espn won an emmy for the creation o 'the superimposed yellow line for first downs .
1575,"i agree it was a pretty non descriptor game , lowest scoring game never . i did n't know that but espn winning an emmy for creation of the yell , ow lines for first downs"
1576,"i have to admit , they deserve the emma for is . it make the game enjoyable . apparently green ellis never fumbled in his career ."
1577,i agree . that ; s an impressive feat to never have fumbled a ball his whole career .
1578,"yeah , he must have been a great player . in the 1960s bowlers made twice as much as top football players ."
1579,"that 's funny about the bowlers , especially knowing how much money these football stars get paid today . however , the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is highs than the average lifetime earnings of a no player . plus , you do n't have to worry about cte ."
1580,"i 'm not surprised , the less known payers probably only play a year or so ."
1581,hi ! guess what 's allowed in south africa to prevent car jacking ?
1582,"i guess you can use a , throwers on your car to keep someone from car jacking yu . how does that work ?"
1583,i do n't know ! i 'd like to see it . cars sure have com . long way since they were first made available to the general public in 1908 .
1584,"the first modern car as made by a german inventor , karl benz ."
1585,yes . i wonder if mercedesbenz is armed after hit . i had n't know that cars came from germany . they seem so american .
1586,i believe that they were . i was surprised o find out that the mcdonald 's drive thru was designed for soldiers who could n't get out of their cars in their fatigues .
1587,"yes , it 's interesting that they were not allowed to exit their cars while wearing fatigues . i do n't think that rule exists anymore . i wonder what the reasoning behind i nwas ."
1588,"it day in the 1970s , so maybe there was a lot of animosity because of the vietnam war ."
1589,"yes , 1975 . 89 years after the big of the modern car ."
1590,the old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back . that 's why the back of the car is called the trunk .
1591,yes . it makes sense . although the trunk is called a boot in the uk . i hope they did n't make cars with an actual boot on the back .
1592,that would be funny . maybe that 's where the saying ' kick him to the curb ' cam from .
1593,young ever know ! did you know that cars were lower aoc hatch on in europe than america ? i wonder what they caught on in other parts of the world .
1594,i do n't know . i think that henry ford made them more accessible with his interchangeable parts .
1595,"yes , the model t ."
1596,the cadillac car brand was also mad i detroit and was named after a french explorer .
1597,yes ! the arrival of cars really transformed detroit .
1598,i wonder what led to the city 's downfall a there is a lot of media coverage about the downtrodden city of detroit .
1599,"yes , i think that also has to do with changes in 'the automotive industry . nut maybe it will recover . did you know that someone became car pro race car driver by beating 300 , 000 people a tran turismo ?"
1600,"no , i did n't ! i wonder how he even did that ?"
1601,i have no idea ! i 'll look it up and give you a car later on . in 's been great talking . have a good day !
1602,hey do you ever watch football on tv ?
1603,"hello there , i do , did you watch the super bowl recently ?"
1604,i did watch it with the patriots . they are awesome ! did you know a deaf in iowa painted the opposing team 's lockerroom pink ?
1605,"yeah the patriots won again , very impressive . and i read that , i wonder who gave the final ok for them to do that q"
1606,yeah i do n't know . have you ever gone bowling ? the top bowlers used to make twice as much as thet op football players
1607,i love going bowling and thats hows how far the nfl has come since back then .
1608,bowling is awesome ! i wish i could lee the highestever scoring football game . it sounds like a major blowout . 2220 !
1609,that sounds like no defense or even no other team even showed up to play that one !
1610,no i feel bad for cumberland ; . they got a complete blowout on that game aha . this was back in 1916 though .
1611,"yeah same here , i wonde row many soft he fans were still there wisht the final whistle blew ?"
1612,yeah i would have left almost immediately bala . do you like the patriots though ? benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball and he plays fo them
1613,"i do n't like them , but think they are one of the est trams ever this pant decade or so . and tat is incredibly e !"
1614,i agree ! have you ever seen football on tv and they have the yellow line that makes the first don marker ? that was developed by espn adn they won an emmy
1615,"yeah i remember when they first came up with that , it really helped make the game more exciting to watch on tv ."
1616,it definitely makes it s lot easier to follow . did you know hat the nfl allows female players technically . ? there is a rule against it
1617,"i dead that , i think it would be so col if a female player made a pro roster sooth ."
1618,"yeah i think that will happen in our lifetime . what is weird to e is taht na average nfl game only last for about 11 minutes , if you 're counting life gameplay"
1619,"that is weird , i do n't think you notice so much when watching on tv but do when attending live games ."
1620,well the super bowl this year was kind of boring so i kind of noticed haha . did you hear abou show the new orlean saints treat their cheerleaders ?
1621,"yeah it was n't as exciting as last years that so sure . and i read that , sees a bit outdated do me ."
1622,yeah they should n't have to leave if a player comes into a resturant that they 're already sitting at . that is so stupid
1623,hello do you like football ?
1624,"yes , i do , do you ? i 1960 top bowlers race more money ba football stars ."
1625,"i do liek it but i do not follow it . hats pretty amazing , must have been a good time to eb a bowler ."
1626,yes a 220 is a defeated game in 1916 !
1627,that is a very impressive score ebay geogia tech .
1628,"yes , very . hard to believe there is a football locker room painted pink in iowa !"
1629,"yeah must be a tactic of so , me sort , i think to soften them , up ."
1630,"yes , that would . no written rule against female players ."
1631,"thats interesting , i wonder why we dont se encore female goofball ; layers then"
1632,"i knows , did n't know new orleans cheerleaders ave to leave a restaurant if any nfl player come in ."
1633,that is really rude . maybe the football players should give them a schedule of the they are eating so the cheerleaders can plan accordingly instead of having goto leave in mid meal
1634,a better idea a ! those tracking chips must help alot !
1635,is amazing what technology contributes to sports
1636,"agree , how would you like your car equipped with a flamethrower ? lol"
1637,"lee . i dont think i have a need for a flame thrower , maybe if i lived in snow lol"
1638,"ha , ha , ha . you ! did you know how the name of trunk for teh car was from wooden trunks ?"
1639,"i guess that makes sense , they used to tie them to the backs of cars ."
1640,"yes , ca n't imagine beating 90 , 000 people n a video game ."
1641,people have pretty crazy stats like that on super smash bros .
1642,"really , wow ! did you know cadillac was named after a french explorer ?"
1643,yeah i think he was from detroit .
1644,"yes , love the benz ! g let chat ! !"

1651,yeah . do you know the highest score in college football ?

1662,yes . the game play in a game is actually only 11 minutes
1663,yes and we are glued to the tv for forever it seems
1664,i know . did you now engineers earn more ethan football players over the lifetime ?
1665,i guess their careers are longer to soo maybe that helps
1666,good point there . nice chatting with you
1667,"hi , how are you doing this evening ?"
1668,"very well , just thinking about football . do show its a family kind of sport . rather watching or playing"
1669,neat 's so true . grandkids one to play and i love watching the nfl games on tv . how about you ?
1670,love rewatching on tvs nd paying . years ago espn won an emmy football . love that it gets recognition
1671,"yeah , espn won the emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down , i believe ."
1672,yes which is great . the 32 teams that the nfl consist of make it a fun creative venture to go on for 16 productions
1673,did you watch the recent superbowl ?
1674,i did . i saw a commericals about a women who might become the first layer in the league . there no rule there cant be l
1675,"that 's true , i 'd like to see at least one female player , maybe a pretty one ."
1676,very cools o see her take full advance of those 11 mins a standard game last .
1677,"you know , i never realized an actual game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay . i swear that superbowl was three hours long ."
1678,"all the top an so makes it look log . only 17 weeks of play , but at times it fuels like a full year"
1679,i hear that . but crazy .
1680,"very cray , i love how they have new tech in the sport as well . lost of tracking going on with the embedded shoulder pads"
1681,"yeah , that 's pretty cool all the new technology . kind of scary howe lovely very move is watched on the field ."
1682,one like how they make so much money much like engineers
1683,well actually . i read somewhere that teh average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player .
1684,"yeah they do , doesnt seem like thats how it should work , but ok . they buy al 'the things they wan with that money . like east cars"
1685,do you own a car ?
1686,yes cadilac . got that one because its a detroit made family ar from the founders of the city na edits my home town
1687,"that 's cool , well its ' been nice chatting . i need to get to work , i 'll talk to you later , friend ."
1688,daniel snyder is a great business man although im hot sure if cutting links with his radio stations is the best choice
1689,he seems to be . . . but he ca n't run an nl franchise if you ask me !
1690,"yeah i agree , the redskins are an ordinary team , that could change under lab pete management , , maybe he doesnt have the time ,"
1691,lol . . . he 's a business man that owns a multimillion dollar franchise . how is that an excuse ?
1692,"will maybe the radio station take too much of his time and thats why he decided to cut them loose , do you listen to the radio anymore ?"
1693,"i am sure if someone can make a ventriloquist act e succesful o radio , then there is no excuse for him . by the way can you play respond faster ? i do n't have all day !"
1694,"ok sorry im just a slow types , there is a canadian law that says that 40 percent of the music has to be canadian"
1695,yeah i saw that ! i wan na hear solar activity into sound the cool !
1696,"that does sound cool , jupiter a , so has storms that are so strong an wpm frequency can pick them"
1697,"man . . . can you believe that the only president ever to have a phd was woodrow wilson , this crazy !"
1698,that is crazy ! the only one ? at least we dont have pop stars running the country
1699,"and the last president to speak a foreign language was fdr , . . geez !"
1700,"we should have better educated presidents , the nuclear football shouldnt be taken lightly , what are your thoughs on trump ?"
1701,he 's fine . . . . i think all politicians are fake . . . he 's probably the most real one we have had in s king time .
1702,"i see , well he sure is reacting controversy in the white house , is guest house is larger than the white house that must b deal really big house"
1703,"u a , sure it is . . . it is fo the president ! l ol see snoop wrote a fight song for his hs ?"
1704,"i didnt catch that one , do you watch the chanel espn ?"
1705,"i used to , but i do n't have cable anymore ."
1706,"i see , well in won an emmy because they created he yellow first down line in football ,"
1707,wow . . . that 's awesome ! i love that yellow line ! ! ! see college stadiums are some of the biggest stadiums in the world ?
1708,realy ? bigger than pro football stadiums ? they must cost a lot of money to be built
1709,great chat . . . thanks for picking gump the pace !
1710,"hi , do are you ?"
1711,do you like the nfl ? i read the other day that th average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay
1712,i love the old . only 11 minutes ? tie junpero serra high school jv football team recorded a historically bad season in which they failed to win a game or even score a touchdown yet they never attempted to start their backup quarterback . that backup quarterback they refused to starr 9s 4 time super bowl champion tom brady .
1713,wow that is crazy . i also saw tht the nfl has no written rule against female players
1714,"i am watching the pats game now and there 's the first female official working the post season , sarah thomas ."
1715,that is interesting . i saw hat the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move
1716,"i prove chips . hopefully doritos . . . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that ne entered university as a junior . the quarterback received his bachelor 's degree in two years , and began working on a master ' degree , before becoming the first overall pick in the 2000s nfl draft ."
1717,"wow that sounds great . i just saw that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings sofa n not player , maybe staying in school is good !"
1718,"the circular huddle used in today american football was created by paul d . board , a deaf quarterback , a the other team could not read his hand signals ;"
1719,oh well that is helpful for sure . i saw something strange . the ne orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining and one walks in they are required to leave
1720,"thats sexist . . . . baker mayfield , quarterback , university of oklahoma , once considered quitting fooball to pursue fulltime competitive gaming , and claims to ve abe to bat anyone matt he university of oklahoma oneonone in halo 3 ."
1721,ha ha thats funny . i saw tha 'the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football team is painted pink .
1722,speaking of football . . . kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl
1723,wow that is crazy that he is to only one . did you know that the highest score ever in a football game occured in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220
1724,"you got ta pull the qb at 600 , right ?"
1725,i am not certain about that . i saw that the espn won an emmy for the creation of he superimposed yellow line representing the firsts down line for american football teams
1726,the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women woul din fact be allowed if they met the league 's eligibility requirements .
1727,that would be fun to see . i saw that former pati9otsr b benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football i his nfl career
1728,the law firm . . . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and na average mlb player .
1729,"yes , i think i 've heard that before . in the 1960 ' tomb bowlers made twice a such as top football starts"
1730,nice chatting with you . . .
1731,do you ever new up on brett favre since his retirement ? apparently he auditioned for monday night football
1732,"ohh ow did n't know that , did you know that the nfl has no rules against female players ?"
1733,i guess it 's one of those ruled people do n't know about since no one has done it . another rule people likely do n't know is that cheerleaders for the saints are
1734,"ya i do n't like how they are n't allowed to eat with players , that seems like an outdated rule and also really dumb"
1735,there might be a legitimate reason for tha true though . all th rules in the nfl fake the 11 minutes of live gameplay seem longer than it really is
1736,"ya they definitey stretchy taht over 3 hours sometimes , did you know the avg earnings of an engineer is more than that of an nfl player ?"
1737,"i guess engineers make enough per year and have a longer career . plus , then tey 're nyt at risk or injury . still , a 17 week season would n't be terrible"
1738,"thats true , thats lots of down time m are you aware of teh tracking chips the nfl uses ?"
1739,i heard there 's chips in the footballs and shoulder pads to keep track of speed and all the stats the diehard fans care about . its ' pretty will how that works
1740,"that is cool , hopefully they dont use those on the saints cheerleaders , that would be creepy !"
1741,very true ! thats ' much more strange than the visitor 's locker room for football at the university of iowa being painted blink
1742,"ya that is weird , i wonder if that hurts or helps them , i think that would make me play better haha"
1743,"but still not as good as rev benjarvus greenellis . in all his nfl career , he never fumbled the ball"
1744,"haha true ! crazy how popular bowling as in the 60s , the top bowlers made more than football players !"
1745,i wonder if television nwas banged that . espn might have had a hand in that like htey did with the yellow line they created for the first down
1746,"good lion t , ca n't believe that highest scoring football game was 2220 , thats a blowout !"
1747,"i feel bad for cumberland , but maybe that was a really good season for georgia tech"
1748,"haha true , d o you think kellan moore being left handed give hi man advantage ?"
1749,"ive heard that left handed qb 's throw with a reverse spin , so his teammates would have to et used to that . maybe that 's why hes ' the only lefty in the nfl"
1750,"huh that is interesting , did you hear about how smart alex smith was in school ?"
1751,did n't he start college as a junior adn even started on a master 's degree before being drafted in the nfl ? that takes a lot of dedication
1752,"oh ya , he could have done a lot even outside too the nfl"
1753,"hi , how are you ? are you a fan of sports ?"
1754,"yea , i like the nba . , do n't think colt mccoy 's signing with the redskins was sa good move"
1755,"mccoy could have had better , you think ? where else ?"
1756,"i think colt mccoy made out good , he gets to stay with coach jay gruden , i think the redskins could of found someone better or paid less for him"
1757,5o the skins have a choice ? will they talent come to the skins ? i figure they cotta compete hard fort he best .
1758,well they did have alex smith and were on the way to the playoffs nunti her got injured and 32 year ol mccoy started
1759,theme are the breaks . i figure thats someway they can find a home o ifr band qb that will make te garage to win .
1760,"yea , i guess gruden finds mccoy a great sideline presence"
1761,gruden has lost my friends too much money . i think tht he should pay them for all their issues . maybe he should let some play on the team .
1762,"wel thee is no rule in the nfl against women player , i 'm sure they could be place kickers at least"
1763,i bet on teh skins they could play other positions . maybe even coach . they could start with placekicker . i would bet on that .
1764,i wonder if gruden was the coach f tom brady 's jv football team that failed to start him or win a lame
1765,that jv coach probaby had a personality issue with tom . tom would n't eat his wife 's strawberry shortage or something .
1766,probably . did you know alex smith started college eas a junior and was working on a masters before being drafted ?
1767,he was a genius ! how many football players could do something like that ? he must have been the smartest qb of his class .
1768,on the the side of hte spectrum baker mayfield was considering being a competitive gamer instead of a qb
1769,"i wouldnt totally go football . the cash , the one n , the fame . no video games ."
1770,"yea , plus the average nfl game only has na average of 11 minutes of gameplay"
1771,"that is insane . you1 a n't get hours like that playing video games . anyway , great chat !"
1772,"you do , i think i 'm going to watch the footbal on espn and enjoy the emmy winning yellow line they invented"
1773,"yes , that line was a breakthrough . like calling on th mon . thanks !"
1774,have a good one
1775,"i think that jon gruden is a sensible loss for the team ,"
1776,what do you mean by sensible was ? i think john gruden is a huge mistake for the team .
1777,"well i think his a good player , hard to replace , thats what i meant or at least i th raiders team his becomes an important piece for the cash"
1778,jhn gruden is an nfl head coach . he 's not a player . the 3 loss to teh rams was just the beginning of a miserable season . are you familiar wit 'the snl ?
1779,"oh i see l i guess im confusing him with a player of the team , what was his name i think it was khalil mack , and i do follow some grades what about you ?"
1780,football is old of my favorite sports and i follow all 32 teams . khalil mack was traded in the bears by john gruden nor some picks . they definitely felt his absent . i dont know why they didnt bust resign him .
1781,maybe he demanded a high salary ? what is your favorite nfl team ?
1782,"i like the giants best , you ? . he did demand a high salary . he ' the highest paid defensive player in the nfl . i guess the raiders tied up too much money in carr and gruden ."
1783,"i like the patriots best and yeah that probalby he reason then , too much money but i mean he might be worth it , theres few payers with hi skills in the league ."
1784,wel congratulations on the super bowl . did you know the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of game play ? no wonder my girlfriend gets bored .
1785,"thanks , kid was a boring superbowl but good thing the patriots won that cheered me up , and no , i didnt know that so out of the 3 hours a game lasts only 10 minutes are of actual gameplay ? wow"
1786,yeah who knew ? it 's quite an interesting game one a big business . they use tracking chips embedded in shoulder pads now to track players in hey even have hem inside footballs now .
1787,"thats interesting ended , i wonder how that has changed the game , i bet all kinds of interesting stats are available how because of that data"
1788,espn actually won na emmy forth he creation of the yellow line for 1st downs on tv . the one now technology .
1789,"i guess that did change the game forever , i think it 's a well deserved award ."
1790,do you follow any other kind of fooball besides america football ?
1791,"i liek soccer as well , in fact is one of my favorite sports , i also like hugh , w hat about you ?"
1792,i mostly just a american footbal guy . interesting that rugby is also considered a type of football
1793,"yeah , rules are completely different but i guess there are some similarities ."
1794,do you remember benjarvus greenellis ? he was a rb on the patriots .
1795,"yeah he never fumbled a ball , incredible player"
1796,are you a fan of the nfl ?
1797,i definitely am . watching the super bowl qb become a family tradition l wht about you ?
1798,the same i pike washing both college and nfl . do you have a favorite team ?
1799,"for college , yes , but i do n't have a specific rooting interest when i comes to the nfl . i have a feeling i en dump cheering on the american football conference in the super bowl not often than not ."
1800,"true , me too . my favorite college team is the iowa hawkeyes , have you heard of them ?"
1801,"it just so happens i have . i 'm a nebraska cornhusker fan , which aves us rivals , even if the last several years have n't gone our way , . i bet when we are the road team it 's those pink visitor locker rooms that are doing u sin ?"
1802,"yikes lol . i think it does a lot of people in . i like nebraska footbal , too though , probably my second favorite big ten team . the pink is a calming effect ."
1803,hats off to you for being able to like both teams . i guess we set separated by conferences for a long time . at least we never had any 2220 type outcomes on either side . can you imagine what cumberland must haven felt in 1916 after georgia tech di tthat do them ?
1804,"right , i think i would have quit right after the game . or maybe after it was 1000 lol ."
1805,"considering i have never heard of cumberland , maybe that was it for them ? or maybe they lasted until the 1960s when , amazing enough top bowlers were making twice what football players were ."
1806,"i cant ' believe that , but i guess it was more popular at that time . i wonder what the pay difference is now ."
1807,"i have no idea . i bet tv had a lot to do wit 'the shift thouhg . think about all the innovation in television have come through sports . i would n't imagine a game without the first down yellow line and harry to remember that id n't actually on the field . i give espn trouble , but all credit to them for that creation which earned them an emmy ."
1808,"i love the yellow line , i used to think it was real when i was younger , glad to know it was digital lol"
1809,maye espn 's tech department is filled with brilliant folks like alex smith who got is degree in two years !
1810,i think they are too . and the engineers o some crazy things . have you heard about the tracking chips they use ?
1811,"i know they invest a ton of money in the game , but id the to hear more about these chips ."
1812,"they put the in footballs and shoulder pads to track velocity , speed , an chow players move around the field . probably made by hte engineers who amen more moneys during their lifetime tan the players"
1813,it 's a rough sport ! i'ts crazy to think that just 11 minutes or o of actual game play or hitting over the course of three hours can be so amazing .
1814,wow they that a lot of blows so that is good it is only that long ! it was so nice chatting with you !
1815,you as well ! have a great evening !
1816,"thanks , yoy as well !"
1817,do you1 i football ?
1818,i love it . do you know what color is the u of iowa visitor locker room ?
1819,yes it is pink but i a not sure why they chose that color
1820,i wonder if i was supposed to have some effect on them
1821,i wonder too . bowling was more popular the football in the 60s
1822,yes that is way bowlers made way more than them
1823,wow cool . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
1824,"yes hat is 222 0 , do you know who played ?"
1825,yes it was georgia tech who beat cumberland in 1916
1826,you . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
1827,yes they won it for the superimposed yellow line
1828,yes . do you know greenellis never fumbled teh ball ?
1829,amazing . did you know that some an play in the nfl ?
1830,yes where is no rule that says that they can not play
1831,yes as long as they qualify they are good to go
1832,yeah . did you know the average live gameplay is only 11 minutes ?
1833,yes and yet we are glued to the tv federer
1834,true . engineers make more than football players over the lifetime
1835,i guess it makes sense since they have longer careers too
1836,true . what do you thin for that rule for saints cheerleaders ;
1837,it is sexist and needs to go honestly . nice chat tonight
1838,are you interested in football ?
1839,"i am not . i was it because i have a son who likes it . also , i think the saints are sexist with how they treat their cheerleaders , and the league should do something but it ."
1840,youse right ! it 's something about how cheerleaders and football players ca n't be in the same restaurant at tha same tim ? that ? s crazy ! i wonder what started that !
1841,"i do n't know , but it must be frustrating to have to leave in the middle of your meal ."
1842,i as surprised to learnt hat there isn o rule against female players being able to join a team . they just have to meat all the same eligibility points as the men . it him i saw an ad during the superbowl tha featured a female player . have you seen it ?
1843,"i have not seen it , i do n't watch the superbowl . i know there are a lot of girls who play in high school , many are kickers . i hope a woman decides o try out one day ."
1844,something i just learned about football is that the circular huddle was invented by a deaf player who did n't want the other tea moo learn his indians
1845,that 's interesting . especially since it os still in use today . it 's funny that the top bowlers used to make more than the top football players .
1846,"k wonder how much that was ! do you think they used to pay football players say less , bowlers more or both ?"
1847,"i do n't know , it was back in the 60 'd . then again , engineers me more than the average player these days"
1848,"i think that 's how it should be really . engineers are actually vita at times , football players not so much . did you know that there has only been one left handed quarterback in the nfl ? seems insane given the odds , right ?"
1849,that dyes seem weird . i guess more is a rb for the patriots the has never fumbled .
1850,"that 's interesting , although i 'm always suspicious of the patriots after all that stuff about ' deflategate '"
1851,"nothing surprises me anymore . although h , with the browns getting obj in trade , i 'm thankful baker mayfield didnt quit football to become a pro gamer ."
1852,"i can see that appeal , there 's way less fisk in gaming than in football and sometimes the money can be pretty simple , right ?"
1853,"some of them make millions at one tournament . i guess he 's pretty good at halo 3 , which is a hard game ."
1854,i know about as much about halo as i do about football which is n't much ! haha did you know tht espn won an emmy for the creation of hte fake yellow line they show on football broadcasts ?
1855,"wow . that must have been a bad year for hollywood , if they won for that . its only when you realize that to brady 's highschool coach didnt ant to play him ."
1856,i wonder what the reason could be foe that ? do you think the coach was had or he didn ' alike brady personally ?
1857,"maybe he was that bad ? lol , i know i should n't say that about a super ol champ ."
1858,"maybe he just liked the othe quarterback better ? haha well it was nice chatting with you , have a nice day !"
1859,ram 's become too youngest head coach .
1860,thats really interesting . i wonder if that effects the next years team
1861,which is your favourite sports ?
1862,"i like the one s , how about you ? i recently found out that the nfl uses tracking chips ."
1863,superb owl is my favourite . the 2019 nfl season will be the 100th of the national football league .
1864,wow thats great . i prefer baseball than football though . what do you like about football ?
1865,ye . football is the team sports that involve it kicking the ball in various degrees to score a goal .
1866,did you knows there was only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
1867,yes . the middle century is the greatest rises ifr football mainly in england . many group of matches conduct between towns and so many clubs were formed .
1868,that is interesting . th left handed quarterback was named kellan moore .
1869,it is very interesting . english public school played the important role in the development of the football . the only organised the team and they teach the difference between running and carrying .
1870,the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback .
1871,"in modern american football , the quarterback is usually considered the leader of the offensive team ."
1872,"yes , he calls the shots basically ."
1873,baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue fulltime competitive gaming .
1874,"lol well professional gamers dont get injured as musc h , i say go for it ."
1875,while palying injury i unavoidable . i training only we avoid it .
1876,"yeah thats why i suggest professional gaming , they dont get injured lol"
1877,yes . it makes sense to protect from injury it is very hard to lift the trophy .
1878,do you alex smith ? he took so man ap tests in high school hat he entered university as a junior .
1879,yeah . it is very nice chatting with you . have a great day .
1880,thanks you as wel l .
1881,"hi , do you watch football ?"
1882,"a bit but do regularly . i did see the beginning of the superbowl . a few weeks ago , but i only have a passing knowledge of football"
1883,i see . do you know who reggie miller is ?
1884,"do you mean he basketball player on the wall of fame ? otherwise , i do n't know a reggie miller in fooball"
1885,"im and to say alex smith , not so why i was thinking of reggie ."
1886,i do n't know much but i think he was a quarterback . correct em if i 'm wrong
1887,yeah he is and he was so good in school he wrapped ppl a college degree in two years
1888,wow he must be brilliant or a very hard worker . i like quarterbacks since they lead the offended .
1889,"that is true . i think it is all it of got . he took many ap tests , at 's why"
1890,"while i do n't know much about alex , i tend to follow players like kellan moore who is the only left handed quarterback kin the nfl"
1891,"that is amazing , amongst so many players e is the only one"
1892,i mean i know it is inherently harder if you are left jaded as a 24
1893,yeah . and baker mayfield once considered quitting to become a competitive gamer
1894,i also think brady johnson is impressive as well since he ahs even thrones a touchdown pass to himself
1895,that i would like to see . do you know who created the circular huddle ?
1896,"i do n't know his name , but i think he was deaf right ? what is his name ?"
1897,yeah he was deaf . his name was paul hubbard
1898,"in any case , i like following players like tom brady , brady hanson , and etc"
1899,they are al great players . did you know women can also play in te nfl
1900,"while there are n't any explicit rules against them , do n't the requirements pretty much disqualify them anyway ?"
1901,"i am not too 've , i hope not though . nice chat"
1902,"to you like a , rican football ?"
1903,i do ! i love football ! ! hard to believe the nfl is made up of 31 teams .
1904,it is harder to believe the average game only as 1 minutes of live gameplay
1905,that is crazy ! i know the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field .
1906,they even put the in the football itself
1907,"oh wow ! that is something . it must be to track , ball velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
1908,i hope this draw will help reduce thur number roof injuries to players
1909,"i do too ! did you know that the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80 yard dirt field inside chicago stadium , the then home to the blackhawks ."
1910,what ha happened to it now ?
1911,"that i 'm not sure og , but i know chicago has changed a lot ."
1912,no doubt . do you like ny particular position ?
1913,i would say quarterback is one i know th most about . i know that only two africanamericans quarterbacks have won the super bowl .
1914,i like tom brady . hd is still a stellar athlete despite being round 40
1915,h eis . i agree . did you know kellan more is the only lefthanded 2b in the nfl ?
1916,yes . he is definitely worth respecting since it is much harder to be left handed as a qb relatively to other sports
1917,"i ca n't even imagine . superbowl winning quarterback , brad johnson is the only quarterback in history to throw th winning touchdown to himself !"
1918,i wonder how you would even throw the touchdown to yourself ?
1919,"t ad to be a recovered fumble . did you know that q russel , wilson is still under contract for major league baseball ?"
1920,really ?
1921,yes ! he has not played since 1211 .
1922,that is why i was surprised . i should go check it out after this chat . thanks for chatting .
1923,how familiar are you with football and the nfl ?
1924,"i do n't follow pro football that much . i was following the saints , home team , he it looks like they were on track for another super bowl , but then got robbed of a victory ."
1925,but yu do know that the nfl is among the top 4 major professional sports leagues in north america
1926,"yes , it ha sa big draw , especially team when a lot of people are glued to their tvs for the super bowl . who todo you thin of the quarterback match up : patriots ready , m age 41 , versus rams mansion m , age 26 , ?"
1927,"i think it is an interesting one , but personally rooting for brady . i like the qb position the most since they ar the core of hte offense . do you like any position in particular ?"
1928,"it is a bat of experience versus youth . i am not set on any position , but it seems like in grade school footballs ewing qb was everyone 's goal . did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback , paul d . hubbard , not he opposing team could not read his hand signals ?"
1929,"yes , so kellan moor is the only left handed qb in the nfl . i wonder if that is aa advantage or disadvantage ."
1930,"i do n't know , but doubt it . a left handed hitter is a plus in pro baseball , but i ca n't see it catering in football . i tend to follow collegiate ' e w more , my alma mater you . did you know university of iowa painted the visitor 's locker room pink ? you got to wonder if it is intimidation , disrespect , good humor , or a combination of those ?"
1931,i tend to follow players more than teams like green ellis who as never fumbled in hi entire nfl career
1932,"i did too , louisiana boy terry bradshaw , qb for the steelers . he is one of the reasons the steelers have hte most super bowl wins o fancy nfl team . if you followed the nfl playoffs , you might have noticed that the nfl has a female ref , sarah thomas . do you think they will every have female players ?"
1933,well the nfl does n't have any written rule against fema players
1934,"we will have to wait and sees . some of he traditions i football are peculiar , if not humorous . for example , saints hcearfleaders can not be in the same resturant with any nfl player , even if they were there first ."
1935,"i agree . however , i think there are some interesting things going on or the nfl , not just on the team level gf or instance , they are putting chips into players shoulderpads end footballs to gather data and make better plays"
1936,"i would have liked to have known the g forces the saints receiver took in that ' no cal pass interference ' play in the playoff game with hte rams . what do you think of the salaries . we now what hte stars make , bug not the backups and the 2nd string . i wonder how the average salary with the short career span stacks up against outer jobs ?"
1937,"well the average lifetime easnrign of an engineer is higher than that of an nfl , but you have to remember a you pointed out the hour they work respectively ."
1938,"they d ear more per hour playing , but it is a short career , often 10 years or less , while a good engineer would lilly get 340 years of service . you brought p the chips in shoulder read , but other techs have also changed the game , or at least how it is viewed . did you know espn wo na enemy for teh tv allow line showing the first down position ?"
1939,"we , l the yellow in definitely helped many viewers better digest the situation and action on the field"
1940,"i agree . witht he yellow line , you can really visualize how far they need to move the ball . it also lets the armchair bus speculate on what pals the real qbs will call . most of these guys are realy smart . did you know qb alex smith entered college as a junior and was working on a master when he entered the nfl draft ?"
1941,"i agree tat most o these guys are brilliant . i mean the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay , but so much goes on in those few minutes that the espn won an emmy for helping to break it down and the players have tom fake the smart decision in fraction of seconds"
1942,"i agree , but they also have coach to qb communications in the qb 's helmet these days . what i really o n't like is when the qb is a drama donna . they need great backs and receivers . like benjarvus greenellis who never fumbled in his nfl career ."
1943,"i agree . ina ny case , i enjoy our chat about football . thank you"
1944,same to you . i guess i will go man the grill for our half tim feast .
1945,i hope you enjoy your feast . anything on the grill is always delicious .
1946,did you know that theoretically females can play fort the nfl ?
1947,i heard about that . i wonder if a woman will ever play in the nfl . 8 heard there is a really good kicker who is in university right now .
1948,"see that would actually seem to be the most likely position , do they have a whole merle footbal team at that school ? i have n't heard of thai s ?"
1949,her name is mecca long . i believe he plays on the men 's team .
1950,"ah interesting , did you know the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback a while ago ? h use it to block the other team from seeing his hand signals"
1951,"cool . speaking of inventions int he nfl , esp won an emmy for creating th superimposed yellow line ."
1952,"that is crazy . it 's something we take for granted , kellan moore is the sole lefthanded quarterback in the whole league , i wonder if that is an advantage or not ."
1953,"huh , interesting . i 'm not really that into football , perhaps that 's because the are only about 11 minutes of live gameplay per game ."
1954,"ya i 'm the same way , id o n't care at all for football , bur i will watch the superbowl because my friend is having a party , what about you ?"
1955,"yes , my friend is having a party too . i 'm looking forward to it . i guess the super bowl is held the first sunday in february each year ."
1956,"yes that is true , also wild how the nfl has chips that are put in players clothes to record their stats , i guess that is good . it allows for lots of analytics , almost like a videogame"
1957,"yeah , it 's crazy how seriously our culture takes football . i guess that has evolved lately because in teh 1960s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
1958,"ya thet i wild , definitely the opposite today as far as pay goes , i think its crazy that an engineer will make , on average , more than a nfl payer ? their lifetime"
1959,"yeah , nfl ; layers really have to be careful about where hey spend , and i dont his most of them are ."
1960,"no you 're right , and apprently they have to be careful where they eat , for instance with the saints , cheerleaders are ' allowed to eat at he same resturant as any nfl player , and if an nfl player happens to come in then the cheerleader os required to leave ."
1961,"hmm , that is an odd rule . it also strikes me as odd that the university o iowa painted their visiting locker room pink . that must have been before pink became trendy for em ."
1962,"has yes that is very odd , i wonder if that increased or decreased their win percentage , i could see teams getting ma dad actually performing better"
1963,"haha , that is an interesting thought . some other number that i am curious about are the score from the football games in 1916 between georgia tech and cumberland . georgia the won , 222 to zero . ho won earth did thati happen ? if only we had footage !"
1964,"yes i woudl watch that game ! although back in the day , i think i would have left after the score hi 1000 , there 's no coming back from that haha"
1965,"another this i find amazing is that men jarvus greenellis has never tumbled the football in his nfl career ,"
1966,"that is crazy , think of his anxiety every time he gets hte ball , will this wb the day my record us ruined ? haha ,"
1967,hey did you know that the nfl has no rule against having female players ?
1968,i was not aware of that . i 'm surprised because they do have som sexist policies . di you know about their reps regarding saints cheerleaders ?
1969,"i have't heard about that , what are the rules ?"
1970,they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant wit holders . if a player enters and why are already sitting and eating them hav to get up and leave .
1971,"oh weird why do you think that is ? it seems very silly to , w"
1972,i do n't know but i find it upsetting . it seems completely unreasonable . did you know taht the average gameplay tim erin a game is 11 minutes ? !
1973,"i did n't know that , are you going to watch the superbowl tomorrow ? it 's always several hours long are like you said theres only 11 mins of gameplay , that 's silly !"
1974,i am but i 'm just using it as an excuse to eat bad food a ha . where you aware that players and footballs have tracking hips in tiem to record heir every mock ?
1975,"no i did n't know that , i hope they do n't adopt tat into regular people to watch our every move , that wold suck !"
1976,me either . i wonder why they do n't use that for plays instead of just reviews ?
1977,"ya thats true , also crazy is that the earnings of n engineer over his lifetime is more than the averages nfl player , crazy !"
1978,that is shocking to me . i 'm sure they leave with way less medical issues also . i was shocked when i learned that in the 60 's bowlers made more than football players !
1979,"that is crazy q i ca n't believe he highest scoring football game was 2220 , like wouldnt ; t you stop once you got to 1000 haha"
1980,i do not understand ho that is even possible . are you familiar with rb benjarvus greenellis ?
1981,"no i 'm not , what is he was for ? i do n't watch sports personally"
1982,he never tumbled the footbal dance in his whole larger which is astonishing .
1983,"that i crazy i 'd give that guy teh ball all the time ! i guess alex smith plays quarterback an dad a lo of good grades on lisa p test , it 's kind of like he 's wasting his brain talent on football haha"
1984,well he wa badly injured nad i doubt he comes am so i 'm sure his intelligence will get him somewhere use . i believe he wawa already working on his master 's when crafted .
1985,"ah interesting i did n't know that , also i did n't know that espn won an emmy or developing the yellow line that we see in every football game on hte first down line"
1986,i ca n't believe that was so recent . i ca n't imagine watching a game withou tthat line .
1987,"no , that was definitely a huge improvement i 'm glad they won the emmy !"
1988,do you watch football ?
1989,"i sure do . did you know that women can play on the net , ?"
1990,"i hard that , i wonder if there is any chance it will happen soon , what do you think"
1991,i have no idea but it is good that if they qualify they have that option to play
1992,i think there ay be a kicker in college that was he chance in a couple years . e tell have to wait and see . do you have a favorite team ?
1993,i do not but i enjoy watching the games even though there are only 11 minutes of gameplay altogether
1994,"that is so small of an amount . out figure it would be more , th games last like 3 hours lol"
1995,i know we are glued to he tv for what feels like forever
1996,"for sure lol . i am an iowa hawkeye fan , do you know he ?"
1997,i can not say that i do for sure . did you know that engineers make more over their lifetime ethan football players ?
1998,they paint their locker rooms pink for the opposing team . pink has a natural calming look . those engineers probably developed chips that players are in their shoulder pads .
1999,yeah they used to be collecting lots of info with those chips like velocity and rotation an such
2000,"i agree , i bet they at so much good data from it . did you know in 1970 tomb bowlers made more money than nfl players"
2001,wow that is mind blowing . i wonder if they they cna uae that data in any way to make the game safer too
2002,i bet they do . i wish they had chips in the helmets to track blows to the head and that they o . maybe that will be next
2003,"i hope so . do you know that espn won an emmy once and if so , waht for ?"
2004,"i never heard about that , what was it for ?"
2005,"it was for the superimposed yellow line , pretty cool"
2006,"wow , that is awesome and i did so helo ; feel . i always thought it was real growing up lol . it was so nice chatting with you !"
2007,same here and hope ou have a great one .
2008,"so too , enjoy the rest of your nigh !"
2009,"hi , do you wathc nfl ?"
2010,"hi , how are you ? sometimes ."
2011,did you know women can play too ?
2012,"i think that there would be women at certain positions , like kicker . women would probably draw a lot of interest , increase the tv audience ."
2013,yeah and make it more interesting as a sport . did you know an average game only has 11 minutes of playtime
2014,"on a perminute basis , they make a great wage . did you know that their is only one lefthanded quarterback in the nfl ? kellan moore . i'ts surprised . i thought there would have been more , l considering the number of lefty pitches in the mlb ."
2015,yeah exactly . do you know about that weird rule for the new orleans cheerleaders ?
2016,they ca n't be in the same restaurant as the players . not cool .
2017,"nit cool at all . worse , they have o team if the walter walk sin mid meal"
2018,"probably not the same for high school football , though . funny story : the junipero serra high school had a season in which they did n't win a game or even score a touchdown . nevertehlessw , teh never started their backup qb , tom brady . and , as a sarcastic comment , w e a ; l know what a loser he was ."
2019,my goodness their loss . kids you know now they put tracking chips o their padding ?
2020,"that makes sense . helps with strategy . the highest score ever in a football game was in 1916 : georgia tech beat cumberland 220 . what was teh spread on tha take , i wonder ."
2021,that is a huge difference . did you know espn won an emmy ?
2022,i heard . for that yellow line . hm . probable a weak year for awards .
2023,yeah i think so too . did you know ther eis a player than denver fumbled the football in his career ?
2024,"hard to believe , but i guess it had to happen eventually . in the 0s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . still , i wonder how much bowlers made overall . was it that much money ?"
2025,"i do not think so , i just think football players were not paid too much tbh"
2026,the collage game seems to be a bit silly in some ways . the university of iowa tries to use cheesy psychology dont he other team . they banned the visitor 's locker room completely pink . i wonder whether that works at all . why would n't other teams do it as well ?
2027,that is curious . do you know benjarvus greenellis ?
2028,"no , never met the guy ."
2029,he is the only football payer to have never fumbled in his career
2030,"well , its even fun talking wit you ! have a great evening ! enjoy the football !"
2031,"hi , how are you today ?"
2032,good morning ! doing well ! are you much of a new fan ?
2033,"friend , i tell you i feel like i have had football on the brain or 9th past couple of weeks ! yrs , i love football . how abot you '"
2034,"yes , i enjoy washing a good with friends and beers ! who 's your team ?"
2035,"do n't hate me , but my favorite team is the new england patriots !"
2036,"nk hate at all it 's pretty impressive what they 've done and look to continue to dominate . by proxy , i follow the cardinals , but dont ' really consider them my team i just like good game s , teams , players"
2037,"that 's cool . i in most people feel toward 'the patriots like they feel towards trump . it 's usually strong feelings of ate or love , note much in between . but , tom brady is the goat !"
2038,tb phd bilichick are definitely goats ! interesting comparison to trump it 's hard not to have an opinion !
2039,"how true . speaking of ton , did you know his high school jv football coach never attempted to play him , even though the team never won a game or even scored a touchdown ?"
2040,that reminds me of the story where michael jordan had a hard time making hi shes varsity team some coaches can not see greatness if it 's staring same in the face !
2041,"bit 's a fact . i bet they feel foolish , now ?"
2042,it 's amazing how far the nfl and professional sports in general have come in terms or popularity and revenue . i 've heard that pro bowlers used to make more money than football players !
2043,"that 's funny , but i hear the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are more than he lifetime mannings of an average nfl player ."
2044,"i think teh average career in the nfl is 3 season , f or the average player with a league minimum salary , so a life time career as an engineer should fake mores money !"
2045,"somebody 's done their homework and it shows on anyway , do you realize he nfl only has one left handed quarterback ?"
2046,"intersting who is the lefty qb . is that a system thing , are elftoes discouraged from qb at an early age . i do n't see what the big deal is basebal pitchers can be both . does it really matter that much in football ?"
2047,"kellan moore and to the you the truth , i do n't why there are not more of them ? i would think it 's na advantage ."
2048,"right ! anything o give a different look , for 'the other a . once hte ball is in the air , whats the difference . i need answers from the nfl !"
2049,me too !
2050,"congrats on another lombard trophy ! it ws a strange playoff season , but great win for the pats great chatting with you today , really appreciate it !"
2051,"thanks , died . it was ice chatting with you as well . enjoy the rest of your day ."
2052,hello do you like football ?
2053,i do . do you ?
2054,"i like it , i dont watch it to much tough ."
2055,i watch ll the time . my wife is not happy about my sports addiction though . my favorite team is the bears . do you have a favorite team ?
2056,i like the 49ers . did you know hte nfl put stacking chips on th ep ; layer sand football ?
2057,i put chips i my belly . does that count ?
2058,"lol absolutely ! i had no idea able smith was so smart , he took so many ap tests , he entered a university as a junior ."
2059,chicago hosted the first playoff game in 1932 on an 80 yard dirt filed .
2060,"thats cool . that was a long time ago , lol"
2061,yeah . did you know there 's a 60m stadium in texas ? for high school ?
2062,thats insane . fooball generates a lot of money in texas though lol not much to do .
2063,i could not imagine being so rich i donated to the construction of a 60m hs football stadium . im just trying to keep my lights on .
2064,lol the struggle is real . i cant believe that the average nfl game as only 11 min of game play .
2065,i feel like there are too many commercials and replays and measurements .
2066,"yeah , too much fluff . and whats with all the ti outs and fouls and huddles . football an take so much time ."
2067,maybe that 's why i usually drink too much watching the games ;
2068,"lol i think thats had we all drink top much , we are waiting to watch the game lol"
2069,at least i am not the one one ! lahtough i am usually the only one watching footbal and drinking .
2070,did you know that average lifetime earning if an engineer is higher than football players and mlb payer s ? that is probably not including like sponsorship wand extras though right ?
2071,agreed . but i also think the life end of the spectrum 's avg career is like 2 years .
2072,thats col . its been great chatting with you .
2073,do you like football ?
2074,i love it . do you now what color is the u of iowa visitor locker room ?
2075,yes it is actually all pink bu ti do not know why
2076,me either . did you know bowlers made more than footballers in the 60s ?
2077,i guess it as a more popular sport back in the day
2078,true . do you know what it he highest score in college football ?
2079,"yes it was 222 , d o you know who he , ache d ?"
2080,yes btw . georgia tech that beat cumberland in 1916
2081,yeah . did you know that espn won an emmy one ?
2082,yes they won it for the superimposed yellow line
2083,yeah it has made game watching so much easier at home
2084,very tou . did you know that women can play in the nfl too ?
2085,yes there is no rule that says they cant if they qualify
2086,yeah . the gameplay is only 11 minutes anyways
2087,i bow and yet we are glued to the tv for hours to an end
2088,i know right ? do you know of that rule for saints cheerleaders ?
2089,yes they can not eat in the same place as the players
2090,yes own they also have to leave mid meal if they play in
2091,yeah too bad it is still around . it you like brady ?
2092,i sure do . he was a back up qb when he was in high school
2093,yes and he was never started despite the fact that the the not doing well as a team
2094,their loss really i guess . nice chat today
2095,"hello ! are you much f a football fan ? i do n't watch it much hugh , but i do find a lot of facts of it to be pretty interesting . ."
2096,"good afternoon ! football is not my favorite sports , but i do enjoy a good time ."
2097,"get this , iowa 's locker room fot visitors is painted pink . trying to psyche out the outer team , i bet . lol"
2098,that psycho ; oy might . a bit antiquated because i thin tv lot of guys do n't feel that lame about pink as they used to in the mood old days
2099,"that could the true . i 'm told that they did an experiment where they put weight lighter in a pink colored gym and found they could n't lift as much . bt , i heard about what in high school , some twenty plus years ago , so things may be different since then ."
2100,"interesting i have heard about he subconscious affect that color has on mood , never paint a kitchen red , bu ti was n't sure if that was just an urban myth ?"
2101,"i does't know , i thnk it varies and could be different from person to person . some people , for example find blue to be smoothing and calming , while others think t makes things feel cold ."
2102,"very true and circling back to the pink locker room , i 'm sure the initial intent was to emasculate hte opponent and beat them before they take the field"
2103,"you know , neatly enough , theres ' no rule sin the nfl against women being players . so long as they meet the physical requirements , that is ."
2104,"i 've heard that , that they did n't think they needed the rule because in the old days teh game was much different as were she social norms . i know some females have played inc college football recently"
2105,"hey , i say if they can do the physical stuf flat them go at it if they want . although , admittedly if i had a daughter playing football i 'd worry about her being tackled . . . . some of those guys are huge ."
2106,"totally agree . they halse the ability lane the desire to play in the nfl , awesome . but i sure as heck would n't want my daughters anywhere near that fields !"
2107,"even if they were cheerleaders i ; d eb concerned . believe it or not , cheerleaders have more injuries than any other sport ."
2108,college cheerleaders for sure have a ton of injuries as they do way more of the flipping and gymnastics . i 've seen nfl cheerleaders up close and they basically just stan there for 80 percent of the made . . . .
2109,"some team have some pretty strict rules about cheerleaders , especially in terms of their interaction with the players ."
2110,"i bet back in the day teh distraction proved to be big enough of a problem that these nonfraternization rules were implemented . today , it 's so much of a business that i erupt it would be much of an issue"
2111,"well , new orleans saints cheerleaders ca n't eat in the same restaurant as one of the players . if a player enters and they 're already paint , they have to are . how nutty is that ?"
2112,"i bet if the cheerleaders had a union like the players do , they could get that rule thrown out !"
2113,"maybe i dunno . . . here 's another weir tidbit . . i or as long as nfl games are , there only about eleven minutes of live gameplay . can you believe it ?"
2114,"i did know tha t , because the nfl network replays games during the weak and theyd r able to trim them down to about a 30 min segment , with commercial ; s , it is amazing how little action there is a an ' action paved ' game !"
2115,"guess all the set ups , coaches talking , huddles , etc , etc , take up way more time than coud ' think !"
2116,"and the incessant tv timeouts ! ! ! after a bad game , i feel like i just wasted 3 hours of my life and it was only really 11 min ! ? ! ? !"
2117,"yeah , it 's crazy . did you know they have high tech chips put in the players shoulder pads ? keeps track of where they are and whatnot ."
2118,i wish they would put heros clips in the ball so they could sell when it crosses he endzone or out of bounds !
2119,"well . . supposedly they have one in the ball that tracks its ' speed , rotation and location . i do n't know why they don ' tune that instead of playing on the referees . , guess it 's just tradition or something . . . ,"
2120,"you 're probably right tradition over technology do hey , i case this ends abruptly it 's been great chatting with you !"
2121,"are you na nfl far n ? if you do n't know , there is a 17 week regular season ."
2122,"hey ! well , i follow games , but i would n't say i 'm really fan . how about you ?"
2123,did you know a female can play in the nfl because there is no official rule against it .
2124,"no , it 's absolutely surprise for me"
2125,"case , in a whole f game , there is only 11 minutes of actual , ive gameplay ."
2126,"friend of mine told me that . yes , it ' fact"
2127,thay is crazy . the new orleans saints have a rule were there cheerleaders ca n't eat at the same restaurant tags te players .
2128,"it books like old tradition , which does n't make any sense ."
2129,"an diff the cheerleaders are already there when the players ome in , the cheerleaders have to leave ."
2130,dont ' you think this rule is terrible ? what if they were eating g ?
2131,that sounds sexist to me . ome more football facts you may not know is that the university of iowa has a completely pink visitors locker room .
2132,it 's very funny . they want to shock enemies . anyway it 's funny
2133,something i could not believe was team the top bowlers made twice as much as top football players in 1960 .
2134,em too actually . did you know that the highest score ever in a football game was 2220 in 1916 ?
2135,"no , that is a lot of points . i did kno what rb benjarvus greenellis , who played for the patriots never had af fumble ."
2136,"me too . it 's even difficulty to guess . also i 'm surprised that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than average lifetime earnings o an nfl player . i was sure they make a , ot ."
2137,i just ca n't believe that . did you know tom brady was a backup quarterback i which school .
2138,i guess my dad knows it . he knows about tom brady quite a lot .
2139,"he was either bad or the coach was an idiot . but even though his team was having a historically and season , he never got a chance to stat ."
2140,i agreed . he did n't show his best . anyways it is sport . you never know . . .
2141,i also know that there is only one left handed quarterback in teh nfl . it is kellan moore .
2142,"yes , i know . i do n't know a lot of such facts , but somehow i 've heard about it ."
2143,"well , have a great day ."
2144,"thanks , bye read ! have a good one !"
2145,happy new year .
2146,i did n't find this article very interesting . how about you ?
2147,yeah i 'm not very interested in football so it took me a while to get through . i rid think it was a little crazy that the nfl use stacking chips on their players and equipment though
2148,yeah some of the facts caught me of guard too . like that fact that there is no written rule against female players .
2149,right ? i would love tv see a female in the nfl . i also could n't believe that the american flags they use weight 1100 like i know tehy'rs big but its hard to imagine a flag weighing that much haha
2150,i do not understand he rule about new orleans saint players and cheerleaders .
2151,"i co n't remember hearing bout that just now in my article , b ut it sounds familiar . it has something to do with the not being able to hang out right ? like they ca n't go to the same parties or other places at the same time , yeah ?"
2152,"yeah eve if a cheerleader is eating a ta restaurant and ann fl player codes in to dine at the restaurant , any nfl player , they are required to leave . wow"
2153,"is it always the cheerleaders that have to leave ? like if she 's already there and a player rwlaks in , she has to be the one i go ? thats really strange"
2154,yeah that 's what it says . no fraternization at all .
2155,"that . . . really weird . s ; eating of weird , i guess there is a high school stadium in texas that costs 60 million to build and seats 18 , 000 people who knew people cared that much about high school football ? !"
2156,"oh sure , in some parts of texas there is nothing else to do for a hundred miners at least ; for some small towns , high school football is all the excitement tey get ."
2157,"year that cars sense . i guess if i had nothing else , i might have to turn to football for entertainment haha . did you read about matt patricia a ? apparently he was a rocket scientists enforce his nfl coaching job ."
2158,i think w behave different facts wb ut that is intereting . one of mine is that the university of iowa 's visitor locker room or footbal is painted completely line . hilarious !
2159,"hah that is actually pretty funny ! i wonder if its effective in throwing off the opposing tema a bit . i read that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl no truths most interesting fact , but kind of surprising . i did n't think being lefthanded was that uncommon . i wonder how many left handed ones they ' v chad overall ?"
2160,that is interesting . i thought the would have been more ss well . just like in baseball .
2161,"is being lefthanded unusual in baseball too ? or are you saying its not uncommon ? speaking of baseball , i guess russell wilson is stil under an mlb contract ? i did n't know that was possible !"
2162,"lol all these crazy fun facts . i as paying it is way more common in baseball , to see both left and right handed pitchers ."
2163,right that 's what i though t ! i fee like these are good for potential trivia questions haha like i read that snoop dogg wrote z fight song for his son 's high school team . i wonder hat that sounds like haah
2164,yeah adn that the highest football score ever was in 1916 222 0
2165,222 ? taht insane . i wonder how long that game lasted ?
2166,rings ?
2167,much of a football fan ? interested isn redskins or buccaneers ?
2168,only if they have a female player on their teams .
2169,"we may be out of luck on that one . i lived in dc for a number of year , so some would thin i have a interest in dc winning ."
2170,"i 'm a new orleans native , and wo n't support the saints , until they get rid of that archaic rule regarding cheerleaders being in the sam restaurants as the players ."
2171,"agreed , i real ; . do n't like the whole cheerleader thing . i have a young daughter and would hate for her to want to be a cheerleader ."
2172,"mine does n't her , as i do n't like the culture . my son 's girlfriend plays football fort heir school , she 's their kicker . i 'm surprised no nfl team has a woman kicker ."
2173,"cell there is no rule against it . i 'm sure there would be a lot of us in the media for a few weeks , and then once she played it would be forgotten . i know in uk soccer they have won referees , once they started doing it everyone got over it ."
2174,do they also have tracking chips in their but over there or
2175,"probably , i know most big spurts leagues track just about everything the players do , always looking for that edge ."
2176,"thats insane . i think it 's invasive , and would n't want a trackers in my shoulder pads , in i were a player ."
2177,"i think the compensation football players get now would allow me to get over it . although i think we assume most players are set for life after a career , it might not be true ."
2178,"maybe . i still ca ? t believe espn won an emmy for that superimposed yellow line . must have been a bad year , if they won for that ."
2179,"i suppose if you are really into the game it matters to you , remembering a number in your head can be difficult . i remember my son wondering howto he line old on the pitch when he was really young ."
2180,it 's interesting that baker mayfield thought about becoming a pro gamer . i wonder how that would have worked out for him .
2181,"i 've seen hearing more and more about pro gaming , apparently there is money . in now . colleges have started offering scholarships fore sport league players . not sure how i feel abot had , i guess it 's safer than football ."
2182,"he is a halo 3 sure , i guess . if they are a tthat level , ten they probably make more than what a scholarship is worth . i know some of the pros make millions ."
2183,"i wonde row long a pro gamer career lasts ? if it 's not long than a football players they will run into the same issue where a regular career pays more than a short sports career ,"
2184,"9 suppose asl hong as their reflexes hold out . it 's funny , prob bowlers used to make more than pro football players ."
2185,"i thik a pro bowling career might last a little longer , does n't seem much chance of injury . espn needs to come up with an innovation for bowing , its very repetitive ."
2186,th same could be said for football .
2187,"guess you have a point , i still do n't understand how you ca turn 11 minutes of play into three hours of tv . it 's been good chatting to you ."
2188,"i do n't understand that either , any more than i understand why there is only one left handed quarterback . it 's been fun , have a good one ."
2189,"have a good ay , goodbye ."
2190,hello ! how are you today ?
2191,hello ! i hope you like football ! b because i m ready to talk about football ! do you ilke football ?
2192,i am so ready to talk about football lol . i love it it ! do you like nfl or college more ?
2193,"i love any type of football ! associations football , know as soccer in some countries , , australian rules , rugby football ! but the good ol ' national football league , nfl , right be my favorite !"
2194,i ca n't believe there are so many different sports called football though . who is your favorite nfl team ?
2195,"witht 32 teams , it 's hard to pick ! who do you like ?"
2196,i 'm a vikings fan but i like watching the broncos since i live in colorado springs . can you believe there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
2197,"wow , just 11 minutes ? is that it ? i know the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in shoulders to track players moves . that 's a lot of work fo is 11 minutes of live play !"
2198,it masses the data analysts job very easy i 'm sure hah . espn even won an emmy for that yellow first down line !
2199,they sure are an innovative league ! did you know there is even a rocket scientist coaching in the nfl ? !
2200,is n't that matt patricia ?
2201,"it is ! he was an aeronautical engineer before coaching in teh dc l ! his school , rpi , even had the words ' sin ' , ' cosine ' , and ' tangent ' in their fights hong !"
2202,oh wow ! i 'm not smart enough to even go to those football games ! t would be interesting t see that 2220 footbal game in 1916 though !
2203,"yeah ! i do like he entertainment thought . you know , we talked about fight songs a minute ago ; did you know tht snoop dogg wrote af it song for his son 's high school football game ! ?"
2204,i bet that bumped top the billboard charts after being written huh ? lol that is funny !
2205,"i thought so too ! you know , even high school football is really popular . there is ah is school football stadium in allen , texas witht 18 , 000 seats !"
2206,"did n't it costa 0 million dollars ? that is insane , i beg the teachers are skill underpaid there too !"
2207,"yup ! that 's th on ! so much on is spent on football ! did you know that those humongous american flags at football stadiums cost 50 , 000 to make ! ?"
2208,"it is cool to see bu tthat is a lot of money ! i hope it goes to a good cause ! anyways , grea chat have an awesome day !"
2209,"indeed ! and those flags webs 1 , 100 pounds ! go bi gore o home , a s they way ! good bye !"
2210,that right ! take care !
2211,do you like to too about football ?
2212,"hi , yes , sports i general ! ! and of course about football !"
2213,nice ! th university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink ! lol
2214,hahaha tht is pretty funny and not intimidating at lab !
2215,i know . in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars !
2216,wow that shocked me . . . nothing like that today did you know thee football coaches are the highest paid employees of the us defense department !
2217,that 's incredible ! the highest score ever in a football game is when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 !
2218,wow wat a score ! ! did you know there is a fight song from a school written by snoop og !
2219,i did n't . tat ' sweat ! espn for an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line on tv .
2220,"i think that is cool ! technology has allowed for a way more exciting game , like hte tracking chips !"
2221,i agree ! baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career .
2222,"wow , i wouldnt and a change like that . . did you kow there re many other types of football like soccer , rugby gaelic football ! !"
2223,yes i 've seen them . i had af friend what was i rugby club years and years ago .
2224,"cool i love soccer r , follow the fc barcelona . . . but do not know anything about australian football !"
2225,thats funny . what same friend was from england and was big on manchester united . the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay . seems crazy to pay all that money for a ticket when looked at from that perspective .
2226,"seems like it but the reality is thati he he show if worth it and with the tracking chip you get info like the ball speed , the velocity and that adds to the average 11 minute hahaha"
2227,lol the average lifetime earnings of an engineer i higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl layer and an average mlb player .
2228,oh wow . but i think is way more fun to play football . . . but i think the engineer has to work many more years . . have you seen the super super big flags at the football stadiums
2229,i have seen them ! hose lags are huge !
2230,"they weight more that 1000 pounds and cost about 50 , 000 wow q"
2231,holy smokes ! i had no idea they rigged and costa hat much . thanks for chatting !
2232,hi . do you watch football at all these days ?
2233,"yes i stil , hatch the nfl of another season is over . it was an exciting 17 weeks . you ?"
2234,"i do watch the nfl and i do agree with you it was an exciting season and especialy , y when my new england patriots won the super bowl ! ! !"
2235,oh congratulations . another prone under your guys belt . speaking of the playoffs the first nfl playoff game was played i 1932 !
2236,i did n't know this . do you recall by any chance what were the teams palying that gram eat that year ?

2239,"yes and the field was same to the chicago blackhawks at the time . no , what that the highest score ever ?"

2242,that okay . it was a game between georgia tech crushed cumberland 220 i 1916 .
2243,holy cow how doest hate an happen ? i bet matt patricia would never let that happen . he is the only rocket scientist coaching in the nfl .
2244,yes i heard that matt patricia is a rocket scientist aw time back in my local news and when he was our defensive coordinator under bill belichick .
2245,"oh wow . he graduated from a school whose fight song includes sin , cosine , and tangent lol ."
2246,i did n't know this . that is very interesting . matt patricia is a really smart guy and i think he will be great as a lions head coach .
2247,"yes i agree with you . do you like watching high school football ? it is huge in tend , they have a stadium that cost 60 million to build ."
2248,i do n't really watch high school football these day but that is sa lot of money to buy a high school stadium .
2249,"yes it is ; it seats 18 , 000 people ."
2250,nice . did you know that alex smith received his bachelor 's degree in just a couple of years ?
2251,"that is amazing he sounds so smart . speaking of quarterback s , russel wilson ncis stil ; turner a maqjorleague baseball contract . it was nice speaking with you today ."
2252,i did n't know this bout russel wilson . it was fantastic chatting with you today as well . i hope you have a great day ! ! !
2253,you too ! have a good one !
2254,"i do n't know much about football , but apparently adrian peterson job a new star won the redskins team ;"
2255,"he seems to have done well , let smith struggled in that game . i is typically on ; link , to that i know ,"
2256,"i 's petty amazing how he got a shot , seeing as he was n't in the training camp , it sounds like he has a lot o stamina ."
2257,he is ready and willing to do that ever gruden will give him . definitely a hard worker .
2258,"i think nfl players as a lot of money these days , so i bet he 's glad to be on a team gain . however , i did n't know that bowlers in 1960 made more than football star s ."
2259,"that is kind crazy , i wonder how much taht pay was , and what the gap is today ."
2260,"it 's probably not s much as it was in 1960 twice as much , wow . that makes me want to take up bowling ! i think the game peterson played was n't a very clear win , only a few states . the was one game in 1916 where the final score was 2220 . i did n't know the game would go that high !"
2261,"neither did i . that is a pretty large ap . in most games there is only 11 minutes of live game play anyway , that game must have had a lot of e ."
2262,"yeah . id didnt ' realize it was only around 11 minutes of actual play . thinking about it , though , i guess they time all the huddles adn positioning . i did n't know teh circular huddle eas created by a deaf quarterback . i thought that began with the can so they could all hear each other ."
2263,"it is amazing that what they come up with , the huddle has become iconic ."
2264,yes it has become comic . hi peterson is called a running back . is that the guy who tries to throw it to the quarterback or tries to catch the ball ?
2265,he is the guy that the quarterback hands the ball off to .
2266,"oh ok . i knew the quarterback was an important guy for offense , but peterson 's position sounded important too . i think football player have a lot of pressure to o well . apparently the nfl uses chips to track lots of stats about tend . i wonder if that affects their pay ."
2267,"im not sure , but i know they do use the data from the chips o make play safer for them and make their pads better ."
2268,that 's a good thing . i think tey can easily get injured without pads . i think padding is mores ike teh american kind off footbal . i 've seen some clips of rugby played without pads . that looks pretty rough .
2269,"yeah , gaelic football is the same way , im not sure how it works but it isnt for the weak ."
2270,"i personally like the european type of football , also called soccer . i like the strategy and skill . iv ' e been to a international soccer game before , it was really awesome to watch h ."
2271,me too . i always played growing up . i loved watching the world cup this past summer .
2272,"i safe n't watched sports lately . it 's funny how things change , like how tom brady became a super bowl champ , but in high school they didnt ' even give him a chance ."
2273,"i know , i et they feel a little stupid now seeing what he ha become ."
2274,"yes i think so . i wonder if peterson wants to win such an award before he has to retire . hopefully the redskins will do better than the game against the broncos , so he has a chance to prove himself ."
2275,"i knows e has become a more dominant force ash e gains experience . anyway , nice chat ! have a good night ."
2276,i was just reading about the nfl . are you a football fan ?
2277,"i love football , go detroit lions ! ! hat about you ?"
2278,"i am a vikings fan , big time . i was reading abou nick foles ' up and down career . the eagles sure killed my vices n type playoffs last year !"
2279,"it will be interesting to see how foles does from here on out , must be irritating for eagles fans never knowing !"
2280,"yes . i was surprised that the patriots lost the super bowl last year . did you know that when tb was a fan in high school as a backup , they never played him on the jv team when they were having a really bad season . funny !"
2281,"that is funny , i do n't care for patriots but ca n't help but like brady , a michigan man go blue ! !"
2282,exactly . you can not fault his tremendous commitment to the am . i think a bus o patriots superbowl would be fun again .
2283,"i 've read that snoop dogg wrote a fight song fo hs son 's football team in high school , that could be interesting !"
2284,yes . that is probably a pretty vivid and inspiring song !
2285,i was also interested to read about the lions ' coach is a rocket scientist ! have you seen him during a game ? s o dough looking
2286,"matt patricia ? he is super smart ! do is alex smith , one of my favorite qb 's . he got a bachelor 's degree in 2 years in a master 's soon after ."
2287,"that is good ti hear , some of those nfl players do n't seem too intelligent , and can be so cocky and"
2288,"i agree . here 's a piece of football trivia . the huddle was created because of a deaf 2b , so that the other team could not read his hand signals . interesting . . ."
2289,oh how cool is that ! also interesting i stat teh embed chip in the sound fads to track the players every move
2290,i had heard that somewhere . plus all of the wonderful new technology in the helmets to help with the concussion problem .
2291,yes that i sa scary thing !
2292,"seems to be being worse , despite the tech advances . players musk the stronger , bigger and faster ?"
2293,"definitely , so many people can be so competitive it gets scary ."
2294,yes . hey do you know th highest score ever in a football game ? you 'll never guess !
2295,"i have no idea , but would guests maybe 77 ?"
2296,"good try ! in 1916 , it was 220 . georgia tech defeated cumberland . wow !"
2297,"holy so that is a huge score , nad number ; and didn ' steven make air on the board !"
2298,awful ! it was great chatting with you . thanks . go lions and bikes !
2299,are you a football fan ? do you have a favorite team ?
2300,i like the steelers . how bout you .
2301,i 'm a steelers fan too ! i ; liver right on the ohio or pa line . did you know that there is only 1 left handed qb in the fl relaly moore .
2302,i did know that . you would think there woud be ore .
2303,i know . what do you thin koi th nfl sing tracking chips in the players shoulders and in the footballs ?
2304,i think its an amazing technology . the things they can do these days .
2305,i know . i just wonder though what exactly those chips do . liek . . . could they read where other chainsaw re on the field ? . . and if so . . . you ; in a chip in the shoulder pad to a wide receiver be programmed to the chip that 's in the football making the football come to the receiver 's chip location ?
2306,tat 's interesting to think about . i bet believe nasa already checked into that .
2307,hahaha an average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay . crazy the they make it stretch out to over 3 hours .
2308,i know right . they get all that money for 11 minutes worth of entertainment .
2309,it pays to be an engineer as theur lifetime earnings are higher than that of the lifetime earnings of an average nfl or mlb player r .
2310,yeah but i think it would be a lot more fun to play football for a living .
2311,i 'm with you there ! lol in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars .
2312,us think the players union has testified that situation .
2313,yes ! lol i wonder why the univerity of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink ? probably to mess with the team . lol
2314,to mess with the visiting team . do you think it worked .
2315,i do n't think so . lol how about the highest scoring game ever when georgia tech beat cumberland in 1916 by a score of 2220 !
2316,thy her genus rubbing i in that last 200 points huh .
2317,lo poor cumberland . did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf qb so the other team could n't steal his han signals ?
2318,yeah and the huddle has become so ingrained into footbal . its hard to think of the game without it .
2319,i know right ? but was fun chatting it you !
2320,you . do you like the nfl nad the ravens ?
2321,i like the nfl . not so much the ravens .
2322,"same here . i guess lamar jackson is back , or ha seen back , . . . so many injuries in the nfl ."
2323,im a steelers fan and we play three twice a year . i promise you im not worried about lamar jackson .
2324,ha . i see . . . i 'm a chiefs far nd i 'm not losing any sleepy . i think the ravens would do better if they could the players out of jail . i did n't know teh saints ha dan did record .
2325,jackson can run hurt he cant throw at all . you all got a pretty good qb up ther in kc tho
2326,"yeah , mahomes is a great surprise . if he stays healthy , he 'll give brady a run for his money , career statswise ."
2327,brady will b out in the next few years . i would say staying healthy an knot falling off like a lot of guys do after one good year is his main concern s .
2328,"yes , i agree . . . maybe he ' , l be like luck and avoid those sacks . he so , i 'd hate to see him go and he 's so young ."
2329,tomb e honest the chiefs scare me more than the patriots do a this poiting .
2330,"yeah , i was surprise to see that rams come out on top . i think the pats are going downhill ."
2331,i sure hope so . im sick of them . lo ? did you know tht there is a rocket scientist coaching in teh nfl .
2332,i did not . is he doing well ? i ca n't believe taht or that there is only 11 average minutes of gameplay in an nfl game .
2333,his name eis mat patricia . im not lure the he coaches .
2334,i 'm not sure those are transferable talents . . . nor do i thin painting a visitors locker rom pink is going to do anything at the u . of iowa .
2335,yeh i dont see that doing much . it would make a and team laugh and who cares what it does to a bad team . lol .
2336,i played in hs and on away games we used the gills locker rooms . it had no effect although i did break a barry manilow album after a loss . i regret that . . . we did have a circular huddle thank to a deaf qb of yesteryear .
2337,that huddle ha grown into a major part of the game .
2338,yeah . . . i do n't remember alex smith being so smart or being a 1st round draft pick . . .
2339,i think he was drafted by the patriots wasting e . i didnt think ye was a first rounders either .
2340,this article i read says joke was a first rounders in 2005 does n't say to whom . thanks for the chat and good luck ti the steelers .
2341,cause a good one .
2342,hello are you familiar with football ?
2343,yes m id o . i 'm a that new orlean saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player ; they have to leave if a player comes in to the same restaurant . it 's discrimination .
2344,i agree such old fashion rules are a shame . at least the nfl has no written rule against female players
2345,that ' z good . when do you think we will see female players ?
2346,"that i am not sure . even though an average game only has 11 minutes of real gameplay , football is still among the most dangerous parts so the requirements are quits up there ss well"
2347,"i think you are right . apparently , nfl uses tracking chips to keep track players ' every move on the field ."
2348,it must be for more data . it is hard to catch all the action in those few minutes . that why espn won an emmy for the yellow first down line because it helps digest teh information much easily
2349,i 'm sure coaches upset he data from these chips to maw various strategy in addition to watching video replays .
2350,i wonder if he nfl provides the data to individual coaches
2351,i do n't know . thank you for telling me that espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow first own line . it 's an interesting fact .
2352,"do you follow teams , posting , or players ?"
2353,i used to like 49ers since i lived in sf for 0 years but now i follow the patriots .
2354,i used to follow green ellis on the patriots since hes till has never fumbled in his entire career
2355,"it was amazing that ellis has never fumbled the football in hi snl career , how about brady ?"
2356,"well he is better known s an amazing quarterback , having won 4 superb owls . he probably sgt in a position to fumble balls , bur he sure can throw"
2357,do you know that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
2358,yes . it is definitely impressive since ewing left handed i more a disadvantage than advantage in football unlike in other sports
2359,do youth in brady is the best qb in the entire history of nfl ?
2360,"in his performance , despite not being given the chance in highschool , i think he probably is the best qb in history"
2361,you are probably right . no one ha won many superbowl championship like he did . 5 times ?
2362,"something like that . anyway , i enjoyed our pleasant chat ."
2363,do you watch football ?
2364,yes . i watch it all season long andre on have been watching the alliance league .
2365,i watch it too . did you know kellan moore is the only lefty ?
2366,i did n't know that . come to think of it i ca n't recall any lefties . flower patriots running back benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the bell once during his career . impressive .
2367,"interesting , was he the best running back then ?"
2368,i would say that would go to jim brown . espn won an emmy award of creating the superimposed first down line . nice .
2369,that is probably worth it . that line is super cool .
2370,i agree . int he 1960s top bowlers mad two times s musc has the top football stars of that era .
2371,"wow ! that is pretty cool , gives me hope then !"
2372,lol do you know that he highest score over was for a football game at the college level ?
2373,"no , what was it ?"
2374,2220 ! georgia tech beat cumberland in 1916 .
2375,wo w ! that is a lot . did you know that university of iowa paints their guest locker room pink ?
2376,ok that 's funny ! they must do thay to get in th e3hads of who they are playing .
2377,"i think so , but honestly you have to wonder if it just makes the other team angry ."
2378,i do n't think they probably really care . do you know who alex smith is ?
2379,"notre really , is he a football player ?"
2380,yes . he 's a qb . he was the first pick in the 2005 draft by the uber 's . what 's impressive about him is stab he graduated with a bachelor 's degree in 2 years !
2381,interesting . is he left headed too ?
2382,no . he 's a righty . i 'm surprised that there 's only 11 minutes of live gameplay per an average nfl game .
2383,"that figures , every time i watch a game it is people standing around on the sideline s ."
2384,"hell , do you know much about quarterbacks ?"
2385,"i do ! i know that kellan moore is the only , but handed qb in the nfl ."
2386,that 's interesting . what about vick ?
2387,"he 's retired . bt , heist coaching one of the teams in the new american alliacbne of football league . o youth ave a favorite qb ? mine is baker mayfield ."
2388,i did not know that . i would say mahomes i say favorite right no do i also like andy dalton .
2389,mahomes j stood nad i like dalton . eb curious to see what mahomes does next year . the if teams can adjust to him . baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career . yikes ! that sounds too risky .
2390,i agree . did you know alex smith took so many ap classes in high school that he was a junior when he entered college ?
2391,i did n't know that . that 's pretty impressive ! the circular huddle was related by a deaf qb named paul hubbard so the other team could not read hi hand signals .
2392,stats ' pretty interesting . i was no idea . do you like the nfl is general ?
2393,i do . i 've been an nfl fan my whole life . probably more so though before big money chatted the game .
2394,me too ; did you know the nfl has no written rule against females playing in the league ?
2395,i disk now hate . i wonder i one 'll see the soon . maybe a kicker ?
2396,i bet it ill be a kicker too .
2397,did you know that there is only 11 minutes of olive gameplay per game ?
2398,"i did not know that , but that is pretty amazing . i would have never guessed that ."
2399,short time considering they stretch out a rap to 3 hours . lol what do you think of the tracking chips they put in the players shoulder pads and footballs to track data ?
2400,"i agree . yes , i heard they do that to track rotation , ball speed , location , and velocity ."
2401,i 've wondered if they could be attracted to other chips ? like would the chips in the balls be programmed tho be attracted to hte chips in the wide receivers shoulder pads ?
2402,"'m not too sure how that works , but curious to know ."
2403,the highest scoring football game ever was 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland in 1916 . wat a blowout !
2404,it was good talking to you !
2405,"hi , do you like the nfl ?"
2406,it 's pretty entertaining . ? can you believe the very first playoff game was in 1932 ?
2407,that was a long time ago ! lp ike when georgia tech beat cumberland !
2408,"yeah k , on an 80yard long dirt field that was the home of an nhl team !"
2409,"wait , what ? that was the field ? the cumberland game ? tell me more !"
2410,the field of the first playoff game in 1932 was actually on a dirt field inside the chicago stadium which wasa here the blackhawks played their games at the tie .
2411,that 's crazy ! im in chicago and i did not know that ! i did love the old stadium though !
2412,nice . did you know there was a football coach in the nfl who is also literally a rocket scientist ?
2413,i did ! but i am also a huge football junkie . matt patricia ! he is the in head coach .
2414,that cool . the lions have a pretty good quarterback .
2415,"i agree . although he is long in the tooth . as a bears fan , i hope they do poorly !"
2416,i ca n't believe there is only one lefthanded quarterback in hte league .
2417,is it bran leftwich ?
2418,"no , it 's kellan moore ."
2419,"wow , i thought it was bron leftwich . eh was good too ! d o you have a favorite nfl team ?"
2420,"i do n't , i ' metre of a baseball fan . though russell wilson plays both !"
2421,i love baseball too . i am a cubs fan though . big fan . watching mb network now !
2422,"cool . yea h , wilson is technically still under an mlb contract even though he has n't played since 2011 ."
2423,he has been to a few spring training though . managers an yankees .
2424,"yeah , the rangers traded hi to the yankees last year ."
2425,nice chatting with you !
2426,"thou , too ! have a good den !"
2427,"hello , did you happen to watch the superbowl yesterday ?"
2428,ye si did . did you ?
2429,"i did , i thought it was a good game , both teams had strong defenses i think tom brady did a good job even though he finished as the third most valuable qb"
2430,both defenses did play good . who were the two qbs more valuable than tom brady ?
2431,im not sure but if had to gues i would say aaron rodgers and drew brees .
2432,i see . are you talking about the super bowl or teh entire season ?
2433,"im talking about the entire season , i think he might go up to second or first in his performance last tight l , he threw a great cafes for hte only touchdown"
2434,but there were not passing touch downs last night .
2435,"i kno w , but hte pass tha nwas almost a touchdown , taht the one im referring to ."
2436,i see . yes that was a very god pass . not many qbs could make that throw .
2437,"yeah , too bad it wasnt a touchdown though , so cool just a few more yards , so what is your favorite nfl team ?"
2438,the dallas cowboys . i 've been watching themes in i was a little in . how about you ?
2439,"my favorite team is the patriots so i had a pretty good time latest night , how did the cowboys do this season ?"
2440,that 's awesome . it 's always nice when your favorite team wins the championship . the cowboys won their division but lost in the 2nd round of he playoffs this year .
2441,"thats too bad , maybe next year they ill make it , you know the saints have thai unfair rule and if a cheerleader is a ta restaurant and a player goes to the same places he must then leave"
2442,really ? that 's a pretty crazy huh that i have never har you . did you also know that brad johnson is thye only qb toe very throw touchdown pass to himself ?
2443,"how is that possible lol , i might have to look for tha strange fact in youtube later , i wonder how the pass went"
2444,i gas near the goal line and when he threw the bal it was deflated by a lineman but went right back to him . h caught it and ran it in . was pretty crazy .
2445,"it must have been great and really sad since h eis the be one to have done that , i dont know were the fact of the 11 minutes of gameplay comes rom , it sure seems like a game is a lot longer and the clock is always packed ."
2446,yeah it would seem like a lot longer than 11 minute it me as well .
2447,"yeah , football sure is a beautifull game to bad the season is now over ."
2448,do you follow football much ?
2449,"hello there i do watch it , how about you ?"
2450,i love watching it . do you watch both college and nfl ? who are your teams ?
2451,"i follow the packers , how about you ?"
2452,"me too , i love aaron rodgers . i am am iowan hawkeye fan , did you ear that they paint their locker room for the other team pink"
2453,"i heard about that , that is too funny , and i guess it 's proven 5o help the other team relax ."
2454,"right , i think it has worked , htey have beat quality teams at home . did you know there is no rule against females playing in the league"
2455,"i think i heard that , i think it would be very cool tv see a female player make a roster and play ."
2456,"right , i heard there may be a female kicker going to play college football somewhere , that would , d be neat"
2457,"yeah its more would be , even if it was just kicker to start ."
2458,"for sure , that would open up a lot of opportunities . did you hear about the saints cheerleader rule ?"
2459,"i think so , the one where they put have to leave a place if members o 'the team show ?"
2460,"yea that is pretty sexist in my opinion . that makes the frame potential in the nfl take a step back , my opinion"
2461,"yeah i would have to agree with you there , seems dumb to me to be honest ."
2462,"for sure i agree , do you watch college"
2463,"yeah i watch some college but note very closely , always seems like the same schools , how about you ?"
2464,"some , just the hawkeyes mostly . did you har got the game in 1916 that ended 2220"
2465,i heard about that wow ! i wonder how many of the fans of the opposing team were still in the stnadsa t the end ?
2466,i wonder i the still had a football program softer that lol ! i would have quit once the score got to be like 1000
2467,"yeah they just cancel the whole program lol , and how did they even score that many ? you ca n't even score that much in tecmo super bowl ."
2468,"right will , that is so crazy . i feel there should be veep a mercy rule created after that game lol . it was very nice chatting it you !"
2469,"hi , i read somewhere that the average nfl game has only 11 minute sofa actual hame way , that 's hard to believe is n't it ?"
2470,"yes , anyone who has ever tuned into an nfl broadcast knows that plenty of air time is spent showing players huddling , coaches yelling , and fans cheering"
2471,"yeah , it seems like alot of wasted time ."
2472,i do not like that
2473,"ok , when do you think the nfl will get its first female player ?"
2474,i do not know that . it would be nice if it happened .
2475,"i do n't understand , but i would think they are people sitting around ad betting on the date the first woman player will be admitted to the nfl ."
2476,sorry i do not know that details .
2477,"ok , that 's fine . do you know taht thye university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink ?"
2478,"yes i think , college football . . . visiting locker rooms are often cramped places that are n't meant to b . for ah ome team 's opponents , bur the hawkeyes take things up a notch"
2479,i 'd say so too . do you know nfl players have tracking chips embedded int heir shoulder pads to record their every move on the field ?
2480,"yes i know little bit , we 7 , 2017 last season , zebra technologies brought eaten stats to the nfl by implementing their reid chips in nfl players ' pads to track speed ,"
2481,"that 's cool , i wonder who 's the fastest player ?"
2482,"i think , ten running backs were faster , and wide receiver john ross set the combine record at 4 . 22 . but it 's burnette , the 240pound cruises"
2483,does burnette play for the jacksonville jaguars ?
2484,sorry i don ' know that details please explain .
2485,a as just wondering what only team he played for . what is your favorite football team ?
2486,"i like , the green bay packers are a professional american footbal team based in green bay , wisconsin ."
2487,"oh cool , but packers are good . i like the dallas cowboys , america 's team ."
2488,"okay , that nice . what player you mostly like ?"
2489,i like the rest tom brady . it 's been nice talking with you .
2490,"hello , do you know much about the quarterback position ?"
2491,"i do ! i know that the nfl now has one left handed quarterback now , do you ? ;"
2492,that 's interesting . i did not know that . i know vick was a lefty .
2493,and the great steve young haha . can you believe bowlers once earned more money than footbal players ?
2494,i find that hard to believed . bowling has really gone downhill since then .
2495,"it really has , or has football gone up ?"
2496,maybe just football has gone up . back mayfield once thought about quitting football to pursue a career in profesional gaming .
2497,"i wonde in he is still great at halo 3 ? i 'm surprised alex smith is still playing , given he 's basically a genius !"
2498,i have no idea if he is . that 's pretty amazing about alex smith . he must be very smart .
2499,"oh for sure . i love watching football games , but hate that ther eis only 11 minutes of actual live gamer , ay ."
2500,that ; s very surprising . did you no wthe nfl has no written rule against women laying ?
2501,"i did n't know taht , i wonder if any have tried out for teams ! i hate that the new orleans saints kick cheerleaders out of restaurants if a player comes in though !"
2502,i thinkk any teams shave rules about players interacting with cheerleaders .
2503,maybe it is needed f the players ? could you imagine being at that college game where the score was 2220 ?
2504,i ca n't imagine losing by that much . i would be very sa d .
2505,i think the whole pay would just quit after that haha . that was in 1916 though . it might have gotten better !
2506,iowa painted their opposing team locker room pink .
2507,"i thought that was always interesting , i wonder if it actually did affect either teams ?"
2508,not too sure . i do ' r see how that would really work all that well .
2509,maybe they should get an emmy like espn did for their yellow line during gameplay ?
2510,"that ' z pretty awesome . well , it was really good chatting with you today ."
2511,do you know that twice stand for ?
2512,i have no idea is in americans football champions ?
2513,i think so . it makes sense .
2514,"hahahaaaa , ok thats awesome i hope so too , w . is it called footballs always ? they play it with their hands . i dont get it some times ."
2515,"yes , football should be a soccer games since soccer players play using their feet ."
2516,"you got that right lol , i feel the sam way too , i love soccer , and i love watching the players real in american football though , so talented di jist hope no one dies in the field one day they are talented and strong though , did you know that kellan one is the only left handed qb in the nfl ? i guess right headed people are just more fit to be as ."
2517,i did not know that . are you watching footbal games this season ?
2518,"o in particular i am forced to follow them tough because of my job , i love talking about sorta with my clients"
2519,people walk abou esports during business conversations but we need to avoid talking about politics . how do teams choose quarterbacks ? is it like choosing leader in a company ?
2520,"exactly i agree with you , wat esports everything is into play though including race , i dont know how they choose the qb , but i know a few that only 2 black qbs have won the super bowl"
2521,"thanks for the info . by the way , since we talked about i earlier , afc stands for african fooball conference , i just did seem research while talking to you ."
2522,"ohhh lol we were not so off then it close to american football conference , they have come from far though l , for example i read somewhere thati he first nfl play off a was played on a dirt field in chicago , but now look how fancy the fields ar to much money lol , do you think players are overpaid ?"
2523,i just found out that in consists of nfc and afc
2524,"ohhh wow , now i know what nfl and afc are so what is nfc then ?"
2525,nc stands for national football cofnernce .
2526,"wow to complicate , i know those tear nl id one o 'the 4 major pro sports leagues in north america . i think thats pretty also , and one thing i like is that they play football here in america and dig makes anough money to get teh robert kerqfts rich literally the nfl does not have to tell the sport anywhere else if it does not want to ."
2527,nfl owners make so much money i do not mind if the players are overpaid because they are doing dangerous jobs . do you know that there is no rule against female players ?
2528,"i ear you my friend they page so much knew if they can pay the athletes that much , lol how much do you think they keep ? ? wait what do you mean no duel against female players ? you mean nthe can play on a real team ?"
2529,as long as they meet eligibility requirements .
2530,"ohhh wow ! those guys are giants literally , but surprisingly young too , tom brady is getting too old for the i think that she patriots are not doing very good this year , do you believe women should play on an nfl team ?"
2531,i agree . nice chatting with yu .
2532,car you a fan o fake nfl ?
2533,"yes , i am a big pacers fan !"
2534,"niche ! i like the packers also , i like aaron rodgers . do you like the saints at all ?"
2535,"no way , hate them . what about demarcux lawrence not getting the praise like he should ? he is a great pass usher !"
2536,"i heard that , i think he wil get test big contract though . did you know the saints cheerleaders need to leave a restaurant if the p ; payers come , kind of sexist i think !"
2537,"yeah , that would suck to be them . teh cheerleaders already do n't get paid . i would be so embarrassed ."
2538,"for sure , you know who does get paid well , engineers . they make more than nfl players over their lifetime"
2539,"ethan tc thats crazy and those quarterback better stab in school and not rely on their bodies . alex smith is very smart , ya know ?"
2540,i hear that and a great player . didn ' the get his degree super early ?
2541,yeah and did it right . he can play and get degrees ! did you know the huddle was created by a deaf man ?
2542,"i think i heard that ! wasnt it paul hubbard d , he was so good or the browns !"
2543,"exactly , he did n't want anyone o see his hand signals . that is so cool ."
2544,for sure ! are you a college football fan at all ?
2545,"yes , and mayfield is my guy ! he is from ou and we would go watch him play all the time . ya know he was n't gon na go for football once to his life ?"
2546,"nice . i heard eh at a gamer for halo 3 . i could have beat him . i am am ios fan , they paint the locker rooms of the visitors pink !"
2547,"ha , nice ! i like confidence ! yeah mayfield was donna go become a gaming pr because nobody could beat him , according to him . yes a pink room woulda e embarrassing and deflating for the other team . ."
2548,shoe plays halo 3 anymore lol . i was playing that like 15 years ago . i think the pink calms the other can too much
2549,"oh , that is an interesting outlook . i think i agree . lol ya know th highest scoring game occured in 1o1yw hen georgia tec defeated cumberland 2220 . can you believe that ?"
2550,man i would have quit when the game got to 1000 . so embarrassing . good casting with you !
2551,thank you for the new perspective ! go gon na run with it
2552,"me too , by !"
2553,hello . how are you .
2554,"jim great , are you a football fan ?"
2555,yeah . what do you think about volta burfict .
2556,"i think that was a low shot , hitting antonio brown like that , what are your thoughts ?"
2557,i thought it was really low . he does it all the time metoo only good part was that it cost his team the game . .
2558,"it did , i bet hs teammates were upset because of this , it was late it he game so yah , serious consequences"
2559,yeah . i dont like hat dude .
2560,"thats not sport friendly , there is no flap gon the play i dont think a suspension is a key thing the steelers won 2022"
2561,so what do you think will there ever be a ocean in the nfl
2562,"i but think so , heres no rule against that but i think its unlikely , what do you think ?"
2563,"maybe a kicker , but i doubt it ."
2564,yeah i think i'ts unlikely .
2565,"just think the first time a wo , an got seriously hurt . it would not go over to well in the media ."
2566,want do you think about the 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
2567,i trink the game shouldnt last 3 hours with only 11 minute so gameplay .
2568,"i hae the same thoughts , seems like an insult for fans nad for viewers , too many adds , too many interruption"
2569,yeah . i can understand the super bowl taking longer but not regular season games .
2570,"i agree , it does take a long time , the nfl has tracking chips"
2571,i know they have them in the players shoulder pads as well as in the footballs .
2572,"yeah the chips in the footballs allows us to tell track , velocity , rotation , ball speed"
2573,its such a good invention . we get a bunch of new stars from it .
2574,"ia great a lot of interesting stats , tech is taking over sports ,"
2575,well have a good one . i got get off here .
2576,hello . have you ever heard of baker mayfield ?
2577,kids i have ! did you knoe he actually came close to quitting football in order to pursue a competitive gaming career ? g a he did n't as i would guess football is musc more lucrative !
2578,i did hear that adn i 'm glad he did n't too ! it surprises me thoug in a way to picture him going so good st video games . in another way i 'm not because he is very competitive .
2579,that is true . ut you kknow what really surprises me ? i ca n't believe there 's only one left handed qb in the nfl and that 's kellan moore . i figured there 'd be far more left handers !
2580,i 've never actually noticed but it just seems like there should be . be there will be more quartebracksl ike patrick mahomes . i think he an throw with either has s .
2581,maybe so ! i wonder if the deaf guy named paul . d . hubbard who created the circular huddle used today for keep opposing texas from reading his hand bengals was left funded ?
2582,i do n't know . i think it 's neat that the used to ge a deaf quarterback and i wonde why tenure 's none in current times . the huddle ios a smart way to protect him conversation though !
2583,"indeed it is . since we 're on the subject of quarterbacks , to you like tom brady ? i bet his old jv high teams till kicks themselves to this day for refusing to start him hen he was a backup despite never winning a game or scoring a touchdown that season . it 's kind of sad , really ."
2584,oh wow ! i bet they do too ! that coach may not even coach anymore after realizing what a mistake he made . i wonder why he just would n't give the backup a chance when clearly the starter was not doing so good .
2585,"it 's a mystery , isnt it . but coaches sometimes make back decisions . i tell you what i often wonder is why we have n't had a female player drafted yet . females are allowed to play as long s they meet the eligibility requirements , believe it or not !"
2586,"i guess they have n't tried or been all to meet requirements . i 've seen a few female players , mostly kickers , on the news and other shows . i know there is a female do and i think na assistant coach of seem kind now ."
2587,"is there really ? i mean , since the average game is only 11 minutes in terms of live gameplay , you 'd think we would have at least seen a female kicker by now , right ?"
2588,th nfl is slow moving o some things . just look skate the new orleans saints . they have a real for the cheerleaders that if they are at a restaurant and a p ; layer comes in they have to leave .
2589,"that is hard to believe and i ca n't believe lawsuits have n't been filed yet unless sit 's just some silly voodoo superstition or something ? either way , in terms of money , women would be better off becoming engineers since they make more than the average lifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players anyway ."
2590,"wow , that really surprises m . i mean , some of the contracts players get are so extreme !"
2591,"hey , even crazier , uk in the 1960s , th stop bowlers made more than the top football players . that is so depressing considering how rough football is compared to how easy bowling is ."
2592,i guess people were n't that into football back tried like they are not . nw espn wins an emmy for creating a yellow line to show where th first down is during the game .
2593,that is true and that yellow line is so innovative . i could n't wathc a game without it today ! but thankfully people the more into football today as i could n't even a bowled reading more than benjarvus greenellis who 's never tumbled the football in his entire pro career . that would be paid wrong !
2594,that would be wrong and i like hat line too . it makes the game more intense and exciting when you know just how far a team has to go . do you watch any college football games ?
2595,i do like to watch college football . but i feel sorry for those teams who play iowa at their stadium and have to sit in a pink lockerroom . i 'm not sure if that 's good or bad for the university of iowa . ah ! what about you ?
2596,"i love college football ! i think it 's better than the nfl actually . have you ever heard about the georgia tech or cumberland game of 1916 ? if not , heck it out when you have time . i 've got to go . it 's been great chatting with you !"
2597,do you know the details of quarterback ?
2598,you megan the position in football ? i know a little
2599,quarterback is one of the most important position in the national football league .
2600,"te qb certainly has a challenging role , the game has evolved around the position ."
2601,"yes , its u . do you like football ?"
2602,"i wathc hit from time to time . i 'm surprised to earn that tom brady as overlooked by his jv team , in high school ."
2603,"junior varsity players are the members of a team who are not the way player in a competition , usually at the high school and college levels in the united states ."
2604,i would have expected the coach to recognize talent in the qb taht would eventually sign 4 super bowls . have you heard of the smith ?
2605,it think alexander douglas smith is an american football quarterback for the washinton redskins of the national football league . is it right ?
2606,i think so . he took a lot of ap tests in high school and started college eas a junior . smart guy .
2607,"okay , that 's nice ."
2608,"if he does n't do wel in the nl , i bet he could become an engineer . they can more on average over their careers ."
2609,"okay , last offseason the redskins traded for alex smith , hoping he would fill that hope fot several years . but when he suffered the compound spiral stature of his right leg in november , it left his career in doubt and the redskins needing to plan for life without him . the redskins have made it clear that smith 's health , regardless of football , is most important ."
2610,it 's good to hear that the team is concerned . i think hat he needs to consider other alternatives besides football .
2611,what is your favorite team in national football league ?
2612,probably the green gay packers . they are the only nonprofit team in the league . they are worth a ton of money .
2613,"i like too . the green bay pacers re a professional american football team based in green bay , wisconsin ."
2614,they have sold out every game since 1960 .
2615,the packers compete in the national football league as a member club of the league 's national football conference north division .
2616,"the players make a lot of money , but an average game has about 11 minutes of live gameplay !"
2617,"yes , and i think is is one of the most famous game in the world ."
2618,it you know that engineers tend to make more over their lifetimes than nfl players ? i guess it 's better to be an engineer .
2619,"hi , how are you ?"
2620,im great . how are you ? are you a football person ?
2621,"i 'm good , thanks for asking . yes , i like football ."
2622,8 it n't watch too often . i usually follow the nfl right around playoff . did you watch the super bowl this year ?
2623,"yes , i watched my favorite team , the patriots pull out another win with my man , tom brady ."
2624,th patriots seem to always win . werent they called the lannisters of the nfl ?
2625,"yes , they 've been csaleld that . hey do n't hate , appreciate ! lol"
2626,"lol . ok . i guess i usually , y roots or the underdog . didnt the pats win last year too ?"
2627,they 've won a fe times the past couple of years .
2628,"um , doesnt brady have lol a dozen rings or something ? of a dozen ?"
2629,"yeah , but he deserves every one soft hem , he has a very good work ethic ."
2630,"yes , he also seems to have a unique diet . strawberryless ."
2631,"do n't forget the avocado icecream , he loves so much !"
2632,who avocado ? are they a vegan thing ? he is a vegan right ? is his wife ?
2633,"i 'm not sure about that icecream , it 's supposed to be ready with all the good fats , but it sounds just plain gross . i ai n't eating it !"
2634,i guess he sees the results and doesnt mind the taste . maybe you add salt or something ? salsa ? i wonder .
2635,uggs ! you 're making it worse !
2636,lol . sorry . i got carried away . i guess i should control myself during 'the chats or i might disgust my partner . sorry .
2637,"lol , he can eat whatever he wants as long as i can eat my chicken wings adn drink mlb peer whirl watching him play . i sat for over 3 hours watching that last osu ; superbowl an about ran out of year before the end ."
2638,you lifted with tragedy there my friend . you need to be better prepared q does amazon do someday delivery of beer on sundays ? plan for success !
2639,"i was a little mad , especially when i keep hearing that theresa re only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay in a game . wtf ?"
2640,"yeah , a lot o standing around and waiting waiting waiting . anyway , great chat !"
2641,same to you ! have a good evening .
2642,"hello , do you watch football"
2643,"yup . i assume you are referring to american footbal , liken her nfl , an not to the world cup football ?"
2644,"yeah hte nfl ? i missed the superbowl this you , did you watch it ?"
2645,sup . brady did it again ! to think he was n't even a starter in high school . . .
2646,"i know , they missed on a real talent back then for sure"
2647,"another patriot i admire , former running back benjarvus greenellis . . . the dude never pence dumb , ed during his entire pro career !"
2648,ho amazing is that really . do you know what the highest score in football history is ?
2649,2220 ! talk about shooting am an 's horse !
2650,i know that is quite something . georgia tech must be still craving about that
2651,cumberland was scarred for all time ! i bet their players will switched to bowling . . .
2652,hahaha coul ; d be . back in the day the would have made much more money
2653,"true . you know what they say , guys do for the girls , teh gold , or the glory ! you know , the nfl has no rules against female players ? so the first could go for the gold and the glory too !"
2654,"ifr all wonder if we will see that anytime soon . i would like to see it , it might make the and more diverse and fun"
2655,yeah . did you know the big of iowa painted their visitor locker room pins '
2656,yeah that is so strange . did you know the espn won an emmy once ?
2657,of course ! they made that gamehcanging superimposable yellow line that tells every armchair quarterback where the first down marker is located . only noteworthy thing espn has ever done .
2658,"j guess , interesting to win an award for that . good for them . did you know baker mayfield considered quitting the sport ?"
2659,no ! tell m it is n't so ! why ? wash e jealous of alex smith 's stellar academic performance ?
2660,hahhaha maybe and also because he wanted to become a professional competitive gamer
2661,"well , he is still just one concussion away from a career as a couch potato , so maybe he should think his decision . . . alex smith , what of so many ap courses in high school , he started college as a junior , and yet he still chose a sport where men twice your size try to kill you every sunday . think again alex . . ."
2662,hhaha i know but what a dedication on his behalf go pam that ahead for your career . nice chatting with you
2663,are you a fan of the nfl 's cincinnati 's bengals ?
2664,"no , i do n't follow much the nfl , art htey doing good this year ?"
2665,i do n't know . i do know that the bengals ahve a linebacker in trouble for late hits . his name is von5aze burfict .
2666,"now i remember , i think there getting a lot of penalties these day , do n't they ?"
2667,i guess . i did n't even know the steelers had a problem with burfict . he sounds like kind of a dirty player .
2668,do you think all the chips and sensors they put in the players ' equipment will do anything regarding this issue ?
2669,i 'm not sure but i could see where it might help officiating the game . i think it could help qb safety .
2670,"ut is a rough sport , i hope they will enforce the rules and increase the safety of the players ."
2671,"yeah , some of them get brain damage . i guess with all the bad hits from burflict , the guy he hit ended up making the ganwwinninf touchdown ."
2672,do you think they have the same problems with the others variation o football like rub or canadian football ?
2673,"probably anything that 's a contact sport . it 's bad in boxing too . . . then again , th average length off real gameplay in the nfl is only 11 minutes ."
2674,ike new there wa sa lot of advertisements and replays but not that much . do you think they would do sorting about that ?
2675,i played in hs and there is a lot of standing around . most of it 's moving the poles is institutions . they could reduce commercials though .
2676,"yes , but it seems that it is still very popular 14 of the biggest stadium are football stadiums in the us , people seem to like it the way it is ."
2677,"yeah i prefer college football . my alma mater beat cumberland 2220 in 1916 . wow , the coach must of have wa vendetta . . ."
2678,"yeah , i would you feel if you were on the winning tea m ?"
2679,it think i our feel like a bully . we did use circular huddles but i did n't know it was invented for a deaf qb .
2680,they would not have need one for the play of th eb who threw a touchdown pass to himself .
2681,i would have liked seeing that . did you know that nfl has no rule against women playing ?
2682,"no , i did not know that , d o you think they want women players or they do n't want to offend feminists ?"
2683,"probably just never thought it would come up . in today 's ' victim ' society , they are probably keeping it that way for feminists . thanks ! you were great ."
2684,"you too , have a good weekend ."
2685,hello . do you watch football ?
2686,"yes , what is your favorite team ?"
2687,"i do n't real ; lot have a favorite . i like a few on bough sides , the nfc and the afc . what 's your favorite ?"
2688,"i like the giants , eli manning is struggling , but i believe that he will come back ."
2689,"day , a lot of people say it 's all on eli both i think it 's a team thing . their offense , not just im , has had trouble performing lately ."
2690,"he did improve , he made changes in his personal life , but ther results are do there . . . ."
2691,"what kind of changes di she make ? when they played eh saints he mad 31 of his 41 passes but they still lot the game , that just te ; . , e there 's problems with other players ."
2692,"he was benched in 2011 , so maybe he had issues with his coach ."
2693,"yeah , i remember that . i wonder if part of the issue is his age . he is 37 now ."
2694,"yeah , he has to get better if he wants toe was his career on a high note , like wen georgia tech won 2220 ."
2695,true . is that that game from back in the early 1900s ?
2696,"yeah , it was a long long time ago , against cumberland . how would you feel if you were on the losing team ?"
2697,"if i were cumberland i woudl feel terrible , memorialized . then again , maybe people just really didn ; t area ll that much about football back then . in the 60s bowlers made twice as much as football players ."
2698,"i thunk i would just laugh it off , there is nothing to learn from a 222 point defeat ."
2699,you can learn that your defense needs a great deal of work as well as the coaches because whatever game plant he coaches came up with clearly did not work .
2700,"yeah , do you like watching football on tv ?"
2701,"i do . hey , do you think cumberland should have painted their locker rooms pink like the university of iowa does ?"
2702,"maybe , it would not haven when worse . do you think there is too much advertisement in football , the is only 11 minutes of ive game play in a game ."
2703,yes i do . it seems like they go to commercial after every down practically . what do yu stinky bout women becoming players ?
2704,"i thick it is a good idea , but is it feasible , they they have the physical strength to compete with men ?"
2705,i dont ' know . j know there 's no rule against them playing if they ca meet requirements .
2706,do you like the nfl ?
2707,yes i do . do you know that kellan moore is the only left handed qb ?
2708,wow cool . do you like brady at be patriots ?
2709,"now i do , he is a good player , is he your favorite ?"
2710,one of them yes . in high scool he was a back up qb and never got started
2711,wow their loss i guess . brad johnson once threw himself a touchdown shirt
2712,wait what ? how is that even possible ?
2713,"exactly , that is why he is the only guy in history to ave done that"
2714,yeah i guess so . alex smith finished college in two years only
2715,"nice , he must be smart . did you know russell wilson is still under contract though he is not playing regularly ?"
2716,wow that is interesting . yes alex was smart but he also too lots of ap test sin high school and managed to move fast
2717,great planned too . snoop dog once route a son or his son 's team
2718,nice . u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
2719,i wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on the players
2720,i wonder the . in the 60s bowlers made more than the football players
2721,i guess football was not that popular back in ts day as bowling was
2722,true . do yu know the highest score in college football is 2220 ?
2723,"wow he , when was that and ho was playing ?"
2724,yes it was georgia tech who beat cumberland on 1926
2725,wow what a defeat . nice chat
2726,"same here , have a great one"
2727,hello did you know the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink ?
2728,hi ! is it the opposing players locker room taht 's painted pink or the players locker room ? why would they paint it pink ?
2729,it 's the opposing players locker room . it 's probably a psychological thing .
2730,"wonder if there 's an actual effect or they just want to get n their minds . i have never followed canadian football , i would imagine hockey is considered america 's favorites port instead of football . do n't think hockey is quite a bit as it is in canada ?"
2731,i think hockey is definitely bigger in canada . i think football nd baskeball are bigger in america than hockey .
2732,"even basketball too especially for march madness ! maybe canada have women playing in their football leagues because there 's no official written rule prevention female players of playing , but no one ha set met the physical requirements to my knowledge ."
2733,did you know the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ?
2734,"does taht still hold true , i 'd imagine not since it seems as if football stars make a lot more than that and they make much more from endorsements i , if a bowler endorse something , i do n't think i would know them ."
2735,i bet it does n't tilt old true .
2736,unless the league factors i that they only average about 11 minutes of live gameplay so maybe it silo does
2737,that 's crazy it 's only 11 minutes of play .
2738,"yes and yet i devote an entire afternoon to watching the games ! the circular huddle hat 's used in games today was actually created by a deaf quarterback so the opposing team could n't read his hand signs , he should 've trademarked that !"
2739,that 's a cool stat . i saw that greenellis is levee fumbled the ball in his nfl football career .
2740,"that 's hot an easy feat xosnider people are literally chasing ou when you possess the ball , wonder if he can negotiate a better salary with that stat ."
2741,i ca n't believe he never fumbled . never heard that stat before .
2742,"kellan moore is the only lefthanded quarterback , would the opposing team need to adjust their plays to accommodate that sseterity bias s ?"
2743,i 'm not sure what the opposing team would need to do to adjust .
2744,"if only the superbowl was ws entertaining as teh 1916 georgia tech game when theyd defeated cumberland by 2220 , actually i think that 'd be a pretty boring game as well ."
2745,that would be pretty crazy . i past super bowl was pretty boring . probably the most boring one ever .
2746,"yeah , it really was but i still watched hte whole thing . to my knowledge , i do n't think the real or patriots cheerleaders are treated like the saints cheelreade4s where the are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as the players ."
2747,it was good talking to ku take core !
2748,"hi , how are you ?"
2749,"hey irma food , soo yu have a favorite quarterback ?"
2750,i like jay cutler . do ou ?
2751,"ya he 's good , ia lso like tom brady , kellan moore is interesting because he i left handed and the only quarterback like that"
2752,yeah . i thought there would have been more lefty but i guess eh is the only on ? do you know who alex smith is ?
2753,"no i do n't , i think hes a quarterback ut thats all i know"
2754,"he took so many ap tests in high school , h entered college as a junior ! i barely passed high school . what a show off !"
2755,"wow he sounds real , its mart ! what is weird is that only 2 black quarterbacks have ever won the superbowl , i wonder why"
2756,racism . . . the huddle was created by a deaf qb . who knew !
2757,"ah interesting ! and ya apparenlty a quarterback threw a touchdown pass to himself , how is that possible ?"
2758,was it baker mayfield . he good at halo 3 ! he claims he can beat anyone at ou in the game .
2759,"wow thats impressive , also impressive that over half of th biggest world stadiums ware all american football stadiums"
2760,"there 's only one stadium that has a visiting locker room that is pink tough , the university of iowa !"
2761,"ya i bet ! only 1 team has a snoop dogg songs for their anthem , and that ie snoop doggs son 's team haha"
2762,espn won an emmy or that yellow line of the field for first downs . seems like a low bar for an emmy .
2763,"ya it seems obvious but maybe it was a big tech breakthrew at the time , have you seen those huge american flags at football stadiums ?"
2764,i have . the ones for the national anthem that is unfurralled ?
2765,"yup those , they cost 50k nad are over 1000 pounds , thats nuts !"
2766,i con understnad the cost burt 1000 pounds seems really heavy ! for only 11 minutes of play too !
2767,"yup it does seem likd he waste , did you hear about the tracking chips the nfl uses ?"
2768,"i love chips , especially doritos ! nice chatting with you !"
2769,do you like the cleveland browns team ?
2770,"not really . i do find o feel sorry for the . even with joe thomas , i wonder if they could turn thigns around ."
2771,i do n't really follow footbal at all to be honest . in my hometown football teamthe buffalo bills
2772,i 'm a chiefs fan myself . they do say the thomas will soon be in th euro football hall of fame . cold there ? it is here at 15 degrees and snow .
2773,"i think that 's great that he will be in the pro football hall of fame . yep it 's cold here . i 's in the 20s , but not much snow"
2774,"well , i have some snow you can have . i 've been to cannon , oh but regret not going to the hall of fame ."
2775,i 've never really gone anywhere . it does n't snow as much in buffalo as people think . only in certain areas . tyrion taylor used to be our quarterback .
2776,i remember him . a superb brown scan gave ne a browns cap on a flight i shared with her . i guess she was a member of the dog pound .
2777,"that 's so great ! i hear the browns shave really great fans . buffalo does too . we do n't ave a great team , but we love them ."
2778,back in the day the bills for well . was it the late 1980 ' ? did you know that the nfl has no rules that women ca n't play ?
2779,"yep , i think it was the late 80s that we did well . we went to 4 super bowls but could n't win any of them . they it one was the closest . it still breaks our hearts . the missed field goalie right are 2 words we all hate"
2780,who was the qb ? i can picture him bu that n't think of the name . . . did ya now that kellan moore is the only lefthanded qb in the nfl ?
2781,thaat is interesting about keilna moore . what team does he play for ? our qb 's nra was jim kelly . we love him . he 's battled cancer and won . we really admire him
2782,i 'm not sure . i 'm more of a football fan my alma mater . i played in hs and we used circular huddle . i did ' know that originated for a deaf qb .
2783,that 's great that you played in hs . but position did you play ? i did n't know circular huddles originated for a dear qb ! that 's fascinating !
2784,"i started as a defensive back , safety nd special teams . ah , the glory days . funny , we did n't gave any pink locker rooms for the visiting team but they did have to use the girls locker room ."
2785,"are you a female ? you ah mentioned girls can pay in the nfl . i 'm a female , but never played sports . 'm not very good at any sports"
2786,"having played footbal in hs ? nope , i 'm a dude . i bet to georgia tech and i had no idea we beat poor cumberland 220 in 1926 ."
2787,that 's awesome ! i think it 's sa when football payers have to retire before they ' r ready due to injuries
2788,that is terrible . i am grateful that espn created the superimposed yellow first down line . that makes the game more exciting .
2789,i agree . it makes the game much easier to follow for me . makes it more clear whether the player made the first down .
2790,thanks for the excellent chat ! good luck to the bills !
2791,seems like the redskins are in need o in wide receiver
2792,terrible prior did struggle quit i bit .
2793,"yeah hew didt catch on and the redskins need something more , among the prospects are alex smith , teddy brigewater , i think they can be god options for the team"
2794,it seem like they have a lot of good prospects toast were successful in college . but they have been really lavigne . that position for yeas
2795,"yeah seems like they need each , maybe they can help each othe get better hey used to be great players so maybe they can recover their leave"
2796,"maybe they just need a qb like brad johnson who noce threw a touchdown pass , t o himself ."
2797,"yeah or like tom brady , he didnt get a chance to play when he was a junipero high school so he might identify with the wide receiver the tema wants"
2798,i is kind of crazy that brady kind get that chance . he really showed them !
2799,"he did l i bet they rich of the former junipero high school team felt really stupid when he saw brady win all the superbowl , the us high school team was really bad"
2800,definitely . did you know there is only one left handed q bin the nfl
2801,"no i dint , do you know the name of that qb ?"
2802,kellan moore .
2803,"h so its kellan love , i thought hew as a righty , nice to know , do you know baker mayfield ?"
2804,didnt he almost leave football for professional gaming ?
2805,"no , i thin they was considering going it but stayed what football , he was a great halo 3 player , i wish i could play against him i have mad skills too"
2806,"i heard he thought he could beat everyone at his school , i have never played myself ."
2807,"yeah i did hear that too , he must be pretty good , g food in he stayed in football he is a great qb ,"
2808,"did you know that the flags that spam nthe field weigh 1 , 100 pounds and cost 50 , 000 ?"
2809,"taht really have and also really expensive , 50000 a pop ! taht way too much money"
2810,"i wonder if there are just a few ans tey pass them around . that is a lot of money , but they are also playing ome of the players millions ."
2811,"football players do make a lot of money m , its a good thing to be a pro player , great business specially if you are a qb"
2812,do you like football ? my favorite player is the quarterback
2813,i like football . the player 's ate the most i steph quarterback
2814,why is that ? what position do you like better ?
2815,"i lke defense . defense is most important on the field . they must be the toughest , th roughest , th best ."
2816,"i agree , a qb is no goo without a solid defence , so yeah they are really important"
2817,i figure that a good coach knows the value of defense in stopping those pesky qbs . the qb is a target . the qb is a meal the qb is fore acting .
2818,"there are women great qb out there , even the best ones get slacked"
2819,i like taking qbs ! they never see it coming because they 're behind the line .
2820,"thas why they must have a great defensive line , do you now who baker mayfield is ?"
2821,is he was b ? who ish e ?
2822,"he is a qb , eh considered quitting football and become a pro gamer , apparently he is really good at halo 3"
2823,he probably should stick to video games . that is the same et . career is much longer .
2824,"i agree , you can get really injured by playing football then theres also the brain damage ,"
2825,the brain damage from video games is pretty bad too . i had a friend that played them too much . ended up about a simple as a retired played .
2826,"really ? i didnt know about that , but it makes sense , playing video games that long lean hve negative consequences for sure"
2827,"the brain is a fragile organ , not designed to withstand hours of babal stimulation and entertainment . there should be a warning label o games about cognitive impairment ."
2828,"there should be , but i doubt that will stop gamers , did you hear about the qb that created the circular huddle ?"
2829,i ahve not hard that joke . whats the pundhline ?
2830,"not a joke lol , he was a deaf qb that invented the huddle so tha the other team wouldnt dead hi signals"
2831,"oh , ok , that is cool . i thought you were telling a joke . he invented the huddle ? hte guy is a legend . anyway , great chat !"
2832,"nope , wasnt join lol , good chat ,"
2833,"hi , how are you ?"
2834,very good . did you see the size bowl last sunday . as usual th afc and the nfc champs square of one the first sunday of february ?
2835,"unfortunately , i did not get a chance to watch . what about you ?"
2836,yes . tom brady was the winning qb again . the average has game only ha 11 minutes of live gameplay . but those are a strenuous 11 minutes .
2837,"on a perminute basis , they ge paid pretty wel a there is no rule against women in the game . what do you think : will we have women any time soon ?"
2838,"maybe a kicker someday . probably for publicity purposes mainly . since there are 3 team , each year there are 31 losers ."
2839,"a kicker , or a punter , i agree . there is only one lefthanded quarterback in the nfl : relaly moore . there are many lefthanded pitchers . why so few lefty qbs ?"
2840,"left handed pitchers are hard for left handed batters to hit . i was an assistant scout fo 'the phillies in years past . however , a pass from a lefty i football spins tha opposite wy and i a little difficult to defend if you do n't see it often ."
2841,so lefty qbs have an advantage ? interesting . i thought maybe the front line chad to protect the q differently because hte blind side is different . but what do i know anyway .
2842,the alabama qb os a lefty and came in second or the heisman this year . he may win it next year since he was a freshman . how would you like veto enter th visitor 's dressing room at iowa and dress witht pink walls .
2843,"i guess that 's supposed 69 psych out the opposition , but it seems weak . how many game has u of i won at home ?"
2844,"they are better than average , but it elite at home . in the 1970 's , pro bowlers made twice as much as pro football players ."
2845,"bowling is a ' sport , ' but not really so strenuous or violent as football . probably have good career longevity . nobody watches bowling 'the come as they did then ."
2846,"that 's the amazing thing . he market o 'the nfl wash such smaller and they have t pay a lot more players . smaller than now , not smaller than bowling 's market ."
2847,"i suess tv changes everything . teh first sb was in the 60s , so i guess they segue had n't organized itself well enough . college ball might have been the bigger draw ."
2848,"i pink it was . i mentioned tom brady before . in his jv high school years his team did not win a game , did not score a td and he was th backup and never played a down !"
2849,the coach really blew it here . i think brady has succeeded because of his teammates and head coach as well .
2850,"true . in college , h e playes for michigan and they hardly passed the ball . so he was drafted 199 . he had talent and no one knew how much . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that ge entered college s a junior . qbs can be smart ."
2851,i do n't know much about the college game . the highest score eve in a football game was in 1916 . georgia tech crushed cumberland 2220 . i wonder if the gt coach put in the third string . what was he going to prove ?
2852,"my brother playes guard in high school and they were beating some team 740 and my brother got to play qb , and he scored . i am surprised he knew where to stand in the huddle where the qb calls the plays ."
2853,"the game should be fun , especially for kids . i enjoyed chatting with you ! have a good night !"
2854,"thanks , bye ."
2855,hey my friend do you have a favorite quarterback ?
2856,"well , i am not into football but i think i would be crazy to not say payton manning ."
2857,"i like brady myself , and i did n't know that kellan moore is actually left handed"
2858,i like tom brady as well . his super bowl wins are so impressive .
2859,"ya i agree , did you hear the backstory to baker mayfield ?"
2860,"yes , he once considered quitting football to game competitively ."
2861,"ya , he made tha right mover ! did you hear how he footbal huddle was created ?"
2862,it was created by a deaf quarterback who did not want hte ever team to read is hand signals . i like knowing the reason behind the traditions .
2863,"ya me too , it is a genius thing , c name believe the highest footbal score of all time was 2220 , thats a blowout !"
2864,that sounds ike an overpowered team having fun at the other teams expense .
2865,"ya , i would feel so bad to be a cumberland fan that day ! that was back in 119 though"
2866,football has changed a lot over the years and is even very different in different countries . i like the way they play football in cananda .
2867,"oh what is the difference in how they play the ? i just think the it was great espn won an emmy for the yellow line they created for first downs in tv football , games"
2868,theory have a larger field in canada . they also get espn in canada and it is very popular .
2869,"ah interesting ill have to look into tha t , do you like the patriots ? they have 1 player who actually has never fumbled the ball"
2870,"everyone loves the patriots except those who have to com , pete next ti them in the super bowl . was tat tom brady who have fumbles the hall ."
2871,"haha it was not it was benjarvus greenellis , i 'd give him the ball every time !"
2872,"oh , i should learn more names from the team . are the patriots your favorite team ?"
2873,"yes i do love the patriots , i 'm just glad they made a lot of money too , unlike i nthe 60 's where bowlers made more that nfl players !"
2874,apparently the average lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than the average nfl player .
2875,"ya that is shocking , also shocking is there is no rule against female nfl players !"
2876,if a woman could meet the requirements then they would be eligible see i can imagine that would be very difficult .
2877,"ta i would think so , but i could see a kicker or something happening in our lifetime"
2878,"hi , do you watch american football"
2879,"i do not . i used to go to some games in high school but wold get distracted by whatever else was happening . i have no de that there are , many different variations of american football . i have watched rugby before though ."
2880,"ohh , i have not watched any rugby come before . btw , did you watch th super bowl last year between the patriot and eagle"
2881,"i did not . if so , i usually only watch fo 'the musical guest . i know that the patriots seem to make it every year . i think its crazy that reed johnson threw a touchdown pass to himself . he must ge fast ! did you watch ?"
2882,"i did watch the game . actually th quarterback that threw the pass to himself was nic foles , if i am not mistaken"
2883,"is it ? i just read it in actual section , never actually saw it ."
2884,i have rewatched the game so many views because it was one of the best super bowl games in the history
2885,that 's cool . who 's your favorite team ?
2886,"green bay packers , yu ?"
2887,none of the above . i think its cool though that the nfl started from such humble beginnings .
2888,"yeah , they grow so fast and become the most popular sport in north america . also , did you know that there are only 11 minute of alive gameplay in an nfl game ?"
2889,"wow ! and that gem goes on forever r ! hours ! why do you like it so much ? i 'm curious how sports can grow to make stadiums in texas that seat 18 , 000 ."
2890,sport game makes me both free nervous and loyalty to the team that i root for . waht do ou feel
2891,it makes me feel bored . are you from wisconsin ? that 's where the green bay packers are from ?
2892,"i am from california , but i a ma green bay fan because heir fan 's loyalty got my enthusiasm for football ."
2893,that 's cool to hear . football watchers are a pretty loyal bunch . even snoopdogg wrote a song for his hugh school football team .
2894,"yeh , i heard those snoopdogg 's songs and they were hilarious and enjoyable . btw , did you know that women are eligible to play pro football if they are qualified ?"
2895,i wonder what the qualifications are ? i did't know that before this . i never realized how serious it is . it crazy how one of the coaches is a rocket scientist !
2896,"if a woman has the skill as a man , then she can play the game as long as a pet recruits her playing fo them"
2897,are these any women in the nfl right now ?
2898,"no so far . to , nice chatting with you . enjoy your holiday"
2899,you too ! merry christmas ! and next year be your year for your team !
2900,the browns have made a strategic more and are expected to do well because of it .
2901,i saw they agreed to trade to draft picks to the dolphins .
2902,"yes , yes , and they got jarvis laundry who led the nfl kin the as season ."
2903,he phd 112 catches last season . they also agreed to send a 3 round pick o the bills .
2904,they got tyrion taylor for that trade . it looks like a potential trade for damarious sandals is still in the works .
2905,todd harley will have a nice roster and pretyy of potential .
2906,the browns might even get their pick of prized quarterbacks .
2907,"would n't taht be awesome , e ? they are wondering if taylor was the right selection . he was benched in favor of a rookie ."
2908,"yes , eh did help to reach the playoffs but seems like hew as in over his head against jacksonville ."
2909,taylor 's just the temporary starter quarterback . they could draft sam darnold or josh risen .
2910,that is good . i seemed a i taylor 's performance is a bi unpredictable .
2911,he started the last three season and only has 51 touchdowns . i would be a little leary . there 's always room for improvement .
2912,why do you think they traded for taylor ?
2913,he wasnt valuable to them anymore ep the could get a new player who would pair well with the players .
2914,it seems that they have several different choices for quarterbacks and the it 's a step in the right direction .
2915,or what if they go with penn stat running back saquon barkley ?
2916,i do n't know too much about him but it seems ike that would be a surprise choice .
2917,theyd would n't have their choice of quartet backs .
2918,"yes , but it seems they would still get one of them ?"
2919,"the consultant to the browns , scots mccloughan like mayfield ."
2920,"yes , he likes mayfield , but apparently mayfield is polarizing . i wonder what that earns ."
2921,he just has a presence about him likely lamar jackson . people who to see him play because e all the great attributes .
2922,i see
2923,"hello , the national football league , nfl , is a professional american football league consisting of 325 ems , divided equally between the national football conference , m nfc , an 'the american football conference , afc , ."
2924,dud you know that hey use tracking chips in footballs and shoulder pads in the fl ?
2925,"not at all , what does this work for ."
2926,"they use it in footballs to track velocity , rotation , ball speed and location . in the shoulder pads theyre record players every move on th field"
2927,"go , they want to have all the movements calculated , this football is fantastic"
2928,if you visited iowas looker so it is pink .
2929,"yes , yes , i 've heard a lot about it , i heard that the do it to scare other teams or show that they are better"
2930,that is strange ! former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never tumbled in the nfl !
2931,"he 's talented , i think that 's what i think competigiveness"
2932,do you watch favorite football games on thanksgiving ?
2933,"yes , i am always aware of the mates"
2934,prediction were tha 'the cowboys would beat the redskins . th jaguars were stated to be an unreliable team in the nfl .
2935,"wow , this team must have an excellent football behavior"
2936,steers ben roethlisberger ranks 8th in qb
2937,"well , they should improve if they want to occupy the first place"
2938,haha . teh huddle was created by a deaf quarterback to prevent his hand signals from being read
2939,there are so many surprises everywhere
2940,in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars
2941,seriously ? there must have been more public kon one side than on the other supporting rye sport
2942,also the average lifetime earnings of a engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl and average mlb layer
2943,"well , being an engineer was a lot of things"
2944,hey there ! are you a fan of the nfl ?
2945,hello ! i am ! are you ?
2946,"i am ! co you have a favorite team ? i 'm from texas , so i 'm obligatdd to root for the cowboys !"
2947,haha i am a viking sun ! the cowboys see fun to watch too ! ca 'you believe the is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay ?
2948,"no ! that 's wild ! it 's hard to follow on thye tv sometimes , so thank goodness they created that superimposed yellow liken fo 'the first down ."
2949,did n't that win an emmy for espn ?
2950,it did ! a tv network won it award for tv shows !
2951,john ice ! i ish they had footage of that game that was 222 to 1916 !
2952,right ? ! back won georgia tech beat cumberland
2953,had would have been a sight to see . a very sad sight lol . do you have a favorite quarterback ?
2954,have ! i do n't . . . none that still play anyway . are you a tom brady fan ?
2955,oh gotcha ! i think he 's a good player but i would n't call hi emmy favorite haha .
2956,"yeah , people disagree with his morals , i guess , haha ! did you know his jv watch did n't car much for him either ?"
2957,h paid n't even put them in when they were doing absolutely terrible ! jokes on him i guess !
2958,right ? he went on to win 4 super bowls !
2959,6 nor actually lol . do you ever think a girl will ever tryout for a team ?
2960,"i 'm not sure . i kno wthe 're technically allowed , and i would love to see that ! it 's just such a sexist industry ."
2961,i really is ! i would love to see it too ! the saints are sexist about their cheerleaders as well !
2962,"i not , can you believe the cheerleaders ate forced to get up midmeal if any nfl player walks in ?"
2963,"stat is crazy ! they need to update that like they do their technology ! anyways , it was great chatting with you !"
2964,enjoy your night !
2965,hello do you wathc nfl ; ?
2966,i do watch thye nfl . do you ?
2967,love it . what team sport .
2968,absolutely l i ca n't believe an average game is only 11 minutes without commentary and commercials .
2969,i wish the season than 16 games .
2970,"i wonder why female players are playing football , apparently it 's not against the rules ."
2971,maybe one will start as a kicker ?
2972,that would be cool .
2973,did you know here are ship in the footballs to track ?
2974,"no did n't , tha i interesting . what exactly to the chips track ?"
2975,goof question since the refs still we a lot of cal ; s wrongly ol .
2976,i know right . maybe that ' she the h9gehst scoring a ever was 2220 !
2977,georgia tech should be ashamed to run up the score like that !
2978,"haha , i know it 's crazy ."
2979,or you would think cumberland would have forested
2980,least you would think so . do you think it 's kind of mean to paint a visiting 's team locker room pink or smart t ? the university of iowa did .
2981,mind game si guest ? did you know espn won an emmy for inventing the yellow line ?
2982,that is a weird thing to win an emmy for .
2983,i wonder if rb rene ellis every ot anything for not fumbling or his whole career ?
2984,"i 'm not sure but he should have , that 's a huge accomplishment ."
2985,yeah i would be proud ! nice talking to you nad good night !
2986,"you too , bye !"
2987,"hello , how are you today !"
2988,"good , do you like any variations of football , from rugby to soccer ?"
2989,"yes , i love to go to the football game nd soccer !"
2990,but do you have a favorite between soccer and football ?
2991,"long time buccaneers an , and new england !"
2992,"ok , you seem to know more ethan a few things bout football if you can appreciate 2 teams at the same time . since when do you watch hte nfl ?"
2993,since jr . high school a long tim . a whole family thing ! and you ?
2994,"i do n't watch football regularly , not the nthe superbowl , there are 11 minutes of live gameplay in a game . it is not enough to sustain my attention ."
2995,"yes , i understand . do you like soccer ? i love that too !"
2996,"i wish i watched ore soccer , but they do n't show matches where i live , do you have a favorite soccer tegan ?"
2997,"we have a new team , where we live so getting popular . i didnt now there is no written rule against female players . lol"
2998,it is either progressive from their part . progressive as an unkikley concept
2999,"ha , ha , ha , i was thinking the same thing !"
3000,"i aves mbiguouas feeling but the nfl , it is quite violent , there are only 16 games in a season , it is probably because if there were more there would be too much injuries among the players ."
3001,"yes , i agree ! those tracking chips are helpful as far as tracking . how about taht 220 score in 1916 !"
3002,hat is around 30 touchdowns ! or a td every 2 minute . i think people just stopped clapping to save their hands .
3003,"lol , picture that ! omg . . . top football stars made less than top bowlers in 1960 ."
3004,"it was another era , it bowling could be as violent as football today , bowler would be paid more ."
3005,"your right ! lol , did n't know cheerleaders have to leave when football player comes into restaurant . guess too much togetherness ! ol good that ! !"
3006,"that is another retrograde attitude from the nfl l , i hope that will change ethan soon ."
3007,"yes , i do too 41"
3008,hey ! do you follow football ?
3009,hello ! i follow football as much as i can . probably equal parts college and the national football league . how about you ?
3010,"i tend mores o the college side , but it is all good by me"
3011,"i guess you might as real through in high school as wel , especially if you ar man texas . allen , texas , has a 60 million , 18 k seat high school stadium !"
3012,that is huge ! that team is probably pretty good to have that kind of facility . much better than cumberland from 1916 !
3013,tell me more abou cumberland do do they have a team anymore ?
3014,"im knots the , but they lost to ga tech 2220 in 1916 ."
3015,"wow . it must be some sort of record . speaking of lovable losers , the cleveland browns returned to the nfl in 1999 . despite playing eight home games per season , do you know who ha 'the most wins in that stadium ? opposing steelers quarterbacks en roethlisberger ."
3016,"wow , even more wins than the browns ? that 's sad . my tea m , the dolphins isnt much better though ."
3017,"at least he weather i nicer . maybe you need a rocket science head coach . believe it or not , coach matt patricia actually is a rocket science !"
3018,"maybe he can figure out why it takes 3 plus hours o play a ga , e whe there is only 11 minutes of active game play ."
3019,he should get right on that . they spend so much money already . players and even the footballs have tracking devices that record every movement on hte field .
3020,i wonder how they use all that data . it seems like gathering it they should have a big purpose for ifr .
3021,"i am sure part of it is to unsure they are getting the most out of their investments . i wonder how that works for russell wilson who has n't played baseball since 2011 , but is still on an mlb contract q"
3022,id like that did of deal !
3023,"amazingly he is also only one left wo africanamerican quarterbacks to win a super bowl . doug william was the first . interestingly , they both lost heir wins over the broncos ."
3024,"that 's pretty incredible . i remember when warren moon played in the nfl for the vikings , i think eh was the first african american quarterback in the nfl , but not the first to win ."
3025,"some big name quarterbacks for sure , but none may ever reach brad johnson who actually is the only qb to throw a td pass to himself . i bust have benz tipped 10"
3026,"had to have been , although i am curious to see the highlight reel for that one ."
3027,"the nfl has definitely come a long way since . i mean , way back in 1932 the first playoff game was actually played on a dirtfield in a hockey stadium stat was only 80 yards long ."
3028,"is , it certainly has . even recent years improvise home viewing wish replays and that tells line ."
3029,i could n't imagine a game without it and constantly have to remind myself the players a n't he it !
3030,"haha ! me to , my mom was shocked when he wen t my brothers first high school games years ago taht the line wasnt there ."
3031,lol . i wonder whats he would think if she fund out that the big american flag sims the stadiums cost like 50 k and weigh about a ton !
3032,kill have to tell her ! its been great chatting tonight !
3033,"did you watch the nfl games last weekend ? my favorite team the ravens , and their new b lamar jackson , unfortunately have already been eliminated ."
3034,i did watch . that happened to jo franco ?
3035,"he 's gt hurt , missed a few games , lamar took his spot , and that 's all she wrote ."
3036,what do ou think of saints quarterback drew brees ? he 's good whether he 's under pressure or not .
3037,"yeah , he 's been good to a long time . they had been crushing teams until this past weekend . even their defense wa clicking . oh well . that was a bad call though ."
3038,"i heard they wore white because the coach lost a bet to age eagles coach ,"
3039,possibly . if i had to start a team though i 'd definitely take andrew luck over brees . he had a good reason bheindh is renamed offensive line .
3040,so what o you thin about a possible female coach ? the browns want to talk to condoleezza rice about the job .
3041,i do n't see it . i know there is no written yule preventing female players either but not sure how realistic that is .
3042,strangers things ahve happened . matt patricia is a rocket scientist or aeronautical beginner .
3043,"i know . maybe he should do that because he has n't been very successful as a head coach . through the 17 wee regular season , ge has n't proven enough to m yet ."
3044,i think he needs another year to see . it 's tough to judge a coach based on the first year .
3045,"i suppose . he must like it though . 'the average lifetime mannings are statistically higher for an engineer has an nfl player , so you could do fine elsewhere ."
3046,true . seems like more is spent ton stadiums than people . a high school football stadium int exams cost 60 million to build .
3047,"yeah , i knew hs football is huge in tx . not as big as te superbowl which is usually held the first sunday in february , but still huge ."
3048,college football is getting huge too . 14 of the world largest stadiums are from american colleges .
3049,yup . baker mayfield from the university of ok played in a pretty large stadium .
3050,yes he did . players can do more than just footbal to earn money tough . russell wilson is under contract with te texas rangers baseball team til last year .
3051,and baker mayfield actually considered quitting football to pursue full time competitive gaming .
3052,now that 's interesting ! the military footbal teams roaches work for the department of defense . they are the highest paid employees there .
3053,taht must be a good job . defensive coach for a military foot team . i wonder how much gameplay tim eis i bathe college game . the average nfl game on has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay .
3054,"i do n't know . i guess it 's be close to the same . but then again , football has different variations and rules globally ."
3055,do you like football ?
3056,i love it . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker rpm pins ?
3057,i wonder if that is supposed to have ome effect on the players
3058,good point . bowlers made more in the 60s they football players
3059,yes i guess football was not as popular back i the day
3060,true . do you know the highest score in a college football game
3061,yes that was 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
3062,yes and that was way back i 1916
3063,yes . did you know that espn won an emmy once ?
3064,yes tha team for the superimposed yellow line
3065,yeah it has made gamewatching easier for sue
3066,yeah true . do you like brady ?
3067,i love him he is so goo ? did you know he was a backup qb in high school
3068,yes and they never started him even when they were doing really bad in the field
3069,yeah their los use do you liek alex smith ?
3070,"yrs i do , eh is good at school too , finished college in two years"
3071,yes he took lots of ap tests in high school and plane dread
3072,yeah smart kid . d you know who invented the circular huddle ?
3073,yes paul hubbard who was deaf and did no want other to understand him
3074,a smart . it was nice chatting with you
3075,"same here , take care"
3076,"hello here , do you follow the nfl at all ?"
3077,"hello , i love the nfl . what about you ?"
3078,"yeah i follow pretty closely during the season , i thought the super bowl was n't nearly as exciting as , so year though ."
3079,this super bowl was . boring lol . did you know iowa painted the opposing team locker room pink ?
3080,"yeah it was and i think i hear about tha t ! too funny , i wonder who came up with that video in the first place ?"
3081,not too sure ol bt he 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars .
3082,"that is pretty wild , i would have loved to been a bowler back then . if also shows how much the nfl has grown since then ."
3083,i agree . bowling stars probably do n't make much there days .
3084,"no , and definitely not much compared to the salaries that pro football player snow make ."
3085,most definitely . hte highest score ever in s football game was 2220 .
3086,"that is incredible ! i think i have read about that game , i think it was poor cumberland on the losing side of that one ."
3087,that would be one very boring game to watch . i would hav given up if i was on cumberland .
3088,"yeah those fans to , i wonder how many of the cumberland faithful weed still there when it ended ."
3089,i debt no on nwas still around lol . greenellis went his entire football career without fumbling the ball .
3090,"that ks very impressive , i wonder how many total carries he had kin his career ?"
3091,rib et he ha da got because he was a started . i remember watching him with the bengals . i 'm a bengals fan .
3092,yeah nd if you have played for multiple teams chances are you have had your fair spare .
3093,i bert . did you know the nfl uses tracking chips in players pads ?
3094,"i have heard that , crazy how much tech is in the game no , do you think it ill be used ti improve safety ?"
3095,"i hope so . they track ball speed , velocity , rotation , and location . nice chatting wit hyou !"
3096,"yeah same here , hope you hav a good day !"
3097,i was so bad the patriots won the super bowl ! they 're my tend because i lived in new england for awhile . did you watch the game ?
3098,"hayes , at as good . the game started off slow until he fourth quarter ."
3099,yeah it wa sa pretty low scoring game . and i thought the halftime show was just as boring . are you a maroon 5 fan ?
3100,"no , i as sure who they were until i looked them up online , i think the lights and fire display help their performance ."
3101,"i knew of them , but i did n't know of any of their songs . what i think is funny is that the university o iowa ' ; s locker room for the visiting football team is lpaitned pink ! t hat 's sort of pet !"
3102,"i agree , i guess they painted it pink specially for visitors , in a way of speaking visiting yeas are weak ."
3103,yeah exactly . and it 's crazy how much football players are paid today compared to the 1960s when professional bowlers were actually paid more than football players .
3104,"his that 's true , back in the 1960s the players were n't protective as teh are today with added helmets and so many penalty calls ."
3105,yeah i bet they had a lot of injuries ! also it shocked me to hear the highest football scoring me was 2220 ! ouch !
3106,"wow , i wonder what kind of footbal team they were playing and what about the coach , what did he had to say ?"
3107,"it was college football , but if that happened in teh nfl , they would e heckler for running up the score for like rubbing it into their competitor 's faces . i guess they did n't exist back then ."
3108,"yes you are right and maybe i am wrong , but i think the coach would n't have any excuse to remain coaching that team ."
3109,yeah that could be it too . and i also did n't know espn won an emmy for being the first chanel o upset he artificial yellow line to marks where th first down line . that really helps to know where the teams actually have to go to get a first down .
3110,"i did n't know that either , never cross my mind , yes i ca n't imagine playing on a team without known where teh first down marker ."
3111,do you have a favorite football team or care you not interested in footbal ; ?
3112,"i like football . i like college football better than pro football . y favorite team pittsburgh , what about you ?"
3113,my favorite team is the patriots . i really think tom brady will be the of the best qbs in the hall of fame . it 's crazy that in high school he was a backup qb and new got a chance to play .
3114,"forgot , you did tell me you team earlier , yes , people think that the patriots won , many games super bowls , but not really , talent is talent , their sixth ring ."
3115,yeah the most super bowl wins ever . i wondr if that title will ever be broken .
3116,"i dont ' think so , because the patriots always had a smart coach , he fro behind team and a calm quarterback ."
3117,yeah bleichek is one of their secret weapon along with tom brady . they make a good team .
3118,do you follow football ? my favorite position is the qb
3119,i do follow football im a chiefs fan but i do like tom brad he is very talented
3120,"he is really talented , i am a fan of the patriots o i definitley love him ,"
3121,yeah the patriots have had a lot of good players like eli . h never fumbled a football in his entire career with the nfl .
3122,"that 's amazing . the level of skill tthat requires , i bet only a few players have accomplished stat or my ellis is the only one , sounds like a hard thing to do ."
3123,yeah i bet it would be hard to do . . i blast superbowl was kinda sad . . i can the scores where jet so low . .
3124,"i was sad , i was happy becaue my team won but it was a boring superbowl , hopefully next year we can watch a better show"
3125,yeah hopefully i went to wa chiefs game this year it was exciting mahomes is a great quarterback
3126,"i havent seen hi play , how old is he ?"
3127,he is 23 i stink he is like the youngest player t ever get the dvd or the nfl
3128,sounds like the chiefs ave a qb for a while . he can be the next brady .
3129,that 's what i hope will happen . before becoming the first overall pick in 2005 draft alex smith recieved his bachelors degree int wo years . then he went to to get his masters . i could ' imagine being a quarterback and doing that much school in that much time .
3130,"sounds like he is not only a great qb but soso a really smart person , he received the degree erin just 2 years and then his masters , thats incredible"
3131,haha it is l . . did you know that the huddle was started by a deaf quarterback paul hubbard is . he did it so the othe team couldnt read his signals
3132,"she started a legacy , taht is a sure thing , do you know who baker mayfield is ?"
3133,no who is he
3134,"he is a qb not only talented in the game but also a master video game player , he almost nfl football to become a pro gamer"
3135,well he can aways do that when h retires from football
3136,"i use he can , he will have plenty of time and money to pursue that other dream ,"
3137,most definitely . . when tom brady was in highschool his coach never started him
3138,"thats ironic , considering brady is like the best qb in the history of it , lol"
3139,good morning ! how are you ? i ma sad football is over for the season . are you a fan .
3140,goo dmornign q i am a fan and am sad a swell . i 'm watching the new football league . make up for it . its ot the nfc or afc conferences but it 's still nfl .
3141,i 've not heard of that . i 'm only familiar with the 32 nfl teams .
3142,i think it 's called the alliance of american football . it started up after the superbowl back n february .
3143,i 'm surprised that i 've not heard of it . i like that he nfl allows women to play as long as they can meet league requirements .
3144,i think all of the games are shown on the nfl network . i like that too . maybe someday there will be gone on hte teams .
3145,"i think it would be dangerous for women to play al , alongside men . i guess the nfl rules are more forward thinking that the rules the saints have for their cheerleaders ."
3146,perhaps boat if a woman can meet the requirements then hose would have had to prove herself strong and capable . what kind o rules do the saints have ?
3147,"yes , i guess tat is a good point . saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as n no player ."
3148,maybe they do that to prevent scandals in the news and such . keep the players focused on the same ?
3149,"maybe , but it kind it 's extreme to think that if ac cheerleader is already at a restaurant and a player comes in she has to get up and leave , even midmeal ."
3150,"well yeah , thay is extreme . the should change that to he ask person to walk on a to leave regardless sofa whether they are a played roar q cheerleader ."
3151,i agree . i can ot believe how little actually ive game play these is ina n average game .
3152,what do you mean ?
3153,i guess an average game only has something like 11 minutes of actual game play .
3154,"wow , that is a surprise . i mean , a game lasts three hours and they only actually play for 11 minutes ?"
3155,i know ! an even more interesting fact is that an engineer over a lifetime earns more than an average nfl player .
3156,that is interesting . it really makes you think . especialy when you realize all that goes into a game and players . the nfl spends money to put tracking chips on the players to record their every movements .
3157,yes m i 've heard they put tracking chips in the players shoulder read . i bet it helps make strategic game plays .
3158,"i bet it does too . then there are chips inside the footballs to record it 's movement slow . in a way , football is becoming very scientific ."
3159,"yes , i agree ! it has been on daunting today . have a good day !"
3160,are you a fan of the nfl ?
3161,hey ! yes i am a big nfl fan . the cars are my team !
3162,"nice , they are not nba of the 32 teams . sorry but i a a viking fan . . . ."
3163,"haha , my wife is a vikings fans o i cheer for them too . it is crazy to love a sport so much that only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay !"
3164,"nice good to ear that . that is so crazy to think only 11 minutes , i wonder what is th eater 3 hours lol"
3165,"a lot of filler and cheerleaders ! fun fact i recently learned about cheerleaders , the saints forbid their cheerleaders from eating in the same restaurant as any of their players ."
3166,"that is n't too fun , it sounds kind of sexist , what do you think ?"
3167,"it is sexist for sure and wrong . interestingly enough , the nfl has nor yule prohibiting female players !"
3168,"i 'm surprised ! i could n't imagine that happening , but id id hear a female kicker may be the first soon"
3169,that would be cool . i know some college teams have had female kickers . colorado is the biggest school to have i believe .
3170,"wow , i did not know taht . my team is the iowa hawkeyes , they have a pin locker room for visitors"
3171,"that is some subtle gamesmanship ! i actually went to maryland . our recent coordinator hire , at canada , had to take over the coaching duties last year ."
3172,"yea taht was unfortunate on what happened with the player an coach being fired , sad to hear"
3173,"yes , a very sad story al around . canada was pretty good last season . he set school records at pitt for his offensive production ."
3174,"nice , i did not know that . i wonder if benjarvus green ellis played for him in college . he never fumbled once in his football career"
3175,that is a crazy stat ! it is amazing how far football has come . at one point in the 1960s the top bowlers were taking double the top football stars !
3176,"that is so crazy , now it pays to e an engineer though , they make more money in their lifetime than most played soo"
3177,"that is shocking ! i wonder if she playes are actually really smart like alex smith . he had so many ap credits , he was able to enroll in college as a high school senior !"
3178,"that is crazy to think , and he became the first overall pick in 2005 , smart man ! good chatting with you ."
3179,nic chanting witht you today too !
3180,have a great day !
3181,"hi , do you watch nfl ?"
3182,"hey , yeah i do ."
3183,di doyou now women ca play too ?
3184,"no , really ? i thought it was just for men ."
3185,"nope , i you skate the cut , you play"
3186,that 's cool . i hope to see a woman in the nfl one day . do you think it 's true saints cheerleaders ca n't eat at the sam restaurant as if players ?
3187,yeah but i totally diasgbre with that rule . they have to even leave eli they are mid meal
3188,i know ! that is insane .
3189,did you know they are less than engineers ?
3190,"i wonder how much engineers make because nfl players make a lots . oh , i seen where the nfl uses tracking chips in players 's pad and the footballs !"
3191,yeah that is really ice becuase they can get lots of useful statistics from those now
3192,"yeah , i did n't know that . it makes sense how the announcer are able to view the replays and stuff ."
3193,yeah for sure . did yo kno where are only 11 minutes of gameplay in a game e ?
3194,"yeah , and everything else is commercials and replays ."
3195,yeah exactly . you know what the highest score in football history is ?
3196,"no , i 'm not are , what is it ?"
3197,it is 2220
3198,that i insane ! what teams ?
3199,"georgia tech beat th cumberland , yeah it is insane and bring i would assume"
3200,"very boring , ac complete blow out ."
3201,for sure . nice chat
3202,hi . are you a college football fan ?
3203,i like the nfl
3204,"okay ! me , too . which team , s , do you like best ?"
3205,i like the patriots since they are like th lannisters of football
3206,definitely . did you ? this year 's sb ?
3207,the opening was q bit slow
3208,"sure , but the 4th quarter made up for it q what do you think of tom brady ?"
3209,"despite lisa ge , he is still an amazing player"
3210,"agree . did you know that , when e played jv football , his hear did n't win a game or even score a td , yet his coach never put him , as backup qb , into a game ! think hes come a long way since those days ?"
3211,ya he was underappreciated can now he is considered the biggest steal in nfl history
3212,"for sure . prob . the greatest qb , with 6 sb rings to date . watching his throws is a thing of beauty . wonder why fb teams do n't huddle much anymore ?"
3213,well the huddle initally were created by a deaf qb to prevent other players from seeing his hand signals
3214,that masked sense . does huddle take on much time ?
3215,"hot really , but it is kind of like a group cheer too"
3216,"is i . am a big ten penn the fan . loved to watch saquon barkley , now a rb w or the ny giants run . stinky e just won rookie of the year . have you seen him ?"
3217,"no , but curious to learn more"
3218,"watch 2018 season highlights on youtube . barkley is featured . do you like patriot ; s rb , gronkowski ?"
3219,i liked rene ellis more
3220,"okay . know him , too . great player ! bad has a lot of choices really deep offensive line , doh n't you think ?"
3221,ya i mean the qb is th encore of any offensive
3222,"and its leader . do yiu thin k , if they met eli . requirements , we 'll ever see women on nfl games ?"
3223,"anyway , thanks for chatting and i hope you have a wonderful day ."
3224,"you1 , too . catch saquon 's magical athleticism if yiu have time ! cheers !"
3225,"hello , do you play or watch football ? , american football ,"
3226,"yea , i'ts funny how th redskins were label to blow the nfc east load softer winning overs dallas early in the season"
3227,"haha , agreed . did you know that greenellis has lever fumbled a ball in his entire career ?"
3228,"thati is pretty crazy , i remember greenellis use to play for the patriots , i don ' ithink i 've seen him fumble"
3229,"yep , imagine not fumbling a bail for your entire career . so have been hard !"
3230,"yea , i wonder if the nfl was able to find out how he did it with the tracking chips they put into player ' equipment"
3231,i wonder . they also put tracking chips in the footbal alto track its velocity and rotation . maybe that helps as wel .
3232,"possibly , it 's amazing how much info they can get when teh lame only average 11 minutes of live gameplay"
3233,yeah . i wonder how people do not get bored while watching fooball .
3234,i do n't know l i wonder if that was why top bowlers made twice as much as football players in the 1960s
3235,i wonder bow they made so much . engineers also make more than football players in their lifetimes .
3236,"i heard engineers make more than mlb players too , i guess paying attention in school pays off"
3237,"yep , although i am guessing that you have to be a veteran engineer to make that much ;"
3238,"i suppose . , i bet cumberland had a team lull of engineers when they lost to georgia tech 2220"
3239,"well , that was back in 1916 but that still must have been a very embarrassing defeat ."
3240,"yea , tv was n't even around back then bu to we got yellow first down line winning emmys"
3241,did you know that kellan moore is teh one left handed quarterback in teh nfl ?
3242,that 's pretty crazy but not as crazy s deaf quarterback paul d . hubbard
3243,i wonder how he even communicated strategy with his team then .
3244,hubbard invented the huddle just to do so using hand signals
3245,"nad tom the it so that the other team could not see his hand signals . anyways , thank you for your time ! it was nice chatting with you !"
3246,"you too , have a good one"
3247,hi ! so you follows sports of any kind ?
3248,"not usually , but id o keep an eye on the nfl when it gets near these playoffs"
3249,"so it makes it you do n't participate in sports gambling then ? it 's actually legal in any state eat wants to pursue it according to a supreme court ruling , 9 had no idea !"
3250,i can udnersand thet ewing a state level law though with how much money nevada 's government probalby makes . the trends would be hard to predict tough
3251,"yeah , you ar nw jersey , d delaware , wet virginia a , and mississippi have participated in it and legalized it and it 's also been to ncaa as well as pro sports as well . seems so risky though !"
3252,definitely ! i 'd much rather watch the game for enjoyment thank et my money on asnyhting . i went to a few highs school games back in the day . their first songs as n't nearly as cool as the one snoop dig would have written for his son 's team
3253,"yeah , i think i would feel so ants and suffer from immense tachycardia if i were to place money on the outcome of a am . i wonder if players are paid ' side money ' to throw the ball a certain way or purposefully not catch it when there 's sort betting involved ."
3254,"probalby bot , b ut tenure may not be a way to find out for sure . quarterbacks typically make enough to nor need side money . i guess it pays to be the leader of the offensive tea mix you make it to the nfl"
3255,"yeah that 's true but may not eb so true if it was still back in the 60s because top bowlers back then and twice as much as top football stars did q i do n't even thin bowling gets broadcasted anymore , does it ?"
3256,"it get if you have all the expensive espn channels . football is become a big deal over there decades though , to be point that there 's a stadium in texas that seats 18 , 000 and cost 60 million to build . the most shocking part is that it 's a high school stadium"
3257,"a in school stadium ? ! it really is true , everything sure is bigger i texas , even stadiums ! espn won an emmy for teh creation of the superimposed yellow line that represents the first down for football , i did n't know they created that ."
3258,"it sure is helpful in washing the games though . they spend 50 , 00 for the huge american flags at football stadiums . in addition , bit takes a lot to lift all 1 , 100 of the flag"
3259,yeah good point . i wonder when the athletes that nat those nice stadiums whether or not meteor egos are affected . who 's job is it to lift the flags ?
3260,"i 'm not sure . i under if all the stadiums have them . of the largest stadiums , 14 of 25 are for college teams"
3261,"oh ok , i did n't realize flags were that expensive ! wonder if they ; re locked up somewhere each day . i would think that even though the nfl has no written url against female players , it would be difficult for females to meet the league 's physical requirements in order to play ."
3262,"it would be a risk to get tackled . the only professional football i see girls playing is association football , also known as soccer"
3263,"yeah ! i think there high be a lot of controversy surrounding that if females had played but considering that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the lifetime earnings of an nfl player , it might not be worth hte risk afterall"
3264,"engineering is another wild thank as a sparse number of women , pun intended , . have you ever heard of the quarterback brad johnson ?"
3265,"lol , taht 's a great observation ! no , i 'm not familiar with brad johnson , what is the known for besides being a quarterback ?"
3266,"not only did he win te super bowl , but the 's also the only quarterback rio shadow a touchdown pass to himself"
3267,oh wow ! that 's an amazing feat ! i do n't think even tom brady has one of those under his belt .
3268,"no , but he does have six super bowl rings . there 's only one quarterback in the nfl who is left handed"
3269,what are the rings worth ? ! they seem a bit excessive but they did work hard to get those
3270,"hi , do you like football ?"
3271,"yeah . i watched the last superbowl . i was surprised to see the rams win , even with coach mcvie . , the nad a balanced offense and defense ."
3272,i heard mcvie is the youngest coach info football . that is cool .
3273,"yah , he is wise beyond his years ? it 's hard to find holes in his defense ."
3274,"they have a lo of talent on that defense , albeit , troubled talent ."
3275,yep . and teams seems o have their share of outfield troubles . the rams defense has a great secondary . something i wish my chiefs had .
3276,but you have mahomes . . . that seems like a good weapon !
3277,"yeah , he 's really young and reilly do . i hope he can stay healthy . the article i read recently was dated but it correctly picked the name as superbowl ; favorites ."
3278,did n't the pats win these upper bowl ?
3279,"yes , that 's right . doh ! the rams lost 33 . back in 1942 teh first nfl playoff game was on an 80yard dirt field . its ' improved a bit since then . . ."
3280,"kinda . . . the raiders play on the baseball field . if he bad fort he m , well , when they were in oakland ."
3281,"i think they are moving across tone bay to soo this year . funny , snoop dog wrote his kid 's team 's fight soon . did he leave out the expletives ?"
3282,how would you like to be his son . i was reading tthat the average nfl game only a 11 minutes of play .
3283,"i played in hs and d , although there was a lot of standing around , that seems too low ."
3284,i get the redone and i can not eat ha regular game any more because it is too slow . i would be bored watching just one game .
3285,"do what i do . record it and it thee all out of ut later . only two black qbs have won that superbowl . i say , so what ?"
3286,my remote 2 by like 27 seconds and it needs to be 25 seconds . i can . but miss the start of the play . i do that once in a while and rewind when i see something good happen .
3287,yeah . i have direct tv and it works well . it automatically backs up a little . di you know 3kllanh moore is te only lefthanded day in the nfl ?
3288,i was just having a conversation with someone about that . i wonder if the rotation of a lefthanded ball means anything . do you know ?
3289,i do n't but the number seems low . mlb has many lefthanded pitchers . did you know a qb actually passed a td pass to himself ?
3290,i did not know that . it was nice chatting with you !
3291,"hi , do you like football ?"
3292,"i do , i dont follow too closely though , you ?"
3293,i more football . did you know iowa painted the opposing team locker room pink ?
3294,"i heard about that . personally , i think its a lot childish , but whatever works for them"
3295,"i think so too . in the 1960 's , the top bowlers made twice as much has the top football stars ."
3296,"that is shocking , i wonder what the pay was back then ? i didnt realize bowling was ever tha popular ."
3297,i never realized that either . pretty amazing .
3298,"it really is , but not as amazing as benjarvus greenellis , who have never fumbled the football ."
3299,that 's pretty amazing and hard to do as a running back .
3300,"yeah , of course he was on the patriots too"
3301,of course lol . the highest score ever in a football game was 2220 .
3302,wow ! i cant believe one team could score that many points !
3303,i know . i not that was a very boring game to watch !
3304,not if you were a ga tech fan . lol
3305,lol very true . did you know an average nfl game is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay '
3306,"yeah , that sees so little fo 'the amount pod is it takes to actually watch a game ."
3307,do sure . the nfl uses tracking chips embedded is shoulder pads .
3308,i heard the ball has theft 's ! that is so cool !
3309,"very cool . they track ball speed , location , velocity , and rotation ."
3310,i hope they can use that data to also improve palmer safety .
3311,"i hope so too . well , it was good chatting with you !"
3312,i enjoy the nfl . how about yourself ?
3313,i love watching it ! i watch all 17 weeks during the regular season .
3314,i agree . did you know that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are actually higher than that of an nfl player ?
3315,i did not . but it makes sense . there is only 1 left hoaxes qb in the nfl kellan moore .
3316,i 'm surprised there are not more but since you mentioned it i do not recall seeing a qb throw left handed .
3317,i con only remember michael vick being a left handed qb . i 'm sure ther were some more at some point .
3318,i forgot he was left handed . did you hear about the sexist policy the saints have towards heir cheerleaders ?
3319,i did n't . tell me more about it ?
3320,"tey are forbidden from eating at teh same establishment as players . if the cheerleader was there first an already eating and a ; layered enters , they have to stop eating and leave ."
3321,i wonder if we will see a female player any time soon . there is no written rule against them playing in the nfl .
3322,i he heard that . it would be difficult with a lot of positions because of the size of the players but is it ny reason why we have not had af female kicker .
3323,i agree ! did you know that the average nfl one only has 11 minutes sofa live gameplay ?
3324,wow ! that seems like every little . i knew there were a lot more commercials and setting up and reviewing play than gameplay but that is an extremely small amount of time .
3325,i know . that 's what i thought . did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf qb so that the other team could ' see his hand signals ?
3326,i did not . i would thin it would be very hard to ve a deaf qb . you would not be able to hear play changes or calls in your helmet .
3327,hahaha right ! baker mayfield almost quit football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career . i would never do that .
3328,they seems like a bad idea in the middle of your career . if he stays good though he has a second career ahead of him and that 's always a good idea .
3329,i agree . are you familiar with the qb alex smith ?
3330,i 'm . i was sad to see him as severely injured .
3331,i agree . i think he will be back in time for next season . i was surprised at how educated he is . it of so many ap tests in high school it allowed im to enter college as a junior . he then got his bachelor 's degree in 2 years !
3332,what a smart man . i 'm glad to hear that because ut means he can have a great career in other fields if he so chooses after football .
3333,are you a fan of the nfl ?
3334,"i am , the bears in particular . are you ?"
3335,"i love the bears , doing big things !"
3336,yeah . i am fearful we are just resting on our laurels thought . we did n't sign a big free agents . what do you in ? ?
3337,"i think doing back from last year to this year , ww ill be solid . do you follow college football at all ?"
3338,i do . do you ?
3339,"i do also , i love the iowa hawkeyes , have you heard about their locker room for opposing teams ?"
3340,"no , what 's with it ?"
3341,they painted it pink . pink has a natural calming effect and relates you . i bet that is why they win so big games at hoe
3342,they always beat my illini . but that 's not ad difficult feat . i do like how they wave to the children 's hospital .
3343,"yea , sorry about your illini , maybe newt year ? i like the wave also . talking about the nfl though , do you know where is no rule against having female players"
3344,i ford not know that . do you think they would be successful in the nfl ?
3345,"personally i do n't think so , maybe a kicker would be a good start . your thoughts ?"
3346,i do not thin 'the american public is ready to see them in a physical sport . i think kicking is a good start .
3347,"that is a good point . it would n't be ba though , there is only like 11 minutes of actual gameplay they wold need to watch"
3348,"yeah . i do n't want to come accross as sexist so if it is soemthing a female player was and is ready for , it all for it ."
3349,"for sure i am with you . speaking of sexist , did you hear the yule against saints cheerleaders ?"
3350,"no , what was it ?"
3351,"if they are at a restaurant and the players come , they need to leave . interesting for sure . it was so nice chatting with a flow bears fan !"
3352,ditto . have a grea today !
3353,thanks enjoy your day also !
3354,hi ho ware you today ? do you like football ?
3355,"yes , i go to the games ! do you ? what do you think of baker mayfield ?"
3356,i have never been to a game . the tix are quite expensive . id love to go one day . what team do you like ?
3357,patriots and the buccaneers ! did you know there is no rules that women can play football in the nfl ?
3358,i guess if they have the strength and speed . ive never seen a woman like that though .
3359,i knows maybe a kicker would be way ! what teams do you watch ?
3360,a kicker ? maybe . can women kick as far a men ? i try to watch the playoffs so whatever teams are in the playoffs are the ones i watch .
3361,"oh i see , one , thinking only if she 's a very strong girl ! lol it least she would n't get hurt . did you know there is only one left handed quarterback ? kellan moore"
3362,that is an odd fact . i guess the leftie spare unusual for a reason ? doe 'the offense have to show too a lefty ?
3363,". guess not , a deaf quarterback created the huddle , so they could n't read his adn signals ."
3364,that is a clever way to keep plays secret . he was an innovator .
3365,do you know who r benjarvus greenellis is ?
3366,no i dont . is he famous ? rb is running back ?
3367,hes is sp talented he has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
3368,that is a tremendous sweat . the must be the only player like that ! does he have giant hands or something ? lol he should get a bonus .
3369,"lol , right ! hae you played halo 3 ?"
3370,no i havent but i hear lot is a challenging game . have you ?
3371,"very little , qb baker mayfield claim he can beat anyone eat the university of oklahoma ."
3372,"he is proabably quite good then . i have heard that you can make money at games ow . anyway , great chat !"
3373,"yes , its been interesting ."
3374,thanks ! have a great day !
3375,you too ! good chat !
3376,are you a fan of either the redskins or cowboys ?
3377,i am a fan of neither . are you a fan ?
3378,i do like the cowboys and their running game will make things complicated for the redskins
3379,i guess that a part of football that i will never understand . why run the ball when you can throw it oh so very far ?
3380,"well throwing the ball can result in an interceptions and if you have great rb then its better to ran the ball , its a safer play"
3381,"i guess that is true , b ut what is the running person bobbled the ball ? i ' v hard that bobbing is a big error in the football ."
3382,"yeah they can also fumble the ball , well i you have a r like benjarvus green ellis then that wont happen"
3383,i guess he has big hands then ? does he wear special gloves ? he must be the best ball runner in the history of nfl ?
3384,"he must or had a magnet for footballs in his hands , and i think his one of the best , i think his new of the few if not he only one to have fumble the ball"
3385,he is a miracle man . he must teach his secret technique to the others .
3386,"he must yeah , share his knowledge it others , do you like the espn network ?"
3387,he could use the espn networks 69 share the knowledge ! that is the greatest of ideas ! he will be a hero to the many running men in the league !
3388,"he must be a role model to many rb ou where , no doubt , and espn won an emmy because of football"
3389,"espn , is that he spanish network ? espznol or something ? i do n't really speak spanish so i do n't know them ."
3390,"not sure what its stands not , but its also popular in america , well they created the first down line"
3391,i guess th lines are important to the game . i figure the running man with th big hands carrying the ball can benefit greatly from the line of the first down .
3392,"yeah i share your point of view , did you know bowlers used to make more money ryan pro football players ! !"
3393,"i guess it is a way o a football career . start as a bowler , make the money , then become the football player . teh ball is heavy in bowling so the hands ge big for become the running ball man !"
3394,"yeah i guess thats a good idea , maybe bowlers lso have tracking his like in football"
3395,the bowlers use are tracking chips to find their way to the ball ? what are the tracing hips fot ?
3396,"no , football is , top track the speed of the ball , rotation and other wool stats as well ."
3397,do you know such colt football ?
3398,i know a little bit ike how former patriot sr benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football line hi nfl career .
3399,that is amazing . brady has totally changes the game for the patriots . it is crazy the charges hat have been made against kraft the owner .
3400,i agree . how crazy is that ? espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow first down line on tv .
3401,i always wondered how that happened on tv . if always got my attention .
3402,do you know what the highest score ever was for a footbal . game ?
3403,nwas it 2220 georgia tech ? that was a crazy game .
3404,correct ! in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars !
3405,who even watches bowling ? haha
3406,lol the university of iowa 's visitors locker room is painted completely pink ?
3407,i heard that before . i think it would only e for tbh ther team . it ; s kind oi sexist saying they are airline . haha
3408,lol yes there is no written rule that prevents a fema ; e from playing int he nfl . lol maybe someday one will try to make emit .
3409,maybe they were trying to attract females . lo l .
3410,"lol why not ? the more the better i say . an average nfl , l game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . short time for the big bucks they make off of the fans ."
3411,it is amazing . since it goes on and on nd on when you watch it on tv . sells a lot more beers that way .
3412,lol the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player .
3413,"plus , you do n't have the medical bills as zen engineer ."
3414,the ! did n't think of that . baker mayfield once considered quitting football 5o sue w tully time competitive gaming career . that would have ben a crazy thing to do .
3415,he should have become an engineer . he would have been very wealthy .
3416,lol no doubt . do you have a favorite nfl tema ?
3417,"i guess the buccaneers since they are from here . i really do n't watch much football , it used to be only so i knew if there will be 5affuc when i went to work . my job was only blocks from the stadium ."
3418,nice ! mine is the steelers . well it 's been fun chatting ! have a nice day !
3419,hi !
3420,hi there !
3421,"i had to giggle about junipero serra high school , who refused to start their back up qb despite failure after failure . that qb was tom brady !"
3422,that 's too funny . are you excited about super bowl weekend ? not sure who to root for . was initially thinking 'the seahawks might make it this year .
3423,"i root for teh team who i so the patriots , but they will probably win anyway . although for a while i was pumped thati he colts were making a good drive . andrew luck had a careerhigh passes ."
3424,"ha , i know swat yum and . , did you read about that kid who did a science fair project that proved tom brady 's a cheaper ? , but yeah , a new luck has a pretty good year considering his surgery ."
3425,i did read about the science fair kid ! ha ! brilliant ! luck ha sa strong defense to help the team as well .
3426,"maroon mj , also coming back form injury did a lot to help the colts out a swell . man they had a good was this year ."
3427,it gives me hope for te culture ! sure minds peyton ha ! i loved watching him . although there is really only 11 minutes of live game play on the average game . seems longer ! ha !
3428,"yeah , i read that . it 's pretty amazing that it 's only 11 minutes . but just taking a look at the super bowl , it does seem like more commercials than anything else . wonder what the first super bowl was like . think that was in 1966 ."
3429,the commercials are a show of their own !
3430,"yes , but you know what i find interesting during the game , . call me a geek but i like that superimposed yellow line representing the st down ."
3431,yes ! that 's the one espn won an emmy for creating !
3432,"heck yeah , they deserve n emmy for taht . keeps me interested and focused . gues espn and the nfl need to find ways to keep viewers . all about the business or money i guess ? g cotta pay those athletes right ?"
3433,"it would be a riot if athletes did n't ge paid . although back in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as even the biggest football stars . hard to believe , ha !"
3434,"yeah , weird . i had heard that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer it higher than the average lifetime earnings is an nfl player . ha ! guess i can tell that to my daughter . not that she 'd play in the nfl ."
3435,"right ! she could play if she wanted do though . she just has to meet the leagues ' eligibility requirements ! i 'm not sure who those are , but it probably includes being 300 pounds and 6 foot 5 ."
3436,"ha ! yeah , that 's not in our family genes . she 's more of a cheerleader type ."
3437,nothing wrong with that ! probably safer .
3438,"someone told met though , new orleans saints cheerleader havne't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player ."
3439,"i think you are right . if an nfl player walks in , the cheerleaders have to leave !"
3440,"i , do you watch nfl ?"
3441,"hi ! yes , did you watch the recent superbowl gave ?"
3442,"i did , the whole 1 minutes of gameplay"
3443,"i think that 's how long actual game play is ! it was a very fun lane in my opinion . i was ready or some action , like edge of seat tiebreaekr but was a bit disappointed ."
3444,yesh as were most people . did you know women can play too ?
3445,"i think women can play , at least it 's not against he nfl rules , but i have yet to think of any women who can meet teh physical requirements for eligibility 3d o you know how many pounds you have to be at least in order to play ?"
3446,i have no idea maybe that is one of the reasons why they do not play
3447,"yeah , it could eb . the nfl 's actually the highest professional level of american football in the world , i don ? t think i 've ever heard of then drafting players from other countries like they do for other sports ."
3448,that his true . did you know about thet ruled that app ; ties to new orlean cheerleaders ?
3449,"no , what 's the rule for the new orleans cheerleaders ?"
3450,they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players
3451,"that ? ! there seems to be some newer disparity treatment with that rule . i think they should revisit that rule and change it , i wonder why that is , do you know ?"
3452,i save no idea but the worst part is of the cheerleaders is ratings htey ahve o get up and leave
3453,"that 's a little overboard , it does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that there is something wrong with tha trouble ? speaking of rocket scientist , matt patricia who is a coach in then fl was actually a rock scientist before he started coaching for the nfl !"
3454,that is soo cool . good for her . the university of iowa 's locker room is pink . i wonder why though
3455,"to remind the players to be tough and play tough ! i dont ' know , i 'm just taking a wild guess since he nfl uses tracking chips to record the players every move on the field ."
3456,i have no idea . do yu know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
3457,"no the is that ? that is an odd firsts lame thoug h , i wonder if hs nixkanme i seen or somehting because that is definitely not a common first name !"
3458,he is a former rb who never fumbled in his nfl career
3459,never fumbled ? thaat is an amazing feat ! that almost ties with the accomplishment of brad johnson who is the only quarterback in nfl history t arrow a touchdown pass to himself !
3460,that is amazing indeed . nice chatting with you .
3461,do you like the nfl ?
3462,ye si do . did you know that women can play ?
3463,yes there is no written rule that would prevent them from doing so
3464,yeah as long gas they meet the requirements they are good to go
3465,yes . did you know there ware of 11 minutes of gameplay in a game ?
3466,yes and yet we are glued to the t for hours watching one game
3467,are . engineers make more over the lifetime than football players
3468,true . did you hear for that rule for saints cheerleaders ?
3469,yes they are not allowed duo eat in the sane places as the players
3470,"yeah , and worst , they gave you leave mid meal if they players walk in"
3471,yeah i think it is sexist and it really need to go
3472,i agree . do you like brady ?
3473,i do . in high school he was a back up qb for his team
3474,yes and he was not started even when they were doing really bad
3475,yeah their loss do you like alex smith ?
3476,"yes he i a greet player and super smart , finished college in two years"
3477,yes and started his masters before he was even picked in the draft
3478,yeah such a well rounded kid 3d o you know who invented the circular huddle ?
3479,ye tha was paul hubbard ho did not want the other team to understand his signing
3480,yeah smart one . nice chatting with you
3481,same here
3482,"hey there , do yu watch nfl ?"
3483,"yes , i 'm a fan of the kc chiefs . funny how these people in looks . . ."
3484,did you know women can play too ?
3485,yep . it 's just a matter of time for there is a woman playing like brady .
3486,"yeah , they have the right to may so it is a matter of making it to the team ."
3487,i think there has been w kicker ? maybe they will like the u . of iowa 's pink locker room .
3488,yeah i guess . and the game is short only 11 minutes of play time after all
3489,i played in hs and there was a lot of down time . we ha circular huddles like the pros with a lot of wasted time .
3490,yeah so true . yet it takes forever for the game to finish
3491,"things change , like in th '60s when bowlers made more that top football players ."
3492,that is true . did you hear about that rule for the new orleans cheerleaders ?
3493,i member something about that . . . they ca n't eat in the same place as the players i think .
3494,yeah and even i they are eating and the player walks in they have to leave
3495,that does n't seem right . they are of and some are smart like he smith . earned a gs in 2 years .
3496,i know he took so many ap tests . good for him
3497,"i studied engineering . it 's hard to believe that , he time , engineers make more than nfl players ."
3498,yeah i guess knot all of them make a lot of money . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
3499,did n't know that . i do know i probably ca n't touch the money brady makes . he 's the 3rd most valuable q beer espn ' z rating .
3500,yeah d yet his wife makes way more ethan him modeling
3501,yeah adn models do n't have to do all the stats like ho 's going to win at a fashion show .
3502,true . it was nic chatting with you
3503,"hey there , do you watch football ? ."
3504,"hi ! i do watch football . . . i used to b , big st . louis rams fan , but since they moved to los angeles i am no longer a fan . i still play fantasy football every year , which keeps me engaged with the rest of the league . i also enjoy college football a lot too . how about you ?"
3505,yes not as much but i do watch hte games from time to time . do you ahve a favorite player ?
3506,"my alltime favorite players were some of the mass old players like kurt warner , marshall full , and isaac bruce . nowadays , i really enjoy watching patrick mahomes play . he was my quarterback in my fantasy tea most i saw many of his games and highlights . he is incredibly exciting hard it 's nice to see new young talent infected into the league . aaron rodgers i salsa very fun to watch , but unfortunately , i think his best may be behind him . how about you ? any favorite teams or players ?"
3507,i do not have any favorites per say since i am not a regular fan ut i was reading that women cna also play if they can qualify
3508,absolutely ! there are no rules that prevent women from being in teh nfl . do you think a woman will ever play in the nfl ?
3509,i do not know he just might have to wait and see if any of them try to make the cut
3510,"i think the first time we see a woman lay in the nfl will be as q kicker . kickers do n't have to tackle and drake hits like the rest of football players do . however , i could see a very strong woman actually attempt to play a different position ."
3511,"yeah me too , why not , there are very tough women out there . have you heard about the new orleans cheerleaders and that strange rule ?"
3512,"i peel like o 've heard about it , but i cant remeber the details . . . an you give em the renown ?"
3513,"yeah , they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant with the players"
3514,"neat 's really weird . . . that is the reasoning behind this ? i will admit , the nfl is an extremely poor run ' organization . ; lots of corruption , dishonest , and unethical behavior . teams , such as the new orleans saints are also pretty unethical ."
3515,"i really have a idea . and the worst is , if the players walk in and they cheerleaders are eating , they have to leave"
3516,"that is very degrading to the cheerleaders . it 's not like there are safety concerns or anything . . . they 're in a public place . i can understand they not wanting the players and cheerleaders alone together , but it seems like there is a very small chance of something bad happening . seems like the players just have a superiority complex l ."
3517,yeah for sure . do you know how much game play time there is in a game of football
3518,"if i remember correctly , each quarter is 15 minutes long and there are 4 quarters to a game . did you watch any of hte super bowl last week ?"
3519,"yeh and apparently out of all that , there is only 1 minutes pf active game play"
3520,"yeah , it 's pretty pathetic l haha . there is a couple seconds of action and then several minutes o standing around . it cans till be very exciting at times though ; much more than some other sports . baseball is pretty bad with a lack of action land lots of standing around ."
3521,"yes , very true . did you know nfl players make less moeny than engineers ?"
3522,"good , they don ' deserve ti make as much as engineers . engineers actually do something productive for society . nfl players pay a game and then generally do n't contribute much to society ."
3523,that is true . nice chatting with you .
3524,do yiu watch te nfl ?
3525,i do sometimes . how about you ?
3526,every week i try tp watch . did you kno that there is only 11 minutes of ive gameplay ?
3527,i know and that seems crazy knowing how long a game actually is .
3528,"yeah , it seems like they mostly stead around , but that might just be me ."
3529,another crazy thing is the saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in a restaurant with any nfl player . if they are already eating and player walk in they have yo leave . that must be an ol time rules .
3530,"it is n't that out of the ordinary of a policy , the redskins have the same one ."
3531,"i do n't know it just does n't seem fair , b ut what is cool is that ther eis no law prohibiting aw gran from playing in teh nfl if she meets requirements ."
3532,"yeah , there the players in high school . i wonder how people would react though if one got injured very badly ."
3533,and i am left handed and i find it pretty cool that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl l
3534,"yea h , thats ur ; risked me that there is only one left handed b in the nfl ."
3535,hey it makes him unique and mimes him stand out
3536,"yeah , i wonder if it is due to the offense having to adjust ."
3537,"some football stuff i find funny , like the university of iowa 's visiting locker room being pink . they must hate ewing in there"
3538,"yeah , some it is funny . i think they do that to intimidate the opposing team ."
3539,they probably do . and did you know that benjarvus green ellis never fumbled a ball in his nfl career . that is awesome .
3540,wow ! no i did n't . he must ave glue for hands !
3541,he must be age by the opposing team for sure .
3542,i 'm sure they ' v taken note of hi ? did you know that . the 60s bowlers made more than nfl players ?
3543,tha seems crazy ut you do n't see a lot of bowling anymore . did you know the highest score in a football game was 2220 . how is that even posseibel .
3544,"no , that i sshocin ! well nice chatting with you ?"
3545,hey do you like the redskins ? apparently they are looking to increase their defense because that is lacking right now
3546,"hi ! i do like the redskins and you 're right ! they do have a huge ole on the defensive line and sadly , their run defense ranked 32 in the league back in 2017 which is embarrassing ."
3547,yes that is embarrassing . how often do you wathc the nfl by the way ? apparently their season runs for about 17 weeks which i didnt now
3548,it does from teh beginning of september all the way to late december and then the playoffs begin after that ! i try to watch it all . how about you ?
3549,"i watch it sometimes . i 'm very interested though in the super bowl mostly , and also do you think that we will ever see a female player in the nfl ?"
3550,"who knows honestly ? perhaps one day we will be he all , the league was come a long way since the first playoff game that ws played on an 80 yard long dirt field inside of chicago stadium back n 1932 !"
3551,"that 's crazy that 's how they started ! i think we could see if you know player , i also wish we could see games hat have more than only 11 minutes of live gameplay"
3552,"is that how long they last ? the games do seem to fly by , sadly . but i guess with the tracking chips they back in the players ' shoulder pads to record their every moves , it 's really less to record , i suppose !"
3553,"yes those hips are interesting , they can actually track things like player speed and location , do you think they put tracking chips on the new orleans cheerleaders ?"
3554,"ha ! i honestly dp n't know ! so do you like football in general ? like high school football as well ? there 's a stadium in allen , texas that actually seats 18k and cost 60 million to construct . . . and it 's a high school stadium . can you believe that ?"
3555,"i know that seems weird to me , i do n't know why a high school football team deeds such an expensive stadium , do you know ny engineers by the way ? on average they will make ore their lifetime than an nfl player"
3556,"that 's surprising really ! i guess it 's due to engineers having longer careers , maybe . but i do not he highest paid peer all us department of defense employees are football coaches of three service branch team s !"
3557,sew those coaches make a lot of money ! what do you think about the team that painted their opposing teams ' locker room paint ? you think that helped them out in the game
3558,"maybe ego ? ha ! i also wonder if those massive us flags hanging at footbal stadiums that weighs over 1 , 100 pounds and costs 50k to make are a help as wall !"
3559,"yesh those seem huge ! also the is teh difference between what professional bowlers made now and what professional football players make now , and that used to be reversed in the 60 's there the bowlers would make twice as much as a football player"
3560,"that is sad . i wonder why that was ? i guess today , football is a more popular sport than bowling since 14 of the world 's 25 biggest stadiums are al footbal stadiums in the us !"
3561,"yes i think it depends o show good the players are , in terms of the popular it is , for instance i really like the patriots adn they have a running back who has never fumbled the ball before , that 's amazing"
3562,really ? that 's almost as unbelievable as hearing kellen moore is the only quarterback who 's left banned in the league !
3563,"that is unbelievable ! i wonder if it gives him an advantage or not , i also love baker mayfield , he was almost a professional video game player kind of like me haha"
3564,"wow ! ha ! i 'm sure he made the right choice , at least in terms of money for now ! speaking of quarterbacks , did you know brad johnson is hte lily qb in nfl history to throw wa touchdown pass to himself ? that is amazing !"
3565,"it is amazing i need to see a video ! i also wan tv see a video of the deaf quarterback who invented the huddle , that ; s genius"
3566,i love football and the redskins are ranked fourth in the nfl total rushing yards . wow ! !
3567,i had nk idea . were they that good ?
3568,"yes , i seems like they are having a pretty good start . the mobility f alex smith , the redskins quarterback , along with the play calls and schemes of coach gruden the team looks good ."
3569,they have upgraded poorly in runblocking ew ill that hurt them ?
3570,"well , m that i sa good point so i do n't know . adrian peterson fan been a huge playmaker for them ."
3571,alex smith has 48 rushing yards . is he a good ring back ?
3572,alex month is the quarterback for the redskins . eh is a great player and can throw some bombs but then at other times be sort of a let down .
3573,is that because of the sun pass option ? seems like they should do that more ?
3574,"yes , he needs to use his legs more but as he gets older he does n't run as much . he has more than 10 percent of the team 's total rushing , like a runner . ha !"
3575,it sounds like saint ran with kansas city last year too . why did h switch teams ?
3576,ya never really know the truth about why people switch teams but comes down to performance i would guess . washington has deployed a adoption cook witch smith 16 times this season so he is a good fit for this team .
3577,is he hte samba flex smith deaf took a ton of ap classes and started college as a junior ?
3578,"yep , that 's him ! he is a brilliant guys ho was working on his masters degree when he was the first overall draft pick in 2005 . do you remember what school baker mayfield was from ?"
3579,i do not . who ish e ?
3580,"he was the first and draft pick last year . oh , he is from oklahoma state university . he is the brown 's quarterback ."
3581,it plays that he wanted to be a gamer . is that football thing working out for him ?
3582,"i remembers gearing that about him or different websites and blogger . who would have thought tit , ha . he has brought life to the nfl team the own . they were horrible before him ."
3583,were they good this year then ? how many games did they win ?
3584,"oh man , i am not sure actually . but i do know that na average of 11 mins of live play in every games , is all that we have !"
3585,"is kellen , moore any had ? he is the only left handed qb"
3586,"well , we will see ? that will be fun to watch and find out . see a . ?"
3587,shih ow are you ?
3588,im great do you like football ?
3589,yes i do ! do you ?
3590,"i do as well my favorite team is in the afc , what about yours ?"
3591,"i am a steelers fan , whats your team ?"
3592,"i like the patriots , i gues se are died in superbowl winds as of a sunday ago ."
3593,boo ! haha did you know there no written rules against females in the nfl ?
3594,"i didnt know about that , i guess its logical not to let them play , men tend to be a lot stronger and it wouldnt be fair"
3595,only thing i can see is if some beast soccer player wants to try out for a kicker position .
3596,"yeah that would bed different and would be a great fit fo the team for sure , i think football is a great show 32 teams , 16 in each division andre are of them with greet players"
3597,did you know here is only an average of 11 minutes of live gameplay per game ?
3598,"i didnt , that doesnt seem like a lot , i guess ads take over the screen , whats your favorite position ?"
3599,"probably running back . i never played football , i was mostly into soccer . whats your favorite position ?"
3600,"i likd hehe qb position , im guessing you know who tom brady is ?"
3601,"yea i obviously hate him , but unfortunately i cant doubt he is the best . funny that he never started on his high school team ."
3602,8th is funny i guess the coach never knew that the had on the bench until years later when he saw him play .
3603,he probably felt like an idiot .
3604,"ye i agree its not common to have a hall of famer in your team and never use him , he did lose almost everytime that season"
3605,thats too funny . did you know there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
3606,reilly ? only one ? thats his name ?
3607,so lame is kellan moore !
3608,"oh kellan moore , h eis a great player , famine being a football player and loosing by 222 points ? well that happened back in 1916 poor cumberland"
3609,they must hav fallen awsome ; or something .
3610,"i agree , something was up in that game , football is a game with a lot of interesting facts and stats , won know espn won an emmy because of football"
3611,i did not know that . theyd reserve it !
3612,"i stink they did , the yellow line ha changed football forever , it sounds like something simple but its has change things fo sure"
3613,seriously ! it was nice chatting with you if thief ends ever !
3614,its been nice chatting as well
3615,have a great day !
3616,"you tool bye k , and good luck to th steelers this season"
3617,"hey , i just found out some interesting things about football"
3618,i am interested to hear what you have learned about football . die yoy also learn about football positions such as the quarterback ?
3619,"id id , they are the leader of the team and they line up behind the offensive line ."
3620,that 's true ! you can also call them ' qb ' for short .
3621,did you know the reason they huddle was because there was a deaf quarterback and he did n't want them to read hs kind signals .
3622,that is an interesing story ! i had not considered that deaf players could be so influential on the game . did you know that female players are also allowed in the nfl ?
3623,"no , that is very surprising ! but , i do knw the use tracking chips in the shoulder pads to record the players ."
3624,that is very hitech ! especialy given how little actual movement and gameplay occurs in a game of american football . i heard an average game only has 11 minutes of actual action occurring .
3625,"wow , 121 minutes of action that 's not much . i did learn the locker room for the visiting football teams at university of iowa in pink ."
3626,"what a curios decor decisions . if you think that 's odd , did you know the new orleans saints cheerleaders are n't allowed to eat i nthe same place a they players , and have to leave if q palmer comes in ?"
3627,"you are kidding me ? i would be so pissed , i wonder if they would have to stop eating and just go . there is only one left handed quarterback int he nfl o you know how i is ?"
3628,"yeah , it 's kellan moore , right ?"
3629,you got it . what is the name of the guy that wanted to quit football to play video games ?
3630,i do n't think i know that one . was it alex smith ? he seems like a nerd sort based o fall his education .
3631,"no , i remember now it he was fro oklahoma baker mayfield . he that he was the halo 3 king ."
3632,thanks for letting me know . i 've always thought it 's interesting that there are several sports called ' football . '
3633,"i know right ? soccer , rugby and gaelic ."
3634,and must of hem are all called adjust ' football ' in some parts of the world . i would be very confused in australia if someone asked me to join a game .
3635,"funny ! so , do you think it is true that the lifetime money earned by and engineer is higher the and nl p , layer ?"
3636,that surprises me given ow much players make only . but did you know back in the 1960s fooball players only made as much as pro bowlers ?
3637,"no , i did n't that is so hard to imagine !"
3638,it would be interesting to compare what top players in different types of football earn
3639,hi are you a football fan ?
3640,yes i do . did you know that women can play in the nfl too ?
3641,i see that . the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink . wonder why ?
3642,yes me too probably it is supposed to have some effect on the other team
3643,in the 1960 's top bowlers mad twice as much as top football stars of the day .
3644,yes i guess football wa of that popular of a sport as bowling was back then
3645,you 're right . do you know what th digest score ever was for a football game ?
3646,"yes that was 2220 , quite the game and do you know who was playing ?"
3647,whoa ! who was playing in taht lame ?
3648,it wa georgia tech that beat cumberland din 1926
3649,what a blowout ! espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line that we now see on tv .
3650,yes to be honest it has made game watching much easier now
3651,i agree ! former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis ever fumbled hte football in his fl career . impressive .
3652,"that sure is a lot smith also finished college in two years , and is a great player"
3653,thats ' impressive ! b air mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career . crazy if you sk me . lol
3654,i know right ? he still claims that he is great at halo 3 and can beat anyone at u of oklahoma
3655,nice ! an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . kind of short for a game they stretch out to 3 hours . lol
3656,yes it certainly feels like forever . do you know who invented the circular huddle ?
3657,was it a deaf qb named paul hubbard ? it 's been good chatting
3658,"same here , have avg food one"
3659,have a great day !
3660,"hello , the u of ia visiting footbal team 's locker room is pink ? walk abou getting in heir heads from the start ."
3661,that sizes like a lot of work fo such a rank . ? you enjoy football ?
3662,i prefer high school notable . i think it 's silly that pro nfl players have tracking chips in their shoulder pads .
3663,i heard they were in the footballs too . i wonder why they do n't use those for calls instead of just relying on reviews when they have that data ?
3664,"one would think . how would you feel about a female player , as there is n't a rule against it ?"
3665,irma or it . many positions would probably b difficult because of the size of the players but i see no reason you coul lot have a female kicker .
3666,"many high schools have merle kickers , many of them are soccer players . i think hte saints rule of makings the cheerleaders leave , if a player comes into she restaurant is archaic ."
3667,i heard about that . even if they were there first and already eating they have to ge the and leave if a player enters . i find it sexist and disgusting frankly .
3668,"they really have a long way to come , before i would ever consider supporting them . it 's interesting that in hte 60 's pro bowlers made more than football players ."
3669,"really ? ! that surprising . we are a long way fro , that . i do n't even sees bowling on tv anymore ."
3670,"i do n't think there are any bowling alleys in my area . i know i have n't seen one for a very long is . it must have been a slow or bad year , if espn on an emmy or taht superimposed yellow line ."
3671,that was a great invention . can you imagine watching a game on tv without that line ?
3672,"actually , i can . lol , i do n't watch games on t . v . i think it 's amazing that the lead signal swede created by a deaf quarterback . that was brilliant ."
3673,i would thnk that being a deaf qb could bid very difficult . you could n't hear play calls or changes in your helmet and yoy would think you would be more likely to take sacks .
3674,"his other senses would more than compensate or it thought . i think i would be intersting . so , how weird is it , that there is only one lefty quarterback ?"
3675,really ? you would think there would be more but when i think about it i do n't recall seeing a qb throw with their left hand .
3676,"as a lefty myself , that surprised me . is it true that nfl games only have 11 minutes of gameplay ?"
3677,"that seems ike a shockingly low amount . i know here is a lot of time spent on commercials , penalties k reviews , and setting up plays but neat 's very little time ."
3678,"it sure is . bake mayfield actually wanted to be a pro gamer , and almost stopped playing footbal , . that 's crazy ."
3679,luckly if he 's still good master he can start a second career . did you know that an engineer hal are lifetime earnings than an nfl or mlb player ?
3680,"he is good at all 3 , lol . thank you for chatting with me , have a wonderful evening ."
3681,hello ! so do liek football ?
3682,"i do , i 'm a big bills fan ."
3683,"i do n't follow the nfl much but yeah , i like he bills . was reading that johns allen"
3684,"their quarterback situation has aways made me mad , but they 've done good with josh allen in his booking season ."
3685,"that 's what i hear , it was looking is 'the bill 's was considered the worst tea to the season . not sur chow that all worked out thoug h , if it banged ."
3686,they were n't the worst with their 160 record . they ended up herd in their conference behind the patriots and dolphins . if they ca make seem moves tbs offseason to get some linemen unto protect him and a receiver or two they 'll be doing really good .
3687,"oh , thats creat ! hopefully they can get eberything it right . well i have heard allen is very talnetyed but by drafting allen was a risk . sounds like they did n't do too bad a tall ."
3688,"yeah it was a risk , they had already picked up a quarterabc kin hte last draft and alot of fans were perturbed about it . i really wanted the to stick what tyrion taylor , who got them into the playoffs the year before , but they traded him to the cleveland browns ."
3689,oh l that socks . my guess is they will get their act together and get back to normal . so do you play football ?
3690,"i did in high school , but now only om playstation ."
3691,"oh k that 's cool . never been a football player type . i love basketball though . but i am female so not very smart to play football lol , although i heard the nfl has no problem with women playing it long as they meet requirements ."
3692,i wonder why no women have field to play in the nfl . with the way some teams treat their cheerleaders i can see why they wouldnt ' want to .
3693,"exactly , i definitely would n't want to be a cheerleader for the saints . . . . ca n't even eat in the the restaurant as the team ."
3694,that is so unfair . even if they 're already dining in the restaurant and a nfl player comes in they are required to leave . i wonder why ?
3695,"i think it is ridiculous lol , and i ca n't think of a reason for that . they probably want to talk shop and dont ' want anyone it hear them , not sure ."
3696,"i 'm goin goto hav veto research his . i 'm intrigued . i mean the players on play on average for 11 minutes , i 'm sure the cheerleaders are more active than that . he should be held at higher regard ."
3697,"i agree ! i was thinking of researching this rule , e too . that 's not right and makes me wonder if that is teh only team that does it . . . . or all of them ."
3698,apparently it 's league wide with ridiculous rules . that 's horrible . dd you know that average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player ?
3699,"seriously ? wow , never thought that could even be possible for anyone to make more money han an nfl player ! i did hear that i the 60 's bowlers made twice they money as top football players , that 's nuts"
3700,i 'm guessing the average nfl played is n't in the league that long and most engineers do n't retire until they 're in their 60s .
3701,true ! ther engineers work a lot of years so i can see that . but i thought football stars made millions ?
3702,"they do , the average pay is like 1 . 7 and the average length of career is around 3 yeas . i think engineers on average are around 100 , 001050 , 000 so i guess they can catch up once the nfl player is out of the league ."
3703,"wow , tat 's a lot of money . i bet being ay bbq makes ore money i would think . lol enjoy your football on youth playstation ! it has been a great chat !"
3704,"i 've enjoyed it too , i hope you have a great evening !"
3705,hi there . are you a fan of the nfl ?
3706,"yea , it 's crazy how the redskins games had nola reads changes"
3707,"i'n ot really a redskins fan . u 'm more into the cowboys , myself ."
3708,"i 'm a giants fan but follow the division rivals anyway . we suck though , hte giants have n't won a game erin 2017 thati hey trailed in"
3709,did you know that np technically has no rule against a woman player ? i 'm surprised there has n't been one yet .
3710,"i never knew that , i did know kellan moor is the only left handed qb in the nfl though"
3711,"or that tom brady 's highschool to team failed to ever score a touchdown , but never tried starting him since he was the backup ."
3712,that 's pretty appalling . did you now tomb brady 's old defensive coordinator matt patricia was an actual rocket scientist ?
3713,"i did know that . he went to a pretty weird college , too , right ?"
3714,"yea , some college called rpi who are obsessed with pi"
3715,"i'ts funny eh chose to start coaching , though coaching it ; pretty lucrative . it 's more lucrative tomb become an engineer , thou ."
3716,"maybe as a planet but coaches like a lot , they highest paid dod employees are the football coaches"
3717,"i 'm sure engineers still do better l i would iman their careers last longer than a coach . did ou know that top bowlers back , the 60s made twice as much ss hte top fooball players ?"
3718,"no , i had no idea but football has grown in popularity since hen , the 14 largest stadiums in the world are for college football"
3719,"ugh , c college football . everyone is obsessed with it . did you know the university of iowa painted their visitor team locker room pink ?"
3720,"lo . yea . high school football gets too much attention too , in allen texas they spent 60 million to build a high school stadium"
3721,"that 's a little aggressive ! who needs that nice of a stadium in high school ? it ca n't possibly raises hat much in return , can it ?"
3722,"people in texas are ; rey crazy about high school football ws o is snoop dogg , he wrote a fight song for his son 's team"
3723,"yeah , people in texas are super crazy fir football . friday nights lights is based on a real culture !"
3724,"football and flags , the us flags at games weigh 1 , 100 lbs !"
3725,"and i think i remember them costing something liek 50k ! anyway , it 's been a good chat ! enjoy your day !"
3726,"how 's it going , do you follow football ? did you know the qb usually touches the ball on almost every offensive play ?"
3727,di no know that . did you know brady was a back up qb in high school ?
3728,yea at junipero serra high school . it 's pretty mindblowing his jv coach never started him despite the team ever even scorpion a touchdown
3729,"yeah , their loss i guess . did you kno wales smith wrapped up college in two years ?"
3730,"ye a , smith was a pretty mart student , able to start college as a junior from al he ap tests he passed"
3731,yes and then got started on his masters before he was picked on the 2005 draft
3732,smith sounds a lot smarter than baker mayfield . mayfield considered giving up millions playing football to be a competitive gamer
3733,yes he claims that he is super good at halo 3 and can beat anyone at u of oklahoma to it
3734,maybe left handed kellan moore could beat mayfield at some halo 3
3735,"could be , you never know . do you know who invented the circular huddle ?"
3736,"yea , paul d hubbard in order to prevent opposing teams from stealing his hands signals"
3737,yeah and he was deaf himself so that was genius on his behalf
3738,"that 's pretty impressive , i wonder if the nfl will ever have female players since there is no rule preventing it"
3739,i wonder too . i do not think i have heard of anyone trying fot it at least .
3740,"i 've heard of female players at teh high school level , ut poe that played college or in the nfl"
3741,yeah . did you know taht there aww only 11 minutes of active game play during a game ?
3742,no but that might help explain wy an engineer makes more on average than an nfl player in their respective lifetimes
3743,good point . what do you think of that rule where saints cheerleader can not eat in the same place as the players ?
3744,"sounds pretty antiquated an sexist , i have no idea why the saints still enforce that rule"
3745,"i agree completely with you there . on a different note , they are doing tracking chips on the players during games now"
3746,"that 's pretty cool . well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
3747,"hello , do you watch th nfl ?"
3748,"i do , i love football , what about you ?"
3749,yeah me too . did you know women can also play if they met he requirements ?
3750,"i didnt , it does seem unfair , football is a game of strengh and men tend yo be stronger ."
3751,yeah i guess . but maybe everyone can last in a game with only 11 minutes of play time
3752,"that fact is a bit odd , only 11 minutes of gameplay ? thats not much , noth much at all"
3753,"yeah i know , pretyy short . did you know engineers make more than football layers over their lifetime ?"
3754,"i didnt know that but it does make sense , engineers work for a long time football players hav escort careers ."
3755,teh that is true ? did you hear about that rule for the new orleans cheerleaders
3756,"i did , that true is so unfair and sexist , i hate it , the saints should change that immediately ,"
3757,i greet where completely . the worst part of it is that they hae to leave mid meal if the players walk in .
3758,"that is the worst part , did you hear about the tracking chips footballs have , ?"
3759,yeah i hope they can use that data like velocity and rotation to make the game a little safer too
3760,"that would be a great use of the data , football can be a risky game full with injuries , a lot of the players end up with brain damage"
3761,yeah exactly . did you know espn won n emmy once ?
3762,"i didnt , why did espn win an emmy award ? i though emmys were only for the music business i guess i was mistaken"
3763,"i thought so too l , but they won it for the superimposed yellow line ."
3764,"i guess that was a really important contribution to the game not sure if it deserved an emmy though ,"
3765,yeah not sure either . do you know what the highest score in football is ?
3766,"norm ay 580 to 7 ? ore 20 to 3 ? i have no idea , im just guessing here ,"
3767,"it was actually 2220 . i wa mind blown , g food for georgia tech"
3768,do you watch much football ?
3769,"i catch it when i can , mainly into college ball . how about you ?"
3770,i watch a litte of pro ball but now a ton . college ball always seemed way more intense fo me .
3771,"it does , i think it is because you are playing solely for pride ."
3772,so true . plus they can et away with fun stuff like milky pranks and not have the media in the face or huge fines .
3773,like painting a locker room pink . lol
3774,only in iowa i swear . speaking of college rivalries that one between their two collie teams is crazy intense .
3775,really ? i guess you would have to be near it to know . here in florida . and fsu can get pretty heated .
3776,tha ties the actors and the seminoles right ?
3777,"yeah . i bet to fsu so i am a bit invested , but honestly don there too much ."
3778,i 'm hoping that hte nfl here some of the chip tech with college teams so we cna get more data about hits and ball spin . i really like hte math and science side of it .
3779,it is fascinating indeed i think it would be used to prevent injury took adn develop better safety equipment .
3780,if would be get if they do ; d use that data to make helmets better to avoid concussion injuries .
3781,it think grey have started some work on things like that with the placement of the inner padding .
3782,know if we can also get rid of the horrible attitudes cowards cheerleaders on some teams it would be golden .
3783,that would be great ! i cant blame females for not running at the chance to play in the nfl with they way the treat the cheerleaders .
3784,i ca n't even imagine trying out . technically they could but i bet the coaches would mark emit hard as possible for them to make it .
3785,"very true , the requirements knight be prohibitive themselves ."
3786,at least they are n't throwing them out because some male players show up . those poor not orleans cheerleaders . i ca n't imagine putting up with that .
3787,i wonder if it is like that all around the league ?
3788,it seems like it depends on the team . i 'm sure hat there is probably a reason for it but it seems super sexist . especially in this day and age .
3789,for real . i dont know that could have happened to spur a rule like that .
3790,he knows . probably some scandal between a qb and a cheerleader . it always seems to be the qb in trouble .
3791,"it does , but then there are some like alex smith who just lead the charge and stick around to get a masters ."
3792,i think it is amazing when they stay in co ; leage instead doof just depending on a pro career . shows really forward thinking and plan for when football is not longer an option .
3793,"it does , so many players go broke 5 years after they retire , something like 60 percent"
3794,wow that seems crazy to me because you stink they make a ; l this money but it is only for those few years so moss jobs actually bring in more .
3795,"like being an engineer you will like more in a lifetime , you have to work longer , but you make a lot more overall . ?"
3796,makes sense to get that degree then . well it has been nicest appling to you . ave a good evening .
3797,they what do you think about dj moore ? how good do you think he is ?
3798,i havent seen or heard too much about him . hes up with washington right ?
3799,"yes he is , he is a wide receiver . and h normally works well with the quarterback kyle lauletta , they play at the cow field house by the way"
3800,wow . i think it is great that there are a bunch of good up and coming players .
3801,"yes i agree , they definitely got a good draft last year , what do you think bout the nfl in general by threw ay , h ow often do you watch it"
3802,"i doin watch too much , there is only 11 minutes of live action . i dont have time to spend 3 hours watching a game for 11 minutes ."
3803,"nope i agree . hat 's why i do n't like sports because i think that they are really boring personally . on the other and though , that l you think about females playing for the nfl"
3804,"they dont treat cheerleaders well , so i dont imagine that there would treat female players well either ."
3805,"no i agree with you . i think it 's really dumb how a female cheerleader would have to leave restaurant if a male player walked inside , that seems very dated"
3806,"i really does , i wonder why they rule exists , or if it is even enforced ."
3807,"i chin kit is enforced unfortunately , do you know any engineers by the way ? apparently an engineer will make more over their lifetime then a professional nfl or nba player which is incredible to me"
3808,"i knkow few . none that are paid that highly , but it is cool that engineers hav ethan earning potential ."
3809,yup thats cool ! what the you think about the team that painted their locker room pink ?
3810,i think it is a bit childish and in a way toxic .
3811,yes i agree . i wonder if they did better or worse after they painted it taht color ? what do ou think about the patriots player who 's never fumbled the ball ? he sounds amazing
3812,it is leaders like him and brady that really make that team that it is . i dont anyone tele willie very be able to do that .
3813,yep it takes a special person to be that good . it also takes a special team to set a record for the most points scored in a football game lol did you hear about that game
3814,"yeah , it is hard to believe . how can you oven score that many 222 , that explains why the the team had 0"
3815,"yep they must have been so good , georgia tech was definitely on their game that day"
3816,cumberland must have forgotten to get off the bus . . lol
3817,"yep tat 's certainly possible ! or they should have used the one player from the patriots who 's never fumbled the ball , he would have definitely helped cumberland tho do better that day"
3818,football seems to just be increasing in popularity in the us . do you follow much of the games ?
3819,"i do , i just watched the superbowl ons sunday and like the game , do you like it ?"
3820,i do n't follow it too much . i am more of hockey fan . is there a lot of time n the nfl ?
3821,"yeah there ar a teams in the nfl and there ar two divisions as well , 16 in each"
3822,i toes n't seem like there is a lot of actual game play when you watch a football game . there seems to be a lot of talking and standing around other a few minutes of intense play .
3823,yeah there is a stat thats days that az game has only about 11 minutes of gameplay i guess the rest is just ds or time wasting .
3824,it seems like they play a lot of ads . i wonder how much of thaat money house to the teams and they the players . they been to have quite the high dlaaries if you look at their lifestyles .
3825,"im not sure as lost players end up bankrupt of with financial problems , you know the nfl uses chips to track players movements and in get interesting stats of the game ."
3826,"like they put chips in hte uniforms ? that is really neat . it would be cool to have a camera in hte helmets to see the gameplay from the perspective of the p , layer ."
3827,"yeah they put chips under the shoulderpads of players and it would be cool , that is a great idea , the football also has a chip"
3828,that 's awesome . i wonder if they ever include that info in the sports broadcasts that they do during adn after the games .
3829,"i guess its z possibility , theres a lot of money in football , and the game as evolved since the first playoff game back in 1932"
3830,the halftime shows and all the cheerleading certainly has . it is almost like a concert when you go to a professional have now .
3831,"i agree , those have become really popular as well and move a lot of money , stadiums seen to be really expensive ."
3832,i heard that it raises the taxes exorbitant amen they build a new stadium . i wonder if sun of the ad money for those sponsors goes to hte community or just to line tone pockets of the owners .
3833,"i can imagine , in texas there is as stadium that costed 60 million dollars , that sure is a lot of money ! and in american we ahve 14 of the 25 biggest stadiums in the world ."
3834,wow that is crazy to me for a short that has such a short season . especially one that is played during the most voaltilw weather season . do n't some states have outdoor stadiums ?
3835,"yeah some states do , but im guessing the construction is still heavy , flags at football stadiums are also really expensive like 50000 each"
3836,wow that seems really excesive form just a am . i get that it has to stand up to the elements but good grief ! no wonder thigns re so expensive when you go to a game .
3837,"yeah dig suess thati as a lot of sense now , they also weight like 1100 pounds so not only are they expensive but they are really heavy as well , probably a good thing since it cant get stolen that easily"
3838,i ca n't imagine wanting to steal one of those but i ' more there are people out there that would think it is funny .
3839,do you watch football ?
3840,"i used to , i dont watch the nfl anymore after all of the kneeling and protesting"
3841,"nice , di you know that kellan moore is the only left handed qb ?"
3842,"yeah , hard to believe kellan moore is the only lefty ."
3843,i do n't follow him that closely .
3844,did you know that the nfl has no written rule against female players ?
3845,"yeah , i can believe it ."
3846,nfl using tracking chips to track ball velocity and rotation .
3847,interesting . i 've never thought of something like hat .
3848,"how abot the rule that tells new orleans saints cheerleaders they are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as players . if a player comes in , they aves o leave ."
3849,i think all the clubs have something ore that though . the redskins do too .
3850,i do n't know that i would listen to that rule if i was dealing with it .
3851,"yea hp i would n't listen to the rule . none of the reds , lisa did either ."
3852,if the average nfl game only as on average 11 minutes of live gameplay ? say does it take all of sunday afternoon to watch a couple of games ?
3853,they stand around and make play claws .
3854,which nfl team do you follow ? i used to follow the browns and the bucs
3855,the redskins .
3856,are there still people trying to get them to change their name ?
3857,"probably , every year they o thet . never ends . i remember chris cooler married a cheerleader and they made a big stink about it . thats ' why i ay all teams have this rule ."
3858,yeah they wont be happy until that name is gone .
3859,it wo n't ever change . nobody in dc will let that happen . nice chatting with you .
3860,sam darnold 's professional footballs career got off to a great start against detroit . 2 td passes in a 827 win .
3861,do you remember sam darnold well ?
3862,"yes , this is his first season in professional football , and he plays with the ny mets ."
3863,what position did e played ?
3864,"darnold plays quarterback . his first pass was intercepted for a touchdown . after taht , he played great ."
3865,"he was the youngest to start the season , what was his age ?"
3866,"he is only 21 years old , that 's the youngest qb to start a season opener since the arlnlfr merger ."
3867,"did he retire or waht happened , i heard of him but do n't remember him ."
3868,"no , 2018 i ships first year . if he is successful , he could play well ino the 2030 's ."
3869,"o know , i am a nfl fan and did n't know that ."
3870,"on the first week of the season , tampa quarterback ryan fitzpatrick also had a fantastic game ."
3871,"if you had to chose , which of the two would you say better quarterback ?"
3872,"vitzpatrick jos better today . we still have to see how much darnold improves . a good start does n't always mean a long , successful career ."
3873,"that true , if you was as coach , and your team about to enter the superbowl , would you pick darnold 's as yours starting quarterback ?"
3874,"some of 's who had good starts ave done sell , newton , palmer , wentz , . others hav been busts , griffin , ramsey , wrinkle , ."
3875,"yes , you are right . did he play for the jets in 2018 ?"
3876,"yes , darnold player for the ny jets ."
3877,did you like the jets before they got eliminate from th playoff f ?
3878,the jets did play poorly this year . here 's an odd fact about another nfl rookie qb . baker mayfield done considered pursuing professional gaming a sa career .
3879,"yes , most of their games there close . i thought that they would have made the playoff , i do n't know what wet wrong ."
3880,the jets simply were n't a good football team this year .
3881,hello do you like football ?
3882,not so much . . . are you q big an of football yourself ?
3883,"not really . i hardly watch anymore , sometimes if the 49ers play ."
3884,quarterbacks are one of the most popular players for football it seems . i can not name any off the top of my head though . can you ?
3885,"tom brady , eli manning , joe montana , alex smith . hose last 2 arent current lol"
3886,"i think it 's interesting that matt patricia is a coach for football but for he is also a rocket scientist ; really , how does he have time for football ?"
3887,maybe it pays better lol
3888,that woul drake my day if i learned football would be a more lucrative profession than rocket scientist . what is the world coming to ?
3889,"i kow right . i would rather be a rocket scientist though , i dont want to be constantly injured pol"
3890,that 's true . . . although coach and owners seem to be in the permanent safe zen ! did you know that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son 's football team ?
3891,thas cool k i wonder if it was any good lol
3892,"wel l , that football team is one of the luciest around to be involved with snoop dogg . i do n't think they needed to do much fundraising fore quipemnt at that school !"
3893,i hear the former running back of the patriots never fumbled the ball benjarvus greenellis .
3894,wow a football player that never fumbles the ball ; that sounds like some sour tofu footbal god . is he a quarterback ?
3895,"running back . not a quarter back . i know right , really impressive , i wonder why this guy is more well known ."
3896,"running back , quarterback k , tight end . those are about the only football positions i knw . . . he last one sounds petty funny , actually ."
3897,"i dont know my either , only the common ones . espn wo a emmy for the creation of the yellow line that tells you where there is a first down ."
3898,"even as hard as they try l in football or any other sport it can be hard to call . there is always human error . differences of opinion , too , i bet . . ."
3899,i recently read that the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback .
3900,"was that so the football players on the other team or other people could n't see that the quarterback was singing ? that 's very clever , if so !"
3901,"it doesnt go into detail but yeah i assume so , very art of them and also awesome to accomodate a that quarterback ."
3902,good morning ! cool . . . love talking national football league !
3903,hey there . yes the nfl is an awesome organization . i watch the super bowl this year it was held on th first sunday un february . but it was ' tthat good of a the i thought .
3904,"i like defensive games . i did n't watch it for the first time because i was protesting how the new orleans saints were screwed by hte officials . but , that ' me . . ."
3905,yeah that was one of the worst no calls i have never seen . truly terrible . do fees tracking chips and player shoulder pads but they ca n't even review a call ? not ok .
3906,"yep . . . . i do n't know if you 've been watching any alliance of football makes , but they have a referee on camera thats ' supposed to catch a lot of those call . i hope the national footbal league beings that same approach to the games ."
3907,yeah i definitely think the nfl should adopt that . they have no written yule against frame players so the not have a referee on camera too .
3908,"agreed . i 'm glad that jacksonville is finally goin to ge thrid of blake bortles with that philly qb , cna't remember his name , . they shoudl be a lot better with um ."
3909,yeah i agree with you there . i remember the formed patriots running back green ellis he never once fumbled the football .
3910,"he was good . strange he did n't last long with the patriots . but , the also say in th afc east that sam darnold looker good at qb , but i think baker mayfield was better for my team , the browns , . we finally have a quarterback ."
3911,i hope your team does well in the future you guys definitely deserve it . i am also glad bake mayfield did n't pursue his competitive amzing dream . he makes a better footbal players i think .
3912,"yes , we are very excited about baker mayfield at quarterback . the cleveland browns hav been so pitiful for so many years . we have 21 edgar ol kids that do n't even know we ever had a good team ;"
3913,yeah sell hopefully theft will changer ol . sometimes i forget that there are 32 teams in the nfl because we only had abou 'the same teams every year .
3914,"if i have to hear the end england patriots name on more time , i ' j gon na hard ! i hate that they are the one football team that are int he playoffs every and year . uggs !"
3915,i know it is very annoying . i really wish they did n't win the upper bowl again . i would 've really like to see the new orleans saints win this year .
3916,"agreed . and that 's when i did n't wathc it for the first time ever . i was under protest , lo . . . then again , i did bet on the pats to win ,"
3917,well it was a smart be and i hope it paid off for you . it 's kind of interestin tthat the new orleans saints cheerleaders ca n't be at the same restaurant as any nfl player .
3918,probably a good new . . . . lol . . . . . cheerleaders are th east thing a national football league player need stop see when trying to concentrate on football . those gals are too gorgeous !
3919,i com ; lately agree with you . sometimes i would rather watch the in the game . suprisingly thoug 'the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher tha nthe average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player .
3920,"will , i 'm glad they do ! engineers deserve more money tha na sports player in baseball or the national fooball league ."
3921,yeah i agree with you . the football players just get injured too when which is surprising because there 's actually only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game .
3922,"yep ! well , i 'd like to see talking football with ya . but , i 'd better get going . great chatting with you and hold like to . it again . . . . you take care now and have a grea today !"
3923,do you watch football ?
3924,i sure do . snoop dogg once wrote a song for his son 's team
3925,wow cool . u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
3926,i wonde it that is supposed to have some impact on them
3927,i wonder too . bowlers made more than football players in the 60s
3928,do cool . the coaches are the highest paid ever though in the states
3929,i bet . do you know what the highest college football score is ?
3930,"i am not sure , that game was that ?"
3931,"it was georgia tech and cumberland , 2220"
3932,wow what a she . did you know kellan moore one the only left handed qb in the nfl ?
3933,cool . do you like brady ?
3934,"i like him , he is good . do you know brad johnson ?"
3935,i have heard of him . bad was a backup qb in high school
3936,wow a backup ? brad is the only guy to have thrown himslef a touchdown all
3937,wow i did not know that was even possible
3938,me either . only wo africanamerican players case won the superbowl
3939,wow . baker mayfield wanted to be a game player originally
3940,wow . did you know the nfl is using tracking chips now ?
3941,cool what for ? waht are they collecting there ?
3942,htey are collecting velocity and rotation and a bunch of other stuff
3943,"oh i see , can they use that to make the game safer too ?"
3944,do you follow the nfl ? the la chargers lost to the broncos 2022 last week to win the afc conference .
3945,"hello , no i did n't . you keep up with football a lot ?"
3946,not really ? i prefer watching the band ! but some fu facts about fpotyballa re that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are more than th average nfl player and mlb player .
3947,"i read that to crazy ! nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move oh the field . they are also located inside footballs to rack : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
3948,that is why too much form e ! te huddle wash related for american football when a deaf quarterback did n't want to be away hand signals
3949,that 's really considerate !
3950,in the 60s ' top bowlers actually made two times the amount as top football stars
3951,"maybe bowling was much more popular back then . matt patricia is the only rockets scientist coaching in the nfl . before coaching , he was a working aeronautical engineer who graduated from rpi : a school whose fight song includes ' sin ' , ' cosine ' and ' tangent ' , as well as six digits of pi ."
3952,smart guy ! i wonder f he visited hte pink univ of iowa college football locker room
3953,"lol must be some sort of strategy or something ,"
3954,espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games . that is cool !
3955,"yeah ! the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80yard long dirt field inside chicago stadium , then home to the nhl blackhawks ."
3956,theme as a patriot football player named greenellis who never fumbled the football . i guess they should pass to him !
3957,"nice , i wonder why that it is n't that popular r , never heard of him ."
3958,not sure . the highest scoring game racked up 222 point and the other team unfortunately got 0 when georgia tech won over cumberland .
3959,wow ! s snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son 's high school football team .
3960,alex smith took so many ap tests in high school to he went in as a junior to college .
3961,"wow that 's impressive ! those humungous americans lags at football stadiums weigh 1 , 100 pounds and cost 50 , 000 to make"
3962,tat 's huge ! arizona is apparently doing morse i scoring than predicted for football .
3963,that 's unfortunate . 4 of the world 's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college fooball teams .
3964,"i wonder if public o private ? i guess i may be funding them ! better go what home football : ,"
3965,i didnt know there was navy football as well
3966,there seems to be a league before everything
3967,"i agree , i wonder if navy football is any good , seems like its really competitive"
3968,there seems to be an official governing body so it seem suite profesional .
3969,"it does seem taht way , theres different teams like the midshipmen , seems like they have still chance to win the tournament"
3970,i did not en know the quarter back was classes as an offensive player .
3971,it does make sense since they are being the offensive line and only participate in offensive plays
3972,its strange that heereladers are required to leave is a player enters a resturant it seems an outdated concept .
3973,"that is a terrible rule , the saints are a sexist team"
3974,but there are no rules against women playing int he nfl
3975,no rules against that really ?
3976,i wonder how strict the requirements ar end if ana women try .
3977,they must be really strict .
3978,have you ever seen the data from the trackers ?
3979,"no , i havent what about you ? it might be interesting though , all kinds of data"
3980,"i dont follow football , bt its interesting to know n engineer has better earning potential than a football player ."
3981,"well thats because they work for a lot more years than a football players , fooball players usually retire at age 4 nor s"
3982,i bet they engineers body will be in better shape as welp
3983,"yeah and with a better brain function , many pro fooball players end up with terrible injuries or brains damage , in some cases both"
3984,"at is bad , bt i was alot suprised to know that an average live gameplay is only 11 minutes"
3985,"only 121 minutes ! that seems ike a scam ,"
3986,they say it 's time to stop sleeping on the chargers . what do you think ?
3987,"kansas city ? they had a food 121 season , did n't they ?"
3988,"los angeles charger 's had a 3 season . they say they should have a cdefinitive shot at the super bowl his year , what do you think ?"
3989,"theyd id n't make i to the super bowl . do n't know how close they care , do you ?"
3990,out of the thirty two teams they are one that did not . the chargers have made the play offs 6 times .
3991,that 's a solid second . the la rams go 'the spotlight ; guess hte chargers have been overlooked . wo are their star players ?
3992,good question ! you know th iowa university locker room is painted pin for the visitors .
3993,fun college footbal fact ! do you have a fav . college or nfl team ?
3994,well it use to be green bay but i do n't get to watch sports much anymore so i always just hope for a good game when i do .
3995,packers . bret favre . remember those great teams well . used to never miss vikings or green bay makes ! what makes a good game for you ?
3996,"great pals , f air calls and strong defense . how abou thou ? another fun fact top bowlers in the 60 's made more than top nfl players did ."
3997,unheard tthat . fair calls : wel said ! vikings used to pride themselves on defense . great plays makes me think o the qb . was favre your favorite ?
3998,"through the years ut he 's up there with the greats , montana , alway and time of the other 's . how was your favorite ?"
3999,"have to say tom brady , but his jv football coach would not agree . jv team lost every game , an never scored a td . brady as backups b sat sidelines ; coach never put the kid un a game ! has n't brady 's carpet changed since then ? ?"
4000,so very very much . the 's got a bunch of rings and tey just won this years super bowl . plus i heard he wrote a book .
4001,"6 super bowl rings now , all with ne and coach belichik . brady has written a book ; some call it a kind of football ' bible ' . he is very serious , almost religious , a bout commitment to the game . i 'm suspicious of that kind of fervor . . . how about you ?"
4002,well not the fervor rut at i 'm saying about him and this book gives e pause . apparently there is a degrees about bill that states in bill we trust and some call his book a little curtis .
4003,"yes , have read about great . the patriot fans can be pretty ' faithful ' to their team ; . fees ! football is meant to be about passing , kicking balls and scoring td , field goal , etc . it 's a sport , not a religion , do n't you think ?"
4004,i agree 100 percent too much presence is placed on the wrong things . hey did you hear about espn 's emmy award ?
4005,"yes , the one they won years ago for creating that superimposed yellow line on the field at shows viewers how many yards the offensive has to go to get a 1st down ? i used to it now , i ca n't picture watching a game without it ! but somebody created it ."
4006,"yeah it made watching the game taht much less frustrating , lol ! you know that if you are a new orleans cheerleader and you are eating at a restaurant and a player comes int hen you have to leave . i think that 's kind of sexist . well it was nice chatting with you !"
4007,"will leave you w . a thought from my dad , who coached hs footbal for 41 yrs : his fav . think was to watch percent boys run up the field in th wrong direction ; what he ate most was that boy would n't report injuries to hi to they wanted so badly to keep p ; laying . good chat . cheers !"
4008,you too mate !
4009,give her watch high school football ? apparently gonzaga and st john 's are in the top 20 now
4010,does gonzaga play quarterback for st john s ?
4011,"jim think gonzaga is a team , but i 'm not 100 percent sure i do n't follow high school football that much , i only watched a local gem when my nephew is playing lol"
4012,i see . then you probably know i do not watch high school football ! i really do n't even watch the nfl . do you ?
4013,"no i did n't which the nfl either ; i do like tom brady though , that 's the only thing i know is that he 's really good lol"
4014,i hear that guy is a variation of football . it 's even literally called rugby football in place s .
4015,yes i think you 're right . i only like american football though . the also have gaelic football and canadian football
4016,"sorry , meant rugby , not truly ! i hear some of the stadiums have flags that weigh over ha , f a ton . i wonder if thy 've even falsely ?"
4017,yeah i would be so scared if i saw that flag falling on top of me lol . did yo ever hear about the highest scoring football game of all time ?
4018,"i did n't , was it a very high score ? i know it 's a hugh price 5o build a football stadium . i ' v heard just a bit school one can be sixty million !"
4019,wow that 's insane ! you think tha ta high school team does not need a football stadium that complex . did you know that in the 60s top bowlers me more than top football player though ?
4020,"i like bowling more than playing football . one reason is that i liek how you can practice alone because or football it 's always teamwork , but bowling can be done alone ."
4021,yes i agree . it 's also a lot less work to get a team together lol . what do you think about espn winning an emmy for the yellow line on tv ?
4022,"dig best it 's a good idea , but i 'm not sure if it was the bet . i agree that school suspend too much on elaborate stadiums . put of the 25 largest stadiums in the world , 14 are at american colleges . i wonder what their food is like ?"
4023,"yes i 'm curious too . i 'm also curious why the university of iowa painted a locker room pink , i wonder it they thought it would help or hurt team"
4024,"i think that did it for just a joke , or i hope so . i know snoop dogg has a son that plays football ? have you ever seen him play ?"
4025,"no ish hasve n't seen him play . the song ne made is really interesting though , you should look it up on youtube"
4026,"i have n't hear did , i will ! i think quarterbacks tend to be popular players in football , although i 'm not an sure what the do ."
4027,"yes quarterback spare the coens that touch the ball the most and also throw it to other players , baker mayfield is one of the most famous ons"
4028,"ive herd what kellan moore is a famous quarterback in hte nfl known or being left handed . he 's the only one like that , it seems ."
4029,"yes on 're right . he 's very talented too , baker mayfield though played this video game called halo 3 back when he was in college , he was unstoppable at that game e , i was also really good at it too lol"
4030,hello do you like watching football ?
4031,"i love football , the eagles are my team !"
4032,"awesome . they won the 201 super bowl . i do n't really know a lot about football or sports in general , though ."
4033,"they sure did , that was one of the happiest moments of my life !"
4034,is that their first super bowl win ?
4035,"yes , they had never won until that year , tha ties what sad it so special !"
4036,cool who did they play against .
4037,"they played against the new england patriots , the lot to hte giants twice in the 2000s , these re not so great anymore though !"
4038,i guess not ! i found it interesting the learn that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
4039,"that is true , it is very stretched out , bu the eagles won in fantastic style , htey added new player like jabari and derby who helped win"
4040,"it looks like they added quite a few new players , like tourney smith and patrick robinson ."
4041,"yes , and they ars othe gone now , the nfl moves very quickly !"
4042,"they did n't stay long . did they , the to nee teams ? i know they make a lot of money and the nfl ."
4043,"yes , some players use that superbowl as a cancer to improve their value and worth . blunt also left the team . , and he had on the year before that"
4044,are you looking forward to seeing what the team does this year '
4045,"we have a shot at the playoffs , but many players are injured like element , burnett and derby are injured , a nd the makes it tough to win"
4046,"yeah , i bet . injuries probably happen a lot i football ."
4047,"they do k it is partially why the giants collapsed this year , as well as the redskins"
4048,well it was nice talking to you even though i do n't know a lot about football !
4049,"you as well . i did an interestin sport , there is a lot of once to it"

4054,yeah if they meet the requirements they are good to play
4055,yeah . do you know how much gameplay is there in a game ?
4056,yes if is actually only 11 minutes in total
4057,and yet we are glue to the tv for hours to an end
4058,yeah i know . did you hear or the rule for the saints cheerleaders ?
4059,yes they are not allowed to wear tin the same place as the players
4060,yeah and they also have to leave mid meal if they walk in
4061,"so sexist , i really think it needs to go"
4062,i agree di you hear they are using chips on hte players now
4063,yes the are tracking stuff like velocity and rotation and such
4064,i hope they can use that to make the game safer somehow
4065,yeah . do you like brady ?
4066,i do . he was a back up qb in high school
4067,yeah and they did not start hi even when they were not doing well
4068,yeah their loss . do you like alex smith ?
4069,"i do . ge is q good player and a super smart kid , finished college in two year"
4070,yes good lots of ap tests in college and managed to do that
4071,yes good planning . nice chatting with you
4072,"hey there , do yiu watch nfl ?"
4073,"hello there , i do follow the fl , did you watch the superbowl this year ?"
4074,"part of it , how about you ?"
4075,"yeah i kind od fell asleep at the end , but i woke up and saw i had won some money so i was happy . do you have a favorite nfl team ?"
4076,i do not have a favorite one . how about you ? i liek that they have no rule against women who can also play in the nfl ; ?
4077,"yeah i think that is super cool , i really want a female player to make a team and play and there well soon . i think it would be so great for all the young girls into sports . and i follow the packers ."
4078,"yeah , i mean even the locker room for university of iowa players was pin ."
4079,yeah is n't that hilarious . i wonder how they got the ok for that to get painted in the first place .
4080,yeah i wonder too . in the sixties top bowlers made twice as much as football players ?
4081,"that is so funny , oh if i could have a choice to do it again , i would be a top bowler in the 60 's . i woul dave the life then ."
4082,yes so true . did you know that espn once won an emmy ?
4083,yeah i heard they won it years back when they came out with the yellow line show for the first down line .
4084,that is so interesting . the highest score in football was scored when geogia defeated cumberland .
4085,was n't it a crazy score of over 2000 ? i think i read about that one time .
4086,yeah that is truly crazy . a former patriots rb never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
4087,"i heard that . what was his name , i don ' remember got know he played for the patriots ."
4088,his name was benjarvus greenellis . pretty intereting .
4089,yeah that is amazing . do you know hen the first nfl playoff game was held ?
4090,no i do not know that . do you ?
4091,"it was way back in 1932 ! in china stadium , and the field was basically dirt and only 8 yards long . it was the same place the blackhawks played !"
4092,oh wow i as been around for so long . it wa nice chatting with you .
4093,are you watching the superbowl this year ? wouldnt it be interesting o see a woman ploy for either team .
4094,"i 'll probably watch it . are you ? you know , teh nfl does n't have any rules against a woman laying ."
4095,"yeah i just found about that tough i dont we will ever see one at a pro level , i also didnt know he average gmail play is 11 minutes"
4096,"id id n't know that either . next game i 'm going to watch to see it hat is true . i do know , though , that there is only 16 regular season games ."
4097,"realy only 16 thought here were more games , so anyway whats your favorite football position ?"
4098,"well , there is if you count playoffs nad preseason . oh , and each time ahs a bye week . my favorite position is either quarterback or wide receiver . you ?"
4099,"mine is runnjngback , its been my favorite since i saw benjarvus greenellis play , so much talent ."
4100,"i 've never heard of him . i 'm old school and have to admit taht my favorite running abc was tony dorsett back in the day . but now , as far as talent goes , there 's some good players out there . baker mayfield for example . he 's so talented at stuff he could even do professional video game playing !"
4101,"yeah i know who mayfield is , he is talented i heard he was pretty good at halo back in college ."
4102,yep . i like multifaceted players . alex smith for example is reported duo be very smart . he was working on a master 's degree before being drafted ? .
4103,"wow , i guess he is one of the few football players with a masters degree , that is admirable ."
4104,"i thing so too . football can be inspiring like that . i mean , tom brady was a second string quarterback in high school and now look !"
4105,"i bet his coach didnt think he would get so far , his been ina almost every superbowl since 2002"
4106,i agree . i wonder hat will happen with the patriots when he retires . the quarterback is th leader of the team and they do n't seem to have a good replacement in place .
4107,"i know , the qb is so influential hat he touches the ball in every play , they are going to have a hard time finding a good replacement , not sure how the second string qb i right now ."
4108,"knowing that , teams need really good quarterback . did you know taht kellan moore is the only left handed one ?"
4109,"i didnt know that , football sure is a nice sport , there are many crass stat side the one in which georgia tech defeated another team by 222 points"
4110,that is crazy ! i would ave loved to see that game ! i bet neither team had any ddfesne at fall !
4111,"yeah , or the other team was probably full with blind peoples ."
4112,maybe the home team should have tried o psych their opponent out liken he university of iowa does . they have the visitors locker room painted pink .
4113,yeah that can certainly demoralize a team .
4114,do you know who baker mayfield ; is ?
4115,i 'm not sure if i do .
4116,"he is a quarterback , he used to play for the redskins and now is preparing for the senior bowl"
4117,"oh , okay . i love teh game off football , although i find it good that the nfl has no written rule against female players ."
4118,theres no written rule really ? i wonder if well ever see a female player then
4119,"well , we might . as long as a female can meet league eligibility requirements , she is free to play ."
4120,"great maybe some day , did you hear about those tracking chips the nfl use ? amazing how much the game ha grown over hte years"
4121,"yes , o 've heard the nfl uses the chips in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field ."
4122,"i think thats intersting , very use it to track their position and then they also place the chips on the footballs and all kids of interestin stats are pulls from them"
4123,well then i guess they can really hold the players accountable for how they are playing and also make some really good plans too .
4124,i agree so did you hear about the rule the againts have against cheerleaders in their team ?
4125,"yes ! it sounds completely sexist to me . i can not imagine being at a place eating as a cheerleader , having a player walk 1bn , ad having to get up and leave without finishing my meal !"
4126,"i how right , having to walk away would be humiliating specially if you are with friends and family , humiliating ah totally unfair"
4127,i agree . seems dated . can you believe the the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of an nfl player ?
4128,"that actually make sense , most players have a carreer o 820 years add then engineers work for 40 years or even score"
4129,"well , yes . i 'm not sure which career ri 'd like better . it would be nice to have the nfl perks , that 's for sure ."
4130,yeah but the others are all the injuries associated with the game and the brain damage
4131,"well , yeah , that is ad drawback . even top bowlers in the 1960 's made twice as much as top footbal stars . i think id father bowl !"
4132,"i like bowling , it seems like a safe game not a lot of room for injuries , well bowlers make a lot less now"
4133,yes . i 'm sure they still make better money than a 95 though . they hav veto eb talented thouhg . like former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the fb in his nfl career !
4134,"i have to google that like right now , h e never fumbled the ball ? wow , anyways its been great chatting with you i feel lot smarter now"
4135,"no , never in his career ! naive chatting with you a sell ."
4136,"im googling that for sure seems unreal , thanks or all bye ."
4137,hey how ar you ? you watch the nfl at all ?
4138,"yes i am a real nfl fan , i try to watch most games ."
4139,"right on , you a ravens fan by chance ? or you like another team ?"
4140,"teh ravens is pretty goo d , but i like the pittsburgh steelers , even though they are n't a come from behind team ."
4141,"oh man , i 'm sorry you 're a steelers fan lol . antonio brown and le ; veto bell gone in a year ?"
4142,"that 's what i am thinking about , but that always been my team , they do need better players , they seem to fall everytime against a good team like new england ."
4143,"true , just smithschuster and jams connery safe both special players too , e are if they only play for 11 minutes thr5ouhgout the game ."
4144,do you actually believe that a our quarter game only 11 minutes of live plays ?
4145,"i could maybe see that , i thought it 'd be a lot like to be honest . if we 're just talking about from snap to whistle . what do you think ?"
4146,"i would say no way , including quarterback time , run time , field goal time , it almost takes the average person 11 minutes to enjoy a nice inner ' just my opinion ."
4147,"haha for sure , i think it 's just between the whistles though right . like a fg would start when the ball is snapped and sun when the white is blown , so like 5 seconds ? it 'd be interesting to see the way they can up witht hat stat ."
4148,"i woul degree with that , what do you think about omen in th nfl , do you thnk th ratings will drop to a low ?"
4149,"not sure , if they can keep up that would be cool to see , i just do n't see it happening anytime soon , what do you think ?"
4150,"i am not trying to be negative , but i don ' thee it either , cause it would be hard to find a 250 to 300lbs player hitting a woman head on , i ca n't see that happening ."
4151,"true , maybe as a kicker or punter sometime ? i do n't know who would really want to p ; ay in the nfl anyways . alex smith is pretty smart too , took a lot of ap tests in high school"
4152,"that 's true , i would be upset if i play the f pool and a player let another player run by and make a touch down just because she 's a woman ."
4153,"true , i could see that . how much did junipero serial hs regret not playing tom brady ?"
4154,"wow , i bet he still regret it , it you know in 1960 georgia tech defeated cumberland 220 ? i never heard of cumberland , have you ?"
4155,"i have not , they 're in georgia though i 'd assume right ? they probably shut down the school after hat game haha ."
4156,"hahaha , they probably did , because i pretty sure they most haven fired the coach . i did n't know , elon most is the only , it hand in then fl ."
4157,"for sure , i wonder when he was hte only one . irma doing to trek off though , take care and great chat !"
4158,hi ! do you like football ?
4159,hi . yes i do . i especially like american football . do you ?
4160,i 'm not that big of a fan . i did fin it intresting that here is one one left handed qb in the nfl
4161,that is interesting . another interesting fact is that the huddle was started because of a deaf quarterback .
4162,that 's very interesting ! the junipero serra high scool had such a bad year they failed to even score . touchdown .
4163,i honk i 've heard of them before . during that year was n't their starting usarterbzck tom brady ?
4164,"actually , he was this backup . they never played him !"
4165,that 's right ! he was the backup . he 's been a starter for so long now 9 just automatically said it ll ! have you heard of baker mayfield before ?
4166,"yeah , i have heard the name but i do n't know much about him ."
4167,he was the starting quarterback for the university of oklahoma . word is he 's not only great at football but asl at video makes . he 's so good they considered becoming a professional gamer .
4168,that 's cool . do you know who alex smith s ?
4169,his name sounds familiar . is n't he a professional quarterback too ?
4170,"yes , and he 's smart . he earned his bachelors degree in 2 years of got his masters before becoming the first pick in 2005 draft"
4171,"show ! that is impressive ! good for him ! he must have worked very hard in school . i mean , quarterbacks touch the ball for practically every offensive play so you know he was busy with footballs nd to stills o so great academically is fantastic ."
4172,no doubt ! i wonder if hr every played iowa in college . their visitor 's locker room is pink !
4173,"that 's funny . i guess that school has a good sense of humor . speaking of schools , have you heard of georgia tech ?"
4174,i have heard of them . in guessing they have a good team ?
4175,"not sure if hey do now , but back in 1916 the did . they scored the most points ever in a game . they get cumberland 2220 ."
4176,"wow , that 's quite a pumping ! could you imagine being on the losing side for that game ?"
4177,i would feel awful . that bad of a beating would probaby make ms highly consider quitting playing . i ca n't help but wonder though why they just didn ? tall the gum . some point .
4178,i totally agree . great chat ! have a good one !
4179,"hi there ! looking forward to chat with you ! ; k ,"
4180,"you too both . do you watch football ? the nfl has 3 teams , the ny giants are my favorite team"
4181,"i don ' 5 really watch . . . i 'm from europe we watch football , soccer , ; , giants huh ? where you 're from ? all my neighbors are cheering for giants ; ,"
4182,"i 'm from connecticut , right next to ny . we do n't have any of the 16 teams frost he nfc or afc in my state unfortunately"
4183,"ahh , i 'm from pong island ny , so i guess were neighbors ; ,"
4184,i wonde rift european football uses tracking chips in who the nfl embed the into shoulder pads
4185,"yeah i do n't think so ; , i mean , i 've never heard about that . i wonder what 's the point . . ."
4186,"i guess the nfl uses them o track the players movement and they also have them in the ball to track velocity , rotation , speed , and location"
4187,"holy crap , so much data for running with then all and passing it from time to time . . . : , hey i heard that the biggest score in football was 2220 ? i stat really high ?"
4188,usually in the pros once you break into the 40s its consider really high . in college where ill be a game once in a while that breaks into the 60 's or 70s
4189,what . . . so how the hell did they do hat ? 222 ? t hat 's like 4 times bigger score than that . . .
4190,"yea , it must of been the best team in college football at the time facing another college that 's team had the skill equivalent of a high school team"
4191,are matches like that entertaining tow hatch ? soccer matches are really exciting even birth score 00
4192,"if the game ar melrose ins core they tend to fun to watch , if it 's onesided and pu 're not a fan of the high scoring team then no , that 's why i do n't really like college football 90 percent of the games are n't competitive"
4193,"i he , . . . int he 1960 's top bowlers made twice a such as top football stars was bowling that popular in usa ?"
4194,"not really , back in the 60s football wasnt ' as popular and there was no unions , players during he offseason worked regular job"
4195,"ahh , ok . . . hey what 's up with those pink locker rooms in university of iowa 's ? did you ear about that ?"
4196,head times i guess . did you know 14 of the world 's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college footbal teams ?
4197,probably huge budget stand behind it . . . that 's why it 's also so popular . . .
4198,"yea , kinda a shame sports are more important tha academics , the highest paid across all u . s . department of defense employees are three football coaches of the service branch teams ."
4199,"i agree , bu tit was always like that . . . entertainment above all whatever brings more profit . . . hey , it was really nice chattin with you !"
4200,you too k place a good one
4201,are you familiar with college footballs ?
4202,"halo , actually more familiar with the fl"
4203,"me too . so , why are quarterbacks so important ?"
4204,the are very very important because thye re teh leaders of the offensive team
4205,do they really make calls during huddle ? i thought coaches do those .
4206,"it looks like that is the way ! well and we are getting close to the superbowl , how you like that ?"
4207,"i a , m goin goto watch superbowl on tv ."
4208,me too ! did you know there is aw crazy rules for the new orleans saints heereladers ?
4209,no id o n't . please tell me about it .
4210,the ca n't eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player !
4211,"i just read about , after you mentioned it , . what is hte reason for that ?"
4212,"i thinkk hat makes no sense , i the cheerleader is already eating there , an a player comes in , they have to leave . i do not think there is a valid reason ."
4213,is it legal ? it is discrimination . i think the cheerleaders shoudl stay if they are there before players .
4214,i totals agree with you . and at least the nfl has no rule against female players .
4215,i heard about that . no female player has even interested in lining the nfl so far .
4216,if a woman wanted and met the requirements she could get in but i dont it woudl happen anytime soon .
4217,i agree with you . do you know tha nfl places chips in players shoulder pads ?
4218,"yes , i heard something about it ! tell me more"
4219,the league wants to know the players ' each move to the field .
4220,"we enjoy the game so much , but did you know how much is actually actual play time ?"
4221,"no . please tell me abou tit . also , who do you think will win the superbowl ?"
4222,"just 11 minutes , we will just wait and see . it was a pleasure talking to you !"
4223,hey ! how 's i going ? do you like football ?
4224,yes j do . . . very much ! do you ?
4225,"i do , what the you think about baker mayfield ?"
4226,he seems pretty good so far ! wo 's you 're favorite team out th 132 teams in the nfl ?
4227,"i 'm a new orleans saints on myself , h ? about you ?"
4228,that 's cool . . . i like them . . . although payton 's faces are pretty funny ! i am an eagles fan .
4229,"yeah they are . i like the eagles too , there 's been a lot of good players come through there ."
4230,yeah . . . be nice to have a consistent quarterback ! i cant ' believe kellen moore is he only left handed b !
4231,i ca n't either . i find that odd . i guess the last quarterback i knew of in the league was tim tebow .
4232,so i wonder when we will see a female player in the nfl ?
4233,"i 'm not sure , i ' surprised there has n't been one since there 's no rule against it ."
4234,so true ! what position you think she will play ?
4235,i 'm not sure . i could see q defensive back or something .
4236,i was thinking ore like a kicker .
4237,that would work too . i would just hope they would get treated better than the cheerleaders . the saints 's cheerleaders are forbidden from eating at the same restaurant as any nfl player .
4238,crazy isn ; t it ? you ever heard of that before being a saints fan ?
4239,"i had not , it 's pretty horrible . even if there are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , they have to leave . that is crazy to me !"
4240,extremely unfair . . . they need to hang that rule . . . i'ts very rude !
4241,i agree they top . the game has changed so much in the nfl . in the 60 's top bowlers made twice as much as top nfl stars . now i 'm sure that 's reversed unfold .
4242,oh yea . . . for sure ! how about we sit around for 3 hours watching a game for only 11 total minutes of live gameplay . . . we must be crazy !
4243,"i know right ! i a n't believe it ! well i have to run , it was nice chatting with you . i hope you have a good night !"
4244,hi ! are you a football fan ?
4245,yeah i do football how about ou .
4246,"i watch more college than the nfl , buy yes i am ."
4247,i dont watch much college other than the mountaineers every now and then . im a big steelers fan o i watch them every week .
4248,"i watch fsu and sadly i grew up a dolphins fan , so there is no hope there . lol"
4249,lol da s lean as you pick a team and brick with them . i hate it when somebody just goes with a team just cause they are in well .
4250,"yeah , not a fair weather fan . i would stick by my team even if they er losing by 222 . like the highest scoring game ever ."
4251,"that would be embarrassing to lose by that much , but i would still stick with them as well ."
4252,it is more embarrassing on howto hes saints treat heir cheerleaders in my opinion .
4253,yeah i read that to . that is rediculous .
4254,in the 60 's nfl stars werent making as much so that egos probably werent as big .
4255,"i know right . if bowlers are makings more than you are , i dont think you can get to big of a head on your shoulders . lol ."
4256,"i cant even name 1 professional bowler , ever ."
4257,me either . i just think o that movie with woody harrison . i think it cup or somethings like that . it also as tin
4258,kingpin ? that is the one i think of .
4259,yeah that might be it . lol . brings back memories .
4260,"guy . a time before that yellow line , that espn won the emmy for . lol"
4261,well that yellow line is prettyawesome if you ask me .
4262,"i totally agree , i dont know how to watch without it . its just not the same ."
4263,nope . it really give you a new perspective . you can physically see where we need to get to . when a guy stretches out you get to make a judgement on th spot whether he got it or not . love it .
4264,did you know there is only 1 left handed qb int he nfl ?
4265,i didnt know that actually . i figured there woudl be a least a for . good chat though ttyl .
4266,"how 's it going , are you a football fan ? it 's amazing benjarvus greenellis never fumbled in his career"
4267,he was a graet player he used to play for the patriots right ?
4268,yea and i believe he may of played for only of the other 32 teams in the nfl
4269,"i wonder if he ever won a superbowl with the team , i guess he played i brady ,"
4270,i think he did . it 's crazy that brady never started for his jv team despite them never winning a game
4271,"so much talent wasted , the coach made a terrible decision ! i bet he was teased for that years later"
4272,"hopefully he no coaches at junipero serra high school l , not only did htey not win a game they did n't evens core a touchdown"
4273,"wow his high school coach must be like the worse czech in the history of the game lol , h e hid a legend on the bench , ge is a 4 . 5 time super bowl winner i bet he could handle a high school game"
4274,"alex smith also went to high school in ca , not only was he a good qb he has a samba student who passed a bunch of ap tests"
4275,"yeah i hear he got his ba in just wo years and then reagan on his masters degree , i wonder if theres a phd was well"
4276,welp alex smith did begin working on his master 's degree before he was drafted into the nfl
4277,i think thats great many players wont study and then they will end with deep financial problems after their carreers are over
4278,"i do n't think baker mayfield di doo much studying , he plays a lot of video games when he 's not playing football"
4279,he considered becoming a pro video game player once right ?
4280,"amyfiled did , he claims he can beat anyone at halo"
4281,"he and i must have wa halo contest then , i am a great halo player one of the best"
4282,i wonder if th nfl would use tracking chips to record mayfield and you playing halo
4283,"i would have no problem with that as love as i et a shot to defeat mayfield , he wong see me coming"
4284,"good luck which that , i hope the match woulda e longer khan the 11 minutes of live gameplay a nfl game averages"
4285,"12 minutes doesnt seem like a lot , specially when each quarter is 15 min long"
4286,"well i have to go , nic chatting with you"
4287,hello ! how are you today ?
4288,doing well thanks . how about you ?
4289,i 'm going great as well ! do you like football ?
4290,i follow it some . do you think there will ever be a women playing in th nfl ?
4291,maybe as a kicker to start with ! more and more girls are getting into it with is awesome ! what do you think ?
4292,"i think there will be , 'm all for it if they can do it . did you know the average nfl game only has 11 minute of live action ?"
4293,"that 's great ! id id n't know that , its too funny thouhg because we waste 3 hours watching with aha ."
4294,"yeah , a also think abou how manly hours of practice they go through for just 11 minutes ."
4295,i agree ! i bet the 1916 game that was 2220 took more than 11 minutes of gameplay lol .
4296,i 'm sur ep i ca n't believe they did n't stop that game .
4297,i would have just walked off the field lol . i wonder if they were in a race because of a pink locker room like the iowa hawkeyes do ?
4298,maybe . i fi was on the a that had their locker room painted i would retaliated by shutting off the hawkeyes hot water .
4299,haha that would be a nice revenge measure ! would you rather have been a bowler or a football player in the 1960s ?
4300,in the 60 's i would have rather been a football player . today i have more sense . how about you ?
4301,i would have been a bowler because they were paid much more than footbal players !
4302,it can see your point . what do you think about the tracking chips then fl uses ?
4303,i think it is great because it record a players every move o the field . i wonder what the do with teh footballs !
4304,"well , good brady could how many times the football rotated and then let some air out ."
4305,"haha i 'm sure he somehow ' lost ' the hips on that footbal haha . k see hid jv high school football team was terrible , but they never put him in !"
4306,"ha , right tc i hav to give brady credit , no matter what else he has had quite a career ."
4307,"he reall did . it was nice chatting , have a great day !"
4308,"i do n't keep up with individual players much , but the nfl gains a lot of attention wen t 's not in the 17 weeks of the regular season"
4309,"yeah it does , i know it still has the highest tv ratings of last of our major sports ."
4310,i wonder how much more popular it would be a these were a female player . there 's technically no rule against that happening
4311,i think that would be so cool if a female player did and a pro team . to young gurls into sports it would be huge as well .
4312,can you believe each game i soley really eleven minute of live gameplay
4313,"is n't that pretty crazy , does n't seem like anything , but there are tons of stops in teh game ."
4314,"still , that seem so short . i wonder how they used to keep track of all the stats before they had chips embedded in the footballs and shoulder pads . then again , people were n't as obsessed with fantasy footbal , l before all the technology"
4315,that is true an there waist nearly the amount of focus and attention to injuries as there ar now . especially all of the stuff on concussions .
4316,also true . it can be risky even now . i 'm not sure f all the money is worth it if engineers can make more money over a lifetime
4317,"yeah i think whe 'you add it up those engineers make more because they work for a much longer time , but i would be wrong ."
4318,that 's probably also us . the work if likely more steady and requires less moving useless you 're as good az tom brady and can stay with the same team over a long period of time
4319,i wonder how many year strom has left in him . i would say he has won enough .
4320,who knows ? maybe he likes being the leader of the offensive team
4321,"speaking of football , do you know what the highest scoring game ever was ?"
4322,was n't it when georgia tech played against cumberland ?
4323,"good call ! yeah its ones like the defense did n't show up that at all , or the offend i guess ."
4324,maybe georgia tech had a good rb . greenellis nerve fumbled the ball during his nfl career
4325,"tthat is some stat , to be a pro running back and never had a fumble , that is impressive ."
4326,very true . the visitor 's lockers at the university of iowa are painted pink . i wonder who idea that was
4327,that is pretty funny that whoever is in charge at that school gave the ok for them to paint it that way .
4328,true ! i wonder if the other variations o ffoobtalk have funny traditions like american football does . i 'm sure rugby players have similar stories
4329,"hey , how 's it going ? are you a big football fan ? i 'm not the biggest fan , tbh but i find a lot little as about it fascinating . ."
4330,"i love watching football , my favorite teams are the iowa hawkeyes and minnesota vikings ! do you have a favorite team of the 32 nfl teams ?"
4331,"i would n't say i ahve a favorite , per se , but i like some of the quirks of certain teams . for instance , do you know univerity of iowa 's visitor 's locker room is painted pink ? ha , i find tha funny !"
4332,"of course i do , htey do it for psychology purposes , it turns to be a calming color"
4333,yeah colors have different effects on people . i remember in high school reading about an experiments where they painter da weight lifting room pink and they found the people in there could n't lift as much weight !
4334,"wow i need to read up on that , that i amazing what a color can do lol . have you heard of alex smith ?"
4335,name sounds familiar but i do n't recognize it offhand . . .
4336,he was the 1 pick in 2005 as a quarterback . he got his college degree his sophomore year of college because he wass o smart
4337,"wow , that 's amazing ! really helps break the stereotype of locks not being that bright . speaking of quarterbacks , this one fellow baker mayfield considered quitting football to pursue competitive video gaming ."
4338,"ish and that too , i think halo 3 was his game . i would beat him one oh one !"
4339,"dunno . . . i think i 'd stick wish football term use the video games as a backup . then again , you 're less likely to be injured playing video games , so i funny . . . ."
4340,"forms one , no one plays halo 3 much more , the game is like 15 years old already ha"
4341,did you know the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback ?
4342,"i think i knew that back in the day , paul hubbard i thinkk as the quarterback . look what he started , i wonder why they huddle"
4343,"yeah , he did n't want to risk malone reading his hand signals and knowing what they were up to ."
4344,"that is smart . do you know any lefty quarterback in the nfl , apparently kellen moore is the only one right now ."
4345,"i have n't heard of any to honest . speaking of which , do you think a woman could play football ? there 's technically no rules in the nfl against it , so long as they meet the eligibility requirements ."
4346,"that would be interesting to see . i would watch that if it happened , it would be legendary"
4347,"speaking of legendary the biggest score ever in a football came was 1916 . georgia tech defeated cumberland with a whooping 2220 . wow , get the feeling somebody was n't even trying that right . . ."
4348,"that would have been so crazy to watch , i would have quit after the score got to 1000 . there should have bee na mercy rule"
4349,"well , listen , it 's been awesome talking o you ! you have a terrific day !"
4350,"you too , have a great day !"
4351,hey are you an nfl an ? i am and i like to speculate about next reason . one hot topic is whether dem bryant is still elite . wear do you think ?
4352,i 'm not a big fan do n't know a lot about football . i know he is a player for th cowboys .
4353,oh thats too bad . yeah football can be a tough game . an nfl game only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay is n't that odd ?
4354,yeah that is odd . also odd that new orleans saints cheerleaders ca n't see tin the same restaurant as an nfl player . very strange .
4355,yeah i have heard that ; i don ; t like ethan ruleapparently they are world about the cheerleaders distracting the player . footbal easy n't always popular thoygh8n the 1960 's pro bowlers made more money than football players !
4356,wow that 's really surprising . i know they bring in the money now . even though an engineer still earns more in a lifetime than a nfl or mlb player on average .
4357,"yeah thats a great pointbecause the only career is so shottoo many injuries , no longevity . did you know the nfl uses chips i nthe players shoulder pads to track their movements on the fieldprobably to make sure they do n't knee lol ."
4358,haha yeah and they track the football itself too !
4359,oh interesting l no wonder they have so many interesting statistics ! do you think there will ever be a woman nfl player ? they are allowed to play you know .
4360,yeah i was kind of surprised to learn that . i 'm sure it wil ; l come up at some point . i wonder if it has n't happened yet because women are n't aware of this or because they fail to meet league eligibility requirements .
4361,probably because they ar smart and do n't want to crash their brain and body lol . but u think there is a woman player who is becoming very closes is one of the best players in recent years i saw on espn . i do n't remember what position though .
4362,yeah it cam definitely do some damage playing football .
4363,definitely . but football players definitely know how to live like andc have fun . the university of iowas locker room painted their visiting team locker room pink .
4364,that 's something i would like t see . i guess that 's supposed to mass with the opposing team before the game haha
4365,"yeah i et it works ! one exciting things to watch during an nfl , gamer is when a player fumbles , beef former patriots running back greenellis never fumbled in his life ! crazy ."
4366,that 's pretty impressive . also interesting that kellan moore is the one left handed quarterback in the nfl .
4367,"yeah totally agree . interesting because in some sports like tennis it can be an advantage , but apparently not in the nfl ."
4368,"also pretty interesting that the circular huddle was created by hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could't read in hand signals . pretty smart and the huddle has stuck with the sport ."
4369,tha ties very interesing . i always wondered about that . it is funny how certain behaviors and acts use stick over time and no one questions where they originated .
4370,yes that is very true . well it has been nice talking to you .
4371,you too . have a great day !
4372,goodbye .
4373,hello do you like football ?
4374,"id o , what about you ? i ' m huge redskins fan , ."
4375,"i dot follow it much , i i do watch it , its only cuz the 49ers are playing lol i like the niners , buy they havent been doing well in awhile lol"
4376,"nice , did you know the nfl uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads to record their move on the field ?"
4377,"yeah thats pretty interesting , i believe they put it in the football as well ."
4378,really ? what do they do with the data ?
4379,"probably us it for stats , not sure exactly or"
4380,"interesting . well apparently matt patricia is a rocket scientist , so maybe he knows !"
4381,"yes , maybe they use it for rockets ! ! lol did you kow there is no written rule about females playing goin then fl , like technically women can play !"
4382,"yeah , i 'm not sure that people would want to see them get injured on tv though ."
4383,"i dont wan otto see anyone get injured on tv , but they still do it lol"
4384,"yea h , this is true . did you know there i only 1 left handed qb in th end l ?"
4385,yeah thats a interesting fact .
4386,"yeah , it is . apparently it is kellan moore , he is pretty good , right or"
4387,"i have no clue , i never heard of him . do you kno wthe patriots ? they used o have a player that never fumbled the ball in his career ."
4388,"had , they just won the super bowl , did you watch it ?"
4389,"no , i didnt watch it , i went snowboarding instead lol"
4390,hilarious . did you know snoop dog wrote a fight song for his son 's high scool team ?
4391,tht sounds pretty cool . i wonder if it was any good lol
4392,i net it 's a different sound than his current music ! are you a fan or snoop dog ?
4393,yeah i know a lot of his songs .
4394,"nice , i have n't heard any of his ne stuff , but hopefully he is still good . anyways , mice chanting with you ."
4395,do you like football ?
4396,"i kind of hate it , bu tit seems like i 'm a minority in that respect amongst americans . i think i like rugby better haha ."
4397,"i dont follow rugby taht much but it seems like a great sport , gaelic football is new to me , first time hearing about that variation of the sport"
4398,i think any variation i more efficient than american football . did you kno that there 's only 11 minutes of live gameplay in the course of an average nfl lame ?
4399,"only 11 minutes ? wow , that seems unfair to fans and to newer of the game ,"
4400,"well , there are 17 weeks of game regular season , plus the playoffs , so i guess it adds do ! people just watch the super bowl for the commercials anyway ."
4401,"yeah , i gues commercials are pretty goo ? did you watch this years super bowl ?"
4402,i did not . maybe i 'd watch if women plwayedhere 's actually no official rule against it !
4403,"neat would be interesting , you now top bowlers made more money than football players back in the 60s"
4404,"i wonder if that applied to female bowlers , too . did you know that an engineer actually has a higher average lifetime earnings than a typical nfl player ?"
4405,"i didnt know that no , that seems a bit unreal considering ho much pro football players make"
4406,"well , their careers are pretty brief , although some players like tom brady last a pretyy longs i , and he was backup qb of his high school jv team m ."
4407,"he is 40 years old and still the icon of heist yeah , and really he was ? wow ? so much talent wasted on th bench"
4408,"will , some qbs have other interests , too , like schooler exam ; le , alex smith entered college as a junior because he had so much credit from all the ap courses he took in high school ."
4409,"sounds liek he is a really smart qb , not only a great player but smart guy"
4410,"yes . another qb who was good a mother stuff is oklahoma 's baker mayfield , who considered quitting football and becoming a fulltime competitive video game player ."
4411,"i think he made he right all there , footbal players make tons of money"
4412,there 's a lot of money to be made from all of the tv righysespn even won an emmy fo creating the superimposed firs down line .
4413,"they did . ? i guess spun changed the game with teh creation of the yellow first down line e , its on every game"
4414,"i wonder if canadians get the same the , or no one cares enough to otehr there saga ."
4415,"i guess no one bothers lol , even deserved the emmy , the first down line will continue to be part f the game for years to come ."
4416,hi . did you know espn won an emmy for tha superimposed yellow line of theirs ?
4417,i did not know that ! i guess espn discovered something that people needed all along .
4418,"i o n't see how it 's needed , but i 'm not a fo9tabll fan . maye they should ahve used it in that game on georgia tech , where they defeated heir opponent 2220 ."
4419,it help understand bust how closet eh team is to a first down . sometimes its not clear . i figure that gt did nit need todo 9 that to poor cumberland .
4420,"ah . okay . thanks for explaining it . i thought it may have been something to do with being owned by disney , and their imagineers were bored , lol . i would love to see the u of ia 's pink , visitor 's lockerroom ."
4421,i would love to see it too . and talk to the person that decided to do that . does it have navy effect t ? i wonder
4422,"i would think they would enjoy the ambiance , lol . its ' weird that there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
4423,i guess there is a lot of standing nad waiting and the officials converting and stuff . great pay for all that waiting lol
4424,they sure do . what do you think of the use of tracking chips in the balls ?
4425,i think it is good to understand how the game work . i would like to improve player safety . i think the chips might helo there .
4426,sia with the ones in the shoulder pads ?
4427,"yes , they could help understand situations when players get hurt . maybe understand iowa to minimize risk of injury ."
4428,"i 'm shocked a woman has n't been on a team yet , the nfl does n't have any rules prohibiting it ."
4429,"i would expect that some positions could eb open to women , like kicker or punter . but the is pipeline of male talent ."
4430,"sounds kind of seems t , same with the saint 's archaic rule against cheerleaders eating in the sam restaurant as the players ."
4431,"yes , it is sexist and misogynistic . tha cheerleaders are adults . very can be with the players in a public space ."
4432,"it 's disgusting to think that is hey are in the middle of their meal , they must leave when one comes in . it ' ; s for that reason alone , i do n't buy any saints merch when i am in nola ."
4433,i doom know why that rule was started . there must have been a problem like romantic relationships or something .
4434,"they would think there would be more teams stat hae that . clint from cleveland , i 'm grateful thet baker mayfield did n't decide o become a pro gamer , fo 'the tweets by the end alone ."
4435,i guess some people should become gamers because they lost have other sports to play . but he had a choice . that is an easy one to make in my mind .
4436,"supposedly , hes ' pretty goof at halo 3 . that 's a tough game , and pro gamers can rake in big bucks at tournaments ."
4437,"i guess they can , but how long is the career ? football can lead to many things . anway , great chat !"
4438,"thanks , have a nice day ."
4439,quarterbacks are always the most known position of any football team in america . i guess that 's because they have the ball on almost every play .
4440,whats your favorite football teams ?
4441,my favorites are the dallas cowboys and teh kansas city chiefs . what are yours ?
4442,the dolphins and thee angles . who is your favorite quarterback of all time ?
4443,"that 's a hard one . i like roger staunch , troy aikman , john wat , and currently patrick mahomes and baker mayfield . you ?"
4444,dan marino and calm newton . do you know two the only left handed quarterback currently is ?
4445,i think it is kellan moore . did you know that baker mayfield considered going into professional gaming ? he says he can beat anyone at halo 3 .
4446,is if he ca neat anyone cause my roommate is pretty good lol . do you know how many teams are currently in the whole league ?
4447,i am thinking 32 but i think they should add more and nike the soon longer . which conference to you like the best ?
4448,i like the nfc what about you ?
4449,i liar the nfc too . will you be watching th super bowl ?
4450,definitely i 'm going to beg grilling some steaks and ribs a nice bbq to sit down and watch the game . who do you think will win this year ?
4451,"if dallas goes , hen dallas . but if they don ' , then kansas city ? who do you think will win ?"
4452,i hope dallas wins it will be great for all the old school cowboys fans in see their team holding that trophy gain . the chiefs have a good chance but i 'm going ifr dallas ;
4453,an eagles fan going for dallas ? that 's a surprise !
4454,pol well i 'm also a dolphins fans so you have to know i have family down south so i can definitely appreciate teh team . do you know what teh highest score in a game ever was ?
4455,makes sense . waht was it ?
4456,says it was back in 1916 georgia tech blew out cumberland 222 to zero
4457,definitely no defense from cumberland ! i like that the university of iowa paints the visiting team 's locker room pink !
4458,"lol its classic mental tactics to get into their heads . iowa 's coach is a genius ,"
4459,true !
4460,"hi , how are you ?"
4461,"hey there , pretty well , he are you ?"
4462,"i am well , thanks . do you like football ?"
4463,i do how about you ?
4464,i do like it . my favorite team is the bears . how about you ?
4465,"did you know women an play in nfl as well , if they qualify ?"
4466,i did not . wo a there 's only 11 minutes of play in an nfl game .
4467,i know yet we are glued tot eh tv for hours to an end
4468,do you watch a lot of tv ? i wish i watched less .
4469,i do because i like to watch sports games a lot
4470,me too . that 's what i watch a the time . do you know who tom brady is ?
4471,yes a very very famous quarterback that plays for the patriots
4472,in high school team was terrible and eh still couldnt ged into hte gem . seems like a giant missteps now .
4473,yeah go figure life sometimes . do you know alex smith ?
4474,"i do . he is a qb , right ?"
4475,yes . he was so good in school that when he entered university he was bumped to junior .
4476,"wow , i was so bad , they tried to keep me back a year . turns out i was just learning disabled ."
4477,yeah at least nowadays there are better way to figure those out . did you hear about the new orleans cheerleaders real ?
4478,"no , what is it ?"
4479,they cant eat in the sam restaurant s the players
4480,that 's sexist . nic chatting with you !
4481,"hi , how are you ?"
4482,"hello , im great , so do you follow the nfl or college football ?"
4483,i follow both . do you follow either or both ?
4484,"i fellow both , have you seen virginia tech play lately ?"
4485,i did a little last year but not recently . i went to illinois so i am a big 10 guy . do love the sec though . . . kind of hav veto .
4486,"i see , well it seems like the defense needs a complete make over , they have a terrible defies hopefully the team can get better this year ."
4487,wasnt ' 2017 a really good year in cmt ?
4488,"i thin they had a good campaign in 2020 , i think there performance wasnt as good on 2018 , so do you have a favorite nfl team ?"
4489,ia m a bears fan .
4490,"i see , too bad they didnt make it so the superbowl this year , when was the last time the bears made it ?"
4491,2006 . it was payton manning 's first superbowl . he was with the colts . devil chester had that opening kickoffs for a td and it was awesome ! i got so drunk that game .
4492,"that sounds like it was a great game indeed polo l , its amazing how teh advances and no wwe cant fell different data like the velocity , the rotation of hte ball among others with the use of a simple chip ."
4493,i wish football had the te tennis does . did you watch any of the australian open ?
4494,"i dont im not a big tennis fan , are a soccer or football fan myself"
4495,ok . . . the tennis tech is like the soccer tech when htey try to figure out a goal . cant fooball use that tech ? it would be so much quicker
4496,i agree though players have assoc hips we i think that is really advanced .
4497,yeah but i feel like it 's a waste if thy are not using them to further the gram . that use it for data and not game enhancement .
4498,"i can see your point , you know there is a high school football stadium that had a cost of a million dollars , what a waste o monty ! !"
4499,i bet it 's in texas ! theresa like 10 of them there . big oil money plus football crazy is 60m stadiums !
4500,"hopefully it didnt come out of drug money , we waste enormous amount o money on stadium we haven 4 of hte biggest stadiums on the world don a list of 25"
4501,jerry 's world should count twice !
4502,"hi , how are you ?"
4503,i 'm doing well . i 'm surprised kirk cousins was worth such a hug contract to other team s .
4504,i guess it depends on the fit of the us with the team and the coach .
4505,did you know the circular huddle was originally for a quarterback that was deaf so he could hear ?
4506,i thought it was to shield hte qb 's hand signals from the othe team .
4507,yeah . did you know that kellan moore one the only left handed qb in the nfl ?
4508,really ? is there something about being a lefty that skates it difficult on offense ?
4509,"i 'm not sure , it might be hard for them to succeed since o many players are used to right handers ."
4510,i wonder about locking assignments and receivers and such . there 's no rule against women playing in the nfl . i wonder if we 'll ever see a female on the field .
4511,"maybe , it depends . the average earnings of an engineer is higher than an nfl player on average ."
4512,probably safer for women to become engineers . ; our we need more engineers . they could improve the chips in the players shoulder pads .
4513,"crazy , i read tha they follow them that closely , i do n't know if it is worth it ."
4514,"it might help understand strategy , or cause and nature of injury ."
4515,this is true . but then again the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of game play .
4516,note such action . a lot of tim for commercials . a lot of standing around .
4517,that and a lot of finding with the play clock and running out the clock .
4518,"that 's true . the game has changed a lot . for example , in the 1960s , pro bowlers made more than football players ."
4519,"that 's insane , i be engineers made more than the average bowler back in the day too ; . sounds like being an engineer is the way to go ."
4520,"if you got the brain and the interest ! lot of people find it thouhg and boring . well , i enjoyed chatting !"
4521,nice chatting with you too !
4522,bye !
4523,hi how ar eyou ? do you like football ?
4524,"hi ! yes , i learned to like it with my husband an father in law . they are hardcore fans . lol about you ? i like to bears , um from illinois but my husband family like the chiefs"
4525,i am not really af an . i try to watch the playoffs and the super bowl . i like to root for the underdog .
4526,"i agree , m too ! i only watch it hen its on . i did watch the super bowl i know some people love brady some hat whim but tenure is no just he is amazing !"
4527,"i dont love or hate hi , particularly , but teh patriots seem to win a lot . i would like to see another team the a chance ."
4528,"right 2 this is the 6th super bowl the ' e won i think and i agree . there re a left of great players who ahve done great things for instance brad johnson , he threw a touchdown pass to himself ! ol he made it into history hes th only one to do that !"
4529,how on earth did he do that ? k want to see the footage of that .
4530,"haha , i know ! i didnt kow that was possible . . . maybe rules changed after tthat ; . there is also a left handed quarterback in the nfl , kellen moore , h eli state only one . im sure he has thrown some people off at first . there are a lot of interesting facts surrounding footbal , i must admit ."
4531,i guess the defense has to adjust to a new rhythm a different kind side .
4532,yes ! i now brady takes all the shine but there are alot of great ppl ; answers and coaches . like matt patricia . . . he is a rocket scientist besides a coach ! how cool !
4533,hem lot have a terrific mind to be able to do both . i envy him .
4534,me too ! i cant even leave my house . . . i have 2 year old wins ! can you imagine how loaded he must be . i wonder f eh is one of the highest paid coach of the service teams . apparently there are only 3 .
4535,"ok . i wonder about that too . th services have football teams , but are they competitive e ?"
4536,"im not sure , but if seems to be a l , ot of moeny las i expect especially since they humongous flags at football stadiums cost about 50 grand and weigh 1 , 100 pounds ."
4537,i ponder wht kind of cloth they are made out of . that 's realy heat be you could get trapped under that .
4538,"for sure , and a lot of money ! i would hate to be under that if it fell , its a very expensive and lucrative sport ."
4539,i stink that the focus if college hs shifted too much o sports . the money is driving these schools away from their focus l
4540,"i agree , there i sa high school stadium in texas tha cost over 60 mill to bundle !"
4541,"it is like epa megachurch dedicated to sport i anyway , great chat !"
4542,"yes , pretty must . it seats about 18 , 000 seems . its better than a concert ! a nd its only a high school . . . fun chatting with you too !"
4543,have a good day !
4544,"you too ! ascending you hugs find love to you lovely stranger ! hope you have an amazing day : ,"
4545,how are you doing ? do you like watching hte nfl ? surprisingly there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay .
4546,"i 'm great great , how ar eyou ? yes i love watching football and that blows my mind to think since we sit and watch a game fo hours !"
4547,yes half the time i feel like i 'm watching commercials . i 'm still waiting for the first woman to play in the nfl because there is no written rule against dig .
4548,"that rule be a great day for society 21 i wonder waht position she would try out for , kicker ?"
4549,"yeah kicker if she was smaller but maybe it receiver if she was a bigger . one thing is for certain , i would n't want to be a cheerleader for the nw orleans saints because they ca n't eat it the same restaufrnat as the players ."
4550,imagine getting a steak an then having to leave because somebody came in . that is crazy tom e ! i do like the nfl technology though !
4551,"yeah you bring up a good point they have a lot of technology at their disposal . they even have chips inside og the footballs to track velocity , rotation , ball spewed , and location ."
4552,players can have their every move stacked on the field as well ! espn oven won an emmy for that yellow line we see on the field haha .
4553,oh wow ! i wonder if they track the quarterbacks every movement ? i also wonder if a lefthanded hard different movements then a right had a quarterback . kellan moore would now .
4554,"is n't he the only left handed quarterback in the league right now ? the only others one i can think of are brunei , steve young , a nd michael vick !"
4555,yeah are used to like watching michael vick . bu ti think he is the only current one now . quarterback spare so important . baker mayfield almost quit football to become a competitive video game player .
4556,"i 'm sure he 's happy he change did mind . f he keeps it up , he ? ll be making much much more than he would have playing video games !"
4557,yes god point . although not as much as an engineer !
4558,"i guess if htey take all the players that one play on your two years into that average , i do believe engineers in fact make more int heir lifetime !"
4559,"yes that is very surprising , it must be because the nfl players career is so short . top bowlers in the 1960s used t make more than top football players as well ."
4560,"i think i would ave loved being a bowler back then , but yet again , how much his more for payment back then ?"
4561,yeah i 'm ot sure that 's a good question ! ther eis only one running back i have ever hear of that has never fumbled the football and hat is been benjarvus greenellis who played for the patriots .
4562,"that is a crazy stat because he played in the league for years ! these days , it 's common for a running back to fumble like every other game ! i wonder how many fumbles were in the 2220 game back in 86 lol ."
4563,wow what s beating that was . georgia tech must 've been really good or cumberland must 've been really ad . well it was nice chatting with you today !
4564,i think i would have just walked off the field at that point . it was nice chatting with you as well !
4565,"have a good saturday , see ya !"
4566,"hi , how are you ?"
4567,good and you ?
4568,i 'm fine ! shall we chat about football ?
4569,sure . do you know much about footbal l ? i confess i only have a basic knowledge of the sport .
4570,"i only know a little myself . for example , the huddle is such a fundamental part of the game that i did n't even think about btw origins . haul d . hubbard created the huddle in today 's football . reason : he 's deaf quarterback . he did n't want the other team to read his hand signals ."
4571,i wonder if any of the main signals have an significance in asl since here are deaf and hard of hearing players on the teams .
4572,"that 's a good point . in the 60s bowlers made twice as much as football stars . still , i wonder how much bowlers made overall . was it that much money ?"
4573,i think back then the player i the nfl even ' ; t getting the exorbitant sum they how now . given all the injuries they sustain though i think the only is mostly justified .
4574,"on a perminute basis , they make a great wage . there is only 11 minutes of action on average ."
4575,that has to be without the huddles and hikes . all that because there is a clock that ticks down . i think it must be 11 minutes of actual moving .
4576,"did you know that there is only one lefthanded quarterback in the nfl ? kellan moore . i expected more , considering how many lefty pitchers there are in the mlb ."
4577,i did n't know that . i wonder if it i because of the way the ball is thrown andc might . it seems like it would be harder to do lefthanded than with say a baseball .
4578,i wonder if the plays have to be reported for a very . the receiver routes and such
4579,i would imagine so . it is hard to catch things from a lefty . everything is always just a bit off .
4580,"the nfl has no rules against women playing . i stunk that women could p , ay at certain positions , like kicker . women would probably draw a lot of interest , perhaps increase the tv audience ."
4581,if a woman is kicker does she still have to meet the same requirements as the other players ?
4582,"i suppose there is a lot of competition for kicker , so it would be tough . plus there is no feeder system like for men . women soccer players might qualify ."
4583,i would think that when it comes to kicker there woul be more crossover between footbal and soccer . i think there woudl be alot less missed field goals .
4584,"if there were a compelling case for a women , i think a team would have her . well , its lee agreat chatting wath you ! have a good day ! enjoy football !"
4585,yes a has been very educational . i learned quite a bit about t .
4586,thanks !
4587,do you like to watch football ?
4588,"i love watching football , how abou thou ?"
4589,"it 's not my favorite sports to watch , honestly . i prefer to watch soccer , tennis , skiing , ice skating . but that 's just me . what is your favorite football team ?"
4590,"i like the vikings and the university of iowa for college , you ?"
4591,"honestly , i 'm not sure . maybe the patriots because i 'm from new england ? but honestly , the have won a log and i like underdog teams ."
4592,i like underdog teams too . did you ever hear about iowa and their pink locker room for their opponents ?
4593,i have . i am not sure how i feel about that . i think its stupid and sexist . they should instead paint it some bright neon distracting color .
4594,"i then they use pink fot psychology purposes , but sexism . it is a natural calming color and it is used to relax the other team"
4595,really ? hm . did you know the nfl has ho written rule against female players ?
4596,"i did not know that , i wonder why there has n't been a women playing before , np steven a kicker"
4597,"i think it is because they still have to meet the league ? s liability requirements . speaking of sexism tho , new orleans saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in th sesame restaurant as any nfl player . if they are eating in a restaurant and ann fil player enters , they are required to leave . crazy !"
4598,"i heard tha t , that is sexism 101 ! i wonder why no one has taken them to court over that . now is thet game to end that"
4599,"yes . imagine you are in the middle of eating your meal , and you have to leave because an in football player walked in ?"
4600,"right , that is not cool at all . let them enjoy their meals !"
4601,"seriously . bike i can imagine a rule against socializing with football players of the opposite team , but to ahve to leave the restaurant is absurd ."
4602,that is true things need to change . did you hear about tracking chips in shoulder pads for players now ?
4603,i have heard about that . makes sense . did they not have them before ' deflategate ' . lol
4604,"maybe they were create because of that lol ! i bet they were created by engineers who mark more , money in their lifetime than most nfl players"
4605,"that is surprising , but then i guess if player have a short career time while engineers have a long career ."
4606,"for sure , i should have dreamed to b and engineer as a kid ! it was so nice chatting with you !"
4607,"but then , good for the engineers , because being line requires a lot of skill and knowledge . and it 's very important for keeping everyone in society safe ."
4608,"for sure , have a great weekend and joy your day !"
4609,do you watch the nfl ?
4610,yes i do . do you like brady ?
4611,yes i do did you know he was a backup qb in high school ?
4612,yeah and he was never started even they were not doing well
4613,yeah . do you know who alex smith is ?
4614,yes he is the qb hat finished college in two years
4615,yeah heat cook roots of ap tests in high school
4616,yeah smart kids really planned ahead of time
4617,yeah . do you know who invented the circular huddle ?
4618,yes it was paul hubbard who was deaf and did not want the other team to understand him
4619,yeah cool trick . baker mayfield wanted to quit football pro become a gamer
4620,wow better that he did not . do you you u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pin k ?
4621,yes and i wonder if it is supposed to have some effect n thom
4622,i wonder too . in the 60s bowlers made more than football playes
4623,yea dig less it was not as popular of a sport back hen
4624,true . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
4625,yes that was 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
4626,yeah that was back in 1916 and thati as quite something
4627,yeah . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
4628,yes for the superimposed yellow line
4629,yeah it has made game matching much easier for us
4630,i enjoy the nfl . how about yourself ?
4631,"i do to , but do n't really follow the nfl . . . but wish i could !"
4632,sometimes it 's difficult with so many games . did you know that ther ware no written rules against female players ?
4633,"really ? tha 's took . i wonder if there will ever be any female players in the nfl , like maybe a quarterback ! haha"
4634,"they still have to meet requirements and with the size of those men i kind of doubt it . while i a glad they do nit have rules against female players , i am angered by the sexist way in this 'the saints treat their players ."
4635,i agree ! being forbidden to eat in the same place as they do is ridiculous . they even have to leave if they were there 1st ! football can have some crazy rules oven outside of the game .
4636,you got it but i mean to say payers not cheerleaders even though they are team players in their own way . yes i do not understand why they would have to stop eating and leave . that 's ridiculous and i ca n't think of a single goo reason for it . it seems humiliating .
4637,"oh , gotcha . yes it is definitely insane if you ask , . very humiliating ! i do like how the university of iowa painter the locker room pink for visitors haha , crazy !"
4638,that seems likes ome kind of psychological warfare . did you know that in the nfl they us tracking chips on players and footballs to track their every move ? i wonder why they do n't use that to make calls instead of just relying gon reviews ?
4639,"wow , did n't know that , but i agree ! it would make sense ! there was a patriot 's player who never fumbled the football in his nfl carter . . . if they were tracking maybe that would change ! i bet he was an excellent player though ."
4640,that was benjarvus greenellis . i believe he was a rb .
4641,"exactly 2 so do you have a favorite team or player in the nfl ? i like the quarterback , they are such an important part . the game ."
4642,i liken he bears . their ne wb needs some work . how about yourself ?
4643,"i got ta stay witch my home team qb , josh robin . . . i know , they are not the best but hey , i love them ."
4644,teh 've certainly had their moments over the last few years . are you familiar with alex smith ?
4645,they have had there moment s ! is he the guy the got his bachelor 's degree in 2 years ? and became the 1s overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft ?
4646,yes he did . he entered college as a junior nd was working on his master 's when drafted . he 's a very smart iman .
4647,"wow , i do remember that . very smart to get that education . just like baker mayfield . . . . he is an excellent video game player . he even considered quitting football to play video game !"
4648,it out certainly be easier on his body . he could always do it later . are you familiar with kellan moore ?
4649,right ! those players get beat up some games . is n't kellen a qb ?
4650,yes he is and the only left handed one in the league .
4651,do you like football ? i read that tom brady in highschool jv team was neveda allowed to play and now he is the super owl champion
4652,i love football . glad the playoffs are here but is the season is drawing to a close too
4653,i read that the circular huddle was created by paul d . hubbard who was deaf and he wanted to make sure it teammates could his rand signals
4654,that is true . who do you think will nl representing the afc and nfc in the super bowl this year .
4655,i think maybe the saint and chiefs
4656,are you a fan of either team ?
4657,yes i like the saints . what about you ? did you know that the nfl has o written rule against female players
4658,i hope to see one at least as a kicker in the nfl soon . i like the saints too
4659,an article i read says that he nfl gem only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
4660,"yeah , they are too busy showing us a to generate revenue ."
4661,speaking of saints . the cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player
4662,"thats a bit hypocritical if the team and the only given heirs stance against violence against women , don ' thou think ?"
4663,"yes , i find it quite odd . it also says that even if they are already eating at a restaurant and one of the football players come in the cheerleaders are required to leave"
4664,"o woul like to see hte nfl season extended by giving another bye week , especially if games are being played overseas"
4665,that would have sense . i saw that an engineer lifetime earnings are higher than an average nfl player
4666,i find that hard to believe give nthe enormity of some of the nfl contracts these days
4667,that is actually what i was thinking . i saw that espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line hat represents teh first down line for median footbal games
4668,"yeah , maybe they will get another one for the projected wield goal line hey have nowadays for next years awards"
4669,i saw that the highest score ever in a football game was when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 they mush ave bee ba relaly bad team
4670,i thought the colts were going to score that many during the houston game yesterday . . . l ; ol
4671,lol . . i feel bad for that team back n 1913 . it must have been a depressing game to play
4672,time to watch the football games !
4673,good evening . do you liek footbal ?
4674,i do like football . do you have a favorite quarterback ?
4675,al time joe montana . did you know the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink
4676,i did n't . that 's an interesting tactic . i think it 's pretty interesting tha ten roethlisberger is the winningest quarterback in the cleveland browns stadium .
4677,that is an interesting fact . i also read that the cehereladers from thas saints cajun not eat in the same restaurant the players are in
4678,i 've actually heard bout such restrictions . seems a little antiquated to me . did you know that russell wilson is still under a mlb contract even thouhg he has n't played in a regular season game since 2011 . he got traded to teh yankees this year l
4679,wow . i wonde how that was possible ? i dont know much about baseball
4680,seems an odd thing to do . his contract must not be worth every cha nad maybe they hope he 'll retire prom football and start playing baseball again . wilson is also only one of my africanamerican quarterbacks to have won a super bowl .
4681,did you know that an average nfl game only ahs 11 minutes of live gameplay
4682,that is amazing . i guess it makes sense . they apparently have chips in the players shoulder pads and the footballs to record movements and other statistics .
4683,i did read about that . former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career r .
4684,i actually had no idea . brad johnson is the only quarterback in nfl history to throw a touchdown pass lo himself . i 'd like to see some video of that !
4685,"that old be an amazing video . the circular huddle used in todays america football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other tea could not read his hand signals ."
4686,clever . kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl . i guess football does n't attract left handers like baseball does .
4687,i did not know that . did you know there is no written rules against female players
4688,"if i had to gues be 'd probably see a female kicker first . speaking of firsts , the first nfl game was played in 1932 inside chicago stadium ."
4689,did you know tom brady was a backup quarter back who wa never played by his team and they never on a game
4690,"well , i bet they wish that hey had played him now . matt patricia is the only rocket scientist coaching in the nfl ."
4691,here 's something crazy the highest score week in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220
4692,poor cumberland . college football teams have some of the largest stadium in the world . in fact 14 of the world 's 25 largest stadiums are college football teams .
4693,you would think it would be the professional stadiums .
4694,"you would , not the 're note . high school football stadiums re also somewhat out of control . there is a high school football stadium in texas that seats , , 000 ."
4695,aoc that 's amazing . well texas is a big late .
4696,it is and i there ie anywhere that thay love football it is certainly texas . high school football 9s a really big deal in certain areas . snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son 's high school football take .
4697,i read that about snoop dog . have a great night .
4698,"hi , how are you ?"
4699,"he , lo everything good , do you like football ? i didnt now theres as no rule against a female player ."
4700,i do like football . i was shocked about that too . and that they average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay
4701,"yeah that seems unreal as a game tend to last really long , that might explain why an engineer would eventually earn more than a player ."
4702,i thought it was because the average career lisa 2 yeas vs an engineers beings 30 years . do you have a favorite team ?
4703,"yeah that could be it , i do have a favorite team i love the patriots i became a van with the rb benjarvus greenellis , cray how he never fumbled , what about you ?"
4704,"the saints . new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating int he same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave ."
4705,"thats kind of demeaning , thay shouldnt be a rule . what is you favorite football position ?"
4706,i like the tight end . the about you ?
4707,"i like am , i just like ho whe seems to be the leader of the team , i like tom brady ."
4708,i may like the te but i do love baker mayfield . i love his shaggy . . .
4709,"he is a great player , did you know he considered quitting football once to persue a gaming carreer ?"
4710,really ? i did not . i know he left texas tech na went on tc oklahoma as a walk ion .
4711,"yeah , it seems like hew is a really skilled named , he beat anyone in halo 3 no one could beat him at his college"
4712,wow . that crazy . do you play video games liken hat ?
4713,"yes i do like to lay halo 3 and other video games , what about you ;"
4714,i used to play modern warfare all the time and then i got married and my priorities shifted . really haven ' played since then .
4715,"yeah that is a good game , i like it as well . i also like the hidden game"
4716,"i used to love madden . i stopped playing for like 15 years and when i returned , i got mollywhopped . it was sad . . ."
4717,"i cna imagine lol , if you stop practicing then your skills can be seriously hurt . i was pretty good as well i think even a 5 year old can beat me now ."
4718,"nl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track ; l velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
4719,hi . do you like football at all ?
4720,"hello here , i do like football , i usually follow pretty closely during the season . how abot you ?"
4721,me too . have you watched patrick mahomes soft he kansas city chiefs ?
4722,"i have , i was hoping that he would have gone to the superb owl this season . how about yu ?"
4723,i 'm a new england patriots fan so i 'm glad tthat he didnt but he will go to the super bowl eventually with the numbers that he put in this season .
4724,"yeah you sure are glad then , your tema has been dominating the last decade or s i would say . speaking of qb 's , do you know who the only left handed one , the league is ?"
4725,i believe it kellan moore but i 'm no sure .
4726,"good la ! yeah it 's him , i am surprised ther ware n't more . did you know baker mayfield is an excellent video game player ?"
4727,yes . i heard somewhere that he is a very good halo 3 player nad that he thought of quitting football to pursue full time competitive gaming .
4728,"yeah that was it , halo 3 , have you eve rplaue4d any of the halo games , i used to play the first halo back when i as at school ."
4729,i loved halo 3 and i use to play it all the time a few years ago .
4730,"k do n't think i have ever played that one , 1 and 2 i did . speaking of qb ? s again , do you know which one infested the modern huddle ?"
4731,i believe of i 'm not mistaken it was paul d . hubbard .
4732,"good call again ! yeah and he was a deaf quarterback as well , so that is even cooler !"
4733,wow i didn ? t know that he was a fb that is amazing ! ! !
4734,do you know what the highest score of ny football game ever was ?
4735,i think it was something like 2220 and it happen long time ago .
4736,"yeah it was , way back in 1916 . poor cumberland lost to georgia tech , sounds like it was never even a game ."
4737,yeah ! ! ! it appears that game was over very quick .
4738,"yeah sure does , wonder how many cumberland fans were left when the final whistle blew ."
4739,yeah ! ! ! i bet not that many that 's for sure .
4740,and only the die hard cumberland ones too lol .
4741,yeah ! ! it was a very embarrassing performance by them that day .
4742,"yeah and that 's an understatement . anyways , its been fun talking , i the you enjoy the rest of your night ."
4743,"he ; lo there , do you follow the nfl at all ?"
4744,i love te nfl and i do too it every week when in season .
4745,"yeah i follow as well , mostly my team , but more so when the playoffs come around ."
4746,who is your team in the nfl ?
4747,"i follow the packers , was a big brett favre fan , how about you ? do you ahve a team that you follow ?"
4748,i 'm a big new england patriots fan . we just won the superbowl against a not spot tough ; a rams team .
4749,"nice ! i was hoping or a bit more scoring during the game , but it got very exciting near the end ."
4750,yes it did with the rams running out of gas . do you know by any chance how many minutes does the average nfl game has ?
4751,i think i read somewhere it was like 1 minutes or something on average of actual game play .
4752,you 're correct . do you know if female players can play in the nfl ?
4753,"that is right ! t here i not rule about female players , i think it would be so cool if one did make a roster at played ."
4754,that woul be very nice . did you know that the mayfield considered quitting football at one point ?
4755,"i think i heard that he was really good at video games so that might be why he thought bout quitting , am i right t ?"
4756,yes that is correct . he is a very good halo 3 player .
4757,"yeah i think you ; re right , did you ever play any of those halo games ?"
4758,i did and i think i was pretty good .
4759,"speaking of football , did you hear that espn once won an emmy or football ?"
4760,no . i did n't know . do you happen to know for what they won emmy ?
4761,"yeah it was way back when they started putting stat yellow it in to show where the first down yard line was , it is help a lot i will say ."
4762,wow that is very nice . i do agree with you . do you happen to know who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
4763,"right now , i think it 's kellan moore , but i could be wrong ."
4764,you 're correct . its is allan moore . well it was very nice chatting with you today . i hope you have a nice night ! ! !
4765,"nice ! yeah same to you , i hope you have a good nigh t ."
4766,"hello , are you a fan of american football ?"
4767,"yes , i am huge american football fan . are you ?"
4768,"i am somewhat , i mainly fo , low insteresting facts about it . i 'm in new england , i never knew how bad tom brady 's high school team was !"
4769,ye s ! tom brady has come a long way from junipero serra high school football . i 'm curious what alex smith studied when he was at university .
4770,"that 's true , i heard hew base so mad he got a bachelor 's degree in two years all before declaring for the draft ! guess it really does pay to take ap classes huh ."
4771,"smith has plenty of options is the whole football thing does n't work for im . just like baker mayfield , who could become a fulltime competitive gamer"
4772,"that 's interesting though , i wonder if that would have been a better option . a lot of quarterbacks are unique , i heard kellan moore is the nfl 's only left handed quarterback ."
4773,it woud be really unique if a woman was playing football . there are no rules against women playing as long they meet the eligibility requirements
4774,"shocking , especially considering i would say th league has n't successfully represented itself as not sexist . i know in new orleans , saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if football players come in to eat after team ."
4775,thay 's incredibly disappointing . even the university of iowa paints the visiting teams ' locker room pink .
4776,"i bet that does n't really have people at this point , at least it should n't . at least things are improving more than they are getting worse , i believe they use tracking chips in shoulder pads to better track payers and learn ."
4777,i like your positivity ! it 's important to innovate . yes ; n eve for an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line .
4778,i bet that would n't have happened back wheat hey did n't care about football as much . i think in the 60 's bowlers got paid ore somehow .
4779,"good point . football is so risky . over their lifetime , an engineer would make more than the average nfl or mlb player . it 's a much safer route !"
4780,"tat 's certainly a shame , hands surprising . i feel the should get incentives for exceptional play . benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the football his entire career , tha should certainly be worth som money ."
4781,that is talented . th bucs should look at signing him . especially i they fore everyone after their 819 loss to the bears
4782,"oh yeah that 's an embarrasing loss for sure . still it can get worse , i heard the worst loss ever was 2220 , i ca n't imagine showing up after losing by that much ."
4783,"well ryan fitzpatrick is still employed y the bucs , e won though he was bunched for james winston is what terrible loss ."
4784,"i heard james winston has done some terrible things though , like he was investigated after roping a uber driver . i do n't feel comfortable with him being employed either !"
4785,if true m that sort of behavior can not be tolerated . eve if she was drafted by no . 1 by tampa bay in 2016 .
4786,"definitely , he 'd ho ; e players do n't get preferential treatment just based on how valuable they are to the game . anyway , it was nice talking to you , have a nice day !"
4787,are you a fan of hte nfl ?
4788,ia m ! my favorite tema is the llamas cowboys . what about you ?
4789,"i am a vikings fan , but not religiously . goods in you are n't a saints fan , did you hear how they treat their cheerleaders ?"
4790,i actually did ! i would ' be one an agree to leave a restaurants imply because an nfl player decided took eat there too . it kind that 's ridiculous !
4791,"right , very sexist , i hop other teams do n't do it . i wonder what the reason is"
4792,"i 'm guessing , but probably o prevent dating 'the nfl players and socializing with them ."
4793,right an distracting them before big games . did you know the nfl only has like 10 minutes of actual gameplay
4794,that 's crazy since a game typically takes 2 hours or so to actually complete . football actually can real to a number of different sports depending on what country or region you use the word ' football ' .
4795,even 3 hours sometimes lol . i know football is soccer everywhere else besides phd us lol
4796,"actually , it can refer to rugby , australian rules football , and gaelic football as well as soccer . so many variations !"
4797,"wow , that is so many variations ! do you have a favorite quarterback ?"
4798,"my favorite qb used to be troy aikman until i he him and learned how mj of an arrogant , rude , inconsiderate person he is . my husband loves tom brady . you ?"
4799,"yikes scary , i never knew that about troy aikman ! that stinks ! tom brady iss o good !"
4800,"yeah , but i still love emit smith , he was humble and nice ? tom brady is good ! he has 6 super bowl rings ego prove it !"
4801,"lol sure , did you know in high school though , tom bradys jv team never won a game and the coach refused to put him in !"
4802,haha ! well he is probably regretting that decision !
4803,i bet lol . do you follow college football ?
4804,"ot very much . my husband does though , so we watch a play a lot nd he likes to wathc sony michel with the patriots ."
4805,"nice , good team ! i am an iowa hawkeye fan , did you ever about heir locker room ?"
4806,oh yes ! ! ! i heard the visitor 's locker room in painted pink ! ! ! haha i think that 's awesome !
4807,"right , it is psychology 101 basically ! great chatting with you ! enjoy your day !"
4808,"hi , how are y'all tonight ?"
4809,i 'm still depressed what the patriots won teh nfl super bowl .
4810,why ? di you polos money on a wager o something ?
4811,i hate the patriots because they win every year . i like the redskins n't they ca n't keep up quarterback with two working legs .
4812,legs are overrated . they got that controversial mascots . that will let hem noticed ! perhaps they could paint the visitor 's locker room pink ?
4813,"yes the university of iowa did that . it was different 2 back in the 1960s the top bowlers made twice as much as football stars , crazy !"
4814,"i think hte bowlers probably bribed them tv people ! football is a better sport , objectively and biblicfally !"
4815,certainly a lot of tech has come about from football espn won an emmy fort he yellow superimposed line
4816,"for the u of iowa , i think they do a pink line for visitors ."
4817,laugh ! the nfl even uses tracking chips in the players shoulder pads as well as inside the football .
4818,maybe it 's to make sure some art n't posing as men .
4819,actually women are allowed to play nfl football
4820,no ! i ca n't believe there is n't anything in the rules ! check again !
4821,you must ve from new orleans where the cheerleaders are not even allowed to eat in the same restaurant as a nfl player
4822,perhaps it 's to prevent fraternization of a lot of played can be distracted by cheerleaders .
4823,that is why the engineers earn more money than an average nfl player noted distracted by any girls !
4824,"engineering , like football , is a profession mostly taken usb y men , so i 'm sure some would be distracted by women in their cars r ."
4825,trust me the girls do n't watch to dale engineers you must b tone !
4826,"if i am an engineer , then women wo n't date me . if women wo n't date me , the i 'm an engineer ? whereas re my earnings then ? well , i enjoyed chatting !"
4827,well 11 minutes of gameplay in the standard nfl game is about how long we chatted .
4828,"i did not earn as much , unfortunately . may the officials be on your side , sir ."
4829,yes perhaps take up bowling and make some more cash . good night !
4830,"the golf is a professional american fopbtapl league consisting of 32 teams , all the player are eager to lift the trophy ."
4831,some just never here to get close . lol
4832,"the nfl has no written . , e against female players l women woud able to met the league eligibility requirement got he first evidence of women playing football is organized in 1926 ."
4833,"yeah , there is gaelic football which some women play too ."
4834,"the team won the most championship is green bay packers , with 13 wins the digest afterwards , super bowl with 9 wins ."
4835,i am surprised it isnt hte patriots . they have won 6 alone with tom brady as th eb .
4836,yeah . pittsburgh steelers also won 6 wins . all the team and coach working hard to lift the trophy .
4837,"did you hear about that one game in 1916 , 2220 . crazy score . georgia tech was definitely working hard there ."
4838,i feel sad for cumberland . it was the greatest in the history forever . people never forget this defeat .
4839,"i dont even understand how a score can get that high , there are usually only 1 minutes of active game play per game ."
4840,yeah do i also feel the same . nfl uses tracking chips in the player shoulder pads to record their movement in the field . this shows how aggressive ti lift the trophy .
4841,i think they also use the data to prevent player injury and to improve the pads themselves . which is cool
4842,they tracking hte ball spree dad how players react in the pressure situation .
4843,"i bet it changes things for kellan moore , hes the only southpaw in the nfl"
4844,"yeah . sports commonly called footbal in certain places include association football . it is also a team sports , many countries like this game ."
4845,which is what teh us like to call soccer . it is a . great game .
4846,"in modern american footbal l , teh quarterback is considered as the lead of the offensive team . quarterback can also pick ."
4847,the was once a deaf quarterback that actually created he modern day circular huddle .
4848,it is very interesting .
4849,"may , he didnt want the opposing team seeing his hand signals ."
4850,such tactics are also the part of the game . he want to win the game of hs team .
4851,"alex smith did as well , he suck around after earning his degree and started work on a masters ."
4852,the cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the sam restaurant as any nfl player and if the player comes cheerleaders ar asked to take leave the restaurant .
4853,i think that is horrible . that is no way to treat people .
4854,they are focusing on their game . to avoid distraction .
4855,what does eating at a restaurant have to do with the same ?
4856,the nfl regular season starts from early september fo late december . each team played 16 games with each other .
4857,"that series like a long time . its been nice chatting , but i 've ot to get going . have a nice day"
4858,"hi , how are you ?"
4859,"good , do you follow footbal ? the ravens did petty good against the raiders offense , matt judopn had 3 sacks"
4860,"k do n't know the football too good . the sacks are a good thing , yes ?"
4861,"yea , matt hudson also had the tackles against the raiders too , he had an awesome game"
4862,the man has the raiders ' number .
4863,"yea , baltimore ususally has great defenses , they are average allowing 1 . 6 points per drive"
4864,that is so tiny ! teh are though to play . i guess they are the species of death for most offices .
4865,well cumberland could have used a miracle back in 1916 when they lost to georgia tech 2220
4866,"i think that the cumberland guys took a dive . they were n't supposed to lose that bad , but they wanted to win a bet . shameful ."
4867,"maybe . there 's a running back who has never fumbled a football in his career , benjarvusgreen ellis , he played for new engaged"
4868,mr be plus is a legend . he must have a secret technique . or huge hands . or special gloves .
4869,i wonder if the tracking chips embedded in players ' equipment could reveal the secrets
4870,the tracking chips would be a good way to unlock the secrets of all the concussion teh players suffer . i would like to know what they do with the data .
4871,it 's crazy that the engineers who design them make more i na lifetime on average than the average nfl player
4872,th engineers do n't suffer injuries or concussions either . i figure it 's a good gig .
4873,"yes , it 's pretty crazy thay top bowlers made more than football stars back in the 1960s"
4874,i wonder how much that actually was . did they make money from endorsement for mayonnaise and pizza ? or beer ?
4875,"do knows , i wonder if they hve many left hand bowlers , the nfl only has one left handed qb , kellan moore"
4876,"rib n't hey do have lefthanded bowlers . qbs ? probably there 's an issue with the plays or soemthing . anyway , great chat !"
4877,"you too , i 'm gon na catch some football on espn and their emmy winning yellow line"
4878,that is a good idea . have a good night !
4879,you too
4880,"i do n't watch football much , but i have to admit that i do pay some attention to the regular nfl season and playoffs"
4881,do you live in a city with one of the 32 nfl teams ?
4882,"i do , actually , and that 's the team i usually pay attention to . especially since if there 's a home game on a day that i wo , it can affect the traffic on my commute home . i would n't ever try out for the nfl , though there 's no written rule against females"
4883,theresa re 16 team in the afc and 16 in the nfc . which one i sin your city ?
4884,"won . they did better this year than usual , though the singleleimination in the playoffs stopped them from going to the super bowl"
4885,"i se , ia m in an nfc city . we did so poorly that we get the number one draft pick this year . kind 'the browns established themselves in clever ; and , the winningest qb has been a pittsburgh steelers , not a brown 's qb"
4886,"the qb definitely has a lot to do with how well a team does . though since an nfl game only has about 11 of live gameplay , i wonder how much of it is used by the qb"
4887,the qb touches the ball on every play some i would guess at least one third of te gameplay . he holds it longer on a pass than on a handoff . your team bowled out because the playoffs are indeed single elimination . i wish ot like baseball .
4888,"definitely no t , though best out of seven is a lot to watch and causes even more traffic than the playoff soo . whether it 's the nfl pr ml b , thye average engineer is stil likely to make more money in a lifetime than the average player . though qb 's are typically above average"
4889,my next door neighbor was a running back and made 7 million in one season to i started as an engineer and mad about 4 . 5 million in my career . one of us is not average ! . there is one high school stadium in texas thati of 60 million to build .
4890,he must have been a good player . 've are those texans really love their football . i wonder how many in the nfl draft actually came from a high school line texas compared to other states
4891,"i 'll bet it id high . highs school football on a friday night ia huge int was . that stadium seat sq , 000"
4892,"players on that team are probably used to playing under a lot of pressure . i wonder how in the stadium was when georgia tech beat cumberland 2200 back in 1916 ? then again , that game would have gotten boring seeing all those touchdowns from the same team !"
4893,it would be liek watching a horror movie . i was on a high school jv team that lost to the varsity of a smaller scool by 740 . they ran the clock in the second half even on incomplete passes . there needs to be a mercy rule .
4894,"maybe that 's why the score was so high . there was a high school jv team taht not only lost , but failed to score a touchdown the whole season . the backup qb , whom they never put in , w as tom brady . big mistake there"
4895,taht is a story for he ages . the 3 highest paid employees in the department of defense are the football coaches a 'the service academies .
4896,"of course they are . football is where the money is now . though some , like baker mayfield , almost quit football to do competitive gaming . i guess he stuck to it as the ' of the university of oklahoma"
4897,i went to oklahoma . he did stay and won the heisman trophy . he could beat anyone on the team in halo .
4898,i guess we 'll never know how he would have done in teh world of competitive gaming . paul d . hubbard was a deaf quarterback and created the circular huddle so he could signs to his teammates without the other team seeing
4899,necessity does cause inventions . the first nfl game sas on an 80 yard along dirt field .
4900,stat sun like the kind of fields i 've played flag football in !
4901,"hell , do you enjoy football ?"
4902,"yes , i like it especially out at the live games where you can really get the feel from it . i heard about jonathan petermanw ho completed 5 out of 81 passes for 24 yards and two interceptions a 0 . 0 passer rating while getting slacked three times before getting benched . gee ."
4903,"wow , id o too ! i love going to the games ! ! that is quiet a performance ! !"
4904,"well , a lot of other women know a lot more than me about it . but , i do know that the sport commonly called football in certain places includes association football which is known as soccer in most countries . in america , we love what is called gridiron football ."
4905,"yes , i know . association football is soccer . it can get confusing if your not familiar wit hit ! !"
4906,"that 's the truth . there are a number of references to traditional , ancient , or prehistoric ball games played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world . we love our games !"
4907,"true , did you know the buffalo bills ar sequel to the new england patriots in superbowl loses ! !"
4908,ifr remember hearing that . something else i recently learned about football is that the league consists o 32 teams which aired divided equally between the nfc andc the afc . i didnt catch on to that befoee .
4909,i had heard that too 2 very interesting . . . how talented is benjarvus greenellis in his nfl career to have never fumbled the football ?
4910,"yes , he must have very sticky hands . lol . another interesting football fact is that an average nfl ga , me only that 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
4911,after young to so many games i believe it ! ! lots of time to run to bathroom or get a treat ! ! lol
4912,"i was surprised , it must seems to take so long for the game to be over . ne technology might help though . nfl now uses tracking chips embedded in the players ' shoulder pads to record a players every move on hte field ."
4913,"yes , that 's a great thing to have ! have you heard the author of th games of thrones calls teh ne england patriot the lannisters of the nfl ?"
4914,"was , i 've heard that too . did you know tat kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl at this time ?"
4915,"i would think there woul the more than one at this tme q ! who knew ? , went handed people are special ! !"
4916,"another interesting fact is that the circular huddle used in today 's american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so that the other team could not read hi hand signal ; s . amazing ."
4917,"very good idea , specially if your hard of hearing . do you like avocado icecream ? tom brady loves it !"
4918,it 's actually very cream and sweet if you make it correctly . go tom brady and the new england patriot to i like him . did you hear that the highest score ever in a football game occured ink 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 to 0 ?
4919,"really , i haven ' tried it yet , but i like avocado so i think i would if there is enough sugar . hard to understand da score getting that high ! i just have seemed forever for hte losing team ."
4920,"i know , right ? did you also hear that alex smith took so many ap texts in high school that he entered the university as a junior ? he received his bachelor 's degree in two years . that was quick !"
4921,"he must be a fan learner . maybe he 's got photographic memory ! yes , go tom brady and the patriots , they have a devoted group of fans ! ! good chat !"
4922,"thank you , i thought o to . have a great night ."
4923,"good thing that jaguars decided against cousins , he wants too much money . do you watch football ?"
4924,yes i do ! curt cousins is greed and selfish
4925,"he used to play here for the redskin it i think he is a good qb , but i 'm surprised by how much salary h commands ."
4926,"well , there are not many qbs o choose from , som be that 's why"
4927,"teach , i can see that . it did n't make a difference for washington though . they have n't been very good since they were owned by san snyder"
4928,yeah that 's for sure ! that 's crazy that kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl
4929,"it sort of reminds me of pitches aww sell . lefty 's are pretty rare to begin with , and easier to bt against if you are a high dance . but still only 1 left handed in the nfl seems reall small ; ."
4930,yup ! how about tom brady ever getting to part on his hs losing season ?
4931,i did n't know tha . he 's a really good qb . he also is rarely injured . i think that is a big part of being successful .
4932,"definitely is ! i like blue bortles , he actually lived in th tow i live in"
4933,"ones pretty good . i live in hte dc area , it is not uncommon to see the players out at some of th locals sports bars . i 've seen cousins out multiple times ,"
4934,oh that 's cool ! i would love to see a female kicker i nthe nfl
4935,it would be interesting . i 'm sure thee are robbery a few qualified candidates .
4936,i am sure too ! can you believe only 21 minutes sofa actual playing time ?
4937,"yeah , i can believe it . the plays happen pretty quickly . when i was in high school there was a girl on the football team ."
4938,oh yeah ? my high school had a girl on the team and a boy on the cheerelaxder team ! lol
4939,george w . bush was a game cheerleader for his college i think . i did n't know that engineer 's make more than the average ml players . nfl i can believe .
4940,"well , they need to do a better rob at spreading out their salaries over ti , e instead of living in access"
4941,"yeah , i also think they do n't save and invest their earnings properly over tie and it hurts them in the long run . clinton portia now drives an uber here around in dc ."
4942,really ? wow . . . talk about poor money management ! funny how a saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if a saints player comes in
4943,"yeah , they have all kinds of rules like that for cheerleaders . one the players have in dc , cruise cooler , gt in trouble for marrying a cheerleader from the team ."
4944,crazy ! well i am not . . . in fun ! take care ! go eagles ! ! 2 ! lol
4945,are you familiar with football and the nl ?
4946,"love football but do n't get yo watch it at all , hoping to see some of the sb this sunday"
4947,so you must know has the nfl is one of the four major professional sports league in north america
4948,9 did i also heard there no written rule that sleeps women from playing .
4949,"indeed , i was especially surprised the average nfl game only has 11 min of live gameplay"
4950,that 's crazy for how much revenue it generates . now i hear ther going to be using tracking chips in the players .
4951,"well i admit there sue is a lot of action in those short , yet long 11 minutes . i think the chips will help coaches gather data to make better lays and better understand football , especially since the are putting chips in the very footballs themselves ."
4952,i understand teh footbal . but what 's the deal with the need to put them in shoulder pads .
4953,"snl why can see how players tend to move around the field , if there is gaps in the formation or how they can improve i gues s ."
4954,well ok ! something about tracing hips makes a little nerdy . di you knows hat the circular huddle was created for a deaf quaterback ?
4955,"i only recently found out myself . however , whats stunned me the most was the the cheerleader o the new orlean saints are forbidden from eating in the same restaurants as any nfl players . i wonder why ?"
4956,i assume that ' ; s to deter them from fraternizing ? ca n't do that if you forced to leave the restaurant .
4957,ya night i wonder if there was an incident for them to be the extreme about it . you do n't see other teams having such rules
4958,"probably was and they need it in the buds before the public got a hold to it . seems being an engineer is pretty lucrative , even more so than an nfl or mlb player over there lifetime ."
4959,but i think you have to consider that most players probably work for the less years than engineers .
4960,"yeah true that , still an honest profession . i wonder how much more they have to work to b reconsider having made more money ?"
4961,"hmmm a great question . in any case , give your interest in football , what position do you like ? personally , i am most interested in the quarterbacks"
4962,"apparently kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl , that 's strange ."
4963,quite a coincidence . i wonder if being left handed as a quarterback kids advantageous or disadvantages . this would really matter given that quarterbacks are the core of the team 's offense .
4964,"yeah your right . i just remember as a kid hatin hat the ball spun the wrong wat , haha ! iowa 's coach had the visitors locker room painted pink ."
4965,"in any case , this was a pleasant covnersationa bout football . i hope you bet to see some of sb this sunday and thank you or the chat ."
4966,"are you familiar with the nfl ? its hte most professional level , of american football ."
4967,a little bit . the nfl allows women to play .
4968,here i no rule that prevent female players to join the nfl .
4969,i wonder if women will join .
4970,i do n't know . i would not courage women to join the nfl . the sports are very rough and physical .
4971,a lot of players ge concussions .
4972,it ' true . their quarterbacks are pai da lot . they must be good players nad leaders .
4973,"yes , but engineers tend to make more ."
4974,i do not think so . the new qb for 49ers is paid 123 million dollars for a fiveyear contract .
4975,not all players make that much . alex smith was a junior when he entered college .
4976,he is a very smart guy . he got his bachelor degree and two years .
4977,"yeah , some junior college suffer programs like that for free . high school students ."
4978,alex smith took many ap classes at high school l .
4979,he was smart . a deaf quarterback invented the huddle .
4980,i heard about it . eh did note ant th mother team to read his hand signals .
4981,i wonder if they could . sign language is hard to learn .
4982,"if i were a professional was and there was a need o understand sign language , i would probably hire a translator ."
4983,"never thought of that . even now , translators make a lot of money ."
4984,true . do you know that baker mayfield from university of oklahoma considered quitting football ?
4985,i do n't blame him . it 's a dangerous sport .
4986,he wanted to pursue competitive gaming instead . he was very good at playing halo 3 .
4987,you can get paid to do that ?
4988,i really do not know how mayfield planned to make more money by quitting football .
4989,interesting . it was nice talking to you . good night .
4990,hey there what do you think about the dallas cowboys . do you think they have a chance this year ?
4991,"hello there , i was going they would have made it further this must season , we 'll see though . are you a cowboys can ?"
4992,yeah il ike the cowboys a little bit . teh quarterback cam newton is a good guy . i do think the redskins are a formidable team though .
4993,"yeah he is , and he redskins hve been up and down teh last decade or so ."
4994,well wo 's your favorite quarterback ? i know tha ti really like tom brady personally
4995,"tom brady will go down as one of te best , if not the best . i was always a big brett fav fan ."
4996,"oh i agree with you ! i think a lot of quarterbacks are actually really talented , like alex smith , he passed out of a lot of classes in college because eh did so well on the aps"
4997,yeah it sounds like alex smith coul dave gone into plenty of different fields of he did n't choose footbal l .
4998,"yeah i agree , he almost got a master 's degree before he went into the kraft , what do you think about the circular huddle ? did yiu know it was invented by a deaf quarterback ?"
4999,i think that is on of the most interesting and coolest facts about pr football !
5000,"yeah i agree with you , i used to play a lot of video games in college nad apparently baker mayfield was almost a professional video game player , i did n't know that ."
5001,"i didnt now that either , i think he is really good at one game in particular as well , do you know why one ?"
5002,"yeah it was halo 3 . i was actually also good at that game haha . if only we went to the same college i could have payed him , maybe i should have been a professional videogame player lol"
5003,"that is hialrious , i used to play a lot of halo 1 and 2 back the i was in college . oohhh halo 2 and milwaukee 's best light beer . lol"
5004,"haha yes those werent he days ! i was the est at halo 1 and halo 2 , but i did play halo 3 , i actually did win some tournaments or halo 1 . what would you think if you entered a locker room and i was painted pink btw ?"
5005,"that lost have been really fun to play in the . yes i think i have heard that before , that is hilarious !"
5006,"yea if it 's at the university of iowa , they painted the opposing team 's locker room pink . i wonder if that increase or decrease their winning percentage afterwards though ? it would make me play harder"
5007,"that is a very good question , and i want to know who gave the final o for them to do that !"
5008,what other games are you good at ? are you good at bowling at all ? they used to make more than professional football players back in the 60s
5009,"bio can bow la little bit , but that just goes to show how far the nfl has come since then !"
5010,i agree ! fo you ever watch football on tv ? i like knowing that espn won and emmy for the yellow line that shows first down during games
5011,i had no idea women could be in the nfl . did you ?
5012,"i had no clue how 'll ! i am learning so much from these chat hits ! i dont keep up with football in general , do you ? do you have a favorite team ?"
5013,not really but most of my friends are into it . it seems a bit boring . 11 minutes of game plays on average seems small .
5014,"yeah . i like going to football games , the environment is really exciting . watching it on tv is really boring . my whole family loves football . im not really into it either . this is interesting thoug h : nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , balls peed and location ."
5015,wow ! that i wa unaware of . although it makes sense as technology can help figure out what the and to work on . probably why they get paid so much but apparently an engineer remakes more in a lifetime than a pro baller .
5016,"wow , that is crazy considering footbal players are pretty such putting their health and safety at risk all the time ."
5017,i know . kind of funny that its the quarterback that gets the most attention when the ther seem to put more wear and tear on their bodies .
5018,"right ! except this , its pretty impressive : superbowl winning quarterback , brad johnson , is the only quarterback in nfl history to throw a touchdown pass . . . to himself ."
5019,how is that even possible ? i just found out that the huddle was created because a deaf quarterback could have hand signals shout the other team seeing . personally i am more impressed that he is deaf .
5020,thats insane . but thats nice hat the n't . was willing to make a huddle to accomodate that player !
5021,"era , that was pretty cool of them . do you watch any college ball ?"
5022,"not at all ! i only watch the 49ers games and the superbowl . but really i know nothing about teh gram e , i just cheer when i hear ' touchdown '"
5023,"yeah , i dont either . i did wonde that nfl cheerleaders don ge paid by the nfl though im not sure how true that is ."
5024,"right , they dont even get paid fore expenses for traveling to the game , i think . they get paid from some cheerleading organization . i knew a cheerleading coach . that seems hard as a career ."
5025,"apparently blew orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden to be seen nation in the same restaurant as a player and if a player comes in a restaurant hey are eating at , the cheerleader has o leave . that seems rude to me ."
5026,"wow , what the deal with that ? i thought we were past segregation . lol"
5027,"lol ! i know , right ? i actually was at a denny once when a saints player came in with his agent after a game . did see any cheerleaders though and to be honest , was all that impressed ."
5028,"did you know , those humongous american flags at football stadium , s weigh 1 , 000 pounds and cost 50 , 000 lol make . really ? thats crazy amount of money to spend on a flag ."
5029,that is insane ! i wonder were they get them from .
5030,"probably etsy , hah . yeah im not sure . just a ridiculous fact about football lol"
5031,"i hear ya ! well , have a good night !"
5032,"hi , how are you or there ? re you feeling good ?"
5033,"hi ! yes , pretty great thank you ! just finished watching some football videos . are you a fan of football ?"
5034,"i do not usually watch the football . it is violence e , and my household does not truck sixth violence on tv , only in person ."
5035,"haha ! i agree it is a very aggressive sport . which got , e wondering ; i hadnt ? t seen any female football players did you know there are currently no written rules against female players in th nfl ."
5036,"i think that violence against women would be an queer spectator sport , even in america . is there a sport with violence against the women ?"
5037,"um , no i do n't think so , but did you know an average nfl game is only 11 minutes of gameplay ?"
5038,thats scandalous . here should be some sort of law about minimal woke time or something .
5039,"yes , it makes me ponder how much times have changed . back in the 60 's top bowlers made twice eas much as top football stars ."
5040,how much money as hat exactly ? i dont think either of the groups made much . i guess the bowlers got all the women and the glory though . they were graceful athletes .
5041,"i , not sure , but yes there seem to be a lot of irregularities within the sport for instance new orleans saints cheerleaders are not allowed to be in the same restaurants as nfl of the players ."
5042,"i think thats a sexist form of misogyny ours something along those lines . the more should be chivalry , hous and have the women ."
5043,"to each their own i suppose , speaking of lines , that super imposed yellow line youse us in the game , espn ha so an emmy for that . did know taht was possible ."
5044,i think espn should try to put a line where th cheerleaders are so that they dont have problems with players . that would be vhivaleou sofa espn . what does espn stand for ?
5045,"i think people should just shave some common sense but i do n't see that happening daytime soon . then l uses tracking devices to track players on teh field , im sure that a way to keep tabs on players"
5046,i think they could track team off age field too . too many of them guys get to all kinds of criminal mischief . they need some help .
5047,"in that case the whole world would be tracked , i think he an think of better rays than to ' control '"
5048,"nfl players are role models for many young people . i am not . i can not speak for you . i figure tha tgif they do n't ge into trouble , tey dont need tracking . but some of them , . . i dunno ."
5049,"thats a whole other subject w dont have enough time here for . but this would be a whole different palace i more love was implemented the current system has people going crazy and violence is out of had , we just look within oneself ."
5050,i suppose that we are running out of time . the nfl should invent a chip to help up look within ourselves not just track each other . what ties inside ? chips might just help us there .
5051,"id disagree e , we have everything we nee duo look within ourself . . . you woudl just tube giving your power away by allowing to get clipped . someone else in control of you and your decision . this planted would no longer be free will . the nfl should just stick to tracking balls to track speed and rotation"
5052,"i feel lost sometimes andre am willing to try the chips . i trust the science of the soul . anyway , thanks for the heart tp heart chat . peace ."
5053,"meditate , i feel that same way ! but halves found answers looking within , you need nothing else , change your vibration and your outlook in life and life will reciprocate . itll be challenging but its worth it . then a only then to will be free . nice chatting witht you too ! namaste . in love and light ."
5054,"i love football , but not a big fan of th panthers . how about you ? are you a fan of the nfl ?"
5055,i dont know th game very well . you dont like the panthers ? why not ?
5056,"well , im not just not a fan of the quarterback cam 's attitude . although the offense is on point lately ."
5057,i guess teh quarterback is the most prominent person on the team . hes ets te tone of a lot of things .
5058,"what it amounts to is he really only had a couple of exceptional season . he convinced everyone he is superman , t hat is his nickname ."
5059,so he is past his peak . didnt his team play in the superbowl recently ? i think it remember they lost .
5060,they based everything in a guy who cant hold his temper . he acts out when he cant throw and blames otters .
5061,so much of the game success depends on personality and integrity . cant teach tha . either you got i or you dont .
5062,"yep , i agree with you . some people like cam are nokie ready for the long career . turner began to take th pressure off am by screaming more throws tot e running backs ."
5063,"you cotta work with the players you have , not hte ones you want . the nfl is an interesting study in personality . i wonder how women would fare in the nfl ."
5064,"yeah , good question . ha now the nfl does nice have a rule against women playing ."
5065,"iv heard as much . i figure if a woman could do the job , theyd tire he do i just dont think it will happen ."
5066,i think anything is possible but no women have met the leagues eligibility requirements yet . the size of the me note so big i would have to be a really amazon type of women .
5067,"yes , maybe genetic engineering will help us out there . it will be like starship troopers . that would be fun ."
5068,"oh yeah , ha cool . ya know the new orleans saints cheelreaesrs can not be at that same restaurant with the football players . if they are in the same palace the cheerleaders have to leave immediately . wow"
5069,"stat rule must come from somewhere , but i cant figure out where . was there a problem with romantic relationships ? strange outdated rule ."
5070,"oh yeah , thats ' a good point . maybe it has something to do with that . i know that games go by foot it for me , thing a big fan , i want to see mrs play time ."
5071,"yeah , i hear you . 11 minutes sounds like a rip off . i figure that teh union got involved ! lol"
5072,"haha , i want the whole two and a hal hours of play time . lax smith is such a good qb that e might extend the games with how smart he is . he was and to get his bachelors in two years . it usually takes four year ."
5073,"yeah , he really was bright and focused . more students should do that and get through faster . anyway , great chat !"
5074,"i know and i agree with the fact taht the players need to focus on education and football . baker mayfield almost too kit too far by focusing on gaming and was n't gon na go for football but rather try to be a professional gamer , ages . lol . have a good one ."
5075,i have an article about football . you ?
5076,i 'm s fan of fooball . i coul ads with less commercials though . they have like 11 minutes of live gameplay in thas leage broadcast .
5077,is n't that crazy ? th junpero terra high school jv football team recorded a historically bad season in which they failed to win a game or eve score a touchdown yet they never attempted to start their backup quarterback .
5078,yeah he was tom brady . weird .
5079,"is 's crazy ! also smith took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a junior . the quarterback received his bachelor 's degree in two years , and began working on a master 's degree , before becoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft ."
5080,smart guy . speaking of collie the university f iowa ha sa pink locker do . i think you 'd always remember that one .
5081,"yes , you would know what to expect ! the circular huddle used in todays american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not read his han signals ."
5082,innovative . the nfl tracks everything witht chips embedded in the players pads .
5083,"they like to get alot of info ! the quarterbacks is usually considered the leader of the offensive team , and is often responsible for calling the play i nthe huddle ."
5084,did you know there 's only one lefthanded quarterback in the nfl l ?
5085,"no ! the quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive pay , and is the offensive player that almost always throws forward passes ."
5086,"that 's a lot of responsibility . baker mayfield , qb and oklahoma , almost quit football to be a professional video gamer . i wonder if he played madden at all ?"
5087,"no idea ! sports commonly called football in certain places include association football , known s soccer in some countries , ; gridiron football , specifically american football or canadian football , ; australian rules football ; rugby football , either rugby league or rugby union , ; and gaelic football"
5088,intresting . there are a lot of definitions . i 'm assuming they all kick a ball at some point .
5089,me too ! former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
5090,nice had ! i wonder if risky hands is hey new orlean cheerleaders and thee fooball team ca n't eat at the same restaurant .
5091,"thats a good question ! p ; ,"
5092,sometimes wish i could get more games than the 16 games in the nfl season .
5093,"i thin alot of people fee , that way . espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games ."
5094,very coo if i wonder if any women will ever p ; ay in the nfl . there 's nothing in the rules that says they ca n't .
5095,that would be fun o see ! different variations of footbal like known as football codes .
5096,yeah it would . it think there 's more money as an engineer though over your lifetime .
5097,what nfl team does colt mccoy currently play for ?
5098,mccoy plays for washington . he ahs been in washington for years .
5099,how much did he sign for in his 30s recent extension ?
5100,he cold get up to 7 million dollars . not bad for being a backup .
5101,"not at all ! there was some sort og playing clause in it , wasnt ' there ?"
5102,i sure there are some playing incentives to get to the full 7 million .
5103,i thouhg here was something about mccoy possibly becoming a free agent .
5104,"he has stuck with the redskins through iii nad kirk cousins , and is now behind alex smith . he seems happy there ."
5105,"i suppose so , particle , only after being drafted y dcleveladn ? do you remember which year that happened ?"
5106,2010 amaze . my is one of about z billion qbs ' drafted by the browns .
5107,that 's pretty funny ! he went somewhere else before coming to washington . do you know there ?
5108,he also spent some time in sf . buy he is happy ow with the redskins and coach jay gruden .
5109,"i can se the , although he wants to be a starter . his 2014 run was n't great though . know any of his stats from that year ?"
5110,mccoy was 13 . a starter in 2014 . ther eis a reason he is a backup .
5111,"true , although hyou never know . have you heard about the junipero serra high school jv backup qb ?"
5112,"yes , ot 's the high school that refused o start tom brady , even though they failed to score a touchdown the entire season ."
5113,pretty amazing ! how many teams are in the national football league anyway ?
5114,"there are 32 teams , divided evenly into the national footbal conference e , nfc , and the american football conference , afc , ."
5115,"after a 17week season , the playoffs end this meek before tshirt i game . what is it called again ?"
5116,"some call it the super bowl wb ut if your a commercial business adn have n't signed a licensing agreement with the nfl , you have to call it ' ; the big time ' . ha !"
5117,"neat 's pretty funny ! a lot way from the 1960 's , when bowlers made twice as much ass football stars ! thanks fo all this great infomratikn !"
5118,hello !
5119,"hi , do are you ?"
5120,"doing well , and yourself ?"
5121,"very well , thanks . do you enjoy football ?"
5122,i do ! did you watch the super bowl last night ?
5123,i did ! although i did all asleep during the 4th quarter and woke up when trophy was being handed out . . . did you wathc ?
5124,lol ! ca n't say i blame you it was n't an overly exciting game
5125,it was n't . . . th glass of whiskey might have helped my sleep . . . did you watch it ?
5126,i did i was n't even a huge fan of the commercials which is normal my favorite part
5127,i thought they were just ok too . who were you rooting for ?
5128,anyone but the patriots lol so rams last night . really i am more of am n person
5129,"uh oh . . . i am from chicago so we have an nfc north friction . just kidding , we are united by our hatred of green bay !"
5130,"haha , yes ! mutual hatred always makes for entertainment ! did yo hav any favorite commericals ?"
5131,i liked the nfl 100 . i'ts ' the only one tha really stood out to me . plus my kids were watching next to me and tanked thee nice time . . .
5132,ah yeah that would definitely make it tough . have you paid any attention to some of the nfl rule changes over thee last couple of years ?
5133,yeah . what do you have in mind . . .
5134,what aired your thoughts on the menu helmet rule when making contact ?
5135,my head understands it but my heart wants to see bone crushing this . at the same time seeing the older nfl players struggle in daily life list hugh . . .
5136,"yeah , i agree . it 's kin to like going to a hockey game and they can only slap ethic other lol . similar thoughts on the touching the passer changes ?"
5137,the qbs are protected pretty well so i would liek to see some rules to help the def . . .
5138,that 's an interesting thought i 've never thought about it from the other side . do you have nothing specific in mind ?
5139,"it really but there are times when the def is lagged for a simple hit that shouldnt ot eb lagged . any way , thank you so much for the chat . i relaly enjoyed thai love . i hope we get paired in the future . . ."
5140,do you like football ?
5141,i do like football ! do you ?
5142,"i do , in what conference is your favorite team ?"
5143,"nfc north , that bears . ours ?"
5144,"afc east , m patriots , he you watching teh superbowl this year ?"
5145,"nic . . . yeah , i will be watching it . i guess i do not have to ask who you are rooting fo r ?"
5146,"patriots for sure lo , tomb ad the bears didnt make it , im counting the days for sunday ."
5147,what are you doing for the game
5148,gathering with friend what about you ? doing anything special ?
5149,"no , i love to cook game day food so i will cook some wings and mumbo or jambalaya and eat that . i do not like watching with people because they ask me too many questions . i like to use the commercial breaks to relax , get food org o potty and everyone wants to watch those instead and i guess yelled at to sit down so i stopped being social for that game ."
5150,"yeh i get you , it can be stressful specially if your gathering a your home , you know the saints cheerleaders have to leave if a player arrives to a restaurant ."
5151,seems sexist ! are you staying at your place or going somewhere else ?
5152,"staying at my place , but its only a few of us see i dont think it would be stressful ."
5153,that 's nice . my wife loves to have people over for the game but hates the games . seems weird to me but the just into lavigne fun .
5154,"thats funny lol , i bet she doesnt know about the tracking chips players have in their shoulder pads , stat a cool fact i will share sunday for sure ."
5155,seth dogs n't know about those chips but she knows bout doritos and doritos ! ! ! so good . . .
5156,"i guess they a better thing to know lol , you know the average gameplay is of only 11 minutes ! !"
5157,tha 's a short time . kellan moore is the only left handed day in the nfl .
5158,really ? i would have thought there were t least a couple more !
5159,"yeah , me too . do you , ike baker mayfield ?"
5160,"i do like him , i think he is a great player ."
5161,me too ! nice chatting with you and good luck this weekend !
5162,did you know that there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl .
5163,"wow , only he impressive , i am left handed and i would be a minority in the nfl"
5164,"yes indeed , lol . do you know who baker mayfield is ?"
5165,i have . i think he is the b from the university of oklahoma
5166,indeed he thought at one time to leave football door competitive gaming . apparently he had a favorite game . do you know it ?
5167,he at pretty good in halo 3 . . . by the way do you know how the circular huddle was created ?
5168,i though it was so the other player could n't see what the new as saying .
5169,"it was created by a deaf qb paul , d hubbard ! !"
5170,o you that makes sense as well . you know theres no written rule that prevents women from playing in the nfl ?
5171,"wow , i wonder if any women had tried ! ! they could earn more money by boeing engineers !"
5172,"yeah over tha long call , i would rather redo 101 years on the field and leave with my millions tan 40 plus . what about you ?"
5173,exactly i would do the same as you ! hey did you know what they did in the university of iowa visitors locker room ?
5174,too funny somebody told me that the looker room is painted pink . that would just make me mad .
5175,"that is funny intimidation , more like a joke !"
5176,right i think they thought they were goin goto intermediatet he other team . you know the average game only has 11 minutes of life game play ?
5177,"wow , sounds do short . . but the whole show with the stops is very enjoyable to me and now is more interesting with data that is tracked by chips"
5178,yeah and in tracking chips are in hte shoulder pads as we . soon will be watching a . i . 's playing .
5179,looks like we are going in that direction ! did you know bowlers barney more than football player sin the 60 's ? '
5180,yeah o was told twice as much that ? s crazy ! how about the rule about new orleans cheerleader . have you heard about this sexist thing ;
5181,ot is terrible ! ! they can not eat where any nfl players dat ! !
5182,right and if there already eating and a player comes in then they go to get a dog bag .
5183,awful ! ! so unfair . tha should not be hwappenign !
5184,do you know who played the highest scoring college game in histoy ?
5185,thagt wa more than 100 years ago ! it was georgia tech an cumberland
5186,yup 2200 that hurts . coud have hated to be on the bus ride home .
5187,that is so sa for cumberland d ! ! well it has been a nice chat !
5188,it was have good day !
5189,"who do you like better , the fans r redskins ?"
5190,"i am not relaly a football fan , how about you ?"
5191,"i liken football , but i 'm not as big of a fan as i used to be . . . i play fantasy football a lot though , so i follow the league pretty closely ."
5192,interesting . i heard in the season that the redskins won three and a row after a terrier loss to the saints
5193,"yeah , the redskins are a good team . they have a running back named adrian peterson who is very good . at one tiem he was the best player in the league , but is now old and close to retirement ."
5194,hs is the nfl 's leading usher an nwas n't end in the team 's plans subtle late august . he 's a big par of the offense .
5195,"yes he is ; d o you feel washington 's offense i stood enough to keep up with matt ryan , julia jones , and the rest of atlanta 's high powered offense ?"
5196,i have no idea but redskins secondary has struggled against the pass . i ? e heard that but not sure that that means . can you enlighten me ?
5197,"sure , blatant his one of the best quarterbacks in the league , matt ryan . he is very good at passing the all . unfortunately , washington has a very poor defense and are not the to defend against teams that pass the ball well . the ' secondary ' are the defensive played responsible for demeaning the pass ."
5198,"wow , thank you for the explaination . apparently washington recently made a trade to boost its defensive backfired , to get safety shaw ha clintons ."
5199,"yes , he came over to washington from green bay . since washington 's defense was so poor , they decided to trade for clintondix , who os very good at defend9ign against a passing offense . unfortunately , quinn dunham is injured with a nerve shoe in his lower leg . i 'm not sure if clintondix will be enough to stop atlanta ."
5200,"yeah , i heard he is a physical defender who can fly to the bal land kind of limit atlanta 's receivers ' comfort ."
5201,"seven though atlanta will be passing the ball a lot , i suspect washington wall pdiamr8ily run hte ball . atlanta has bee struggling the season and washington is very good at running the footbal l ."
5202,"if the redskins let ryan stand in their pocket , it might be a challenge for them ."
5203,do you understand what it means to ' stand in she pocket ? '
5204,i have a slight idea but perhaps you can enlighten me again !
5205,"when a 1uarterbakc has the law and wanting to pass it to a receiver , he has five teammates on the offensive line the is protecting him from being tackled . the barrier these five offensive lineman create is called ' teh pocket . ' if they do their job , the quarterback can stay inside of the pocket and deliver a good law . if not , he will have to try to run and get away ."
5206,you are awesome at explaining things . make if you were around on game days i could actually understand football ! i only wathc during te super bowl . i guess i will wait to watch my next game the first sunday of next february .
5207,"football can be somewhat intimidating o try and understand , but the rules are fairly nessy . knowing that there ar zeno rules against women paying in the nfl , do you ever think a woman will play ?"
5208,i actually read about a woman like who is playing on the men 's college football tom . maybe shed is our next hope .
5209,it woudl eb fun to see a woman in the nfl . the kicker is a good position for the first woman to play . they rarely get tackled and have rules protecting how hard the can get hit . i still feel neat a very strong woman could play another position and tackle just as well as the men could .
5210,"i hope so . the nfl seems a bt sexist though . i know football players are more important but still , when new orleans saints cheerleaders are already eating in a restaurant , they the to leave if saints players com into the restaurant ."
5211,hello are you a football fan ?
5212,hi how are you ? sometimes i follow football . you ?
5213,i do a little bit . did you know the highest score in a football game was 2220 nothing . thats a lot of points .
5214,what happened there ? the winning coach sould be ashamed . what is the point of that rubbing ?
5215,that is crazy . you never know though . he may have put his thier string in phd the were still just way better .
5216,"yeah , that 's true . i wonder why cumberland scheduled that game . no point ."
5217,i bet they didnt schedule it again for awhile . lol . in the 1960s top bowlers mad more than football stars . that i really had to believe .
5218,hte nfl was just starting opt we i guess the fan base was not bi enough . plus the players proabably didt hav epa union
5219,"i ut cant see bowling being something people would really watch . it is fun to play , but i dont know about watching ."
5220,"i guess the fans followed the sport because theuy played as will . probably a lot of local leagues , and that raised interest in pros ."
5221,hey espn one a emmy for the yellow line that shows where first down is .
5222,that is amazing ! an award for a line ? must have been a soft year for awards . lol
5223,it nwas a really good idea . it will probably ; y still b being used wen every actor alive today is dead .
5224,"yes , it is a standard part o the broadcast . i cant imagine the game without the superimposed graphics ."
5225,it sure i . so what do you thin about the university of iowa painting their listing locker zoom pink ?
5226,"i figure that it has some effect , but is it enough to matters ? if so , the every team would do it ."
5227,so no rule about women n football . do you think it will ever have n ?
5228,i wonder . maybe at the positions that would be ok ? like kicker or punter ?
5229,"maybe . there is only about 1 minute sofa actual gameplay . kicker is , what ? 1 percent i that ?"
5230,"yeah , not much contact for the kicker . probably pretty safe at the high school level too . anyway , great chat !"
5231,you to . have a grea tray .
5232,good morning to you !
5233,hi . do you like sports ? do you likd football ?
5234,"i enjoy some football , are we talking about american football or european football ?"
5235,american footbal . especially the nfl national football league . do you have a favorite team ? the 32 ?
5236,"i do , i root for the pats . how about you ?"
5237,i do n't know much about football . i do know about the patriots . i learned that the quarterback with the most wins was neon roethlisberger for the pittsburgh steelers .
5238,"hes pretty good , hes one a team staples for asl dont as i can remember . hes a great qb"
5239,i learned that kellan moore is the only left handed quarrtetbck in the nfl . i thought there woul be more .
5240,i wonder why that is . do you think it has to do with how they have to turn their body to throw ?
5241,that is a great point . i did not think of it that way . there is a quarterback who threw at touchdown pass to himself !
5242,imagined how cools hat would look ? i bet he felt so bad ass when hs did that
5243,and dud you know stan there are only 2 african american quarterbacks to have wo nthe superbowl ?
5244,which is surprising to me because the nfl is pretty diverse . did you know here is nothing in the rules that says a woman cant play ?
5245,thay is that to know that anyone can play . on a rocket scientist is coaching in the nfl .
5246,i bet he some pretty feat deals and strategies for hi steam !
5247,i bet he knows a lot about the humongous american flags at the stadium that weigh 1100 pounds .
5248,is that how much that thing weighs ? good god i cant imagine seeing what it looks like all folded up !
5249,"yes and they cost 50 , 000 dollars to make ! that is one hefty flag !"
5250,9 ? ? ? ? i min the wrong business !
5251,wall thanks me much for chatting . i learned a lot about football today .
5252,"likewise , take care"
5253,do you watch the nfl ? i think it is the best form of any of the different types of football !
5254,hi ! i do watch when i can but yes i love the nfl .
5255,awesome ! i am not a huge ravens fan but i think that it would be interesting if franco was replaced by lamar jackson .
5256,i agree ! lamar jackson is a great quarterback and that would be a treat fit !
5257,year definitely would be fun to watch . i think quarterbacks get a lot of publicity because htey are essentially the offensive leader .
5258,"definitely ! lamar jackson has a really impressive record , he rushed 1 , 500 yards and and pass for over 3 , 000 yards in a season to games a few !"
5259,yeah and winnings the heisman trophy is no easy feat either ! the ravens playback should cater to jacksons strengths .
5260,"my thoughts exactly , th deadly should be proud to ahve him as a quarterback . he will b introduced into some new schemes they ave going so he will e even better ."
5261,yeah . i also enjoy football because it i sas family sport . it 's crazy that there is only 11 minutes of actual action in an nfl game .
5262,"it is a great family sport , and true so little actual live play for so many hours n a game . i like to watch the quarterbacks the most , tom brady is also fantastic ."
5263,"yeah tom brady is a champ , definitely one of the greats ! apparently the circular huddle was developed for a deaf quarterback . interesting that it stuck ."
5264,"i read about that , pretty amazing and smart ! fooball and the nfl history is full of run facts !"
5265,yeah . and ther eis only one left handed quarterbackkellan moore . must not bet hat much of a good thing otherwise there woul be mork !
5266,"i would think being left handed in footbal , ll would be very challenging . i wonder if the tracking devices are the same when placed in a left handers shoulder pads ."
5267,good question . baker mayfield almost quit football to be a competitive gamer can you believe that ? these players are so talented in many things .
5268,right ? they have option which is great . i find it interesting taht an engineer makes more money in their lifetime than an nfl player . . . . crazy !
5269,yeah that is surprising . engineers are really smart but i still would want to b and snl player . ? just more fun and exciting even if im fake less money .
5270,"true ! although being an nfl player your chances of injury are so thin and you ca n't play that hard for too many years . i also heard that pro bowler made twice they money as a football player years ago hahaa , weird !"
5271,haha bowling is definitely fun but i would never guess it would be lucrative if i wonder how much they make nowadays ?
5272,"i agree ! do they even have pro bowling anymore ? lol , how n't seen that in awhile . i will stick to watching the nfl haha"
5273,haha same . well it was nice talking with you ! have a great night !
5274,"case keanu , the next broncos quarterback . he had a great year for the vikings in 2017 ."
5275,he has a coo blame . i hope he performs up to hi snake for alway 's broncos !
5276,"nice 's been mediocre his whole career , then hd a career season with minnesota ."
5277,makes you wonder why the vikings passed on making him their franchise player .
5278,i think they believe 201 nwas a fluke . minnesota has its eyes o kirk cousins .
5279,"so keanu moves on with free agency , just like his fellow viking , radford and bridgewatertwo other cool names ."
5280,"denver was loaded with mediocre qb 's in 2017 , too . siberian , lynch , osweiler ."
5281,"yeah , and they traded up in the 201 draft to grey lynch , and that did not work out for them ."
5282,"looks like denver wond at a qb for 2018 with keanu in hand . that will be good for the bills , who are trading up ."
5283,"ah , the bills . searching for that fifth super growl loss . just like alway sad about denver , buffalo needs to get better rat thati spot too , qb that is , ."
5284,you need a good quarterback to do well . look at how denver has fared sine peyton manning retired .
5285,true . brings a tear to my eye remembering alway nd manning in the orange jersey . .
5286,"gm alway stinks the broncos are close , and keanu could put them in super bowl contention ."
5287,yeh . i guess the nfl will be putting a chip in keenums shoulder pads in denver soon to monitor his position on the field . hopefully he will stay in denver long enough l make it on hte field .
5288,or maybe denver will use keanu to good a new young quarterback .
5289,"that could happen . teh orange could use matt patrica as coach , the only rocket scientist in the nfl ."
5290,"yes , the nfl takes all kinds . there are no rules against women playing ."
5291,"yeah . if patricia writes the play s , he takes inspiration from his old rpi firt son g , where they mention such footballsavvy term as sine , cosine , and magnet ."
5292,maybe patricia should have stuck with rocket science . engineers earn more lifetime thant he average info player l
5293,"yeah , and if you have a bad record , it lives in statistical ingame forever . liek the poor cleveland browns . the qb with ther most wins in their stadium is not even from their own team , but from their rivals , the steelers ' roethlisberger ."
5294,"maybe 'the browns can get baker mayfield a he is excellent at competitive gaming , and might make their game competitive ."
5295,"hi there , do you watch the nfl ?"
5296,"yup . i do n't know why , but i do enjoy his game . 32 teams does n't seem like enough ."
5297,yeah i know . did you know women scan play if they qualify ?
5298,"yeah . which conference do you think will one the first to have a woman , afc or nfc"
5299,"i wonder about taht , to will have to wait and the i guess . do you know the re only 11 minutes of game play ?"
5300,"17 grueling weeks , wild card weekend , the players , and then the superbowl , and all of the only 11 minutes each . does't sound super . . ."
5301,i know . did you hear about that rule with new orleans cheerleaders ?
5302,"yeah , what ; s the deal with that ; does n't sound fair . but neither does having to wear tracking chips to monitor your every o e ! nfl even puts those ship in the balls to measure speed , rotation , etc . sounds a bit overkill for 11 minutes . . ."
5303,"yeah wen you think of it that way . ans that rule is so sexist , i wonder how the still get away with it"
5304,"the league is not made up o rocket scientists . . . well , except for matt patricia . . ."
5305,yeah talk about a career change . do you know that the highest score in football is ?
5306,"are we talking about cheerleaders again ? the high school stadium in allen , tx seats 18 , 000 and costs about 60 million wh ow i taht for as core ?"
5307,"wow that is a lot of money . the highest score was actually 2220 , what a win and a loss at the same time"
5308,i wish i had a recording of that game ! you know those huge flags that display in stadiums can weigh as much as 1100 lbs ? it probably takes the whole team to put them away each night . . .
5309,"wow that is super heavy . u of iowa visitor , locker room is actually painted pink i wonder why ?"
5310,to hide the pigskin ? lol you know snoop dog wrote a fight song fir his son 's high school football team ? that will let he crowd rocking !
5311,that s for sure . did you know espn o nanu emmy once ?
5312,"waht fo r ? let me guess , they were acting like he knew what they were talking about ? brad johnson serves an emmy . . . he is the only superbowl winning qb to have thrown a pass to himself !"
5313,i would have liked to see that actually . they won it for the yellow superimposed line
5314,"ok . i accept that . just like brad accepted his own pass , a nd then scored a touchdown ! see me doing my end zone dance ?"
5315,haha yeah he must have made headxpinesw i that . it was nice chatting wit hyou
5316,"hi , how are you doing ?"
5317,great . are you a football fan ?
5318,why yes i am . how about you ?
5319,did you know that alex smith of so many ap classes that he entered college ss a junior ? ; smart quarterback !
5320,"no , id id n't know that , but it 's probably a good thing eh went to college . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player ."
5321,omg ! and the injuries ! tom brady is an amazing qb but in high school he was the back up that didnt get to play . i am sure that coach is sorry now !
5322,"yeah , i bet that coach has taken alot of robbing over the years about not playing the goat ."
5323,what dies was mean ?
5324,"greatest of la lime , tom brady . 4 time sperbolw champion lol"
5325,"oohhh . speaking of qbs , did you know that there is only one left handed one ? kellan moore ."
5326,"yeah , i would have thought there was more than one , but hey that must give him some kin doof advantage , i 'm sure ."
5327,i also did not knows hat the huddle came from a deaf qb that didnt want hte other team to read his sign language . interesting ?
5328,"yeah , that is interesting . but do you know there is a planet tthat has never fumbled the ball in hi entire nfl career ?"
5329,i cant imagine ho it is ? is he playing now ?
5330,"no , former patriots who benjarvus greenellis . mist have been very hard to accomplish that ."
5331,"what an accord , plishmen tc dud you know the highest score in football was georgia tech in 1916 ? they scored 222 points ."
5332,"whoo , that 's alot points . i do n't think that would happen nowadays . i watched the superbowl and it was the lowest scoring superbowl ga , e ever ."
5333,boring ! and a half hours and the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of gameplay . who knew ?
5334,"i know , but ye wwe watch anyway . lol"
5335,no wonder the announcers talk so much ! and there is no rule against women playing in the nfl . they just have to meet eligibility requirements .
5336,"that would be cool . well it 's been nic chatting , i need to go walk my dog , talk to you later , friend ."
5337,i think the qb i 'the most important player on the filed .
5338,most definitely ! how are you today ?
5339,i am great what about you ? do you lime football ?
5340,i do like football . im a steelers fan . what about you ?
5341,i do like it and was trivia do you know what the highest score ever ?
5342,222 to 0 back in 1916 ! the losing team must have been asleep !
5343,"sleep or all blind , who loses by that much , an average nfl game only hs 11 minutes of gameplay ,"
5344,apparently cumberland ! hopefully they got better since then .
5345,"i sure hope so , did you know where is no written rule in the nfl against woman playing in the league !"
5346,that is funny . do you think a woman will ever play in then fl ? i think maybe a kicker if anything .
5347,"i dont think they will , men are stronger its as a thing of nature besides they can always get tackled as kickers"
5348,true that . crazy that rb benjarvus green ellis never fumbled once !
5349,"i heard he wa s agreat player , never watched him play high , what teams in he play for ?"
5350,he formerly player for the patriots .
5351,"i see , well it makes sense he band a great team , i wonder how much money he made , i hear engineers will make more money than football players eventually"
5352,probably because their careers are way longer than football players i assume .
5353,"that would make sense , they do have longer careers so yeah , also football players tend to have short careers"
5354,it iss surprising that only the qb in the nfl is left handed ;
5355,"only one ? wow , whats his name ?"
5356,kellan moore is the only left handed player .
5357,"oh i like how he playes , great fact , anyways its been grea chatting with you i feel a lot more knowledgable about the sport now ! thanks"
5358,nice chatting with you as well !
5359,"hello there , are you a fan of the nfl . ?"
5360,"yeah , i really try to watch during the playoffs . how out you ?"
5361,yeah i follow my team during the regular season and then watch most of the playoff games .
5362,in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . i wonder what athletes were in better shape ? nobody watches bowling the same as they did then .
5363,"yeah inst that wild , shows ow much the sport has grow rand bowling , well it 's bowling . i guess the thing to be was a bowler in the 60 's though ."
5364,the nfl has nor yule against female players . do you think e 'll ever see women in the game ?
5365,"i think we will , and i think that it would be really cool if that did happen ."
5366,i could see them playing positions like punter or kicker or place holder . i think those are the positions that would be most expected .
5367,"yeah i think those woul one the first editions that we would see a female player . but , if one aide it as a regular field player , that would eb awesome ."
5368,"shred have o be big , o fast , or both . an average nfl game has a mere 11 minutes of live gameplay . that 's far less that i expected ."
5369,"yeah that seems so low , i know that you notice it a lot more when you go to live mars . on tv , you do n't really notice the breaks and all the stoppage so much ."
5370,it would be great to se the first down line project onto the actual wild . espn won an emmy for the creation o 'the superimposed yellow line . coudl e get it at the stadium live ?
5371,yeah i wonder when they will try and do that for the fans that attend live .
5372,"we need a clever engineer to come up wit that system . an engineer 's average lifetime earnings are higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player . parents , do n't let your kids grow up to be athletes 2"
5373,"yeah i think that nation of the career is so much shorter for pro athletes , and they just need to know how to invest their earnings correctly !"
5374,true . they could use better financial advice . maybe they could become video lame players ike baker mayfield . there are professional video game players .
5375,yeah i do know if i could beat him at halo 3 but maybe halo 2 i could !
5376,why are cheerleaders prohibited from eating at the same restaurant as players s ? that seems strange to me .
5377,that seems strange and really outdated to me . i think they need t think that over .
5378,"yeah , maybe they had a problem with romantic relationships between the two groups . anyway , i enjoyed chatting with you !"
5379,"yeah same here , i hope you have a food night ."
5380,are you s fan o fooball ? i enjoy pro bu that college so much .
5381,"me too , i like college football , but i do n't like the idea of it . especially how they treat the players"
5382,"i also disagree with the treatment of their players . speaking of college , did you know that the university of iowa did to the visiting locker room ?"
5383,"i didnt a , what did they do ?"
5384,they painted it completely pink !
5385,what ! no way . do you think it was to psych out their opponents ?
5386,i would assume . so strange . have you also ever heard what hte highest footballs score ever was ?
5387,"i did , it was an embarrassment , 2220 . wow . no mercy rule in football i guess , huh"
5388,i ca n't imagine that . how is it even possible to score tha many points in one game ? !
5389,idk haha meanwhile we have the superbowl score not even reaching a combined 3 pounts ! the tema with to must have just rolled over at one point
5390,seems to be the case . did you know that espn created the yellow line that shows the first down ? can you imagine watching a game on tv without that line ?
5391,it is absolutely necessary to use . i used to think that line was on the field in real life too nad they bust moved it a lot . then i went to a game and it n't see it
5392,"ha ha , that 's hilarious . have you ever heard of the , benjarvus greenellis ?"
5393,the gamer rings a bell but i 'm not sure what he did
5394,he played for the patriots . in his entire time with the patriots he never fumbled a ball !
5395,"wow , w hat a guy . he must ave been a star . did you hear about baker mayfield ?"
5396,i did not . what about him ?
5397,apparently early on in his career he considered quitting footbal alto pursue a professional halo 3 career . you do n't hear that every day !
5398,oh wow . i suppose if he is still good that he can do it s a seconds career later .
5399,"that 's a big maybe , i dont think the halo 3 scene is as popular anymore . i think he made the right choice for sure"
5400,who knows when it comes to competitive gaming . people still compete with starcraft nad that game is old .
5401,hey ! guess how the circular huddle used in football came to be !
5402,i never knew that ish ow it happened debut that it 's really neat that it is because of a deaf quarterback so the other players could not see his hand signals
5403,yes ! i wonder how its benefited te game outside of that . i o n't actually follow football much . i 've just been reading about it litle .
5404,i love football but theresa re a let of things i did not know like tenure is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl his name is kellan moore
5405,"yes ! it 's surprising that there 's only one , in the numbers . i wonde why ."
5406,not sure but that scool . i also just learned that the former patriots running back has never fumbled a football in his nfl career
5407,yes ! benjarvus greenellis ! bu to much time did he spend playing ? i wonder if he was really good is if he just did n't play much .
5408,lol i didnt think about that
5409,"yeah , with all 11 minute sofa actual play per game , and it all o 'the players on the field at once , you could get through a season without being on the field or long ."
5410,true true ! did you know there were tracking devices in uniforms and in the actual football itself
5411,"yes , the nfl uses shoulder pads with embedded chips ."
5412,that 's crazy i never would have guessed that and that the new koreans saints cheerleaders are not allowed to dine with the nfl players and if they are eating already the cheerleaders have to stop eating and leave . i wonder why
5413,"yeah , requiring them to leave sounds dubious . does the nfl compensate them for the meal they miss ? why not just have some kind of communication to prevent that from happening ? im can since they have that rule to begin with ."
5414,"i agree , you 're exactly right , you 'd think they would have thought of tha instead doof drama happening if they do show up at the same spot"
5415,"yeah . today , they could just hav lean app where players and cheerleaders check into a restaurant . they could't have to communicate with each other , which is probably the point . it would be interesting to interview players and cheerleaders about what they think of that rule ."
5416,yeah it would be the smart thing to do and there are apps for taking your dog out for a walk so you think they woudl have one for that
5417,"yeah . they could use an existing app , ike google amps , for example . i can see potential issues with teh having to leave doing , like if someone was n't compensated fo nra meal they did't get to eat or if there was some kind of health issue involved ? it just seems like something that would lead to problems ."
5418,absolutely i ponder why they do that like if thet team hid some type o problems with the cheerleaders stalking or something
5419,"yeah . i guess the point is so that the players now cheerleaders do n't get too friendly with each other so hte cheerleaders are n't a distraction from the players ' significant others , so everyone stays professions during the game , to avoid harassment of the cheerleaders or vice overs a , stuff like that ."
5420,you think that would be or all the teams not just one team out of how many
5421,yeah . and people should be treated to behave responsive once they have so ha prestigious jkf .
5422,they should be trusted to act prestigious regardless of there job but people are human and we all mess up some more then others unfortuantely
5423,"yes wb ut with a job where you 're in the public eye and there ' fierce competition to get there , people should be expected to hold themselves to certain standards and if they do something out of line like harnessing a cheerleader just let them go and let someone else take their place ."
5424,yes you 're right about that
5425,"well , this has been a good conversation . hasve a great evening wherever you are !"
5426,"hi , how are you ?"
5427,hi . good how are you . do you watch nfl ? ;
5428,i do watch the nfl . do you ?
5429,yes i too . did you know women can play too ?
5430,"wow , weird . do you think they should play ?"
5431,"yes , why not . if thy can make the cut they should play"
5432,i agree . j am not sure i could watch it though . those players are huge .
5433,true . did you hear about that cheerleader rule in new orleans ?
5434,i did not . what is i ?
5435,they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players
5436,that ' sexist . what if they are there first ? the nfl has only 11 minutes of action .
5437,"i find that sexist too . and i they are eating and the player walks in , they have to leave . weird ."
5438,"if i were them , i would dump my map on the floor handm fake a scene . . ."
5439,yeah i guess they like to live to those rules . did you know nfl players make less than engineers ?
5440,i did not . that make sense though since most nfl players only blast 23 yeas .
5441,yeah i guess . did you know espn won an emmy ?
5442,"no , for what ?"
5443,the creation of the superimposed yellow line
5444,wow . . . is that emmy worthy ' i feel like that 's a low bar to get an emmy . . .
5445,i do n't get it either ? do you know benjarvus greenellis ?
5446,"yes , football player who never fumbled . nice chatting with you !"
5447,good evening ! are you ready for the super bowl in aw eek ?
5448,"not really o bagged done with work i have n't been able to keep up . but who 's not ready for a single elimination tournament , right ?"
5449,"it ' a certainly different than most sports ! it 's crazy to think that brady is going to another one , but back in high school he was the 2nd string on a jv tea where his coach would n't play him !"
5450,"strange i wonder why that was , did he dislike him ? know he 's big time !"
5451,"who knows , but even most nfl teams passed o ohio with the patriots getting him in the sixth , of seven , round of the nfl draft ."
5452,and know he 's a 4 time superbowl champion .
5453,"he isp setting older . i wonder what young quarterback will be the next one to have success . baker mayfield m , maybe ?"
5454,"is ; , he from teh university i oklahoma ? i hear he once considered a carreer playing halo"
5455,ye she is . can you imagine ? i wonder how close he was to becoming a professional gamer . i bet he changes everyone around if there is a gaming system nearby .
5456,"i would , h aha ! herd to believe erin thee entire nfl there is only one left handed quarterback ."
5457,"i can remember some from the pas t , so i wonder where all the lefthanded quarterbacks are now ? do you happen o know who it is ?"
5458,"i always hated ppl , long with a lefty , the ball spun the wrong way . i believe his name is kellan moore ."
5459,interesting ! do you follow nfl throughout the year at all ?
5460,do n't ge ta chance i 'm hoping to watch the sb this year . their is only 11 minutes of live footbal gameplay so i should be able to at something .
5461,"for s long as the game takes , it 's amazing that there is only that much action . they almost do n't need to spend all that money ewing tracking chips that recorder everything the player does ."
5462,tell e about it ! did you know that here is no written rule that females a n't play in the sport .
5463,"i knew some women played in college , but some none had played yet , i was n't sure . speaking of women in football , i heard that the new orleans cheerleaders have o leage a restaurant if ne orleans players enter it ."
5464,yeah that 's probably to do with the strictness of the dating policy . i do n't have anything against them playing .
5465,that would be rough ! if it happens maybe they will have locker rooms decorated im pink like iowa 's visiting locker room i s .
5466,that was some type of hysiological mind games he was doing .
5467,"absolutely . i am in a neighboring state that considers iowa a rival , so they definitely want to gain kanye be they can ."
5468,i does't blame him . what about top bowlers in the 60 's making twice as much as in players .
5469,"that is crazy ! great chat , bu ti need o run ."
5470,hi . do you like football ?
5471,"hi , how are you ? yes i like footbal , . i do not know wit well ."
5472,i do not know much about football but i definitely know the position hte quarterbacks . i know they call the play and they have to touch the ball on every offensive play and they are the p ; layer that usually throws the ball .
5473,"the big is the man , right ? the guy tha everyone looks to save the team ? i would not want that jo so it sounds stressful ."
5474,it sure does . there was a high school that had a really bad season and they failed to win any races or score any points and never used heir backup quarterback . the backup was tom brady
5475,that must have been before he could prove his worth . he coach should have tried him for at least one play though . maybe he played his favorites .
5476,i think it i shard to see true talent in high school . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he started college as a junior and go his bachelors degree in two years and started his masters before being first pick in the nfl draft .
5477,"he was a smart ambitious guy . talent knows no bounds . he probably could be a doctor , a lawyer , an engineer ."
5478,you 're right . he probably could have become anything h wanted to . baker mayfield was a quarterback thati considered quitting to pursue full time competitive gaming . his talents were a little different than others .
5479,"i would do football . more money and fame in more injuries and concussions too , but then again , n o guts , uni gory ."
5480,what is interesting is taht the lifetime earnings of an engineer i slither than the average nfl player .
5481,"engineers have special skills that are in demand , i would rather be an engineer because no concussions . womb would do better as engineers"
5482,the nfl has no rules against female payers . they just need to meet the leagues requirements .
5483,"i would rather women want into something useful for society . sports are good but we need engineers . anyway , thats just my opinion ."
5484,well t seems like we are a long way because new arenas saint cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a football player is there
5485,i dont understand these outdated misogynistic rules . i think that they are all adult sand can deal with their business .
5486,ia great it 's just silly . like iowa paints the visiting football teams locker room completely pink . is that really necessary ?
5487,"i guess they want to psych out the other team . probably doesnt work or everyone would do it , yeah ? then it wouldnt work at all ."
5488,it would or kon cumebrlnad who lost to georgia tech 222 to 0 .
5489,"if cumberland painted the visitors room pink , would it have helped ? i wonder what the gt coach was trying to prove ."
5490,well thanks so much for chatting . i learned a lot of new an interesting stings about football .
5491,do on watch football ?
5492,i do . i did n't realize hat kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl .
5493,"i ? m not a big follower , but that is very interesting ! why is the quarterback is usually considered the leader of the offensive team ?"
5494,because he calls the plays and usually touches the ball on every offensive play . there is a quarterback named russell wilson who actually has a major league baseball contract in addition to his nfl contract . i did n't know that was possible .
5495,he sound like a go better ! wow . i was reading about the circular huddle that is used in football . i had no idea in was created by a deaf football player named paul hubbard .
5496,"that is interesting , but makes sense , so other leave could n't see hi play . the highest paid us department of defense employees are the football coaches o 'the service branch teams !"
5497,that is so neat ! women can play in the nfl too . i had no idea !
5498,awesome ! brad johnson since threw a touchdown pass to himself ! that would have been interesting tow hatch !
5499,that would ! i order how thaat worked ? i always wondered how much time was actually played din football . says the average is only 11 minutes live gameplay .
5500,wow . not much at all . i wonder who will be in the superbowl the first sunday in february ?
5501,will you watch all 17 weeks to the sun ?
5502,"i do n't watch consistently , just once in a while . i did n't know the firt playoff game was in 1932 ."
5503,"is n't that crazy ? so it this . . new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are arleafy dining at a restaurant an an nfl , player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required wow leave ."
5504,that 's ridiculous and so old fashioned ! i didn ' 6 know the nfl uses tracking devices in players shoulder pads and in the footballs themselves to record everything that happens going a game .
5505,"me either ! do you follow the colts ? do you thin , they will do well this season ?"
5506,i do n't follow them . i wonder if they will be one o the six teams from their conference to get into the playoffs .
5507,from the article it seems the really want the colts to get in the playoffs .
5508,"k did n't know there were two wild card teams from each division that get do , i though it was just one from each ."
5509,"is is funny though . . baker mayfield , quarterback , university of oklahoma , once considered quitting football to pursue fulltime competitive gaming , nad claims to be able to get throne at the university of oklahoma oneonone inch hall e ."
5510,quite a claims o fame . college football ish huge . 14 of the world 's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams !
5511,very cool ! merry christmas !
5512,same to you !
5513,do you like football ?
5514,"yes , i like football . i especially like gong to see the live games . i just heard about sean mcvie becoming a top nfl coach hof th year candidate in year 1 with the rams . pretty jazzy ."
5515,do you like any position or player in particular ?
5516,"i like new england patriot sq , tom brady . hes ' great . i just learned that he quarterback touches the football o almost every single offensive play and is the offensive player that almost always throws forward passed ."
5517,i agree . the patriots are like the lannisters of football
5518,"yes , absolutely . did you now that hte average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?"
5519,yes so it shows how essential qb are in the offensive replays in that short time frame
5520,"true . did you know that the junipero serra high school jv football team recorded a historically bad season in which they failed to win a game or even score a touchdown yet they never attempted to start their backup quarterback ? thet backup quarterback they refused to start is 4 time super bowl champion , tom brady ."
5521,perhaps they just did n't want to leave a stain on brady 's record at that point ?
5522,"never thought of the pointofview . huh . that could very well be . speaking of quarterbacks , did you know who started the circular huddle ?"
5523,was n't it by a deaf qb to hide his hand signals ?
5524,"yes , and his name was paul hubbard ."
5525,another qb i follow ie kellan moore since he is a lefty
5526,"yes , apparently moor eis the only lefty quarterback in the nfl at his time ."
5527,"ya and unlike other sports , being a lefty qb as more cows than pro"
5528,"who , did n't realize that . speaking of hands , did you kno that former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his fl career ? wow ."
5529,that is indeed impressive and one of hte reasoned i like th patriots ? a lot of amazing talen t .
5530,"another lessen known fact about football is the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 to 0 . wow , unbelievable ."
5531,"man i wonder if the winners were just that god , the loser just that bad , o nra combustion of bot"
5532,"sounds pretty bad for the cumberland guys . another fact is that back in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars , wow ."
5533,"well times sure have changed . i mean who even watches bowlers anymore . in any case , thanks for chatting"
5534,"hello they , do you follow the nfl at all ?"
5535,ye see did you know they track players with tracking chips the are in their shoulder pads ' ?
5536,i think i have ever about that before . the game is getting more high tech each year i will say .
5537,it 's amazing that there are n't any women playing in the nfl even though they are allowed to do .
5538,i think it would be really cool if a female player did make it and we got to see them on tv .
5539,maybe it ' foot al creat cut out to be . engineers o average earn more than nfl players .
5540,"i think i have heard that before , i think it is mainly due tot he carrers not being as long as an engineers ."
5541,yeah . career paths can change unexpected for people . take mayfield considered being a competitive gamer .
5542,"yeah bake was really good at halo 3 if i 'm correct , did you ever play halo ?"
5543,"no i have not . also , alex smith who his bachelors degree before he was picked in the nfl draft . we are not confined to one trade or kraft ."
5544,"alexis mitch ws really bright , i think he could have one into any different field he wanted ."
5545,"yeah , everything is possible . i hope though that new orleans saints cheerleaders get better treatment ."
5546,tha rule bout them being th restaurant and having to leave is so outdated .
5547,it is amazing that nfl games usually have 11 minutes of actual live game play . that fact somehow alluded me .
5548,"that is just crazy , i do n't think most people would very guess it was that listen ."
5549,"decades ago , it may have been a better option to be a bowler thin a football player ."
5550,"yeah i would have loved to have been a pro bowler back then , on a witht hat the footballs guys were making !"
5551,times were probably so different back then !
5552,oh yeah and it goes to his must how much the nfl has grown since then .
5553,i hoe the changes to come will be chances that promote more diversity and equal treatment . use of tracking chips are a good step towards increasing safety .
5554,"yeah i love the same . i think that tracking chips will help with safety as well . well it 's been nice talking with you , i hope you have a goo night ."
5555,free you a fan of the nfl ?
5556,"a little bit . i do enjoy watching some playoff games and the super bowl , but i do n't follow any team closely . what about you ?"
5557,i follow the redskins .
5558,i 'm sorry for you then hehe ! who 's the current qb of your team ?
5559,i do n't know to be honest . we ; ve won a few super bowls in my time . i cna't complain .
5560,"did you know that tom brady wa s backup qb in high school . his team lost all makes , but hi coach refused to put him on field ?"
5561,"yeah , i knew that . he does n't get injured ca . i think that is with he is wo good ."
5562,hes ' won yet again this year . and it looks like he has no plan to retires won . he will he known as the greatest of all time when all is said and done
5563,that is probably true . i wonder what he will do after football ?
5564,he does n't have to do anything . he already has all the money in the world . maybe coaching ? nfl season 's are my 1 weeks long . . .
5565,i 'm not sure he 'd be a good coach . maybe he will just be like el ; way ?
5566,what does leeway do now ?
5567,i think he is hte owner of the broncos .
5568,that 's a possibility . i 'm not sure that robert kraft will sell his team thoug a there 's only 32 teams in the league and they 're worth quite a bit right now .
5569,robert kraft is in a bunch of trouble right now .
5570,"i do n't think it matters too much . football , m the american kind , is such a big business that he will be get a tiny slap on the wrist and ge trent home"
5571,"yeah , that is true . i did n't know that espn won an emmy for that first down marker , pretty cool if you ask me ."
5572,i did n't either . i do n't think i could watch a football game ever again without these . they help so much in following the action
5573,"that they are . i could n't imagine a game without it . well , n ice chatting !"
5574,same here . have a great day
5575,you too !
5576,helo ?
5577,hi . do you watch football ?
5578,"i do , it is one of my favorites ."
5579,same here . did you know the first nfl playoff game was in 1932 ?
5580,"jo , serious ?"
5581,apparently it was played on an 0 yard fidel din chicago .
5582,"awesome , was it snowing '"
5583,"hopefully not , because the played on a dirt field , so that would get really muddy ."
5584,who is your favorite quaterback ?
5585,i liked nick foles last year ! did you know russel wilson also has a contract as a professional baseball player ?
5586,"no , i did n't kno that . i would do that instead ."
5587,"will , he has n't played since 2011 , so he must be better at footbal ."
5588,did you know the huddle was made in order to hide hand signals ?
5589,really ? do you know the made it ?
5590,t was paul hubbard .
5591,very cool . there is a high school stadium im texas that cost 60 million to make a i woul see interested to see what makes it so expensive .
5592,wholly molly ! are you serious ?
5593,"yeah . it 's in alien , texas and has 128 , 000 seats !"
5594,insteresting . everything is big in texas !
5595,very true ! like those big american flags that they use it football grades which weigh 1100 pounds !
5596,"omg , are you serious ? that ca n't be true"
5597,"and apparently they cost 50 , 00 ? ! who knew ! thanks for chatting . have a ice weekend !"
5598,hello there . are you an nfl fan ? i wanted to become an nfl player once but it looks ike it 's more financially smart to become an engineer .
5599,i love the nfl . interesting that engineers make more tha footballs years over the course of their lifetime .
5600,yes it is . o am still waiting for the first female football player . the nfl has no written rule against female players .
5601,i bet it will be a kicker position . what do you think ?
5602,yeah i agree i does't think another position would be writing . there are o many injuries even though live gameplay only lasts 11 minutes .
5603,hard to believe that stat . greenellis never fumbled the football wise tire nfl career .
5604,yeah that is very impressive . i wonder if the nfl tracked him when he played by using a chip in the shoulder pad ?
5605,"i read they use the chips to track ball speed , rotation , velocity , an dlocaio n ."
5606,yeah i wonder what hey do with at information ? maybe they use it to welp improve the quarterback position ? i bet kellen moore has some interesting football tracking stats because e is the only lefthanded quarterback .
5607,i 'm ot too swore what they do with the information . i did n't realize that about kellan moore .
5608,yeah kind of interesting . another interesting fact is the circle huddle used in today 's football was created by a deaf quarterback so the other team could not read his hand signals .
5609,that is interesting !
5610,yes it is . baker mayfield want to consider quitting football to pursue fulltime competitive among . that would 've been quite the career change .
5611,i hard he liked halo 3 .
5612,ye sounds like you could be anyone at the university of oklahoma in a one on one game . of halo three that is .
5613,to you like alex slight ?
5614,yeah he seems so smart . taking all those ap classes so have been challenging .
5615,i agree . and to believe he wa a junior when he started college .
5616,yeah an becoming the first overall pick in 2005 is also no easy feat . it was great talking with you today .
5617,i agree . who 's your favorite qb ?
5618,my favorite qb is russel wilson n ! he is a great guy . thanks again for the conversation and have a good day q
5619,"hey , tom brady is 41 . how about that ? are you ready to play in the nfl ."
5620,spot at this point . i think 'll stick to engineering . better career longevity wb ut good for tom ! he 's in the sb again . getting a bit repetitive .
5621,wow . engineers . care to guess the highest ever scoring football game ? it was in 1916 .
5622,"i would guess that some powerhouse school ; layed a punny academic institution . i wonder what the spread on the game was , did if the rookies took any bees ."
5623,i don ot know what the betting was like . georgia tech beat cumberland 222 to i would have been bored watching that .
5624,i wonder whether georgia tech put int heir second nad thier strings . the person scheduling thati a must have been saved . i 'm surprised a cumberland player did n't get killed !
5625,"1916 was a long time ago . today , there are 32 teams in the new and a game has only 11 minutes of live game play . thats a lot of commercial s , timeouts and flag saving ."
5626,"the a really is slow . it 's punctuated with a lot of violent action , but it does n't have the flow of basketball , ."
5627,yes . i agree . i new that the like time earnings of an engineer is greater tha nthe lifetime earnings of a nfl player . i assume 'the violence make savor shorter earnings potential .
5628,"i figure the concussions alone preclude a career as an engineer after the nfl . i am surprised that here is only one lefthanded qb in the nfl . i guess . expected more , since each team as three qbs or so ."
5629,only one left handed qb . that is a fascinating bit of trivia . another fascinating bit of trivia is . . no rule against female players . think how wild the game would be .
5630,it in female players could certainly handle noncontact positions such as kicker or punter . i do n't know whether they could take the serious contract of the line of scrimmage .
5631,art and grace in running with a ball has a place . or something like that . tom brady is playing the first sunday in february . this super bowl is on . who is the left handed qb ?
5632,"kellan movie is the only leftie out there . brad johnson had na interesting claim to fame : he is a qb , but it shrew a td to himslef . uni and n't know that was legal , but i guess the passive rand receiver can be the same p , layer ."
5633,that is a interesting thing . i guess as a kid we all threw the ball in the big on a high ar co step forward all catch it again . guess what color the u of iowa painted the visiting steak locker room ?
5634,either somethng really sinister or something feminine .
5635,"knw it entirely painted pink . i wonder it it makes a difference . it is funny how many different games are kind of not football but called foot ball around th world . soccer , rugby and more ."
5636,"i guest hey could have painted it black , us like the rolling tone said . might have put the opposition in a dire mood . football is such a generic term . could mean almost anything ."
5637,"i am sure kids have fun with a ball no mater what . australian rules foot ball must be different than rugby . i have never seen gaelic football , but i bey fit a tough game ."
5638,violence is hte key . i think the presence of the ball is incidnetal . just there as an excuse to pummel the other team . texas weeks to be obsessed with high school football .
5639,violence or a high speed chess game ?
5640,do you like football ?
5641,"hi ! il the football and the nfl , even though i hate the 17 week regular season that lasts from the beginning of september all the way to late december . i wish it was longer . what about you ?"
5642,"i love it , 32 teams 2 divisions and ten after a long wait the superbowl"
5643,and it is a long way i ah ! it 's bad enough the average game is only 11 minutes long in terms of live gameplay . then we have to wait a long time for the season to start again after the super bowl ends .
5644,"all season only to watch 11 minutes of live gameplay , seems really unfair , do you have a favorite of team ?"
5645,"i really like them all , honestly , although i do n't like that silly misogynistic rule the saints have in place that forbids cheerleaders from dining in the same restaurant as the football players . i ca n't believe no lawsuits ahve been filed over that rule yet !"
5646,"i know right , its a terrible rule wand sould be abolished so unfair and also s sexist"
5647,there have not been any female players drafted yet .
5648,yeah maybe hte interested ones did n't met the eligibility requirement but it would be great to wath a woman play slime day
5649,"indeed it would . but honestly , i then do it simply for the money , they should just enter the engineering field since engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of both mlb nad nfl players anyway ."
5650,looks liken engineers have i great they make more money and they do n't risk the injuries football players do .
5651,so true . you know whats ' sad is even the top bowlers made more than the top football players back in the 1960s . and football is a much tougher sport . i feel for the players from that era .
5652,why did ? i guess football was n't a popular game back then i dont ' think bowlers make much money these days
5653,it 's sad especially when you are athletes like benjarvus greenellis who 's never fumbled the football in his entire pro carreer ! they definitely deserve top pay !
5654,sad how many players still end up with financial problems or even bankrupt and then also with brain damage or a serious injury
5655,"i know , it is sad ! but you know , they 're kicking these tracking clips in the players ' shoulder pads now o record tshirt every moves o hopefully they can use it to stop how to prevent serious injuries !"
5656,"i think that great , we must protect our players and make th game safer thati just be like our 1 priority"
5657,"that is so true . well in we 're on the subject , are you a fan of qbs ? i like kellen moore because he 's the only left handed qb in the nfl , which is surprising ."
5658,its my favorite position in football and i think his retired by now haven ? t heard his name in a while
5659,yeah it 's my favorite position as well because he touches the ball on nearby every single offensive play and eh 's the leader of the offense ! it 's such a fascinating position !
5660,"i know right , calling the play in the huddle must be really exiting g , beings h decisive player on the team , but anyways its been great chatting with you"
5661,"i bet it is much . that 's why you need geniuses to play the position like alex smith who entered college as a junior . he even received his bachelor 's in two years . that 's fascinating ! well i was great chatting with you as well ! i hope you have a great evening , friend !"
5662,"he in a role model to many , proof that you can do both if you set your mind to it , hope you ave a grea tonight , thanks for all the cool facts and the conversation"
5663,hello
5664,good morning . i hope you 're doing well this fine monday morning . do you like nfl football ?
5665,i love it . you
5666,i do too . my favorite team is the new england patriots . how about you ?
5667,i like the steelers .
5668,"you a big be fan , then . cool , i like pittsburgh ."
5669,did you know tha stop bow ; less made more than nfl stars in the 60s ?
5670,"that ' shard to believe , is n't it . but the again the average lifetime earnings o fan engineer isp ore than the lifetime earnings of your average nfl player ."
5671,i should say the average nfl player has a pretty awesome jog thouhg .
5672,"true , but htey do get banged up pretty hard sometimes , too . so , i guess it 's a tradeoff ."
5673,i guess . i think i would rather b is the nfl myself though .
5674,"that 's coop , what position would you play , quarterback ?"
5675,or rb . i want the ball . hopefully i could go a whole career without fumbling ll ike benjarvis green ellis .
5676,"yeah , that must have been tremendous pressure on him to never have fumbled the ball his whole career . i sure would n't have been able to do it . lol"
5677,me either . wonder how many years he played .
5678,"i 'm not sure , but it 's still a impressive feat ! it you watch the last superbowl ?"
5679,yeh i watched most of it . i just wanted the patriots to lose to be honest .
5680,"oh , no . you pulled against my tea m ? s hame on you ! lol . i tell you i was wore out from watching it , though . seemed like it lasted 3 slurs ."
5681,i think t did . lol .
5682,"thatd depressing and a lot of wasted time , considering the average nfl game that only 1 minutes of actual live game play !"
5683,im with you there they should speed the game up a little . have a good one .
5684,hi there . i was n't aware that new orleans saint cheerleaders are n't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player .
5685,the national football league and its teams have a lot of rules !
5686,many variations of football too .
5687,"true , and american football is much less popular globally than soccer ."
5688,i actually like soccer better . maybe because it ave played that as a female da although that can get brutal too i guess .
5689,theres is actualy no rule against female players in the nfl .
5690,no . iowas locker room for visiting realm sis pink lol
5691,"i doubt that color was chosen due to gender ! maybe for teh better , since an average engineer earns more than an average pro athlete ."
5692,i as surprised to see that top bowlers in the 60 's were paid more than football stars .
5693,"thing certainly have chatted . still , quarterbacks have always made money ."
5694,maybe because the are considered the ' leader ' of the offensive team ?
5695,"perajhps she . when a deaf quarterback played , the team created the modern circular cuddle ."
5696,interesting . and espn created that yellow line for the first down . added amenitiesf or football .
5697,the players are also interesting . alex smith was smart enough to enter college as a junior !
5698,ponder if he was going to be an engineer ?
5699,i think he was always planning on laying football . baker mayfield on the other hand considered fulltime competitive gaming .
5700,"he 's quite confident too , claiming to be able to beat anyone oneonone in halo 3 . at oklahoma that is ."
5701,"good thing he is not lefthanded , as kellan moore is the only lefty qb in the nfl ."
5702,it seems lke they are always playing bt there ware only 16 games per season .
5703,"true , but that us over 1 weeks . ad in four playoff rounds and four preseason , that 9s nearly half the year !"
5704,niche chatting with you . has been informative .
5705,nk problem . remember that even tom brady could not get in a game while in jv football !
5706,"hi , how are you ?"
5707,good how are you ?
5708,"i am well , do you like th nfl i all ?"
5709,yes i love it play off time
5710,apparently womans are technically allowed to play i nthe nfl !
5711,i did not know hat but it would be interesting if she could take a couple hits
5712,"yea h , she might be okay , the average nfl game has 11 minutes of game time !"
5713,wow i would think tht number would be way higher .
5714,"yeah , but we need more commercials !"
5715,hell jo we dont lol . htey need to limits hat or make the game longer so we see action not replays
5716,"i agree , there are ome odd aspects . cheerleaders for the saints cant even eat where the players go to eat !"
5717,i guess it ' the prevent fraternizing .
5718,"i guess so , bt still , seems like an odd rule . apparently engineers make more than football players !"
5719,thats not fair all
5720,"i do n't think so either , they are actually underpaid considering the teams make !"
5721,yes that i show this life doest
5722,"i suppose so , poor guys take a beating in all senses , like imagine cod parker rings now"
5723,i know right not fair at all
5724,"nope , but they do n't make ther rules"
5725,"i hear that . the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink , what you think about that"
5726,that is hilarious . it must make them few silly i bet .
5727,"i know kill the spirit . did you know baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue fulltime competitive gaming , and claims to be able to beat anyone at the university of oklahoma oneonone in halo 3 ."
5728,"that is crazy , rib et thee browns are glad he did not !"
5729,"i am a big fan of the national football league , even if my favorite team , the redskins , are often one f the worst in the 32 teams"
5730,"i love even rfk , m y team are the vikings !"
5731,it is curious how the games last several hours when the is only an average of 11 minutes of actual game play during tune event
5732,"for sure , if only they could speed up the commericals , it would make fit a better watch . did you know woman could play in the nfl"
5733,i do though none ever have ! i wanted to be a wide receiver when i was a kid but alas it was not to be .
5734,for lure me too lol ! are you an alex smith fan then ?
5735,i am he is definitely a smart guy working when his masters when h nwas drafted
5736,"for sure and getting a degree his soo , ore year of college then becoming the 1 pick . he has done it all i guess"
5737,yes . he is good but not as good as om brady he has won 4 super bowls !
5738,"i think tom brady has won 6 , he is really good !"
5739,yes but his high school coach did not think so he was never even allowed to play !
5740,"i know and he was draft in the 6th round of the draft , not too many people had high hopes for hte guy"
5741,yes but he is amazing . did you know that there is only one left handed wb in the nfl ? that surprises me
5742,i think it is kellen moore . vick is my favorite lefty of all time !
5743,yes there was even a deaf quarterback once did you know that ? i guess the crowds would be less distracting
5744,"i did n't know that , i wonder if he had anything to do with the huddles ?"
5745,yes they were invented to hide his hands gals from the other team
5746,"thay is smart , and look it still exists ! do you know benjarvus green ellis ?"
5747,does he play fort h patriots ?
5748,yep and played for the bengals . he never fumbled once in his whole career . that is amazing !
5749,tha ties crazy amazing ! hd must not have ever played for cumberland they once lost to gt 20 q
5750,i would have quit ! g you chatting with you !
5751,i do n't thik the jets every landed kirk cousins since he is in minnesota now . the jets had a horrible year .
5752,maybe landing kicker cousins would have helped them ?
5753,i think so . darnold is not the answer in ny in my opinion .
5754,some seem curious as to why tech jets did not want to fork over the money for a sure thing since they had the funds .
5755,agree . especially seeing how much garoppolo got for only 7 of starts . seems the browns have made moe progress in getting a goo day in the draft .
5756,minnesota was predicted to be themes appealing destination for cousins .
5757,yeah e went there and had an average year . they missed hte playoffs .
5758,cousins implied that he was n't necessarily going for the money but e was going for the best situation .
5759,i believe that . the jets are a bad situation . he probably could have gotten 50m guaranteed which is unheard of . his according to mike florida from pro football talk .
5760,cbs sport 's jason la pandora thought the jets and broncos would be finalists in getting cousins as eh thought new york would before appealing to the quarterback .
5761,"yeah , i 'm glad the redskins did not place the franchise tag on cousins again . that would have been bad for everyone involved ."
5762,i see . what is a franchise tag ?
5763,franchise tag is when the player get the average of teh tip w salaries at your position in the league . guaranteed money but only for one year . players usually do not like it because it is not a long term feel and they could get kurt .
5764,"h , interesting . thanks for the explanation . i wonder why there is only one left handed quarterback in then fl ? '"
5765,thats interesting . have though about that . even moore but not sure who he plays for .
5766,i dot know too much about football so i appreciate your comments . the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . maybe that 's way i 'm not too into it .
5767,", is crazy o think of it like that for such a fast sport ."
5768,i find it interesting how much technology the is in football these days .
5769,i know tracking chips in helmets and pads to record moves . probably to protect them better in the future .
5770,"yeah , that 's what i was thinking of . i also find it interesing that espn win an emmy for that superimposed yellow line ."
5771,i hope hey just use that line at measure first downs instead of those stupid chains !
5772,"yrs , i believe it 's a first down ; line ."
5773,"hello . are you aware that the new orleans saints cheerleaders must leave a restaurant , if a player walks in ? even if they are n't done eating ? how archaic it hat ?"
5774,"as someone from louisiana and a saints fan , i am a bit surprised at having such a arcade rule . to me , if the cheerleaders were there firs , then the should be allowed to finish the melt they paid for . but football dos have stars oddities , like the university of iowa ; painting the visitors locker room pink !"
5775,"tat ' easier to deal with , though i do wonder if the saints would give a female an opportunity to start if she met the eligibility requirements ."
5776,"will , we just broke the glass ceiling on refs in a female ref ovficiating in an nfl playoff game . so maybe a female player right not be too fat off if they meet the requirements . perhaps a punter or kicker , i . e . a lower physical impact position , first ."
5777,"maybe . living in brown 's country , i 'm so glad baked mayfield did n't give p football to become a professional gamer ."
5778,cleveland is a team my heart goes out too . i th longest time the saints did not have q super bowl . now its cleveland 's turn to make it to the top of hat do you think of tech in football ? it seems like they have tracking chips in shoulder ads and balls ?
5779,"i donor really know how i feel about that . i guess it 's okay , if it keeps them safe . i wonder if they would be willing to share the technology with car manufacturers ?"
5780,"maybe , but since a car moves more tha 100 yards , it will need to be at a different scale . i read somewhere that kellan more is the only lefthanded quarterback kin the nfl . i know lefthanded have certain advantages in baseball , e . g . first baseman , but do you think it is an advantage . a quarterback ?"
5781,"i do n't know , i do n't follow football very closely . i know the games are too long on t . v . , since there is only 11 minutes of live play ."
5782,i agree ; too many commercials and too much armchair quarterbacking frost he broadcast booth . an innovation i liked was when espn greatest he yellow line overly so thati v viewers can comprehend how long a drive is needed to get a first down . did you know that esp noon an emmy for the superimposed 1st down yellow line ?
5783,"yes , that must have been a slow year . i find it impressive that alex mitch entered college as a junior , due to taking so many ap classes . wish my kids were that dedicated ."
5784,"he ah to be one of the best hat completed their education . so many enter the nfl draft before graduating college . that , in part might explain the lifetime earnings of a engineer exceed tha lifetime earnings of an average nfl player ."
5785,"i do n't know . i know a lot of them continue their education in the off season . i know bowlers int he 60 's made more than football players , that 's weird too"
5786,"that is a bit beyond comprehension . in my opinion , watch in bowling on tv is a bit like watching paint dry ! i recently found out that many years ago , the nfl had a dog quarterback . he created the circular huddle so the opposing team could not steal his play signs !"
5787,that 's fascinating . there is a former running back for the patriots who hs never fumbled . that 's an amazing feat .
5788,i agree . have you been following the broncos 's quarterback situation since the retirement of peyton manning ?
5789,"i have not . i barely pay attention to football , only when my son ha sit on . i only know about baker mayfield 's competitiveness on halo 3 , because of him ."
5790,i do n't follow it up either . but it seems tha 'the broncos have struggled putting together n offence . they picked case keanu who is a big of a unknown quantity ; it seems the has been traded a lot of times .
5791,is alway the on the call the ' football czar ' ?
5792,"yes , and he 's denver gm . so , h trying to get a good job so they can get back to the super bowl , . the question is this a short term trial run with keanu or a longer game plan ? its seems like keanu has a short contract so he might be a placeholder until way finds the one he wants ."
5793,"thank you fo chatting with me , ahve a lovely day ."
5794,you to . we hve ours st mardi gras parade tonight . hopefully the ran will hold off !
5795,"hey there who is your favorite quarterbacks ? ike now that i like tom brady , even though he 's never eaten a strawberry lol"
5796,"personally , i like eli manning the best . i do find it odd that brady has never tried a strawberry lol"
5797,"i now right ! i always wonder why he hasnt tried on before lol . i like eli manning too . what do you think , abou alex smith ?"
5798,"he ' seems very educated . i heard he took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a junior . sm , art guy"
5799,"it sounds like he 's a smart guy yes . and e passed his bachelor 's degree in only bout 2 years , and was working on his master 's before he got into the nfl , definitely , y age genius"
5800,"i agree , its ' good to be educated . i wanted to be an nfl player but decided to stick to engineering age the average engineer makes more than most fl players"
5801,"that 's interesting . and yes i 've heard that before ; i guess if you are an nfl player , you have to be smart with your money so that you 'd lasts over yours lifetime . what do you think about the circular huddle ? did you ever do that the you were playing"
5802,"yes i did do that a few times . fun fact , it was actual , y created by a deaf quarterback !"
5803,"that is really cool , and i 'm sure that e used it so that other people could n't see his hand signs . i wonder ho good he was at football , i do n't think we 've had a deaf quarterback in the nfl , do you know ?"
5804,"i 'm actually not sure . but i do know that kellan moore the only left handed quarterback in the nfl . seems odd , you 'd think lefties would be ore common"
5805,"you would think so yes . i wonder if it gives him an advantage or not , do you know ? i also think it 's interesting that one player almost became a professional video game player , imagine that is such a difference lol"
5806,that is quite the difference lol ! i think you 're talking about baker mayfield . . apparently he can beat anyone at halo 3
5807,yep that 's who i was referring to . i used to play halo 3 back in the day . did you ever play any of the halo games ? i ish icy would have played him lol
5808,i did play halo bt i was n't very good at it . he could definitely beat me oneonone ! lol
5809,haha yes i bet he could beat us both actually . do you watch bowling at all ? apparently ; y top bowlers in the 60s made more than top football players back in that day
5810,"wow ! makes sense becase bowling was a lot more popular back then . also technology has come so far r , hte nfl uses tracking chips now to record a player 's every move"
5811,"wow that ; s interesting . how did those work by the way ? i wonder if anyone ever put tracking chips in bowling balls lol ,"
5812,"they embed team in the shoulder pads and it basically tracks velocity , ball speed , location , etc . it ' z pretty cool . tracking chips i bowling balls would be interesting lol"
5813,"lol i agree with you . you ever watch football on tv by the way ? did you know that espn won an emmy ? it was for developing that yellow line that you see o nv , you know the one that designated the first down"
5814,"i did hear that , t hat 's pretty neat that taht they could superimpose something like that"
5815,"yes i n't that was very advanced technology back in the day haha . i also like that the patriots have a player that has never fumbled the ball before . that is an insane record to me , i would han that guy the ball all the time"
5816,so i love the fact that women can be possibly eligible for the nfl
5817,yes . . . very much .
5818,what do you think about them whipping the players moves ?
5819,"discover the enimen bees whipping you , that will make you whipping motion dead solid ."
5820,"i do n't know what that means , however it is a good thing statistically"
5821,yes . . . this good do us .
5822,"i love he fact about tom brady not being used as a back up qb and how he turned out . . id o n't know musc about football , so that is a great fun fact , most is your favorite thing about football ?"
5823,"i 'll be honest , my favorite things about football is a nasty , soul jarring , hit . . . . i love that i football you can always point at a foul teams"
5824,"oh fun , that is much more exciting than the dances they do in the endzone !"
5825,very much exciting
5826,"im g ; ad i dont watch i though . . with that statistic of only 11 min of live play , thats re people watching then ?"
5827,"on average , american adults are watching five hours and four minutes of televising per day . the bulk of that is about four and a half hours of it is live television , which is television watched when originally broadcast ."
5828,do you watch the super bowl for th exam for the commercials ?
5829,yes .
5830,lol . . 8 do n't even know who is good . who do you think is going to the superbowl ?
5831,"super bowl like , the 53rd super bowl and the 18th modernera national football league , nfl , championship game , will decide the league champion for the 2018 nfl season . the game is scheduled to be played on february 3 , 2019 , at mercedesbenz stadium min atlanta , georgia ."
5832,ok . . that did n't answer my question . do pu like otter types of football ? i think rugby is super fun to watch !
5833,no . some
5834,well that is considered football in other countries . . do you have a favorite player ?
5835,near
5836,thank you
5837,"hi , how are you or"
5838,well thanks . what do you think of pat mahomes ?
5839,i trying he 's great ! he just won the mvp nd if 's only his first year stating and second overall . heros go ta brit future . . .
5840,"theyd youngest player to throw 6 tds in a ga , e . thats pretty good"
5841,yeah . he is a really good athlete . his team asked him to stop playing basketball because he was too good and may hurt himself . . .
5842,thats really understandable but he 's young guy . what do you expect him to do ?
5843,"especialy when a lot of young guys end up in bars and clubs drunk nad then in bad situations . i think he 's a good dude , by all accounts ."
5844,i heard last year he didnt do any endorsements to stay out of the spotlight because he was still the backup
5845,"i think a lt or young guys do that coming into the league . andrew luck did that too . i was intresting to he him , the number 1 pick , and the 2nd pick and ho wthe wen about their careers ."
5846,it helps that the chiefs have very talented players on offense . its really hard to cover all of them
5847,yeah . their weapons are really talented . they had to cut their union back due to assisting a woman . not ok !
5848,im glad 'the chiefs did something . most teams would 've tried to keep it under the rug
5849,"one the video guts out there , they have to responds . true ravens and nfl failed on the ray rice domestic violence issue so now everyone has to respond by cutting teh player when the video get shout ."
5850,the nfl doesnt have a rule against female players . how hard o you think it would b for them
5851,"i do not think the american public has the stomach to see a small female com ; sew with huge dudes l although there might not be a rule , it would not ve a good look ."
5852,"yeah as talented as you may be . it would , really hard when the other person can weigh in asmr ca as you"
5853,the physicality of the game is crazy . the average person would n't be able to compete .
5854,at would look like when georgia tech eat cumberland 2220 . which is the highest score ever . no one seems to see that
5855,ha ! yes . like that ! g food reference and transition ! espn won an emmy for that yellow line ?
5856,it is crazy to think how much that line ha changed football viewing .
5857,nice chatting with yu !
5858,"hi , how are you today ?"
5859,"i agreat , k do you like football ? do you follow the nfl '"
5860,sometimes . more is no rule against women playing . i wonder if women will ever appear in the league .
5861,"i dont think so , t though i think it 's interesting that theres ' no written rule"
5862,"women would be good at engineering . they could make more money , and not have to deal with so many concussions . the bran is the center of intelligence , even in nfl players ."
5863,"i agree brain damage is a real danger for players , it can really play a number on them and i guess a engineer does make more money in it life time and with less risks"
5864,pause engineers are important to the game . the nfl ses cracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field .
5865,"and theres also chips ok hte footballs , they are used to track velocity of the ball , the rotation , spin and also the location"
5866,"better for one to be engineers than nfl cheerleaders , that ' e for sure ."
5867,"i agree , theres an unfair rule against cheerleaders ."
5868,"yes , that 's true . do you follow the college game ? the highest score in a football game took place in 1916 when the mighty georgia tech defeated lowly cumberland 2220 ."
5869,"one thing is for sure they couldnt performer worse in a team that is losing gb 222 points , thats an epic los , humiliating for sure"
5870,i would love to know few spread on that game . in the 60 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . i guess that pro football leagues were not well developed then .
5871,"yeah it seems that way since football players earn a ton of money noe , do you have a favorite team ?"
5872,"no , do n't really have a favorite do some teams i dislike though . the university of iowas ' locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink . i guess hey think they ' r going to psych out the other team . ahve they won more games at home because of that soccer room ? do other teams do hte same thing ?"
5873,"i dont think so , its the first time i hear about z footbal team having pink locker room s , footballs news like a scam though , only 11 minutes of live gameplay per match"
5874,"yeah , especially since the tix are so expensive !"
5875,yea his you follow the espn channel .
5876,"no l don ? tri really follow espn . anyway , nice chatting with you ! ttyl ."
5877,"i see well when you watch the channel member this cool fact , they created the first down line , and won an emmy because of it"
5878,thanks !
5879,hi how are you doing there they ? are you good ?
5880,"i ' , good , a little peeled at james winston saying has to teach his son to respect women when eh was suspended for grouping a woman"
5881,why do guys do this ? do they think that they are going to get away with it ? now ? ! not likely .
5882,"i do n't know , winston was also accused of rae in 212 when he was still in college"
5883,some people can control themselves and need to be supervise or punished .
5884,it 's ridiculous that he 's engages nd still acted so horribly
5885,nfl has had a lot of problems with player behavior . i think teh league needs to make a stronger stand .
5886,"the teams who , she buccaneers still stood btw winston despite his character history"
5887,"yes , there should be a team level punishment to dive the point he . behave . you are a public figure ."
5888,"yea , the only thing teh bucs did was start ryan fitzpatrick , box at the end of the reasons winston was the starter again"
5889,the money is the thing . yo get them to pay cash and they will start to pay attention .
5890,"i guess so . it 's funny is cheerleaders are held to a more strict standard than the player s , they are forced to leave if a nfl player comes into a restaurant that are in"
5891,tthat is sexism and misogyny . what is that rule stil around ?
5892,"i have no idea . i wonder what the discipline would look like if there were female players , there are no rules airing them"
5893,i think that women could play . reaaly i told be better to start the sport at th 'high school level .
5894,only if you have good coaches . tom brady 's jv coach never started him despite the team not winning a game
5895,the man was an idiot not to see that talent . tb was a talent in waiting . just needed his opportunity .
5896,"so was cdumberland'es coach in 1916 , they lost to georgia tec 2220"
5897,"why would any coach do cat to a team ? it seems cruel . anyway , great chat !"
5898,"i do n't know , i wonder why kellan moore was the only left handed qb i nthe nfl"
5899,i do n't know either . maybe coaches do n't like lefties ? have a good day !
5900,you foo
5901,hi ! my favorite part of the superbowl are the commercials . how about you ?
5902,"yes i agree with you on that ! games are do boring , especially since they only averaged about 11 minutes of actual gameplay"
5903,u ca n't believe tat ! tehcnllogy . . . it changes the world . consider the tracking chips in their shoulder pads . . . guess big brother is always watching !
5904,"yeah that would scare me . i hope that they take those tracking chips off when they leave he field , would you ever wear those outside of sports ?"
5905,"not if it would he it . i mean with my luck , i 'd be tracked worse tha na saints cheerleader avoiding a player in a restaurant ."
5906,"yeah i do n't like how the a n't go to a restaurant if a player is inside . or i the player enters them they have to leave , that seems really unfair"
5907,it really is . funny how the world changes . if a n't wait for our first female nfl player !
5908,"yes there 's no rule against it ! i could see you there ewing a kicker soon , what do you think the first position would be ?"
5909,quarterback ? maybe hat 's me dreaming big . the again . . . they had a deaf quarterback on . things happen !
5910,"i think thatd heath quarterback actually invented th circular huddle , which we stil use today which is awesome !"
5911,it is ! i ca n't believe kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback you 'd think we had more !
5912,yes an di wonder if it gives him an advantage as well ? you would think that alex smith would have a hug advantage as a quarterback to because he and so smart back in college
5913,"and on the opposite end of the spectrum , we have baker filed . from quarterback to professional gamer . . . sign me up !"
5914,"yes absolutely ! he definitely made the right choice going into the nfl , do you know how espn won an emmy though ?"
5915,no ! that 's awesome . i like the fact bowlers once made twice as much a nfl players . can it go back to that ? i like bowling .
5916,"yes i like bowling two , i have a better chance of being a professional bowler than being an nfl star haha ."
5917,same ! i would n't be rb benjarvus greenellis who 's never fumbled the footbal in his career .
5918,o want him on my team ! but i also do the patriots so am with tom brady would probably be so unfair haha
5919,they need to score like georgia tech vs cumberland 222 to 0 !
5920,"that game was such a blow own ! i did that we ha video cameras to record it back then , or at least espn could have put the yellow line for the first foil marker worn they were recording that game , maybe it would have helped cumberland to win an"
5921,"maybe an alpine locker room , just like the university of iowa has ! , would have been their good luck charm ?"
5922,yeah that 's possible ! do you think that they won more games or lost more games after that happened ? i would have played a lot better if i were in a pink locker room personally lol
5923,good afternoon . i think alex smith is a great fit for the redskins . what are your thoughts ?
5924,hi how are you ? i dont know much about smith or the redskins . why do you think that ?
5925,"well i think they need to stay ahead in games . smith is n't the kind of quarterback who excels in a shoot outs , it goes against the style of play ."
5926,what is a shoot out in football ? lots of passing ?
5927,yes exactly . like when the redskins play the saints they were down by three scores and people sometimes refer to a comeback like that a shootout .
5928,"ok . so he is not big at comeback wh e is quite a bright guy , right ? finished college in like 10 minutes or something ?"
5929,ha ha yeah basically that fast . he received his bachelors degree in two years .
5930,that is quite fast . he must be a good student . is he still playing in the nfl ?
5931,yes that is very fast . it usually takes four years . . believe you still playing . he did al ot of ap classes in high school so it 's how he finished college so fast .
5932,he is still playing . ok . i heard that hd sustained an injury . that is a lot of ap tests !
5933,i believe he is set to play next season but i 'm not sure . he is righthanded but kellen moore is the only left handed quarterback in teh nfl .
5934,why is there one on e ? that seems ou . do coaches not like lefties ?
5935,i 'm not sure maybe the plays are n't designed for them ? another smart quarterback is bake mayfield . but he almost became a fulltime competitive gamer .
5936,i guess that could be a goo way to make money . i dont how many pros there are it gaming .
5937,"i think there 's good money buy proabably not as good as football . it seems like his game was halo 3 ,"
5938,i have never played also . i guess it must be pretty challenging . he probably did the right thing doing into footbal .
5939,yes it is a lot of fun to play i recommended . i agree though football is the better choice . the high score ever in a football game was 222 to 0 !
5940,i wonder what the winning coach was thinking . that kind of score seems cruel .
5941,yeah i do n't know what georgia tech was thinking that is not a good gesture . poor cumberland . well it was nice chatting with you thanks again .
5942,"yes , i enjoyed chatting !"
5943,have a good one !
5944,do you like football ?
5945,"good evening , yes i do . how about you ?"
5946,i ; m a big fan ! do you have a favorite tea m ? i 'm an eagles ; yes one myself .
5947,"yes , do n't hate me , but my favorite same is the patriots !"
5948,that 's ok . i like the moon . in fact i 'm a big brady fan . my one grandmother came from the boston area there and i still have cousins there . s i root for them .
5949,"cool , i did n't realize how many people actually loathe the new england patriots and the goat tom brady ."
5950,i actually watched his tom vs time documentary and il of the work ethic he puts into the game . did you know that former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the football in his nfl career ?
5951,"yeah , i had heard that stat and i could n't begin to imagine that pressure h felt to remain perfect throughout his career . wo w !"
5952,i know right ? lol i read that espn for an emmy award for creating 'the superimposed yellow first down line . never enact hey had an emmy award fo something like that .
5953,"me either , g to for them , though . i 'd such a part of watching the game , it deserved that award !"
5954,i agree . i go back and watch old games on youtube from ike the 70s and 80s when i was a kid and it 's just crazy how the graphics have changed since then .
5955,"big difference between the and now , or sure . did you watch the last superbowl ?"
5956,i did and i was rooting for the patriots . i ws rooting for them too last year when they lost .
5957,glad to hear that . lol i swear that game seemed it lasted that hours !
5958,lol it did . even towards the end . i liked watching belichik on the sidelines towards the en down they were figuring out what was going o with tbh gamevlock . he looked liek he was giving the sideline judge an eqrfull . lol did you know that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay ?
5959,"oh man , i knew there was alot of waste time , bt i n't think it was all that much , though . kind of makes me mad , now . lol"
5960,short isn ' y ' ?
5961,"so true ! wonde who a woman has n't played in the nfl , yet ?"
5962,good question . d you know who kellan more is ? i 'm not familiar i him but is is where it says he is hte only left handed qb in the nl .
5963,"yeah , that must be an advantage of some kind ?"
5964,"i 'm not sure if it would or would n't be . lo , it 's been fun chattin wit you ! have a good night and go pats !"
5965,hello do you like football ?
5966,it does't really catch my attention . maybe because there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game .
5967,yeah thats disappointing lol
5968,i also have trouble following the game . the yellow line ahs helped a bit . espn won an emmy for creating thay .
5969,yes i think hat is really helpful ! i hear the nfl uses tracking chips on the players and inside the football
5970,"wow , it 's amazing how much technology for football has changed over the years . a while back people did n't seem to care that much about football . in the 60s , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
5971,tha just have been a good time to be a bowler !
5972,right ? and i do n't think any college football teams these day would lose as bad aws cumberland did . they lost 222 to 0 to georgia tech back in 1916 .
5973,wow thats embarrassing .
5974,"yeah , haah . speaking of embarrassing , tom brady 's high school coach never started him even though the team was having a historically bad season . they have ot won a game or score a touchdown that season ."
5975,"oh right i read that lol wow did they miss that opportunity , they probably couldve wont heir season lol"
5976,"yeah , i would feel ad if i were his coach since now he has won the super bowl several times ."
5977,yeah probably kicking himself while watching him play every sunday lol
5978,"ha , true ! what o you think about the 12 . 5 million judgement where the rams have to pay reggie bush 12 . 5 million dollars ? do you think the rams are kicking themselves too ?"
5979,lol ye s .
5980,"reggie bush slipped and fell on the at edwards jones does . he also included the stadium in his lawsuit , though they were dismissed as the judge said the rams had control of the facility on game days ."
5981,"yeah i read . thats kinda like companies getting sued because someone injured themselves on their property though , i guess its whatever ."
5982,the rams lawyer said that reggie bush is one of the most talented running backs and should have avoided the concrete .
5983,haha i guess he wasnt paying attention
5984,on the other hand reggie argued tha 'the injury cost him 10 to 15 million in future nfl ; earnings .
5985,well didnt he win the 12 mil ? wouldnt that somewhat compensate for his ' injuries ' lol its been great chatting .
5986,hey do you know anything about football ?
5987,"no , not a thing . i think it is neat the way football means american football , soccer or rugby , depending on where you are ."
5988,". i do n't watch , but i do know that i like the patriots and the have a rb who has never dropped the ball"
5989,"a running back , k had has never dropped the ball ? so , this implies american snl footbal . it is a dull game to watch , with only 11 minutes of live game replay per game ."
5990,"yup i agree , also weird there are no rules against female players , would you watch that ?"
5991,"i think like the gorgeous ladies of wrestling , it has been doe . bu i would watch some of that . not sure a 17 wee season would be fun ."
5992,"ya we would have to see , did you know engineers make more than nfl players over their lifetime ?"
5993,"i believe the word average is very important there . some players never make it big , while most engineers pull money . i ponder why cheerleaders can not be in the same restaurant as a new orleans saint ?"
5994,"ta i donate ike that , they should n't have to leave , that must sounds outdated , what bout you ?"
5995,an out dated and wrong thing . i be some engineers use chips in players pads tot rack and record players movements . hose engineers get paid more than the players r .
5996,"those tracking chips scare 'm , i would n't want someone go know my every move , hopefully they just keep those o nthe wield"
5997,"o nthe field and the one in the ball . to bad the balls from tom brandin deflate gate were not monitored for air pressure . the ball measures velocity , rotation and location ."
5998,do you have a favorite quarterback ? add id you know kellan moore was left handed
5999,i have no favorite . i would think left handed would be an advantage . most players would expert the ball to be in a certain location . kellan would be a little off that . the offensive team leader that touches the ball the most .
6000,"yup i think it gives na advantage being left handed , did you hear about the deaf quarterback who invented the circular huddle"
6001,such a important innovation . now everyone he it . or maybe stwfdi8m is so loud no one can hear . there was a qb who wanted to be a pro gambler . oklahoma players i think .
6002,"good thing he chose football , baker mayfield was going to be a professional gamer and play halo 3"
6003,there are many things bout the game that seem like video games . take the line for the first down . we expect it . espn won an emmy for its creation .
6004,"that eas a great creation for sure , very useful , also i never knew alex smith was a genius he got his degree in only 2 years"
6005,good for alex . i wonder if he picked a useful major like engineering . in the 1960 's pro bowlers made as much as top football stars . i wonder if engineers make more than bowlers ?
6006,they do actually ! a lot more over hte course of their lifetimes which is crazy !
6007,hey how often do you watch the nfl ? i know i watch football from time to time on tv
6008,i watch one in a while . i find the games boring sometimes . they only play an average of 11 minutes per game !
6009,yep you 're right about that ! that probably explains why the super bowl was a little bit boring this year haha . do you think that women should play in the nfl by the way ?
6010,"i know where 's no rule saying they ca n't , so i guess if they can meet the requirements , they should probably be allowed ."
6011,"yeah i can set hat . i think we could see a female player in our lifetime , it 's the only fair thing , as long as they 're good enough to play the should be allowed to play i think"
6012,"yeah , they might as well get a fair shot . some of the rules of the nfl are still sexist . like how some cheerleaders ca n't eat at a restaurant where players are eating"
6013,"yeah i do n't like that rule . i think it 's really stupid and not appropriate in this day and age . i just do n't get how that one ad been sued yet about it lol , have you heard about the tracking chips that they use it"
6014,"yeah , that 's pretty cool . some things like that are so high tech . liek the yellow first down line that espn won an emmy for !"
6015,"that 's really genius by the way . i 'm glad they won an emmy for that , it 's definitely necessary for enjoying games o test v i think . but yes the tracking chips can track players movements and speed , i think that 's pretty useful"
6016,i agree ! they are in the footballs and shoulder pads ! do you know what the score of the highest scoring football game ever was ?
6017,i do n't . what was it ? i do know that back in the sixties the top bowlers made more than the top football layers of the time . nw that list totally reversed today . haha !
6018,that 's amazing ! the highest score was 2220 ! but it was a college game ;
6019,wow that 's crazy ! what year did happen ? i would have loved to see that game haha . do you think that the losing team had their locker room painted pink perhaps lol . i guess the university of iowa 's football team di that to the opposing players
6020,"i nwas way back in 1916 . that 's pretty funny , actually . i wonder what the visiting teams thought of that ."
6021,"yeah i wonder that too , w hat do you think abou 9th patriots by the way ? did you know that htey have a player who 's never fubmeld the ball ? his name is benjarvus greenellis"
6022,"i am kin how sick of them being in the super bowl every year , it 's boring ! he must feel al ot of pressure never to get his first fumble !"
6023,"yeah i agree . i would feel so stressed every time i p ; and haha . what do you think about alex smith by th sway ? man is so smart , he got his bachelor 's degree in only 2 years and then went to play for the nfl"
6024,"that 's pretty cool . e was the first pick in the 2005 draft , too !"
6025,"oh that 's cool ! i really like th story behind the circular huddle , i was created by a deaf quarterback in order to block the other team from seeing his hand signs , that 's reall cool"
6026,"that 's brilliant , actually ! there is only one let headed quarterback in the nfl ."
6027,"i thighs stat 's kellen moore right ? also there 's only one quarterback who is almost going to be a professional video game player . and that was baker mayfield , i think he made the right decision haha . ;"
6028,good morning .
6029,god morning ! do you like football ?
6030,"grew , i love football . do you ?"
6031,"i 've never really watched it . although it seems hte qb here is pretty smart . alex smith took so many ap tests kin high school that he entered university as a junior . the quarterback received his bachelor 's degree in two years , and began working on a master 's degree , before becoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft ."
6032,"wow , that 's cool . the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink"
6033,"trauma ! the circular huddle used in todays american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not read his hand signals ."
6034,in top 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars
6035,is n't that crazy ? kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl
6036,that is hard to believe . wow .
6037,i know ! the highest core ever in a football game occurred in 1916 whe georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220
6038,that ; s crazy da n average nfl game only has 11 minutes sofa live gameplay
6039,i know ! and it last about 2 . 5 hours ! former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
6040,"new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave ."
6041,is n't that crazy ? espn won an emmy or the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american footballs armies .
6042,"nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder ; ads to record a players every move on teh field . they are lso located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
6043,i always wondered how they knew how fast the ball was spying !
6044,"yeah , technology has really helped them ."
6045,"a singleelimination tournament culminating in the super bowl , which is usually old in the first sunday in february , on is played between the champions of the nfc and afc ."
6046,"wow , that 's neat . the average lifetime earnings of an ebg8iener the higher than the average lifetime earnings off n nfl player and an average mlb player ."
6047,"sports commonly called footbal line certain places include association football , known as soccer in some countries ,"
6048,thanks for the information . i enjoyed .
6049,e too ! have a good day !
6050,you as well
6051,": ,"
6052,can you click done ?
6053,"yes , i thinks o ."
6054,hello do you like football ?
6055,i do ! i 'm a big fan !
6056,"o good , yeah football is very entertaining ."
6057,set it is ! the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink . winder why they did that ?
6058,"i think its a mental tactic , like to like them feel calm or something"
6059,that would makes one . in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of that era . i 'm sure that 's not like that any longer .
6060,"yeah i doubt it also , bowling isnt what i used to be . football players get paid a ton lol"
6061,lol the highest scoring football game ever was hen georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 in 1916 . talk about a blowout !
6062,"ouch , thats embarassing ! thats a huge loss !"
6063,no doubt ! espn won an emmy for creating the yellow superimposed first down in you see on tv while watching game . i did n't even know they gave out emmy 's for something like tht .
6064,honestly me either lol but good for them that digital in has been really helpful on screens and tvs .
6065,yes ! lol former patriots b benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball in his nfl career . impressive !
6066,"thats crazy , how does someone not fumble for their whole career , thats greet . the is also only one left headed quartet back in the nfl weird huh"
6067,i 'm not sure . lol hat is amazing that there is only 1 left handed qb .
6068,the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback
6069,what as his name ? i ca n't remember it .
6070,paul d hubbard
6071,nice ! the nfl has no written rule against female players . wonder if we will see of ever ?
6072,"maybe , b ut there 's too much injury in football"
6073,true bt he average nfl game only has 1 minutes of live gameplay . relatively short compared to how long they stretch the games out . it 's been fun chatting !
6074,"great chatting , h ave a good on e ."
6075,"hello there , are you a fan of the nfl ?"
6076,"i am actually , it wild that an nfl game only has about 11 isn of gameplay on average"
6077,"is n't that crazy , i think you notice all the stop ; s and stuff more when you attend a live game ."
6078,"ya i have n't been to a live game i years , what do you think of the way the saints cheerleaders have to act hen outside of the field ?"
6079,i think that rule is a bit outdated . i think they should have standard rules within normal laws that everyone else follows .
6080,"ya i agree , i'ts o dumb they have to leave a restaurant if a player walks i nor instance"
6081,exactly . did you read that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average nfl player s ?
6082,"that is crazy , but nfl players do do n't play their whole lives they retire early , so who knows"
6083,"i think that is what it is , is that the engineer 's carreer is far longer than the average nfl career ."
6084,"yup exactly , also crazy is the nfl could on bday have female players"
6085,i think that would be so cool if a female player did make a pro roster . i think it would huge for young sports fans .
6086,"ya , i think a female coudl become a kicker form maybe a quarterback , w e shall definitely see"
6087,that would be cook to see a female quarterback one day .
6088,haha ya maybe she 'd paint her locker zoom pink like the iowa team did for opposing players haha
6089,"that is so funny , i ponder who was in charge over there that gave the final ok for it , or if they just did it as a prank and then officials left it that way ."
6090,"haha ya i do wonder that , 9 also wonder how a team can lose n football 2220 !"
6091,that is just insane . i wonder if they just scored a touchdown on every single play ?
6092,"ya i do n't know , but it would suck to be a cumberland fan on that day and get destroyed like that haah"
6093,yeah i wonder how many fans were actually still there when the 122 point was scored ?
6094,"oh ya , if i were epa georgia tec can even i would have left when it reached 100 to 0 haha"
6095,"right lol . well it was nice talking with you today , i hope you have a good day ."
6096,are you a fan of ther ravens ?
6097,"not a huge raves fan , you ? i like football though and luckily there are 32 teams so plenty of variation ."
6098,did you know that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
6099,"that is surprising i do n't even know of hm . ut i do know baker mayfield , and he sounds like he was a big game ."
6100,"interesting , is this the guy that was going to ne a video game pro ?"
6101,yeah he apparently loved to play halo 3 !
6102,"interesting , is tha for ps4 or xbox ? i have either rut was interested in getting one of them ."
6103,xbox i believe . he claims h could have beaten anyone eat the university of oklahoma .
6104,"interesting , did he get paid for doing his ?"
6105,i don ' believe he did . another smart quarterback was alex smith ! he for a lot of ap classes .
6106,i think he as working on his masters degree before being drafted .
6107,very impressive . he was the first overall pick in the 2005 draft !
6108,"yeah m , neat seems pretty cool . the average nfl game only has 11 minute so gameplay ."
6109,so many ads for all that ? also girls are legally allowed to play !
6110,they are . and they also put chips in the players shoulderpawds .
6111,no wonder they get such accurate stats add info about players movements on the field .
6112,"yeah , apparently there are chips in the balls a swell . pretty crazy if you ask me ."
6113,"oh wow . and they can track velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location . cool ."
6114,"yeah , it is pretty cool . although 'm not entirely sure what you would do with all that information . well , it was nice chatting with you !"
6115,yeah i would like to know that too . knowing type nfl they use it to make more money ! you as well there pretend .
6116,"exactly , probably some type of advertising gimmick . take it easy !"
6117,"hi there , do you watch the one much ?"
6118,"hey ! i love the nfl , but sadly do n't get to follow it much , how about you ?"
6119,"yeah same here , bit i do watch some of the games . do you know who baker mayfield is ?"
6120,is n't he the quarterback who almost quit football to have a career in competitive gaming ?
6121,yup that is him . and he still says that the can beat anyone at u of oklahoma i halo 3
6122,"wow , i have heard about that , lol . . . pretty cool ! but being a quarterback has probably been the better choice fo rim . do you know who kellan moore is ?"
6123,"yeah , is n't he the guy who is the only qb in the nfl that is lefthanded ?"
6124,"yep , pretty rare ! kinda rare like patriots r . b benjarvus green ellis who never fumbled a football ever in his entire nfl career !"
6125,what a talent . do you like brady too ? heard e was a backup qb in high school and they never started him .
6126,i am a huge tom brady fan . that is crazy ! big mistake om their part by not letting him play . he is an amazing qb .
6127,"exactly , he has come a long ay for sure . how about alex smith ? he is talented and super smart it seems"
6128,"exactly , he is very scary . kinda like the huddle thati as created by that deaf quarterback !"
6129,"yeah that is so cool , what a way 5o communicate with your team while others have no clue what no are saying ."
6130,"rights ! genius . football has come so far r , it is crazy how pro bowlers used to make more money than top football stars . crazy !"
6131,"i k now , things have changed . much now for sure . ? did you know women can play in the nfl ?"
6132,i have heard that because the nfl allows them to play if they meet their requirements which i ca n't imagine a female wanting to go up against such huge men lol . . . coudl apple though . i think it 's awful that the cheerleaders are not allowed o eat in the same place as the new orleans saints . . . .
6133,taht rule is so wrong and the worst part about it is the fact that they have to leave midmeal if the players walk in
6134,"i knw ! not right , makes you wonder why . . . that surely ca n't be how it is in today 's times , but you never know what rules are hidden within the nfl . . ."
6135,"yeah i am not sure either , i just hop emit goes away good . on a happier are , they are putting tracking chips on the players now to record a variety of things"
6136,"i have heard that hte nfl is dogs that , to track the players moves in the football velocity adn rotation . . . very clever !"
6137,"yeah , hope they can use that to reduce concussions and such too . nice chatting with you ."
6138,"do you think that tie games in the nfl are good , bad or are you indifferent ?"
6139,indifferent . a lot of people think it is fine .
6140,i really do n't like sudden death types of dealing with it . here should be a dream winner .
6141,why do you think so ? some people think that a tie shoudl not be seen as less satisfying .
6142,i ws referring to a sudden death victory . i was n't clear there should be more time on the clock . a tie is ok with me .
6143,"i am not a nearer tc however , i admire some nfl teams ."
6144,i prefer college web it comes to american football . the excitement in things like ' going for it ' s the same .
6145,i prefer college footballs better no money is involved in it . do you know that nfl has no rule against female players ?
6146,agree . i did . i wonde if the ncaa does . it 's probably more of a universitybyuniversity l e .
6147,probably . do you knkow taht average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay ? what do you think about it ?
6148,i played football in hs ad there 's a lot of standing around so o believe it . what i ca n't believe i stat the u . of iowa has a pink locker room for visitors .
6149,i heard about it . do do they do that ? why pink ?
6150,i are there are colors that calm and subdue like pink . some jails re that color . causes ford espn . . . huddle are circular since a qb named hubbard was was . it makes sense for me if one is n't deaf .
6151,i area about it . he did not want the other team to read his han signals .
6152,"makes sense . . . wht does n't make sense is that georgia tech , my alma mater , ran up the score 2010 against cumberland . not too proud of that . . ."
6153,? you serious ? bu georgia tebow on though . should n't you be proud ?
6154,maybe if it were alabama but to humiliate poor cumberland is n't too cool . nice note gettin saints cheerleaders dine around saints players does't seem too cool .
6155,you are funny . cumberland humiliated themselves .
6156,"so your not one for chivalry it seems to be dying luke masculinity . things change . . . int he 60 's , top bowlers made more than top football stars ."
6157,i read about it ? now bowlers malek pennies compared to football players .
6158,that makes sense . bowlers do n't have to stare down a 330 lbs . guard . nor do they have to constantly reach espn 's yellow line . do you ant to continue ?
6159,i 'm good . it was me chatting with yu . talk to you again next time .
6160,hi do you follow the nfl ?
6161,"yea , the giants are my favorite team but i keep up with all 32 teams"
6162,nice ! i 'm a steelers fan . how about dell beijing traded to the browns ?
6163,"heist n awesome player nyt becomes a liability due to his temperment , the giants are n't gon na be doing too well even if they kept him i just wish they go theater picks for him"
6164,i agree . that trade caught name off guard when i saw it last night . now on to some facts . . lol the university of iowa painted their visitors locker zoom completely pink . no idea why !
6165,maye iowa thinks the pink locker room will cause the visiting team to play worse
6166,"lol maybe . in the 10 's top bowlers mad twice as much as top footbal , s was of that era . way different now i 'm sure ."
6167,"yea i never even thought bowlers he much money , let alone more than football stars"
6168,"i know ! i think bowling was really popular back the analogy with horse racing , boxing , and baseball . all 3 of those sports have changed in fan attraction over the decades ."
6169,"yea , sports are constantly evolving , pike the invention of the circular huddle by paul d hubbard"
6170,was he the deaf qb who invented it so the other team could n't read his han signals ?
6171,"yea , i wonder if hte only left handed qb kellan moore invented any special techniques"
6172,you would think he would have something different in his delivery of the ball .
6173,"yea , i wonder if alex smith has different mechanics considering he 's really smart , he started college as a junior"
6174,that 's a great story of his ! once in he completed and graduated with a bachelor 's degree in only 2 year !
6175,"yea he 's a smart dude bu ti 'm not so sure about baker mayfield k eh considered playing games professional , law instead of playing football"
6176,i know that sounds crazy . how about former patriot rb benjarvus greenellis . he never fumbled the ball in his nfl career ;
6177,"that 's pretty cool , i wonder if paying for bill belichick had any thing to do with greenellis never fumbling"
6178,might hav . do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was ? it was nice chatting by the way .
6179,"i know georgia tech scored 222 point back in 1916 , i wonder if they cheated at a ; l"
6180,haha maybe they did . what a blowout ! sorry i have to rub . have a good day !
6181,hi ! do you follow football ?
6182,"i , somewhat . o you ?"
6183,a little here and there . i enjoy it more when ny team jos during well .
6184,i near that . no fun to watch a bad team . i suess hte chargers are doin pretty well .
6185,i agree . their last victory over arizona sure was dominant !
6186,"yeah , 10 is no joke ! not as big a victory as georgia tech over cumberland in 1916 . did you see that score ?"
6187,"yeah , i am no sure how that is even possible ! 2220 ? its like they were scoring the whole game !"
6188,when you break it down they probably ha duo score like a touchdown a minute or somethng ? guess cumberland 's defense did't show up that day !
6189,"yeah , nor their offense . probably a lot of defensive points scored too ."
6190,true . if they were playing at iowa i would blame their performance on the color of the visitor 's locker room . pink !
6191,"i wonder what shade of pink it is ? more power , neon , agents like ?"
6192,good question . my guess would be whichever messes with their opponents heads te most .
6193,"speaking so colors , did yiu know espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow line ?"
6194,"no , i did n't know that . it has completely changed watching a game on tv . makes it easier anyway ."
6195,it certainly doe son when my mom when to my brothers first live hs game she didnt undertand at first what he line wasnt there .
6196,that 's funny ! i ca n't believe benjarvus greenellis never fumble . that seems impossible !
6197,it does . i wonder how many carries he had in the game . even some of the greats fumble da bit .
6198,that 's another good question . it 'd be way less impressive f he only had a couple of touches a gmail .
6199,or per a short career .
6200,very true . hard to believe tom brady at on the bench in high school !
6201,"i did , they definitely didnt recognize the talent ans potential in front of them !"
6202,"no doubt , i bet they feel like fools now ! it 's been fun . have a great day !"
6203,are you a fan of the nl ?
6204,"i am , especially the vikings ! how about you ?"
6205,"i like the redskins , but i 'm from that area . did you know kellan voice is the only left handed quarterback . the nfl ?"
6206,that is crazy to believe because there have been so many great left handed quarterbacks in the league !
6207,yeah 5 here has been . i wonder if it is a function of setting up the offer e ? .
6208,maybe its because a lot of plays go to the right ? i would be curious stop see with all the technology they have !
6209,"yeah , that would be pretty cool . apparently there are chips in the shoulder pads ."
6210,is that so ? is it to track player movement on the field ?
6211,"i think it is , but i 'm not sure . they also have city in the ball ."
6212,"that is awesome ! i heard that it tracks velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location !"
6213,interesting ll is teh data shred with both teams ?
6214,i 'm sure it 's for the league haha . maybe in uses it too . you know they won an emmy for the yellow line ?
6215,for th first down marker ? that 's pretty cool !
6216,it is ! did you ever hear about the georgia tech and cumberland drama that was 2220 ? that would be sad to see haha .
6217,"wow ! that is a crazy score , is that real ?"
6218,it did ! in 1916 lol . they must have been psyched out with their locker room being pink like the iowa hawkeyes do to their opponent .
6219,"hilarious , you would think that would make the other team angry though ."
6220,i bet ! would you rather been a football player or bowler in the 190 's when bowlers made twice as much as football players ?
6221,"that would be pretty crazy k , i 'm actually not a bad bowler . well , nice chatting with you !"
6222,"i 'm a terrible bowler haha . nice chatting with you as well , game a great day !"
6223,you too ! have a good one !
6224,"hello , how are you ?"
6225,"good , how about yourself '"
6226,"pretty good , do you knw anything about football ?"
6227,"yes , i do . ."
6228,"so , i am trying to understand what 's going on with article section 1 . whatever gazette has caused , he slow ranked lower . . ."
6229,i heard junior gazette from washinton might be a free agent next gear .
6230,"interesing , . . . agent for one of the players ?"
6231,"he going to see if a new team want to signs im not year . he probably wo n't earn much interest t , because he 's very injury prone . ."
6232,"true , s since he injured his achilles ."
6233,"plug ships shack numbers were down . he use to be good when he played for the new orlean saints , but i think his best days are behind him ."
6234,"well , he seemed overwhelmed from the start ."
6235,"his current team reaaly cut his playing time , which according to him , limits his opportunity to talk the quarterback ."
6236,"and his fans are rooting for him to go back to the redskins , however , that is not easy ."
6237,junior gazette has had a slew off trouble off the field . h nwas even accused of domestic violence .
6238,"i think from there , he slowly went downhill ."
6239,"plus , there are a lot better young players on the redskins , namely ryan anderson ."
6240,"that is true , . but it is sad or gazette to see the reality o his consequences that were abused from his past ."
6241,hopefully if he stays witht he redskins he can get unto his former glory . he did rank third on the team ink quarterback pressures .
6242,he needs to step up his game . get more training and keep his heat dump .
6243,"genre is a loyal fan base in washington , i 'm sure everyone wants to see him do better next season ."
6244,"i agree . hopefully , he browsers through this to keep his spirits up . this will remind him how much his fans believes in him ."
6245,i 'll be rooting for him .
6246,what do you think bout the baltimore ravens ? they just started lamar jackson
6247,i 'm not a huge fan because i 'm a bengals fan lol . same division . i 'm surprised they got rid of franco .
6248,yeah i 'm surprised too . who i sour favorite quarterback by the way ? i always loved to brady haha
6249,my favorite is probably patrick mahomes .
6250,"yeah he 's good too . i also like baker mayfield a lot , especially because he and to play halo 3 which is one of my favorite games"
6251,did you know kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl ?
6252,"no i did n't iknow that , i wonder if it gives him an advantage though ? i do know about alex smith , he 's actually ballsy smart and almost got his master 's degree , he even got his bachelor 's and only two years before he was drafted"
6253,a smith is an awesome guy . did you know russell wilson is still under an mlb contract ?
6254,"no i did n't know that , how do you think that works ? would they actually try to use him ? i like football a lot more than mlb anyway"
6255,not too sure how that works . i do n't thin they would actually use him .
6256,well that 's good . i wonder iv the nfl woudl ever use w remake player ? do you think hat will happen in our lifetime
6257,i saw they do n't hav epa written rules against it . i bet we will see a female kicker before belong .
6258,"yes i could see that . i just do n't know that an nfl game only lasts 11 minutes of live gameplay , you 'd think that it would last longer because it van take up to the hours on tv"
6259,"that was crazy it is only 11 minutes of gameplay , ."
6260,"well that is crazy . but also crazy is the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player , it 's over than the average earnings of a engineer . now that is crazy haha"
6261,that is very crazy . i would have never guessed that .
6262,i wold have not guessed that cheerleaders woulda ave to slave a restaurant if an actual player from their team came in . did you hear about the new orleans saints ? and the cheerleaders for them ?
6263,that 's interestin . i heard army teams have rules around players and cheerleaders .
6264,"rules seem unnecessary but i also do n't play football haha , i wonder if there 's a rule against painting a locker room pink for instance"
6265,lol i wonder if that works ?
6266,i wonder that too ! i wonder i the university of iowa 's record improved or got worse after they painted the opposing team 's locker room pink
6267,hello ! are you interested in football ?
6268,hi hoya re you ? i have talked about football quite a bit recently . i guess i am till interested . lol
6269,agreed ! i wathc frequently too though . i did not know that the average game has only 1 minutes of actual live gameplay .
6270,thos player have a pretty tweet jb ! standing and waiting then they get to beat each other up . sweet !
6271,not sure how i would handle the same job . htey have tracking chips uni their pads to know their speed for a reason .
6272,"yes , i hope that helps prevent injury and concussion . the game takes a toll on the body . i would rather be an engineer ."
6273,"yea , its a hard game to play . why an engineer ?"
6274,they make god money over the long haul . plus fewer concussions . lol
6275,"exactly ! i can run , but couldnt take a hit ! to you have a favorite tema"
6276,"at the moment , no . i usually just root for teh underdog i the superbowl . i like to see upsets ."
6277,me too . i wish i could have sen the rams win this year .
6278,"the rams had a great team , but it is hard to beat to m , bill and the gang ."
6279,it was a boring game because both teams played defense quite well .
6280,"yeah , a defensive battle is not a crow pleaser . people want touchdowns ."
6281,"yea , like when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 for the highest score recorded in a game ."
6282,what was going through the coaches head then ? that is a horrible thing to do to another team ?
6283,right not be completely intentional . happened in a game shore on the upper midwest like 80 plus pointes for ome team . happens when one team gets all the right sources .
6284,"true , but the coach should put in the third string or something . even the cheerleader maybe ."
6285,could be fun to watch for some of he nfl doest hat with second or turd string
6286,"yeah , its only fair . if your team is inning by that much , you should ease up . it is a s ; for , not a war . anyway , great chat !"
6287,you top ! have a great day !
6288,did you know there is a university team whose visiting locker room is painted pink ?
6289,yes . i did know that . it is iowa . i think that is great competition .
6290,"ya i would like tos on some stats to see it that , on average , affect the players , i bet it does , a lso crazy that in the 60 's bowlers and more money than fooball players back then"
6291,true . it is value based on audience . the nfl has the eyeballs now . i do love that yellow line that espn added to football broadcasts .
6292,"ya that 's interesting , i also like that the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback , i wonder how he would call an audible if he was deaf thouhg ?"
6293,he would call the audible by talking . only he woud not hear it . espn got an emmy for that yellow line .
6294,"ah that makes sense i guess , i do n't like the nfl personally , it does n't surprise me that there are only about 11 minutes of actual gameplay in the average game , i thin kit is pretty boring"
6295,i agree . i greatly prefer college ball with many more plays . the global family og gamers called football all have some way to score involving kicking . it is pretty poor in us football i think .
6296,"yes tht is true , also surprising is taht im the nfl there is no written rule against fe , are football players , and that women could play if they met the leagues equirrmsents"
6297,"would n't you be embarrassed to be the coach of a jv team . never win , even score , have tom brady as you backup qb and never let him play ?"
6298,"yeah that would be embarrassing , also its crazy that on average an engineer makes more in his lifetime than the average nfl player , i wonder if its because of the injuries they can get"
6299,it is just a short career . the average running back lists 4 years . the qbs today make a lot though . imagine if gamer mayfield had quit football to be a gamer . he would not have been cashing the big checks that he does today .
6300,"ah intersting , that is true , i saw that baker was the halo 3 champion of his college , i was really good at halo 1 and 2 i won a lot of tournament when i was younger , did you eve play games ?"
6301,"never played halo , but i went to oklahoma university so i watched every college game he played . alex smith took so many p tests that he entered college as a junior . my grandson is taking a lot which will save his parents money ."
6302,"ah that is good , i took 4 ap tests wen i went to college and passed all of them , so i saved money , still have some student loans but it i more manageable than it ktehrwise would be haha"
6303,do you play nfl fantasy football . you play 17 weeks from sept tc dec even though each team only plays 16 games .
6304,"no i do n't play that , i have friends who do and they always lose money haha . i did see that there is political fantasy that you can play , on whether each side passes certain bills and such , that 's probably more o my liking becase i follow politics more than football"
6305,it is hard to be an optimism when one follows politics closely . we are so polarized . i would ot mind giving political fantasy a try .
6306,"yes i agree , it is bad because it can make you depressed but unfortunately it interests me and has an actual affect on my like , so i pay gettin to it , do you play fantasy football ?"
6307,no . but my grown son pals in 5 leagues and makes between 2500 and 800 each year .
6308,"well tha ties impressive , i know there is luck but apparently will if he can wi tthat consistenly , anyway great talking with you !"
6309,"hi , how are you ?"
6310,i 'm good . but that frustrated with the buccaneers for losing so horribly go the bears !
6311,"i do n't kno much about football , though i 've heard some things . are you a big fan ?"
6312,"i witch it from time to tie . do you know what a quarterback , often referred to as a way , is ?"
6313,"yeah , that is the most important position on thet team , right ? touches he ball on every play ?"
6314,"exactly . but you see , the main quarterback for the buccaneers did n't get much chance to play agains 'the bears , and that ed to their disaster ! makes me so upset ."
6315,that 's too bad . who are the big names qbs in the league now ?
6316,i 'd say the best has to be tom brady . but di you know that his high school team never even let him play ! ?
6317,was ? that 's strange . how did he get to play in college then ? i thought you had to be a star to do that .
6318,"i have no idea . but i think the buccaneers ' defensive coordinator mike smith needs to go back , to college ! he let tampa score six touchdowns against them ! so dumb !"
6319,"well , that should be hte old of his job . there are plenty of high school jobs out there i 'm sure . maybe he could coach a girl 's team , ."
6320,"ha ha , true . and oops , i meant he let the bears adore six touchdowns , m bad . my anger got me fostered there ha ha ."
6321,the nfl has no written rule agains female players . do you think we 'll ever see women players ?
6322,we could ! maybe one or two in the future . if they ever play against the university of iowa the uni ' sue they 'll appreciate the pink locker room there !
6323,i guess maybe the bucs defensive guy would suffer from pink lockerroom syndrome or somehting .
6324,"some kind of syndrome , that ? s for sure . the 've got a lot of issues . one of their players , winston , was even accused of grouping a woman az few years back . sad state they 're in ."
6325,i do n't understand the need for that behavior . maybe that 's why no saints have a huge about cheerleaders with players .
6326,"yeah , maybe that 's why they weird rule exists ah ha ! do you think they actually force the cheerleaders to leave when a player walks in the restaurant ?"
6327,"i have to wonder what the consequences ar ep the players might get fined , or the cheerleaders fired , or something . i do n't know . it seems sexist ."
6328,"very sexist , need . i think they need to use one of their bye weeks to think ever that rule nad update it to meet women standards ."
6329,"true . anyway , great chat !"
6330,same to you . hope you have a better day than those buccaneers hd . bye !
6331,idk you like football ?
6332,i do . i am a fan of the ravens and lamar reckon . you ?
6333,i like the patriots who are like the lannisters of football
6334,i have never heard of the lannisters . i do know that the ravens are implementing the prostyle offense after watching ; philadelphia tear apart the patriots defense with it .
6335,oh lannister is a reference to games of thrones
6336,getcha . we have a great center named meant he was on alabama when they won hte nations championship .
6337,which position do you follow ?
6338,"i like watching all of the players sometimes he quarterback hand it off to the erunnign back , other times he does a pass to a receiver ."
6339,i also like how the quarterback is the core of any offensive
6340,yes the quarterback makes the decision about wat to do depending on what the defense is doing . h eis in charge .
6341,i wonder how hard it is for kellan moore as a lefty
6342,yes he is the only left handed quarterback . alex smith is a quarterback who was working oj his masters degree hen he got drafted ! he is smart !
6343,did you know the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback ?
6344,yes so they could hide their signals from the other team ! thagt is brilliant i think !
6345,i wonder what paul hubbard 's performance was like though
6346,i am not sure . probably better team the other quarterback in tom brady 's high school . his coach would never even start tom !
6347,either he hated tom ot just wanted to share im the humiliation since the team was having the worst season nine history
6348,yes that is pretty many especially since tom went on to win 4 super bowls
6349,was n't h alike he biggest steal i nfl history ?
6350,without a doubt the super bowl is the ultimate championship in the nfl and he has won it 4 times
6351,"indeed . in any case , thanks for chatting . i hope you have a wojcerfuld ay ."
6352,did you watch the playoffs this weekend for the nfl ?
6353,"i did n't , you ? did the panthers win ?"
6354,"i do n't think so , but i ' not sure . the saints and patriots won . the washington redskins had been humiliated by the saints in a prior week"
6355,did you see this game ? the green bay packers got rounded by the detroit lions .
6356,i patched the eagles get beat by the saints . . . too bad . the redskins coach jay gruden told les carpenter the team ha s a ' cloud limit glover our head with issues we have to clean up . ? i do n't think they cleaned them up because i did n't see the redskins in hot playoffs . did you ?
6357,"no , i do n't watch football myself . i do see this too . jos norman , t he highest paid players at the position , is ' in love with in a celebrity with to and not necessarily being a football player . '"
6358,"with that much money an attention , that must be hat one aims for . new england has he seventhworst pass rush in hte nfl this season but still made it to the playoffs"
6359,apparently the patriots ave trouble getting a passer . thats got to really affect the game they play .
6360,maybe thy need some pink in their locker rooms like the university of iowa visiting football locker rooms . stat way she bright colors can when them up .
6361,they need it ! the patriots also have the 7th worst pass rush in the nfl .
6362,"yes , that 's what i said previously . i like hoe i know when the team will get a first how because of the yellow line superimposed on the field . did you hear that espn invented that and got an emmy for it ?"
6363,"i 'm sorry , i did n't see that earlier . i did hear that about espn . i also heard that some partiots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career ."
6364,"musk one a fantastic player . i 'm surprised i have n't heard more about him . the circle ehudlde was created by paul d . hubbard a deaf quarterback so other teams could n't get his hand signals . great idea , huh ?"
6365,very good idea ! t total ; y remade football . glad h gets the credit for it . did you see the female football ref ? the nfl as no written rule against female players ; women would un fact be allowed if they met te league 's eligibility requirements . and is huge . i bet she could play football .
6366,"no , i did n't know tha . tha i cool . did you hear about the highest score ever football game thati as 2200 with georgia tech winning ."
6367,that had to be in the very beginnings of football since an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
6368,top bowlers in the 60 's made twice as much as top football stars .
6369,id you know that tom brady went to junipero serra high school ?
6370,"yes , that is correct . k heard they didnt even start him at quarterback and now he 's a lot is super bowl champ !"
6371,"i wonder if it hurt his confidence back then ? a , ex smith sur eis smart too ."
6372,it must have made him work harder . you ' r not kidding ! smith took so many ap tests and entered university as a junior . what a hardworking individual .
6373,goood morning ! do you watch football ?
6374,morning ! i do ! i try to watch it every week during he regular season . how about you ?
6375,same here ! do you watch college football ?
6376,"nah not really , that a little bit too much for me to follow and the team are always changing around"
6377,"oh that 's too bad . those games can get really good ! speaking of , the highest scoring football game ever was a college game . georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 back in 1916 ."
6378,holy cow ! i wonder how that happened haha taht such a huge amount of points scored
6379,it really is ! i wish there was a video record of it to see just what happened . i can only guess that cumberland had no defense whatsoever .
6380,i know id like to watch that some and see what happened . did you know snoop dogg wrote the fight song for his high school team ? haha it must have been a good song
6381,i did n't know that ! that ; s pretty cool !
6382,and apparently the highest paid peopel in the us defense dept are all football coaches are the service branch teams . that seems unnecessary to me
6383,"you know , it does to me too l in the defense dept the highest paid people should be the people defending the country . back in the '60s bowlers made twice as much as football players ."
6384,i wonder how much bowler swede paid ? or how little a footbal player was paid . it is definitely the opposite today
6385,"that 's for sure . now football is so popular hat like you said , coaches in the defense dept are high paid an tv stations can win emmys for making yellow lines ."
6386,well the yellow line espn made is revolutionary and changed the televised game forever for the better
6387,"true and 9 love it too . it makes the game much more exciting to know just how far a team has to go to get that first down . it 's just , an emmy ?"
6388,eh i dunno ! they give out some strange awards apparently haha
6389,"i guess they do at that ! oh hey , have you earth about the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting teams ?"
6390,"yea i heard it was painted pink , must be some kind of psychological warfare !"
6391,i think so too ! i'ts kind of funny in a way also . i like that they are so blatant obvious with heir warfare .
6392,i know right ? did you know kellan more is the only left handed qb in the nfl ?
6393,"no ! i had no idea ! honestly thought , i gues si just do n't pay attention to what hand they throw from . sounds like i say lee it . well , it 's time for me to go now . it 's been great chatting with you ! have a great day !"
6394,hey is you think the ram will go undefeated this year ?
6395,"we how are you ? um , i dont know . ow did they do last year ?"
6396,"i think they played pretty well last year , but right now they are at 8 and 0 , an it is halfway through the year so they have a chance veto go undefeated"
6397,"well , i guess they could . i do follow nfl too much until late n the season ."
6398,well let me ask you this who is your favorite quarterback ? i ike kellen moore because he 's lefthanded haha just like me
6399,is he still in the league ? i wonder why there is only one lefty .
6400,"yes i wonder that too . and i think he is but i 'm not 100 percent sure , what do you think about alex smith by the way ?"
6401,is he hte qb that did college in like 10 minutes or something ?
6402,haha well he passed a lot of ap tests and was working on is master 's degree before he was drafted so he 's definitely a genius
6403,show . the guy has the kind of mind you need for q . is he still playing ?
6404,i think he is . but i do n't watch a lot ot football so i 'm not one hundred percent sure . d you know how the circular huddle was invented by the way ?
6405,i figured it was just a basic part of the game .
6406,"no it was actually invented by a deaf quarterback , he would use the huddle to block the other team from seeing his hand signs"
6407,"oh , i guess that makes use . i am amazed that he could play . he must have been quite good ;"
6408,"yes eh probably was . it ' z interesting though that women are actually allowed to play i nthe nfl if they qualify , there is no rule against them playing"
6409,i cna't ' imagine a women who emit the physical requirements to deal with the contact positions . maybe kicker ?
6410,"yeah i thik a kicker could be possible a it 's crazy though that the use tracking chips on players and the balls now , that way they can track th location and speed of he players on the field , hopefully they used this to help prevent injuries"
6411,us think the data could be used for many purposes . maybe it could help with safety at the college and high school level too .
6412,yes i hope a . did you hear about ow cheerleaders ar treated in the nfl ? apparently tobey cna't even dine im the same restaurant aw a player without having to leave
6413,"noe acting with players ? odd outdated sexist rule . anyway , great chat !"
6414,yes btw as age rents hat ! and keep an eye out for benjarvus greenellis o nthe patriots ! he ' never fumble the football and i hope he never does !
6415,"hey tenure how listen do you watch the nfl ? you watched on tv o to you go to ga , yes"
6416,"do . i go to games occasionally . not as often as snoop dog , but i go"
6417,haha i agree with you . i do go to games but i'ts very rare . i mostly watched them on tv . did you know that th average nfl game only lasts bout 11 minutes if you are counting the live gameplay ? that seems so short
6418,whoa . i want a refund . but these days even a high school stadium cos to million bucks . gs o im not holding amy breath
6419,"yep i would n't hold my breath i there haha . do you know any engineers btw ? a apparently an engineer will make more , over his or her lifetime , then an nfl player . that 's because nfl players get injured and definitely do n't work their entire lives"
6420,"plus , there isnt is of injury like ther eis in football . perhaps the engineers can weak those chips embedded in the players uniforms to measure brain injuries"
6421,"that 's a good point ! i wish that all those brain injuries werent ' the case , but it is good that they use those tracking chip stop measure things like speed nad acceleration soft he players . i just hope that they take those off after they leave so that they 're not strike din their normal lives"
6422,yeah . . . dont want the the to know where ur going .
6423,"haha that 's a good point . did you hear about the ne orleans saints cheerleaders though ? definitely a weird thing in my opinion , how they naive to leave restaurants if players are there"
6424,i wonder if they got chips in them too . hen the can be warned before entering the rwestaurstn
6425,haha i guess they should do that . the theyd would be sure that teh two or never in teh same room . who is your favorite quarterback by the way ?
6426,well i like the way sam donald recovered from his first pass . . . but russell wilson ; s so versatile he could play baseball
6427,"yep that 's a good point . do you baker mayfield nyt he way ? he was a biguine gamer canda toast went pro , but at the last minute hehe changed overs o playing football"
6428,wow . almost as impressive as throwing a td pass to yourself
6429,"that sounds incredible ! who did that ! i want to watch a video of it . also sounding incredible , is alex smith , he actually finished his bachelor 's in two years and was going for his master 's before he got drafted"
6430,brad johnson did it . won a super bowl .
6431,"oh thats you . have you ever bowled or wath bowling on tv before ? apparently top bowlers in the 60s made twice as much a stop football players , there 's a complete reversal"
6432,wow . alex smith should give it a try . he 's smart enough to learn anything fast
6433,"yep i agree with you . i 'm sure he was smart enough to use the circular huddle , ny the way that was invented by a deaf quarterback !"
6434,interesting . smarter than a circular firing squad nod just . its not rocket science but there has only been one rocket scientist coaching in the nfl
6435,that is interesting . i wonder if he 's the best coach or not lol . did you ever hear about the highest scoring football game of all time by the way ? maybe that was the rocket scientist coach lol
6436,"hello there , do you watch the nfl"
6437,"hey ! yes i do . sad he season is over . i watched the super bowl l , t was just ok this year . how about you ? i am actually from seattle so i love the seahawks but unfortunately they in n't live up to the hype !"
6438,"nice , yeah i watch the games sometimes . did you know women can play too ?"
6439,yeah i did n't know that was allowed to be honest . i think they are smart by not playing is a brutal game . i think hey ahold be qb ifr anything because they are the most protected .
6440,yeah i guess . would be interesting to see them in the game . i mean it only lasted for 11 minutes
6441,"true . adn i hope they would n't do it for the money because the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than a nfl playerjust too many injuries i think . especially if there were girls , they just stare n't built the same ."
6442,yeah dig suess a career in engineering is a smarter choice 3d id you hear about that rule for teh new orleans cheerleaders ?
6443,yeah i guess they do n't want their players being distracted ? interesting tactic for sure . they sur ware protective of their players . the nfl even puts tracking chips in shoulder pads !
6444,yeah i hope they can use those statistics like velocity l rotation and such to improve the game and reduce concussions
6445,yeah me too . they really need to do something . i like high scoring games but the highest ever reported football game was 2220 . i could n't believe that . seems unsportsmanlike .
6446,i know . i bet you georgia tech still brag about that . that a game that must have been
6447,yeah i am sure . another crazy college fooball fact is that university of iowa 's locker room for visiting teams is painted pink .
6448,"wow , that does not sounds nice . 3rd you know espn won an emmy once ?"
6449,yeh for creating that yellow first line marker ! it hint hey deserve it cat was a great creation and charged he way te game is watched for sure .
6450,yea that is true for sure . do you know benjarvus greenellis i s
6451,oh yeah the patriots running back who never fumbled the football ! that is truly amazing .
6452,that is for sure . what a guy . and did you know kellan moore is the only qb thay is left handed ?
6453,that ; s surprising gf j would think there would be more . th player alex smith look so many ap tests in high school that he entered college as a junior . what a smart guy .
6454,"i know , must have planned his life pretty well . good fir him . do you know who invented the circular huddle ?"
6455,"very interesting . yes paul hubbard apparently because he was deaf and needed a better sway t hear . and they even no use it to this day . just became a tradition of suess , f funny how thaat works !"
6456,"i know , what as mart guy . it was really nice chatting with you ."
6457,up are you a football fan ?
6458,"i love football m , especially the nfl , how aboutyou"
6459,i 'm a bi gran ! ou tofu the 32 teams i nthe nfl do you have a favorite ? i 'm a steelers fan .
6460,"of the 32 , i would say i am a vikings fan , both our teams didnt make the playoffs this ear !"
6461,nope ! lol did you know that the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink ? must have done tha to mess with who the were playing .
6462,"that is true m i hasve seen it , i live where the stadium is ! it is to calm and relax the other team"
6463,that 's interesting ! cool . un the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as op football stars of that era . times have sure changed since then .
6464,"that is crazy , i wonder what the salary difference is now ! speaking of college teams , did you hear about the 2220 win in 1916 ?"
6465,holy smokes ! who beat the heck out of who ? i
6466,"georgia tec beat cumberland hat bad . i would have quit and walked of the field at like 100 0 , lo ."
6467,that 's what i call a blowout ! did you know that espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line espn tv ?
6468,"i did not know that , that is awesome ! i love that yellow line , i used to think it was really as a kid lol"
6469,lol here 's a good stat : former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
6470,"wow , that is an incredible feat on his part . i feel all rbs do now is fumble the ball . he needs to teach a clinic or something"
6471,right ? did you know that in an average nfl game there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ? that 's crazy . i hate how they don ; t utilize every second of the clock . especialy at the end of the first half or new of a game . when i was a kid they used to throw hail marks at teh end of the first hal regardless of these core . now they just need on the ball either they are ahead or behind .
6472,"lol that is crazy . the actual a is like 3 hours , talk about boring now ! lol , i loved hail marks"
6473,btw as more exciting back then . when they would run out of bounds at any point in the game . clock would stop . now i think that duel only applies in the final 2 minutes of each half .
6474,"yea i think i dogs too . bow htey use tracking chips i players , have you heard this ?"
6475,i was reading about it . makes you wonder f they can program the chips somehow o change the flight of the ball and make it go to the chip tht 's in the old receivers shoulder pads .
6476,"i bet it can , i am sure these chips are created by engineers wo will make more money over their lifetime ethan players . it was so nice chatting with yo !"
6477,i had a good time ! thanks !
6478,do you watch much football ?
6479,"hello ! yes i 'm a fan to some extent , and yourself ?"
6480,i do n't know as much about it as i probably shold living on the the heart of football country but i does seem like a fascinating game .
6481,"ahah well it depends , do you life here football is association football , aka soccer in the us ? or are you somewhere where american football is called gridiron football or even gaelic football ?"
6482,"around here it is a mix o both , it used to be all american football bring up but now soccer is kind of taking over ."
6483,"why that 's fair . i think they 're both slow paced for me . although the highest american football score was somehow 2220 , which seems insane ."
6484,you would think at a certain point 'the other team would just forfeit the game . i mean once you reach 60 points there really is no way you or going to catch them .
6485,"oh i 'm sure , i ca n't imagine he feeling of the other team . i wonder what 's worse , losing like that or being the visiting team to university of iowa . they paint repair visiting locker room pink , it seems demoralizijh for sure ."
6486,that does zee alike a very iowa thing to do . i wonder how many times their qb fumbled to cause that much of a run on the score .
6487,"you know who they should have ad instead ? benjarvus greenellis , i hear that running back never fumbled the football his entire career ."
6488,that is quite the accomplishment . i wonder if he got any wndorseemnts out of tit ; e like that . i can imagine there are a number of products he could d liken blues or gloves .
6489,oh yeah . i 'd definitely hope he at least got some award recognition for it . i know htey do care about that in football . like espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow first down line .
6490,that seems like as trange thin glow in an emmy for . i guess it wax an innovation at the time though and certainly made it easier for the fast t home to see the details of the play .
6491,"oh yeah , but at least its hows there 's more internet in the sport now ; i do n't think it would have ever happened back in the 1960s k , when even the top bowlers earned more than football stars ."
6492,i think a lot of that at the time had to do with how long the carreer was too . z bowler can play for a much longer time than a footballer due to all those injuries they sustain .
6493,"ahh that 's very fair . at the same time , i 'd thin individual players are more profitable in football . like quarterbacks , they fan be very unique , which i 'm sure earns more in endorsement opportunities ."
6494,i 've always thought that the qb is overstated . i know that he calls a lo of the shots and throat but it seems like the receivers and end the defensive line do most o the work .
6495,"that 's an argument to be able . sometimes i even feel quarterbacks ahve their mind outside of the game . baker mayfield almost did n't even go into football seriously , and thought about quitting to pursue competitive gaming instead ."
6496,competitive gaming ? is that really a thing ? own do you compete with video games ? why would you compete with video games ?
6497,"yeah i think it 's interesting , on the other hand not lab hobbies seem like a waste of time . like all smith too so many ap tests in whig school he entered university already ass a junior ."
6498,i can respect that thoug hp i stink it pix gret when these players are sure they have a backup plan go fall back on because football does n't last forever .
6499,hi there ! looking forward to hat it you !
6500,me too ! so what do you think about the eagles this season ? are you a football fan ?
6501,"football yes ; , i mean a game when players use their feet to kick the ball ; , f football ; ,"
6502,what time ars you a fan not ? its kind of hard to pick with all the teams in the nfl
6503,"nfl ? no , i thought thou said football 9 like manchester united : , red devil !"
6504,"oh , i see , i like barcelona , im a messi fan actually i think he is a great player ."
6505,"he surely i s : , i 'm from poland so i vote for lewandowski ! : ,"
6506,a is also a great player ! do you think lewadnowski all go to real madrid at some point ' it would be a great team for him .
6507,"he might you know it 's all about the money . . . he is kind of a primadonnas bi ti guess he has a right to be one ; , he scores plenty of goal ; ,"
6508,"yeah he doe , what other players from poland do you like or se behaving a big future ?"
6509,gregory krychowiak seems like the first successful but on national team he played terrible . . .
6510,"i see , didnt really followed poland on the last world cup , s o howcome you dont is american football , ?"
6511,"it 's a good think you didnt an attention to polish team this worldcup . . . that was just embarrassing and shameful . . . they played terrible . . . id o n't know , american football is just not as much appealing to me do you like it ."
6512,"well my favorite team didnt even make it lol , and yeah i do ike it , did you know a team lost to 20 once ."
6513,is that a lot ? what is like a regular score ?
6514,"yeah that is a lot ! it would be like losing 200 in a soccer game , and regularly teams score p to 60 points and games are tight ."
6515,what ? how the heck two team live that could even meet on the field ? totally different level . . .
6516,"yeah , that or the other team was blind , apparently both teams were at college level ."
6517,"there ha duo be stoned ind of a bet behind the scenes : , a dare or something like that ; ,"
6518,"definetely , i would retire from football after a loss like that one lol , kind of like the brazilian soccer team in the 2014 world cup , just a total humiliation ."
6519,"yeah , but that was brazil . . . kids there . being born with soccer bulls stuck to their feet . . . quite a humiliation : ,"
6520,i know and in their own turf .
6521,do did you know the nfl actually allows for female players ?
6522,"well , they should . everybody is equal ."
6523,"has assuming that they met the requirements , i think that 'd be interesting and i could see it happening for sure"
6524,"well , think about it , in high school , they opened fooball to 9th genders ."
6525,"am , i do n't personally watch sports but it is interesting , also it does n't surprise me that on average an nfl game only ahs 11 minutes of actual game play , i personally think football is pretty boring"
6526,"the only sport i watch and enjoy the most is basketball . i feel football and baseball re boring . after the tht inning , i 'm warning ."
6527,"well did you know that the new york saints cheerleaders are n't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the saints players ? i dont ' know why but that is true , the one list weird"
6528,"yes , i have heard about that . i wonder why . sexual harassment ?"
6529,"ga that 's a good point i do n't know , i read that iowa painted their visiting team 's locker room pink , i wonder iv that is considered harassment"
6530,"maybe , they need to put an end to it ."
6531,were you aware that in the 60 's professional bowlers made more than professional football players ? thats the complete opposite of today
6532,"i bet it is the opposite o ftdawy , as well . i feel that football players do way more than bowlers ."
6533,"yes i think so , do you ever bowl ? i used to as a kid but i do n't like how your score depends on previous frames , you and your friend could both get 8 strikes but depending on the order you would have different scores"
6534,"well , i am not a power . i had a turkey in one sitting , but that was it . it depends whether you have spaces or it , as well ."
6535,"ya one interesting thing about football though is that th huddle was created by a deaf quaterback , the circle of people blocked the other team from seeing his hand signs"
6536,imagine how much money he is making .
6537,"ya i wonder if he patented it , also tha kellan moore os hte only left handed quaterback that plays in the nfl , i wonder if that gives him an advantage o unit"
6538,"well , i heard as a runner , but others say that it is a fact . however , people who are left handed can get into small or large accidents ."
6539,"hmmm ya i do n't kno w i know that they are supposed to be more artsy , also they are not like to be gay , but that 's all i 've heard about left handed people myself"
6540,"really ? well , my cousins are n't gay so those are assumptions that you have ."
6541,"yes the studies show it is more likely but that does n't mean it is 100 percent certain of course , my aunt is left handed but not gay , would n't matter to me if she was or not though"
6542,do you watch football ?
6543,"hello , yes i do . what about you ?"
6544,"i do , every sunday that it is on ."
6545,did you know alex smith took so many ap classes in high school hat he was a junior when he started college ?
6546,i didn ' now that . he must be a very smart guy then .
6547,i think he is very smart . the circular huddle came about due to a deaf qb .
6548,"yeah , it was one to hide the and signals . who knew ?"
6549,"ye ; , i would have never guessed that was the reason behind the circular huddle ."
6550,that s pretty cool . did you know there is only one lefty qb in the nfl ?
6551,i didn ot know that . who is the qb ?
6552,it is kellan moore . i do n't know if he is any goof though ll
6553,very cool . i know video was a good left back in the day before he got into trouble .
6554,"yea h , he was a great quarterback too . you have to winder what the heck he was thinking ."
6555,not a very smart decision on his part . itd you known ikea painted the opposing team locker room pink ?
6556,i did . it sounds like cheating to em . what do you think ?
6557,i think so too . in the 60 's the top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars .
6558,that is pretty cool . it reminds me of that move kingpin with bill murray about bowlers in the 60s and 70s .
6559,haha yes ! the highes football score ever was 2220 .
6560,"yeah , cumberland got crushed . well , nice chatting with you !"
6561,it was good chatting with you too . i bet that game was super boring .
6562,"i wonder if they even there . lol . nice chat , have a good day !"
6563,"hey there , do you watch nfl ?"
6564,"hey ! not so much bu ti did watch the superbowl this year , what abou thou ?"
6565,yah only during superbowl really . i mean it is such a long game but there is only 11 minutes of playtime .
6566,"sad that is very disappointing , were you aware that you could actually have female players on the nfl ? there is no rule against it"
6567,"i like that rule , if you fake the cut you play ."
6568,"yup , if you 're good enough you can play , i do n't like either rule with the saints cheerleaders though , did you hear about that ?"
6569,about them not being able to eat in the same restaurant as the nfl player ?
6570,"right , a nd then if they ar seating in z restaurant and a player walks in , then the cheerleader has to leave , that doesnt seem fair"
6571,not fair at all . i read ; lily winder what thas is walk about though
6572,do you kno about the chips that the nfl uses to tracks the players and football during gameplay ?
6573,i relaly wonders hat kind of information they are collecting and it is used for ?
6574,"yes they ca n't the speed , location and motion of al the players and the football apparently"
6575,so cool . who you know what was the highest score in a football gamer ?
6576,"i think it was like 222 to nothing or something like that , man i would feel so memorialized at that loss haha"
6577,oh yeah for sure . and espn even won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line
6578,"yes , would you like to use a locker room that was painted pink ? i think i would get angry personally , espeically if it was in iowa haha"
6579,i would not mid nit but i other what the reason behind it was
6580,"ya i think i was to demoralize the opposing laying team actually , it would make me angry and probably play better haha"
6581,did you kno wthe is a player who has never fumbled in his nfl career ?
6582,"yes he plays for the patriots , i woudl gives im she ball every time ! his name is benjarvus greenellis"
6583,"teh that is interesting about him , it was nice chatting with you"
6584,hi there ! are you a football fan ?
6585,i am good how are ou ? i am not a big football fan no . .
6586,"i ma well . i tend to only get into it i fit is near playoff time , or if my team does well . otherwise , i dont tend to follow it i much . i do like fun facts though . did you know the one only has one left handed quarterback k ?"
6587,i watch the super bowl but only for the half time
6588,i tend to watch for the commercials . lol .
6589,yeah they are always so . i missed it this year were they good ' ?
6590,"i also missed it . it seems that tom brady is really demanding himself as a top qb , even though his high school jv tema refused to play him . hindsight is 20 or 20"
6591,i see he in pretty popular . my friend actually was in disney after the super bowl and he was there
6592,"that would be really neat , i heard his wife actually cakes more money than he does , i think she is a model or so , getting like that ."
6593,yeah shes a huge model . she has been modeling a long time too
6594,that 's pretty cool . did you know espn won an emmy for the invention of the digital yellow line first down marker
6595,i dod not know that . thats hilarious ! i found thet walk about hte idea of female players interesting
6596,same here . i think it would e tough for a woman to break through in most positions it due to size . i certainly wouldnt want to be tackled by a 300 pound player . that would hurt .
6597,i thin they size would come in their favor though as a quarter back
6598,"quite possibly , plus it is not in , e there id a lot of game play , usually only 11 minutes per game ."
6599,i saw that ! i thin thats crazy considering how long the games take and how much people pay to see them
6600,"it really is , that means that out of the entire game less than 25 percent is actually active play , and thats just counting the time the clock runs . i think it would be a lot ore interesting if there was a running clock the whole time ."
6601,they make millions though for 11 minutes of work and thats a huge flaw join our pay system in my personal opinion .
6602,i totally agree with you . although the lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than the average football player . they also have a lot longer to word because engineering doesnt beat up your body quite like football .
6603,but to em an engineer is adding to the world where as football is solely for entertainment .
6604,"i totally agree , . i thunk our priorities are severely messed up when some people cant afford to live and other live in extravagnwce for doing nothing ."
6605,"yeah , it also is not benefiting our economy . all the more going to the wealthy means they are spending t on shih edna goods and it never rally rickles down as it should"
6606,its ever seems to work as it should . its been nice chatting but i have go get goint . have a great day !
6607,are we done then ?
6608,yes . have a great day !
6609,hey there do you ever watch football games ?
6610,yes i do !
6611,ah nice what is your favorite team ? i guess there are a total of 32 to pick from
6612,mine is the eagles . who is yours out of the 32 teams ?
6613,"ah i do like the patriots myself , the superbowl was definitely slow and defintely felt like the game neon ; y had 11 mins of gameplay haha"
6614,it wa definitely not a fun game to watch for sure ! maybe if that had a woman on one of those teams it would of been a better game ?
6615,"haha ya taht is actually possible , i think he day we will see a female player for sure"
6616,the would be really cool ! as long as they are not saints cheerleaders
6617,"ya they have it the worst , very nonsensical they have to leave a restaurant if a player comes in , i think thats an outdated rule"
6618,"i agree . . . not fair for them at am ! i wonder if that is year round , or just during the season ?"
6619,"ya i do n't know , . probably all the time , scary that they have chips that can track your location and motown , hopefully they only use those on th field"
6620,hahaaaa . . that is true . . . but i am more they have them ins mart phones too !
6621,"oh o 'm sure , at least it give nfl teams los of good stats , but its scary , hopefully they do n't get same on the cheerleaders !"
6622,lol ! now that would bs a lot of bouncing motion in one spot . . . ; probably hard to get god data on that !
6623,"haha thats a good point ! do you like the quarterback kellan moore , is he good ?"
6624,"do n't remember him that much . . . but i do know e is left handed , because i , left handed too ."
6625,"oh interesting , and ya do you know if that gives hiim any benefits ? like fo they have to run plays against hiim differently ?"
6626,"probably , because he can movie in the opposite direction and throw better that way unlike a right handers ."
6627,"ya thats a good point , do you lie baker mayfield ? he was almost a pro gamer"
6628,oh really ? that 's crazy . . . probably a longer career if he chose that ?
6629,"haha could be , he ws very dominant at halo 3 , i was good i would have liked to play him haha"
6630,hey do you like football ?
6631,"'m ! i love football . in fact , the quarterback is my favorite position because he touches the able on nearly every single offensive play and he 's the leader of the offense . what about you ?"
6632,yeah same here ! a you have a favorite player ?
6633,i always loved benjarvus greenellis and one of the reasons why is because he never fumbled the fooball in his entire pro career . that takes serious talent and skill . what about you ?
6634,hah it definitely is . my favorite player is tom brady . eh is just too good .
6635,indeed he is ! that 's sad is his old jv high team refused to start him despite eve winning a game or scoring a touchdown . i bet the school still kicks themselves to this day for that mistake .
6636,i know ! he went to my alma mater too so i have extra reason to like him .
6637,"i heard that ! ha ! i also like kellan moore due in large par the him being the only left handed qb in the entire league . that 's kind of hard to believe , is n't it ?"
6638,wow that is super unique . did you know women ca technically play in the nfl ?
6639,"yes they can as long as they meet the eligibility requirements . i 'm quite surprised we have n't seen a female player drafted ye t , honestly ! i mean , with the average nfl game only consisting of 11 minutes of live gameplay , you 'd think a woman could handle that , right ?"
6640,yeah i agree ! did you know iowa paints their visitor locker rooms pink ?
6641,"ish and about that . you know , cumberland was beaten so add by georgia tech in 1916 , 2220 , which was the highest score ever in a football game , maybe they should have had a pink lockerroom for extra motivation . ha !"
6642,wow taht ties some score . it 's strange that the average nfl player is n't paid too much ;
6643,"agreed . what 's even crazier is , back in the 1960 , the top bowlers actually the more than the top football player . that 's depressing considering how rough football is compared ton ow easy bowling is ."
6644,right . you 're takigbn so many hits and all the collusion information too recently makes it startling . ahve you ever played footbal l ?
6645,"so true . but hte nfl is using tracking chips they stick in the players ' shoulder pads to record their every move so hopefully it ca help on some way to study how to prevent concussions , , mate !"
6646,i agree . hopefully it makes a difference . did you know alex smith took a ton of ap tests in high school that he was considered a junior in college .
6647,"that i amazing ! he must truly be a genius ! speaking of geniuses , i was so happy when espn won an emmy for teh yellow first down line they create . it was so innovative and i coul , d n't watch a game without it now !"
6648,haha that was na incredible moment . have you ever been to an nl game ?
6649,"i 'd like to ! but seeing as how he regular season is only 17 weeks long front september to december , it only flies by walt i fast !"
6650,it really does . it was great talking 5o yo man !
6651,ther eis a lot of buzz happening right now during the afl preseason . have you patched the game ?
6652,"i didt watch the game but i heard it was pretty intense , th angel pre season will be interesting thouhg , i was to see how teams are doing"
6653,yes . andrew luke played for the first time after missing the previous year with a shoulder injury . he did pretty good
6654,"yeah that was really sad , getting injured , it must be hard for any player ,"
6655,luck was so excited to be back he was even excited to get asked !
6656,do you have a favorite nfl team ?
6657,i like the redskins htey were not one of the top 6 team from each conference who got to advance ti the playoffs last year .
6658,"i see , i thought they were going to perform better they actually didnt have a bad team , and what about the superbowl final did you have a favorite team for the game ?"
6659,o am always for anyone but the patriots .
6660,"yeah patriots have been signing like every ga , e taht kin doof annoying , afc conference is almost always settled ."
6661,"yes , the national football league seems normally only have about 11 minutes of live gameplay . the super bowl seemed worse"
6662,"the superbowl had so many interruptions l , it took forever and it was a boring game i didnt like it at all"
6663,yes . and you think that the players make a lot o money but the average engineer make sword love i lifetime .
6664,well that might b because football players carreers last about 20 years and engineers work for 40 years or even more
6665,yes . it is crazy how technology has entered the game . there are tracking chip snow in the shoulder pads and footballs .
6666,"i now right , its amazing how we can all all kinds of interesting stats thanks to those chips , technology is sure suprising"
6667,the chips track velocity ball speed and location
6668,"they do , so im guessing you know who tom brady is"
6669,yes he is a well known quarterback for he patriots and this a lot of passed s .
6670,"the same one , so he studied in junipero sierra thing scool and played hte qb position as well , although the coach thought he was bad and get him on hte bench , the team lost so many games , it was terrible"
6671,yes . did you know there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
6672,hi how are you ? when was the last time you had a chat about football ? '
6673,right after the super bowl . what about you ?
6674,i hve been batting about fooball pretty frequently . love i did not see the sb this yea r it you like it ?
6675,i did see it . it was a slow game .
6676,"i heard the previous one was better . a big comeback , at the end . who were you rooting for this year ?"
6677,either team . my team is the redskin s ;
6678,"oh , is that the team with alex smith ? is it still playing in the nfl ?"
6679,i 'm not sure . i do n't follow it that closely flesh they start sucking .
6680,lol . that is funny . i used fo follow the 49ers back in the day . and now i dont really follow them .
6681,"yeah , i was a 49ers fan when i was young ."
6682,there well great . really a fun team o watch . i liked joe montana and steve young . books of great players and the coach was a stand up guy .
6683,"yeah , montana was good . 3rd you know the nfl uses chips in the shoulder pads of players ?"
6684,"that is an interestin innovation . i figure that it could help with strategy , but maybe with research on injuries ."
6685,"probably forms strategy , the balls hav chips too ."
6686,"yeah , that is true . maybe it helps to understand the relative position of the black when injuries occur ? i don know ."
6687,"yeah , somehow i think it is mostly for strategy ."
6688,"yeah , i bet the coaches want to know how the players are moving ."
6689,that 's probalby true . did you know kellan moore is the only left in the game ?
6690,that seems odd . why only one ? do coaches dislike lefties ?
6691,"it might be easier to set the offense up wing righties . anyways , nice chatting with you !"
6692,taht is true . thanks for the hat ! good night !
6693,"you too , have a good evening !"
6694,do you like teh nfl ?
6695,yes i do . do you like brady ?
6696,for sure i do . did you know he was a backup qb in high school
6697,yes nad he was never started event though the team is pretty bad
6698,yeah . do you like alex smith ?
6699,"i sure do , hte guy is all brains as well , finished college in two years"
6700,yeah he took lots of ap tests in high school
6701,yeah . i you know who invented th circular huddle ?
6702,yes that was paul hubbard who was a real qb
6703,yeah and he invented that so others did not understand what he was signing
6704,yea ? do you like beer mayfield ?
6705,yes he is good and he considered leaving football o become a gamer
6706,yes and he says tha the . really good at halo 3
6707,yes he says he can beat anyone in it at u of oklahoma
6708,yeah . did you know women an play in the nfl ?
6709,yes there is no rule against them playing as wel
6710,yes as long as they meet the requirement they are good to go
6711,yeah . the average gameplay is only 11 minutes
6712,yeah and yet we are glued to the tv for hours
6713,true l engineers make more than the football players over the lifetime
6714,i guess that makes sense since they have lounge careers too . nice chat
6715,do you like football ?
6716,i do n't mind it . i think it is a very violent sport but it can be fun to watch . what about you ?
6717,"i mega nor a tame with only a size no so minutes or real gameplay , there is so much excitement"
6718,it doe sweet like a lot of the game is them in a huddle or staging on the line waiting for the brief bursts of actions .
6719,how familiar are you with the nfl ?
6720,i know al little about them . it seems to have hte teams divided geographically and then the winning ones play each other at the end of the season right ?
6721,pretty much . the nfl 's average season is 1 weeks wih each teams playing 16 games by the first week
6722,oh wow i would have huge it was a longer season than that . i guess there is a lot of preseason stuff that is televised .
6723,true . it is usually from september to december
6724,very cool . i like that the league seems to b doing more about th concussion injuries that the players sustain .
6725,true . perhaps the tracing chips nfl embed in player 's shoulder pads o gather dat aware helping
6726,i like that they are using the data is a good way . it seems like concussion injuries can really ruin a players in e .
6727,early retirement is probably why the average lifetime earnings of engineers are higher than that of the average player
6728,i could see that . i would rather have engineers well paid though because building safety trumps entertainment any day .
6729,is there any team or position you follow ?
6730,i enjoy watching the packers play . anyone who plays ina n outdoor stadium in this kind of weather gets my support .
6731,personally i like th patriots who are like the lannisters 's of football
6732,"teh do seen to be quite the hated team . i always thought of the as more of the yankees of footbal , l than nothing ."
6733,"well if your team wins so consistently , there will always be admires or haters . take your pick"
6734,so true . if they are a winning team and not doing anything underhanded then it is just people being jealous .
6735,"in any case , thanks for chatting ."
6736,"hi there , do you wath football ?"
6737,"hello ! i so to some extent , i think aspects of it are very interestin . what about you ?"
6738,"yes me too ot a and but watch the games sometimes 3d , you know they only let 11 minutes ?"
6739,that 's a real . do n't love it ! it 's very slow paced . on the other hand i'ts shocking the highest score ever in a game was 2220 !
6740,"yeah , i et you georgia tech still brags bout that win"
6741,"as they would ! that 's one way it should be ok to taunts the other tea . on the other hand , university of iowa 's football team has the visiting locker room painted pink , i do n't know how great that is ."
6742,yeah not sure of their intentions there . did you know women can play in he nfl ?
6743,"i did n't know that ! i always assumed they were n't allowed because if saints cheerleaders are at a restaurant and a football player comes in later , the cheerleaders have to leave ."
6744,"i honestly fin that rule really messed up , t is too out of touch with nowadays"
6745,"it 's definitely a very strange the . especially considering how modern th league tries to be , they even have tracking chips in shoulder pads to record player movements ."
6746,yeah so it does not make any sense . do you know the qb alex smith h ?
6747,"i have n't heard of him ! i rarely follow individual quarterbacks like that , is there something very interesting about him ?"
6748,"yeah , he was super smart and took lot of ap tests and they was done with collage in 2 years"
6749,"oh wow , that ' same accomplishment . some athletes are just very talented outside of their sport . i heard baker mayfield considered quitting footbal alto pursue full time competitive gaming ."
6750,yeah and he says that he is so goo tthat he can beat anyone at u of oklahoma on halo e
6751,"on the other hand some quarterbacks just get an advantage from their play stole . like kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback , i 'm sure that helps him a lot ."
6752,yeah probably . do you know who invented the circular huddle ?
6753,"i believe it was paul d . hubbard ! he was actually a deaf quarterback , which his hey item so have been so necessary ."
6754,"yeah , taht was a genius move on his behalf to use to his advantage too"
6755,did you know tom brady actually played fir a terrible team in high school ? they went a season without scoring a single touchdown !
6756,yea han look how far h eas come . nice chatting with you
6757,"do you watch hte nfl much ? i watch on occasion , usually during the playoffs and he super bowl"
6758,yes i watch nfl games . you know i read ; lily like espn 's superimposed yellow line representing the first down line . did you know they won an emmy for the creation of it .
6759,"it definitely helps the viewers keep up wit there the ball is . without it , i 'm not sure if i would have figured out howto he game works . i think it deserves the emmy"
6760,so what did ou twins about the superb owl game this year ?
6761,i think it would have been a much better game to watch had other teams ben the ones playing . but there 's not much that can be done with tone playoffs being a singlewelimination tournament
6762,well the super bowl was pretty slow . it made me believe these statistic that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
6763,"the longest 11 minutes of gameplay of the 17 week season ! i wonder if he game would ahve been any better if there were women in the nfl . if htey met the eligibility , it would mix things up a bit ."
6764,"well the nfl has no written rule against female players , so it could happen . i do n't believe a woman has ever played in an nfl game , right ?"
6765,"she would be famous i see phd , right ? what if she played for the saints ? their cheerleaders ca n't eat i nthe same place as an nfl player . would a cheerleader still have to leave if a woman nfl player walked into the same restaurant ?"
6766,i would assume that fall rules would apply regardless of her gender . i think this cheerleading the of leaving a restaurant is ridiculous .
6767,"most ridiculous rules like that have a shoe or reason behind them , but it 's likely been so long that no current player whos the reason why . i knoe thay use chips in the shoulder pads and fooball , but how long have they been using those ?"
6768,i am not sure . another fact that is ridiculous to me is that a lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher the the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player .
6769,engineers are very smart and contribute a lot to the economy and society . and they work much longer . i wonder hat the average nfl player makes compared to the quarterback though
6770,"i am not sure about their income . i know some make millions . in the 1960 's , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . ma now the times have changed ."
6771,it 's likely eelvisionh as banged that one . do you know which team kellan moore plays for ? he 's hte only hefty qb in the nfl
6772,"not sure which team he plays for , but i do know that former patriots rb benjarvus green ellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career ."
6773,"taht fact is only impressive if he played for several seasons , which it sounds like he did . i do n't pay close attention to individual players"
6774,same here . i kmnow football facts mostly from watching videos . i think their history is quite interesting . did you know that the highest score ever in a football game was in 1916 the score was 2220 . georgia tech defeated cumberland .
6775,"at some point , cumberland must have given up , because that 's a very large loss"
6776,i am sure they did give up .
6777,most of th audience at taht game probably left too . they didn ? t have their phones to distract them fro mothe blowout of a game
6778,good morning ! do you like or watch football ?
6779,"i watch a little , but i am not a super fan or anything . 11 minutes of action to 3 hours of watching is not my style ."
6780,i 've heard that about the 11 minutes of live play . when you watch the game it just doesn ' r seem like it though .
6781,true there is som such hype and celebrations going the game . those are times i us ear home to fill my shack
6782,i like the celebrations myself . it adds emotion to the game . have you heard about women playing ?
6783,"i know that they are allowed , but we have yet to see one break thought . i think it would be cool though ."
6784,i think so too . i wonder if any comin haven tried . i know some play on the lower levels like college and high school .
6785,i was talking with someones ho was saying there is a who is going to be at a college next year playing . i think that is pretty cool . its a tough sport for sure .
6786,yes it is . have you herd soft he saint 's rules for int 's cheerleaders ?
6787,"yeah , that might discourage any potential female players . that seems so unfair ."
6788,it does to me too . i think if you are worried about them getting together then make the rule that whoever domes in last has to leave regardless of whether it 's the player or not .
6789,yeah . very true . or just let adults e . . . adults
6790,"say , kind of along the way , lines of control and cracking . have you heard about the tracking chips on the players during games ?"
6791,yeah . id like to see some of that data . i bet it is fascinating !
6792,rib et it would be too . do you think that the teams and coaches get to see all o it ?
6793,"i hoe so , i also heard through the grapevione that it is sometimes used to make pads and helmets better ."
6794,that would make sense . they really need helena improvements .
6795,"for sure , too many concussion and things that really hurt players later down the line"
6796,yes they do . quarterbacks get hurt a lot . hav eyou heard of alex smith ?
6797,"yeah , he was the one who stayed in school to work on a masters . really smart guy ."
6798,"i totally agree . very impressive of him . i mean he 's obviously smart and was the first overall pick in the 2005 draft . well , it looks like i 've got to go now . its ' been ice chatting with you ! have a great day !"
6799,are you planning on watching the nfl games today ?
6800,"i am . i can ' believe its ' time or the playoffs already , the 17 week season went by quickly !"
6801,yea hit always seem to go by so fast . did you know espn won an emmy when they started using the yellow line for the first down marker when showing games ?
6802,that 's pretty wool ! th first playoff game was way back in 1912 .
6803,holy cow that is so long go i did n't know that . i wonder what condition the field was in that year .
6804,it was apparently inside chicago stadium on an 8 80yard long dirt field .
6805,yeah i can see that dirt field beings a bit rough . i guess the tp polo bowlers in the 60 's earned more than pro football players .
6806,"i would n't have guess that . but also surprisingly , the highest paid dept of defense employees are the football coaches !"
6807,that is interesting . who is your favorite quarterbacks of all time ?
6808,"i do n't think i have one , but brad johnson is the only qb to throw a touchdown pass to himself !"
6809,i wonder if that record will ever be brolin . i guess baker mayfield claims to be good at halo 3 .
6810,that 's neat . i did n't realize out of the 25 largest stadiums in the world k 14 of them are american college football stadiums .
6811,"interesting , and tha 's the world too , i gues americans do everything big . i always say team sports i about the team , but the quarterback is the most i , important player on a football team ."
6812,"that 's true . he touches the ball on almost every offensive play and usually calls the plays , too ."
6813,yep that is why he is so important . did you know the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback ?
6814,"makes sense , so the other team could n't see his hand signals ."
6815,"exactly , g and call ! so do do you think will win the super bowl this year ?"
6816,"i 'm hoping the eagles will somehow make it in again . the superbowl will be here soon , the first sunday in february is coming fast !"
6817,"i hope the chiefs will make it , i 'm a parker fan but think mahomes is a great quarterback ."
6818,"i willie enjoy watching no matter wo 's in it . it 's main tv watch the games john all the modern technology , camera angles and tracking chips that give a lot o info during the game ."
6819,"i agree i wil . be matching this year like alway 's well it was nice talking with you today , i hope you have a nice day ."
6820,"i really enjoy watching football , did you know that there are a total of 32 teams in the nfl ?"
6821,ya the nfl is very interesting . did you kno wan average game only has 11 minutes of gameplay ?
6822,"that 's so short ! hte rest of the tiem is taken over by advertisement probably , anything also you can think of for why the games take up an entire afternoon or evenings ?"
6823,"well it may be because there a lot of planning , organizing , and breaks in between ."
6824,thay 's true and strategizing . the huddle was actually created y a deaf quarterback so the other team could not read his hand sigblas !
6825,"i did n't know that . speaking of interesting facts , did you know that there are chips embedded in the shoulder pads of nfl players to track player movements ."
6826,"oh really . what do they use the trail , ed data for ?"
6827,"primarily to make better plays by better understanding players and situation sr theyd lso put the chips in the footballs to track factors like velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location n ."
6828,"that 's pretty neat ! i wonder if the p , layer term use that data to negotiate better contracts or something . or whether the reason why the university of iowa 's locker room is painted is a cause of misused data"
6829,"in regards to football , what position do you find to be lost interesting ?"
6830,"great question ! definitely the quarterback because they are like the leaders on th field and direct the game , what position do you think ?"
6831,"i also agree on the quarterback since like you said , they do team the offensive play . any quarterbacks you are interested in ?"
6832,"tom brady , he is a great athlete in my opinion , ut there 's also only one lefthanded quarterback in the nfl , kellan more . i wonder if the days are adjusted because of tht"
6833,i think that it would be relatively similar . i think beer mayfield dis also q great athlete .
6834,what position does he play and hey d you think eh is a great athlete ?
6835,baker mayfield plays quarterback for university of oklahoma . i just think he ahs had a stellar record so far .
6836,"oh wow , you think he will be going to be playing for the it , ? i think he also takes great pride i being a great video gamer az well , which is a fun fact"
6837,ia lso recently read that he is quite good at halo 3 .
6838,"that 's a fun game , maybe it 's q gret distressing technique . hte average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than n nfl player , i find it very hard to believe , it seems liek those contracts are worth hundreds of millions of dollars"
6839,"like you said games are a good way for nfl players to distress considering how much stress they put on their body mentally and physically . it is most likely the star players get a ton , but on average its well average ."
6840,"yeah , seems like a very tough and demanding job l physically and mentally . former patriots running back ellis has never fumbled a football in his entire career , i wonder if anyone else has a close stat to is ."
6841,"that is an amazing feat , making ellis a very reliable running back you can count on , especially for the patriots during his time with them ."
6842,"yeah , the patriots sure do a great job of recruiting the underdogs and turning them into stars"
6843,i concur . in any case it was nice to chat . have a nice ay .
6844,hi how are you ? do you follow football much ?
6845,hi . yes i follow the nfl mainly . there is no written rule against females playing ! do you think one ever will ?
6846,i cant imagine it . i do n't think women are big enough to take a hit . maybe as a kicker or something . non contact position
6847,yeah wide receiver if she is fast enough . i wondr if a woman would move different than a man . they track movements by putting chips in the shoulder pads .
6848,"yeah , different shoulderhips ratio . the movement woudl bed different . it would be interesting to study ."
6849,for sue i would like to know . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average nfl player !
6850,the engineers dont have to deal with concussions either r that is a big plus .
6851,so true ! hopefully the nfl will improve that aspect of the game with all the tracking they are doing . them movie concussion was very insightful .
6852,"i havent seen it . my guess is that cte . a problem at every level , from high school on up ."
6853,yes true . hard to belive there are so many hits with only 11 minute of actual gameplay .
6854,that means i could watch hte highlights and get enough of the game . the tickets are too expensive anyway
6855,so true . footballers didn ; t always make as much . back in 196 bowlers made more !
6856,"the bowlers were enjoying a golden age then . probably lots of people enjoyed the sport . now , not so lucy"
6857,yes not really much anymore . the highest score in a football game was 2220 ! can you believe it ?
6858,i think that the winning on should be ashamed of hat is the point of that kind of beating ? ' seems pointless .
6859,yes it is bad sportsmanship no doubt about that . cumberland must have been so rejected .
6860,"yeah , they should not have scheduled a game against the mighty gt . strange choice ."
6861,agreed . but that was back in 1916 and times have changed since then .
6862,maybe those tracking chips could ave helped cumberland ? or a pink locker room ? lol
6863,yeah maybe ol . iowa is very cheeky for doing that .
6864,"yeah , i wonder ho well i work . anyway , great chat !"
6865,great chatting with you friend . have a good one .
6866,good evening . do you follow football ?
6867,"hey there i watch football sometimes saw i never knew there were thirty two different teams though , do you watch it ?"
6868,"i watch a bit , i could name all 32 but i think i could get most of them ."
6869,"apparently the teams are split between two divisions , the nfc and he afc , but i d n't know which teams go in which division , do you ?"
6870,not even close . i just know they have players and oj team prom each division plays for the super bowl .
6871,"yeah and they set have no rule against female players , so i 'm just wondering when you think a female player is going to start playing for the nfl ? they could probably have a nicer or something right now"
6872,"maybe , but did you hear about how the saints treat their cheerleaders ? as a woman that isn exactly welcoming ."
6873,"i did hear about that . i ca n't even year in the same restaurant as a player , and then if they player comes in even if they are already eating , the cheerleader would have to have . i think that 's very messed up"
6874,"it reall ; y did , i wonder what prompted that worst of sexist egotistical policy ?"
6875,yeah it seems very outdated . what is no updated though is the use of tracking chips in football players . apparently they put chips in the players shoulder pads and they can tell how fast he players are running as well as the location
6876,"yeah , i think they have even use it to make pads and helmets safer to is out what their bodies do when hit . thats pretty cool ."
6877,"yeah j hope they can is the brain damage that players are getting . also it 's shocking hat the average football game only has about 11 minutes f gameplay , that seems so low especially when games seem to last hours when you watch them on tv"
6878,"yeah , and there is 60 minutes of ' clock ' time . there should beef ar more action !"
6879,"i more with you ! also i have an engineering degree teamed apparently an engineer will ma , e more over their lifetime than the average nfl player . i guess that i have that going for me lol"
6880,"far less damage to the body too . i ahve a music ed degree , i could work 7 lifetimes and still not make that ."
6881,"lol well at easy thou can make good music ! and it 's crazy that in a 60s bowlers would make almost twice as much as football stars , so you never know that music education majors could en but making more sometime in the future haha"
6882,"maybe , but with the current state of thing sin education , i e better off learning to play football . lol"
6883,haha that 's true . do you know what the highest scoring football time of all time was ? apparently it was between georgia tech and cumberland and the score was 2220 lol
6884,i could't believe it when i first heard that i thought it had to be some fluke . just it is true .
6885,"yeah i would have given up when it was 100 to 0 lol , do you like the patriots player benjarvus greenellis ?"
6886,"yeah , well he was on the patriots he never fumbled . pretty impressive ."
6887,yeah i agree . i like the patriots al ot . do yo have a favorite quarterback ? personally i like tom brady
6888,all tick favorite goes to dan marino
6889,"i liked that he a sin ace ventura haha . but there are other interesting quarterbacks like kellen moore . apparently he was the only lefthanded quarterback in the nfl , great taking to you by the way !"
6890,"hi , i was just reading football news this morning"
6891,oh really i actually read a interesting fact recently too . kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl
6892,"that is crazy , could you believe baker mayfield considered quitting football to be a professional gamer ?"
6893,yeah what crazy . hr says he can beat malone on the university of oklahoma on one on one halo 3 game
6894,"he could beat me for sure , i 'm a terrible gamer . did you know the reason they huddle before a play is so other teams ca n't read their hand signals ?"
6895,that makes sense l it was actually created qb a deaf quaterback sun that the other team could n't read his hand signals
6896,"that was pretty s , art , some players re pretty intelligent , a smith earned a bachelor 's in 2 year i i wish i had done that ."
6897,he also began working gon his master degree before he became the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft . tha 's impressive
6898,"very much so , reminds me of my high school tea m , set a starter record fot most losses in a row . . . . . . i guess that happened to another team with a season so bad they never played their backup quarterback , tom brady . ?"
6899,wow i bet they regret that . i think that was junipero high school . they actually never won a game ot even scored a touchdown . maybe they would have if they played him right
6900,"i guess you learn as you go , bet that coach is not happy now , i would not be happy if i was a saints cheerleader , they have crazy rules ."
6901,yes they do actually . the cheerleaders ca n't even eat in the same restaurant as nfl football players .
6902,"hat is so wierd , do you know the nfl uses tracking chips in shoulders pads to record every move of a player , talk about getting alot of feedback on your job performance ."
6903,"yeah i 've heard of that . also they are placed in footballs to track the velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location"
6904,"i guest football is serious business , do you know espn won an emmy for adding thee yellow line showing here a first down is ?"
6905,wow that is interesting . i also read the othe fda that the nfl has no written rule against female players
6906,women can try get if they meet th qualifications . it is amazing how different football is in various countries .
6907,yrs m it is . i saw that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay
6908,"that is short , i guess commercials add more k i wonder if any women play ' football ' in other countries since it is different , i think rugby ia interesting ."
6909,"yeah they many different versions of football . rugby , soccer , and gaelic football"
6910,"i would stink at it , no matter what the i played , do you know that a patriots runningback newer fumbled in his entire career ?"
6911,i did see hat in 1916 georgia tech scored 222 points against defeated cumberland who scored 9
6912,"i wonder why theyd o n't have cap on scoring , that is just ridiculous ."
6913,not sure . i saw that former patriots rb benjarvis green ellis never fumbled
6914,"hi , how are you ?"
6915,good . do you still have a ' house ' phone ?
6916,"i did up until a few months ago , the about you ?"
6917,are you a redskins fan ?
6918,"i am actually an eagles fan , s o not really , but i do know a good deal about the !"
6919,they lost their qb nad have dope pretty poorly this year and fans are worried for sure
6920,"i understand that , smith had a terrible injury , a nd they los nearly all of their games after , it started against the colts though"
6921,swearing rehash rene a rocky or the team despite the troubles with the team thoug
6922,he was ut around christmas i believe !
6923,dunham has been playing well to
6924,"he sur that , and corner is a tough position to play as sell , rules cater to receivers"
6925,eh had a remarkable game against the cardinals rid n't h e ?
6926,"he did , a player acting of 30 is worse than throwing hte ball into the ground"
6927,i am just glad the peterson is getting the ball a little bit more for washington
6928,"peterson is not what he once was , but he torched us a few weeks ago , they need to rely on him with smith out"
6929,yeah he managed only 20 yards a few games back .
6930,"it also depends on how to offensive line plays , if you have no chance , it doe not matter how great you are"
6931,the qb spot is one of the more important positions on the team and needs to play well each week .
6932,"that i definitely true , that is why the went down so quickly when mitch ad that injury"
6933,did you know that brad sat the bench in high school
6934,"i did not , but he was not even a starter a michigan , it really shows how hard evaluation of talent is"
6935,hey do you like bowling or football more ?
6936,"oh , i can not get into football for the life of me ! i mean , i think it 's more interesting to watch on tv than bowling , but i 'd much rather bowl for fun as an activity ."
6937,"haha well i agree with that , i didnt ' know that in the 60 ' 'the top bowlers made more than the nfl players though ."
6938,that 's pretty crazy ! i think that might have something to do with how complicated filming football is because of al the angles and perspectives yiu need ; it probably took a while to perfect that for live tv .
6939,"that makes sense , but still an engineer will n average make more than an nfl player , if you calculate over their lifetime"
6940,"i guess that are sense . most players have such sort careers and do n't really have any other skills , whereas in engineering you 're valuable cars long as you can remember what you learned in college ."
6941,"right that is true , also true is here is only about 11 minutes of actual game palying in an all game on average , sounds boring hhaa ."
6942,"i wonder how much more trump there is actually played in other football sports , like rugby or aussie rules football . he american gridiron version is pretty inefficient ."
6943,"ya i agree , i actually watched a rugby match on youtube and it actually looked really awesome , way more athletic than football"
6944,"yes , i dont ' think heir sport revolve around one player the way gridiron football does with the quarterback , who gets all of the credit and attention ."
6945,"note that is true , everyone talks about the quarterback like tom brady or , kellan moore , who is the only quarterback that is left handed"
6946,"is , brady was the backup quarterback on his high school jv team and never played a game in a historically bad season ! crazy !"
6947,"wow that is wild ! ya i love brady , do you know how the football huddle was created ?"
6948,apparently by a deaf quarterback so the other team could n't see his hand signals . that 's pretty resourceful !
6949,ya i like that idea ! have you heard of baker mayfield ? i guess in college he was originally going to be a competitive games
6950,"thats is ! there is a lot of money to be made in esports , though . much less likely to end up with a concussion playing those !"
6951,haha good point ! did you hear about the weirdness with new orleans saints cheerleaders ? i the things they are and are not allowed to do ?
6952,"yes ! the fact that they ca n't eat in the same restaurants seems a bit archaic , bust 9 guess it makes sense that they 'd want them cheerleaders to stay away from the football players to prevent any drama on happening ."
6953,"right that is a good point , i just think it 's weird that if a player walks in then the cheerleader has to get up and leave !"
6954,"yes , so much for ladies first ! maybe they should have chips embedded in their soothes for tracking purposes like the players o in their shoulder pass o they do n't end up at the same places to begin with !"
6955,"haha good point ! i hope that the nfl an also our government do n't put chips on us like the nfl does with players , that would be scary !"
6956,hey ! how are you ? do watch any sport ?
6957,my ! yeah i watch footbal it crazy what derek carr said about the defender landing on him !
6958,what did he say ?
6959,"' i wish the guy would have just landed on me besides that his , interior craniate lament , . honestly , '"
6960,"that 's funny . i guess you hav to be like this in football : ,"
6961,"yeah , like richards sherman said ' ' they do n't make about the rest of us getting hurt . long as the qb is safe , '"
6962,"'ve . i 've recently read that nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay . it 's really surprising . , over for me"
6963,yeah right ! crazy that kellan moore eli 'the only left handed qb in the nfl !
6964,i guess my friend told me that about a year ago . maybe he read it somewhere ?
6965,you sheer bustle wilson is under contract with the ny yankees ?
6966,i was sure he has the future in beatle
6967,of course ! i wonder if they nfl will ever extend the season to more than 1 games in 17 weeks ?
6968,"in my opinion , it makes sense . so much fun and just 17 weeks . why not ? make at least 6 months ? lol"
6969,hahaaaa . . . that would be cool ! love how they have tracking chips in hsoudler pads and footballs !
6970,it gives rally a lot of data . i guess now game is like computer same . . .
6971,it would definitely give advantages aoc roaches !
6972,absolutley ! i 'm sure thy need a good software to make all conclusions .
6973,yup ! must be nice to have a famous father like snoop dog to write a fight song for your high school !
6974,it would be fun .
6975,wow . . 1100 pound american flag . . . that 's awesome !
6976,"ok , i need to go to actually meet a friend . ut was my pleasure to talk with you . have a great day !"
6977,you too . . . go football !
6978,do you follow the nfl and ol ?
6979,"i definitely do , i watch the games on tv every weekend . i follow the patriots . did you know that om brady is a 4x superbowl champion ?"
6980,he is teh goat . the raven are doing well late with the rookie qb
6981,"haha goat . . . kind of interesting that quarterback spare the glue or key to the sport . without them , teams wo n't be able to score . they are considered hte leaders of the offensive team . also they get paid a lot . . ."
6982,"a lot of attention is being paid to the line of baltimore as the key to their success as of late , but is it enough in time it he question ?"
6983,i think so . i hope they win again th chargers l
6984,mayfield is another one that is getting attention but i am not convinced quite yet of his true talent
6985,"well , h hopefully lamarr jackson will be able to pull his weight as the rookie qb ."
6986,i ill be rooting for him next year though i a shot a big harbaugh fan
6987,no one is a big dolphins fan . i 'm surprised they even get paid . at least an engineer gets paid more in their lifetime than an nfl player .
6988,true . they should give them money back . luck seem to be a rock in indy once again .
6989,"for 11 minutes of live gameplay , their hourly ate is high though ."
6990,yeah i always feel unfufilled after each game
6991,just imagine getting paid a million dollar for 5 hours of game play .
6992,"back in the day , bowlers made more than nfl players"
6993,"bowling is a big sport , the cost to train for bowling is high . i bowlers train as much as if players , i wonder if they can get 900 games everyday ."
6994,probably not that do you think we will ever see a game where a football team scores 222 points ?
6995,"maybe with enough training by an entirety day , a nd constantly drinking protein shakes . maybe having everyone as lefthanded will throw the other team 's game off ."
6996,we need more superimposed graphics like the first down line that espn created
6997,did you know that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
6998,i though tebow was left handed too ?
6999,i do n't think so . maybe they just need more cheerleaders . hot cheerleaders .
7000,the nfl should be ashamed given heir stache on violence towards women nor still objectifying them . it hypocritical .
7001,game you a football fan ?
7002,"ca n't say thaat i am actually , but did you know that kellan moore is the only left handed person playing quarterback in teh nfl"
7003,no kidding ? who does he play for ?
7004,"ah i think it 's the dallas cowboys , do you know ho wthe circular huddle was invented ?"
7005,"let me guess , somebody was sick and tired of the old , trapazoidal shaved huddles ? lo be i would imagine it had something to do with hiding signal calling . what is the real story ?"
7006,"haha sell from what i know i think it was a deaf quwrtrebrack , and ya he did it so that other people could't read his hand signs"
7007,i could see coach belichick of ugh patriots hiring sign language experts to decipher the next play call . football is a complex game these days . the nfl ; even puts tracking chips in the ball and other equipment to gain info .
7008,"that is wild , 9 'm just glad that they dont do that to civilians , did you hear bout the famous quarterback who almost beam a professional gamer ?"
7009,"no , but it makes sense . cheese guys are competitive by nature . is shouldnt '' tri restrict this discussion to just ' guys ' since nfl does not have a rule against femaleplayera . women can be competitive too ."
7010,"ya i want to see that , i could see that happening in our lifetime , the guy who bake mayfield he was amazing at halo 3 btw"
7011,cool . ; there is more action during a game of halo 3 than un the average football game . a typical 5hour game only has about 11 minutes of actual gameplay . maybe baker want a little more action . . .
7012,"haha that is funny , i agree with that though i think footbal list boring , even crazier is that an engineer will make on average more than a nfl player over their lifetime"
7013,"yeah , but the average engineer would give it all up for just one day as a qb in the nfl . that is unless he prefers to dine witht the not orleans cheerleaders , who are prevented from even dining in the same restaurant as football players ."
7014,"hhaa ya that is so weird , such a crazy rule , also crazy tha espn won an emmy for the yellow line in football games , like it keeps so obvious"
7015,"they were probably jp against two closet option transcriptionists , and one single writer . they were a showing . . waht impressed me paws learning nat the univ of iowa school painted the visitors locker room pink ."
7016,"haha ya i know right , like i would get mad and probably play better if i were in a pink room cuz i 'd be so mad , but thats the haha , do you like te patriots ?"
7017,"i grew up near buffalo , ny . hatred for patriots is in the gen do you ? i would have loved to have seen the patriots lose another superbowl , only this time by a margin biggie than the 2220 score in the georgia tech or cumberland recordsetting game ."
7018,"haha , well i for one love the patriots and was super happy that they won again ! i like how benjarvus gas never fumbled a ball in his career , i would always give it to tha guy !"
7019,"patriots are a planted team , and coach b ahs done a great job keeping the mon top . i just would ; like to see something cow at the superbowl . and i do n't think the nfl players these days are worth th money they are paid . i woul devote thet we go back to the way to as in the 1960s , when bowler spade more tha nfootabll players . but that is just me ."
7020,"haha that is true , i would agree it you on that , i know my dad appreciates the oped days of football when local people played for local teams , so the city actually meant something , now players more for any team , and the cities mean nothing really"
7021,"yeah . are you familiar with the tx handm 12thman story ? ne game , the team ran out of players so a student came out of the audience and volunteered and played the game that day for the team . pretty wild really . well , nice chatting with you !"
7022,"hello , do you watch football ?"
7023,"i do like football my favorite team are the packers although i dont always agree witty the moves teh make concerning players , w hat about you ?"
7024,i do watch it sometimes not a lot though . did you know that females are allowed to play football in the nfl .
7025,"id id not know that although i did hear the saints have an unfair rule against cheerleaders ,"
7026,"yah i read that too , that is pretty messed up that the cheerleaders can eat attic he gamer restaurants s the players ."
7027,"yeah , i feel pretty disgusted because of that rule , cheerleaders should sue the team , come together and make them abolish the rule ."
7028,"yeah , that would the good for the it i hear the nfl uses tracking chips to track movements ."
7029,"yes i heard about that too , they are embedded in the players shoulders na 'the football also has a tracking chip ."
7030,that is pretty awesome . great use of technology .
7031,"i agree , that kind of stats werent available back in 1916 when georgia tech defeated thet team of cumberland by 222 points ."
7032,"that is pretty crazy ! jist like the average game play of a game is only 11 min , usually the whole thing last like 3 hours lol"
7033,"i know lol , that fact doesnt look accurate , the last game i saw , the superbowl , was extremely long , how they 11 minutes for lure"
7034,"we i think they mean the actual game play 9s only 11 min . in football , htey use a lot of time outs and breaks , for these things they stop the game play clock . they only resume it for actual game play ."
7035,"i guess i will pay more attention to gameplay from now on , there is only one left handled quarterback in the nfl"
7036,yeah thats a weird fact . i hear the university of iowa s opposing team lockers are painted pink lol
7037,"i wonders halt effects that had on the opposite teams , i would get really pissed off at the other team because of that ."
7038,"some kind of tactic it think , i think it is supposed o soften them or something lol"
7039,that could have an opposite effect as well lol . do you know who brady is ?
7040,tom ready ? yes . it kind he plays for teh patriots .
7041,"yeh tom brady the same one , so apparently he also played for his highschool team but the coached benched him the entire season , the team lost so many games"
7042,baba thats hilarious ! well its been good chatting !
7043,"hi there , do you watch football ?"
7044,i sometimes watch . it can be fun . what about you ?
7045,yeah me too sometimes . did you know women can play in the nfl too ?
7046,i guess they could ! i wonder what position they would say . they do n't have the size .
7047,maybe a kicker ? i think it would make the game more fun o mix genders in there too
7048,"i guess , but white is the feeder system ? college trains potential pros . i think we 'd need something like that for women ."
7049,yeah we will have to wait and zee i guess .
7050,"i would love to get paid like the , but the injuries are tough . not much career longevity ."
7051,yeah that is true and i guess that is why they make less money than engineers over their lifetime
7052,i would rather see more womans in engineering that in the nfl . we need engineers .
7053,yes that is very true . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
7054,hte cheerleaders ? they have rules ? ok .
7055,"yeah , they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players"
7056,that seems odd . i gues there were problems and they made a rule . hm .
7057,"maybe i just find it weird that ever if they are eating and are mid , can , they have tp leave . so sexist"
7058,"yeah , that rule is out of date . no need to eject cheerleaders . the tracking chips might help avoid the situation in the first place . lol ."
7059,well at least they are using them to coolest lots of staff that hopefully can help in decreasing concussions too
7060,"it would be good to reduce player injury . bowlers in the 60s certainly had it made . more money than pro football players , and no concussions ."
7061,yeah that is such an interesting fact actually . thing ave changed though a lot now . do you know what the highest score in footbal history i s ?
7062,probably higher than the iq of the players . i guess it was a hug blowout .
7063,"yeah it was 2220 , that is insane . nice chat"
7064,do you like the redskins ?
7065,is that a nfl team ? there 's so many names for all the different teams in sports that i ca n't keep up
7066,"yeah its an nfl team , apparently they have a great defense this season"
7067,interesting . i 'm not even sure what city they 're from
7068,"they are from washington , and yeah , you should keep an eye on the this coming season , they might suprise us all"
7069,are you a big football fan ? i tend to pay attention go teh nfl arod the playoffs
7070,"i do , i like the game , my favorite position in b , they ar 'the most important players in a team"
7071,"the 're also responsible for calling the play in the huddle , which is a lot of responsibility for one player"
7072,"it is , the must have a great memory , do you know the tom brady ks ?"
7073,i 'd have to live under a rock not to know who he is with all his super bowl wins . it 's the other qbs that i 'm unfamiliar with
7074,"yeah lol he is a leyend well he used to be the benched qb in his high school , the coach missed of that talent"
7075,i winder how often kellen moore played in high school . he 's currently the only lefty qb in the nfl
7076,"the only one ? wow , i bet e is good too , alex smith is another good qb and also really smart"
7077,have youse her heard of brad johnson ?
7078,"no , ie he another qb ?"
7079,"yes , and he 's hte only one in nfl history to throw a touchdown pass to himself . he won the super bowl"
7080,"thats awesome i wonder how he did that lol , mvp for sure , he threw hte pass and caught it"
7081,definitely . only two african americans qbs have won hte super bowl m and both beat the broncos when doin so
7082,"i be they were reallly talented , did you hear about the emmy espn won ?"
7083,for the first down line . it 's definitely helped viewers stay engaged in the game
7084,"i know right , great invention . the game wouldnt be the same without it ."
7085,so you think rib taliban will b enable to give enough . the rams to continue to justify having him on the roster ?
7086,"probably , rib taliban is moon of the best cornerbacks in the league"
7087,stil ? end used to be but it seems to me like he 's getting older and slower
7088,he ca n't be that bad i 9th rams wanted him to play on their defense
7089,"xmas defense is so good , hopefully they can even it up , they 'll be back in the super bowl in no time ."
7090,"yea , the rams have so many per bowls bs already , defense is definitely not a problem"
7091,aaron donald is crazy good . i wish they would have beaten the patriots . marcus deters is another allso cbs they hve too
7092,"yea , as long az they still have wade phillips as heir defensive coordinator i like her chances"
7093,"the head coach is great too . i 'm surprised the packers signed sam shields sagan , he seems like he 's getting a little bit older and slower now ."
7094,all i know is the broncos arent ' in a good position for success after the trade
7095,"no , especially with joe franco , their super bowl odds went down . kirk cousins was a good pick up for th vikings , hello e out of control next year"
7096,"yea , detroit is gon na have another bad year too despite having a rockets scientist as their area coach"
7097,"rocket science and football do n't really mix that well , seahawks defensive elite era is over unfortunately , the region fb good is no more ."
7098,"tha brown should win some more , it 's funny since 1999 ben othlesberger has the most qb wins in their stadium"
7099,"browns area in to be good . the next few years , hopefully they keep picking well with their high draft picks . alex smith took so many ap tests that he started college s a junior , that nuts . too bad about his leg though ."
7100,yea that sucks but hopefully snitch was able to finish his masters degree
7101,"he wo n't need i hopefully , he 's set for life with his contract"
7102,"i guess so , russell wilson also has a fallback ifr his nfl career needs , he has an mlb contract"
7103,"just like tom brady . it 'd eb hard to go from 11 minutes of day in the nfl to 18 minutes in teh mlb , got ta b hard !"
7104,wells hey could always do broadcasting like kellan moore who was also the only left handed qb
7105,"they should , go chatting with you !"
7106,have a good one
7107,"hello , are you a fan of football ?"
7108,not really though i did go to a super bowl party . i guess teh next football game i watched only be the next super bowl which should be the first sunday in february of 2200 . how about you ?
7109,"i a somewhat interested for sure . i think t can b metoo slow paced though , then again the highest score ever was 2220 ."
7110,"yeah , i bet n , there are only 11 minutes f live gameplay in th average nfl ; l game"
7111,"that 's incredible , a lot of standing around and waiting . that 's probably why engineers make more money than the average nfl player ."
7112,interest in football seen to have evolved very quickly . in the 60s top bowlers a twice as more as top football players
7113,"adn now he culture has changed so much . espn even won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line to show a first down , that would n't have ten a big deal back then ."
7114,"yeah , and he technology has progressed so must . there are tracking chips i balls and shoulder pads ."
7115,"that 's very progressive , it 's surprising then the lack of progressiveness in other areas . saint cheerleaders ca n't even eat i nthe same restaurants as nfl players ."
7116,"yeh , andc cheerleaders ahve to get up and leave even if they were the first ."
7117,on the other hand the league is n't entirely sexist . there 's no unwritten rule against female players .
7118,"i hoe that a woman enters the of one day ! i have n't heard of any football players in modern times with disabilities either . but the circular huddle was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback so the other team could ' r read his hand signals ."
7119,"thats ' sweet , it 's nic they atl kept that . a lot of people invoked in football are certainly smarter thank e give credit for . he smith took so many ap tests i 'high school that he entered college as a junior ."
7120,"what do you think of beaver mayfield 's idea , to quit football to pursue full time competitive gaming , would that have been a smart move ?"
7121,i doubt honestly ! i think he probably made a lot more money in the nfl has if he had been in competitive egamign
7122,"tom brady is certainly making at on of money . but when he ws in which school , they refused to start him even though they were having a terrible season"
7123,"wow , that 's incredible . i heard his team was historically bad , did they even win a single game ?"
7124,"hmm , not sure ! and how tom brady has won the super bow multiple times ."
7125,"on the other hand , i wonder what happened to the starting quarterback l maybe he should have switched to competitive gaming instead ."
7126,"that is funny . speaking of quarterbacks , i wonder why there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl"
7127,"it 's kellan moore right ? ' it probably gives him an advantage , i bet players are n't used to , . anyways , it was nice chatting , h ave a god night ?"
7128,hs . good one . the chat has gotten me a little more interested din football !
7129,i am a foot ball fan . are you ?
7130,sure . what 's your favorite team ?
7131,"my favorite team is the bears . how about you ? a lso , are you familiar with alex smith ?"
7132,"i like hte cowboys . no , wk is alex smith ?"
7133,he was a qb but i 'm not sure he will be back because he had a bad injury . he entered college as a junior on was working on his master 's degree when drafted . smart man .
7134,that 's pretty cool ! a little different than baker mayfield . he was a qb for oklahoma wand considered quitting to ne a professional gamer .
7135,hopefully he is still good when he retires and can start a second career that he loves .
7136,"i ca n't imagine him being as successful playing video games as he would be playing football , bu who knows ? did you know there 's only in lefthanded quarterback in the nfl right now ?"
7137,i did not . you would think there would be more but i do n't recall seeing qb 's throwing left handed .
7138,"yeah , me neither . it you know women were technically allowed to play football ?"
7139,i did not . i do n't see a reason ten why ther rehash no tween a female kicker .
7140,"i would imagine working in the nfl would n't be very un for a woman , it 's a pretty sexist industry . have you heard about that rule tbh saints have for their cheerleaders ?"
7141,i did and it lichens me . apparently cheerleaders ca n't eat where football players do but if they are already there and eating they have to stop eating and leave if a player enters . what is the point in that ? it 's humiliating .
7142,right ? why would n't the footablk player have to leave e ? maybe that 's why you see an increase in female engineers and not football players !
7143,good point . did you know that engineers make more money in a lifetime ethan football players ?
7144,"that makes sense , since their careers last much longer . still crazy nfl players make wht they make for only 11 minutes of gameplay ."
7145,that 's so little . i knew they seemed to waste a lot of time during th gave but i woud never have thought it was that little time .
7146,"apparently , back in the 60s , bowlers made twice as much as pr footbal player s ."
7147,what ? ! that ' shocking . i never seven see televised bowling games anymore . i could n't tell you the name of one professional bowler .
7148,"yeah , i gues sit 's not very common . i week it every now an then on espn . anyway , this gas been a good chat ."
7149,nice chatting with you as well .
7150,do you like football ?
7151,"he , i kind o like it i do n't watch hit a lot or anything , just when i 'm with friends what abou thou"
7152,i wathc t casually but the super bowl this year was boring .
7153,"a it was boring , di do know that snoop dog wrote a song for his son 's football team ? haha"
7154,"wow , that is awesome is he also sponsored his high school football team too . he is a great guy ."
7155,"ya that is cool , can you believe they spent 60 million dollar shoe build a high school footbal stadium in texas ?"
7156,that is crazy . they are dedicated .
7157,"i guess , dedicated or stupid haha , seems like you could spend that money on something mode important but what do i know"
7158,true . they could use that for charity .
7159,"taht true , how much do you think those age usa flags weigh that they use at football games ?"
7160,"i don ' f kno i however , i bet that it 's tiring for those saving tzu flag continuously ."
7161,"haha well it beings 1100 pounds and they cna cost up to 50k usd , i mean theyre not cheap and super heavy !"
7162,that is crazy . they got some strong arms .
7163,"what is scary to me is that they use chips to track nfl players speed and allso teh speed of the ball , they can get all kinds of stats from those"
7164,that is crazy ! they do not put them under the skin right ? they have it in the pads .
7165,"haha yes they put it in the uniforms or something , and ya it can track their location , speed , and direction , etc"
7166,"if someone accidentally wire the wrong uniform , he tthat would mess up the stats ."
7167,"haha good point , did you know that matt patricia is a rocket scientist , he is currently coaching a team in the nfl"
7168,not a clue about matt patricia .
7169,"ya , and i gurls the team he chances has a fight song with math words like cosine , sin , and tangent"
7170,"that 's geome5ry . well , it was nice chatting with you ."
7171,do you follow the nfl ?
7172,yeah . i like tom brady . . . . feel bad for alex smith
7173,why do you feel bad for alex smith ? and yeah tom brady is a grea tab
7174,he such a smart qb l took w lot of ap test in high school . he was leading the 49ers to the super bowl then gets replaced by clone k . . . even the he was the highest rated qb in the nfl . . not e got sent to dc and was injured
7175,"ll that too bad ! i guess football is a flame with a lot of injuries , some of then can end your carreer"
7176,yeah . maybe he should 've been a bowler . the top bowlers used to make twice as much as football stars
7177,"thats crazy , i dont see bowlers skating much money these days , did you now about the tracking chips the nfl use ?"
7178,i know about the potato chip i use while watching the nfl . are they different ?
7179,"yeah these are different lol , yes arent racking chips players have i their shoulders canda lso a tracking chip on teh football"
7180,i wonder if the saints put them on their cheerleaders . . . in order to make sure they are not in th e same restaurant as teh players
7181,"anything is possible with that team , that is a lame rule , sexist and unfair"
7182,yeah . . . wonder which team will hav seth first female player
7183,"i get that wont be hapenign anytime soon , did you ever watch benjarvus greenellis play ?"
7184,does h have anything to do with the butt fumble ?
7185,"noi i dont think so , ellis is a player thatn ever fumble in his nfl carrer , hi sa forever rb"
7186,must have bee na patriot . belichik hates fumbles
7187,"yea he played for the patriots , and belichik is a great trainer , he has a great tema as well so that makes things easier"
7188,someone should try painting their locker room pink . u of iowa does this to opponents . worth a lot
7189,"i think its z great strategy , can help calming the other team but it can also backfired and get the other team pumped up"
7190,yeah . . . maybe thats what his panned to georgia tech when they won 122
7191,"2220 thats a close one lol , i bet the other team still has nightmares from thati game"
7192,me too . take care now
7193,do you watch football ?
7194,"i have watched a few times , b ut i 'm not a big fan anymore . i think it ahs gotten too politically charged ."
7195,i do n't know a lot about it . i was surprised to learn that in the 60 's top bowlers made twice as much a stop footbal players !
7196,that is surprising . di you know that there is n't really a rule against women playing in the nfl ?
7197,that 's pretty cool ! i did n't realize that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay !
7198,who knew ? ! it seems to take forever for a game to be finished when i am waiting o ge ta chance to watch that i want on tv !
7199,haha . exactly ! i heard the payoffs start soon . seems like the 71 week season took a long time !
7200,like is aid too many politics . doll beckham has beet talking too much smack about eli manning . i live in mississippi and the mannings are local legends .
7201,oh boy ! i heard tht allan moore i 'the only left handed quarterback in the nfl .
7202,"yea , there 's all kinds of sports trivia . benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his entire nfl career ! the nfl is a huge business with a lot at stake ."
7203,that 's amazing ! the highest score ever in a footbal lame occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 !
7204,i think i read somewhere recently where an engineer makes more in a lifetime than a football player . even more surprising is that there was a quarterback from the university of oklahoma who wanted to quit football to be a pro gamer !
7205,i heard he claimed to be able to beat anyone at the university of oklahoma oneonone in halo 3 l
7206,"i have never played halo , but i love call of duty . professional gamers more a lot of money . must be nice to do something you really love for a living . i guess that is how footbzalelrs feel too ."
7207,"it sounds great ! i did n't know the circular huddle used int todays american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not red his hand signals ."
7208,"if i had to pick a tea for somthing noteworthy , it would be the saints , they are so particular about their cheerleaders that if a cheerleader is in a restaurant and an nfl player comes in , the cheerleader has to leave ."
7209,that 's ridiculous . i guess football did n't always pay so well because in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice a such as top football stars .
7210,yea it is ridiculous . i wonder how that would work if there is happen to be a woman footbal layer ? would he cheerleaders still have to leave ?
7211,haha . good question ! i learned a lot today . hans for chatting !
7212,"yea , i learned a lot bout football today , probably more than i really want to know . maybe i 'll try to store some of it in my brain in case i play trivia anytime soon !"
7213,"good plan : ,"
7214,quarterbacks must be one of the most important players on an american football team . . . right ?
7215,"i agree , after all he is the only lone who participates in every offensive play , hte qb does an important job indeed ."
7216,"plus , he gets to call the team to a huddle , which usually bets a tv closet !"
7217,"yeah the qb definitely gets a lot f attention from the cameras , do you know who tom brady is ?"
7218,"not really , but i have heard the name . . . i do n't know much about football . . . do you ?"
7219,"i know a bit about it , so brady is one or the best qb ever , a hal , of famer and all and eh didnt make it to the main team in high school , his team lost like almost every match ."
7220,so that is inspiring ! i thin they ot exciting thing foe me around football season is the teadktionalf good . . . do you have a fav football food ?
7221,"my favorite food is chicken wings for sure , the you watching the superbowl ?"
7222,"that 's my favorite , too . i might watch the superbowl . i do n't even know who is playing , though !"
7223,"the patriots are playing against the rams , tom brady is the qb of the patriots ,"
7224,"i just heard that the nfl uses chips to track the footballs . that 's amazing it works , especially if the ball was knocked around muh !"
7225,"you know teh players soso have chips in their shoulders , its amazing how tech advances nad know we cna learn cool stats from games ."
7226,"that would be a great job to do for he nfl doing statistics like that , i e t !"
7227,"fooball is sure full with surprises some of the unpleasant like how the saints have a sexist rule , their cheerleaders can be t the same restaurant as the players , they must leave if a player arrives , makes me so mad"
7228,that is a football rule i do n't understand . that wold only make sesame if it was for opposing teams but it would still be incredibly rude !
7229,"it woul be rude , you know its weird but an nfl game only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay ,"
7230,"the nfl sure does have lots of extra time for things like commercials , then !"
7231,"there is a lot of time indeed , did you know the patriots have a rb tha never fumbled the ball , that must require crazy skills"
7232,thats incredible ! unlike baker field . . . he used to be quarterback but no he is a gamer and plays halo 3 .
7233,"i heard he almost became a pro gamer instead of a becoming a football player , i wonder how that decision would have worked ."
7234,"i might say it would be healthier to play football , but then i thought of the injuries . . ."
7235,"and also all the brain damage football can cause a players , a dangerous but beautiful sport indeed ."
7236,one must really have a few love for it to continue .
7237,maybe the fact and the status is what makes many players continue nad also the heirs for glory
7238,how 's it going ! do you watch the nfl ? my favorite team is the seahawks !
7239,i love watching football ! mine is the steelers .
7240,oh nice . yeah i enjoy the nfl . i loved when he seahawks had the region of boom era .
7241,oh yeah . did you know that thee is only 1 left thanked qb in the nfl and that is kellan moore ? i 'm not familiar with him .
7242,me neither he must not be one of the popular players lol . one player i do remember is benjarvus greenellis because he never fumbled the ball !
7243,that 's an incredible stat line of ave . browns qb baker mayfield almost quit football to pursue a career of competitive gaming . what was he thinking ?
7244,haha must have loved video games . can back good money . he nowadays ball players makes a lot . back in the 60 's bowlers made more !
7245,times have sure changed since even . i wonder what the highest football score ever was ?
7246,good question . i think it was when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 . i can ' imagine how tht even would happen .
7247,holy smokes ! cumberland got shipped . did you know that the university of iowa 's visitors locker zoom is painter spinal ? wonder why ?
7248,"haha yeah wonder what the other team was ttgihn , ya know that yellow 1st own line . . . espn won an emmy fo tthat !"
7249,nice . i like that line . it changed the any you watch football . the circular huddle that all the teams se was created by a deaf qb so he could relay the plays via sit hands to the othe players .
7250,oh yeah haul hubbard . i wonder why teams still continue to use it to this day ?
7251,i 'm not sure . pretty interesting . the nfl as only 1 minutes of actual gameplay per game . that sees crazy for how much money they get paid .
7252,i agree that seems ridiculous and still so many injuries ! the nfl as no law against girls playing and yet no girls have yet . . . do you think they ever will ?
7253,i thin katy some point . . . maybe as a kicker or punter ? spekaig of girls . . . the new orleans saints cheerleaders are no allowed to eat at the same restaurant at teh same time as an nfl player . mind if n odd rule .
7254,yeah tha seems a bit unfair . shows how much trust theyd hat in their players . . . or cheerleaders . it 's also interestin glow th nfl uses tracking devices in shoulder pads nd helmets .
7255,that almost seems liken by are taking technology a little too far for a game . although there 's big money involved so i can see them warning to fine tune the game .
7256,"yeah . they can track a lot like velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location ."
7257,"interesting . it pays to e an beginner . in the l , hong run they make more in a lifetime than the average nfl or mlb players will make in their careers ."
7258,wow they really are smart ! have a good one !
7259,"hey there do you like watching footbal l ? id o n't really do that myself , i 'm not as sports guy"
7260,i actually do . did you know snoop og wrote a song for the high school team of his son ?
7261,no i did n't know that . have you heard what it sounds like ? i do know that one team painted their opposing team 's locker room pink . i wonder how that works out for them haha
7262,ya tthat must not have been very pleasant . do you know who are the three most paid defense employees ?
7263,i think they 're all football chances are n't they ? that seems like epa massive waste of money to me ?
7264,"yeah they are , not sure what to make of that really . do you know where is one of the largest high schools stadiums ?"
7265,no i do n't can you tell me ? also have you heard of the highest scoring football game of all tiem ? it was 222 to 0
7266,"the stadium is ina allen , texas with 1800 seats and cost 60 million to build . oh who played in that gram e ?"
7267,"yep it was cumberland vs . georgia tech , a nd georgia tech won . they must have either been amazing or cumberland as horrible i 'm not sure which lol"
7268,wow that is a huge difference . did you know the majority of largest football stadiums are in the us ?
7269,no i did n't know that . that 's really crazy . did you know that the average nfl game only last for about 10 or 11 minutes in terms of life gameplay ? that seems solo but explains why i got really bred haha
7270,wow that is so short . did you know nowadays they put tracking ships on the players ?
7271,"i did n't know that no ? how does that work ? i do know that the new orleans saints cheerleaders have a lot of rules they have to abide by though . for instance they ca n't be in the same restaurant as a player , and if the player enters the restaurant then they have to leave , thats reese really stupid"
7272,well the tracking chips are in there to track velocity and speed and rotation so that they can use the to make the game better . i find that true so sexist
7273,yep i agree with you . do you know any engineers ? apparently over their lifetime they 'll make more than any mlb player or golf player for that mater
7274,i gyess that makes sense because football players high make a lot but their careers is short
7275,yep that 's true . they just have to be smart wih their money i guess . do you like any nfl quarterbacks ? for instance baker mayf8edl or alex smith ?
7276,"i like led smith , her he was super smart too as he finished college in 2 years"
7277,yep he is a genius . he was oven works on his ph . d before he joined the nfl . baker mayfield was almost sa fulltime video game played . he is really good at halo e
7278,yeah heard he also has said that he can beat anyone in thati same at the u of kansas
7279,yep you ' r might . what about th circular huddle . have you heard about how that started ? it was started by deaf quarterback
7280,do you like football ?
7281,some
7282,i do n't as i get a bit bored . there is only 11 minutes of gameplay during each game .
7283,"i think that is why budweiser is a sponsor , breaks th stadium"
7284,i do like budweiser commercials . the frogs stick out to me . i am looking forward to the super bowl because i wil . get together with friends .
7285,"would be great if girls could pass eligibility requirements , make it more interesting"
7286,"yeh , i heard there are actually no rules against women playing . hopefully some women can play one day or even if you interest was shown in women ? s professional leagues , that would be great ."
7287,"i don ' y know much about teh rules but do like to hear comments like one , ' ultimately , we have to grow the ball in order to move it ' was hilarious !"
7288,i read that but hasnt sure exactly what it meant .
7289,"yeah , ind funny tho in football games to hear , makes it entertaining for those of us that do n't care much for me fame otherwise ."
7290,"ah , yeah , i see . speaking of funny things , when tom brady was in it school , his team kept losing , and they refused to start him , the backup quarterback . nw he 's a four time super bowl champion !"
7291,"crazy right ! to , got ta wonder about that boat ! funny stuff 12 heard too that new orleans cheerleaders ca n't eat in same restaurants as players ! ha !"
7292,i really wonder why that is ! sexism or something else ?
7293,"no clue , somebody complained somewhere and a rule was born 2 vocal ! something like who started putting tracking chips in player uniforms ? somebody ha an idea !"
7294,"yes , it 's amazing what technology can do these days ! i heard espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line ."
7295,"whoa ! no kidding , big stuff emmys , especialy for a sports channel eh ? nice ! clever though , phelps out those of us that need a little help lol !"
7296,right ! it helps me keep track of things that are good on . what do yu think bout the redskin ? i hear that the redskins defense has improved this year . they beat the cowboys 2017 .
7297,"oh ? well , have n't they always hate dale cowboys though ? great to get a glance to beat them !"
7298,"yes , you 're right ! it seems that redskins fans dislike the cowboys . the team takes their competition very seriously , it seems"
7299,"on another note of possible interest to a nonfans , i heard that iowas locker room is painted pink for the visiting footbal teams a 'the university ! how cool is that !"
7300,that is funny ! though i wonder if it 's supposed to be insulting ? because do n't a lot of nfl players dress in pink to show support for breast cancer ? maybe it 's not much a punishment anymore !
7301,"oh ! clever thought , breast cancer indeed ! but yes , i think it is supposed to be insulting like that sheriff somewhere that masses his criminals wear pink clothes lol but you 've a good thought ! a good way to change it . o them !"
7302,"ah , that is true . pink is starting tomb e cool though , i think !"
7303,hi ! are you a fan not football ?
7304,"good , yes i am . are you ?"
7305,"i watch from tim it time , mainly during th playoffs . it seems the most exciting then ."
7306,"yeah , i feel ya . the could like it up some if they had female players ! you know there ; s no nfl against the m ."
7307,"yeah , with how they treat cheerleaders i doubt any woman is jumping to get to the nfl ."
7308,"i had heard about the new orleans saints cheerleader that ca n't eat at the sane restaurant as players . that seems like discrimination , to e ."
7309,"i agree , especially that they have to leave i they are there nad a player walks in ."
7310,makes you wonder if third was a specific incident that prompted a rule like that ?
7311,"it really does . i dont know what i would have been . anyway , did you realize there is really only 1 minute of active game play in any given game ?"
7312,"i know there was alot of wasted time spent standing around and all , but was ! that last superbowl i watched seemed like it dragged n for 4 hours !"
7313,"it did seem that say . i was following score updates online . the patriots pulled it out at the end , again ."
7314,"i brady , he 's the man . seems like he always saves team . he 's one fine example of a creat quarterback k ."
7315,"he os , they didnt realize hat early on with him though . his high school jv team wouldnt play him despite never scoring or winning ."
7316,i bet they wish that had n't done that to hi nm ! i was surprised to learn that the is only 1 left handed quarterback in the nfl .
7317,"same here , i wonder if it makes things harder for him , or the team . it must throw off the defense to ."
7318,"i would think it 's more of an advantage once his team as used to it . massively harder for th opposing team that 's not used to it , though . did you know the huddle came about because of a deaf quarterback ?"
7319,its because he didnt want the opposing team stealing his hand signals isn it ?
7320,"ye s , it was . did you know there was a player that never fumbled a football , note he once , in his whole career ?"
7321,"let me gues , he played for the patriots ? lol"
7322,"ot course , you know they are my favorite team ! benjarvus green ellis was the player nd i ca n't even begin to fathom the pressure he must have felt to remain perfect ."
7323,probably a lot . that is one amazing record . its been great chanting ! have a nice ay !
7324,hi do you watch the nfl ?
7325,i sure do . id you know women can play too ?
7326,yeah as long as they meet the requirement there is no rule to stop them
7327,yup pretty much . there are only 11 min as of games play in a game
7328,yeah that is true and yet we are in front of teh tv for forever it seems
7329,yup pretty much . they are using tracking chips on the players in the field now
7330,yes they are collecting a bunch of info like velocity and rotation and such but not sure what for
7331,well i hope they can use them to make he game safer for the players
7332,that sounds good to me . u of iowa painted their visitor locker room pink
7333,i wonder why that is . bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s
7334,yeah things ave really changed now . do you know that thye highest score in college football is ?
7335,i think it was 2220 but i forget who played in that game . do you know ?
7336,"yes that was is and th game was played between geogia tech who won , and cumberland"
7337,"yeah them thanks . espn won an emmy once e , do you know what for ?"
7338,yes it was for the superimposed yellow line back in the day
7339,"yes and i am so grateful for taht line , it has made watching the games from home much easier"
7340,true . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
7341,yes he is a former rb who never fumbled the ball i his career
7342,wow amazing talent there . do you know who kellan moore i s ?
7343,yeah he is the only qb in the nfl that is left handed
7344,yeah i wonder if it gives him any advantages apt all
7345,car you a fan of he nfl ?
7346,i 'm not a great fan . i follow the ome . how about you ?
7347,"me too , i used to al ot more years ago , but i follow the are and there . a average nfl game only has like 11 minutes of actual gameplay now"
7348,that 's a lot of time watching for 11 minutes . and they say baseball moves tops low .
7349,right lol . both re moving in that direction . would you say you have a favorite team to watch of the 32 ?
7350,i am a rams fan since i grew up i southern cal . how about you ?
7351,"nice , rams almost had it this year ! i am a vikings fan , they almost had it last year ! is jared got your favorite qb ?"
7352,i would have to say yes . i used to love fran arlington when he was with the vikings .
7353,"for sure , he was a great quarterback back in the ay . have you heard of alex smith ?"
7354,"no , ho is eh ?"
7355,"he is the quarterback of the redskins , or was , heh ad a really bad injury this year on his leg . i was very smart , he got a degree as a sophomore adn then became the 1 overall pick as a qb"
7356,that s smart . interesting that they call soccer football . there may be more action in soccer but nothing ever really happens .
7357,"right lol , too much fake hopes in soccer . do you follow college football ?"
7358,"not at all . i used to follow all the sports , but now its ' mainly basebal ; . what sports do you follow teh most ?"
7359,i follow football and basketball most . my favorite college team is the iowa hawkeyes . info football they paint the opponents locker room pink
7360,thay 's too funny .
7361,or bring your own cans of paint lo . they do it because pick as a natural calming effect if you see i am psychology 101 i think
7362,sounds right . i thought they were trying to insult them l
7363,did you ever hear about the college game with a score of 2220 ?
7364,yes . would you have just walked of the field if you were on dcomberlasnd ?
7365,"i would have walked off the field when it got to like 1000 and never played again lol ! it was so nice chatting with you , enjoy your da !"
7366,"he ; lo , how are you ? i just read he university of iowa 's ; other room for visiting football team sis completely painted pink"
7367,wow that is strange
7368,also strange is in the 1960s op bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . isnt that crazy ?
7369,did n't hear that one efforts . did you know that 14 of the world 's largest stadiums belong to american college football teams ?
7370,"i did . that is crazy , i wonder shy the largest stadiums go to colleges ."
7371,maybe because they state is funding so they waste money on it
7372,makes sense i guess
7373,american flags at football stadiums can weight 1100 pounds and cost 50000
7374,"yeah right , thats so much money for a flag ."
7375,"also , a high school stadium in texas seats 18 , 000 people andc posts 60 million to build"
7376,crazy . did you know the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women would n fact be allowed if they met the league 's eligibility requirements .
7377,i wish they 'd get a chance . snoop dogg wrote af it song for his high school 's football team
7378,"that awesome , i wonder if it was rap lol former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career ."
7379,that 's hard to believe ! lots of technology involved in all ike chips in shoulder pads to record players moves .
7380,"yeah , i guess that makes sense , i wonder when they started doing that though ."
7381,"i do n't know . more pressure i guess to make the right moves , but less brains and more computer brains involved"
7382,"alex smith took so many ap bests in high school that he entered university as a junior . the quarterback received his bachelor 's degree in two years , and began working on a master 's degree , before becoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft ."
7383,"smart guy and motivated ! athletes do n't always get the credit for their brains . on a funny not e , brad johnson is the only quarterback to throw a touchdown to himself in nfl history"
7384,"thats amazing , lol how does that even work ?"
7385,i 'm wondering myself flow thaat was legal ?
7386,"i have not be , must have been by chance . good talking to you l , have a good one l"
7387,how much do you like football ?
7388,a lot . you ?
7389,"i really enjoy it , i pretty such watch even single am that i can ."
7390,do you watch college or pro football
7391,"usually i watch the nfl , but occasionally i 'll watch college ."
7392,i like pro cause it is more interesting . college football players most of them are not good . what do you think
7393,i agree . the problem i have with college is that there is just too many people to remember . i know most nfl players .
7394,i concur . do you watch other countries ' football lke canadian football
7395,no really . if nothing geese is on i might watch it or if i'n at a bar sometimes they have it on if no other sports are on .
7396,do you think af core nfc win this year super bowl
7397,"i want the nfc to in it , but the chiefs are a really good team and i think they would be my pick to win it all ."
7398,i strongly eleven the chief will make it to the conference debut not so sure about supper bowl cause of tshirt running back situation
7399,"not having their stated will for sure hurt hem , mahomes is a beast though . who do you think is gon na take the super bowl ."
7400,the irma cause they are pretty healthy
7401,"rams and chiefs are my current picks for the super bowl . they are both amazingly powerful was this year , seeing either one in the bowl would ben ice ."
7402,"yeah , both will be superbowls continuing team for a while"
7403,for sure . i ? m surprised at the rams blast law against the bears . d you think they will have a tough time in they play them again ?
7404,"in cold weather , it is for sure . by the way , nice chatting with you"
7405,"yeah , have a good day ."
7406,bye
7407,"hi , how are you ?"
7408,"hello , im great , what do you think about the jets and their goal to lane kirk cousins ."
7409,it think they should be thankful they did not land hi a they got a great young qb instead . . .
7410,"i think that is a great decision n , i father have a young b then they can polish him , nad i debt he wasnt as expensive as cousins ."
7411,"no , he was out of usc and rookie contracts are spotted so when he was chosen in the day t , they knew what they were going to pay him before choosing him ."
7412,"oh i see , so he was cheaper tha cousins then ? do you know how much they closed him for ?"
7413,probably around 4 years and 60 . shih seeems like a lot but cousins got nearly 75m per year !
7414,", i see , hopefully the qb they picked was a great have , you know brady wasnt picked to play with his is school football team , he was benched al ; the time and the tea , lost almost every game ."
7415,that 's odd . maybe he coach sa his talent and the lack of talent the offensive line had and decided to spare him all the sacks . maybe he wa protecting him . . .
7416,"who knows maybe he was or maybe he didnt know he had a future hall of famer in his rooster , are you watching the super ball this year ?"
7417,i am . what about you ? will you watch it ?
7418,"i will watch , for sure , with friends and family what team are you rooting fo r ?"
7419,"i am indifferent . i root for a good game and a good storyline . if t has that , i usually oj ' scare . althought every time i say that , i find myself rooting for one team during the game . it will probably be new this year . this are you rooting for ?"
7420,"i am rooting or the patriots , i am a fan of that team its amazing how much the game had evolved , players now have chips to track their moves and the football does as well"
7421,are you from ne ? i will be using chips too . i think it will be bbq chips or the ga e .
7422,"yes i am , and i have bee can since i watched benjarvus 'green ellis play , what a great r b !"
7423,he never fumbles ! i liked it . had him in fantasy one year . i wonder where he went ?
7424,"he is retired now , has been for a few years at least ."
7425,do you think tomb rey will retire if he win on sunday ?
7426,"i think he will , its a strong possibility , i think he has won it all and should retire at a high peak ."
7427,good luck sunday . nice chatting i you !
7428,thank you . i will be seeing for brady and te patriots for sure !
7429,do you think jon gruden and the raiders will get better next year qihtout mack ?
7430,"i dont know if it 's really all the lack of mack that is making them lose , gruden is very new as a head coach of the raiders , maybe he hasnt found hit footing yet"
7431,"' chuck ' as he is affectionately not , could hav done much better according to the critics"
7432,"is n't that a weird nickname , me ? i dont think i would want to be known for my preppy smile l"
7433,he sure looked like chuck after the loss to th jets and during the post game interview
7434,"it was a surprising lol for sure , they were leading at the half but 3"
7435,"mack has been huge for his nee team , the bears"
7436,heat he killed it in his first game against green bay . the bears are lucky to have him . theyre also a team that has a struggled a lot recently
7437,maybe if care would n't throw so many interceptions it would help too
7438,yea after yes 3 in the 2nd half they lost their lead and ended up getting destroyed by 20 points
7439,darnold has n't turned out to be the qb that the jets were hoping or i don ' think
7440,stone quarterbacks are n't earning their slavery . carr got paid 125 million m and did n't play very well .
7441,to upset gruden and think that e is better than he actually is
7442,"out of the 32 teams . the nfl , i think the raiders are close to the bottom"
7443,gruden is fed up with his team san carr '' s poor play
7444,you woudl think that with so 11 minutes of actual gameplay a wouldnt be that hard to coach a few to victory
7445,true . i have been rooting for hurley and geoff all year and hope they give hurley the mvp award
7446,"that woul did possible . h probably masked a ton o smokey too . which is crazy because when football started , even a pro bowler made twice as such as sar footbal player . times have changed"
7447,i am still no fan of dndamukong such
7448,do you like pets and taliban more ?
7449,i like this from back when hew as with denver .
7450,are you interested in the ravens ?
7451,"not so much , i 'm an eagles fan . are you ?"
7452,i am near foxboro s i guess i am a patriots fan . i do not follow sports that much .
7453,i ca n't believe it 's almost tim for the playoffs ! the first super bowl was at the end of the 1966 season .
7454,i remember that . i had already graduated from high school . i bet through high school with no super bowls . did n't miss it such !
7455,haha . i hear ya ! did you know an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
7456,"i does't believe that but it does seem like perry time they kick hte ball , they stop for a while to see what they did . i think it is a boring game ."
7457,"the highes score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 . i find that one hard to believe , too !"
7458,cumberland must have felt like linking off the field . i would like to hear what the coach a to say . ; lol
7459,"he was probably fired rights for the game . in other countries , they can soccer football . i find soccer really boring ."
7460,ugh so do i . it 's all too saw . i rather watch basketball .
7461,"there are some interesting footbal facts though . the circular huddle used in todays american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not read his hand signals ."
7462,a treat he did n't have to listen to all of the fans screaming .
7463,very true 12 there is only one left handed quaterback in the nfl .
7464,it must be hard for him . the world id made fo righthanded people .
7465,sure is . i did n't realize that bowlers made more than football players in the 60 's !
7466,"bowling used to be very popular . its boring to watch , though , bu than to play ."
7467,i have n't bowler in a long time ! i heard that new orleans saint cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player !
7468,i think that is a ridiculous rule . they ave to get up and leave . . . what if they are eating ?
7469,very old fashioned rule !
7470,some o those old rules should be changed .
7471,i agree ! nice chatting with you q
7472,"you a football fan ? did you know age university of iowa visiting football that locker room is painted pink ? for and games , i guess ."
7473,hello yes m i love football . that 's crazy they painted the room pink . i wonder if it worked ?
7474,no idea . the highest ever score n a football game was 2220 in 1916 . pretty rut ; .
7475,wow that 's a crazy high score ! the 1960 's bowlers made twice a such as top football stars .
7476,haha . how mimes ahve changed . i bet bowlers do n't even make 10 percent of what footballers make now .
7477,"haha yea i have no idea what bowlers make , but i bet it 's not a lot . did you know greenellis never fumbled in hi entire nfl career ?"
7478,thaat ? s a pretty great accomplishment . espn won an emmy for creating the yellow first down mark on the field when you 're watching games . that was a game changer for sure . hard to imagine watching games without it now .
7479,that 's pretty cool . did you know the is no written rule against female players playing in the nfl ?
7480,i 'd love tv see a female in the league . nfl cheerleaders for hte saints are n't allowed to eat at hte same restaurant as the players . i guess theyd o n't want them fraternizing .
7481,yea i think a lot of teams have rulers abou fraternizing with cheerleaders .
7482,"i gyess they likd veto keep track of things . , like how the use chips in th players ' shoulder pads to track every move on th field ."
7483,that ' e funny they kept chips . the average lifetime earnings off an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player ?
7484,"huh , interesting . i guess because an engineers career lasts longer . never thought of it taht way . the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . thank goodness for instant replays !"
7485,"yes , thank goodness for that . do you know much about quarterbacks ?"
7486,a fair bit . like kellan moor is the only lefthanded qb in the snl .
7487,oh wow i did n't know that . baker mayfield almost quit football to pursue a career in professional gaming .
7488,"hhaa . what game did he play , do you know ? alexis mitch entered college as sa junior because he took so many ap tests ."
7489,"i have no idea what grades he played , but very funny ."
7490,"actually , i think it was halo 3 ! oven of tom brady 's hs teams did n't win a game or score a touchdown all session . he was on the bench the whole time ."
7491,i ca n't believe tom brady was never drafted a it was a gem to find for hte patriots .
7492,"yeah , that 's an understatement . been great taking with you !"
7493,hi how are you ?
7494,"i 'm great ! hi how are you , too ?"
7495,i m doing well . are yu a fan of football ?
7496,i sometimes follow it . i try to watch the super bowl . you ?
7497,yes i am a pittsburg steelers fan ! did you know theres no written rules about girls playing in the nfl ?
7498,"yeah , that sounds right . i dont thik anyone ever expected women to try . do you think women will ever play ?"
7499,i doubt it . that would be impressive though . maybe as a kicker if nothing !
7500,"a kicker , sure . maybe a punters . i figure hat there is something ."
7501,true that . there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game on average . crazy !
7502,"yeah , a lot of standing around and waiting . i could just watch the highlights and it would be enough ."
7503,i agree ! the saints are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as their cheerleaders . o weird .
7504,these outdated attitudes should change . the cheerleader are not the problem .
7505,totally . there is only one left handed qb in the nfl ! good for him .
7506,i wonde row often he plays . i bet it would hero off teh defenses .
7507,i have no idea but that probably helps !
7508,i wonder . i think that batters in baseball have trouble with certain pitchers . i figure it must have a parallel in football .
7509,im sure there is . funny that iowas visitor locker room is painted all in pink !
7510,"does that even work ? if i did , every team would try the same stunt ."
7511,oi would think . it sounds pretty dirty to me !
7512,"waht is the home record of u of iowa ? i rest my case . anyway , great chat !"
7513,no idea 2 nice chatting with you !
7514,have a great day !
7515,also funny how bowlers i 1960 made more than top football stars ! have a good one !
7516,"hello , do you liek football ? i think the qb is the most im ; cortana player on the team"
7517,"yea , a good qb like kurt cousins gives the redskin a better chance ethan starting ark sanchez"
7518,"he did provide ability to the team , are you a fan of the redskins ?"
7519,no but i 'm a giants fans so i know a lot about the arrivals . losing cousins to the vikings really hurt the redskins
7520,"i be it did , cousins is a good player , i bet hte vikings knew that , hopes he halo a great carreer tough"
7521,yea it 's too bad smith got injured too after he ended up replacing cousins
7522,smith is one of the oldest players on the team right ?
7523,8 believe so . too bad the redskins did n't try to get mayfield . hes ' the bronx 30th starting qb
7524,"i think the patriots have the best qb on the league , brady is a great leader"
7525,yea brady is great . so is rivers of the chargers
7526,"yeah rivers is mother played that i like , what do you think about qb like alex smith or mayfield ?"
7527,i think mayfield has a lot of potential nd before his injury smith was a reliable qb
7528,"i think they are both good , you know that mayfield is also a great gamer ,"
7529,"yea , i hard he like halo . did you know russell wilson has a major league baseball contract ?"
7530,"i dint really snow who he is son o moment there , is there an interesting fact behind that contract ?"
7531,"wilson is the qb fo they seahawks , he used to play in league baskeball and signed a contract with the tx rangers"
7532,"oh i see , interesting , did you hear about benjarvus greenellis ?"
7533,i remember eh use to play for the patriots not to long ago
7534,"yeah around 2011 , cool fact about him , he never fumbled the ball in his entire nfl carreer ! ! !"
7535,that 's impressive . did you know that coach matt patricia is an actual rocket scientist ?
7536,"a rocket scientist ! ! ! wow that is impressive , he use be a really mart man ."
7537,are you a football fan ?
7538,i am a fan of the game do ou like th nfl ?
7539,"i do with on tv when my saints are playing ; . puts not quite the same as being there , but tickets are too expensive . i like the yellow 1st down line on tv which gives a perspective of how far it it . did you know espn won an em , my for that creation . ?"
7540,"so you are a few of the saints , cool , and no , why did espn won an emmy for ?"
7541,"espn won an emmy for the yellow line overplayed on the field so when watching on tv , the viewer knows how far it is to first down . it gives a bit of perspective on what is going through the quarterback 's didn . do you have a favorite quarterback ?"
7542,"i guess the yellow first down line is a big contribution to the game and yeah mine is tom brady i also like alex smith , do you hve a favorite one ?"
7543,"brees , obviously . historically , i liked archie manning , but he did not have the evel of success on the field that his sons had . what i did not know is that at i time , the nfl had a deaf qb , paul d . hubbard . he created he circular huddle so the opposing team could not read his hand signals !"
7544,"those sounds ike great qbs im not familiarized with them , b peer mayfield is another great qb and sounds like hubbard created a legacy ."
7545,i would say so considering they still use the circular huddle . i was surprised and pleased when i learned that we had a female nfl referee officiating the payoff games . do you ever think we will have female nfl players ?
7546,"i do n't think so , maybe a polo other division but not in the same league as men 's , i think that would be really unfair and actually scary to watch"
7547,"probably so , but perhaps a woman will try out since the league rule swallow it should be meet the eligibility requirements . perhaps as a kicker since it i sa lower contact position . what are your thoughs on tech in football like the tracking chips the nfl use on shoulder pads andc in the ball ?"
7548,"i think that tech ks taking over the game an that is great , all kinds of coo stats can be known thanks to that so o think its great , that such as the moves of players , speed of the ball nad many more ?"
7549,"i also think is could be a good training aid , especially for the qb . it could let the qb know the speed and rotation of the throw ; after all the best throw is a fast tight spiral . do you follow collegiate football ?"
7550,"i do follow it , some of te tiem at least but mostly of l , kind of makes me angry that games only have 11 minutes of ive gameplay ."
7551,"i am having trouble figuring out where the rest of the time goes . after all , they only 20 seconds tho huddle , line up , and snap the ball . i gues in he play lasts less than 20s seconds and results in a dead ball then that could b earth of the reason why !"
7552,"yeah i guess a still seems like little tiem , games tend to last a long time and only 11 minutes is unfair to fans ."
7553,"true . i prefer to watch it live and am a season ticket holder for my alma mater , the lsu tigers . dud you know that hte highest scoring football game was in collegiate with georgia alec beating cumberland 2220 in 1916 ?"
7554,"2220 ! ! ! is that real ? can , how ca na team lose by that many points use they even play 'the same sport lol ."
7555,what i also find interesting is some of the quirky outfield rules . i the one forbidding saints cheerleaders from eating in the same restaurant as nfl players . its unfair that theyd bust leave even if they were there first and already eating !
7556,"that is really unfair , the nfl should ban that rule and hte saints should change it not only sexist but asl humid , rating rule , makes me feel angry and disgusted ."
7557,it seems so immature ! like the university of iowa painting the visiting football team 's locker room all pink ! is that suppose to humiliate o intimidate the opposing team ?
7558,"that is so funny , can you imagine being the opposite team and then arriving at . all pink locker room , the look in their faces 786 priceless anyway its been col chatting with you today ."
7559,"thanks and same to yiu ! and keep your day job . after all , an engineer , or likely almost any tehcnicak professional , barns more in their lifetime career than the average nfl player !"
7560,"hello there , are you excited for the upcoming super bowl ?"
7561,"of course i am , counting the hours till sunday what team are you cheering for ?"
7562,"i think i will be cheering on hte ram , but mostly for hte score dependent on what numbers i get . any kind of pool i 'm in . how abou yourself ?"
7563,"i am rooting for the patriots , are the rams your favorite team i nthe leage ?"
7564,"no i am a packers fan l i just think the rams had a good season and deserve it , plus the pats have won it enough recently ! how about you ?"
7565,"yeah could be , my favorite team is are the patriots but i wouldnt mind if they lose , i just want to watch a great game !"
7566,"yeah i 'm the same way , i like when the game is a game still late in the 4th quarter and it takes some awesome plays to win it ."
7567,"i agree , so did you know about hte tracking chips the players have ?"
7568,no i do n't know too much about taht . i imagine they have them in their helmets to track its for concussion studies ?
7569,"i think they track the moves to have a better deal of the plays , location , distance gunned amount others , they football also has a chip ."
7570,"yeah i think you are right t , pretty sure they have them in boulder pads as well ."
7571,you know engineers end up winning more money than football players and without all that brain damage .
7572,"yeah i think i ahve area tthat they ear more in a lifetime overall , probably because they work their wheel career vs . average football players maybe 8 years ."
7573,"hen you put it that way a football player does earn more , in the 60s they didnt as bowlers made more money that football players ."
7574,yeah is n't that crazy to think the top bowlers were the big ballers back in the 60 's . oh man what a life to be a pro bowler in the 60 's lol .
7575,"i wonder how much they actually earned lol , did you hear about thee emmy espn won ?"
7576,i think i remember them winning one after they came out with the yellow line for the first down line on tv games right ?
7577,"new that is right , i guess it is pretty usefull and deserves an award , it did change things"
7578,"yeh it definietly is very useful to everyone watching on tv . do you know what the highest scoring game ever was , college or pro ?"
7579,"i dont know about pro , i college it was 2200 k thats a humiliating loss ."
7580,"yeah you 're right ! is n't that just an insane score , you would have to score on basically every a . well nice chatting with you today , i hope you have a good day ."
7581,"hey ! it 's quite interesting , but nfl has no written rules against female players . it 's just difficult to believe ."
7582,ixn'rt it ! the would have to be some tough females !
7583,"take . i say they have to get te eligibility requirements , but i 'm wondering what kind of requirements they may have ."
7584,"alex slight took so many p tests in high school that he entered university as a onion . the quarterback received his bachelor 's degree in two years , and be working on a master 's degree , before becomign the first overall pick in the 20th fl draft . a would be interesting to see !"
7585,"it 's amazing . i 'm sure it 's difficult to combine all together , b ut he is very talented"
7586,"this is relaly interesting too ! baker mayfield , quarterback , university of oklahoma , once considered quitting football to pursue fulltime competitive gaming , adn claims to be able to beat anyone at the university f oklahoma oneonone in halo 3 ."
7587,i did n't now that . i guess of so many people know it .
7588,i bet he would not have a the moneys e is no ! i didn ? r know the nfl was 32 trams .
7589,quite surprise for me it the average lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earning of nfl player . i was sure they make a lot
7590,thats all you hear ! how much they make . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes og live gameplay
7591,", shocked me . i can not believe . just 11 minutes ? ? ? ? ?"
7592,yes ! and the average game lasts 2 . 6 to 3 hours !
7593,"honestly , i 'll take a look in the internet . it 's just difficult to believe ."
7594,"let me know what you find ! nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed nd location ."
7595,good point . nfl has a lot of data .
7596,"definition of football . football is a fairly of team sports that involve , to varying degrees , kicking a ball to score a goal ."
7597,it 's very road definition . soccer rebel it for sure .
7598,"yeh , i had never heard of association football ."
7599,do you watch or play s ; it often ?
7600,"no , not at all . you ? are highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220"
7601,it was long time ago . i 'm not sure it would b possible in 2019
7602,especially with only 11 minutes of actual play time !
7603,absolutely !
7604,back had they even made mode money in footbal . in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice asmr such as top footbal ; stars .
7605,"i did n't know it ! well , it was my pleasure to all with you . have a good day !"
7606,u2 ! nice talking with you !
7607,thanks .
7608,good morning to you
7609,"hello there , do you follow the nfl and ll ?"
7610,"i sure do , i was 'the game every sunday when its on , do you ?"
7611,"yeah i usually follow during 'the reason , my team did n't make 'the playoffs this year so that was disappointing ."
7612,who is your team ?
7613,"i like the packers , do you follow a tea m ?"
7614,yea im a patriots fan . sorry haha
7615,"lol , well you have had one hell of ar un the last 20 years or so !"
7616,"he yea , weve been lucky with tom brady"
7617,"yeah you sure have , the coach as well , bellicheck will go down s the best ever in my opinion ."
7618,he is pretty good ! but robert kraft ? uh oh haha hes gotten int some troubles
7619,"yeah that was n't want i would of done with that much money , but fly t vegas for the day !"
7620,or have an escort come to your house ! c'mon man
7621,"exactly , now he will be forever associated with this incident !"
7622,"ah well , it does fake for kind of a funny story . did you know tom brady actually played backup qb in high school for junipero serra high school and was never started ?"
7623,"holy crap , i never knew hat . i wonder hat scout for college was like , they whos that guy on teh bench ?"
7624,haha right ? and what woul have made him to show brady for the college team ? stories like tha stare ironic
7625,yeah those stories are ! funny how some of the best ever start out .
7626,"i wonder when we will start to see female nl payers , theres no written rule against having them on the teams"
7627,"i think that would be so cool if one did , it would give young girls in all sports hope to make it pro ."
7628,it would . i wonder why none have hopper dont the trend yet
7629,"hi , how are you doing today ? it is certainly a fine day for a chat with new friend s ."
7630,hi ! hope you 're doing well ! so are you a fan of the b position ? i am simply because he touches the ball nearly every play on offense plus calls the plays in teh huddle !
7631,"the qb i 'the no . h reruns the show , and makes things go , do n't you know !"
7632,so true ! is n't crazy there 's only one left handed quarterback in the nfl and that 's kellan moore ?
7633,i guess there must be an issue with lefties . perhaps the offense must be run differently ? i do n't know . interesting though .
7634,"agreed . can you also be , even the circular huddle american football uses today was invented by a deaf qb so opposing teams could n't read his hand signals ? that was very smart of him !"
7635,that was certainly very smart of him ! now everyone copies that deaf qb . a trendsetter indeed .
7636,very true ! then you ? ve got geniuses is alex smith who entered college as a junior and earned his bachelor 's in two years . that 's someone i 'd want on my team ! ha !
7637,he must have studied very hard and done well in his coursework . he probably had ther tight mind for a qb .
7638,"indeed ! but then you have qbs like baker mayfield who considered quitting football for competitive gaming . that would have been a huge mistake , in my opinion !"
7639,"i agree . the only , the glory . football much better ! much !"
7640,"so try ! i tell you , i could n't believe tom brady 's jv high team refuse duo start him despite never winning a game or even scoring a touchdown . that is sad and i bet they regret tthat since he 's now a four time superbowl champ !"
7641,"he 's got five now , right ? even more regret for them ! lol"
7642,no kidding ! he 's a great player . i truly love the nfl bu tit surprised me that the average game is only 11 minutes long in terms of live gameplay . that ' almost unbelievable !
7643,i think it 's still a tough game . lots of injuries . short careers .
7644,"agree . i believe hte short careers is why engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players , sadly ."
7645,do n't let your sons and daughters grow up to be nfl players ! it ai n't worth it !
7646,"no kidding . speaking of income , did you know the top bowlers made more than top football players back in the 1960s ? that is crazy !"
7647,i pink it was a golden age of bowling . the polyester pants made hte bowler physique quite charming .
7648,"tha is true ! but with players like benajrvus greenellis who 's never tumbled the football in hi entire pro career , i 'd imagine he deserves movie than the top bowlers these days . ha !"
7649,"yes , he does . anyway , great chat ! have a good day !"
7650,"and of course , i 'm surprised the league has no female players wind there 's no rules forbidding them from playing as long as teh meet the eligibility requirements ! well it was great chatting wit you as well ! take care , friend !"
7651,"hey there , do you have a favorite quarterback or anything like ethan ? i like to watch tom brady a lot"
7652,"yeah , he 's pretty cool . in 's a favorite in his hometown of san kate , c ay i ca n't believe he was passed up on when h news on the jv team of his high school . their los s !"
7653,"yeah that definitely was a stupid move on their part . alex smith though maybe he m , pissed his calling . he was a genius and got his bachelor 's degree in only two years . and he was working on his master 's but then was drafted into the nfl . he might have green able to do a whole , ot more without doing the football thing"
7654,"wow ! i know , right ? ! i wish i were off to college my junior year in high school but at the rate he was going with his ap tests , its not suprise he would skip 12 grade in high school . hte fact that he could dance all of that an football is pretty amazing . he 's an athletic genius : ,"
7655,i agree with you ! what do you think about kellen moore as well ? he 's the only lefthanded quarterback in the league i wonder if that gives him an advantage or not ?
7656,"that says a lot , i know that lefty 's are highly regarded in general . i think it would give him an advantage since most players may be right handed so he 's able to really dodge the other players when passing he ball . i bet he did n't fumble hte ball as much either ."
7657,"yep that ' a s good point l w behave to do some research on that i also , i wonder if the deaf quarterback did research when he invented the circular huddle . it 's such a genius thing , that i ca n't believe it was invented earlier"
7658,that was a pretty clever move on their part because you know that opposing team is always looking for ways to figure out their opponents next move . i wonder if they have any deaf quarterbacks no w ? they would probably do better than the players that can hear because sometimes those guys do '
7659,that 's a good question . i do n't think that they have them in the professional weeks anyway . did you hear about how the university of iowa painted the opposing team 's lockerroom pink ? that would actually make me play better i think
7660,"wow , totally emasculating to say the least lol but you 're right , it would make me want to work harder at winning so that my team gets the last laugh h : , do you think the locker room is still pink or was that back in the day ? i would think they would not have to ha way now because everyone is so worried about being politically correct the days ."
7661,"haha you 're right about taht ; i guarantee someone would complain but i . e ou kno wthe highest football score of all time by the way ? it was 2220 to 0 , talk about a blowout lol"
7662,"yeah , i would say at team got beat don lol kinda embarrassing for the losing team . maybe that team was in the wrong division to start with . i have n't seen anything that high of score 've . i guess that was more like a practice game for georgia tech . i wonder how the cumberland team is doing now ? i 'm sure their coach reminds them to note very allow that again lol"
7663,"that 's a good question . because k do n't really watch college sports i do n't know , hopefully they 're doing better though lol i do n't think they ahve a buy like benjarvus greenellis though he 's never fumble the ball they would have done a lot better if they had him"
7664,"oh yeah , benjarvus greenellis was the man ! a telasth e can always brag about not ever fu , thing the ball to the grand kids . i 'm sure not every football player cab say the same . where is geenellis now ? di she askew hill of fame ? i hope so !"
7665,"i hope so too ! i do n't know that he plays anymore , but i do n't really keep up with football that much now . i also thin kit ' crazy how htey us tracking chips on the players . technologies becoming so advanced now"
7666,"yes , technology has taken over so much . pretty soon they 'll be da chip in hte players body which they should because some of those guys ar trouble makers lol i do n't follow football much bu they seem to make headlines lol i was noticed how much the nfl has advanced in owner technological ways with all the angles they are able to get on camera during the games and the wireless microphones that the team coaches and assistants get to wear to track their tea more aww sell ."
7667,"yep i could see that . it 's kind of scary and hopefully they can take those chips and cameras off once hey leave the find . i hope that civilian never have to wear those , because you can track everything from location to speed to velocity and rotation , it 's a channing world that 's for sure"
7668,"its a little creepy if you think about it . but i totally agree , i hope they ' r enable yo have a little privacy once they are off teh field . i noticed that women are able to play in the nfl if they pass the requirements needed to play . i do n't know if i would want to play among al those sweaty big guys ll but i think its pretty cool for a women to play . i think there is one female in the nfl that i know of ? not sure though ."
7669,"no here is not a female player in hte nfl yet . but there is no rule against it . i would be very interested to see one start playing though . there is no rule so it 's possible , but they would have to be really one , that 's for sure , adn also know how to take a hit potentially"
7670,exactly ! i wonder how the male players would feel about tackling down a female the way they do their fellow male team mates . but i 'm sure it would n't be so bad given thet the gram only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
7671,"yep that 's true . and also , would they all use the same locker room , or if there was only one girl on the team would be get her in locker room , who knows ? i just do n't know how it would work but i 'm sure we could figure out a way so that everyone would be happy"
7672,the nfl his one of the major sports league in north america a .
7673,do you watch the nfl ?
7674,"yes . it my favourite sports , the only regular season starts from september to december . whuch is your favourite tea , ?"
7675,my favorite team is the baltimore ravens . what about yours ?
7676,super bowl is my favorite ep nfl earn high revenue higher than other players .
7677,i would bet the quarterbacks are the highest paid team members . they tend to be the most famous players .
7678,quarterbacks are members of the offensive team and line up directly behind the offensive team .
7679,"even though they line up behind the offensive line , they are considered the tea leader ."
7680,nfl uses tracking chips int he players shoulder pad to record their movement in the field . this type technology improvement make the game very effective .
7681,"i think it would be interesting to see a niagra of the record movement . nfl players move around a lot in a game , even with just 11 minutes of live gameplay on average ."
7682,they are using circular huddle pad to avoid other year players watch the sign in the field . this type of tactics are very important and make the game very intereting .
7683,"football requires a lot of strategic skill and tactics to ploy successful plays , since weighted team knows what the other will do ."
7684,"in october 1916 , the game held between georgia tech and cumberland , it is the highes score game in footbal when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 ."
7685,"you almost have to wonder if cumberland ' steam was sleeping on the field ! it 's rare for a team o score p pounts . even if tey just played offensively , you ' c think they woudl have stopped the opposing team from scoring so much ."
7686,"yeah . it is very true . i could n't imagine how it happens , the poor performance by cumberland . it was a black day for cumberland ."
7687,they could use a payer like the patriots ' running back benjarvus greenellis a he 's never made a fumble in his entire time in the nfl !
7688,yes . the only has no written yule against female players .
7689,8 wonder what the physical requirements are for a moment o be able to lay . i would personally be scared to go o nthe field with all those powerful guys around me !
7690,"they are making fit ifr the makes , it is very necessary to maintain good health condition for playing ."
7691,"i can believe that . they train to ne so fast and strong . some of them are very smart on , like alex mitch . hue took advanced placement tests and high school and did so well hee entered college as a thirdyear student !"
7692,all the players are trained to achieve the excellence so they are working hard . they re very highly paid athlete compared to other player .
7693,"it makes me feel like i ought to go do some exercise myself , even if i 'm no football player ! in was great talking to you ."
7694,good day there . or a football fan ? i am mad the nfl season is over r th superbowl was kind of disappointing but i enjoyed the 16 regular season games .
7695,"hello there , i am and i agree ! it was n't as fun as over years , my team did n't even make the playoffs so that was sa d ."
7696,oh bummer r ! yeah just have to wait until next year . maybe it will be the exciting . the nfl tracks movements if players and the ball using a chip !
7697,"yep , always next season . and yeah , i think that is good , i hope it helps with players safety ."
7698,yeah me too . . many injuries . football waist always popular though . back in the 60 's bowlers made more ! twice as much in fact .
7699,yeah there really are a lot . and wow ! 9 gues sit shows just how popular the nfl has become since then .
7700,exactly . there are also various other forms o football like rugby and australian rules .
7701,there was a big australian rules tournament eli in my town last summer !
7702,oh that 's awesome ! do they have a quarterback it ' z one of my favorite positions because they touch the all almost every play .
7703,"i do n't tend id , and yeah they are the most important player on the field even during a team game l"
7704,yeah . tom brady is one of the best . did you know he dud n't even start when he played junior varsity in high school ?
7705,"yeah he sure is , and i think i read that , wonder how he got scouted in the first place ?"
7706,yeah good question . the qb alex smith is a smart guy too . he tooo so many ap classes that he got his degree in 2 years !
7707,"holy cow , that is impressive , it sounds like he would have gone to any field he wanted ."
7708,yeah agreed . funny yu say that because bader mayfield 's field of choice was almost competitive gaming !
7709,"that is hilarious ! i think i read about that a while back , do you , now his game was ?"
7710,yeah believe it was also 3 ! wonder if he will plays video games ?
7711,"that was it ! good cal l , ad i 'm sure he does , but probably foresight or something now ."
7712,yeah foresight is crazy popular . i wonder how much they make in comparison to the nfl ? despite that everyone thinks engineers actually make more money in their life than nfl players .
7713,"is n't that interesting , but i think it is because theuy have a very long career as opposed tos sports players ."
7714,yeah those nfl players get hammered with injuries . very tough on the body . but some players can take th emits liek greenellis who never fumbled the ball once !
7715,do you watch football ? there ' ? s no written rule tha women ca n't play in teh nfl . i 'd love to see that !
7716,i do watch it ! who your favorite team ? and me too ! i wonder if any have ever tried out yet
7717,my favorite team is the could . who 's your favorite ? the average nfl game only has about 11 minutes of actual gameplay . thank goodness for instant replay !
7718,i root f teh patriots . 11 minutes is so short ! the game stops so often
7719,third is interesting an engineer over the course of his or her career will earn more than an nfl player . crazy .
7720,"well if you think about it , an engineer may have like , 45 working years . an average nfl career might only be 10 years at the most , and this average factors in the regular players . not everyone is a superstar making millions"
7721,"true . speaking of the patriots , former rb benjarvis greenellis never had a fumble n his career . wonder how many times he had the ball ?"
7722,haha i hope your than 1 or else tha stab isnt as impressive . i feel ike he was a common target back in his day
7723,the highest ever football scope was 220 i 1916 . the other team could n't even get on the board .
7724,i wounder at what point they just gave up and tried to rack up the score ? i fee ; like they couldnt have been that dominated
7725,"haha . in the 60 's the top bowlers made more than the football stars . oh , how times have changed ."
7726,rights ? i wonder why ! nowadays i bet most people cant name even oven pro bowler
7727,"i know i ca n't . i do n't even know if they show bowling on tv anymore , liken hey used to when i was younger ."
7728,"i definitely cant name any , and i also have never even seen bowling on tv . i imagine it would be pretty boring to watch"
7729,"oddly , i used to watch it a lot in the 80 's . but we only had 3 4 channels and it was the only thing on . did you know espn won an emmy for the creation of the first yard line yellow line on tv ? way a great innovation ."
7730,thaat yellow line saved football n tv i say . if is an absolute sail and probably one of the most important inventions for tv football
7731,total ; i agree . i remember when they tried to apply to the same sort of thing to the hockey puck . was n't as popular .
7732,which i think it would be way more useful in hockey ! i can never follow that puck
7733,me neither . u think it was a good idea . but the hardcore fans hated it too hey dumped it . did you know allan moore is the only lefthanded qb in the league ? wonder if that gives him any kind of advantage .
7734,i feel like it would help him sometimes because so many linemen might be trained to aim for the qbs right side
7735,"yeah , i wa thinking the same thing . any advantage is a good advantage . qb alex smith took so many ap tests in hs that he started college as a junior . smart kid ."
7736,"thati an insane amount so ap tests , i cant imagine how he coul dave managed all o tthat in high school , i could barely manage 1"
7737,hhaa . same here . hew as working on his master 's degree before he was drafted first overall ink teh 2005 draft .
7738,he had a good fallback plan at east ! did you know the modern huddle was created by a deaf qb back in the day because he and to use hand signals ? he did n't want hte other team to see what he was signing
7739,that 's awesome !
7740,high how are you
7741,good . ia tom brady still with the patriots ?
7742,ye she s do now .
7743,when is the new np championship game ?
7744,i think next month .
7745,do you have a guess which team i going to win ?
7746,no i have no clue . you ?
7747,the patriot s ?
7748,maybe i could like hem to bu the knows .
7749,i 'm not that familiar with nfl team . i know it consists of 32 teams .
7750,"yes . the nfl 's 17week regular season runs from early september to late december , with each team played get games and having one bye week ."
7751,are young on to watch the next super bowl ? it 's usually held first sunday of february .
7752,yes i will be watching with my family .
7753,do you usually watch the games at home ? my friend clberate the super bowl like it is christmas .
7754,yes i watch at home
7755,do you know that the american flags you see at stadiums weigh 110 grounds ?
7756,i had no clue hard to believe
7757,"they cast approximately 50 , 000 to make them ."
7758,wow thats a lot of money
7759,nfl owners can afford it .
7760,oh espn won an emmy for the creation of th superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games .
7761,i did not know hat . did they collaborate with the nfl ?
7762,yes they did
7763,i have to run . it was nice chatting with you .
7764,hi how are you ? are you a football person ?
7765,"love the sport , baker mayfield is one of my favorite players , what about yourself ?"
7766,i dont know baker . who is he ?
7767,"he is a famous qb , he had a strong debut on the browns"
7768,"oh , did the browns do well this season n ? is he one of the best in the league ?"
7769,"i do n't think his the best , brady is the best qb in the league but mayfield ha strong skills"
7770,"brady plays for the patriots , yes ? he is one of the best . six rings t this point ?"
7771,"9 think he does yeah , he is a legend and the most important player in the team , well quarterbacks are usually the most important players in the field"
7772,"yah , they touch hte ball on every play , s i guess they have to eb talented . who are the other good qbs ?"
7773,"kellan moore is another great one , he used to be hte only left handed qb on the nfl"
7774,why the only one ? is there a problem with lefties ?
7775,"i hae no idea i think there are a couple more now another good qb is 'bad johnson , he holds an intresting stat"
7776,brad johnson ? don now him . he is not a lefty is he ?
7777,"no , he is the only qb in nfl history to throw a td pass to himself ."
7778,how diff he do that ? by accident ? i want to see the film of that .
7779,yea hi think that the ball got tipped on a defensive player and then he caught it .
7780,that ie great ! one for the record books . what do you think of u of iowas little stunt ?
7781,"i think that stunt was really funny , the magic of football not only strange anecdotes bt funny ones as well"
7782,"i wonder if it works at all . does u of iowa win at his e ? anyway , great chat"
7783,"thats a topic for a google search as a matter of fact im going to look over that right now , its been great chatting with you as well , bye"
7784,have a great evening ! thanks for the chat ll
7785,"a lot of cool facts , i feel lot wiser , thanks a lot , bye ."
7786,hi how are you ? do you like the football ? .
7787,"hello , i 'm a life long football fan ."
7788,i do not really know the game well . i sometimes watch . usually the playoffs .
7789,at least yo watch the important games . the rest is just positioning for playoffs .
7790,i guess . who is your favorite team ?
7791,i like the cincinnati bengals . how about you ?
7792,i like the underdog in the us ; er bowl . i think that it is fun when they beat the favored team .
7793,"haha , yes it 's very easy 5o riot for an underdog . speaking of underdogs , i was shocked to read there s only 1 left handed qb in all of the nfl ."
7794,why is that . is there something unusual about lefties ? are they a problem ?
7795,"kellen moore is th only lefty . it 's subtle differences , she ball spins different and th qb 's blindside is opposite ."
7796,so the rest of the team has to play differently ? ok . that would make dense . then the cost that to make different plays ?
7797,"they do n't play different exactly . you just have your best lineman blocking the blindxside as the 's where the defenses best layer usually line sup to attack the b from out of vision line , . that blockers never learns o play right side . plus just fewer people are lefties i assume lol ."
7798,ok . that are sense . what do you thin of the university of iowa and their little painting scheme . ?
7799,it looks nice on tv .
7800,i supposed it is a losing color for the tv audience . i hadnt though of that .
7801,i assume the intent was to little o ; opponents like they are little girls but it looks coo wheat hey show locker room shots i think .
7802,j dont mind pink it gets me excited to play . i want to play harder when i surrounded by pink .
7803,i love when the nfl players wear pink shoes andc loves during breast cancer awareness month . it just pops and very slick locking . what do you think about that or
7804,i think that it would be a little too such for me in my pink lower room . there is such a thing as too much .
7805,"haha very true , they knew what that were doing when they painted the visiting locker room pink ."
7806,"they were not interior decorations . they should have consulted experts . anyway , thanks for the chat !"
7807,very tri indeed ! have a great day stranger !
7808,"tanks . you too , total stranger !"
7809,bye !
7810,"hello , do you know much about quarterbacks ?"
7811,i know a little trivia about that particular football position . are we referring to american footbal lord canadian style ?
7812,american football . did you know alex smith too so many ap tests in high school that he was a junior when he went to college .
7813,smart dude ! he even started working on his master 's before he became the overall 1st pick in the draft .
7814,very smart guy . the circular huddle was created by a qb who was deaf .
7815,yeah . was n't his name hubbard ?
7816,yep i believe so .
7817,deaf qbs water are in the almost as rare as lefthanded was . i think there is only one . the league right now . . .
7818,yes they are . i ca n't think of many left handers over the years . only other one that comes to mind is vick .
7819,"i think the current one is named kellan moore . some of hte greats were lefthanded , such a john alway and jim kelley ."
7820,oh idea i forgot bout alway . baker mayfield once thought about quitting football to pursue a career in professional gaming .
7821,mayfield . . . was n't he qb at the univ of oklahoma ?
7822,"i ca n't recall where he played in college e , but that sounds right . he plays for the browns now ."
7823,tha in a team that has a da rough go at the position f qb ! their franchise would be alot different today if they had a q alike superbowl champion tom brady .
7824,yea they have had terrible luck with qbs . did you know the nfl has no written rule against women playing ?
7825,are you suggesting that cleveland should consider putting a woman in at qb ? it couldnt ' hurts ny !
7826,haha i would like to see that actually .
7827,"the saints do n't allow their cheerleaders o dine with players , so securing a qb spot would open up a world of dining that most find an incentive !"
7828,i think a lot of teams have rules around players interacting with cheerleaders .
7829,"well , with the average gameplay time of 11 minutes , what does it really matter ?"
7830,good talking to you !
7831,hi . are you into the los angeles chargers ?
7832,i am not really into football in general . how about you ?
7833,bo . but the los angeles chargers seem to have good track record . the are the 11th best in defense in the nfl this year .
7834,they also have the best net passer rating for 2018 along with the chiefs .
7835,"huh , i did not know that . and apparently teh also core m . 6 points per drive ."
7836,net passer rating is a reliable limos test for super bowl caliber teams so they are super bowl contenders .
7837,"yes , i think that they are . they are tied with the chiefs in 2018 ."
7838,they also have the seventh best offensive line in the nfl right now
7839,wow . i did not know that . football is also layed soccer in some countries .
7840,were really love our football in the us . 14 of the world 's 25 biggest stadiums belong to american college football teams .
7841,yes ! and did you know that th highest score ever in a football game occured ink 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland with a score of 2220 ? !
7842,i wonder wat happened to make the score so bad !
7843,"i have no idea . i wish i knew how the score cold get so hire . they must have changed the rules since then . i have never heard of gaelic football , have you ?"
7844,"no , i have not heard of gaelic football though i have heard of australian football . i think it 's th sesame as american football but the ball is larger ."
7845,and then ther eis rugby football . they have a rugby league or rugby union . so many different versions of football . it makes my head spin .
7846,football certainly ahs come a long way . it 's crazy teh technology that is used in american football these days .
7847,i thin kit is awesome that formed patriots runningback greenellis never fumbled teh football at all during his whole career .
7848,that is maaszing . some football playes are just so talented . brad johnson k a superbowl winning quarterback has thrown a touchdown was to himself .
7849,wow . has it that possible ? and the average nfl mate ahs only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
7850,"i am not sure how it 's possible . and yeah , there is n't a lot of gameplay which is probably why i ma not into football ."
7851,"yeah , me too . some of the rules seem crazy t me . hey , it has been great . thanks ."
7852,i still have so much to learn about the nfl .
7853,do you follow football ? college or nfl ?
7854,"i follow both actually , i love e eagles and ducks !"
7855,the ducks are oregon ? i 've heard that iowa painted th locker room for visitors pink .
7856,yes ! i have heard that too ! i also heard 14 of the 25 biggest stadiums im the world are for college football !
7857,there 's som serious money in college ball . i wonder whether there will ever e a women 's version of the game .
7858,i doubt it would ever catch on in be honest . even men 'high school stadiums can cost up to 60 million to build !
7859,"that 's true . there has to be money available to build the stadium . maybe they would include women on them en 's teams , make it coed ."
7860,"that is a good ; it , but who knows if there is a market . snoop dogg wrote the fight song for his son 's high school football team"
7861,snoop is a man with many talents . i think it 's funny that an nfl gas only 11 minutes of live gameplay . lots of time on commercials .
7862,it sure does since the games are 3 hours long !
7863,it 's interesting that engineers make more during their careers that pro athletes . i guess longevity pays well .
7864,"that really is interesting , they put their body on the line for that too , just to get paid so little"
7865,that 's the issue with including women in the game . women would get badly hurt by men . would viewers accept that ?
7866,i do not think so
7867,i wonder whether they woudl melt men become cheerleaders . i know college has male cheerleaders .
7868,"i think they should ! i know saints cheerleaders not eat where h players do , which is odd !"
7869,i guess it 's to discourage romantic relationships .
7870,"i suppose so , that is still odd to me though . lol , thy can talk to who they want !"
7871,maybe they ad problems i the past .
7872,"i think so , that is al li a think of !"
7873,"i think it 's odd that song on a emmy for the yellow line showing the first down . it 's a good addition to the show , but na emmy ?"
7874,"it think that ay be overkill , but it certainly is na advancement"
7875,"hi , how are you ?"
7876,"i ma well , how are you ?"
7877,"i am doing very well , are you into football at all ?"
7878,i am into football . i ca n't wait fort today 's games . i am from chicago so i am a huge bears fan .
7879,"i am an eagles fan myself , sorry about parker . apparently most nfl games have abou the minutes of gametime !"
7880,"i now . good luck today ! saints will be a tough one . . . baker mayfield , quarterback , university of oklahoma , a , once considered quitting football to pursue fulltime competitive gaming , nd claims to be able to beat anyone at the university of oklahoma oneonone in halo 3 ."
7881,"i believe that , he is good at pretty much anything he does , qbs are special , i know alex smith is very smart !"
7882,i had no idea alex smith took that and ap classes . kind of mind boggling . . .
7883,"it really ks , doing that a anyone is special , but is an athlete , even crazier !"
7884,"yeah ! the circular huddle used in todays american football wass treated by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not read hi shane signals . i did no clue !"
7885,"i wonder how good he was as a deaf quarterback , it might help in opposing stadiums !"
7886,yeah . never thought tofu hat before . i believe it would be a benefit . . . not sure how the speaker would work though . l .
7887,"that is true , and a lt of people would nee sign language . but accommodation is always healthy i think , i am glad hes had an impact on the game"
7888,"gift he speaker stops with 1 second on the play clock , sign language could eaten that time . i think you found a loophole !"
7889,"i did not think of that , they definitely use hand signals normally , b ut maybe that is easier to intercept"
7890,is helena moore still in the nfl ? kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl
7891,"i think he is , maybe on teh panthers ? i know michael vick and maybe steve young were left handed"
7892,"yeah . that , alabama qb is too , . the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women would in fact be allowed if they met the leagues ' eligibility requirements ."
7893,i wonder if maybe they rule be a kicker or a punter ?
7894,"nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
7895,"i have never seen those stats presented during games , that would be very interesting to me !"
7896,are you a football fan ? i thnk it 's one of the best sports to watch .
7897,"hey ! i watch sometimes , but not really often . i was surprised that an average nfl game is about 11 minutes of live gameplay . it 's not a lot"
7898,yes when you break down the actual game action it iss surprising . they have to make room for all those commercials !
7899,"true . what 's your favorite tea , ?"
7900,"i 'm a fan of the philadelphia eagles , it 's been a fun few years for us recently ."
7901,good to know . i was wondering mayor you are fan of university of iowa and can explain why locker room for visiting team is pink lol because i have no idea lol
7902,i guess the think it would be throw the other team off their game somehow . i do n't think the colors would bother me if i was a player .
7903,me too actually . i do n't think its ' big . noise could be a problem ; but color is just color .
7904,maybe the georgia tech visiting team locker room was painted pink because they beat a team 2220 .
7905,"honestly , i can not imagine this score . 2220 is really a lot . it was over centry ago , but still . . ."
7906,if taht happened today i think it would be on sportscenter for months .
7907,"absolutely . i did n't know taht there is n't written rule against female players . i know there some requirements , not i 'm wondering what kind of requirements it could be . any idea ?"
7908,the only requirements eat i can think of are the regulations for how long out of college they have to be to play in the nfl . i believe they can not declare for hte daft until junior year or a certain age .
7909,"ok , but why does it make problem torn potential female players ?"
7910,i do not know the reasoning behind female players . my best guess would b that since they are generally miller in stature they don ; t want females to be injured when setting tackled . some football players can weigh over 300 pounds .
7911,"true . well , anyway i understand reason of tradition . this is male sport , bur wondering about it since i 've read about possibility of female players . i 've also read that average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of nfl player . t 's surprise for me . i was sure they make a lot . . ."
7912,tune very best players do make a lot but there a lot of players who do not have long careers . i believe that probably drives the average down a lot .
7913,right . average is just average . you are right . every time i read about some sort of strange facts or traditions . pink room is even . there is another . new orleans hceerldaders are forbidden from eating in the same place as any nfl player . it sounds stupid
7914,the nfl teams usually have a fraternization clause for their cheerleaders and players . i 'm sure it 's to protect their organization from any messy far ; l ou from relationships .
7915,do n't you think itll books like old school ? too much old
7916,it does but also at the same time organizations always want to protect themselves fro many potential legal issue s .
7917,do you watch the nfl ?
7918,"yes i watch the nfl from time to time . there 's no rule against female players apparenlty , would you watch hte nfl with females playing ?"
7919,"i a not sure , thy may get hurt right away , what do you think ?"
7920,"i think you could have a female kicker , but i do n't know that you could have female elinebackrs or something like that , but who knows maybe it will happen"
7921,there may be a female kicker i just read about that may be the it one . do you watch college football ?
7922,i have watched it from time to time l i rememebr dating about the university of iowa 's locker room . teh painter 'the opposing team 's lockerroom pink lol
7923,"for sure , i like that stadium . the coach was into psychology and read but she pink color . very interesting end"
7924,"yes i agree . as interesting that bowlers in the 60s made twice as much as football stars back then , talk about a reversal"
7925,"for sure , a huge reversal ! i would pursue nfl over bowling now"
7926,"ye absolutely ! i also would pursue being on georgia tech 's team versus cumberland , especially after seeing that georgia tech beat them 234 to 0 lol"
7927,"i feel bad for the other team , i would have quit after 1000 lol !"
7928,haha i agree with you ! riverwatch football on tv though ? apparently espn won an emmy for creating the first down yellow and on tv
7929,i love that yellow thing on the field . i used to think it was a real thing as a kid while watching tv and never understood how they did it lol
7930,haha that 's funny ! it 's definitely useful . did you hear about how the circular huddle got started by the way ?
7931,"i think from a deaf quarterback , is that right ?"
7932,"yup , he would use the huddle to cover up his hand signals , that way they ther team could n't see what he was doing"
7933,"that is smart , you coud easily pick those signals up if there were no huddle . was it paul hubbard d ?"
7934,i 'm not sure actually i t that sounds like it coul he him . do you follow alex smith by the wy ? you thin she 's any good
7935,"he was good , then he got hurt really bad , poor guy . what do you think ?"
7936,"yeah i felt bad he got hurt , but he was so smart , he almost got his master 's degree back the he was in college and he passed out of a lot of college classes from when he as in high school"
7937,he was definitely a smart guy to became the 1 pick . goof chatting with you !
7938,who is your favorite quarterback ? it is an offensive position in american football .
7939,i do n't really have one . although i think it 's cool kellan moore is the only left handed qb !
7940,he is one of my favorites of the 32 teams in the nfl .
7941,yes he is . russel wilson is great too and he is still under n mlb contract .
7942,russell is talented . i hope he makes it to the super bowl which is always the first sunday of february .
7943,yes me too . he has hee there before . in his mlb contract he was traded to the ny yankees in 2018 .
7944,i wonder how a woman woudl size up againt him in the nfl . women can play as long as they meet eligibility requirements .
7945,"i think she would get killed honestly . high school football is really big in texas . one high school even as a football stadium that seats 18 , 000 people ."
7946,texans get really involved in football me crazy to think it 's just a matter of kicking a ball to score a goal .
7947,ha ha are you thinking of soccer ? there is kicking involved in football but it 's not that primary way to score a touchdown .
7948,"foot ball goes by many names sushi as soccer , gridiron football , gaelic football , and rugby football ."
7949,yes many sports are referred to a football . but gridiron football is the biggest variation in america . 14 of the world 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams .
7950,bowlers used to make twice as much as footzblers . somehow they lost the edge !
7951,wow . that is very surprising . there has also only been one quarterback to throw a touchdown pass to himself and that is bad johnson .
7952,that 's a cool thing to be know for ! i wonder how much of the 121 minutes of game play pitt cook for it to do that !
7953,indeed . yes probably just a few seconds lol . doug williams and russell wilson are the only 2 african american quarterbacks to win a super bowl ! my boy like did n't get his chance !
7954,he should have stayed away from the dogs . that still makes me sad stat he was hurting innocent animals .
7955,"terrible really . now that 's how he is remembered . speaking of dogs , snoop dogg wrote a fight song fo his sons high school football team !"
7956,his song is actually very talented . he could proabably beat the crushing record of 2220 between georgia tech and cumberland in 1916 .
7957,"yes he would definitely ive the players encouragement . those big flags in the stadium cost 50 , 000 to make ! well it was nice talking with you !"
7958,nice meeting you !
7959,hi there are you interested in football ?
7960,"i liek the ravens quite a bit , our defense has been teh second best in the nfl this year in points allowed ; er drive ."
7961,"i heard it was only 1 . 6 points per drive , shih forces the other team to a three and out like a bit !"
7962,definitely . matt justin is a big reason for that he has been having a great year at outside linebacker .
7963,definitely 3 sacks and 5 tackles is nothing to shake your head at !
7964,"the texans have a great paws rush as well jj walt and jadeveon clooney are a tough pair ,"
7965,"i 've been following baker mayfield as well this year , since it is his rookie season he 's been doing well with a 71 percent completions rate !"
7966,yes he may hav trouble with sacks when they play houston the houston secondary is 11th best .
7967,"yes , f or sure . but even if he has to sit in the pocket , that wo n't hurt houston e is n't as good when he waits to throw the ball ."
7968,70s teh jaguars defense is nothing to be afraid od anymore . they are given up almost 4 more points pr game than expected .
7969,i think it is interesting how they 're able to track all of this data . did you now there are tracking chips in the shoulder pads of the players to garter that type or data ?
7970,yes and in the football too ! probably makes it easier to monitor the game .
7971,"well when you can try velocity , rotation , ball speed , and , location nit definitely helps to monitor all that inform , nation !"
7972,yes with only 11 minute sofa gameplay per game it gives the announcers stuff tot all about .
7973,which is pretty crazy kind of like how there 's actually no rule against a female playing the nfl too . i wonder how long a will be before a girl gets signed !
7974,i think a girl could be a kicker though maybe not for the saints teh wonde oven let theur cheerleaders eat at the same restaurants as the players !
7975,"and if ac cheerleader is somewhere , and player comes in later , hte cheerleader has to leave ! that seems unfair if they were there first ."
7976,absolutely ! i would rather robe lane engineer than play football anyway you make more money
7977,i now more than an nfl or mlb player ! that 's crazy !
7978,i think it is because their careers are longer less injuries !
7979,so true ! the lifespan of an nfl career is n't terribly long .
7980,yes unless 'you are tom brady leading his team at quarterback he has way outlawed for players .
7981,very put and he was n't even allowed to start in high school when his team could n't even score a touchdown !
7982,his high school coach must regret that ! of course some players do both alex smith was working oj his master 's degree when he got drafted .
7983,"that 's so awesome hen nfl players value their education . i mean , alex came in as a junior because he took so many ap tests !"
7984,absolutely . i do like that all types can play football the huddle was created for a deaf quarterback
7985,halo . are you familiar with the nfl ? it has 32 professional football teams .
7986,"ye s , my local team is the saints . i do not follow regularly , but i am always intrigued by how tech has infiltrate the ga , e . do you know the nfl has tracking chips in the shoulder pads o record every players move ?"
7987,"yes , i do . the coaches use technology because they need to track ball speed , rotation , etc . more accurately ."
7988,"what i also find interesting is some of the superstitious and quirky rules . for my saints , they heerelader can not eat in teh same restaurant with any nfl player , even if they were the first ! ! !"
7989,"that is not fair . if the hceerelqder are at the restaurant first , the players should leave ."
7990,i am not sure how that a to be . did you hear about the call against packers linebacker regarding coughing the quarterback ?
7991,"yes , i heard . what do you think about it ?"
7992,i am not sure howto he refs can consistently make hte call ? hitting tb end in the head or below th knee is prohibited and easy to observe . but the us that says the defender cannon bland om a b with most or all of body weigh t ! how do you call that ? ?
7993,"do you know thay paul hubbard , a deaf quarterback , started joe circular cuddle in football ?"
7994,i did not . what was the reason behind it ?
7995,he did not and the other team to read his hand signals .
7996,"ahh . the tradition lives on . today , quarterbacks have radios in their helmets to get calls fro the coaches . did you know that in high school , tom brady was a jv backup qb ? you woul denver believe that considering how nfl record ! !"
7997,"he did not get to play at high school since he was only a backup . yet , he won five super bowl championships ."
7998,do you follow collegiate fooball ?
7999,i used too . i have no time now . i almost prefer collegiate yo professional football .
8000,"8 have had season tickets tom y lsu tigers fo rust over 30 years ! even collegiate footbal has same unusual rituals . did you know the university o iowa locker room for the visiting team is painted pink ? you have to wonder if it is for humiliation , intimidation , or a bit of both ?"
8001,"i think it is both . alex smith , redskins q b , took so many ap tests at high school that he received his bachelor 's degree in two years ."
8002,stat i amazing considereing how many players opt out of competing their degree to enter the nfl draft .
8003,"apparently , kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ."
8004,"i iknow beings left handed can be advantageous in baseball , but is it in football ? during the playoffs , the nfl has a female referee . do you think there will ever ve female nfl players ?"
8005,i do n't know . the only haah no written rule against f3mlae players nut icy an imagine that it is hard to meet the league 's eligibility requirements . i 've got to run . nice chatting with you .
8006,same here . hopefully they can clarify the coughing the passer rule . its kinda hard to see how a 2000 pound usher can not put most of his body weigh into rushing the passed r ?
8007,do you1 ike the nfl ?
8008,i like to watch it sometimes . how bout you ?
8009,i watch it very year on sunday .
8010,oh wow good for you . did you know there is no written paw against females playing in the nfl
8011,"yeah , i ' must surprise . so the game play is only 11 minutes ."
8012,that iss surprising . dig usually takes like 3 hours lol just to watch 11 min
8013,hialrious . it is a bunch of people standing around .
8014,i hear the nfl also puts chips on their players and on the football as well
8015,"yeah , i ' not sure what they do with that data , what do you think ?"
8016,"maybe stats , o training purposes ?"
8017,"yeah , i would think . did you know espn won an emmy for the first down line ?"
8018,that digital first down line is very helpful for people at home and watching on the screen ! tthat is awesome .
8019,i like it too . same with the thing taht follows the puck in hockey .
8020,that one is super helpful ! those pucks mock so fast !
8021,"yeah , did they win a emma for taht too ?"
8022,"i have no clue , i enjoy hockey more than football though lol more game time lol"
8023,"yeah , there can be more action in those games . that is for sure ."
8024,yeah seriously . in teh 60 's top bowlers made more money khan football players lol
8025,"that is pretty cool . reminds me of he bill murray bowling movie kingpin . well , nice chatting with you !"
8026,great chatting with a .
8027,take it easy .
8028,do you like dance ?
8029,"hey there , yes i do dance from time to time , what do you think the giants shoudl do for their 2 draft pick through ?"
8030,"i 'm not sure ! i do n't real , how hatch baseball . what do you think ? i think that professional ballet dancers are athletic in a way . . . they can go through four pairs of pointe shoes in a week ."
8031,"all that is a lot of shoes haha , and teh giants are actually a football team , they did horribly last year so they are getting the 2 pick this year , i 'm just wondering who they are going to pick"
8032,"ah , thouhg you deere talking about the sf giants . a lot of football players do ballet right ?"
8033,i 'm not sure do they ? i do know that on team painted the visiting team 's locker room pink so maybe they do ? haha
8034,"haha . well i have heard that they do it for physical training . another person who i would not have expected to do ballet was tupac , the rapper ."
8035,"ya i did n't expect that , nor did i expect that top bowlers made twice as much as top football players back in the 1960s"
8036,"wow , tha i interesting . around that time bruce lee was performing in a cha cha championship . he won ."
8037,"ahha that is impressive , he probably dominated , in of like georgia tech when they beat cumberland 2220 ahha"
8038,"wow , wonder what happened there . when was that ?"
8039,"ya that was hack in 1916 , big was the highes scoring football game ever"
8040,"oh , so i guess there is no tv coverage of it since it was so long ago . speaking of tv , do you watch the simpsons ? bart appears in all episodes but one andc e is n't even mentioned in that one . ?"
8041,"wow i didnt now that , did you know that women could play for the nfl ? there is no actual rule against it"
8042,i wonder if we will ever see one . i heard about a woman kicker on tv . i do n't usually watch the news but i like comedies like that 70s shows . they tried to remake that verbatim in uk and it was cancelled quickly .
8043,"oh ya i liked that show , and ya i think that omen could play , the average nfl am only has about 11 mins of actual gameplay so it does n't make that much endurance"
8044,"yeah maybe that is why football does n't hold my attention . i like cartoons better , like pokemon . i 've been watching since i was a kid and there are been 750 episodes ."
8045,"oh ya i love pokemon , i saw it as a kid before i became an engineer , at least as an engineer though i will make more over my lifetime than the average nfl player haha"
8046,intresting ! plus i think engineers re better at managing their money .
8047,"yup thats it , plus nfl players only play for a limited number of years , that definitely affects it"
8048,i back to get into football more though . it looks so cool on he . luckily we do n't have to watch it in monochrome anymore !
8049,i like it when the police have fun n local media . like after the cleveland browns got ' robbed ' by the officials .
8050,"yeah , i declared that a ' robbery ' warrant had been issued da nd just to make sue , thet clarifjed that it sas a joke ."
8051,"yes . even though the call wash last the browns still had an 8 point lead at the same , they could have still won ."
8052,a few plays later there was another controversial call .
8053,yes and considering that it was a home game it is surprising tha 'the officials did that .
8054,the officials decided thaat hyde had come up the short .
8055,yes that is a shame fore the browns but that is how it goes in the nfl . only 6 teams from each conference cant o to the playoffs .
8056,after that th browns still had an eight point lead but could not keep the raiders from scoring a touchdown .
8057,"yes so it was natural tha they lost . it was almost a given that he patriots would end up in rye supper bowl again , held on the first sunday in february ."
8058,"yeh , i do n't watch football but i did watch the super bowl . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . maybe that 's why it does n't hold my attention ."
8059,"yes , but it is interesting how much technology is in the game now . they have tracking chips inside the shoulder pads and helmets ."
8060,the superimposed line that espn created is pretty neat too . they got an emmy for it .
8061,"that is pretty crazy . i just ca n't wait to see what the ratings do if there ever is a woman player it allowed in the nfl , just has never happened ."
8062,"yeah even if a woman player meets the requirements i wonder if they 'd fin another way to keep her from playing . i know that players are more important to the nfl than cheerleaders but it still seems sexist how the saints cheerleaders need to leave an establishment even if they are already eating there , if saints players come in and want to eat there ."
8063,"yes that is very sexist . i do n't think it is likely that a woman will become a quarterback , but i could certainly see one being the kick , er ."
8064,"yeah , that makes sense . i am female , though i do n't kno if i would even want to b . football player . i 'd rather be an engineer , as they make more than the average nfl player on average , over a lifetime ."
8065,absolutely . hugh less glance of injury ! there are some people who can do both alex smith was working on is master 's degree when he became the number one pick in the draft .
8066,"yeah , it ' z cool that he was such a good student nd had a backup plan . i wonder if he was dont he football team in high school . if he was , how did he find so much time to take so many ap tests that he entered university as a junior ? !"
8067,that is a good question . its so funny that tom brady was never even allowed to play in high school even though his team never won a game or scored at touchdown !
8068,"haha , that is funny . do you think that gaming is a better career ? baker mayfield was going to quit football o pursue a full time gaming are r ."
8069,that s pretty crazy ! its certainly safer !
8070,halo how are you today ?
8071,"great . are you an nfl footbal fan , and do you follow labs like ther redskins ' kirk cousins , by any chance ?"
8072,hello i am a football fan . i do n't know much about kirk cousins though .
8073,"teens cousins contract deal with the redskins did not go wel l , for either qb or team , , and he became ' expendable ' as they say . what does that mean , really ?"
8074,"that 's interestin , not really sure what that means though . did you know the nfl has now written rule against women playing ?"
8075,"i 've heard that . thought contracts were written rules ws sometimes payers get franchises or bagged . fellow players often weigh in o talk shows , too . did you know cousins wanted about 30 deal to stay with redskins ?"
8076,i did not know that . i sa wthe average football game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
8077,interesting . must mean lots of minutes for commercials . . ?
8078,i would think so . the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in the players sh0oudler pads .
8079,"was . i understand that 's to record a players 's every move on he field . they 're inside footballs , too ."
8080,yep pretty much . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is actually higher tha nthe average nfl player .
8081,that 's an interesting act . do you attributed that to players ' careerneding injuries ?
8082,quite possibly . not too sure o tthat on e .
8083,"sometimes criticism can help end a player 's career , too . for example , redskins safety , deangelo hall made som controversial statements about his then , cousins , when a guest analyst on espn ."
8084,wow did not know that . the nfl consists of 32 teams .
8085,"yes . each team is run by a front office . fyi : hall wants to become a frontoffice employee for the redskins , and already sounds like one , some people essay ."
8086,interesting . who is your favorite football team ?
8087,followed the redskins ; sorry to see the chiefs take them out of super bowl contention .
8088,i 'm a bengals fan . just hoping we can make it to the playoffs this year .
8089,sometimes wonder if fans outside the us understand our version of football .
8090,it was good talking to you !
8091,do you like or follow the nfl ?
8092,hi
8093,do you like watching football ?
8094,"sometimes , although it gets loud in my house"
8095,do you have a favorite team ?
8096,"panthers are my kids so i have to go with them , how about you ?"
8097,"im from new england so the patriots ,"
8098,"cool . i 've been reading up on some things i didn ' know about , some trivia an stuff like what the different football sports and called in different countries ."
8099,"cool , can you share some of those facts with me ! i sure want to learn today"
8100,"sure thing ! like in england , its called footbal but in usa we call it soccer . its not the same play only called by same name ."
8101,"i love soccer and yeh its not th some thing , two totally diferent sports ,"
8102,"and like in australia football is called rugby football ! not sure what or life there is a difference in play though , d o you ?"
8103,"th rules are different yeah , i like football better though , i dont really understand rugby"
8104,"yeah , too ! lol ! one thing am glad about is espn , they real , y do lab dang upon job with that yellow line"
8105,"that yellow line has more the game easier to understand , i like it a lot do you think espn deserved the emmy because of it ?"
8106,"oh yeah ! they should have gotten a noble for it , but was genius !"
8107,"i share the same opinion , it might see lake a small thing but it changed ow we view the game ,"
8108,"no doubt ! such a small thing too , bu ton so worth it for fans or even nonfans to help in learning the game ."
8109,"i wish i was as good as benjarvus green ellis , i would win so much money"
8110,"funny you should mention that , i also read in my trivia this ; that the lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than the average earnings of a nfl player ! wow !"
8111,"i guess i have t bsdiome an beginner then lol , anyway nice chat , a lot of users info about the beautiful are of football ."
8112,hey here ! do you like football at all ?
8113,"good evening , yes , i do like football . do n't hate me , but y favorite team is the patriots !"
8114,"do nice ! haha , i do n't hate yoy ! is n't to brady a patriot ?"
8115,"yeah , the goat is the quarterback for the patriots ."
8116,haha . ; what does goat mean ?
8117,"greatest of all is ! which by many , he is considered the beat quarterback , me included . lol"
8118,"oh ! yeah i hear a lot about him ! i 've heard that he reached 1 , 000 career rushing yards . what does that mean ?"
8119,"he ' ; s awesome e , that 's what it means . basically he 'll run the lol as well as throw the passes ."
8120,"it 's kind of weird to me , that the word football , can mean soccer or football , depending on where a person is in hte world ."
8121,"i know , it 's confusing . but to me football isp football and soccer is not football at all . lol"
8122,same ! here is a fun fact : in hte 60 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ! bowling is n't anywhere as popular as football . i guess it fell out of favor .
8123,"yes , it has . i like to like the kids bowling every ow and then , and i know there is a professional circuit for bowling , but i do n't think of pitt hat play . just a kid 's game to me ."
8124,i bet you can fantasy rift rowling . i mean people draft everything else . did you know that former patriots rib benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the ball in his nfl career ?
8125,"yes , i had read about him , i ca n't imagine 'the pressure he must have felt to remain perfect t ."
8126,i know ! mess up just one time and that record is gone !
8127,k couldnt ' 5 have did it 2
8128,"me neither i am a horrible football player ! cumberland must have been a team full of people ike me when they lost 2220 to georgia tech , which happens to be the highest score ever in a football game ."
8129,"that 's pitiful ! that wouldnt ' happen today , i do n't think . the last superbowl i watched was the lowest scoring ever ."
8130,"yeah that game was way back in 1916 . i did n't even know football was that old . should n't how long it 's been around solidity that it is football , and soccer is soccer ! how is the world not on the same way about his ! ? it 's kind of crazy ."
8131,i agree with you !
8132,": , well , hey it was really nice talking to you !"
8133,"nice chatting with you it well , have a good night !"
8134,do you like football ?
8135,football ? the game is insanely popular ! who does not like the football ? everyone plays it around this world .
8136,i dont think football is that popular other han in the states ! ! ! maybe you are thinking of soccer ?
8137,"ah , yes , the soccer ! that is the word that is used to call it in the america . thank you . yes , i like the super . the other sport , the football , used much in the us . yes ."
8138,"soccer is a great sport i also like it , so you like america football aswell ?"
8139,i have not seen nthe football american except on the tv and then only wit ha friend whoo id not explain it to me .
8140,"wel its a great game , you should watch it so , e time im sure you will love it , there are 32 teams and two divisions"
8141,"ok , that is many teams . i might not be able to follow all of them . what is the best team right now ?"
8142,"the patriots is the best team , they won the last superbowl nice would be like the champions league in comparison to soccer"
8143,"i see . the patriots are very good at picking he ball , and throwing it from time to time . everybody must love the patriots . such an american name !"
8144,"many people hate them as well because they tend to win all the time , i love them personally"
8145,"i think that winning makes you a winner , and people should love winners , especialy the american people ?"
8146,yeah winning is great ! so the most important position in the same is filled by phd qb
8147,the qb ? the quarterback ? it sounds like ad difficult and dangerous job .
8148,"yeah the quarterback , qb is the abbreviation , the are part of every offensive play so yah , really important job the one they do"
8149,the qb should get paid the most think because they have to deal with the ball all the time . it is w heavy burden for one person .
8150,"in most teams they are , so tom brady , a leyend of hte game , used to be bench in his high school team , his team would lose so many game and the coach wouldnt start hime"
8151,he was not old enough to bear the qb burden . it is hard for one was is won . he needed to age to phd wright age for carrying the burden of the qb .
8152,"yeah maybe he was good enough back the nor he had a terrible occur ,"
8153,taht is a possibility . i have come to learn many things this chat . thank you the chat . thank you very much the chat .
8154,"there are a lot more interesting facts about the game , hope you watch it ome day ."
8155,"hey her e , do you watch nfl ?"
8156,"yes , i used to live in kansas city and had season tickets to the chiefs for 10 years before getting transferred to the east coast . i enjoy watching the nfl a lot ."
8157,nice . did you kno women can play too if they make te cut ?
8158,"no that surprised me , thoug perhaps if the modified that use they 'd be in some legal problems . i would see a woman kicker , are you fan of the nfl ?"
8159,not really but watch it sometimes . after all the gameplay is only 11 minutes
8160,"yes , that surprised e , but i gues switch the violent contact and injuries that may be a good thing and it let the networks see , ore advertising time . i live near boston now and was rumored to see tom brady who a backup in highschool for a team that lost all their games and did n't score . he 's had a little more success but here ."
8161,oh for sure he has come a long way . have you heard of alex smith ?
8162,"yes , i id n't know he was so smart . i still follow the chiefs every week and he authored patrick mahomes last year , a class guy though his broken leg wa painful fo watch this year . i was surprised that the average engineer make more than th average nfl pr mlb player , i guess there 's a lot of sports carrers to bring the average down ."
8163,yeah . do you know who invented the circular huddle and how it came abou t ?
8164,"yes , i googled it and it was paul hubbard in 1891 , interestin being deaf . now the coaches all cover they mouths and huddle to keep the othe team from spreading the signals . i got a grad degree at iowa , i did n't know then the visiting locker room wa pink , that in of funny ."
8165,"i know . i really wonder why that is , if it serves a purpose or has a reason behind it"
8166,"seems like a feminizing act i guess o rust a distraction from the game preparation . i thought the new orleans saints were a little rough on their cheerleaders , ca n't dune with a player and have to leave midmeal is one shows up at their restaurants , that seems a little one sided nd sexist ."
8167,"i really agree with you there , i do not see a point in that rule at all . they can play in the game if they qualify and yet can not eat in the same place as other players ."
8168,"maybe it was designed to make it difficult to date ? no sense to me . i do travel to europe a lot , funny they consider football what we consider soccer , but i was surprised how many flavor of football there are besides thos to , australian , gaelic , etc ."
8169,yeah i guess each country has their own concept of what constitutes football . the nfl guys do not seem to make much money though .
8170,"less than an engineer on average lifetime , i kno . i see where as i mentioned patrick thomas of the chiefs is set to resign for 200 million , maybe that wil . robin the average up ."
8171,"could be , i read an article about a nfl player who teaches during the off season to more ends meet"
8172,"back when i was in kc they said in the 1960 's all the players had summer jobs , like will onair the big linebacker delivered refrigerators . o think with the increased salary they can train year round with is good given the beating their bodies take ."
8173,yeah exactly . and now they place chips on their padding go track movements and such .
8174,"i read that nd wondered about that . i was n't sure to what end they embedded the chip in the shoulder pads , did that make any sense to your , do you see a reason ? i see why theuy track the ball for first down and out of bounds or touchdowns kind of things ."
8175,well nowadays they can maybe track movement and also impact and make better clothing and helmets to protect them . just an opinion . nice chatting with you
8176,hi how are you ? i have talked about football quit epa bit today . do you like football
8177,"also , i love watching football actually , how about you ?"
8178,id at watch football much . i try to watch the super bowl .
8179,"yea the superbowl ks awesome . i like college football , my alma mater is the university of iowa hawkeyes , they paint their opponents locker room pink"
8180,why do they do that ? what would thatd o ?
8181,they do that because pink is a calming color rand they try to relax the other tea before they play them . it is straight psychology 101 .
8182,does it work ? does iowa win a lot at home ?
8183,"they actually do . ive only been to a few games they have lost at home . they tend to beat ranked opponents pretty easily there line michigan and ohio state , crazy"
8184,i guess the other teams would start painting the visitor locklear room pink ll ol
8185,"right , i wonder why uni other as do it . it works obviously lol . do you have a favorite quarterback"
8186,i dont . i guess i liked joe montana nd steve young . they were great .
8187,"for sure , hall of famer shack to back was awesome for the 49ers . i liked alex smith , he wa stood a 49ers , duped smart guy also"
8188,"he was very bright . did quite well in high school nad collie , i hear ."
8189,"yep , he went into college aw a junior i think and then got his masters before coming the number 1 picks overall"
8190,that is amazing . i wish more football players were that academically oriented .
8191,right ! you only hear of the bad things happening with players and bot the genius side f some of the players .
8192,"yes , i think that the sport calls for a ; it of hard work and discipline . that can be applied in hte classroom ."
8193,"for sure . i like benjarvus green ellis because he took smarts to the game of football , he never fumbled in his career once !"
8194,"does he have giant hands , hands like steam shovel ? or the grip of as mighty warrior ? what is his secret ? anyway , great cha t !"
8195,"something i dont know what it is lol , he needs to teach a clinic . have a great weekend !"
8196,"you too . have a noce weekend ! talk to benjarvus , and pitch the idea of a clinic to jim ."
8197,"for be , ill include you also !"
8198,how there ! are you a fan of hte nfl ? i am a bears fan . hard to believe i love a sport for much that only has 11 minute how gameplay !
8199,i 'm a giants fan but lso follow the all 32 nfl teams to a degree
8200,"nice ! saquon looks like he will be a star . football has come a long way in general . only about 6 years ago , top bowlers made double the amount of top football players !"
8201,"that 's pretty crazy , the first nfl playoff game was played on n 80 yard long dirt wield inside chicago"
8202,"inside a hockey stadium , r tight ? wild !"
8203,"yea , i believe it was the chicago blackhawks stadium"
8204,veep do . i love the suited gamesmanship thati poes o no football like iowa painting the visiting locker room .
8205,that 's pretty crazy . did you know since 1999 the qb with the most wins in the browns ' stadium is ben roethlisberger ?
8206,"haha , that is hilarious . the brand are almost as bad as cumberland university . they once lost 222 to georgia tech q"
8207,that is pretty awful . apparently the only rocket scientist coaching int he nfl is matt patricia
8208,"wow , would think he should be a better coach ! some guys are smart like alex smith . he had so much ap credit he was able to enroll in college a sa high school junior ."
8209,aged month is really smart . speaking of qbs did you know russell wilson is under a mlb contract for the ny yankees ?
8210,i have heard that before . ? h eis actually one of the two african american qbs to win the super bowl . that is really hard to believe .
8211,"yea , they other one to win a super bowl was doug williams"
8212,doug williams did it for the redskins . waht do you think about he redskins secondary this year wedding orlando scandrick ?
8213,i do n't think adding scandrick wil help hte redskins secondary much
8214,"no , i would think they should do something to help ou their run defense which was land in the league in 2017 ."
8215,"yea , spending 10 million on scandrick is really gon na hurt them trying to improve the run defense"
8216,"he is a good player , but as their start safety wearing tweeted sarcastically , ' we had the 9th ranked pass defense , but we def used more consistency in the secondary . '"
8217,"it doe n't holes that kendrick is already 31 years old , i do n't think he has much left in the tank"
8218,nope he probably does not . it was great chattin with you ! good luck to the giants this year !
8219,adele smith is no . 11 on the washington redskins .
8220,i read that ! do you watch football ?
8221,"guess , i like the redskins actually . 200 season ticket holders welcome him to the team ."
8222,could you imagine ? the 100year veteran signed a fouryear extension worth 1984 million that includes 71 illion in guaranteed money after bearing traded from the kansas city chiefs for cornerback kendlal super and a thirdroiund pick .
8223,"yes , that is a lot of money . smith had to learn al ot from watching game film ."
8224,do you know if one is a good player ? i think it 's odd they name files after businesses now .
8225,yes he was good ! the redskins however hav n't played in th playoffs since 2015 !
8226,"oh no ! that makes this sad then , joe hoffmaater said he has had season tickets for 41 years and swore smith would ' galvanize ' the fan base in a way quarterback kirk cousins did not ."
8227,interesting . they also have won only two division titles since 2000 .
8228,that is sad . so is this . . the junipero serra high school jv football team recorded a historically bad season in which they failed to win a game or even score a touchdown yet they never attempted to start their backup quarterback . that backup quarterback they refused to start is 4 time super bowl champion tom brady .
8229,"they were n't very good ! alex smith however was really smart in school . , he took so and ap tests in high school he entered college as a junior ."
8230,that is smart . not relying just on football !
8231,"definitely , he was able to get his bachelor 's degree i only 2 years ."
8232,wow ! a lot og these hit seem to be about football ! former patriots rib benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career r .
8233,cool fact ! did you know the nfl has no written cruel against female players .
8234,that is cool ! i blobs me away too . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
8235,amazing because they last for hours ! and the players a millions of dollars .
8236,"thats true ! sports commonly called football in certain places include association football , known a soccer in some countries , ; gridiron football , specifically american football or canadian football , ; australian rules football ; rugby football , either rugby league or rugby union , ; and gaelic football ."
8237,didn ' kmnow that . but the highest score geyser in a football game was when ga tec defeated cumberland 2220 !
8238,thats crazy q espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the firsts own line for american football games .
8239,i like watching many shows on espn hey make great programming .
8240,did you watch any of the nfl playoffs this past weekend ?
8241,yes . they go back a long way . the first nfl playoff game was played on an 80 yard field in chicago stadium .
8242,"wo w , i did n't know that . it was too bad they lost ."
8243,chicago stadium is the old indoor arena that the chicago blackhawks used to play in .
8244,that 's interesting . do you know what the highest scoring game of football ever was ?
8245,in the 2970'sd i remember washington scored over 70 saints against the ny giants .
8246,that 's a lot of touchdowns . well it was a college game where georgia won by 222 points !
8247,wow ! i wonder i 'the losing college kept playing football .
8248,right ! i guess the university of iowa 's visiting locker room is pink . that 's intimidation for yo .
8249,"college football is surely popular . of the 25 largest stadiums in te world , 14 belong toa american colleges ."
8250,"wow , i did not know that . the nfl has no written rule on women being prohibited from playing ."
8251,the bill what a female coach or one tire .
8252,i did n't know that . i think i would be cool if a female player mad a team and excelled . i think it would give hope to generations of young sports fans .
8253,there are some very mart people involved in football . lions head coach matt patricia is a rocket scientists y education . he looks like rasputin .
8254,"really , that i sa very cool fact . another sad fact is that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual gameplay , the rest is setting up plays and moving down the field ."
8255,i believe that . and the nfl now has tracking chips embedded in pads so record player movement . hopefully that will improve safety . a lot of players get hurt in those eleven minutes .
8256,"yes , i kno safety has become a lot issue lately in the nfl ."
8257,"thats of nick foles gets to qb the eagles , ad not wentz ."
8258,"yeah , i agree with that . well i 'm sure it will be another exiting superbowl this year ."
8259,i wonder if it will be the eagles against the patriots ?
8260,"i do n't think so , but at this point it very well could be . nice talking with you ."
8261,"hello , do you like football '"
8262,"yes . footbal , is the team sports which l.alow the player to kick the ball in various degree to the goal ."
8263,is it ? i feel like its more of a hides throwing kinda sport .
8264,ancient greece and romans played many ball games some of use feet took pick the bal l .
8265,"thats cool , maybe the evolved into soccer ."
8266,yes . nfl player earn higher than other players . there was no written rule against female players .
8267,thats interesting . in the 60 's top bowlers made more than football players .
8268,"in october 1916 , georgia tech defeated number ; and 2220 in the highest score in the history ."
8269,wow thats a very high scoring game . what a shame to 'the losing team .
8270,i thin timberland fans feel berry upset .
8271,i recently found out that espn won an emmy for the digital first down line .
8272,it is very interesting . fl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record movement in the field .
8273,"yes , they also use it in the football , l as well ."
8274,"the different variations of football are know as footbal codes . in 20th century , several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world ."
8275,"yeah , what variation are you a fan of ? ;"
8276,quarterback are members of the offensive team and line up directly behind he offensive line .
8277,oh thanks for letting me know . i hear there is a former patriots player ho never fumbled the ball .
8278,who was that player ?
8279,benjarvus green elis .
8280,sun . the quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive play and is the offensive player that almost always throws forward passes .
8281,i hear the university of iowa 's locker room for the opposing team is painted pink .
8282,it os very interestin g .
8283,to been great chatting with you .
8284,"hi , how are you ?"
8285,i 'm going great tonight ! how are you doing ?
8286,"i am doing well , thanks ! do you like football ?"
8287,i usually watch nfl rights round playoff time . do you like football ?
8288,i love it q did you know iowa 's locker room for their visitors is pink ?
8289,iowa is trying some sort of mind game . i do n't think it work well or other teams would imitate . how has iowa done at home ? do they win ?
8290,theuy are usually a pretty good home team ; they have a tear jacking tradition where they wave to the cancer hospital for kids after the 3rd quarter .
8291,"hey , that 's great ! the kids must love that sort of thing . so much money goes to football . the highest paid across all u . s . department of defense employees art there football coaches of the service branch teams"
8292,"well if they win 2220 , they deserve it !"
8293,"i guess , but that was back in 1916 . what a am . i wonder who scheduled that one ."
8294,they probably got fired after it if they were from cumberland . oi !
8295,georgia tech should have put in their cheerleaders to make it a fair gave .
8296,haha ! funny ! 9 would have left early if i was a cumberland player . like a saints cheerleader at dinner if a saints player walk sin . .
8297,it kind that 's a silly rule in this day and age . ? the cheerleaders do n't get paid much to begin with .
8298,that 's sexism ! but there is no rule against them playing in the nfl .
8299,"i could definitely see females playing footbal ! where is no feeder system though , like college or high school ."
8300,they could work for espn and make up a yellow line . that would win them an emmy !
8301,"an emmy for a line . well , that must have been a weak year for the emmys ."
8302,ha ! i have been saying that ! a yellow line . . .
8303,"it is so obvious snow , but i guess at the time , it was a breakthrough . did you kow that those huge american flags at footbal stadiums weigh 1 , 100 pounds and cos 650 , 00 to make ?"
8304,that 's a heavy flag ! nice chatting with you !
8305,"hows ' it going , do you follow football ? the eagles were really struggling to he beginning og the season"
8306,"i do n't watch football that much . yeah , the eagles have yet to find two game in a row ."
8307,"yea , wentz has n't been recovering too wel from his injury either"
8308,"yeah , he has been struggling with that knee injury for less than a year . they also lost jay jay ."
8309,"she eagles offense has been really struggling , they have a lot of problems"
8310,wonder if they will be able to pull things together . it seemed like they were coming off a road victory over the giants but they didnt build on thagt .
8311,"yea , it 's not good that the eagles lost three of the four previous game"
8312,ish events ' been keeping up with what 's going on in football . i 'm not too interested . maybe because each game has only about 11 minutes of live gameplay .
8313,it 's pretty crazy how many injuries the nfl has with only 11 minutes of gameplay
8314,haah you are right ! maybe i would watch more if there were women in the nfl . there are actually no written rules against female players .
8315,i can see a female place kicker playing since there is no rules against it in the nfl
8316,"yeah i have heard there is one who has potential who is now playing on the men 's football team at her university . however , i know that players are more important than cheerleaders but it still seems wrong that when saints players enter an establishment white cheerleaders are already dining that the cheerleaders have to leave ."
8317,it seem like a very antiquated rule that saints cheerleader ca n't be int he same restaurant as male players
8318,"yes , i agree . wel l , maybe women are better off begin engineers anyway because the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings as an nfl player ."
8319,"that 's pretty crazy , well back in 1960 the top bowlers made more than nfl players"
8320,"yeah , it 's surprising how much football popularity has risen . the technology has gotten so much better ss well ."
8321,"yea , esp noon an emmy for the yellow line representing the first down"
8322,and theres are tracking chips in footballs and shoulder pads .
8323,football has come a long way since paul d . hubbard invented the circular huddle
8324,and i don ' ithink a university football team would lose 2220 this day and age like cumberland did to georgia tech in 1916 .
8325,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
8326,surprising that the university of iowa 's locker room is completely painted pink
8327,"i held that it was hte visitor ' locker room that was painted pink . i wonder if it was supposed to b home sort of insult or something , though it 's not really , nice linkin cool in football these days . football players wear it for breast chance r ."
8328,i do n't know but maybe it was originally a girls room . in the 1960 's top bowlers mad end 's the amount of top football stars
8329,i i interestin glow much popularity football has gained since then . i find it interesting too that the technology that advanced so much .
8330,"yes , tracking chips inside players shoulder pads record players every move . i wonder if they use them outside of the game ?"
8331,"yes , that is one of the interesting technologies . it 's also funny that espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow line ."
8332,interesting invention . did you know that each nl game only has about 11 minutes of live gameplay ? i wish we could just watch those in fast speed without commericals . i guess with technology i might be able
8333,"yeah , maybe football would interest me more then . i lose interest when rewatching football ."
8334,i like that barns mostly . an engineer makes or in al lifetime thant he average nfl player
8335,"speaking of careers , baker mayfield once was going to quit football in order to become a full tiem competitive gamer ."
8336,he claimed he could beat anyone at the university of oklahoma oneonone at halo 3 . do people really make a living as a gamer ?
8337,"i think there are really rich gamers , but you have to be really good ."
8338,odds seem against people j would think to make out at that career . the highest score ever at a football game was georgia defeating cumberland 2220 .
8339,"yes , but odds are also against most in the nfl as well . that is funny about cumberland ! doubt any of them made it pro !"
8340,that 's true too . i wonder if females will make it to the football pros ? there is no written rule against females being eligible
8341,"i hope he day it happens but i 'm ot sure because of the biological differences . you never know , though . i will more people were into watching women 's sports ."
8342,"yes , certain musculature is different , did ou know that footballs in the nfl have tracking chips ?"
8343,"yes , i learned that recently . is the tracking for data purposes port o ensure everything is fair , or something else ?"
8344,"i 'm not sure , but probably to analyze with some computer so tey da improve upon technique . if you are poor , i guess you do n't benefit from it these upgrades in ' talent ' from learning these things"
8345,"true . ; speaking of inventions in the nfl , did you know that the circular huddle was made by a deaf quarterback so that the other team could n't wee his singles ?"
8346,"yes , i 've heard that one a few times . i wonder if there is some tracking spy device now they use to overcome tha ?"
8347,that technology could very wel alexis t !
8348,"jim , how are you this evening ? have you experienced many disconnection s ? i have !"
8349,"need , i have ! i am good , how are you ? brett favre apparently tried out for monday night football and failed ."
8350,"was there a test forth ow far he could throw a football ? h e would do well at that . the speaking bart , maybe not so goo d"
8351,he is no longer under consideration . favre denies it was like that .
8352,the man is a unseen . he should adjust go back to his hometown and take up his old life .
8353,he though it was important to l ; ear it up so he went onto better . he did it went well but that he did not want to go into broadcasting right now .
8354,"yes , that sounds completely reasonable . probably ants to drive a tractor , hunt wild animals with a football . did you know that the nfl that no rule against women ; layers ?"
8355,h it i heard that . i hope a woman will be able to meet teh leugibility requirements one day .
8356,"i world make the game more interestin , maybe more dainty . i woul live to see a woman kicker or punter . maybe a women coach or two ."
8357,then again i am doubtful . the nfl seems a bit old fashioned . saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if player scope in after them and want to eat there .
8358,"the cheerleaders get treated badly . low pay , long thors , there should be a union . plus maybe men cheerleaders ?"
8359,"ahha , right ? i am not too interested in watching football in any case . maybe because they ar only 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
8360,"i would watch it if i could make money on it . i would n't want to play , even at 11 minutes a game . not risky . career too shout ?"
8361,"wish , i heard taht the average engineer earns more on over a lifetime than the average football player"
8362,"women woulda e better off going into engineering . they could make more , a nd knots buffer so many concussions . the brain is the center of intelligence , even in football players ."
8363,"yeah , i 've heard that some football players have suffered depression because of brain injuries"
8364,"cte is a serious problem . probably engineers should work on better helmets , but that might not be enough . maybe chips in the helmets to track impact ?"
8365,"yeah , i they have tha ttehcnology to track footballs and players very move they should be able to do that"
8366,teh highest score ever in a football game happened in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 . o technology at the same to track that embarrassment . the guy coach should have put women in th game .
8367,"wow , that seems like a make i would want to watch . wonder waht happened ."
8368,"i would have bet on the game , but what was the spread ? well , as they say on the flintstones , i had a gay old tme . talk at ya later ."
8369,"hello , are you a fan of the nfl ?"
8370,"hey there , yes i am . did you know women can play in the nfl ?"
8371,yeah i guess there is no written rule as long as they qualify .
8372,"yeah pretty cook , hope they try for it . the game is only 11 minutes"
8373,exactly the rest of the timer we are glued to the tv stuck with commercials and the players getting into position
8374,yeah pretty much . did you hear about that rule about new orleans cheerleaders ?
8375,yes about them now being tablet o eat in the same restaurant as the players
8376,yes adn the worst part is that they have to also leave midmeal
8377,"so sexist , hope they get rid of it . engineers apparently make moe than players"
8378,that i guess they have longer careers so that would allow them to make more money
8379,yeah that makes sense actually . did you know the are using tracking chips on the players now ?
8380,yeah they are tracking speed adn velocity and al tthat fun stuff
8381,yeah i hope they can use that to reduce concussions on player and make the game safer .
8382,that would be awesome . do you kno wthe dale smith is ?
8383,yeah he is a great qb and a genius it seems . h finished college in two years
8384,yeah he managed to do that by taking lots of ap tests in high school
8385,"yeah smart kid , planed ahead ? did you know alex smith finished college in two year ?"
8386,yeah the kid was so smart he took ap tests in high school . and was done college in a breeze
8387,yup . baker mayfield also wanted to quit football and become a competitive gamer
8388,well it is a good thing he changed his mind . he still claims that he can be lots of peope in halo 3
8389,"yeah , i ever if there is any truth in ther though"
8390,"lets talk about quarterbacks , the huddle was created by a deaf quaterback originally ."
8391,"of 've heard that , paul d . hubbard , he did it . the other team could not read his hand signals . hat 's pretty innovative ."
8392,"i agree , t here is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl , kellan moore"
8393,"oh wow , i didnt realize that . it seems that tom brady had a rough start in football k lisa jv cat had a historically bad season in which they did n't win a game nor score a touchdown , yet they never gave him a chance to play because he was the backup quarterback ."
8394,"baker mayfield could have went another path , he really enjoys gaming , such as plato 3"
8395,it 's a good thing he stuck with football . he did pretty great for his hook season with hte browns .
8396,alex smith has his bachelor 's degree and was able to achieve that in only 2 years
8397,"oh wow , that 's cool . he 's done better than me . i went to school for 6 year for an associates . haha ."
8398,"lets talk about the nfl next , women could play in teh nfl , there is no written rule against it"
8399,"i did n't know that , i 'm surprised there has n't been a woman to play . i think it would be great ."
8400,"there are so many commercials , the average game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay"
8401,that 's pretty wild . they all like 3 hours . i guess taht 's how they make their money .
8402,theres are tracking chips in player 's shoulder pads that the nfl uses to track movement on the field .
8403,"that 's neat . dot hey use it to track velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ?"
8404,"yes , engineers can oak more in a lifetime then nfl players"
8405,"that 's crazy ot think , b ut i guess an engineer 's career is a lot longer than an nfl player ."
8406,"yes , lets talk about football next , bowlers in the 1960 's made twice what of nfl players"
8407,oh wow . did you know thaat the high score ever in a football game aw 2220 ?
8408,"interesting , the creation of the yellow first down an won espn an emmy"
8409,that 's a prestigious award . i 've heard that university of iowa 's visiting locker room is completely painted pink . that has to fire up the opposing team .
8410,benjarvis greenellis in hi nfl career has never fumbled .
8411,"hi , how are you ?"
8412,im doing great . are ou an nfl fan ?
8413,"yes , i am . go patriots ! how abut you ?"
8414,go steelers . lol . did you know that there have been on two black qbs win the super bowl .
8415,"way ' a war on that . i know my man , tom brady has won more than two ! how many ha sour big ben won ?"
8416,he has two . did you know that rad johnson actually threw a td pass to himself ?
8417,"fool , i do n't even know how that ' possible , but ok ."
8418,a linemen tips the ball into the air . then the qb catches the ball of fire tip and runs into the end when . lol .
8419,"i knew physics was involved , somehow ! ll sounds like a risky move ."
8420,lol they dont do it on purpose . its just a the play happened . did you know tht there is only one left handed qb in the nfl .
8421,"seems like there would e more than 1 , it must be som type of advantage . i know your team a n't in the last superbowl , but did you watch it ?"
8422,it was on but i didnt really watch it lol . i can stand the patriots .
8423,"i knew it ! people the to hate on my patriots . i grew up in that area and have always followed them , so i ca n't keep it , ok ! lol that dang game was covered three hours long , i about ran out of beer ."
8424,it will be ok . did yo u knw tat car of the 25 largest stadiums belong or college football teams ?
8425,"i love in the south , now . so yeah i know he big college football is ! so , i can understand why the stadiums are big , heck even some of the high school stadiums would impress you ."
8426,that is true . the first playoff game for the nfl was played on a 80 yard field in chicago stadium in 1932 .
8427,"probably , none of those old timers still alive that played in that game ."
8428,i think it would be possible debut probably for very many .
8429,"that 's back when they wore those little chin skull caps for helmets . hardly no rules at all , basically anything goes !"
8430,hey did you know ben roethlisberger has the most wins hey a qb in the browns ome stadium since they were reinstated ?
8431,"i did n't know that fact . 's , it 's been fun chatting with you this morning about all things football . i hope you enjoy hue rest of your day ."
8432,"hi , do you like football ?"
8433,i have a passing knowledge of football and the nfl
8434,that isp void q w ware getting close to the superb owl !
8435,how familiar are ou who the nfl ?
8436,"i like the denver broncos a lot . but there were many things i did not know , like that there is not a rule against female players !"
8437,i was surprised that he average nfl game only ad 11 minutes of gameplay
8438,"that suprised me too , did you know what embedded chips are use for in teh nfl ?"
8439,"i believe they embed chips into footballs to track velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location"
8440,"that is right t , i thin it great because that is how we get so much info on the performance . i had no realize the teams only rest one week surfing she season"
8441,"won when they play , there are chips in theirs houlderpads to track their movement and gather data for better plays nad understanding of foot , l"
8442,"that is good ! i learned that there was a game back in 1916 and the score was 222 to 0 by georgia tech , isn ; t tthat amazing"
8443,another amazing fact is that benjarvus green ellis never fumbled the football in his entire nfl career . both amazing incidents nad people
8444,"thay 9s tru i something that i found really funny is that u o coal other room for the visiting team is painted n pink , i think that is a message"
8445,i wonder if there is a funny or interesting reason for this ?
8446,the want to intimidate the visitors ! an interesting fact is that there is only one left handed qb in the nfl
8447,"speaking of qb , quarterbacks are my favorite position in fooball since they are the core of the teams offence ."
8448,they are so important they are the leaders and the are the one that call for the huddle
8449,did you know that signature circular huddle was invested by a deaf quarterback to prevent the other team from reading his hand signals ?
8450,i think that is so neat ! his name was paul hubbard
8451,"did you also know tha atom brady , who has won the us ; bowl on several occasion , steve as a backup qb and never got to play during highschool l ?"
8452,that is hard to believe ! ! i found it really funny . well it was nice talking to you . . have a good one
8453,hello . are you familiar with the nfl ?
8454,"i am a fan , the chicago bears . you ?"
8455,i used to be a fan of 49ers . i lived in the bay area for 25 years .
8456,not any more ? d id you move ?
8457,yes i did . i heard that nfl has no rule against female played .
8458,no rules against females ? that 's interesting ? where di you ever to ?
8459,as long as they meet the league 's eligibility requirements . it would n't be easy even for physically strong men .
8460,i can not believe the controversy clay matthews has brought on with all his coughing penalties .
8461,i did not answer your earlier question . i moved to a dallas suburb . i heard that clay was legalize for coughing age passer for a thirdquarte5r hit on redskin qb alex smith .
8462,yeah . he got two in the first few games and had to pay back the rest of the season . no worries about not answering the question . i did n't want to probe too much if you did n't want to answer . sad are you a dallas fan now ?
8463,no . i have not been here very long . mathew apparently violate teh digestive that a defender can not land on a quarterback .
8464,"as a bears fan , i was happy o see it ! did you now the nl uses chips in shoulder pads ?"
8465,yes i do . technology is used every where now .
8466,i know . i am a little worried about it . do you know who the only rocket scientist in the nfl is ?
8467,no . please tell me about ut . is that alex smith ? he finished college in two years .
8468,"good guess but it 's the lions coach , matt patricia ! alex smith as really smart though ."
8469,"oh , okay . thank you . do you know that trange rule related to the new orlean saints cheerleaders ?"
8470,i do not . what is it ?
8471,"cheerleaders can not eat at the same restaurant as the players . if they are at he restaurant and a player or players coke om , they have to leave ."
8472,that seems really sexist and incredibly inconvenient for the cheer leaders . what a terrible rule .
8473,"the rule needs to bey changed , forms 've . i 've got t run . nice chatting with you ."
8474,hello ! do you like to watch football ?
8475,i sometimes watch football . you ?
8476,"yes same here ! i ca n't believe that in the 1960 's , bowlers made more money than football players ."
8477,the footbal players it not have made much . it was a golden age for bowlers though . i guess i was born tool ate .
8478,are young food at bowling ? i 'm terrible so i would have mac less money playing football .
8479,i would have been terrible at both . i would have had a job painting locker rooms .
8480,would you paint visitor locker rooms pink like the iowa hawkeyes '
8481,"i guess i would try it . if it worked on the other a , then i would sell it services to every team ."
8482,i feel a business plan coming soon ! i wish i was the only who created the yellow in in football games . espn won an emmy for that .
8483,i bet the person who came up with idea got a raise and a promotion . that was a good idea .
8484,ia agree ! i like matching the had but i ca n't believe we really only watch 11 minutes of actual gameplay !
8485,i would just watch the ighligths from the news . that would probably be enough . it is n expensive sport to watch .
8486,it really is . i do like the technology taht the nfl has been using though !
8487,do you mean the coins that the players have ?
8488,yes hope ! they can basically track players every move and i think they do things with the footballs as well .
8489,that is great . i bet i helps coaches it strategy and the tv announcers with analysis .
8490,"when you watch instant replay , it all makes sense now . did you know there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl it now ?"
8491,that surprises me . where are all the others ? is that so unusual ? there are left handed pitchers .
8492,i wonder if there is a disadvantage ? i can make three lefthanded quarterbacks ever haha .
8493,there might be problems for the rest of the team to adapt to a lefty . i wonder .
8494,thats a good question ! well thanks for an awesome talk . have a good one !
8495,do you follow american football ? the cleveland browns will get a new coach at the end . this season .
8496,"wow ! there are only 32 nfl herad coaching positions , so they 're highly coveted . but then , it 's the browns !"
8497,lets just hope next season is a better season tha this past with coach hue jackson .
8498,"and lately baker mayfield has revealed the full extent of his parking potential . he was a first round pick , and is the rookie quarterback . with the right coach , maybe the browns can win me big gems ."
8499,"well , they move a good quarterback , so that is a god start to winning games ."
8500,"on a recent sunday , mayfield led the browns to a 350 victory over the cincinnati bengals . it 's nice to win against another ohio team !"
8501,witch mayfield as the quarterback i am not surprised the brown won . he is good nd the quarterback position is involved so much in offensive play .
8502,indeed . and he 's still just a rookie . did you know thati hen he was a time university of oklahoma he considered quitting to pursue fulltime competitive gaming ?
8503,"i wonder if he would have been good at it . there is money in the nfl l , but you lifetime earnings are less than that othe jobs , such as engineer ."
8504,"wow . probably less risk of injury as an engineer , too ? it 's still a lot of minutes or just an average of 11 minutes . live gameplay , which is the average for an nfl game !"
8505,"as a woman i suppose i could technically eb allowed to play in the nba , but i do n't think i have the talent . i do n't think i ave the patience to be a cheerleader because of their rules ."
8506,i know ! i heard that new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in th sesame restaurant as any nfl player ! that would not work for me !
8507,"and , you would have to find something to do the rest of the year , as the season is only 17 weeks ."
8508,"in the 1960 , top bowlers wide twice as much as top football stars . i wonder how the salaries compare now ? learning to bowl might be cheaper than engineering school !"
8509,"well players have received degrees , so i suppose they could have a career after football ."
8510,indeed . i love o watch football on tv . especially since espn created the superimposed yellow line representing teh first down line for american football games . they on an emmy for that ! dp you like to watch football ?
8511,"there are many types of footbal l , do you mean nfl american style , of what the rest of the world calls football bout americans call soccer ? ."
8512,"good point ! i love to watch gridiron football , or american or canadian football , and i love rugby football , too . it 's hard to believe football has been around so long . did you know there are references to it by indigenous people in many different parts of the world , even in prehistoric times ! ?"
8513,"there are so many types , but since i live where football is a regional word for the nfl style that is what i see . i am not surprised that it is a really old sport ."
8514,"there really are . during the 20th century , several of the various types of football became some of the most popular team sports in the world !"
8515,"in america it is been over a century of playing . teh highest scoring game ever was long ago in 1916 , with a score of 2220"
8516,"wow ! 222 points in one game ! almost as bad as some browns losses ! maybe the winners heard the other team play calls . . id you know the circular huddle teams use today was created diy was d . hubbard , a deaf qua5tebrakfc ? they used it so the other team could ot read his hand signals ."
8517,maybe the new coach for the browns will help the to the playoffs and the superbowl this year .
8518,"i hope so ! the first thing any coach ness is a good quarterback , ad like we talked about , bake mayfield is a good one ! and since quarterbacks are often responsible for calling hte play and touching the ball on nearly every offensive play , he should have a big impact . a good coach adn a good quarterback might finally get the browns to the super bowl ."
8519,clevelands can hope so ! thanks for talking football with me .
8520,do you watch the nfl ?
8521,yes all the time . did you know the women can play too ?
8522,yes there is no rule against that as long as they qualify
8523,yes i hope we get to see a coed game sometimes soon
8524,yea me too . did you know the game technically is of 11 minutes ?
8525,yes and we are glued to the tv for that feels like forever
8526,"haha i know . did you know engineers make , more over the , lifetime ethan nfl players ?"
8527,yes but they also have longer careers so maybe that has an effect on the income
8528,true . did you ear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
8529,yes it is sexist nd it has to go honestly . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker rom pink ?
8530,hm i wonder if it is supposed to aves ome effect on them
8531,i wonder too . in the 60s bowlers mad more money than football players
8532,wow i guess it was a much popular sport back in the way so that makes sense
8533,yes it is true . did you know spun won an emmy once ?
8534,"yes that wa for the superimposed yellow line , what a feat"
8535,you . do you know that the highest score in college football is ?
8536,yes that is 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
8537,yes . do you know who benjarvus el ; ks i ?
8538,yes the rb that never fumbled the ball . do you liek tom brady ?
8539,ye si do . in high school 24 as a reserve qb that was never started
8540,"thee lost a great chance with him there , too bad for the"
8541,hello ! do you follow the nfl ?
8542,sure ! what do think of the cowboys acquisition of omari cooper ?
8543,it gave them someone they desperately needed after losing dem bryant .
8544,"that is for sure . cooper had a good run in his first years in the league , but his performance with the raiders has been lackluster as of late . i hope he can step it up with the cowboys !"
8545,yes ! i 'm sure with the use of the tracking chips that they put in the players shoulder pads to record their every move he ill start to work on his route running .
8546,masked sense . it seems ike a lot of technology for a game that only has 11 minutes o factual bal play in the entire game .
8547,"that 's awful short for the amount of money they get paid if you ask me . speaking of earnings , the average lifetime earnings of an average engineer re higher than that of an average nfl or mlb player ."
8548,"yeah , buy they both eat well . that is not true for the cheerleaders ! besides watching their weight , ome clubs , like the saints , prohibit cheerleaders from dining in the same restaurant as the players . that can put a trump in your diet !"
8549,that seems like an odd rule . i wonder if we 'll see a female nfl player any time soon since there 's no written rule against allowing them to play ?
8550,"yeah , it may b they only way the ladies can get a good meal ! the univ of iowa already has their visitors locker room , painted pink , so we are getting close !"
8551,i wonder if that was for breasts warner awareness ? in the 1960 's top bowlers made 2 time sas much as the top football star of the day . times sure have changed since then .
8552,"i 'll say ! in the 1960s , there was no espn emmyawardwinning yellow line superimposed on the tv screen ! revolutionized the game for us armchair qbs !"
8553,yes it did ! i ca n't believe the score of the highest scoring game refer . georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 !
8554,"a lot has changed since 1918 when that performance made the record books , but it is nice to see a record like that styl , l standing today !"
8555,that 's just a crazy score . lol did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf qb so he could relay hand signs to the other players ?
8556,"nice ! and now the phrase , huddle up ' is known across the entire planet ! l ness snow us that the only lefthanded qb in hte nfl today is kellan moor . i miss john alway !"
8557,yes . that whole era when alway played seemed like it was better than now . the quarterback touches th ball on almost every offensive play and in the one responsible for always calling the plays in the huddle .
8558,"yah , where are the modernday refrigerator perry type runners today ? there are some good ones , l ike benjarvis ellisgreej , th patriots rnningback that never once fumbled the bal life his entire career , but it ish a to find a legend on the field these days !"
8559,that 's a pretty impressive stat to have ! current browns qb baker mayfield almost quit football so he could pursue a full time competitive gaming career . sounds like that would have been a bit risky .
8560,"yeah , but it speaks toward the mortality od he youth . i could not imagine as a child if i had a chance to go outside and play football that i would have passed on it to stay inside and pretend to play football . i know mayfield is more of a halo 3 our , but the i think you know what i am saying , right ?"
8561,yes i do know ! lol it ws nice chatting with you !
8562,"hi , do you like football ?"
8563,no it seems to go on forever
8564,but if one has 11 minutes of playing time . . .
8565,rest and the season only goes on for 11 weeks but then they drag it on with al those ther competitions
8566,"the good news is that they now hav a new league , the aaf . that starts after the nfl . you have to eb even more excited now"
8567,"woo you , do you like football ?"
8568,i can feel the sarcasm . . . . i do . i also understnad why people do n't watch it . there is so much more to do on a sunday than watch footbal .
8569,back in the 1960s bowlers earned more than footballers how times shange
8570,engineers now make more than the avg football players . seems like a poor decision to risk permanent brain damage .
8571,one player even considered competitive video games instead i wondr if theyd would mark emerge ?
8572,"it would n't hurt at ad . plus mayfield was a great halo player , supposedly . . ."
8573,why is there only one left handed quarter back ?
8574,left handers throw a ball that rotates opposite of right handers and fade in the opposite direction . it is difficult to have and get comfortable with them .
8575,i never knew that
8576,i am full of useless sports knowledge .
8577,did you know already that iowas painted the locker room pink ?
8578,that 's a weird choice of color l i wonder if it actually works ?
8579,what is it intended to do ?
8580,make there visiting team play softer . i do not think that would work on me .
8581,maybe they shoudl of tried with georgia tech in 2016
8582,h a ! it was nice chatting with you !
8583,how parr you today ?
8584,"hey i 'm good , how are you ? are you a nfl fan ?"
8585,i am and am coding lol thank you .
8586,are you an nfl fan ? familiar with chick foles all all and what an unlikely story i was ?
8587,"do n't know a lot but him , what the unlikely story about ."
8588,"well , the eagles were doing awesome with qb carson wentz and were favorites , but then he tore a knee lament in week 14 and a out for the rest of the season"
8589,yeah team is a unlikely story . did you hear the iowa state visiting locker room is pink
8590,"no i did n't . that 's pretty weird but proabably messes with other teams heads . are you familiar with football , specifically then lof ?"
8591,"to the best of my knowledge , , ' ; t get to watch the as as much anymore and was disappointed with the performances in the super bowl not necessarily the outcome ."
8592,"ah okay , so did you see when nick foles won the super owl last year ?"
8593,honestly his not watch last years . was it a good game ? i hear the live action in the game is only about 11 minutes .
8594,big was pretty awesome to see a backup winning it . does was confident though . i did know that . a lo of commercial and play chaplin g .
8595,ya i hear there going to start putting tracking chips on the players pads .
8596,"yeah , so inside the footballs . cool technology . i wonder if the quarterbacks care since they touch the all so much ."
8597,"probably not , they got enough to worry about ! did you know that there was a time when bowlers made twice as much as top nfl players ?"
8598,"i 've heard that before , that ' z crazy . but at the same , did you know the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher tha nanny fl played r ?"
8599,yeah you ca n't play pro football for 5 years . do you know what the highest score college game was ?
8600,i know those games can out of control sometimes and be very high scoring o lopsided . tell me .
8601,it was georgia tech and cumberland the score was 2200 . cumberland lost . i would have hated to be on that bus ride home .
8602,"2200 , wow . i wonder if the cumberland quarterback did anything at all or did they just constantly turn over the ball ."
8603,"i nwas back i 1916 , things were a lot different then . hey i heard espn won an award ."
8604,yes . i know why . they added that famous yellow line that w snow see on every game on tv for teh 1st down marker .
8605,"that 's right , i like that line it makes things muh easiet . nice chatting with you ."
8606,"hi . are you ready to talk bout quarterbacks , national football league , and football ?"
8607,"yes , i love football , and enjoy going to the games ! !"
8608,i really love going to those live gamer where yo can get te feel of the game . quarterback are my favorite . did you know that alex smith to so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a junior and graduated with his bachelor ? s degree in two years ?
8609,he must be smart as well as talented ! ! maybe he has a photographic mind . . . . i do too like quarterbacks . do you liek avocado ice cream ike tom brady ?
8610,"yes , i 've actually made it in my vitamin and it was good . do can not taste the avocado in it . tom brady is smart like that . he 's my favorite qb . i did n't know but recently found out that the qb is considered the leader of the offensive team and calls the plays in the huddle ."
8611,"yes , that 's true and a deaf player started that huddle so the other team could not see the paris ! ! interesting . . ."
8612,"yes , that who paul hubbard , right ? he was the deaf player that created the circular huddle . cool ."
8613,"yes , i love om brady too ! i got to see jim this year at walt disney world after the game in the parade ! !"
8614,"wow , how lucky we you ? did you also know about former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis and that the never fumbled the football in his nfl career ? that 's a unique attributed e ."
8615,that is impressive or sure ! ! did you know tom brady 's wife makes twice as much as he does ! lol
8616,"wow , hat ' sa lot of money between she two i them . apparently , the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is bigger than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl or mlb player . engineers music make a lot of money ."
8617,yes they do ! ! did yu know tom brady has never ate a strawberry ! not sure hey ? thinking eh might have allergies ?
8618,"yes , that would be a good reason not eat any . did you know that new orleans saint 'd cheerleaders are forbidden from eating i nthe same restaurant as any nfl player r ?"
8619,"is , that 's a little outdated do n't you think ? maybe they think there would be too much togetherness in the restaurant . the should let leah other know beforehand where their going if its such an issue ! lol"
8620,"i did n't think about it that way , b ut you could be right , maybe it 's an old rule still on the books . did you that the nfl has no written rule against female players ."
8621,"yes , i wonder how they would play against such big guys ? maybe eh kicker position would be safe . at , east they have the option , never know ?"
8622,"the problem is how could aw man meet the eligibility requirements , really ?"
8623,"lol , i agree ! did you know as far as losing games , the new england patriots and the buffalo bill agree equal ?"
8624,"yes , i did just hear that . the new england patriots are doing way better sine they just won the last super bowl though ."
8625,"that 's true , after 15 seasons as starter tom brady has lead te patriots to 8 superbowls , more than any player in history ! !"
8626,"yes , what a great quarterback he i . nice chatting with you , have a good one ."
8627,"hello , are you a fan of football ?"
8628,love the football ! what ' a your favorite team ?
8629,i am not a hue fan ! i think teams like the rams and broncos are interesting though .
8630,benjarvus greenellis never fumbles the football in his nfl career . i wonder if he ever played against iowa state . their pink visiting team room might have affected him .
8631,"that 's interesting , it must be difficult to never fumble the ball . did you know women are technically allowed to play in the nfl ?"
8632,i think that 's great ! i wonder what position the first woman in the nl will play . it 's just a matter of time .
8633,"there is already some misogyny present in the league , such as cheerleaders in new orleans having to leave a restaurant if a saints player comes in after ."
8634,tube hypermasculine nature of the sport makes that kind of bigotry inevitable . i think that the need to rethink the role of way in the super . i see more women on the screen as sportscasters .
8635,"absolutely . n nfl career itself may not even be as worth it as i thought . for example , the average lifetime earnings iq much higher for ah engineer than a football player ."
8636,we need engineers more than grown mon playng with a ball . i wish we could inspire kid stop study engineering .
8637,that is certainly fairy . there is an interesting element of engineering in football ironically . shoulder pads and footballs hasve tracking chips inside of them for example
8638,i guess it helps understand things like injuries . it could also be used for strategy .
8639,"absolutely . however football could be more progressive , such as iowa 's visiting locker room being pink ."
8640,"i think that 's meant to psych out the opposition . i wonder if it really worse ,"
8641,"i doubt it really does , i woul hope players are n't they fragile . i ca n't believe teh highest score ever was 2220 though , thats ems ridiculously high !"
8642,"did n't expect a tech school to play football well , but cumberland might have been tiny . i wonder what she spread was ."
8643,ahh i wonder if betting was even a things back then . i suppose that iznm't as bad as the jv football team that could n't even score a touchdown the entire year .
8644,maybe those jv players woul ; d have been better off as engineers . or bowlers in the 1960s .
8645,"definitely , it 's interesting how players think about other carrers . such a saber mayfield considering choosing competitive gaming over footbal l ."
8646,"fewer injuries , perhaps some interesting sponsorship opportunities ."
8647,"absolutely , but i 'm sure most do n't regret choosing football . it was nice chatting with you !"
8648,nice cheat !
8649,"i ca n't wait for the superbowl this year . but , out of the 32 teams , my team is n't in it . it you watch the nfl ?"
8650,i like to watch and am also excited about the super bowl . i do n't really get a chance to watch though .
8651,you may be your sunglasses if you watch the university of iowa and visit their pink locker room . that sounds really bright !
8652,yeah i was thinking not that . i assume it was to discourage the other team .
8653,lucky he football layers did n't get discouraged in the nfl in the 1960 's when bowlers made twice as much as the football stars
8654,yeah that was surprising to hear . it was unbelievable that they a ; flower da football game to continue with a score like 2200 . mercy ! !
8655,sounds like some was taken advantage o f ! hey losing team sound like they needed the homer patriot benjarvus greenellis who never fumbled in his nfl career .
8656,"thati or the fact the is no official rule that keeps women from playing football , they ay have had a chance ."
8657,six teams make the playoffs from each conference . i wonder who will win teh superbowl after these singleelimination games ?
8658,it will be interestin it watch . i can appreciate a young person who is also interested in their minds as well as sports . like allen smith who began working on his masters before becoming a first round draft pick in 2005 .
8659,paul d hubbard was amazing too in that he was a to quarterback being deaf . how do he know of people were going to say him ? he even invented the huddle so other teams could ' tread his hand signals .
8660,yeah that goes to show you just cause circumstances see mintolerable there is always a way to overcome .
8661,"too bad tom brady 's high school , l jv team at junipero serra high school did n't think of something ingenious like starting brad ! they may have won a game or two ."
8662,lol ! the average game only has 11 minutes of live game play
8663,i wonder how long baker mayfield would have to work if he chose fulltime competitive gaming instead of pro football . i guess more than 11 minutes .
8664,tiger eis only one left handed carter back in the nfl ; kellan moore .
8665,i wonder if they means he has a lot more natural talent because with all the technology they use is it geared to assist lefthanded ? considering that the quarterback touches the ball on almost all of the offensive plays that is quite a feat to be different !
8666,yeah whe i played in high school the qb was left handed . it was awkward because the ball spun the wrong way
8667,"interestings o think about . i guess they do n't have a quarterback in soccer , but only in american and canadian footbal l ."
8668,technology has brought a lot of things a long way . i mean embedded tracking chips in shoulder pads to track players every move is kind of creepy .
8669,sounds like something from a 007 movie . maybe because of the engineering involved that is why engineers make more average lifetime earnings than stat of an nfl player and mlb player !
8670,"greetings ! i do n't know about you , but i 'm not much of a football fan . that 's if by ' football ' we mean american football . if it means soccer , then i 'm a fan ."
8671,well i like football as an american haha . i do n't personally like soccer but thats just me haha . do you have a favorite quarterback ?
8672,not really . but i did recently learn that the quarterback is considered the leader of the offensive team . i had thought the qb was it charge of the entire team .
8673,oh i did n't know that either . there 's a quarterback in the nfl who 's left handed . he 's hte only one . his name 's kellen moore
8674,just one ? ! taht 's interesting . one of the trivia things i kno bout quarterbacks is that baker mayfield once thought bout quitting football t become a professional gamer . i guess he 's really good at halo 3 .
8675,"that 's cool . i used to be really good at halo 3 as well haha . i ca n't believe those american flags at fooball grades can cost up to 50 , 00 . i can think of a lot more cool things to make for that much money haha"
8676,geez . there 's so much money that goes into this sport k especially salaries . but get a degree i engineering and you 'll make more money over your lifetime than if you 're an average nfl player .
8677,not a bad idea ! do you like snoop dogg ? i guess he wrote a fight son for his son 's high school football team . that 's pretty awesome
8678,ha ! somehow i ca n't see him as a father figure ep but high school and earlier is where many of the great players got heir start or tried . the jv team than tom brady played fo in high school never uae him he season .
8679,is n't that shocking . i wonder if a high school coach is kicking himself . but maybe ton brady was n't so good back they . did you hear about the one high school football stadium in allen texas ?
8680,no . what about it ?
8681,"it cost 60 to make and can house 18 , 000 people . i just think that that money could be better spent somehow but what do i know"
8682,"60 ? ! are you sure about the amount ? but some facilities are interesting . fore example , at the univerity of iowa the visiting team 's locker room is painted completely pink ."
8683,oops it was 60 million dollars lol . stadiums are super expensive . 14 of the largest 25 stadiums belong to american football teams
8684,"i if n't know that . i wonder if any of those teams will on bday have female players . i heard that nfl has no written rule against it , but women would just have to meet eligibility requirements ."
8685,you 're right they do n't have a rule against it . the also do n't have a rule against tracking their players apparently hey use chips embedded int he uniforms 5o track the players locations on the field
8686,"hmm . cant ' they just see them ? ! ; , it ' ? s amazing some of ther technology that 's used in games . espn , for example , l won an emmy for creating that superimposed firstdown line we see on tv ."
8687,taht is a genius invention though ! another genius is matt patricia . i guess he 's a rocket scientist to also coaches in the nfl
8688,"i do n't know about him . bu ti know some of the players really are smart , contrary to the stereotype . liek alex smith , he finished his bachelor 's degree in two years and was working on his master 's degree when e was drafted by the nfl ."
8689,he seems really smart ! did you know that he first nfl playoff game was in chicago stadium mack in 1932 ?
8690,"no , that 's a new one on me . i wonder how many teams they had back then . it 's 2 teams now , if i 'm not mistaken ."
8691,i do think it 's 32 right now . and yes chicago stadium is home to the chicago blackhawks actually they share a field
8692,"do you like efoobtal , ?"
8693,yea the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women would in fact be allowed if they met ther league 's eligibility requirements . i wonder why none have ever tried ?
8694,probably the thought of being a quarterback getting slacked
8695,its hard to say . did u know in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars
8696,no i did not know the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player of an average mlb player
8697,wow that amazing . ana average nfl game only has 11 minutes f live gameplay . thats even more amazing to me
8698,exactly and during that time he nfl use stacking his to record players every move
8699,i read that the chips are in their shoulder pads . it 's too technical for me .
8700,also located inside the footballs i he no idea
8701,seems a lot of time tracking stuff you know ?
8702,"yes they track velocity , ball spew d , and location that 's so interesting people really love football all around the world"
8703,heres a good one . the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 whe georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220
8704,wow that 's a big difference . must have been a really good team geogia tech had . like former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled a ball in his career
8705,the university if iowa 's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink
8706,so cute ! did you know saints cheerleaders are required to leave a restaurant if a player comes in after
8707,koi thats ridiculous i think
8708,isnt ' it . . . they are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant ever
8709,the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football teams is completely ; painted pink
8710,yes very welcoming whenever there is a female player in the future
8711,lol i hear that lol
8712,goood night !
8713,"hello , d o you wathc football ?"
8714,i sometimes watch football . you ?
8715,"some , although i do watch the superbowl every year ."
8716,i try to watch the bowl . i didnt get to watch it this year . i heard it was slow . last year was better .
8717,"yeah it was , the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
8718,that is a shame . the ticket are so expensive yet there is so little action . and no women in the game either .
8719,"wearing of women , there are actually no rules discriminating against them to play in the nfl ."
8720,"i figure eventually old of the teams will put a woman on the team , just for the publicity ."
8721,"hopefully , bum they mighty get injured . flootabll is known for its concussions !"
8722,"yes , boy , those are a problem at every level . , maybe there should be high school ; girls teams firs ."
8723,did you know tat engineers make more in a lifetime than nfl players ?
8724,"yeah , that makes sense . longer career , rising salary , fewer concussions"
8725,and professional bowlers made twice as much as nfl players back in the 1960s !
8726,i wounder how much that actually was . probably pretty good for bowling . it wa sa golden age . the bowler had the perfect athletes they . lol
8727,it make sense az fooball only startled to grow roughly 25 years ago .
8728,"yes , i had grown tremendously . the first sb was like 53 years ago . not nearly as old as baseball"
8729,"there is also only one left handed quarterback in the nfl , kellan moore ."
8730,he is the only one ? i am surprised because there are so many left handed pitchers in the mlb .
8731,"yeah , because it is an advantage in the mlb . i guess it is not in the nfl ."
8732,"that could be the case . coaches might note ant to have to deal with the wrinkle caused by a lefty . anyway , great chat !"
8733,"yes , have a good night !"
8734,"thunk , d ! good night !"
8735,you too !
8736,"i know little about football , but i know enough i say that tom nd bil ; often deliver ."
8737,bill does seem to be quite te coach . i do n't think he has been attached to a losing team has he ?
8738,what i also know frogs port is that one game does n't malek a season . do n't get worked up over one loss .
8739,very true . it seems like in football thigns can cage in an instant .
8740,"i guess tom brady is considered one of the all time great , and he still keeps winning ."
8741,he is quite the player . people really them to dislike him though .
8742,"again i dont ' really know enough but i suspect it might be jealousy . my understanding list hat must have fixed things this yea ri nthe end , did n't they in the super bow l ?"
8743,"yeah they did . it was n't even really a game to be honest . hey were ahead by so much that it was n't fun to watch from what i 've heard d ,"
8744,i find it amusing that tomb brady struggled to get on his high school team .
8745,that is hilarious . i bet that school is kicking themselves no w .
8746,"maybe he was just a late bloomer , that might also be the reason he going on so long , is n't he near his fortress ?"
8747,i think do . that could make ernest . it has come a long way from that dirt field in the 30 's
8748,"i wonder if the patriots can win again not year . there will probably e the same stories before hand , or if they lose a game or two , that tom and bill are done ."
8749,i think htey are probably going to struggle . if they had lost one or the other it would n't be ad bulb othe being gone is going to be rough .
8750,"i wonder how the boston area will honor them once they are done , some statues or a stadium name possibly ? there are probably lots of quarterback statues around tag country ."
8751,i could see that . maybe they will rename some local stadium fo them or something . the certainly have a complicated history .
8752,some controversy i believe . spygate and deflategate .
8753,i know about deflategate but i wonder what spygate was . probably them stealing plays od something .
8754,"probably , goes on in most professions sports . someone seen spying on fo the team training , or something similar ."
8755,ah that would make sense . did n't really seem to work though with how behind they were before pulling out some wins .
8756,good talking to you . good bye
8757,hi where do you follow the nfl ?
8758,not too much . i think it 's disgusting that the highest paid employees in hte department of defense are football coaches .
8759,wow . they make more than the generals ? o
8760,"they do . maybe snoop dogg can write them a fight song , like he did for his sons ' high school team ."
8761,that 's awesome ! what 's not awesome is that the new orleans emits cheerleaders are n't allowed to eat at the same restaurant as any nfl player .
8762,"that 's insane , and so sexist . why does a highschool need a 50 million football stadium ?"
8763,ahh . . . iv ' e heard bout that stadium . have you ever been to texas ? high school football is probably more popular than the nfl .
8764,"i have , and did n't care for it . i et they have a few of those huge flags , that are over 50k ."
8765,yes i bet they do . the university of iowa 's visitor locker room is painted pink . wonder why ?
8766,"intimidation , is my guess . it 's probably very relaxing . 9s there really only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?"
8767,yes but i ca n't remember his name . do you know it ?
8768,i think it is kellan moore
8769,that 's his name . in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stores of the day .
8770,that is crazy . i guess there is a recent scientist who is a football coach . his plays has drive the players crazy .
8771,that 's interesting . bet he has some unique plays . did you know that espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line on tv ?
8772,that is insane . wy do they put tracking clips in the shoulder pads of the players ?
8773,i am not aware of tracking chips ? former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the ball in his nfl career . nice job !
8774,they are also in the balls . i wonder why ?
8775,i have no idea . they must be there for a reason . lol the highest score ever for a football game was 220 ! thanks for the chat !
8776,i thin thaat was the georgia tech game l ahve a wonderful day .
8777,thanks you too .
8778,football fan ?
8779,"i like to watch it , but i am not a fan . did yu know hat espn wo an emmy for the creation of the superimposed ?"
8780,"yeah , that 's pretty cool . i ended how that would have affected the highest scoring football game of all time . 2220 ."
8781,"i hear about i . think that was in 1976 , but i am not sure wht happened ."
8782,1916 i think . georgia tech won .
8783,now i remember . in 1960 to as when top bowlers made twice as top football stars
8784,ah the malcom days when bow ; king was lucrative !
8785,i know . do go know something about the footbal ; l codes ?
8786,i know they 're thinking of changing how they apply the ' coughing he passer ' penalty .
8787,ok . the are certain insteresting thing bout football like the fact that a university locker room is painted pink . do n't know why .
8788,i think to intimidate them . pink being ' girly ' . that 's dumb . who cares ? the nfl could have female players . there 's no rule against it .
8789,could be .
8790,the nfl has tracking chips in the shoulder pads do players to track their movements on the field . kind of interesting .
8791,hot 's pretty interesting . i guess they want to try velocity and rotation nad some other things .
8792,"yeah , interesting that they would get that deep into the weeds on it . i wonder if they do taht i nthe other football games around the world , soccer , aussie rules etc . ?"
8793,hew can they forbidden from eating in the same restaurant ?
8794,cheerleaders ?
8795,ne orleans saints cheerleader
8796,i do n't know . that seems dumb . trying to disease fraternization or just really sexiest ?
8797,i dont ' know why but it is too much . they are required to leave thy restaurant if an nfl player comes in after
8798,"well , nice chatting . cya !"
8799,"hello , did you know that the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football teams is painted all pink ?"
8800,no why would they paint it pink ?
8801,i guess so the opposing team could eels imasucated ? i do n't know ! !
8802,"i do n't know much about football . it must be popular , there is a lot or people interested in betting on games ."
8803,"i there ? is think it 's illegal to bet n nfl game , but in ot sure about college ."
8804,"after q new judgement , sports gambling is now allowed in any state . if you have too much money ."
8805,"i didn ' realize that . . . i do n't have too much money so i guess i wln'tb e gambling , lol . i did n't realize women could play in the nfl if they wanted to !"
8806,"there shouldnt ot be a rule preventing them to play , but i would not follow it more if the played ."
8807,"well , there is no rule but women do have to meet the league 's eligibility requirements . maybe that 's why we do n't see any women ? but considering 'the an engineer earns more than the average nfl player , i would recommend higher education !"
8808,"oh i did know that , it seems that football is generating so much money that the players would be paid more than engineers bt he highest paid employees in the department of defense are football coaches ."
8809,"wait a second , department of defense e ? as in the military ? s o the dod football coaches make more than say a sergeant major ? that 's crazy ! ! that i guess the average coal makes millions a year . . . i dunno"
8810,"football is quite popular , games generate a lot of money , in texas there is a high school football stadium that can hold 18 000 people ."
8811,wow ! ! football is big in texas . . . and everything is big in texas . . . but wow ! ! did you know th circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback ? he did n't want the other team reading his and signals !
8812,"that is interesting , quarterbacks can be inventive , brad johnson is the only who threw a touchdown pass to himself ."
8813,"how did he pull that off ? tomb way was the backup quarterback in his hs , his team had such a ba season that they did n't win a single game or even score a touchdown ! yet they never put tom brady in ! !"
8814,"i do n't know , maybe it has the do with who is the child of whom ."
8815,"good point , that was probably it . but stil . . . that coach must have rally disliked tom brady or his family to do that !"
8816,"there is a lot o money nad prestige in football , 14 of th 325 largest stadiums in the world are college football stadiums , so politics are never far ."
8817,"that 's very true . going back to women and football , the new orleans saint 's cheerleaders annoy eat int he same restaurant as any nfl player . so if they are eating and a player walks in the cheerleader has to leave !"
8818,"that s not fair , it puts down the cheerleader like a second class citizen ."
8819,"it does , hopefully the rule will change . i 'm sure he ; use do n't follow it though . . . i hope . great chat !"
8820,do you watch much football ?
8821,"no , i dont watch football regularly , there is not enough action to keep my attention , there is only 11 minutes of gameplay in a match . and you , do you lie football ?"
8822,it ill watch it in it is on but i o n't go out of my way to watch it . i think they focus the much on the qb on on and off the field .
8823,"yeah , i have heard all the drama abou 'the contract of blake bortles and id on ' steven like the jaguars ."
8824,what happened with blake bortles ?
8825,"phd jaguars could have hired kirk cousins , since he is a free agent , but they choose to stay with bortles and give him a 54 million contract ."
8826,wow tha seems like a obscene amount of money . is that just for one season ! ?
8827,no until 2022 but it replaces th contract that he already has . it will be around 19 million per year .
8828,i ca n't see how anyone is that good of a qb t warrant that kind of month . imagine if they took taht money and spread it around instead of concentrating on one player ? the game could be a lot more interesting .
8829,"that is also what th jaguars are diid they area lull of young talents , they hope that bortles ill stay good as the the young ones will get better ."
8830,i guess that is a decent strategy . i 'm for it if it means the patriots get knocked down a peg or two . i do n't even watch football that much and find them annoying .
8831,and to think that tom brady was benched for a season in high school . and it was al sign season for the too .
8832,he is a quality player but i think they have become the yankees of football . we have reached a point where sponsorships and money have overridden what the game was intended to be .
8833,and waht would improve the game ?
8834,i think if we were to focus more on what happens during the plays . use some of that info and footage from the chips in th uniforms adn ball ? imagine being able to see the ball go down the filed rom that perspective . also put caps on sponsorships . of course treat the cheerleaders better is always top of the list .
8835,"i trink cheerleaders are a relic of the past , and some teams are treating them like a relic of the last , they should be removed from the game nd have their own competitive league ."
8836,those competative teams are amazing to watch . i would choose to watch that over a football game any day . paid they are n't just there to be eye candy for some slobbering men .
8837,"cheerleading is one that sports where theme is the most injuries , therefore it is a legitimate sport . it is funny that it is considered a sideshow in football , another sport will to of injuries ."
8838,there are wo many injuries in football . i ' glad they art doin studies now on what the head injuries are doing to the players . it is so dangerous .
8839,"yeah , and they have chips in the players ' equipment to monitor concussions . i hope it will help with the situation ."
8840,hopefully there ar new lot of instances of posts concussion rage that could be avoided if we can better protects he payers .
8841,hi how are you ;
8842,just fine . are you a fan of football ?
8843,"i am , w hay about you ?"
8844,"year , there 's a lot of interesting facts about the game . did you know there 's only one left handed quarterback in he nfl ?"
8845,"ye s , kellan moore if i am not mistaking ?"
8846,"yesh , that 's right . i bet it must be hard to defend against his passes , even with those tracking chips be have to wear ."
8847,"they also put trackers im the footbal , los !"
8848,"yeah , that 's amazing what they can do . but hey they got ta have some way to enforce some of those wacky rules of theirs ."
8849,agreed and its funny how the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live play .
8850,yeah several hours on television and 11 minutes of play . pretty funny .
8851,that is ridiculous . i was unaware that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is more than an average nfl or mlb player .
8852,well the keywordt here is lifetime nfl and mlb players can make absurd ammounts per year but they usually do n't play for decades .
8853,exactly ! if nfl careers were more than a couple years that statistic would not be sure i am sure .
8854,yeah . there 's also weird stings about football like how saints cheerleaders ca n't eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player . that 's bizarre .
8855,it is also weird and funny that iowas opposing teams . locker room is painted all pink .
8856,each i guess that 's to try to demoralize the opposing team . not that many people like pink .
8857,i am more it probably works . other teams probably hate it .
8858,they do plenty of stuff just to throw off the other team . like how the huddle was invented to hide a deaf quarterback 's sign language from the other team .
8859,that is interesting . did you know th highest score of a football game was 222 to 0 ?
8860,yikes . . . . i would not wan na be on the zero team . a sad sad day for georgia tech .
8861,seriously ! it was nice chatting with you !
8862,"yeah , thanks for th fun ."
8863,hey di doyou know te nfl uses chips to track the speed of footballs and the players ?
8864,i wonder if they use the data to make better plays and better understand football
8865,"ya that 's a goo question , i 'm just glad they do n't put those o civilians that would be really scary for the government to track you like thagt"
8866,i 'm surprised that teh nfl has only 11 min of actual gameplay
8867,"ha im surprised but not surprised , i do n't like sports so i 'm usually bored during games , and ya that kind of explains it haha"
8868,"thiel hue nfl had no written rules agains female players , it is a shame that some teams have biased rules such as the new orleans saints forbidding theur cheerleader strom eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player even if htey came first"
8869,"a that seems relaly weird , also weird is that bowlers used to make more than nfl players back int he 60 's"
8870,do you like any positions in particular ?
8871,"pants ay that i do , i do like quarterbacks though , i was happy tom brady on , what about you"
8872,i agree since the qb is the center of any offensive
8873,"i do like the patriots a lot , also that one player who has never fumbled the ball , i 'd give him the ball every time !"
8874,i like kellen moore since his is te only left handed qb in the nfl
8875,"oh defintely ! is n't i crazy that the average engineer makes more the the average nfl player over their lifetime , seems silly !"
8876,will they probably have to worry longer overall um any nfl players retire early due to injury
8877,"ya i think thas what happens , hopefully theyre careful with their money , isnt it wild that espn got an emmy form taking the allow line on tv for football"
8878,i thinkk half i because in those 11 minutes of real gameplay so much more oj so any help to help digest the situation for the public regarding a popular sport is a plus and significant contribution
8879,"haha ya it must be , it 's crazy the heist scoring football game was 2220 , i 'd definitely have given up before then !"
8880,either the winning team had talent like green ellis or tom brady or the losing team were just that bad . perhaps it was both
8881,"haha icy old see that , apparently it did happen in 119 so it was a long time ago"
8882,i wonder if any other game came anywhere close
8883,ya i have n't seen such a high scoring game anytime recently thats for sure
8884,hello
8885,hey . are you into nfl fooball ? i like the manning trotters . i 'm sad to see eli is n't quite working out for the giant .
8886,"yes i love football . i am an eagles fan . i think eli manning is a great footbal player ,"
8887,sure . he work shard and has many touchdown passes without interceptions l sad that sometimes that is n't enough .
8888,yes i agree . plus the football player work too hard . six days a week for a minutes of football .
8889,yep . eli had a bad season in 2017 and was even benched for a game by coach ben mcadoo . must have been humiliating .
8890,that is humiliating . did you know that baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a fulltime job in competitive gaming ?
8891,"i ca n't see that paying . . . the saints desire have a good kicker in wil late . in one game he made 4 consecutive field goals of 42 , 34 , 37 , an 26 yards ."
8892,yes i agree . eli manning is a 73 year old quarter back so i believe ther isn ' much o a future .
8893,unless he 's like brady . maybe he shoud start throwing to himself lime brad johnson did for a touchdown in a superbowl l .
8894,i did n't see that in the superbowl . did you know former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
8895,yep . pretty tight . i actually like college more than pro . i was surprised to learn that 14 of the world 's 25 largest stadiums are college .
8896,he nfl has no written rule against female players . i wonder if college football does ?
8897,"i think that 's a schoolbyschool thing not the ncaa . college is n't as hitech . then fl puts cracking chips on players to track their moves , velocity , rotation and location ."
8898,"yes , i agree . did yu know the average nfl game only has 11 minute of live gameplay ?"
8899,i can believe it . i played in hs and there was a lot of standing around .
8900,"yes it is alot of standing around , but then goes to the opposite extreme of getting tackled ."
8901,yep . i was surprised to know that kellan moore is the only lefthanded qb . the nfl . i would think there would be more .
8902,wow . i did n't know that . did you know the university of iowas locker roll for visiting football teams is completely painted pink ?
8903,that 's funny . a funny a the nfl actually having a rocket scientist coach in matt patricia . it does n't seem lke a good fit for a coach .
8904,i agree . you think she would work for nasa .
8905,agreed . i wonders hat heir wi gloss record is .
8906,hello do you like football ?
8907,"id o , but not as much as snoop dogg ! he wrote a fight song for his son 's football team ."
8908,thats pretty cool ! did you know theres no written law thati omen cant p ; ay in the nfl ?
8909,that 's interesting . i did not know that . football does hav new lot of rules for different types of fooball and hve different football codes .
8910,"right . also , the nfl uses tracking chips tot rack the players and the football ! isn tthat interesting ? !"
8911,so much data ! matt patricia must be good at interpreting data . he is the only coach in the nfl who is also w rocket scientist .
8912,"thats really cool , i guess football and physics have a lp tiny common . fooball is such a long game to watch , its like 3 hours long but only really 11 min in game play ;"
8913,"that is a long time . baseball is also a long sport . nfl quarterback russell wilson is stil blunder contract for baseball , despite not playing since 2011 ."
8914,thats interesting . i heard the university of iowa painted the opposing team locker room pink for
8915,that 's funny . college footbal list big time . 14 of the world 's 25 largest stadiums belong to college football teams .
8916,"yeah it seem like a lot of people put money into college football , thats crazy !"
8917,"speaking of money k , did you know there is a high school football stadium in allen , texas that cost 60 million to build !"
8918,"omg , that insane lol another fact that i crazy is there is a running back who had never fumbled a ball in his career !"
8919,that 's hard to do ! d o you now what else is hard to do in football ? throw a touchdown pass to yourself . brad johnson is the only quarterback in nfl history to throw a touhcdow pass to himself !
8920,"wow , he must be a fast runner ! i wonder if theres a video of it lol"
8921,"i 'd go to see that clip . speaking f football clips , jordan reed went viral for a clip of him doing yoga on the sideline ."
8922,i ponder why that is a big thing ? people have different ways of preparing or a game .
8923,that 's for sure . whatever it takes to get ready . football season is grueling . the 17 week regular season runs from early september to late december with only one bye week .
8924,i recently read that the circular huddle used today was created by w deaf quarterback !
8925,"that 's so cool ! the quarterback kids ther most important player , responsible for calling the play in the huddle ."
8926,"yeah , well its been good chatting , have a good one ."
8927,demo too like sports ?
8928,no not really
8929,personally i like football

8936,i do not and i do not care to . do you ?
8937,personally i like the quarterbacks since tey are the core of any offensive
8938,i knows hat the nfl was formed in 1920 .
8939,did you know who average game only has a dozen or so minutes of actual gameplay ?
8940,eleven average min .
8941,"in ny case , that is much shorter than it feel considering it takes hours"
8942,"exactly , so why does it take so long ?"
8943,"a lot of free , getting organized , planning , etc i guess"
8944,all what . thats why i dont really care . its pointless to me .
8945,"i can see your point , but i think of all the effort and prez that goes into making gore remaking the game in those few minutes exciting . anyway thanks for chatting ."
8946,i guess . not form e . have a good day .
8947,the same to you .
8948,do watch washington football ?
8949,no
8950,apparently they rank fourth in the nfl in total rushing yards .
8951,not too shabby
8952,"it seems good , i do n't pay a lot of attention to the states tough . do you ?"
8953,not very much either
8954,the nfl has no written rule against female players .
8955,so roman technically can play in the nfl if they were good enough
8956,yeah . it appears so . but engineers on average make more than players .
8957,engineer probably have longer career lengths
8958,"yeah , that is what i ' assuming ."
8959,carolina is doing well lmao with 33 such plays .
8960,"intresting , apparently they put chips in th players shoulder pads ."
8961,the chips go well with ranch .
8962,intersting concept . i think the are trying to track played .
8963,this i every fascinating
8964,"yeah , i 'm sur htey are running the numbers on something ."
8965,also funny that the cheerleaders cant din eat the same place the players do .
8966,"yeah , that is a full that a lot of teams have i think , not just the saints ."
8967,very interesting information
8968,apparently iowa 's soccer room is painted pink for visiting teams . hilarious .
8969,and top bowlers in the 60s bowlers made more money
8970,"yeah , i know . i 'm not a bad bowler either ."
8971,are you a bills fan ? my son ks a huge one !
8972,ca n't say that i am actually haha . 9 do n't really watch sports . how often do yu watch te nfl ?
8973,"quite a bit . i ave 2 boys ! thee wills always have a nissan at quarterback , that i say their season us n't the greatest . i am surprised taht they benched veteran and started allen . . . but they do n't always do what i think they should ."
8974,haha yeah i can see that . did you know the nfl uses tracking chips . teh put it in the shoulder pads . that would scare me if they could players off the field haha
8975,yes ! and in the footballs ! that is crazy . they are trying to register everything that happens . i guess that is hat happens the you are paying somebody big money !
8976,haha yep i agree . did you know that there is a coach in the nfl thats ' actually a rocket scientist ? his name is matt patricia
8977,no way ! i had no idea . the one thing that i have heard is that it is better to be an engineer than a fl or mlb player . much more earnings !
8978,yep youre right ! did you hear abou 'the first nfl playoff game ? it happened back in 1932 on an 80yard dirt filled back in chicago somewhere haha
8979,i did n't but i did hear about how the new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden to eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player andc they have to leave if ones one in . that is too much !
8980,"i know is n't that weird ! you would think in this day and age that that would n't be necessary . if i were them i would be really upset , are there any quarterbacks that you like ?"
8981,yes . i do liek tom brady . . i even though there are the haters out ther new with his records ! who would ' too a fan .
8982,yep i agree ! i think he ? s the best too ! what do you think about kellen moore ? he is the only lefthanded quarterback in the entire nfl apparently
8983,i heard about that . did you know tha atom brady 's high school football team never played him . even enough they had the worse season where they never won a game or even scored a touchdown .
8984,"no i did n't know that . that seems very silly . although i wonder if e got better or if his coach was just stupid haha . did you hear about the guy who threw a touchdown pass in the super bowl , to himself ?"
8985,no ! ? i di n't . that would have been something to see . i heard taht baker mayfield the quarterback for oklahoma considered quitting to be a competitive gamer . video games . do you think there is an one in that ?
8986,no i do n't think so . at least not a lot anyway . k trink you made the right choice ! whats weird to me is that only two africanamerican quarterbacks have won the superbowl . i wondr why toast is
8987,not sure . but the huddle was created by a man who was deaf and did not want the other team to read its signals .
8988,"that is really interesting . another interesting fact is that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son 's high school football the , . what a nice dad"
8989,love that ! great talking to you ! have a good night .
8990,"you too ! and make sure to check out the football stadium in al ; en , texas , it cost over 60 billion dollars to build !"
8991,absolutely .
8992,hello do you follow the nfl ?
8993,"i do follow the nfl yeah , i like it , 32 teams , 16 on each division , do yo have a favorite team ?"
8994,i do . i like the steelers . i watch all 16 gems they play a year .
8995,"i dont follow all the games , mostly the playoffs or in the superbowl , did you watch the superbowl this year ?"
8996,i did ! it 's usually head on the first sunday in fe . every year . i have rooting for the patriots .
8997,"i was rooting for the patriots a swell , good thing we won , although it was a boring superbowl , it needed more action"
8998,i did . i wonder if we 'll ever see any female players ny time soon since there 's no rule that does n't allow them to play .
8999,"i dont think i will . that happen , seems like they would be at a disadvantage"
9000,i was thinking maybe as a kicker ? did you know they put tracking chips in the shoulder pads and balls mow to record data ?
9001,"yeah , that could be a good position yeah , and i wonder waht kind of stats are taken out of them , seems really advanced"
9002,almost too advanced if you ask me . maybe the chip in thee calls acre attracted to the chips in the shoulder pads of the wide receivers so the ball will g to them ? lol
9003,"thats a funny theory , could be i wouldnt discord it"
9004,lol did you know that the average career earnings of an engineer are more than that of an average nfl or mob palmer ?
9005,"i didnt know that , wow , that is so crazy pro players earn so much money thats hard to imagine"
9006,i know . i do n't know how they blow through their money like they do . i think they get paid too much for only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay per game .
9007,"only 11 minutes , but still its a game with lots of risks , players end with brain damage and thats a sad thing"
9008,yrs . i agree . did you know taht thee circular huddle that we know was invented by a qb who as deaf so he could play the plays to this teammates through his hands ?
9009,"wow he sure left z legacy behind , that was a clever move , i wonder if they won a superbowl"
9010,i 'm not sure . there is only 1 left handed qb in the nfl kellan moore . are you familiar with him ?
9011,"only one , i think h retired already"
9012,i think so . i 'm not familiar with is . it was nice chatting wit hyou !
9013,case keanu lined up a deal with the broncos and will become their new starter
9014,"really , good for him . he was regarded as the consolation prize in free agnew for teams that needed quarterbacks ."
9015,"this ia keanu 's 4th team . he did really we , i 2017 with the vikings"
9016,"since we are talking about football , did you now that a female could play in the nfl . there is no written rule against it ."
9017,i 've heard that . did you know an average nfl game is only 11 minutes f live gameplay ?
9018,that is cray . i found it unbelievable that the average lifetime earnings on an nfl or mlb player is less an that of an engineer .
9019,yes . are smith was very ontellignet and entered university as a junior and worked on a masters degree before becoming the first 2005 nfl draft pick
9020,"man , athletic an smart . that 's not fair . did you know that the new orleans saints cheerleaders ca n't eat in the same restaurant as the players . even worse , if they are already there and players come in , they have to leave . sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen ."
9021,"i wonder how that can be legal ? interestingly , th university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football team sis completely painted pink ."
9022,that is hilarious . i find it weird that there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl . it is kellan moore .
9023,i did't know but 1960 ' ; s top bowlers made 2x 's the amount of top football stars
9024,not so anymore . do you know the reason they use th circular huddle today . it was started by a deaf quarterback named paul d . hubbard . he needed a way to block teh other team from seeing his signals .
9025,interesting . the junipero serra high school proabably regrets now tha they lost every game and never used their player tom brady who is a 4 time superbowl champ
9026,what coach must suck . i learned that georgia tech beat cumberland 2200 for the highest score eve .
9027,that 's insane . sounds like they should have shown more mercy . espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line for the first one in football games in america
9028,i did not know that . i id knows hat there are chips in the shoulder pads of nfl players to track players every move on the field .
9029,"yes , and also former patriot rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled in his nfl career"
9030,"man , he must have great hand sr young back o the chips , store is one in the football itself . this is to track speed , rotation , adn location ."
9031,that seems too robotic . changing tune gem a bunch .
9032,"i know , but they get data on everything . i heard the quarterback of the university of oklahoma , baker mayfield considered becoming a competitive gamer and quitting football ."
9033,he claims to be able to beat anyone at university of oklahoma oneonone in halo 3
9034,"do you like football , the nfl ?"
9035,"yes , but i do have to admit that i watch more ncaa ."
9036,"it can e more exiting than teh pro league , im tired of teh patriots winning all the time"
9037,much agreed there . did you know tom brady did not even get a chance to play hen hoe was oj v
9038,"i didnt know that , why didnt he get a chance , his the best qb ive seen"
9039,even at age 40 he is really outplaying guys half his age . but it helps tha the haah solid players like greneellks on his team
9040,"yeah he is sure a leyend , 40 years old and still has a great dertemintion , i have to give him that , and green ellis was a great rb alan , never fumbled the ball"
9041,they are definitely making more than stars in the 60 's did . then there were paid the same as top bowlers .
9042,"yeah i dont see bowlers making a lot of money these days , they used to earn more that pro football players"
9043,"espn won an emmy for the yellow pine , i didnt even know there was a category for such a thing ."
9044,"i did hear about that , it was surprising to me as well but i think the creation of the yellow line changed the game forever"
9045,"especially for the home viewers . made things a lot easier , and the regime easier to understand ."
9046,"i agree easier to understand i think its great ow tech is taking over the game , allow 'the user to enjoy it more like those racking chip"
9047,that can also help keep the players safer too .
9048,"i heard some of the rules are changing so maybe with the help of the chips that can happen , sad to see many players ending with brain damage"
9049,"very tries , at least these could measure possible concussions and they could immediately evaluate hem nad take them out to rest it they have one ."
9050,"there i sa chip also on the football all kinds of cool stats are taken out of them , like velocity , rotation speed , location of the ball"
9051,i wonder if they can use those for reviews ? it would certainly speed up the game .
9052,"i think they do , they take the stats such as hunting time and all and what most help , do you know the new orleans saints ? they have this crazy rule against cheerleaders"
9053,yeah i head . i cant believe they have to leave just because a player walks in .
9054,"yah that i really unfair and sexist , that rule should be banned"
9055,"much agreed ! its been great chatting , but i must go . have a great day !"
9056,"engineers earn more than football playes overall , and yeah its been nice to chat as well"
9057,hey there do you ever watch the nfl .
9058,"yes , do you ?"
9059,"yes i do , woul doyou witch it if it had female players ?"
9060,"yes , i woudl that would be interesting ."
9061,"ya apparently there is no rule against it , adn so they would actually be allowed to play !"
9062,"agree , did you know that first playoff game was played in 1932 in chicago stadium ."
9063,"no i did n't , i also did n't know the were 32 different nfl teams"
9064,"yes , how about texas being a big football state ."
9065,"oh it definitely is , what is crazy to me is that n average nfl game only ha eleven minutes of live playing , the rest is just nonsense baba"
9066,"lol , t hey have a high school football stadium that cost 60 million to build !"
9067,"wow that is a lot , did you har how hte huddle was invented btw ?"
9068,"do , how ?"
9069,"up created by a deaf quarterback , he used it to hide his hand signs from the other team"
9070,"interesting , i also find it interesting there is tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads that record their every move ."
9071,"ya that is kind of scary , also scary is that the university of iowa painted the opposing locker rooms pink , id be mad haha"
9072,"yes , its hard for me to believe the stadium flags weighs 1 , 100 pounds ew ow !"
9073,"that is a ton ! do you ike the patriots btw ? they have a running back that has never fumbled the ball , ever !"
9074,"i love the patriots ! , and those flags cost 50 , 000 to make !"
9075,"that 's insane ! i guess bowlers us to make twice what footbal ; player same in the 60 's , so they could n't afford that back then"
9076,"yes , its great to know tha america"
9077,do you ever watch football on tv ? espn won a emmy for creating that yellow line they use during games
9078,"are yoy an nfl fan ? if so , do you remember reggie hush ? i just learned that the rams were borders to pay him 12 . 5 million for his injury in 2015 ."
9079,"yes , i do enjoy nfl and remember reggie bush , but i do n't remember what happened ? was it the all of the rams that 40 to his injury ? 12 . 5 million is a very expensive injury !"
9080,yeah he was pushed out of bounds onto some concrete that winged the field . that 's why the rams were sued 7 . 6 in punitive damages .
9081,"wow ! i do n't remember that injury , did that injury and bush 's career or does he still play for the rams ?"
9082,not sure . i know it was season ending . the rams maintained that getting pushed out of bounds is our part of the game and it 'd how he got so far onto the concrete . they lost that argument .
9083,"bush is one of them is talented running backs in my opinion and the rams should have made it a cafe environment fo them to play , however , i think the players should already know the risks involved for playing such a physical sport , do you play football ?"
9084,"yeah , it sounded liek kind of a freak thing . . . did you know the nfl has no written rule against female players ?"
9085,no i didnt now that but i would imagine the females would have to be in great shape to withstand the physical impact of very heavy and muscular linbeackers .
9086,"yep . to answer your question , i played football in hs . many moons and . . . i 'm also an engineer bur i find t hard to believe that my average lifetime earnings are more that that o fan nfl played ."
9087,"haha , i agree , i also find that hard to believe although it does seem like engineers make a lot but i always hear about football players making millions and millions of doll , ars , i do n't think engineers paychecks are quite that lucrative . unless they use those tracking chip data to negotiate better contracts and salaries ?"
9088,no such luck . y alma master ran up the score of 2220 on cumberland in 1916 . ca n't say i 'm proud of humiliating another team like taht .
9089,"that is embarrassing for both parties , at waht point do you just call it quits ? maybe they shouldve use the tactic that university of iowa ploys in the visiting football teams locker room and painted in completely pick to intimidate them or something . would that work ?"
9090,"i heard they do that to jail cells too , panel colors , l something about a calming effect . speaking of paychecks , in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as football stars . also hard to believe . . ."
9091,"it 's a calming effect t , i thought it was to get into their minds or something . i find that hard to believe , but i also do n't think bowling exists anymore , or at least i do n't think quite as many people watch it as football shih disc considered america 's pastime and in some places , called rugby . i wonder if feral are permitted to play in those ."
9092,i do n't watch it . do hard to believe that here 's only 11 minutes of live gameplay . there is a lot of standing around but i think it ; 's more like 30 minutes of live action .
9093,"only eleven minutes of live gameplay and yet i devote an entire afternoon and evenings watching those games . i never notice that about kellan moore , hd 's the only lefthanded quarterback in the league , do you think taht is an advantage or disadvantage if at all ?"
9094,no kidding . . . the game takes about 3 hours . i would think that by sure odds the would be more lefthanded qbs .
9095,interesting tos vp how the circular huddle still in use to this day was actually created by a deaf quarterback who did n't want the opposing team to read his hand signals . that 's quite impressive .
9096,that is amazing . also amazing it qb alex smith who took so many ap tests in hs that he began college as a junior . smart dude . . .
9097,"not only does he have talent , but he also has brains ! i think he even went on to get a master 's degree or something , i would think not very many players would value education once they 're faced witty million dollar contracts , would you ?"
9098,i would go for the money . one can always go back to school . you 've even an excellent chat partner . thanks .
9099,are you a fan of the nfl ?
9100,"i am a fan of the nfl , 32 teams so far right ?"
9101,"yeah , i think there are 32 . there is only one left handed qb though ."
9102,"only one in the 32 teams ? that is odd , who is he ?"
9103,"yeah , kellan moore ."
9104,do you have a favorite player in the league ?
9105,"no , he 's retired . what about you ?"
9106,"i do , mine is brady , i also like bart mayfield , both are great"
9107,the patriots ?
9108,"yeah brady from the patriots , his my favorite player"
9109,"brady is good , may be the best qb of ll tim e ."
9110,"i agree , to me he is the best , at least the best ever new , a game of football only has 11 minutes of live gameplay isnt that crazy !"
9111,i 'm not a fan of the patriots though . there was some news recently of their own engaging in pfostitution i was surprised to learn he did that .
9112,"he does ? taht doest seem appropriate for the public , that disgusts me , still like the team though"
9113,he busy got arrested for it .
9114,"fit a good thing it happened after the super bowl , a scandal like that can affect the team for sure"
9115,"t is a kind of a scandal . i happened in florida , all over the news ."
9116,i have to watch hte news more often then ! ! how many years did he get or just community service ?
9117,i do n't know . it literally happened last friday .
9118,"he is a public figure so they might make an simple out of him , did you know about the saints and the rule they have against cheerleaders ?"
9119,"yeah , they arleaedy did by embarrassing him ."
9120,"hi , how are you ?"
9121,"hey i 'm good , is there a favorite quarterback of your that you like ?"
9122,i like jay cutler . what about you ?
9123,"ya i like tom brady myself , have you seen the video of him kissing is kid ? its really weird haha"
9124,"ha ! yes , i have seen that . he seems like a weird dude . who does n't eat strawberries ?"
9125,"haha i know right ? also weird , kellan moore is left handed , the only one in the nfl"
9126,tom brady did n't even play on his high hoop jv team . . .
9127,"oh wow did n't know tha t , also did n't know there 's no rule against women players in the n . f . l ."
9128,alex smith is so smart he entered college as a junior ! i barely graduate hs . . .
9129,wow taht genius 2 strange to me that a average nfl game only has 11 minutes of gameplay though
9130,i am a bears fan adn it greens like the game lasts so much longer than that .
9131,"ya it seems like it right , did you hear about the controversy with the saints cheerleaders ?"
9132,"no , what happened ?"
9133,"ya they cant enter a restaurant too there is a saints player there already , it seems really outdated"
9134,"yeah . an nfl hat is teh rules , it should eb whoever got there first was 5o stay ."
9135,"yup , or if anything neither persons hold have to leave that is just a dumb rule"
9136,"there is no written rule against women fro playing though . just eating at the same restaurant ; , ."
9137,"i know right , dud you see the the nfl uses tracking chips on the field ?"
9138,i hope they use the data to make the game safer . . . it only has 11 minutes of playing time so wet 's make them take .
9139,"haha i know right , but ya they can track player moment as well as ball rotation , pretyy cool !"
9140,nice chatting with you !
9141,do 'you like football ?
9142,"if , especially college . i went to an art conference school . ed oliver recently single gamer record"
9143,for which team ed oliver plays ?
9144,i thin kid 's a nose guard for houston . navy prepared an offensive game plan just to counter him .
9145,"i do n't follow much college football , there are so many teams , even the army and the navy have one . what do you like about college football ?"
9146,it 's kids that are n't getting paid a billion dollars and do n't feel during the anthem . it 's fun to watch the qb alike alex smith .
9147,"th nfl has changed a lot , in the 60s pro bowlers here paid ore than pro footballers ."
9148,"yeah , that wo n't happen again . so much funny stuff happens in college football . like the u of iowa games visiting teams use a pink locker room ."
9149,"but there are stills injuries i college football , do n't you think it is an issue with the sport ?"
9150,"it 's an issue with any sport , e . g . , tennis e3lbow , . it 's getting more hitech to prevent that add improve performance . he nl uses chips in shoulder pads"
9151,"but football is more demanding physically on the players , that is why there are only 16 games per seasons in the nfl ."
9152,we 've turned into a nation o fwussied . i hope we do n't get into a real war like wii . football is ok if you 're in shape eli aaron donald .
9153,"a strong lady is important , but a strong mind 9s better , baker mayfield wanted to be a professional video game player , because nobody could beat at halo , he would not have lasted long in the nfl ."
9154,"yeah , we are a nation with strong thumb . i 'm not sure video games build an intellect . football requires a strong mind and body . alex smith got his bachelors in two years ."
9155,"but being drafted first e knew he was good ad team wanted him , i think most of the football player would cut short their education to be drafted in the nfl , there are only 32 teams ."
9156,i would . the opportunity cost in too high . unless you are in one of the academies like the navy . they lose a lot excuse of the rights of football with the rights of the academy .
9157,"and the average lifetime earning of a pro footballer is not that high , it is less han the average of an engineer ."
9158,"irma thing a hard time believing that . i mean a guy like oliver . if a can make investments at all , i ai n't seeing it . surely that does n't include coaches like niumatolo who would make millions in the nfl ."
9159,"most o 'the players do n't have multimillion contracts , and people work till at least 65 , and engineers have their biggest salaries in heir later years ."
9160,engineer salaries plate . . . i know from experience . i went to georgia tech and i can believe htey once ran up a score o 2220 against cumberland . litle ashamed . . .
9161,"at least they have a record , but not a good one . thanks for tone conversation ."
9162,are you a football fan ?
9163,"yes , ia m , are you ? in the 60 's top bowlers made twice as much as football stars ."
9164,i am . wow . times have certainly changed or
9165,yes the ave . how about that score of 2220 in 1916 with georgia tech defeating cumberland .
9166,i did n't know about that . how does a team even score that many points during one game ?
9167,i do n't know ! that was in 1916 ! i would think would stop at some point .
9168,you would think so . did you hear what hte university of iowa di duo the visiting team 's locker room ?
9169,"yes , painting it pink ! not sure how much would affect the game . ore of a joke ."
9170,seems to be . some kind of mind trick . did you also know that espn invented the yellow line that we see on tv king the first down ?
9171,they won an emmy for that ! pretty good benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football .
9172,thats very impressive . have n't he a patriots r b ?
9173,"i thought so , 11 minutes us the average play game !"
9174,"hoe s tha possible ? i know there were a lot of commercials , play reviews , flags , and such but wow that 's very litte e ."
9175,seems like its more than 11 min . but the say the average . there 's no rule against women players im the a l .
9176,i did not know that either . with the size of the men on field it would be difficult . i can certainly lee a merle kicker .
9177,"yeah , maybe the kicker , if she 's good . engineers lifetime earnings are higher than a nfl player !"
9178,oh wow ! i would definitely rather be an engineer then . it 's much easier on your body .
9179,"yet , not worth all the damage and pain you 'll get when you get older . gobbling around with bad knees et c ."
9180,i agree . did you know that in the nfl there are tracing chips int he players hsoulcer pads and in the football ?
9181,"yes , that 's got to be helpful . i wonder i that helped with the inflated football ? good chat ! !"
9182,"ha ha , ot sure . id o wonder why they do n't use them instead of just reviews for play calls if that have that data ."
9183,hello . are you a big football fan ? i ca n't wait for the nfl tos that again .
9184,"i love then fl , i cant wait either ! which of the 32 team is your favorite"
9185,"i used to be a rams fan until hey moved but now i lean towards the ravens . i really like their quarterback , lamar jackson ."
9186,he is good and so fast ! what do you thunk about 'the saints ?
9187,"i think that are exciting to watch , but do n't particularly agree with their treatment of tshirt cheerleaders . did you know that saints cheerleaders are forbidden fro reading in the same restaurant as any nfl player , and if htey are already eating and a player walks in , they are required to leave ?"
9188,"i did not know what , it seems liek it is sexist ! they need chips put in them apparently , just like nfl shoulder cards brave"
9189,"it 's amazing the technology that goes into nfl equipment . the 's great engineering . speaking of engineers , the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings if an nfl player . crazy !"
9190,they are worth every penny ! did you know in the 1960s bowler spade more money than nfl players . they have come a long way !
9191,"that 's crazy . things have really changed in the game . it 's hard to believe , but one college football game i 1913 hid a score of 2220 . times have really changed !"
9192,"i howard abou that game , who played ? i woudl have quit at 1000 lol"
9193,"i definitely would have when up at 1000 ! i wonder how many quarterbacks they used . junipero serra high school mj football had a historically bad season where they never scored a touchdown , yet enter attempted to start their backup qb . the backup just happened to be tom brady !"
9194,"what q ! ! ! imagine if tom brady played for tha team , they would have won 222223 ! that is awesome . are you an alex smith fan ?"
9195,yah . i hope he recovers from his injury . he 's a really smart quarterback . he entered college as a junior because heat of so many ap classes . that is one smart gut !
9196,y they is so sad t ! i thin phd got his first degree as a sophomore in college ! then became the 1 pick !
9197,"baker mayfield was the first pick last year , but applied himself a bit differently . one once considered quitting football to go into competitive gaming . that 's crazy . do you have a favpiteq quarterback ?"
9198,"wow , i heard he liked halo 3 . i could heat him ! i liked michael vick back in the day . he was my favorite lefty quarterback , you ?"
9199,there 's not many lefty quarterbacks . kellan moore is the only lefty in the nfl now .
9200,"wow , i did n't now that . quarterbacks must be a right handers game ! do you watch college football much ?"
9201,a little . i actually used to work in college athletics . there are some interesting things about college football . the visiting locker room at the university of iowa is painted completely pink . there 's so many strange things about football !
9202,"i live down the street from that stadium . it is so interestin g , it is used to psych out the other team ! goood chatting with you !"
9203,good chatting with you ! wave at the kids in the hospital for me !
9204,hey there who is your favorite quarterbacks ? i know that i like tom brady a lot it he wins al . the time haha
9205,"for all time it would eb johnny unites . now , it 's thames . i do respect a , ex smith a lot ."
9206,"yeah alex smith seems really smart . hd was working on his master 's before he finally was drafted , and he passed guy of a lot of college classes due to his high school ap scores"
9207,i do admire that . i used o play in hs and i never knew th circular huddle was created fo . deaf qb .
9208,no i did n't know that either . eh used the huddle to block the other team from seeing his hand signals which is actually genius
9209,also something to be admired . . . did you know that kellan moore is the only lefthanded q bin the nfl ? he 's dallas right ?
9210,"i think so . and yes that is crazy , it 's also crazy that baker mayfield was going to be a professional video game player back in the day lol e definitely made the right decision playing for the nfl"
9211,"yeah , did you hear that th eu . of iowa has a pink other room for the visiting football team ? does that work ?"
9212,"yeah i wonder if that increased or decreased their winning percentage ? i also wonder why bowlers were paid more than top football players back in hte sixties , bowling must have been very popular back then"
9213,i think it was . i can ; t see how tht could be considered a better spectator sport . i went to georgia watch and i did n't know we beat poor cumberland 2220 in 1916 .
9214,"haha that 's funny ! that 's such a blowout i feel bad for cumberland . i also think it 's interesting that espn won an emmy for creating te yellow line that you see when you watch a football game on tv , it ' ; s a very genius invention"
9215,i love that yellow line ! it makes the game more exciting . i ca n't believe the former pat greenellis never ever fumbled in he nfl .
9216,yeah that 's a very impressive statistic ! what do you think of the nfl by the way ? did you know that female players are actually allowed to play ?
9217,i like the chiefs . yes i did know that . there will probably be af female kicker before too long . i heard that there is only 11 minute so five gameplay in an average nfl game . that seems way short . . .
9218,"o agree that does seem short . and i also think it 's weird that an engineer wil , l mad more in his or her lifetime than an nfl was , that does n't seem right but also i guess nfl players dont ' pals fo their entire lives"
9219,"yeah , i am an engineer a that 's the only thing that makes sense . maybe one of be both , testing chips in shoulder pads ?"
9220,yes you should be an engineer for testing shoulder chips and also an nfl player to maximize your income haha ! its crazy the stats they can get from those smell hips thee days
9221,ha ! i would o the chip thing maybe but i would die on the field . i 'd rather hang with the cheerleaders rich would be frowned upon in ne orleans .
9222,"yeah i agree , but i did silly ho wthe cheerleaders wold have to leave a restaurant if you walked into their lol taht definitely seemed sexist these days"
9223,"yeh , i ca n't even see a high school requiring that . c'mon these peopel are grown ! you are an excellent chat partner . thanks !"
9224,thank you you are as well ! and definitely keep your engineering brain working on some more tracking chips because the nfl will buy them !
9225,"hey there , are you into football at all ?"
9226,i am although i do not watch it all the time . did you know that snoop dogg wrote fight song for his son 's football team ?
9227,"no , i did n't . but that seems like something he 'd do . he seems to be a great father , in my opinion n ."
9228,"yep , any parent who has time tim tos write a song for tshirt children s very dedicated ."
9229,"oh here is an interesting factoid about football . the circular huddle used in today 's american footbal was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf qb , so the other team could n't read his hand signals ."
9230,really ? that is super smart . there are also tracking chips placed ino the nfl uniforms to track player movement . that sounds super advanced
9231,"yeah i heard somewhere that they have tracking chips in the footballs too , i believe ."
9232,th tracking chips in the footballs are apparently used to track its velocity and rotation .
9233,oh that 's really big tech ! baker mayfield a bbq for hte university of oklahoma once considered quitting football to pursue full time competitive gaming . haha ! he claims he can beat anyone eat the university of oklahoma at halo 3 !
9234,haha . i would like to challenge him . 14 out of the world arrests stadiums are african football ones ! they are enormous !
9235,"oh yeah and somewhere i read that the american flags in those stadiums are like over 1 , 000 pounds and cost 50 , 00 to make . that 's nut s !"
9236,"i know right ? 50 , 000 dollars can buy you a luxury car ! why would they spend that on a farm ?"
9237,"i do n't know , but it droves me nuts thinking about all the i could do with that money !"
9238,"same . furthermore , ah nigh school footballs stadium ina allen , texas costed more than 60 million dollars ! i think that that is more tuna the budge of our entire school district for the next decade combined 12"
9239,"yeah imagine how may cars lou could buy int tha t ! heh . so , the junipero serra high school jv football team recorded a historically bad season , when they failed to with a game or even score epa touchdown yet they never attempted to start their backup qb , who happened to be tom brady ! 4 time superbowl champion ! c ram !"
9240,"i know , crazy right ? the highest paid across all of the us departments of defense employees are three football coaches ."
9241,"wow football coaches that are us department o defense employers ! weird ! so , i 'm thinking that they get paid quite well ! the highest scorer over , in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 . how is that even possible ! crazy big loss !"
9242,imagine losing that badly . kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback kin the nfl .
9243,"interesting ! i could be wrong , but i thought i 'd recalled hearing somewhere that left handed people are more likely to play sports . something like that . i 'd b interested to look at those stats again . that 's an interesting topic to me . i 'm righthanded . what about you ?"
9244,"i am also right handed , although most people re right handed . personally i find being left handed would be a disadvantage as most houses are food only right handed people"
9245,oh that would be a pain to deal with . also those people that can use both had ! i wonder if some can use them both equally as good ! that 's very interesting ! and what if a difference is there between those people versus seuss right or left handed people . are they average or are they twice as good at everything ? haha . it 's been fun talking with you ! thanks for the great conversation !
9246,agreed . thank you for our time and have a nice nigh t !
9247,"alex smith to th redskins ! if only i knew the significance of that , are you able to enlighten me ."
9248,"has ! he was a long time qb for the chiefs , but they did not want to pay him . he wound up being traded to the redskins and signing a 94 million extension !"
9249,i think i 'd be reluctant to pay him at that rate . i hope th redskins get their money 's worth .
9250,"thay did not ! in fact , the young kid what took over at qb or kansas city won the nba mvp this year ! !"
9251,that 's awesome . he was probably somewhat cheaper too . do did the redskin end up doing this year ?
9252,much cheaper ! they were doin decent but then alex smith got hurt and hi backup did too . they wound up missing the playoffs .
9253,"you 'd think i 'd know , i spent ten years in dc . live in north east ohio now , i understand that mayfield guy is promising ."
9254,"yea , the browns fan seem to love him ! mahomes , the kc rookie , is africa american . hopefully he can win a super bowl because only two have ever done it ."
9255,from my little understanding the browns would be happy not to have a losing season . are there theories why that stat you say is true ?
9256,"i just dont in a lot of african a , americans played qb until somewhat recent . a lot of oddities with qbs , kellen moore is the only left handed quarterback in the entire nfl 12"
9257,"interesting , i know in mays ; sports it can be an advantage to be left handed . when we think of quarterbacks often there is an image of the as always white , unfortunately ."
9258,i agree . such a significant position in the game . they touch the ball basically every play .
9259,"tthat much i do know . believe me , i 've tried to get into football , but with an average game seeming to take three hours i just do n't have the time ."
9260,"it does take forever . it is crazy how popular it is , especially at the college level . 14 of the world 's 25 largest stadiums are college team stadiums !"
9261,"and what , they play about ten home game , amazing . i did see a game at indiana state once , that stadium seemed pretty big to me ."
9262,"big and expensive ! the army , navy , and air force football coaches are the highest paid department tofu defense employees !"
9263,"iman ' r that kind of the same fo the colleges , bo ne makes more money than th football coach ? still not in the same league as alex smith hand his extension ."
9264,"yes , the roaches are always among hte highest paid people int he state . t has come a long way from the firt nfl playoff game being played on a 80 year dirt field in a hocky stadium ."
9265,"yes , the the times where bowlers made more than football players . there must be some very envious bowlers out there now ."
9266,"that is hard to even conptehejnd ! now you have thing school stadiums that seat 18 , 009 and cost 60 million o bill ! !"
9267,"i wonder how man people cake to cumberland 's next game in 1916 , after they lost 2220 . not sure i 'd want to go back ."
9268,"haha , it would take a diehard ! it was great chatting with you today !"
9269,you too
9270,do you like baker mayfield ? i think is a great qb
9271,i went to oklahoma university and have listened to or watched very game since i was ten years old . he is a spectacular qb to watch and i was glad he was drafted number one last year .
9272,"he is right , he was first in the top 10 nfl draft so thats something"
9273,"yes . cleveland picked him number one . they have some other good young players , so they could get pretty good pretty quickly ."
9274,"he was the heisman trophy inner , his pick was unprecedented , the browns kept it as a secret code ."
9275,"he came in in one 3 when cleveland nwas behind and won teh game . he was th starter after that . i live in phoenix x , and arizona picked josh rosie at number 10 . the offensive line was so awful that he lost confidence adn the season went on ."
9276,"the selection provided mayfield with bid goals , he won the trophy and then h had a monumental task ahead do him , i heard e bad a bad start"
9277,"he wash creat in he came in on that first game , but had a few shaky ga , mesh and rehab finished strong . he cried when the browns owner called to tell him that he would be the number one pick ."
9278,"i bet tht was a special moment . his life , qb have a tough luck in the team though , the team is considered or was considered a qb graveyard ,"
9279,it sure is ; since 1999 they hav only had one qb who started every game of a single season .
9280,"tough luck , if the us doesn have regularly then the rest of the team is going to suffer , to think baker mayfield almost buti football to become pro gamer"
9281,"true . he might have made 1 million playing halo , but made 50 million by signing that pro contract ."
9282,"1 mill ; ion wow , thats a lot of moeny for video games , but yeah , sounds like he made the right decision in the end , 50 million is a lot more"
9283,you know that alex smith took so many ap tests that he was a junior the first time he stepped on his college campus .
9284,"sounds like he is a really smart qb , i didnt know what , i bet few player said something similar"
9285,i would agree . that is a lot of advanced placement . he was studying for his easter 's degree by the time he turned pr .
9286,"so he also has a masters degree , thats impressive , maybe even a phd ?"
9287,"i doubt the phd . since there are 32 nfl teams , 1 are disappointed every year"
9288,"31 disappointed end the patriots is usually the happy 32 team , they win all the time brady is one of the big reasons"
9289,that i sure . he has mow won 6 super bowls . those of . games only have 11 minutes of game action .
9290,"only 11 minutes ? that seems unfair ,"
9291,"hi , how are you ? i have chatted much in recent days about football . you ?"
9292,"hello there , i like football , but have been watching basketball lately . di you watch these superbowl this year ?"
9293,no i didnt have a chance to see the sb . i heard that it was a bit slow .
9294,"yeah it sure was , the first 3 quarters there was no much offended or scoring at all . not very exciting , not like the yet before i will say ."
9295,"the year before had a big comeback , right ?"
9296,"yeah the eagles and the pats had a good back and forth going , it the eagles qb making some crazy plays to win the game ."
9297,"the eagles had not won the sb before , right t ? that was their first , i think"
9298,"yeah good call , it was their first . i think htey deserved ot as was n't going to feel sorry for the pats , since they have dominated the last 10 years or so ."
9299,"yeah , brady has six rings now ? someone else deserves a turban"
9300,"i think he does yeah , h e will go down as one of hte greatest . i was hoping the kc chiefs would have won i t , with the young star qb ."
9301,i wonder what is going to happen next year . the nfl needs to deal with the problem of concussions and injury .
9302,"they sure do , i hope all of the tracking technology can be used to improve player safety . did you see the movie concussion , with wil smith ?"
9303,"i did n't . does he play a doctor or something ? there was an siberian guy doing research on cte , rings ?"
9304,"yep , he plays a doctor that does extensive research on cte 1bn da lot of peopel involved in the league do n't want to accent his findings till years later ."
9305,"yeah , there is too much money to be made . player injuries get i nthe way of tat ."
9306,yeah they sure do . did you know that there is no rule regarding elle playes in thiel league ?
9307,i heard that . i wonder if a woman will ever show up at tryout .
9308,"i hope so , but i think the system we save in place , well actually see do n't ask epa sistem in place for girls to work there way up to the pro level ."
9309,"yeah , t here is no high school or college bail for girls . they cant prepare for the pros ."
9310,"yep , taht is why it will be hard , but once one does , i think it will open the floodgates for all types of women 's programs which would be cool ."
9311,"i would like to see more women in sports . athletics is important for many reason i anyway , grea treat !"
9312,"yeah i agree there , and same to do , i hop you have a good day !"
9313,hi ! do you follow the rams at all ? i 'm glad sean mcvie became wthe top candidate for coach of the year . . deserves it after what he ' stole in as first season with the rest !
9314,ca n't say that i follow the ram do . i do think that sean did a great job though . i could definitely see hime inning tthat award . his team is the number 3 seed in the nfc playoff well now . so that 's definitely good
9315,so very true . it 's certainly rare to do what he 's one like folding jaded geoff to become a franchise 1b and turning todd hurley into n mvp candidate especially ish year one !
9316,"tell let me ask you this , d o you like football at ? personally u only watch it a litle bit , bu by favorite quarterback is tom brady , ho 's your favorite quarterback ?"
9317,id o a i 'm in agreement with you . tom brady is definitely my favorite quarterback or ' qb ' . can you believe his jv high team refuse duo start him when he was a back up while hte team never won or scored a touchdown ? that is unbelievable !
9318,wow that 's insane ! i wonder why they did n't hat way haha . another thing i did n't know is that a deaf quarterback created the huddle . he used it so that the other team could not see his hands signing
9319,"that makes so such sense and i 'm sure coaches and players over the years appreciate him for that ! even left handed quartebracis like kellan moore , who just so happens to us the only left handed qb in the nfl today !"
9320,that is shocking ! do you think it gives him an advantage or a disadvantage ? have you heard about baker mayfield as well ? ne was almost a professional gamer but switched over to playing for the nfl
9321,"i 'm sure it probably gives him an advantage since it 's ' different ' . but i did n't know that about baker . that was a wise choice , i 'm sure in terms of pay . even though engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of nl and mlb players , not i would guess nfl payers make more than pro gamers . ha !"
9322,haha i think your ' e right ! a lot of these quarterbacks are really talented though . did you hear about alex smith ? he got his fouryear degree in only 2 year sand was working on his master 's before joining the nfl
9323,wow ! he must be a genius . people like him haven the brains or talent while people like benjarvus greenellis have such unique talent like never fumbling the football in their entire pros career !
9324,that is an incredible feat ! another incredible feet would b if a female player joined th nfl . apparently there is no rule that does n't allow for that
9325,"that is true . makes you wonder why one had never been drafted or picked up by a team . the nfl ; gameplay is only an average 11 minutes , so you 'd think they woulda t least sign a female to be a kicker or something !"
9326,haha yeah wish ! i would see a female kicker . did yo hear about the tracking chips that they put in players shoulder pads though ? hopefully they take those off show they cant be tracked when they 're not playing haha
9327,"i , no kidding ! no telling what those players do after a game ! ha ! then again , t hey coudl track saints players to see if cheerleaders are dining in the same restaurant as them , which is forbidden . ca you believe that ?"
9328,"i ca n't believe that , in this day and age that seems completely unnecess on a separate note , did you ever bowl by chance ? i guess top bullying players ear more than top football players back in the 1960s"
9329,"are you serious ? bowling must have been major back in those days . but i still do n't thin kit 's as unbelievable as georgia tech beating cumberland 2220 abc in 911 , white to this day is the record for the highest score in football ."
9330,"that is an amazing record ! i wish that we had a video of that game because 9 would hav sailed to have seen that . imagine how bad you would feel if you were a cumberland fan that day hah am , i wonder if they had a lefthanded quarterback like kellen moore maybe that was their secret haha"
9331,ha ! no kidding . it would be interesting to see ! almost like the university of iowa 's visiting team locker room being painted completely pink . i bet that 's a sight to behold ! ha !
9332,haha that would be a crazy thing to see ! i always wonder if that woudl make me play better or worse though ! what do you think ?
9333,it 's tough to say . i suppose it could be motivational or depressing ! but let 's be honest : it is n't as innovative as esp creating the yellow first down line ! ha ! they totally deserved a emmy for that . well it was great chatting with you tonight !
9334,"goods trying , are you a football fan ?"
9335,good morning ! i sure am ! never miss my team game during the regular season . how about you ?
9336,"i am a big fan as well . i root for the eagles , who is your favorite tema ?"
9337,"uh oh , we may have some trouble ! im a patriots fan over here haha . although i dont hate the eagles at all , i think theyre a good team too"
9338,i guess as a patriots fan you 're probably use to everyone hating your team . i can admit it 's purely out of jealousy though so you have that goin or you .
9339,"yea thats it true , i guess thats a good thing . you guys beat us last year though in the super bowl"
9340,that was really exciting for us last year . it felt good to beat one of the best team you there . it was a kid bit of revenge from our previous match up . how year ' x super box was a lot more boring .
9341,"i agree with that 00 percent , what a score fest ! at least both teams showed up finally in the 4th quarter"
9342,how much longer do you think the patriots dynasty as ? they have n't really planned for the end of brady 's case yet or
9343,"i think either this year or next year will be his last . and who knows , with those issues with robert kraft there might be some ownership shake which could lead to some new thoughts on the coaching staff"
9344,"i do n't think kraft is really looking at anything besides a fine and suspension . his public image definitely took a big hit , but a few other where have been involved in some shady business an still knw their teams ."
9345,"this true . its just such a silly thing he did . so many questions ! ah well . did you know the highest scoring game was 2220 , i wonder what how the other tea melt after that one"
9346,the defense had to be exhausted ! t he offense was probably ready for another game .
9347,haha i wonder if the offense ever even unit he field !
9348,with that some i have to believe there was some defensive touchdowns by the other team . if not they were on the field for 3 plays at a time .
9349,thats crazy . why do you think university of iowa paints the visiting footballs teams lower room pink ?
9350,"it they think that 's going to throw teh other head off their game , the are probably mistaken ."
9351,"hey might think it has some sort of psychological , effect , but im not sure it works"
9352,i do n't think ikea has any national championships so i ' going to chain it p as a failure .
9353,"haha 8 agree , they should , d reevaluate their strategy"
9354,"it was fun chattin fooball with you , hopefully we ge 'the third match up in the super bowl so we can break the tie between tha eagles and patriots !"
9355,lets hope ! it ; l be zen itnerestuing game
9356,good morning ! do you like an or or watch football ?
9357,goood morning . i love football . what about you ?
9358,same here . i think that teh 17 was regular season is just too short .
9359,i think so too . wish they would make it longer . did you know kellan moore is the only left headed qb in the nfl ?
9360,no i didnt ? ! that is really surprising ! i know they used to have a deaf quarterback which is also surprising to me .
9361,i heard that 's how the circular huddle came about so they other team could n't see hte play calling .
9362,"i 've heard that too . you know , i had always thought the huddle was just part of the game so teh team could call the play ."
9363,i thought s too . baker mayfield once thought about quitting football to pursue ac career in professional gaming .
9364,"bader mayfield has so much confidence he cna probably do anything and be good at it ! i mean , he has made the claim that he can beat anyone at is school at one on one halo 3 ."
9365,ia greet . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he was automatically a junior when he started college .
9366,he must be really smart ans high achieving ! so does that mean he was only in college for two years before being crafted ?
9367,"i think so , get not too sure on that ."
9368,i guess h nwas younger than other drafted . yet hew is still just as good a 'the rest . what do you think about women becoming planets ?
9369,"i could see them being a kicker , but the 's about it . what about you ?"
9370,i do n't know . i know that by rule they have to meet th nfl 's eligibility requirements . i guess if they can do that then i can see them being players . i just do n't know if any teams would they them .
9371,i agree . did you know the average nfl game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
9372,"no , its seems like so much longer . i guess that means that most o 'the three hours is just commercials then ?"
9373,commercials and play calling .
9374,that could explain why the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are more than a player 's .
9375,i think so too . nfl player careers are usually short lived .
9376,yeah they are . have you heard about the saint 's rules for cheerleaders ?
9377,hve you seen lamar jackson play this season ?
9378,he did good agains cincinnati . seems like they have to much money invested i first round draft picks to not start them these days .
9379,blacc has a large contract as well . 26 . 5 million .
9380,"that could give the ravens a reason to trade him , i them some space in the salary cap ."
9381,yeah there are n't many super bowl mvp winning qb 's available for needy teams either
9382,if jackson keeps running he may not have that long in the league . maybe they should hold on to franco another season .
9383,true his teammate was asl a heisman winning running qb . insurance is always good to have
9384,did you hear about ozil newcomer stepping aside ?
9385,"i have , he has been a pretty good gm in his time . he helped build 2 super bowl winning team"
9386,the new gm will probably dang to capitalize on jackson ' talent .
9387,he 's taking over a pretty talented time . as long as everything stays stable . coach harbaugh might be one though
9388,"yeah , he could go to another of thye 3 teams i suppose ."
9389,the super bowl is coming this weekend . its played on the 1st sunday of february
9390,i usually watch for the commercials . the average game has only 11 minutes of gameplay . neat 's a lot of commercials .
9391,it is ! think how many commercials oculd have aired in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220
9392,"o guess there was n't a mercy rule then either . i wonder what they would have thought of our televised version of the game . i 'the superimposed yellow line , that 's some intereting technology espn introduced ."
9393,they won an emmy for that !
9394,i guest hey give those out to anyone these days . technology is pervasive . baker mayfield almost quit football to be ac competitive gamer . probably less hamstrinb injuries there .
9395,a heisman winning . halo player . i wonder how good h really was
9396,as good as patriots hack greenellis who never fumbled once ?
9397,lets nor go that far
9398,did you see nag of the super bowl last sunday ? it rapped off an interesting nfl season .
9399,"i did watch that , i like it , what is shocking i stat the avg . nfl game only has 11 minutes of actual game p , laying , that seems low"
9400,"that would explain why i get bored watching sometimes . it also explains why the announcers try to be such persona ; cities , i suppose ."
9401,"yup i agree , i watched th super bowl but i do n't follow sports , i dot hey 're kid of boring , what would be progressive is allowing female players in the nfl"
9402,"allowing female players would be good . there have been a few in college , so maybe someday one or more will make the transition . the nfl has no rule against them , but does n't have the best trick record for dealing with women , especially cheerleaders ."
9403,"right that is true , i saw a saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if a nfl player is predsnet , taht seem every silly to me"
9404,reading thati aide me shake my head . it i 2019 after all . things sure have changed since the early days when nfl players made less money than professional bowlers .
9405,"can they definitely have , also szurpisng i stat over their lifetime , an fl player will make les than an engineer , on average"
9406,"more joey , less pounding on the body . engineering sounds like the way to go ! although , to brady has made a a pretty good career for himself , even though it may not have started sow el l ."
9407,"ya you 're right , i read that hi wife actually makes more than he does"
9408,"that was a bit odd , you 're right . brady seems to be a lightning rod for a lot of things . hi success has created a lot of haters . six rings is pretty amazing no matter who you are ."
9409,"yup i agree he deserves respect , if i were him i 'd always give the ball to greenellis though , that guy has never fumbled tie ball"
9410,that is a amazing stat . and you 're right . every quarterback need a running back he ca depend on .
9411,"ya definitely , do you watch football on tv or in persona ? i guess espn won an emmy for making 'the yellow line to create the first down on tv"
9412,"i have never been to a live game , ho about you ? i watch sporadically here at home . espn has indeed done some innovative high , for sure , but sometimes their announcers are hard to listen to for very long ."
9413,"ya i do n't even have cable but if i do watch sports it is on tv , did you hear how the university of iowa painted teh opposing teams locker room ? that would have me ploy a lo harder haha"
9414,"yeah , that is an interesting bit of gamesmanship . i ca n't imagine sitting in there very long . it would drive me crazy . anything for a mental edge , i suppose ."
9415,"ya i suppose , have you ever heard of the highest scoring football game of all time ? it was 2220 haha"
9416,how does that happen ? ? i ca n't even imagine what that was like to watch . how bad did the losing team have to be ?
9417,"haha nope i do n't like any sports so no worries ' and ya the teams were georgia teh and cumberland , cumberland must have been devastated afterwards haha"
9418,"devastated , embarrassed , disheartened . i wonder if they even have football anymore . maybe competitive gaming wigg be more their specialty . apparently some people actually make a living going that ."
9419,"ive hard or that , i think baker mayfield was almost a competitive gamer right ? sort that he chose football instead ahha"
9420,"do you have a favorite quarterback in teh nfl ? i do n't watch football much , but i do like tom brady and a few others ."
9421,"i do , tom brady of course , i 'm a fan of the patriots , alex smith is another great qb"
9422,kellan moore is also really cool becaue one 's the only lefty . i always hear his name and have to think a minute . i get this football player mixed up with kellyanne conway of all people .
9423,"is he really the only lefty in the league ? i thought there were at least a couple more , do you now ho invented the circular huddle ?"
9424,"no , i 'm not sure who did . i always enjoy watching the huddles in the football games on tv . i like to imagine ad limb what hey 're saying and thinking ."
9425,"the huddle was invented by karl . d . hubbard , h e was a deaf qb ."
9426,wow m that 's really smart of him . its align how it caught on and is still used today in football games end in the nfl .
9427,being deaf sure wass a big disadvantage but maybe his other senses heighten and he was able to play better hanks to that .
9428,that sounds reasonable . i 've heard of that happening with peopel who lose one dense . did you know that tom brady started out as kind of a failure at football ? he was only a backup to begin with .
9429,he was ? its kind of hard to imagine that i bet his team had a great qb and also a great team .
9430,"wel l , i guess the quarterback and the whole team of brady ' e was n't doing too well and he really should have bee not in but for some reason they did n't let him play , evade . sad football season for him ."
9431,"i bet that made him improve his skills , he definitely showed his coach"
9432,"yes , i bet the coach was embarrassed after that ! lol quarterbacks seem to be in the news a lot . i never hear of the wield oral kickers or something , do you ?"
9433,"no not really , they are only in the news when they miss an important shot lil , did you hear about the emmy espn won because of the yellow first down line"
9434,"that 's amazing ! i wonder how much that increased their income ? do you like soccer aka football , do ?"
9435,"i do like it , its one of my favorite sports as well i also like rugby"
9436,"i use too play football soccer a lot when i was a kid a i was pretty good at it and always seemed to lose balls over fences , though . lol"
9437,"yeah hat happened to me as well i just watch i no lol , do you lke rugby as well ? what about gaelic football ?"
9438,i do liked rugby but it 's hard to catch a match on tv without cable . i think ive patched a match or to on youtube . i definitely watch fl highlights on youtube a lot also .
9439,"u do that as well i just do n't have the time to watch th games , . they last a long time and all the ads just drive me crazy ."
9440,"it 's hard to believe football season for nfl is only september through december . i wish we could have it year round . i suess the football players need some time to rest and practice , too , though ."
9441,"how 's it going , do you liek football ? a lot of people are speculating bill belichick is in to leave the patriots soon ."
9442,i do n't watch a lot of football . what position does he play ?
9443,"he 's the coach of the new england patriots , theres rumors that him and his qb tom brady are not getting along despite all the success they 've had"
9444,"aw , that 's not good . speaking of football , did you know iowa states locker room is painted pink ?"
9445,"yea lol , i guess iowa is really trying o play mind games on the visiting tea with the pink locker room , or they really like pink"
9446,"yeah , seems like hey 're messaging with them . i think pink is supposed to be a calming color ."
9447,i wonder if georgia tech did nothing to mess with cumberland before the game they beat the 2220
9448,if not then they must have played a good game ! did you know that in the 1960s the top bowlers made twice as much as football players ?
9449,"no , that 's pretty crazy but the average engineer also makes more than the average nfl player over sa lifetime"
9450,that 's pretty interesting . the nfl allows women gift hey meet she requirements .
9451,"interesting , since there no rule forbidding them i think it 's possible to see a female placekicker"
9452,definitely seems possible . i an average nfl game there is only 11 minutes of live game play ! i never would have guess that !
9453,"yea , it ' shocking how many injuries occur in only 11 minutes of actual gameplay"
9454,absolutely ! hands how much work goes into so little actual lame play time . the nfl also tracks players movements through chips un their shouldve reads .
9455,"that 's pretty crazy , its lso crazy that kellan moore is the only left handed qb int he nfl"
9456,that 's interesting . the junipero serra highschool jv football team and a historically bad season which they failed toe run score a touch down . ouch .
9457,"yea , hopefully the coach of th jv team got fire for not even giving tom brady a start"
9458,the new orleans cheerleaders are banned from eating at hte same place as the nfl player . that 's weird .
9459,"that makes no sense , sapiens cheerleaders should bey able to eat wherever they want regardless if there are players there or not"
9460,"yeah , it does see , m a little strange hat the cheer ; leaders have to leave even if they were thee first ."
9461,"well i got to o , nice chatting with you"
9462,"hi , h ow are you ?"
9463,"hello im great , do you like football ?"
9464,i do like football . d you ?
9465,"i like it as well , what do you think about the titans and the week 14 of the season"
9466,i like the teams and have nk clue what happened in week 14 . i wonder what happened . . .
9467,i think they have a good team and they ended up winning 30 9 against jacksonville .
9468,so they were a good bet ! then again a lot of teams he success against jacksonville this year . bortles really held them back this year . they had a good d . . .
9469,"yeah jacksonville didnt have a good tea m , so what is your favorite team ?"
9470,im a bears fan . we did widely but not wel enough for my liking .
9471,"i am a patriots fan , and hopefully melt yea you can make it to the superbowl , its hard to make it there when there re 16 good teams for each division"
9472,yeah . i am assuming you will be watching on sunday ? ? ? ?
9473,"i wilco sure watch the game , i have a whole party set up lol , friends are coming so its going to be a nice game 5o watch , even if we lose"
9474,that 'll be fun . what 's on the menu ?
9475,"chicken wings , burgers and beer , lots of beer lo l , what are you doing for the game ? do you have nothing special set up ?"
9476,i will watch it at my house . my wife is not a huge fan but she watches this game with me . i will do jalapeno cornered and jambalay say ca n't wait !
9477,im counting the hours for sure lol i wonder how the hips the players have work or here that info goes to
9478,9 know my chips will be going into my belly . . . they don ' that a rule against women playing .
9479,"unit would be interesting to watch a woman play on sunday , it would be a bold decision from the coach though"
9480,i am not one the american public has the stomach to watch that . those guys are pretty big !
9481,"they are i guess stats why theory not a written rule yet , material with a game of strength ."
9482,good luck on sunday . nice chatting with you .
9483,"hi , do you follow football ? the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink !"
9484,"hi , yes i d . i wonder if that actually effects he visiting team or if they in it is funny ."
9485,"i guess they thought it was worth a shot . kind of feminine , but some omen play pretty tough ."
9486,"i am surprised that in the 60s , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
9487,"it wa a golden age of bowling , never to return . i guess they were the stars of the media at the time ."
9488,it may return ! crazier thigns have happened .
9489,"there 's probably a better chance that women will play in the nfl , which has no written rule against female players"
9490,i wonder who will be to first woman play . i will give her a lot of credit !
9491,"probably a kicker , maybe a punter . worth can be refs , probably coaches too ."
9492,they deserve to be !
9493,very true . they would get treated better than cheerleaders i hope .
9494,agreed . i ca annoy be ; level that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes o five gameplay .
9495,it seems so short but these are so many injuries . new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player .
9496,that is crazy ! i am surprised that is allowed to be massed .
9497,"they would be better off becoming engineers . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime , e earnings of an nfl player"
9498,i guess that is because they have longer careers .
9499,very true . fewer concussions . hat is the way to go . they could design chips that track players .
9500,it would be cool to record a players every move on the field .
9501,"true . anyway , i enjoyed chatting with you ! have a good day !"
9502,ou too !
9503,thanks !
9504,bye
9505,hello ! are you watching the super bow tonight ?
9506,i wish baker mayfield were playing in the game .
9507,"yeah , he souds like a decent player . i do n't know much about him overall , all though he seems like he 's an excellent player . 2016 is impressive !"
9508,"he won the heisman trophy in college , nad as selected high in the day ."
9509,"that 's amazing . i know most people did n't think he wa san obvious choice , but a ; aparently cleveland knew what they were doing ?"
9510,manly thought sam darnold or josh all were better choices .
9511,"why are qbs so important ? i mean i get that there did , but there 's so many other position on a team , why are they so important ?"
9512,the quarterback touches the football on almost every offensive play .
9513,"yeah , but still . for a game that averages only 11 minutes of live gameplay , you 'd think other positions would get a chance to buy in these pot light . it seems like teams live an eddie by their qb . . ."
9514,"perhaps , b ut the forward pass will remain essential ."
9515,"no , i get it . it 's the beginning of the play . i wonder why rugby didt take off over here come to think of it . . ."
9516,i think it is because football is brave enough to dot things like teh pink locker room in iowa .
9517,the pink locker room ? is that a breast cancer awareness thing ?
9518,"no , i think is was related to hte fact espn won an emmy for the yellow line . i may be wrong though ."
9519,"huh , i never heard o fit . my old and college team wee both horrible this year and i do n't have cable , so i gave up on going out to watch the game in october or so . the disappointment asu ' worth the money ."
9520,perhaps you can try following soccer r gaelic football .
9521,"i 've thought about oi it i think rugby would be more my style , even though i 'd probably like hockey more . although i 've got to say . . . i 'd root for any team that ahs a woman join ."
9522,do you think such a thing . evern legal within the rules of the game ?
9523,"as long as they meet the requirements for the league , why not ?"
9524,"i do n't know , but since engineers make more tha athletes ve a lifetime , perhaps they are the wiser ones ."
9525,both are a l ; ot of work .
9526,yes . designing the chips in shoulder pads and playing with them are both difficult !
9527,certainly ! one 's way safer rough .
9528,"hello , do you like football ?"
9529,hello ! i do ! how about you ?
9530,"i watch it sometimes , not a lot thoug ? did you know the nfl uses tracking chips on the players and football ?"
9531,i did n't know that ! ie it to track movements and very move on the field ?
9532,"yeah stats , location , spin , speed stuff like that"
9533,oh cool ! can you believe there is a rocket scientist that is a coach in hte nfl now ?
9534,thats pretty interesting .
9535,football is crazy around her though . 14 of teh world 's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams .
9536,"thats believable , college football is so serious , just like the nfl it generates a ton of money ."
9537,it even goes down to the nigh school level here a texas high school spent 60 million dollars on their stadium . i bet htey do n't even pay their teachers well either .
9538,"wow , well texas is a big football state , hey are obsessed , m but i guess theres nothing to do out there ."
9539,haha you 're right ! did you know there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
9540,"i did read that recently , fun fact ! the average football game is only 11 min ! !"
9541,and we sit there for 3 hours watching the whole game too just for those 11 minutes lol .
9542,"i kno wright , thats expensive . too many time outs , huddles and fouls lol"
9543,sec continue to love it though . maybe it 's because of the unknown during the game e .
9544,in hte 60 's top bowlers made almost 2 times more than football players .
9545,look at them now haha . i would have chosen bowling over football any day back then lol .
9546,"hell yesh , less injuries lol rowling is pretty fun ."
9547,oh for sure . i did n't know how much those big flags they waive across the field cost !
9548,"right , that is ridiculous that they cost 50k"
9549,"hopefully the money goes to a great cause ! anyways , i had a grea that with you , have a good night !"
9550,hi how ar you ? do you liek football ?
9551,no i do not like football . i also do not like the . three letter acronym skill be theyd heath of modern society .
9552,"yes tha will the is , that is true . we should be careful and cab ."
9553,would matt patricia know what can is ? h was a rocket scientist before becoming a coach .
9554,"cover your behind . jos death of modern society . , btw , matt is a genius . he knows every tha ."
9555,right . cover your behind . very well . is it important to people that live football to like the announcers . brett far would be as good ad any talking deaf .
9556,"i guess . does he have the personality to fill the booth thoug ? he might need to have af ew , just like madden ."
9557,interesting . have a few . i helps when watching a game to hae a fe . i could provide some play by play narrative on the picking of a few espn play analyst .
9558,"well , madden is known to drink while doing play by play . he is a colorful guy m , ut really need to restrain himself ."
9559,"peyton manning turned down espn and fox sports to be the face of the telecaster . perhaps madden , after having a few gets a little candy ?"
9560,"lol . yeah , john , boy , he gets lonely up in that booth . the man is a legend but he is past his prime . time for a chjgve up there ."
9561,do you find the idea of pay by play on searching for a play analyst for football kind of odd . entertainment has be coke entertainment . or something g .
9562,"yeah , every thing is so meta these days , hat met itself is getting old . we need likd megameta or something ."
9563,metameta . i like am . i wa worried you would pull a the out . michael stephan seems to have launched a successful broadcasting career . skipped the booth and right to morning tv .
9564,"morning . man , i could not do that . i would get tired of getting up early , um , who is michael stephan ?"
9565,new york giants defensive ed . 15 year career in the nfl . gap between his front teeth . i wonder if he will use his new found celebrity to push the nfl to study concussions .
9566,i hope so . that is terrible problem at all levels of the sport . cte should be looked into and people should know the risks of the sport .
9567,"the nfl is in a unique position to study the problem . they have drafts , tracking chips in shoulder pads . they have plenty of that subjects . if only the could avoid being found liable for injury ."
9568,"yes , i guess . once they know , then they all liable . still , if htey dont try , people will suspect the doest . anyway , great chat !"
9569,"rights on . track the ball velocity , speed and rotation and never learn a thing . good job nfl ."
9570,it is a business . the nl wants to keep the money coming .
9571,"17 eels of regular season , they have to grab cash fast ."
9572,the national football league is the one gf she major sports league in north america ay i consist of 32 team ?
9573,"they divide them into two divisions , so that they can play against each other to work heir way toward hte super bowl ."
9574,"the nfl season starts from september to late december . the nfl is started in 1920 as alpha , renaming itself in 1924 as nfl ."
9575,i didnt now that . as long as i have heard about pro football it has always been the nfl .
9576,the nfl has no written rule against the female player they want to met the league eligibility requirement .
9577,"im not sure many women woudl want o play , they can even treat cheerleaders we ; l . i cant imagine who they would treat a female player ."
9578,women they at to work hard to fit in the game . nfl uses racking chips in the players shoulder pads to records move int he field . this shows their digression to win the trophy .
9579,"it isnt hard to be 'aggressive for just 11 minutes , that is how much game only there is one the average game ."
9580,thy are earn mork revenue than other players . so only try want to lift the trophy .
9581,the only one who had been touching the trophy lately are the new england patriots . . . lol
9582,shih isp your favourite temp ?
9583,"my family is from miami , so i grew up a dolphins an . no trophies for me . lol"
9584,"in modern american football , the quarterback is cables as the leader of offense ."
9585,"the qb is definitely an important part of teh game . one of the most notable is recent times , tom brady didnt even yet a chance to play on his jv team !"
9586,dale smith is important player all time . he work hard to win each and every game .
9587,he had so many credits ink hs that he could afford to start working on a master degree before entering the draft .
9588,the quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive play and they make the forward passes .
9589,"yes , they do . did you know how the circular huddle came about ?"
9590,the university of iowas locker room for visiting football is always painted with pink . do you know ?
9591,"i hd heard that before , nice little intimidation tactic there ."
9592,sports is commonly football in some countries include the association football l .
9593,isnt that what they call soccer in the us ?
9594,its is soccer in us . so countries called by in the name of football .
9595,"i must go , nice chat . have a great day ."
9596,hello .
9597,"they , are you into football ?"
9598,"oh yea , you ?"
9599,yes l did you hear chase routllier is starting center with the redskins ?
9600,"no , i didn ' tc the washington redskins selected the wyoming product with a sixthround pick in the 2017 draft"
9601,"nice . i enjoy watching chase roller . he takes very good angles , and good technique . he 's a rookie , but he seems to be excellent in his position on the team ."
9602,"yes , and he 's just going to continue toga et better"
9603,"yeh , he has o get comfortable with the offense with him being a center . did you also hear chris thompson , runner back , is almost back to full health ?"
9604,that 's great to hear . the nfl has no written rule gains female players ; women wold in fat be allowed in they met the leagues eligibility requirements .
9605,i definitely agree with that statement . i know a lot of teams d nyt treat the cheerleaders of the football teams equally . the new orleans saints cheerleaders are not even allowed to eat in the same restaurant as their football players . so i bet teh female players would n't get treated fairly .
9606,"wow , i ca n't stand the saints anyways . nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the filed . they are so located inside footballs o track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
9607,"i believe that th end should n't allow technology like that , because it would make coach 's nit pick player 's every mores . they ness to let the players play naturally . thank you for talking with me today bout footbal ."
9608,"yes , i enjoyed it as well ."
9609,did you hear about the new helmet rule in te nfl ?
9610,"no , what 's that cruel ."
9611,players cannon lower their heads and make contact with opponents . i seen it on the agree game i was watching .
9612,"oh yes , that is correct . i have heard about hat one . the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220"
9613,i think the rule is hard for players when they are used to tackling in that manager . wow that score is so rich !
9614,"yes , they are . they continue to change rules ."
9615,did you know in won an emmy for the creation o they yellow line representing the first down line for american football games ? .
9616,"no , i did n't . very interesting . that . can yu hit done"
9617,"yes , thank you !"
9618,the . do you like football ?
9619,"well , i 've learned a lot about the function of a quarterback today ."
9620,the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink
9621,what an odd color to paint a locker room ! i wonde him it helped them core better !
9622,maybe . the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220
9623,that is an incredible amount of points to score in a football game ! unbelievable ! the other team must have been terrible !
9624,yes . former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
9625,that sound like a nearperfect record . what a talented football player . i wonder how much he was paid as a planet r .
9626,does't know . in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top footballs stars
9627,"it sounds like bowling was a much more lucrative career back then , t have football was . hard to imagine sa time when bowling paid more than football !"
9628,yes . espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the firs down line for american football game
9629,"that 's kind of funny winning an emmy for a yellow line that is superimposed on a t screen . usually emmys are given or best acting , or something like that ."
9630,true . well moore i 'the only left handed quarterback in the nfl
9631,"that 's interesting . i wonder if being lefthanded makes it harder or easier for other players . a deaf player by the name of paul d . hubbard created the circular huddle they use now in football . by huddling in ac ice , the other team was n't able to read his hand signals ."
9632,i remember hearing taht . there 's a guy who poes a commercial with one hand .
9633,what kin of a commercial do you mean ? what does he o with his hand ?
9634,i think for a car . he ' z in the nfl .
9635,"oh , so he does signal language , or uses football signals ? they should allow women to play football in the us . , do n't you think ?"
9636,no . they can if they want to . there 's no rule to stop them .
9637,"women can wear helmets just like the man football players . however , it would eb hard for women to block tackles from i men . the new orleans cheerleaders can eve eat in the same restaurant as players do . i guess that is to avoid fraternization ."
9638,"i newer knew that . plus , the cheerleaders have to watch their figures ."
9639,"i 'm sorry , i meant to say they can not eat in the same restaurant as football players . the cheerleaders are even required to leave the place is an nfl player arrives . thats ' really strange ! lol"
9640,yes . a lot of companies have strange policies . it 's sort of like the me too movement .
9641,"i 'm not sure how that is similar to the me too movement . can you explain the thou mega one ? the technology today is getting so precise , they even record every or the football players make wen they 're playing dont he field . the only uses tracking chips that are located in the shoulder pads , and inside the footballs , too ."
9642,"i newer knew that . i think it 's similar to me too , because everything now is sexual harassment . i 'm not saying where 's no sexual harassment , but everything is too pc ."
9643,"oh , i see what you mean . you mean they to n't want the football players and cheerleaders to date or socialize to avoid any harassment issues ."
9644,"yes , but to me that in silly . like wy would they wear such outfits ? if you find it demeaning , or however , do n't take that job ."
9645,thur cheerleaders ar singed to wear skinny outfits to entice male viewers . i 'm not sure if you 're connecting the outfits to the rule about not eating in the same restaurants or not .
9646,"yes , i am . i 'm saying everything is over sensitive now ."
9647,"i suppose you are right . here has teens o much publicity about harassment and it looks bad when nfl players are caught doing soemthing like rape , or assault to they need those chips on them all the time , not just on hte field !"
9648,lol maybe one day we will all get chips .
9649,"these chips can read so much information ! the ones the football players wear track their speed , their rotation and even how fast teh blah is going and where the ball is located on the field ."
9650,interesting . i have to go finish cooking my dinner r take core .
9651,nice talkin to you . have a good dinner .
9652,bye
9653,good morning to you !
9654,"good morning , do you like watching football by chance ?"
9655,i do ! i never miss a patriots game during the season . what about you ?
9656,"i am a fan of the patriots but i dont follow every game , you must love brady then ."
9657,"yea hes one of the best ! interesting guy in his personal life , but hes ' a heck of a quarterback"
9658,yeah he is a legend adjust like benjarvus green ellis do you remember him ? he 's a former rb that played in th pats .
9659,"yea i read he has a great claim to i name , he never fumbled the ball in his entire career !"
9660,"he never did , he is another legend indeed , i think he 's the only rb that can say that at least our of the good rbs in the history of hte league ."
9661,i agree . did you hear about the highest scoring football game of all time ?
9662,"no , what is the highest scoring game of all time i wondered ?"
9663,it was a whopping 2220 ! georgia tech dominated cumberland
9664,"that must had been painful to watch lo l , 2220 what was wrong with the losing team !"
9665,i dont know ! its a ; lost like they didnt even show up to the game !
9666,"i know right , or maybe they only had one player on the opposing team i have to google that ."
9667,that woul eb a funny one to watch . one man on the field against an entire opposing team
9668,"that woul e funny and also really unfair , no way one person could win alone , not even brady lol ."
9669,absolutely not haha . did you ear bout alex smith ? apparently he was pretty smart and took all sorts of ap classes in high school . he even began working on hs masters before getting drafted !
9670,i did hear about him he is a great qb but i didnt know he had a masters i guess eh takes advantage of time .
9671,yea and i guess he really was preparing a fallback plan in case the football career didnt pan out . i wonder what he 'll do when he retires
9672,"i bet he ha plenty o choices , he does hav epa backer ; lord degree and also a masters degree so that should help him ."
9673,"he of . speaking of degrees , i better go study ! nice chatting with you !"
9674,do you watch football ?
9675,i do . what do you think of the nfl using tracking chip snow in the shoulder pads to record data on the players ?
9676,i guess it makes it more accurate ut it 's crazy how fast technology is developing . espn also won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line .
9677,i love that yellow line . it makes it nice to see where they have to get to .
9678,leah it helps a lot . it 's amazing how much football has evolved . in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top footbal stars .
9679,wow . i wonder if any females ever tried to play back then since the nfl doesnt ' have a rule want does n't show them to play .
9680,"and the circular huddle was invented for football , most likely back then , by a deaf quarterback ."
9681,pretty neat i think i 've hear that before . i don ; t think he wanted the other team to steal his hand signals .
9682,yes you ar eight ll and the used to be really high scoring games in 1916 . doubt it would happen today where georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 to 0
9683,georgia tech must have ben reall good back then . either that or cumberland was super bad .
9684,haha i wish i coul see the footage . too ad it wass o long ago !
9685,talk about a one sided game . allan moore is the only left handed q bin the nfl .
9686,"i wonder why that is . i wonder if there is a disadvantage . speaking of disadvantages , tom brady 's high school was doin badly and the fused to start whim ! now h eis a four tiem super bowl champion ."
9687,"is n't that soemthing ? i think he was a 6th round pick too in the 2000 draft so every team , passed on him before the patriots highend him ."
9688,crazy ! good thing he did not give up . ut it is good to have a backup plan like dale smith who got his bachelor 's degree before being drafted into the nfl .
9689,that was pretty impressive . he got his degree in only 2 years !
9690,"yesh , that is awesome . what do you think about quitting football to go to full time competitive gaming ?"
9691,are you talking about baker mayfield ? that is the craziest thing i 've heard .
9692,"yeah , he says he can beat anyone at his university of on one ,"
9693,good call oj his part to stick with football . if anything he should have though about being an engineer since they make more over a lifetime than ana average if player .
9694,"yeah , maybe you are rift !"
9695,"hello , are you a football fan ?"
9696,i do watch the occasional game . i find it interesting that players ar more famous than teams . like eli manning of the giants .
9697,i watch a game every blue moon . did you know that average snl game only has 211 minutes of live gameplay ? crazy !
9698,"yes , there are a lot of rules , flags and time outs . its kind of like accounting . what do you think of kyle lauletta replacing manning ?"
9699,"i guess if manning is n't design hte job , it 's the to play the rookie . teams have to do that they need to get a win ."
9700,it does seem he is not doing the job . it must be at rough choice for a coach . the qb touches the ball almost every play . to loose a great pick manning would be tough .
9701,i am sure it must had but it might be time for them to move i . manning i 37 and i 'm sure it 's not ass easy as it once was .
9702,"i like the way the word football means different things depending on location . some people would think soccer , some would think rugby ."
9703,yeah so confusing sometimes . i ca n't believe she highest score in a regular football game was 2220 back in 1916 ; ga tech v . cumberland . yikes !
9704,"that game must have been something to some , for the winning side . did you know that a high school stadium in texas seats 18 , 000 people and cout 60 million ?"
9705,"wow , i 'd say that ' sa lot for a high school stadium . must be a hug school . wonder if they have any pink locker rooms like univ of iowa for their visiting football teams ."
9706,"football , its fun , games and pink locker rooms and serious as well . 14 of the 25 largest stadiums are college teams . i wonder if iowa is large and pink ."
9707,probably just trying to psych out the visitors . did you know that girls ca actually play in the nfl ? there seems to be no written rule against it as long as they meet eligibility requirements .
9708,"that sounds like a good thing , but is it really ? do we want to see a girl get hurt on the field ? the nfl uses chips in players ; ads to track movement ."
9709,yeah that does n't sound very appealing at all . would have to be a pretty tough gal for tha . best to do the cheerleading thing probably though i feel bad for the no saints cheerleaders who are forbidden from eating in the same restaurants as nfl players .
9710,"cheerleading is a sport in i itself . 32 football trams each have cheerleaders . but , they only wore 17 weeks unless the team makes the playoffs ."
9711,they would definitely be buster cheering for patriots . they mad playoffs a lot . in fact benjarvus green former patriot theyve once fumbled the ball in his nfl career .
9712,thats a neat thing tolt earn . nfl qb russell wilson is also a mlb players . the rangers traded him to the ny yankees . i wonder if he gets two checks .
9713,"too bad he did n't go for engineer as second job , they make more than nfl players nd mlb players ."
9714,i think it has to do with some players making a name and being worth a great deal . the average engineer has no name and makes a decent amount . rocket scientist matt patricia is a coach in th envy . i am sure eh makes more as the coach stan the rocket scientist .
9715,quite possibly ! hey nice chatting . have a great today .
9716,"he who is your favorite quarterback ? i like tom brady , but i can appreciate kellen moore , he 's hte only lefthanded quarterback in the nfl !"
9717,i am a fan of most offensive members . k prefer the quarterback leaders . tom is the man !
9718,i agree ! what do you think about alex smith ? d id you know he was actually a genius and almost got his master 's degree d ?
9719,"wow , that is impressive ! baker mayfield almost quit football to be a game . good thing he stayed in the sport !"
9720,"i agree i think eh 's got a better career playing football lol . what about the circular huddle , do you know how that started"
9721,i 'm pretty sure it was from a quarterback that was hard of hearing . ; is that right ;
9722,"ye you 're right , he was deaf and would use the huddle to block phish and signals actually ."
9723,"i would love to see women on the field . did you know the university of iowa locker room has been painted pink ? i guess pink iss tereotypically associated with women , so maybe that 's for any female players who might join the nfl ?"
9724,haha that 's a good point . i wonder why they painted it that cold by the way ? an scan yo believe the way that the saints treat their cheerleaders ? did you hear bout that
9725,it bit probably a good idea to keep the cheerleaders and players apart ford drama purposes . of the 32 teams in the league i think the saints are the only ones that do that .
9726,"i heard that other teams do that but i 'm not 100 percent are , what do you think about teams using tracking chips to heck the players on the field though ? that could be good for thats i think"
9727,i would love access to the data ! such interesting technology . or hate money since engineers make more than players do .
9728,"it is shocking , also shocking that the average nfl game only has about 10 or 11 minutes of ga , replay , that 's not too much time"
9729,pretty crazy that so much of the gaming is not active play . this year 's superbowl . was on the first sunday of february as it always i . pretty boring game of 11 minutes of play .
9730,yep i agree it was pretty boring . lso boring is watching bowling games lol . they used to be the highest pai athletes back in the 60s
9731,i love bowling ! but watching it is boring . i wonder why they are n't paid as well all of these years later .
9732,they indeed to invent some new stuff to put on tv when bowling us on . like the yellow line tha they use for football that espn invented
9733,who is your favorite afc team ? i ca n't wait or the superbowl next year whe nthe afc plays the andc .
9734,". actually do n't follow football that much . i do like the patriots though , are they ? the afc ?"
9735,i am not sure . but the patriots r and amazing team . they will go down in history .
9736,"yep i agree . i love their running back benjarvus greenellis , he 's never fumbled the ball before , he 's sp amazing"
9737,hi there ! do you watch football ? th nfl is made up of 32 teams .
9738,"yeah 32 teams 2 divisions , my favorite team is in the afc division , so yeah , i like to watch football , what about you ?"
9739,i love to watch football . did you know former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the football in his nfl career ?
9740,"never fumbled ? really ? wow , i knew the guy was good ut never fumbling 'the ball seems lke an impossible feat for a rb"
9741,"yes , pretty amazing . football is a interesting spit ? did you know that the nfl that no rules against female players as long as they can get the league 's eligibility requirements ?"
9742,"no didnt know about that , has a woman ever played in the nfl ?"
9743,i do not know . did you know that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live game play ?
9744,"i didnt now that either , i did know about the tracking chips players have in their shoulders , heard of those on enforce ?"
9745,"no , wht are they all about ?"
9746,"htey pull stats out of the game , there are also chips on the ball that determine the speed , rotation , and other interesting facts of the football"
9747,now that is cool ! hard to believe that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player .
9748,"seems like engineers do really good , they get . earn more money and without the rain damages or injuries tat football creates"
9749,taht 's what i was thinking . even thet op bowlers in the 1960 's mad ex as much as top football stars .
9750,"i guess football is a lot more popular now , i dont see pro bowlers making much money these days"
9751,"i agree . talking about this day and age , it ' hard to believe that saints cheerleaders are not allowed the eat at the same restaurants as the payers and if they are eating and a player comes in they have to go ."
9752,"taht is a really unfair rule , the saints should change that , its totals rude adn out of line"
9753,"yes , it ? s dated ! i am glad there is football though . k love the super bowl . it is usually held the first sunday in feb ."
9754,"i glad about that too , did you watch this years superbowl ?"
9755,"i sure do , did you ?"
9756,i also watched it in as rooting for th patriots nut thought it was a boring game
9757,well it wa stood talking with you . bye now .
9758,hi ! are you into sports ?
9759,"i am , i like the nfl , do you ?"
9760,"yes , i enjoy some footballs are and there , i just wisht here were somemfemale players . but i wouldnt go againt those though players , its intimidating ."
9761,did you know the average game is only 11 minutes long ?
9762,"yes , and its insane . sometimes i wish it was only 11 minutes . my husband can go a little not , hes a big fan"
9763,here are a lot of commercials . it is 're when you are there like .
9764,true ! i find it interesting how the nfl ca track footballs to monitor speed an rotation ! i think the players are tracked too .
9765,"yeah , that is pretty cool . i wonder what they do with all of that data ?"
9766,"maybe that 's how they see how fast player throw , so they can improve . u heard players have their shoulder pads clipped o track their move o nthe field ."
9767,"yeah , i heard that too . i 'm not sure what they do with the information through ."
9768,"im not sure , but it would be interesting to find out . but did you know that an engineer makes more in a lifetime than a football player ?"
9769,i can believe that . i think on average footbal players do n't last that long .
9770,at least they live theur dream da although football has never paid well in th 10 's top bowlers made twice as much as football stars
9771,"that is pretty funny , it reminds me of the bill murray movie where he is a bowler ."
9772,"there are alot of interesting facts surrounding football , like that super imposed yellow line we all love , the espn won an emmy one that !"
9773,"yeah , the line is great . i a to be honest , i wonder if they won one for the thing that follows a hockey puck ?"
9774,"50 , thats a good question . not sure i wonder why cheerleaders have strict rules , they cant be in the same restaurant as players r , least the saints have that rule"
9775,"interesting , the redskins have similar rules here . i know a few ex cheerleaders ."
9776,really ? how cool ! i guess not a perk of the job .
9777,"yeah , there was a player her e , chris cooler , who got in trouble for marrying one . well nice chatting with you !"
9778,"i figured it was to keep them focused on the prize . anyway , fun chatting with you too , they care !"
9779,brett favre was one of the greatest qb ever do you agree .
9780,packers qb ? for sure . loved vikingspackers rivalry ! heard esp recently turned down favre for nfl broadcasting got . they lost a lot of football knowhow ! what do you think ?
9781,"i didnt hear about that , but i think they they are missing out on a high rating ."
9782,"agree . they want to replace jon gruden on monday night football . he ' ; e back coaching the raiders . peyton manning turned down espn , too . another ratings loss ?"
9783,"could be , i don ' follow them much but it seems like a mistake , peyton manning is another hall of famer ."
9784,"right . favre had a 20 . career , a sb wen , there nfl mvp awards , after all ; who 's your fav nfl team ?"
9785,"mine the patriots , the one with the bigger comeback on superbowl history , yours ?"
9786,"i saw that gave against he falcons , was n't it ?"
9787,"9th was against the falcons , thought its the best game i have ever watched . do whats your favorite team ?"
9788,"have to admit that , of the 32 teams , i do n't have a favorite . do like individual players . admire tom brady . did you know when he was in jb , his team list every game and did n't even score a td , yet his coach never put brady , the backup qb , into a game ! little did that guy know . . ."
9789,"i didnt know that , i wonder why , his coach must had been terrible , do you also like alex smith , his another what qb ."
9790,"yes , heard he was so smart he entered college as a junior and got bachelor 's in just 2 years . when did he join nfl ?"
9791,u think it was in the year 2005 he was the first pick in the nfl draft .
9792,"must be good , as well as smart . what team does smith qb now ?"
9793,"i have no idea , i dont really follow him anymore baker mayfield is another great qb , he is also a skilled gamer ."
9794,heard the name . college qb . univ . of oklahoma ?
9795,"yeah that the one , he considered quiting football and phrasing a career in gaming"
9796,wow . thought football nfl paid better . but they say engineers lifetime earnings exceeds both nfl and mlb players . because injuries end careers ?
9797,"im guessing its because of that , engineers tend to have longer careers also so yeah , that makes sense ."
9798,did you know the 3 . nfl game has only 11 minutes of live game play ? guess they know : have embedded chips in players ' shoulder pads these days . do they really need to track every move w o cameras everywhere ?
9799,"only 11 minutes relaly ? that 's not much at all and that seems a bit invasive , i guess the players get used to that eventually , anyways its been great chatting with you today ."
9800,"chip no problem for my fav . player , rb saquon barkley of giants . makes you want to watch football all day great young athlete . catch him on 2018 nfl highlights ! thanks for great chat !"
9801,"i agree he i sa great athlete and player , one of the best rb out there , thanks for ther chat bye ."
9802,hello hows it going ? did you kno wthe nfl has no written rule against female players ; w omen would in fact b allowed if they met the league 's eligibility requirements . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay
9803,"yeah , in some ways the nfl treats women well , but in others , it treats them really poorly . the cheerleaders in particular . the saints cheerleaders even ave to leave a restaurant if the player walk i after theyve been eating ."
9804,"yeah i read that too pretty sad ! this one is really interesting : n fl use stacking chips embedded in players shoulder pads 04 record a players every tv on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
9805,"thats pretty crazy . i never watched much football , our school did n't have a team . i 'm more familiar with soccer , although they call that football in a lot of other countries ."
9806,ring . the junpero serra high school jv football team recorded a historically bad season in which the failed to win a game or even score a touchdown yet they never attempted to start their backup quarterback . that backup quarterback they refused to start is 4 time super bowl champion tom brady .
9807,"that sounds like my life . just imagine how much money those player makes now , in 1960 , top bowlers were actually gettin paid more ."
9808,lol wow bowling so have been really popular back then lol
9809,"lol i guess so . apparently heh highest score ever in a football game was georgia tech vs . , brand , 2220 in 1916 ."
9810,"geez thats horrible . lol alex smith took so many ap tests in high school taht he there university as a junior . the quarterback received his bachelor 's degree in two years , and began working gon a master 's degree , before becomign tbh first overall pic kin the 2005 nfl draft ."
9811,"i watched wa documentary not too long ago about the neurosurgeon that investigated traumatic brain injuries in if players , it was crazy ."
9812,"wow , thats probably sad to watch ."
9813,"it was sad . they are a ridiculous amount of money , but they can only work for a fe wears . and what can they do afterwards ?"
9814,well if they saved heir millions of dollars hopefully teh can travel the world and relax .
9815,"football , rugby , and soccer are all in the same family of sports . all involving kicking a ball towards a gal ."
9816,former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
9817,"i read that the circular huddle wasa adapted by a deaf player so thati he opposing tea , couldnt real hi hand signals ."
9818,thats pretty considerate of the nfl .
9819,there is only one left handed quarterback in the entire nfl .
9820,that seems odd . former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis gas never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
9821,lol one player considered quitting to play halo professionally . nfl form it not treat them that agreat .
9822,lol right ! its been good chattin with you .
9823,hello do you follow the nfl ?
9824,teh run too quickly . but i do watch them on tv . you ?
9825,i 'm a fan . out of the 32 teams in the nfl do you have a favorite team ? i 'm a browns fan myself .
9826,my condolences . i am a recovering bills fans myself . my biggest cheers are heard during the bye week .
9827,"nice ! i 'm not too far from bills territory . i live in extreme north east ohio and when we go to erie , pa to shop it turns into hills country . lol"
9828,"ave hello when you get neat he border of ny . i '' be wearing a perks . you know , the nfl has no written rule against omen in teh nfl ? that is what helps the bills under the cap . ."
9829,lol i 've been your way quite a few times . we always stop at that big rest stop on is in ny . i always look forward tos seeing the big indian status as well . ol
9830,"nice ! i have a friend in med school in erie . . , osteopathic medicine . that is what cheerleaders ar trained in . especially the ones n new orleans that are prohibited to single with nfl players over dinner . singing ish hazardous to ones health ."
9831,is n't that th oddest rule ? i wonder why they came up with it ? did you know that and average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
9832,"in bills country we would celebrate if there was at least on minute of ' live gameplay ' you know , the average lifetime eanrints of an engineer is more than that of a nfl player ? that is why the current hr trend t to give the players the job position of ' football engineer '"
9833,lol in teh 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top fooball stars of the day . i 'm sure that 's way differnt now .
9834,"bowlers are making a comeback . they are seeing more and more concussions these days ! soon they will be putting tracking chips in their bowing balls to plot the velocity , rotation , ba ; l speed , and location . . . for hose that did not watch the first time ."
9835,lol that 's great ! do you kno waht the highest scoring football game ever was ?
9836,2220 . . . that must have even a brutal game .
9837,talk abou ta blowout ! ouch . lol the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room completely pink . wonder why they did that ?
9838,"a jz calming influence on the players , i am sure the visiting tema is always grateful for their considerate behavior ! like i am so thankful to espn for that superimoposable yellow line they pu to the field , . it talks me down considerably !"
9839,lol yes me too . especially when the team i 'm rooting for crosses that yellow line !
9840,"gives you a burst of endorphins ! that 's why i am books on the game . teh whole time the teams are in the huddle i 'm saying , ' who invented the huddle , and why are they spending so much time in there ? i need my next fix !"
9841,lol that was pretty neat that the huddle was created by a deaf qb so the other team could n't steal his hands signals . it 's been fun chatting with you !
9842,same here ! and perhaps ; s soon we will seem ore than just one lefthanded qb . until then . ? . . may all your balls bounce age right way !
9843,hahaha that 's great ! have a great night !
9844,you a sports fan ? i always wanted to be a quarterback ! the leader of the offense ! glorious job !
9845,i am ot a footbal an thought usually watch hte scope bowl whichisheld the first sunday in february ?
9846,oh nice . yeah do ! i did an exciting single elimination tournament indeed .
9847,and seeing the nfc and afc compete against each other is nest ?
9848,"yeah agreed . i think the nfl , 17 weeks regular season should be shortened . it 's tool of and lots of injuries occur ."
9849,i guess joe franco was important or the ravens and was sitting out injured .
9850,yeah but it sounds like lamar jayson was doing well in his place .
9851,franco i sa former super bowl mvp but has n't done as well in recent times .
9852,yeah i think he still has good potential though . i have faith in him as a qb . qb 's sometimes do n't do so well . just ask tom brady who id n't even start in high school on his jv team !
9853,"wow , interesting ! speaking of quarterbacks , i wonder why there is only one left handed quarterback it the nfl ."
9854,yeah that is a good question . . . not sure . did you know the circular huddle was invented so a deaf quarterback could give secret hand signals ?
9855,i did ot know that . interesting . so russel wilson is a quarterback wh used to play for the mlb . they still have him under contract even enough he has not played in a regular season game since 2011 . e eas even traded in 2018 to the yankees from the rangers .
9856,haha wow so odd . why does n't he just cancel it ? gamer mayfield was once a very goo halo 3 player and it almost took over his life lil !
9857,"i am not sure i really understand the full story . brad johnson is another interesting one , only quarterback to have grown a touchdown pass to himself ."
9858,that is a great accomplishment . what team was tha for ? alex smith was a very smart high school student and he was drafted first overall in 2005 .
9859,"i 'm not sure what team . speaking of high school , the football stadium in allen , tx is extravagant . it cost 60 million to build ."
9860,holy flow nat is expensive . lot of guacmaole . i wonder how big the serra high school stadium is ? that is weird tom brady played .
9861,"it seats 18 , 000 ! wonder i they fill that up ."
9862,holy cats . that is really something . i wish that new orleans saints allowed their players to interact with players . such a weird rule . well it was so lovely talking with you today .
9863,seems like the nfl is filled with kind rules . nice talking to you today !
9864,bye !
9865,do you like football ?
9866,"yea , my favorite team is the giants but i follow lo 325 nfl teams to a degree"
9867,i 'm not too into football . maybe because there are only abot 11 minutes of live gameplay per game .
9868,for 11 minutes of live gameplay the nfl sure has a lot of injuries
9869,"you the right ! it 's amazing how much football has developed in popularity . in the 60s , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
9870,"yea , football is so popular espn won an emmy for creating the yellow first down line"
9871,and there are even tracking chips in footballs and shoulder pads
9872,"i wonder what the nfl does with all the dat from these embedded chips , hopefully they use i for player safety"
9873,"yeah , hope so . there is so much competition in football to become a football player . maybe more people should aim to be engineers instead . over a lifetime their average earnings are higher ."
9874,"yea or they could stay harder in school like alex smith did , he started col ; huge as a junior"
9875,yeah i liek that he had a backup plan . benajrvus greenellis seems like eh has always been surgeon himself . he has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
9876,that is pretty impressive if i wonder if there will be any female players in the nfl since thee is no rule banning tiem
9877,"yeah , i have heard there is an up and comin woman kicker . but in other ways th email seems sexist , like how saints cheerleaders must leave an esablishumrnt even if they are already eating , if sapiens players come in ."
9878,"yea that is a amassed up rule , i wonder what would happen if the saints had female ; players on their team"
9879,"yeah , hopefully this changes ."
9880,did you know that back mayfield considered quitting football to professionally clay video games ?
9881,that seems like of crazy but professional amazing cain be lucrative sw sell .
9882,yea and less injuries playing halo 3 than professional football
9883,right ? it 's surprising that tom brady kept believing in himself and not giving up and bring to a different profession . when he was in high school his team refused tos start him even though they had a terrible season .
9884,"yea , i disagree with him brady 's jv coach 's decision to not switch qbs after failing to score a touchdown all season"
9885,yeah and now he is s four time super bowl champion . i 'd be embarrased if i were his hs coach !
9886,nick role is a good players and the eagles are lucky to have him
9887,"8 think so too , but they under utilize him in the regular season and that puts roe much o wentz ."
9888,"they should start using him more , he has had a lot of brilliant moment dont he league , they should exploit that"
9889,"absolutely . i understand that his track record when he was their starter was shaky , he has a 64 percent eating , but if they rotated him and wentz he would get more chances to play and increase his skill level ,"
9890,"i guess he let down a lot of fans , w benz was the second overall pike in t he 2016 draft right ?"
9891,he was 2nd in that draft . but they could still be favorites they just have to prepare foles for atlanta .
9892,"seems like do you like the nfl a lot , any favorite teams ?"
9893,i am a pretty big football fan in general . i am a pittsburgh steelers fan . ben roethlisberger has the most wins of any quarterback . . . in cleveland !
9894,"i am a fan of the patriots , steelers have a rich history , how are they doing lately ?"
9895,thai season could have been better . . were playing relaly well end at the top of the division but started losing to teams we should have easily beat . patriots ? have you ever been to a game ?
9896,"no , never , cant afford tickets so maybe one day , seems like a bit of a shame hen there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay"
9897,"i know they are really expensive , nut i hear it is a nice stadium . not big though . no nfl stadiums far really that large whuch is odd ."
9898,"have you been to a steelers game before ? are yeah stadiums are really big , the cost a lot too"
9899,"i have not . i live across the state so it would b lean expensive weekend . i do go to penn stare games though . ironically , htey have the 2nd largest stadium in the country and their tablets are far less expensive than the nfl ."
9900,"i like college football , its a good thing you can et them for a good price ."
9901,"it makes me happy to be able to go to games . there is a big difference between live and watching on tv . i also went to the school with i believe the ends larges thigh school stadium in the country , after teh allen , texas stadium ."
9902,"it is , games are more exiting , i am glad football exists , i wish i could afford to go to the super bowl maybe one day i cna and maybe the pats will be playing tha today ,"
9903,well you hav that a lot of luck with them going these last few years ! i hope to go to the super bowl some too . until then i guess i will stick to college games and try to get to pittsburgh !
9904,maybe they will play the super bowl against each other and we will be on opposing sides ! if thats the base ma the best team in with no hard feelings
9905,"that cain ' happen , the are in the same league . the most we can see that play each other is during the regular season nd in playoffs . and yes , no hard feelings ! hey ar two of the best franchises in the sport !"
9906,"oh i see , well in regular season then either way i hop you have a good night , bar"
9907,hello !
9908,hey how are you do you like nfl quarterbacks
9909,i do likd nfl quarterbacks !
9910,me too i like kellan moore have you heard of him ?
9911,"i have heard of him , is he a quarterback ?"
9912,"hd is and he is the only left handed quarterback , i think it gives him an advantage"
9913,"oh , wow . definitely interesing ! i find it funny that pro bowlers used to make twice he pay as football stars !"
9914,"taht is funny , also weird hat there are only 2 black quarterbacks that won the superbowl overall"
9915,"wow , that is interesting ! have you ever heard of al j8chaels ?"
9916,i have did n't he like a bunch of weight recently ?
9917,"i am not sure , k but he is well known for his on air gambling references between football teams"
9918,"oh i did n't know that , well do you like snoop dogg t all ."
9919,"i do ike snoop , did't he write a fight song for his sons hs football tea . . . ."
9920,"ya he did , i like his music , did you know the top paid employees of the dod are three footbal coaches , seems like a waste of money"
9921,"wow , i agree ! so something surprising i read is that in a football game . . . there 's actually only 1 minutes of live play . . ."
9922,"ya that is surprising , did you hear a football stadium in texas cost 60 mil , nc that it was for a highschool ? !"
9923,seriously ! that 's strange ! have you heard of alex smith ?
9924,"i think so , hes like a genius right ? kinda like the guy who created the nfl 's tracking chips"
9925,"yeah , he is smart and was the 1st overall pic kin the 05 nfl draft . . . . . good thing he took the football path !"
9926,"ya i agree ! but ya the tracking chips can wrack the speed and rotation of the ball , kind of crazy ! i bet they get som cool stats"
9927,i bet they do too ! great invention ! too bad they didn ' g have that technology back in 1916 whe that football game was played where georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 to 0 !
9928,"haha that could have turned the tide ! we 've com . long way since then though , but still a huge american flag costs 50 , 000 now that i kinsmen"
9929,"hi , do you like football ?"
9930,i do n't do like football . . . i go to college games and i 'll watch it when my husband is watching . do you like football ?
9931,"that 's good . yes , i love football . did you knw iowa painted their opposing team lower room pink ?"
9932,i have heard that . . . it 's funny ! i guess it was a power play for them ? do you know that the highest scoring game ever was 2220 ?
9933,"wow , that 's a very high scoring game . it you know hat teams were it that game ?"
9934,"yeah , it was georgia tech to cumberland , back in 1916 . that was probably the most bring game to ever watch !"
9935,that would have been terrible to be on cumberland 's team . how depressing .
9936,depressing and embarrassing !
9937,for sure . the 1996 's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars .
9938,"wow , that 's something ! i wonder what those stats are now . . . football stars probably fake ex what top bowlers make ! !"
9939,i wonder as well . greenellis who is a running back never fumbled his entire nfl career .
9940,witht stats like that i hope he was the highest payed running back ! did you realize emmy 's could be given to sports channels ?
9941,wow i had no idea . which sports channel received an emmy ?
9942,espn was an emmy for superimposing th yellow first down line onto the games !
9943,very cool . do you watch espn ?
9944,"i do n't , we only have streaming services . do you watch espn ?"
9945,i do n't watch it too often . do you like the nfl ?
9946,"i do n't have a favorite team , but my husband likes the cowboys . did you know that women could play in the nfl ? they 'd have to meet the league ' x eligibility requirements . . . but they could do it !"
9947,i bet they coul to it too . i could see them being a kicker or something like what .
9948,"get , maybe ! i wonder what the league requirements are ; what i think but every time i watch an nfl game is that there is an average of only 11 minutes of actual gameplay . i just think about all taht time that theyve doing otter stuff . . ."
9949,"i havent earth of the league requirements . i cant believe it 's only 11 minutes of actual gameplay . well , it was really good chatting with you . take care !"
9950,hi ! are you a football fan ?
9951,"i am , what about you ?"
9952,"yes , i am . what do you kno about lamar jackson of the raven ?"
9953,"i do n't know much , even though baltimore is not too far ."
9954,"well , jackson is a former heisman trophy winnings qb from louisville , who the ravens traded opt o take in the first round of the draft ."
9955,"interesting , did he set any records while in school ?"
9956,"he sure did . only player in be history to rush foray t least 1500 cds and pass for at least 300 bus in a season , and he did that twice !"
9957,interesing . did you know that espn won an emmy for that yellow is down marker ?
9958,"yeah , , where would we be without it ! it is almost as important to football these days as the huddle , that ohsofamiliar circling up of players around the qb to hide signal calling ."
9959,did you know that in 60s bowlers made more than football stars ?
9960,where dad bowlers go wrong ? apparently the popularity od football has exceeded bowing . i wonder if some other game will pas by football as the most popular soon ? perhaps gaming ? some pretty high profile college football players have considered not going pro in lieu of starting a career in gaming !
9961,"i think it just got old . if 9 were a college player and could go pro , i would yo pro . yiu are only young once ."
9962,"yeah , but football makes you grow old more quickly khan other games . . . if you are on the losing end of a lopsided loss , lilke the historic 2220 starring georgia tech gaved cumberland , you can grow old quickly ? . ."
9963,"that ' steve , even though these s only 11 minutes of game play . pretty crazy , huh ?"
9964,you can hear your neck ska thousand ties over within that the . and the nfl will have the event recorded via tracking chips in your equipment so that they can tell how quickly the train that hit you was going . . .
9965,"i thik they also put chip in the football a well , but i 'm not entirely sure what for . jay ideas ?"
9966,"to monitor speed , rotation , velocity , and location i heck , they even monitor the location of cheerleaders in new orleans , there they forbid them from doing in the same restaurant as any player . i wonder where they put the chips . . . . the pod moms ?"
9967,interesting . i think a lot of teams have that rule . did you know that there is now written rule against female players ?
9968,"yeah , but there are minimum eligibility requirements they still need to be met , ethic eliminate most men . . . so , i wonder what percentage of the women qualify ?"
9969,i think al they have to do is be good enough to pals to i honest .
9970,"yeah , but good enough to play in the national football league is still a pretty high bar . i hope a lady does break hat glass ceiling some day , a nd i also hope she keys all of our teeth !"
9971,that it is . nice chatting with you .
9972,"hey thee , do you follow the nfl ?"
9973,"i try to , wish the sue bowl would have been better his year , was just boring to me ."
9974,yeah well eh not think about it the game only lasts 11 minutes
9975,that is so unbelievable to me . apparently the nfl has had only one left handed quarterback . do you know who it is ?
9976,is thaat patriots greenellis ?
9977,no that 's for patriot rb benjarvus he never dumb ; ed the ball in his career .
9978,oh ok . was it kellan moore ?
9979,"yeah that 's him , hard to believe that the nfl never produced another lefty l"
9980,yesh exactly there are o many players in ther see did you know nfl is using chips o the player 's padding ?
9981,for what ? the are taking technology to far .
9982,i think they record hits and theirs running to maybe work on better helmets and stuff
9983,just another way to spend money . i you know that i nthe 60 's top bowler made more than top nfl players .
9984,tat is day . good thing they make more now to make a decent living
9985,speaking of football the iowa state universities visiting locker rooms are painted pink .
9986,i wonder if here is a reason for that . did you know espn won lane emmy ?
9987,"espn , yeah did n't it have something to do with first downs ?"
9988,i think it was because the creation od the virtual superior ; opposed yellow line
9989,o yeah that 's right made things easier if you were watching from home . 2200 was the highest scoring game in college football .
9990,what a win and a loss for the other team too
9991,"no that was the finals core , i believe it was in 1916 . do you now the teams ?"
9992,what a difference . nice hastings with you
9993,the raiders are having same terrible luck .
9994,"yeah ! do you agree that khalil mack is the raiders ' best player ? id you watch football , that is ."
9995,"yes i agree , i hope he stays healthy ."
9996,what happened to him ?
9997,he jury his ankle back in november after the raiders traded him to the oscars . i think they should of paid him what he was asking for .
9998,"oh yeah that 's right ! i think so too , his playing style an speed makes his 100 million paycheck justified ."
9999,"yes , i do not see the raiders gettin better any tim soon ."
10000,"yeah , true that ! i har no idea that tracking chips were used by hte nfl and embedded in shoulder pads o record every move on the field !"
10001,"thats very interesting , i know wthe wore microphones but 8 did it know about that . did you know that arrange nl game only has 11 minutes of live play ?"
10002,that 's it ? ! then why are these games taking up my entire afternoon and evening !
10003,"commercials i would imagine , it is a business ."
10004,"oh , yeah ! there 's only ne lefthanded quarterback in the nfl ! i wonder it defensive plays accommodate that fact ."
10005,i am sure they have special plays for him . woman are allowed to play if they were to make it physically !
10006,oh wow ! has any woman ever played in the nfl ?
10007,i do not believe so but i do not new orleans saints cheerleaders can not dine at the same restaurant as players !
10008,do you know why that is ?
10009,i do not i would imagine theyd o not want them interacting on a personal level .
10010,i ca n't recall any cheerleaders who have ended up dating a football player on the same team . he giant flags at footballs stadiums weigh over 1000 pounds !
10011,"taht is heavy , i would imagine dating the cheerleaders happens a lot . it is probably jet frowned upon ."
10012,the atmosphere is susceptible to that since htey travel together and are in the same enviroment a lot .
10013,"yes , great chatting wish you i must run ."
10014,great chatting with you !
10015,have a good day .
10016,"hi , what do you think about this nhl rule ?"
10017,do you mean the nfl rule ?
10018,"yes of course , i think that the committee of this organization is biker at very powerful people"
10019,"they do have a lot of influence , i agree ."
10020,if in reality they control the rules of hte games and other people we can only observe and express their opinion
10021,it does n't sound like that big of a rule change to me
10022,"soccer has hard pushes , it is not a physical game nor is it for the weak of thee heard . i think this statement is very true"
10023,i do n't think hard punched are allowed in soccer
10024,"of course the do it , for you i have practiced it and it is very are , you have played them ever"
10025,"well it should be called s a foul in soccer . if a ref saw yiu doing a hard punch to an opponent t , you would e sent off ."
10026,"yes , the are faults that the referee doe knot see clearly"
10027,i think that some people who watch nfl do n't want too many changes .
10028,"if so , others will cage if they want innovation . he the you think of the university of iowa that give uniforms to visiting team ?"
10029,"i did not know about that , why do they do it ?"
10030,"i meant to say tha they painted the uniforms of the pink opponents , that was in the head of the 60s"
10031,i do n't think that is sportsmanlike !
10032,"if i think it goes against the morale of athletes , thank god those times will change"
10033,yes it would be humiliating . i do n't thin anyone would stand fo i today .
10034,"sure . you think ? paul hubbard , a field marshal who wwf deaf"
10035,that is impressive . maybe herd too many guns going off ?
10036,i do not think that for that reason i suffer from that condition . bu what is important is that in the nfl allow to play this type of people
10037,i do n't think it is a problem of a player is deaf .
10038,thanks for sharing your comments with me
10039,thank you also !
10040,are you interested bout football and the nfl ?
10041,ye si am ! are you ?
10042,"i 'm not too big a tuna , but i have decent knowledge around it ."
10043,"same i 'm not too big of a fan , yet i 'm highly interested . such as , how is it okay to have the name redskins ? that 's terribly racist . i thought we were ' advancing as a species ! '"
10044,"well of the 32 teams , its only 1 team that has a radio name . although that still is n't okay , i believe they will change it if asked to ."
10045,"i sure hope so ! so , i heard that the only left handed quarterback in the nfl is kellan moore . i wonder why there 's so few left handed people in new ."
10046,"well , there are also no women in the nfl , even though they do n't have a rule against it ."
10047,"really ? that 's extremely intriguing ! i do know that the new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden to eat in a restaurant as any nfl player . if they are already eating and any nfl player comes in , the cheerleaders have to get up and leave !"
10048,"there are lots of interesting facts that go on behind the scenes , like the fact they use tracking chips on players and the footballs ."
10049,"oh yeah ! to track velocity , rotation , speed , etc . that 's pretty smart of them !"
10050,"they also tracked h players movements and stuff , maybe at 's where they get all the this from ."
10051,oh yeah . i 'm terrible at math so i think it 's a good thing they have something like that in place . i 'd imagine it would be impossible to break otherwise !
10052,"another weird fact is that in 1960 , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
10053,"interesting ! i ca imagine that 's not the case , these days ! homer patriot 's running back benjarvus greenellis has never tumbled the football in his entire nfl career !"
10054,i wonder how ? that sounds good when compared to the fact that people think alex smith ca n't carr the redskins .
10055,yeah its quite a record to hold for benjarvus ! i just found out there is a such thing as gaelic football . how neat !
10056,"there sure a blood of different kinds of football . rugby , soccer , australian football are some of them ."
10057,"yeah , it gets a litle bit confusing , considering i calls kicker , soccer ! the highest score ever in a football game was in 1916 , when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 !"
10058,"that 's very interesting , sounds like cumberland suffered a huge loss . anyways , it was nice talking to you !"
10059,yeh ! huge loss ! it was very nice talking to you as well ! have a nice day and goodbye !
10060,goodbye !
10061,hi there how are you ? do you like the nationals football league ?
10062,"hi ! i am not a huge fan , especially with the ways some of the teams treat their cheerleaders . like the saint , the cheerleaders are not permitted to eat at hte same restaurant as the players , and have to get up and leave if a player comes in ."
10063,"i do n't like that rule . it seems very outdated and stupid personally , i think that the cheerleaders should sue"
10064,"they probably have some sort of weird do . i 'm waiting for a woman to be drafted , maybe then things will change ."
10065,yes i think we 'll see that in our lifetime . i think that a woman would make a good kicker o something line that
10066,"i do too , especially since so many girls play soccer . it 's so weird to thin that other countries call soccer football ' ."
10067,"i agree with you . kind of crazy , the average nfl one only has about 11 minutes of gameplay that seems really low to me"
10068,"that does seem low . football is weird though , i still can not believe espn won an emmy for creating those superimposed yellow lines ."
10069,no but that s a great invention ! also crazy that the nl develop those tracking ships that they shoulder phds . have you heard about those ?
10070,"i have , some of the high schools are starting to use those . i think it 's funny that the u of iowa 's visiting locker room is painted pink . my son would vet dressed in the hall ."
10071,i think that would actually make em play better personally . did you know back in the 60s that football stars made about half waht the top bowlers mad
10072,"that is insane . kinda like that highschool coach who refused to put yom brady in , even though they ad n't won a game all season , do made a touchdown ."
10073,i bet that coaches kicking himself right now . i like th patriots . i also like the one running back was never fumble the football in his entire career
10074,"i bet be is too . i 'm thankful for the coach who would n't let baker mayfield quit , to become a pro gamer . that 's crazy too ."
10075,haha yeah he made the right decision . i was also really god at halo 3 haha . i would have liked to play him
10076,"i 'm okay on hat , i 'm a fallout fan . i thought ll nfl players were millionaires . it 's weird that an engineer earns more retain they do ."
10077,oh i like fallout a lot too . that is crazy witht he pay as well . do you know how the football huddle was started ?
10078,was n't it due to a player being deaf ?
10079,yes he was deaf . he us 'the huddle to cover up his hand sign so that the other read could n't ses it
10080,that was smart of hi m i finally saw colin kaepernick 's nike d . if as interesting .
10081,i have not see that . i wish i could have seen the highest scoring football game never . i guess that it was 222 to 0 haha
10082,"hello , do you like football ?"
10083,not really . i watch it because my kids do . i was not impressed that espn won an emmy for those superimposed lines .
10084,"oh really , i know my family loves football and goes to the games . i didnt realize thee is only 11 minutes of live game play . but it makes sense ."
10085,i think its hilarious that the top bowlers in the 60 's made more than football players .
10086,"i know , right ! thinking the visiting teams do n't like the pink locker rooms at the university of iowa ."
10087,"that is just dumb , lol . is it true that the highest score ever was 2220 ? makes you wonder why the coaches did n't stop the game ."
10088,i was thinking teh same . why sit there that long never getting ahead . but that was 1916 .
10089,was that georgia tech ?
10090,"yeah , they need to change that rule that the cheerleaders the to leaves the restaurant if a in player comes in ."
10091,"i adfree wb maker mayfield al , just did n't become a brown 's player . he wanted to become a competitive player ."
10092,"really , they must free there 's too much togetherness in the same restaurant tc lol"
10093,"i think it ' archaic and insulting . especially since try have to get up and leave , even if they have n't finished their meal ."
10094,omg ! yes . . . . at least have a plan before you go to the restaurant to prevent it .
10095,alex smith entered college as a junior . that 's awesome he was able to take so many ap tests in high school .
10096,"agree , he 's smart too ! did n't know a man quarterback created the circular huddle . hose hand signals ."
10097,"that is interesting . what do you think of the tracking chips in the balls ? seriously , those should have been used on ' deflate the ' ."
10098,you 're right ! and the shoulder pads . great for tracking . i thought there was more than just one left handed quarterback .
10099,"i would n't know . i only follow baker mayfield , as i too am good at halo 3"
10100,"lol , really ! yeah , understand thagt ! have a nic night ! good chat ! !"
10101,"thanks , you too"
10102,enjoy playing halo ! !
10103,"hey there , do you like then fl ?"
10104,"hey , i like and pay some attention . how abou you ? do you watch nfl ?"
10105,yeah from time to time mainly superbowl . i mean it is only 1 minute of actual game
10106,it 's very surprising about 11 minutes . have you ever been on stadium ?
10107,no i just watch it from the tv . ho about you ?
10108,"i also just hatch . did you know that the nfl has no any written restrictions against female player s , but they have to meet some requirements . i 'm wondering what kind of requirements it could b"
10109,i think as long as they can paws the test lilke make players do they can play . i am not sure though
10110,ia lso know at nfl player makes less thaat lane engineer if we checks lifelong time . it 's something i also did n't know .
10111,yeah you think they get paid a lot ut they do not really
10112,"it 's just surprising , because there lot of money in this industry . really relaly a lot"
10113,yea ? did you know about that rule of cheerleaders for the saints lost being able to eat in the same restaurant as the players ?
10114,"it sounds really weird . what if they already here with friends , family , etc ? just stupid rule . it does n't make sense for me ."
10115,me either so strange . did you know university of iowa locker room os pink ?
10116,"no , i did n't know . i did n't know that the highest score in history . football was 2220 , but long tiem a . did you know that ?"
10117,no that must have bad a really terrible loss . who was playing ?
10118,"georgia tech against number , and . georgia won"
10119,wow good for them what a win . do you have a favorite player position in the nfl ?
10120,not really . i guess every position has some interesting aspects . bt i know a lot of people like quarterback
10121,yeah that is for sure . do you know alex smith ?
10122,"yes , i know something , but not a lot . do you know something intereting about him ?"
10123,he graduated in two years from college . it was nice chatting with you
10124,hello ! are you getting as excited for the nfl playoffs as i am ?
10125,"i was , who are you a fan of ?"
10126,"i know that a lot of people do n't like them , but probably the new england patriots . speaking of the pats , tom brady was n't even put in a qb on his jv team in hs that lost all of their games !"
10127,"that is kinda crazy , a lot smith entered college as a junior and got his bachelors in 2 years , made his college qb career short ."
10128,"tha is pretty amazing . i think hes till had some eligibility , but to think o graduating in two years ! or you1 old be like razor mayfield who almost became a fulltime gamer !"
10129,makes you think some people are just good at everything . did you know that there was once a deaf quarterback ?
10130,"there was a deaf defensive , lineman at nebraska , but did n't know about a quarterback . how did h communicated with his teammates ?"
10131,"he used hand signals , t hat is where the huddle originated , to prevent others from seeing his signals ."
10132,"that . really interesting . as the leader of the team , i bet that really helped meet everyone i sync !"
10133,"rights ! interesting fact , there has only been one left handed qb in the nfl , kwlaln moore . i wonder why that is ."
10134,"i think he is the only one right now . i am pretty sure theres were others , but maybe there just are n't a lot of great ones coming out of college ?"
10135,"that woul make more sense . speaking of college football , here in iowa we have the visiting teams locker room painted pink ."
10136,i am actually in nebraska o i knew about our rivals ' pink locker room . it 's amazing what teams will duet og et an edge .
10137,"is n't it . hey you mentioned liking the patriots , i ca n't believe that greenellis has niger fumbled the ball in his entire career , that i amazing ."
10138,it 's pretty much unheard of . to think if it was the 1960s these players would be making elses than top bowlers .
10139,bowlers make nothing compared to nfl players . but their careers are usually so short and they certainly make the teams money .
10140,"they really invest in there players , but you have correct . the average earning of an engineer love his life is more than an nfl player ."
10141,really weird to think of it that way . i think antonio brown may have shortened his career a lot after this weekend .
10142,"he 's an elite players , but obviously has some real issues with tomlin nad the steelers ."
10143,"you know your football . i hope that he finds a home where he is comfortable . steelers spare out now anyhow , guess i 'll watch hockey ."
10144,hockey is fun too adn i usually wish i watched it more . have a good one !
10145,do you pay attention to the nfl playoffs at all ?
10146,yes i do .
10147,"which of the teams were you rooting for this year ? i watched a few of the games , and there is a lot of potential in a lot of the team that makes me want to keep my eye on for he next season"
10148,i thought the rams were a good contender and halo the kansas city chiefs . i think it all boils down to wat quarterback has a good passed rating .
10149,true ! it definitely would have been interesting had it been the chief against the last . the qb is key in those games though
10150,i know what you mean . take agnew luck for example . he 's the quarterback for the colts adn e 's the 10th most valuable passer of the year .
10151,i wonder if te fact stat kellan moore is the only hefty nfl qb affects how the team has been going the past few years
10152,"would be , then again perhaps not . there has been a deaf quarterback back in the day . he 's the whole reason the teams get into huddles ."
10153,i wonder how well that team did overall . he seems like th kind of guy who could adjust wells o the circumstances around him
10154,yes he does n't he team with him . they figured out that by huddling they could keep opponents from heading his hand signals .
10155,"sow fooball players are stars like that . for instance , alex smith was working on his master 's degree by the time he was in the nfl draft because he started college as a junior"
10156,he started college as a junior ? i guess he was really working in high school not just on football but on education too .
10157,"i guess if you take allot he ap classes while in high school , college can be shortened by two years . hem so have been a good player too to be the first overall pick in 2005"
10158,"speaking of good players , have you heard of baker mayfield ? not only is he a great quarterback but also a great game . he thought about going professional on video game competitions ."
10159,"football probably pays more though , and gaming is a good plan b if the nfl route does't work out"
10160,that 's true . football pays good now but in the 1960s bowlers made more than players .
10161,"do professional bowlers still make money nowadays ? it seems that espn ahs changed the popularity of footbal ; , especially witht hat first down line they invented that aide get easier to viewers to keep track of the game"
10162,i definitely does . i think it adds to the excitement too because you snow just how far they ave to go to get their firsts own .
10163,it was a good enough invention to win an emmy . sometimes it 's the simple things that make a difference
10164,thats true lol ! do you watch any college football ? they had hte highest scoring game ever .
10165,"i do n't , but a n't it back then georgia tech played cumberland in 1916 ?"
10166,"it was , georgia tech scored 222 unanswered points !"
10167,i feel bad for the guys on cumberland 's team . a tome point they must have given up
10168,good evenings !
10169,"good evening , i can not believe that the bengals line backer has not been suspended for the late hit on antonio brown during the pittsburgh 's win sunday !"
10170,strange that the super bowl is now over and the burfict issue comes out again . he played college bal cout here and was just as volatile as he is now probably will get kicked out of hte league soon .
10171,"yeah , i agree it is too bad that the brit issue is rising again . it was a little childish of him to lie and accuse smith schumer of spitting oj them"
10172,hes a menace and a ability for the nfl who are trying the move away from the dirty layers and appeal more to mom 's wh do n't want their kids to play because it 's good violent
10173,"yeah i agree , it is too bad that it is appealing more to mom 's who do not want their children to play football day to the violent nature of the sport that is promoted on social media . it is interesting to note that there has been discussion about how the nfl should possible consider increasing rules about hitting players that are not quartrabcks ."
10174,"yeah , they 're stuck in a tight spot and if you make the game safer and less violent , they may lose fans . but if you do n't have kids playing football anymore , they wont grow up to be nfl players their talent pool drives up !"
10175,"i agree , i need kids to playng football and they nee ipod role modes to that them how good sportsmanship ! i would also love to see more females players on the football team because technmicallywomen re a ; slowed to play on the team as long as they meet the league 's eligibility requirements ."
10176,"interesting point about omen , i did n't this about that angle . i know some worn have been college kickers and had aspirations o play professionally"
10177,"yeah , i think it is really too bad that they re not considering female athletes who are just as capable as men in the sport . young female youth need more female athletes as their role models that they can aspire to be like ."
10178,"totally agree , i have two daughters adn love the role models they have in soccer and baskeball now . it would blow theirs in to see a woman on the football field . i think its creat that they have females ref or officials in the nfl nd nba"
10179,"i agree , having female refs or officials in nfl nad nba is a great start , but i definitely would some to see more athletes . another interesting fact s that the iowa 's locker room for visiting football team sis painted pink ."
10180,what ? that 's pretty sexist and demeaning regardless the sport . i would think that will be painted soon in todays climate i do n't pike jist !
10181,"really ? i kind of disagree , because i think if is a smart strategy that the use in order to give themselves an advantage during the game . therefore , from a game point perspective painting your opposing team 's locker room pink is a great move !"
10182,interesting point any advantage a home team can get over their opponent . i was thinking it may be antiquated in today 's pc climate .
10183,"that is a very good point , it would really be intereting to see data about how the opposing team is impacted . fore example , maybe they could analyze tbh tracing chips found on the shoulder ads to record a player 's every move on the field ."
10184,ii would think there woul indeed to be a psychological measurements of the fact of the pink walls . i 've heard about the chips in the padding and i wonde why they do n't put chip sin the ball to indicate if a ball breaks the plain of the endzone or sideline ?
10185,"apparently hey do use the tracking devices inside footballs to track the ball 's velocity , rotation , ball speed and location . i guess they do not advertise that as , much during official games though ."
10186,"fascinating how technologically advanced the game is in so aspects , but antiquated i nofficiating wheres they missed 3 lean ; ties on on replay in that saintsrams lame !"
10187,yeah i ca n't believe that they missed that even though the technology has become so advanced . you would expect them to track all this data especially when there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
10188,that stat has always baffled me 11 min of action . so much downtime and wasted time !
10189,"i agree , that would explain why the superbowl commercials are so popular . it is because most of teh game is just watching advertisement , with only 1 minutes of real live action ."
10190,super bowl commercials were soso this year . the burger king or andy carol one was the most memorable one for the wrong reasons !
10191,"i didn ot watch the super bowl commercial this year , but heard that they were very boring . a lot of my friends told me its sucked this year an nwas a waste of tim veto watch"
10192,"overall your friends are forget . i wasnt ' a fan of either team and watched it with friends , beers , food , good times terrible fame !"
10193,"that 's disappointing to hear , hopefully next year ot will be a better game !"
10194,maybe but i would n't be surprised if it was the patriots again . . . winning . . . boring as it is tube
10195,"yeah . , he are a tough team to beat . maybe one per will decide to quit like baker mayfield did in order to pursue a fulltime competitive career in gaming l that may give eh other teams a chance to make it to the super bowl !"
10196,i had no idea that mayfield wasted to quit football and be a pro game where would thas browns be without him ! ? ! ? !
10197,"i agree , in fact mayfield even boats that he can beat anyone t the game of halo 3 if they played against him in 1 on 1 game"
10198,"that 's crazy , even though i have not idea about halo 3 , he 's a great good qb"
10199,"hear , i agree , he has been a great quarterback since he was at the university of oklahoma ."
10200,"he 's great . hey , it 's been awesome chatting with you !"
10201,"yeah , he is , i would also ; the to see more left handed quarterbacks . i fins it fascinating that kellan , one is the only on for the nfl who is left handed"
10202,i 'm not sure i know ho kellan moore plays for ! ? ! ? !
10203,good afternoon . do you like the nfl ?
10204,hi homo are you ? i sometimes watch the nfl . you ?
10205,yes i usually watch every sunday although i did n't watch alot 7 regular season games his year .
10206,i didnt get a chance to watch this year . i hear the game was a bit slow .
10207,yes it was . the super bowl that is . did you know there 's only actually 11 minutes of life gameplay ?
10208,i heard that . it seems too little for so much money . i guess there is alot of time for commercials .
10209,yes i very much dislike commercials . di you knows he nfl has mo written rule against female players ?
10210,i cant imagine a woman playing in a game with such big buys . seems dangerous .
10211,yes it seems very dangerous . cheerleading is n't dangerous though . although the new orleans saints cheerleaders ca n't eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player .
10212,that rules is outdated and sexist . it must w from and ago .
10213,yes it really is . it needs to be changed ! the average lifetime earnings of engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player .
10214,"i would feel more comfortable if women had careers with less physical risk k , like engineering . less channel for concussions as well ."
10215,yes absolutely . bit is a tough game . i ' mad they get paid so much but in the past professional bowlers made twice as much !
10216,that was a golden age for bowling . that will never return . i guess i was born late lol
10217,you a big bowler ? i think it 's a fu sport . former nfl running back greenellis never noce fumbled the football ! i wonder if he is goo dat bowling ?
10218,he probably would have trouble letting gop of the ball ! lol
10219,ha ha yes good point . you know that circular huddle ? that was started by a deaf quarterback .
10220,a deaf quarterback ? why would he nee az circular huddle ?
10221,good question . so the other team can not read his hand signals . it was really lovely chatting with you today .
10222,that makes sense . i guess he could need to do that . i enjoyed chatting too .
10223,have a good one !
10224,"hi , do you watch football ?"
10225,"yes i do , i follow the nfl closely what about you ?"
10226,"from ti , e to time . did you watch the superbowl ?"
10227,"i did watch the eupebrol my favorite team a playing , did you watch it ? did anything specials of the game ?"
10228,we had a party so that was enjoyable . did you know women an play ?
10229,"they can play ? thats new for me , you know players have chips in their shoulders !"
10230,"yeah that is so cool , can collect lots of statistics"
10231,"i agree , it is cool , cool how tech can be implemented to a game , footballs lso have tracking chips and you can learn all kids of interesting stats out of them ."
10232,yeah . did you know engineers earn more than football players
10233,"j didn t , football players earn a lot of money so thats hard to believe i guess engineers also make a lot of moe"
10234,yeah they do and i find that really fair actually
10235,"i think its fair as well afterall engineers study work a long time , its fair like espn winning an emmy for the yellow line that represents first down on football"
10236,year i guests . do you know the highest score of a football game ?
10237,i dont m whats the highest score in a football game ?
10238,"2220 , that was a crazy win and loss for the other team"
10239,"wow , tha ti sa ridiculous win 2220 , w hat team was be enough to loser y that score ?"
10240,"georgia tech beat the cumbelrands , what a win"
10241,"i agree , did cumbelrandr entire from football after that defeat ? i know i would lol"
10242,"must have , i have no idea really ?"
10243,"i see , we , l did you ever watched benjarvus green ellis play ?"
10244,no but i know he never fumbled a football . nice chat
10245,"hey there , do you watch the nfl ?"
10246,"i do . some call it the national football league . i call it the never football league , since they only actually play a few minutes in back game ."
10247,i snow only 11 minutes of play time ye to are glued to thet v for so long watching those 11 minutes
10248,"over 17 weeks , that means one team only plays 1891 minutes per yea i and if you are a punter , maybe 3 minutes ?"
10249,something like that . did you know women an actually pals iv they want
10250,like any sane woman would wan that ? you know they televise the players age and weight every week ?
10251,i think it is more about the violence in the sport . i did a dangerous sport really
10252,yes it did . they put tracking chips in the helmets so eat they can tell the spouses the precise velocity of the helmet that caused the concussion .
10253,"yeah the techno , oy eve nor sports has come a really long way now"
10254,"yeah , that monitor the speed of the football , t he location of every layer , and whether cheerleaders are in the same restaurant as the players . . . a long if you1 re a saint !"
10255,i find that really strange want they even have to leave midmeal if the players walk in
10256,"i nope they at least get a doggie bag ! bowlers do n't have to put up with such rules ! you know , back in the day , bowlers made more money than nfl players , but that was years ago . . ."
10257,"yeah that is interesting too . speaking of football , espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line"
10258,a virtual line . that means they got an emmy for nothing . the players do all the work and they get recognized for imaginary lines .
10259,i know right ? do you have a favorite player position in nfl ?
10260,"depends on the team . 32 team saint hey all all the game a little diferent . on a runningcentric team , 8 admire the fallback and fallback positions , as well as the offensive linemen . on a throwing team , the qb is often th most admired . how about you ?"
10261,yeah i am going to go witht he quarterback too . did you know brady was never put is the game in high school
10262,"wow . epic lol for that coach . you kno w , brady 's fellow teammate , ellisgreen , never fumbled the ball even one during his entire career as a running back with the patriots ? that is admirable !"
10263,i know that is . do you know alex smith ?
10264,smart dude ! he had earned so many ap credits in hs that the college took him as a junior . now he uses his brain in the huddle as qb in the nfl . . .
10265,good for him talent and brains . nice chatting with you
10266,"hello thee , are you an nfl fan ?"
10267,i am ! i love how ben roethlisberger has the most franchise wins for the browns and he plays for the steelers lol . are you ?
10268,yeah big ben sure ha dominated the browns his whole career . i am a fan yeah but mostly of my fav team .
10269,who is your favorite team ? mine is the vikings !
10270,nice ! mine is hte hackers so we have had our fair share of good games .
10271,i agree ! i remember when brad johnson played for the vikings . he is teh only quarterback to throw a touchdown pass to himslef !
10272,"yeah i remember that ! i was a big art favre fan myself , heh ad slime good games for your vikings ."
10273,even better days with the packers haha . i d like watching college too . can you believe 14 of the world 's 25 biggest stadiums are for college teams ?
10274,"that is pretty crazy , di dog know the visitors locker room at iowa is pink ?"
10275,yes i 've actually been in it ! very cool and funny at the lame came . it 's no as cool as that high school stadium in allen teams that cost 60 million dollars to build !
10276,holy crap that is just insane ! i do n't think other colleges or high schools around the world have such big stadiums .
10277,"skates you wonder if they could have spent it elsewhere , o ever if they are good haha . i ca n't believe matt patricia was a rocket scientist before the nfl !"
10278,"wow that is very interesting , rocket scientist tofu fooball , what a switch !"
10279,you would think he would get bored coaching at thaat it haha . i also cant ' believe there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl .
10280,"that is a crazy fact about the nfl , d o you know the story behind the invention of the huddle ?"
10281,was n't it formed because of a deaf quarterback ? i forget his name though !
10282,"paul d . hubbard , yeah good call ! i thunk that is probably the coolest fact about football ."
10283,i wonder if they ran around to each player to give them the play abc then haha . do you know how they stretch the flag across the field every dem ?
10284,"yeah thats a good question lol . i 'm not sure , do you know ?"
10285,with a lot of people haha . it weights 1100 pounds and cost 500000 to make !
10286,"holy crap ! well it 's been fun and interesting talking with you , i hope you have a good day ."
10287,"hi , o you watch football ?"
10288,"yes i do , what about you ? do you like emit ? follow it ?"
10289,sometimes . did you know when can play ?
10290,i did n't but i guess i 'm not suprised because it makes sense that people with tube concerned for a womans safety in football . it 's amazon how much we spend on stadiums
10291,that is true . do you know how much game play there is in a game ?
10292,"i dont know , maybe 40 minutes i guess 5 minutes arent really gameplay but ads ."
10293,"yeah stat isp or sure , lots of downtime there"
10294,"yeah , there is a lot of wasted time in games , its unbelievable how much the flags at football stadiums weight !"
10295,for sure . do you know abot that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
10296,"no , what rule do tey have concerning cheerleaders ?"
10297,they are not allowed to eat . the same restaurant as the players
10298,"that is really unfair , that would should be eliminated and the team should receive a free for even having a rule like that , it , as me so angry !"
10299,me so it is wo sexist . yet worst is they have to leave mid meal too
10300,"i agree , so do you know who kellan moore is ?"
10301,is that the only quarterback that is left handed ?
10302,"he is , the only left handed of the league , brad johnson is another curious character , how did he manage to give himself a touchdown pass lol"
10303,"i would call like to see that , how he did i"
10304,"i wonder if the video is available at youtube , another interesting fact ia tthat only two african american quarterbacks have actually won the superbowl"
10305,yeah that is curious for sure . there are o many players of color
10306,"yeh dough williams and russell wilson apparently both of them played againt the brocmnos , theres another interesting fact about russell , want to know more about him ?"
10307,sure what else do you know ?
10308,"ok so he is so , l under a mlb contract even though h that not played in regular season since 2011 and even got traded in 2018"
10309,do you like football ?
10310,"hey there , yes i do i like kellan moore espeically"
10311,i hear he is the only left handed qb in the nfl .
10312,"yup thats true , i think it goes him an advantage , do you know the history of the circular cuddle ?"
10313,"no , what is i t ?"
10314,"it was a deaf quarterback , he 'd use it to cover up his signing from teh opposite test"
10315,"interesting , so they had to hide the hand signals ?"
10316,"yup exactly , did you hear that baker mayfield was almost a professional gamer instead of a quarterback k ?"
10317,"no , i wonder how much ew our have made ? it an pay fairly well ."
10318,"ya i agree , did you know how popular bowling was in the 60 ' ?"
10319,it was so popular that bowlers made more than footbal players .
10320,"yup twice as much , do you like the patriots ? they have w player who has never fumbled"
10321,"i 'm not a fan , i do n't hate them , but they are n't my team ."
10322,what o you think about the highest scoring football game of all time ? there core was 2220 thats crazy
10323,"i ca n't believe it , given that the average game only has a minutes of gameplay ."
10324,"thats rule , that seems so low though , kind of like the lifetime earnings of an nfl player compared to an engineer"
10325,"i 'm not surprised , engineers can make a lot nd add football pales maker are little ."
10326,"that is true , what do you think of the strange rules with the saints cheerleaders and players ?"
10327,"i think that the , while strange is pretty common , they have it for my job team too ."
10328,oh
10329,well nice chatting with you !
10330,"well , hello there ! how 's it going ? ready to chat ? do you like that there football ?"
10331,"hi there , yes i do like football . did you know women can play in nfl too ?"
10332,i 've heard as much . but will the day ever come ?
10333,"i am not sure actually , we will have to se it i mean all they have to do is play for 11 minutes"
10334,11pm minutes of action . years of training . maybe women could be kickers or something . maybe men could be sheer ; leaders too .
10335,yeah why not . did you know engineers actually earn more over the lifetime than football players ?
10336,"engineers are in demand 12 womans should become engineers , not football players ! fewer concussions ."
10337,yeah and better pay it seem . i guess it make sense sine the career of a football player is shorter too
10338,the career is short and dangerous . hard to be an engineer when your brain is broke . what do you think of u of iowa litle trick ;
10339,hm curious about i . i know pink clan be distracting so i wonder if that as the reason
10340,"pink was meant to calm them down , tune thee in pacifists ! it did n't work as far as i can see . they did n't win no emmy for a pink locker room ."
10341,true . what do you think about esp winning an emmy though for the superimposed yellow line ?
10342,"that is teh highlight of espn 's career . tey will never exceed that achievement . in fact , tv will never get better than that . a yellow line ! imagine !"
10343,i know . i fin dog kind of strange but as well l good for them . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
10344,is he a football player or something ?
10345,yeah he played for the patriots and is the only guy to have never fumbled the ball in his career
10346,i hope hat he got a bonus for such outstanding ploy ! must have been tough . everybody probably tried to get him to tumbled .
10347,"yeah , that is true . did you know bowlers used to make more thin football players ?"
10348,"bowlers have the war athletic build , that 's why . beer and pizzas nad big shiny 's . that 's all you needed back i teh 1960s ."
10349,i guess that explains it . do you know what the highest score in football history is ?
10350,"no i do n't , what is it ?"
10351,"it was pretty high for sure , 2220 , that is insane . nice chat"
10352,do you like football ?
10353,"9 have never been fond of sports in general . are you referring to gridiron foot ball , like we have in"
10354,"yes , i am . i 'm not such a fan of football either . football has gained so much popularity in the last few decades . in the 60s , topbowlers aide twice ss much as the top football stars ."
10355,"a current nfl player makes less in a lifetime than an engineer , busta n nfl player probably work salt less years ."
10356,that 's true . the football players have to learn tom manage their money well for the best to their lives . i assume that 's difficult for many .
10357,"that is probably true for most sports , the engineer make more than am lb in their lifetime ."
10358,following everything that goes on on the field in football is hard for me when i watch . sometimes i wonder how scoring can be objective . it 's interesting to know that players and footballs have tracking chips .
10359,having he yellow line for the first down makes it easier to watch .
10360,"yes , you 're right about that . it 's interesting that esp won an emmy for reacting that !"
10361,the technology makes it more fun and easier to follow . i ponder wat they use the teh chips in foot balls and shoulderpads to do .
10362,"the shoulder pad chips record the players every move and the footballs have tracking fot velocity , ball speed , rotation and location . technology is neat !"
10363,they spend lots of effort to track stuff in the 11 minute ot so of live game play .
10364,"right , i is crazy how little game play there actually is . maybe that 's part o 'the reason id o not like football ."
10365,"the quarterback touches hte football for most offensive plays , but that does n't mean hte other players hav much contact with the ball in th 11 minutes ."
10366,there is a lot of pressure on being a quarterback . i guess taht 's why they are paid more .
10367,"it was a deaf quarterback who invented the circular huddle , so hte other team couldnt read his signals ."
10368,that 's interesting to know and cool that they continue to use this method .
10369,"most quarterbacks are right handed , here is only on leftie currently in the nfl ."
10370,interestin . ? wonder why that 9s . do you think that he talked help lead into victory ? swearing of the redskins certainly does . his teammates say he is a fire starter and a maniac but it seems to help them win .
10371,usual calling a person ' crazy ' and a ' fire starter ' are not compliments but his teammate used those phrases as a compliment .
10372,right . it 's fun to see how passionate some nfl player are about their game .
10373,are you a football fan ?
10374,some waht but i do n't get to watch it anymore like i were to .
10375,i hear that . out of the 32 teams do you have a favorite ? i 'm a steelers fan .
10376,i eas green saw when i watched . the ave 16 weeks of game play and each team gets a week off .
10377,nice . i like how green bay is owned by the community . the nfl has no written rule against female players . maybe one day we 'll see one on the filed . maybe as a kicker ?
10378,that 's possible although im surprised we hae n't already . personally i think they should have their own league liek the wnba .
10379,they did at one time . i used to watch it a few years ago but it seemed like it was more for show . they wore shoulder pads but at the same time they were wearing shorts to show off their legs . ca n't remember the league name . did you know that there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay in an average nfl game ?
10380,i did not hat and it is hard to believe . the tracking chips are also in the footballs as well as teh shoulder pads .
10381,seems lie they are getting way too deep analyzing the game . did you know that espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line ?
10382,"i did and they line brought me great joy , lol . the super bowl is usually played the first week of february ."
10383,yes ? i look forward to the super bowl every year . do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was ?
10384,"i do no , was it a college . pro game ?"
10385,it was a college game in 1916 . georgia tech beat cubmelramd 222 . talk about a blowout .
10386,"wow , i would have not wanted to be on that bs ride home and sure it was the longest ride eve . you know that the iowa universities visiting locker room is painted pin k ?"
10387,lol yes . they must ave did that to try to mess with the opponents . how about patriots rb benjarvus greenellis ? ye has never fumbled the ball once during his career q
10388,now stat is an achievement ! do you know if he is in the hall of game for that ?
10389,i do n't know . curious to find out though . there is only one left handed qb in the nfl nd taht is kellan moore . i 'm not familiar with him .
10390,me either . did you know at one point bowlers made twice as muh as top nfl players ?
10391,i did n't . i wonder what the pay difference is now ? did you know that the circular huddle was created by paul hubbard who was deaf so the other team could not read his hand signals ?
10392,oh ok that makes sense . it was in the 60 's taht top bowler made twice as much . i doubt that they make ay where as much as them now .
10393,"i bet they are nowhere close . lol baker mayfijedl almost quit football to pursue a full time career in competitive video game playing , that would have been crazy . it was nice chatting with you ."
10394,hello do you watch football ? ?
10395,hey there i watch football from time to time . i watch the super bowl for instance . what about you . what d you like to watch ?
10396,"i dont really follow football , but i catchy he 49ers sometimes ."
10397,"yeah i 'm in michigan so i mostly watched the lions , although they suck hhaa . i do like tom brady though . apparently ther ware different variations of football . did you know that ?"
10398,different variations ? what do you mean ?
10399,"there are other variations of football such as australian rules , rugby football , or gaelic football . i dont ' know how those wprfkb ut they aware different versions for dire"
10400,oooh i see . i thought u meant in american football
10401,haha nope . i must have misspoke maybe haha . do you like snoop dogg ? he made a fight song fir his son 's football team
10402,"i used to like some of his music , that is pretty cool if him to do that ."
10403,neat it is . would you go to a football stadium tha cost 60 million to build ? even iv it was or a high school ?
10404,yeah probably just to see what it looked like so football generates so much money .
10405,yep it does . it 's also crazy that 14 of the 25 largest stadiums in the world are all america football team stadiums
10406,"taht is impressive . although , football is not popular all over the world so i guess that makes sense ."
10407,no you 're right . do you know the department of defense ? thet op three most rich salary employees are all football coaches somehow
10408,football coaches are part of the department of defense ? since when ?
10409,yeah i now right . taht 's definitely a lof of taxpayer money . what about quarterbacks . do you like in of them ?
10410,id dont shows any current quarterbacks except tom brady and eli manning .
10411,yep i like to brady a lot . i also know there 's a quarterback named ellen moore an dyes lefthanded . the only lefthanded player in the league
10412,wow thats pretty weird stat . i cant believe there only one left handed qb in the whole nfl .
10413,"i know right . i wonder if it gives jim an advantage or not . lso weird stat , only two black quarterbacks the ever won teh super bowl . i wonder why that is hat do you think"
10414,its been good chatting .
10415,hello are you a fan of the nfl ?
10416,not really . football seems overly complicated to me and it does n't seem like theres ' even taht much laying going on in a typical game
10417,no . that 's becasue there 's only 11 minutes of actual gameplay during a game . who do you think makes more over their careers . . an engineer or an average nfl or mlb player ?
10418,"if i had to guess , i 'd say an engine . they provide valuable services to our society and sports players are trained athletes but their jobs are really to entertain us"
10419,you 're right ! they make more over a lifetime . did you know that the nfl has no written rule preventing female players from playing ? i wonder if we 'll see one any time soon ?
10420,"really ? i always assumed they did , like mlb . that 's why women can only play softball ."
10421,"i 'm thinking that maybe we 'll see one get in there as a kicker . di you knows hat they put tracking chips in the footballs o record data like velocity , rotation , etc ?"
10422,"i did n't know that , but it makes sense after ' deflategate . ' i so n't think we 'll see a woman playing anytime soon , though ."
10423,maybe they would like to play at the university of iowa where hey visiting locker room is painted pink . wonder wh theyd id that ?
10424,"maybe veto spike them out . although maybe that backfired if it 's hot pin o , t hat 's a very stimulating for , and pale pink is very relaxing . should have painted it one which is offputting"
10425,'ve . i was thinking maybe for breast cancer awareness . in teh 1960 's top bowlers made ice as much as the top football stars of that era .
10426,"i gues people had better attention asians the name wanted to watch a slowermofinb sport . people back in the day were n't too smart , though . a high school rootbsallt cat had a terrible season and never even thought to use their second string players and one of those was the tom brady ."
10427,wow . i did n't now that . speaking of something terrible . . . . cumberland must have felt like that after georgia tech beat them 2220 in 1916 .
10428,"i think that 's called a shootout , right ? hopefully they 've recovered i nthe 100 plus years since hen lol"
10429,lol benjarvus greenellis must have been pretty good . the former patriots running back never fjmlbed the ball once during his career . that seems impressive .
10430,even more impressive : espn wond an emmy just for superimposing a yellow line on their broadcast . must ' b element he early days of special affects
10431,yes . amazing how far tv graphics have come . qb baker mayfield almost quit football to pursue competitive gaming full time . that would n't have been a smart move .
10432,competitive gaming ? like video games ?
10433,yes . is n't that crazy ?
10434,"it is . i mean , he would 've sustained less brain damage had he gone that route . long term issues from had injuries inn fl players is a huge issue"
10435,yes . they seem like they are taking steps to address it . i have to ge running . loved chatting with you ! have a great day !
10436,"hello , do you like football ?"
10437,yea but i do n't know if adele smith is a better qb than kirk cousins liken coach gruden said
10438,"hmmm i 'm not sure , i dont know kirk cousins ."
10439,"he was traded to the minnesota vikings , cousins did n't really have a good season"
10440,oh i see . i hear all smith took so many ap tests in high school he entered a university as a junior .
10441,"yea alex smith is really smart , before he was drafted he started w aster'zs degree"
10442,stats impressive .
10443,"tom brady is a pretty smart qb too , it 's a shame h never got to start for his jv high school team"
10444,"yeah their loss , they might ahve won that season lol"
10445,"or at least score a touchdown n , hopefully junipero serra high fired that zach"
10446,"apparently , there is only one left handed qb in the nfl"
10447,"yea , k kellan moore , i actually saw him on one of the football show on espn not too long ago"
10448,oh nice ! does he still play ?
10449,"i area ; lily di n't know if kellan moore still plays , i think he 's just espn 's only left handed football analyst"
10450,thats cool . did you kno win the 60 's top bowlers made almost twice as much as football players ?
10451,"nope , i knew in the 60s football players were n't pwi much but i did n't know bowlers made more"
10452,"kinda crazy , considering football player pretty much risk their health every game ."
10453,"yea and a to game only averages 11 minute of live gameplay , boxer soo longer than that"
10454,"yeah 11 min over a span of 3 hours , thats really long ."
10455,"yea , i wonder if they will ever have females player in the nfl since there are no rules against it"
10456,"that would be something . i guess if she is qualified i say let he play . its been great chatting , i learned a lot ."
10457,do you like american football ?
10458,"oh yeah , i am a huge fan ! i am a packers fan so aaron rogers is my quarterback ."
10459,"nice . quarterbacks seem to ended to have a higher iq tha na lot of other positions , which makes sense since they are in a leadership role for the offensive team ."
10460,"yeah , that is a good point . they have to learn all of the plays for the entire tea . the qb is the one guy who know everything going on or at least is suppose to know it all ."
10461,totally . they 're responsible for calling the whole play in the huddle .
10462,"yes , they have a lot of pressure . ya know the nfl does n't have a rule against female players ."
10463,"yeah , i love that . though it 's a pretty sexist industry , given the rule the saints have with the cheerleaders ."
10464,"yeah , they can not eb together or scene together . for instance if the players are somewhere that the cheerleaders are at then the cheerleaders must leave the location ."
10465,"that 's offensive . it sounds like omen are better off becoming engineers , as they make more money over a lifetime ethan a professional football player ."
10466,"wow , yeah the money part of the game is wild . i know that alex smith is one of the great qb 's who s really smart and makes a lot of money ."
10467,"does he ? i would think since he got all the way to his master 's degree before entering the draft , he would 've lost out on some money . ya know , if he had just entered after high school ."
10468,"yeah , that is a really good point . i agree with you . he was the overall 2005 draft ; pick . baker mayfield was tha overall pick from ou last year . we , or the college ou team , too ."
10469,can you believe mayfield once considered quiting altogether to pursue a gaming career ?
10470,what ? that is crazy . i ca n't even imagine what his parents would have said to him . i guess college kids a ; ; like gaming .
10471,"rings ? yeah , eh says he can beat anyone at his college i halo 3 . not sure how you can make much of a career with that !"
10472,"yea , i agree with that statement . lol . the university of iowa painted its visitors locker room pink , another type of game , i guess ."
10473,"just another example of the sexism in collegiate an professional football , i guess . can you believe bowlers in th 1900s made twice as much money as top football stars did ?"
10474,stat is as hame for sure . not fair at all . salary was not fair for the toll it took on the players bodies . i dont ' think bowling was too hard on he bowlers in comparison .
10475,i 'm not sure . it would be an interesting study . i know tennis players have a lot of wear and tear i heir bodies from the repetitive motion . . . i wonder what happened to bowlers bodies over the course of 1520 years swinging a 19 pound bowl backandforth .
10476,"hmmm , good point . the nfl has put chips into the gear in order to wrack things like impact and force of the hits taken . so progress is being made ."
10477,"yea , technology is crazy ."
10478,"hi , how are you ?"
10479,"pretty good , how are you ?"
10480,i am well . do you enjoy football ?
10481,i do was a little disappointed with the superbowl though .
10482,relaly ? why ? who were your rooting for ?
10483,well i was rooting for the rams but i would have liked to have seen a better game .
10484,that makes sense . who is your favorite team ?
10485,well if i had to pick between the redskins or bucks i would probably go with the sins . you ?
10486,"i am from chicago so i love the bears . do you watch football , ll a lot ?"
10487,i never get the chance to as i am always busy . i heard stat the only left handed quarterback is kellan moore .
10488,"that is true , although i find it hard to believe . o if not s ; forms , what do you do in your spare lime ?"
10489,do n't really have any at the moment . did you know that the eis af former patriot that ha never fumbled the ball .
10490,that 's crazy . one that the university if iowas visitor 's locker room is painted pink .
10491,i guess that 's a psychological thing . every bit helps i guess .
10492,"ga tech beat cumberland 2220 . i wonder if they have a pink , like room ?"
10493,wow that was nwas bake in 1916 right ? espn won an award for the superimposed yellow line representing the first down .
10494,seems line a low bar to win an emmy . nfl games only have 11 minutes of action .
10495,now that was hard to believe . almost as hard as the fact that bowler in the 60 's made more than nfl players ?
10496,yeah . or that the nfl uses chips to track players movement .
10497,i think that 's going it way to far . kind of liek new orleans cheerleaders having to leave a restaurant if a player comes in .
10498,nice chatting with you !
10499,is it true kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
10500,"i think so ! i always get him mixed up with kellyanne conway when i hear the name , though . do you think nfl is watcher overs here at the white house ?"
10501,kellyanne conway haha that 's funny .
10502,oh eve z ! probably ! i guess the cowboys are one happy nfl team now after the omari cooper trade . naive you years about it ?
10503,i haven ot heard of that 've been netflix binging lately . i had no idea a ; ex mitch was such an educated guy .
10504,"well , it 's not really big news . i guess the cowboys are happy because the redskins were leading but hen they overlook them . i wonder if it was an epic fooball game ?"
10505,it would ge nice to see the cowboy in a championship again . i like the history behind the huddle being to ep ad deaf quarterback .
10506,"yes , i remember learning about how hte huddle started in school ! very mart ! of as reading thati ne cowboys have so much confidence lately in th nfl that they think their offense is unstoppable ."
10507,those are some big words thinking they are unstoppable ? can you ever imagine a game score reaching anywhere near 2220 likd the georgia tech v cumberland ?
10508,i ca n't imagine ! the losing team must have been very embarrassed . i do n't think i 've ever see a of or any other sports game data ll with a score even close to that . have you ?
10509,no tha would be ridiculous . everyone in management would have to be replaced .
10510,"i think one of the most famous nfl quarterbacks is to brady ? i remember something about a footbal family comprised of a dad and wo sons that 's super famous , too . i think it 's th mannings ."
10511,oh yes hem manning another great football name . those guys were awesome . i think one of the brothers still plays .
10512,"i remember now , one of the brothers is eli short for elisha manning . unique name . i think quit epa few football players have unique names such as askew butt of the broncos ."
10513,yeah at least those were their given names and not something lke chad echo finch because of his number .
10514,that 's true ! i think atari cooper ha had many injuries in his nfl career . i 'm surprised the cowboys are so happy about that wide receiver ; the risk of re injury seems high in football games .
10515,yeah the sport has spend up a log and coming back from an injury always put shop at a higher risk of it happening again .
10516,i think cooper came from the raiders to teh cowboys ?
10517,yes i think thats how it worked out . so is there really chips inside players shoulder pads ?
10518,"i trink so ! the nfl even has those chips in the actual footballs . i wish i could have bought of that idea ! who knows how advanced footbal with be in a few decades , rights ?"
10519,no joke . can you imagine if helmets where stills but made of leather . collisions could become lethal .
10520,"that would be terribly dangerous ! i think i ' v heard the nfl doing education courses as to how to still make contact but avoid injury . strategic , almost like martial arts . hope they teach young football players , too !"
10521,"hello , how are you today , do you have time to chat for a bit ?"
10522,did your nfl team start 02 this year ?
10523,unfortunately it has
10524,they have less than a 5 percent channel of making it to the playoffs then
10525,well it 's good that i 'm not a huge fan of fl
10526,you must be watching the inspiring broncos oakland game right now ?
10527,yes but just on in them background with the tv muted
10528,the seattle offense have reilly been proving themselves the past couple nukes . do n't you think ?
10529,"somewhat , they 're doing somethings well and slacking on more of the basic ."
10530,j . j cat has a deal chance at winning defensive player of the year again this year
10531,i agree and they bill 's performance lately shows it .
10532,if you are psy watching the raiders and broncos game i can let you go
10533,yeah if you do n't mind i ca n't keep my eye off th raiders strong defenses jed sacks
10534,russel winston was slacked five times in yesterday game
10535,i was watching and it was glorious
10536,seattle has tube 2nd best offense in the league this year
10537,there runvlocking is horrible though sk i do n't see them having much of a chance this year
10538,deshaun watson . amzing another mvp like year
10539,it appears his ankle is finally getting better i just hope it can hold up through teh season
10540,he has help from jj walt if all else fails
10541,"true , i just wish the rub ; locking was on par with hte rest"
10542,ny has a worse defense ethan buffalo or arizona
10543,"hello there , do you know who tommy mcdonald was ?"
10544,he was a terrific football player who helped my team the bagel too the nfl hampiosnhip in '60s .
10545,"yeah tha is night , good call ! wel 'you certainly had a wild season last year !"
10546,"close on this year too ! i wish mcdonads would have been around to help , but he unfortunately died at the age of 84 . he was a hall of famer ."
10547,yeah i was sad to hear about him passing . i was glad he made i into the hall though .
10548,he started out as a twotiem all american in oklahoma and played 12 seasons for the nfl making th euro bowl 6 times . he was quite a player for his small figure at 5 foot 7 inches .
10549,"yeah that i do cool , i love it when those tiny guys make it big . i was a big fan of muggsy boggles and earl hopkins in the nba . are you a big footbal lean king senegal ?"
10550,"not particularly , but i like the super bowls . if women started playing , that would be fun to watch . the nfl has n rule against it . i would cheer them on ."
10551,yeah i think that is so cool and i definitely hope to see a women playing in the nfl sometime soon !
10552,i do like bowling though . are you a bowler ? in the us 's they made that me more than football players .
10553,"yeah 9 like to bow land really ! ? that is so crazy to think about , i would like to sew a gaps that shows how they overlapped as time when by ."
10554,"perhaps if i benjarvus greenellis were around ten , the football players may have made more money with his impressive no fumble in his nfl career ."
10555,"wow , i did n't know that , super impressive . i wonder how many total carries he had during his career ."
10556,i 'm not sure but with only 11 minutes of live gameplay in the average game it still is impressive .
10557,"yes i think i have read that before , you mean like not counting all the breaks right ? that seems like so little !"
10558,the balls and players are constantly tracked though . all this technology adds to teh game an extra tactic not used back in tommy mcdonalds time . i bet no tracking chips were used then .
10559,yeah i do n't think they had that kind of technology then . i know they use trackers sin helmets for safety inte.igecne .
10560,"do you listen to games on hte radio ? if you do , you can also hear jupiter 's radio storms on the am stations ."
10561,"i do when i have to , i reaaly like the local radio station we have here , they play lots of oldies . wow , that is a crazy fact ! jupiter is so far away !"
10562,sure is nd it rounds like soldiers who also were probably far away from home made radios out of just a razorblade and pencil diode . that was very inventive .
10563,"that is an awesome fact , never knew at one as well . it wa nice chattin with you , i hope you have a good night ."
10564,"hello , co you like football ?"
10565,"hello there l i do liek football , did you watch the super bow lrecetnly ?"
10566,i did actually . what i did not know was that there were of 11 minutes of game play
10567,yeah thats about the average actual gameplay during a regular game . there are lots of stops and reviews and all .
10568,yeah land all the ads . did you know women can play ?
10569,yeah i think that would be so cool if a female player made a pro roster in the near future .
10570,"yeah ish are that we see the at some point in the future , would make the game more fun"
10571,"it would , and it would give young girls something to motivate them to achieve an sorts of goals ."
10572,that is very true . did you hear about that rule that applies to end orleans cheerleaders ?
10573,"yeah i read about that , it seems a bit silly and outdated if you ask me ."
10574,i think it is really messed up an knot sure how it is still around
10575,"yeah i agree , did you know about the average lifetime earnings ?"
10576,"yeah they make less then engineers , but then again their career is shorter"
10577,"that is what i figure he is , that the average career of a pro sports player is so much shorter ."
10578,yeah . did you know not they are doing chips to track the players in the field ?
10579,"yeah i read about that , i think in helps them develop better safely features as well ."
10580,"yes that makes sense . how about hte radio , to you listen to it ?"
10581,"yeah i do , i found a good local station that i really like . how abut yourself ?"
10582,"yes me too . if you listen on the am , you might catch jupiter 's storms"
10583,yeh is n't that so cool ! very interesting .
10584,"yeah for sur . nice chatting with you : ,"
10585,did you know thay jupiter 's storms are so strong that you cna in them up on your am radio !
10586,"hello there , no that is so cool though ! are you a big fan of astronomy ?"
10587,"i know a little bit about it , what about you ?"
10588,"yeah i like it quite a bit . i 'm a fan f the radio as well , i really enjoy my local stations ."
10589,ya did you know that you can make a radio out of a pencil and razorblade ? i guess they did that in wwii
10590,"that is such ac do fact . another interesting thing about the radio is that in canada , 40 percent of the music ; called over the radio has to be canadian ."
10591,"that is interesting , i do n't know how good that sounds though , only a few canadian bands that i know and i ca n't say i like them that much haha"
10592,yeah thats what i thought too . i bet a lot of people do n't think thats a very good la wool .
10593,"haha but it does sound better than the finnish radio station hat does a weekly news program completely in latin , that souds worse haha"
10594,holy cow that sounds awful . did you know there is a website where you can listen to old radio dramas for free ?
10595,"no i did n't know that , i would check that out i bet there 's some gems on there , are you watching the superbowl later ?"
10596,yeah i think that is so cool . yeah i 'm going to be watching who do you think will win ?
10597,"well i hope the patriots win personally , l what is shocking is that the average game only has about 11 min of live gameplay haha"
10598,i think they will win as well . and that is so crazy to think about . i do know you notice it much more when attending lived games .
10599,"ya i have n't been to a live game in years , and i did n't know that women could technically play ford the nfl which would be interesting"
10600,i think that would be so cool if we did get a female player in the league . i think that would be awesome for young girls around he world that are interested i esports .
10601,"ya i think it would add a new dimension , i have the game later does n't have a blowout show like the highest score in in football game ever , 2220 haha"
10602,"holy crap , i think i read about that before , was n't it a college game ? they would have to come a touchdown on every play basically lol ."
10603,"haha ya when true score got to be 1000 i think i would just leave , cumberland must have felt horrible after that loss haha"
10604,"yah l , i wonde what thye halftime talk in the coach was lol ."
10605,"haha ya like , all right guys we have no chance just go to sleep ohh aha"
10606,"hi , d o you watch football ?"
10607,i watched parts o 'the last superbowl . i have a passing knowledge and passing interest in football so i am on and off
10608,nice . did you know university of iowa ha slanted the visitor locker room pink
10609,do you know why ?
10610,i have no idea m maybe discourage them in some way
10611,"indeed , perhaps sit is a mental thing to catch the off guard . so are you familiar with th nfl ?"
10612,yeah with some of it . i know football players used to make less than bowlers back in the day
10613,i could n't believe that the strange nfl game is only 121 minutes
10614,i know yet we are glue to that tv for hours on end
10615,i admit a lot and i mean a lot of action goes on in those few minutes . i mean the nfl is even putting chips in the hall and shoulder pads to get better data
10616,"yeah that must come in handy . espn won an award , an emmy"
10617,i admit their yellow line which they got an emmy for definitely and the game much more digestive for the audience
10618,seems that way . do you know what he highest score in history is ?
10619,i'n no sure but it must have been a blast a difference of 150
10620,"it was 2220 , georgia tech beat the cumberland"
10621,"i wonder if georgia tech was just that good , cumberland was what bad , or perhaps a but of both"
10622,i think it was a combination of both
10623,that doest opened most plausible . georgia tech must have had talents like tomb ray or green ellis
10624,not sure who played in their team but must have been boring to watch too
10625,"from . perhaps surprising until 50 pts , entertaining until 100 pts , and dull until 222 points"
10626,yeah i guess . nice chat
10627,food evening . are you a football fan ? did you know here lisa actually a new league starting tonight t ?
10628,"no , i did not know that . i do n't watch a lot . football , but i do know some interesting bits of trivia about it . honestly , playing the game was more my brother 's gig . he got a football scholarship in college . did you know foe instance , the highest score ever in a football game was 2220 ? can you imagine being beat that badly ? yikes !"
10629,"i cna't even imagine a score like that ! if you , or your brother , are curious , it 's cal ; led the alliance of american football and it 's actually connected to te nfl now ."
10630,"id id hear they were also trying to revisit he xfl , that 's the football league un by the wwe wrestling organization . never caught it the first time around , so i ca n't say if bringing it back is a good idea or but . . ."
10631,i think that is scheduled for 2020 so the spring will be interesting . did you happen to catch the super bowl ? it seems ike it 's one of the rare singleelimination finals in our us sports .
10632,"no i did n't see it , heard it was n't the greatest though . they even tried about the group performing at half time , maroon 5 , although i understand they had a hard time even getting anyone to perform . wonder if they commercials were any good this year though . . ."
10633,"it was a defensive struggle , m maroon 5 was really just adam levine showing off , and the commercials were rather bland . it 's crazy to think that in terms of actual gameplay , teh halftime dope was longer as an average nfl game jist uae about 11 minutes of live action ."
10634,"11 minutes ? it 's hard to believe there 's so litle factual action in a game ! wonder if any of the teams played any trick o each water , like how university of iowa has their visiting team 's locker room painted pink ! hehe . . ."
10635,being from nebraska i know all about iowa 's ploy to gain any psychological advantage !
10636,"yeah , it 's kind of interesting . . . they 've done studies and found color 's really o effect people psychologically . read about an experiment where they painted a weight room pink and they fond the lifters could't lift as much as they normally could . crazy , huh ?"
10637,yep ! another crazy thing to me is that bowlers used to make more than football players !
10638,"oh yeah , that was back when bowling was a huge thing theyd ' even have celebrity bowling tv shows and stuff . seems grossed unfair though , given ow injury prone football players re ."
10639,"absolutely . especially when you factor in thagt despite all football players seem to make , an engineer makes more over a lifetime ."
10640,"neat litle auto . . there 'd actually no rule against women being football players in the nfl . if they met the league 's eligibility requirements , t hey could sign right up . not sure if that 'll happen though . . ."
10641,"t does seem like a stretch due to the physical differences . it is interesting that apparently a woman can play for hte not , but a saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if a saints player comes in ."
10642,"oh , wow , guess theyre serious about the two not fraternizing ."
10643,they must have ! i wonder which group it protects ? they definitely invest in weird players . did you know they have made chips to track about every movement on the field a player makes ? '
10644,"yeah , i heard about that . . . they 've got a chip in the ball as well . . . probably makes it easier to go statistics and whatnot . especially since it can kempt rfk of velocity , rotation and speed ."
10645,amazing how far it 's come . i bet there was a time just getting a radio broadcast of the game was huge !
10646,i remember back when all the had was madden using the white ' chain ' lines and now they 've got all these cool graphics and stuff to help everyone keep track of what 's going on . . . it 's pretty amazing .
10647,thanks for the chat ! it 's time for some football !
10648,"hey , you too ! have a great evening !"
10649,you too !
10650,hello how are you doing today ?
10651,i am good . just missing football season . i ca n't wait for the 32 teams to get back out of the field in the fall !
10652,i love football too . wo i you team ?
10653,i a from florida so i root for the dolphins even though they are terrible ! the dolphins upset most of their 16 games a season . how about you ?
10654,ahh ai 'm from ohio so i root for the cincinnati bengals .
10655,hard to believe nfl football has been played since 1932 . the field was 80 yards back then .
10656,that 's cray . there 's no written rule against female players in the nfl .
10657,"i would like to sees ome female players . , i bet they would be very strategic ."
10658,it would be interesting . an average nfl game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
10659,have you ever seen snoop dogg 's son play ? he ' pretty good ! snoop writer a song for the high school team his son was on .
10660,"i heard he 's really good , but have never seen him play ."
10661,i enjoy listening to games on the radio . the use of air waves and electromagnetic energy waves is a great way to costume football .
10662,i love listening game son the radio as well . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than an average nfl and mb player .
10663,engineers are the creators of the tracks chips the nfl uses to measure player moves on the field .
10664,that 's a cool technology . at with can help out with concussions and other injuries through data .
10665,tha would be amazin ! a brilliant engineer stat now coaches in the nfl is named matt patricia .
10666,that 's cool . the highest eve football score was 2220 .
10667,humiliating score for the losing team ! they probably did not make it to the super bowl o nthe first sunday in february .
10668,former patriots greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career
10669,"that is impressive ! he deserves a nice stadium , like the allen , texas one taht cost 60 million ?"
10670,it wa agreat talking to you !
10671,"hi , how are you doing tonight ?"
10672,great . are you in one of the 32 nfl cities ?
10673,"at the moment , no . but i grew up near are . how about you ?"
10674,"i am in phoenix , one of the 16 nfc cities . unfortunately , we have the number one draft choice which means the worst record ."
10675,"well , its ' a rebuilding year . happens took many team . who do you think you 'll get ?"
10676,i would hope kyler murray but the defensive guy from ohio state is most likely . the season is 17 weeks even thoughhe zach team only played 16 games .
10677,does anyone care about th asexual preferences of the players in the nfl these days ?
10678,"i have heard a little humbling , but i thought it was about gender rather than homosexuality . what have you heard ?"
10679,have n't heard . i know that there is no rule against women . what 's the story ?
10680,i think that some teams just worry abou pr challenges . i take a team chemistry to win . i expect to see a woman kicker someday . no rule against women in the nfl .
10681,"yeah , aw roman kicker makes sense . could come over from soccer ."
10682,"great point . imagine the income that players get from only 11 minutes of action in each game . if you play defense or offense , that is 5 . 5 minutes for you ."
10683,that 's a pretty good perminute salary . it 's quite different from basketball and soccer .
10684,"true . i started my career as an negineee handm and about 4 million so far . my neighbor was a running back for the cardinals and he mad 7 million in his last season . but on average , engineers make more that nfl players over a career ."
10685,maybe your neighbor could become an engineer later in life after he retires from football . the earnings of an engineer are good . women should go to that instead of football .
10686,"there is a push for womb in stem . he coaches running backs for another nfl team now , so he is doing okay . brand new porches in his driveway this week . in new orleans , the cheerleaders can not dance in the same restaurant as a player . the cheerleader has to leave if a player comes in ."
10687,"i think that 's an outdated sexist system . parents , do n't let your daughters grow up to be cheerleaders ! teach 'em engineering !"
10688,"those nfl salaries took a while to grow . in the 1960 's , top bowlers earned more than nfl players ."
10689,"tip bowlers were uk that the professional leagues did n't have their act together cc college ball was big , and tv havne't grown enough ."
10690,"you are right . also , hte nfl has to pay a lot more players than the 10 or 12 top bothers . that espn yellow line that marks the line to gain for a first down has been a nice improvement for tv watchers ."
10691,"it has been an improvement , but does it deserve an aware ?"
10692,nice chat !
10693,"i did not know that jupiter had radio systems . do , i know that earth is not that only planet with radios ."
10694,i did n't know that jupiter ad radio system either . do you think that life on jupiter ?
10695,"well , i am imagining it right no w , but on jupiter it woul be dark cuz the sun is so far away ."
10696,yes k that 's what i learn i wonders or years diff man actually visit these planets . if the did a may had place items on these planets .
10697,"well , maybe nasa had a certain technique and systems o bring astronaunts to space ."
10698,yes i pretty sure they do . have you ever heard of sun 's music ? i have any real what is sun ' ? s music .
10699,i bet that is a lot of money for nasa to use in making machines and satellites over there . no i ahve not .
10700,"that 's true , i wonder why dc resident called tube nfl eagles the america 's team ."
10701,that i interesting . i do n't recall . i think they do th super bowl last year against the patriots .
10702,that did you think about sunday 's super bowl games ? do you think the entire game was exciting ?
10703,"i think it was excited when they were tied 3 . once i saw 4th quarter , i already knew it was a win for the patriots . i like the halftime show ."
10704,"has , il ike the halftime show and commercials . i agree i knew who will win also rams is a rather young team ."
10705,i am so happy that adam levied ha some special guests . xmas can wi another year . they should feel lucky to actually be in the super bowl .
10706,"yes they should , d , but they came from such a long ways to lose against a team that already won five super bowls hmapionships ."
10707,this gives hte moor tiem to practice and develop strengh and ability . it 's never too late . when was the last time they won a super bowl game ?
10708,"i am not sure the exact year , but i think the us , s lost are . they play several games against new england and lost ."
10709,"wow , against he patriots . once the rams know the patriots are against them , they either know that they will lose or they wil leave a chance to win ."
10710,"true , what team is your favorite team , or you do n't have a favorite team ? pittsburgh is my favorite team ."
10711,i think i mentioned earlier that the 49ers are my favorite team .
10712,"no , according to my knowledge this is the first time that question by me . i like them ."
10713,"all might , i will go now ."
10714,they ! do you like football at all . . . .
10715,love it and sad it is over for the year . i teams like the season goes so fast . you know the reason is only 17 weeks wish one bye week . not enough football for me .
10716,might ! i love football but rarely get to follow it . i sometimes listen to the games on the radio lol . . . always busy . . . .
10717,did you know that jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can b picked up and heard by an am radio . i wonder what that sounds like !
10718,"really ? i really need to try and tune in so i can hear that , an a . m radio station huh ? i will check it out ! there is a website that plays old classic radio dramas for free ."
10719,i love som talk radio so that channels may be fun to listen to ! i canada the music on their radios havent o be at least 40 percent must be canadian .
10720,"wow , i bet so the canadian can get good radio air time . i get that . i was listening to a talk radio show and they were saying an nfl game on average only has a mere 11 minutes of actual live play . . . . that 's crazy !"
10721,i know . . . you think that football players get paid the big bucks but i heard in he long run you are better off being an engineer . they tend to ahve higher than average lifetime earning of both a nfl and mlb player !
10722,"no way ! i never would have thought that at all . ? . . very interesting . i like the fact that the nfl has no written rules against women playing football , as long gas they meet their requirements ."
10723,better than being a cheerleader . . . the new orleans saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player and they even have to leave if one comes in yo eat . talk about double standards !
10724,"that i just wrong g , i wonder if that is true to this day or something of the past . . . . just like the locker room ewing painted all pink in the university of iowa 's locker room for the visiting team lol"
10725,that is sure to annoy the visiting team ! did you know that in the 60s top bowlers made more money than football stars . crazy ! does n't sound right !
10726,"that is truly crazy ! i bet that is not the case in present times lol . i wonder if they still use the tracking chips put into players pads to record their every move . . . . and inside footballs to track velocity and rotation , speed very interesing !"
10727,thank goodness no oj is tracking how slow we m 12 you know the game footbal means different sports to different people . i soccer in some countries is called football in others . so confusing !
10728,"haha , met 's ! that is interesting and makes sense ! i wonder if they tracked they game that was won 2220 back in 1916 . . . . that is awesome , what a score !"
10729,wow ! i feel sorry for hte team that lost . was n't it cumberland ?
10730,"yes ! i was actually . they played against georgia tech . pretty amazin g , just like ow former patriots rb neveda fumbled a ball ever , in his nfl career !"
10731,patriots are an amazing team . . . love or hate them theyd ave the talent . did you watch the super bowl this year ? it is usally held the first sunday of february .
10732,"i did n't get to see the superbowl this year , bt i heard it was an awesome game ? the patriots are definitely a great team . sould gavel moved to ahve send the game !"
10733,me too ! well maybe next year with the season starts in september you can make it to a game e .
10734,might ? i wish definitely make it to a football game this year .
10735,i hope so ! it wa nice talking to you . ave a good day !
10736,it has been great ! you ahve a great day too !
10737,do you like football ?
10738,yes i do . u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
10739,i ponder if thay is supposed to have some effect on the players
10740,i wonder too . bowlers make more money than them though in the 60s
10741,i guess football was not that popular back in th bday either though
10742,true ? do you know what the highest score is college football is ?
10743,yes that is georgia tech beating cumberland 2220
10744,yeah and that was way back in 1916 nad is still a record
10745,yeah . di you know espn won a emmy once ?
10746,yes that was for the superimposed yellow line
10747,yeah . did you know benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball ?
10748,"wow , what a guy . do you listen to the radio ?"
10749,yes i do . you can listen to jupiter 's storms in am radio
10750,nice . do you ever listen to canadian radios ?
10751,yes sometimes but they play a lot of music from canadian artists
10752,"yes they are required to dot hat by law , 40 percent of it has . be canadian"
10753,true . do you now how soldiers made foxhole radios during wwii ?
10754,yes they used pencils and razorblades to make those
10755,yes . do you listen to radio dramas ?
10756,yes there is a free website where you can listen to hem too
10757,yes that is so convenient . nice chatting with you .
10758,"hello , do you at a lot of football '"
10759,i do sometimes . how about you ?
10760,"actually , i do n't . only for big games like the super bowl etc . did you know the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ? ?"
10761,i know isnt that crazy s long as a game lasts . did you know in the 60 's bowler made twice as much as the top football players .
10762,now that is pretty awesome . i like bowling . him it take less much skill as football . i didn ' realize girls could play in the nfl if they met the eligibility requirements .
10763,i think guys would give them a hard time but it 's coo . and i the are on he university of iowa visiting them they get a pink locker room
10764,"that would be great . cant ' say i like teh rules about the mo saints ' cheerleaders . apparently they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player already in the restaurant . plus if a player ome sin after , hte cheerleaders have to leave . unbelieveable !"
10765,i think that 9s crazy . if they are at away game what are they chances of them running intro a players t a restaurant if i wonder if they enforce it .
10766,i wonder why it is a rule . something must have happened o cause them to come up wit that one !
10767,tha is true . and i think it is interesting then fl uses tracking chips in their players shoulder pads
10768,"walk in all , i think football i pretty scientific with all the playes and strategies they come up with . those chips track all their moves and helps the coaches resign their moves . pretty genius ."
10769,trade . can you believe there was a game lof a score of 2220 . how is that even possible .
10770,either ga tech was really good or cumberland was reaaly bad . how about patriots ' running back benjarvus wo never fumbled the ball in his entire career ?
10771,that is a great accomplishment . did you know spun won an emmy for the creation of th superimposed yell ; low line .
10772,that is pretty cool . i need a the tv explanations that go on during tha games . otherwise i would be so lost sometimes . espn is the channel we watch for all sports .
10773,i like espn for some things . i do espn 2 for ufc events adn it has not been a good experience .
10774,"that 's too bad . did you hear that the cardinals ' a dorian peterson is buying his linemen mattresses because they did s we i the last am . i guess they were pretty horrible enforce . he was to make sure they sleep well . : ,"
10775,that is nice of him to do . nfl player make a lot of money but it 's interesting tha engineers make more money than all players
10776,"they use a lot of rain power ! btw , im meant to had the redskins no cardinals . : ,"
10777,do you like to listen to the radio ?
10778,yes i do . i have a long commute to work so the radio keeps me sane ! hey nice chatting . have a great rest of the day !
10779,hi how are you ? do you like radio ?
10780,"still like to listen , but fav . local station switched to ' talk ' radio , no music , so . yrs . ago . do you have a fav . radio show ?"
10781,i dont but i try to catch up on the bet . i used to listen to a lot of music on the radio when i do younger .
10782,do you listen to podcasts today ? any particular sports broadcasts yo follow ?
10783,ike dont listen o sports stuff . i usually try to listen o news . do you listen to sports podcasts ?
10784,"not regularly . occasionally learn something intereting g , though : did you know redskins rb , adrian peterson stated recently that he 's buying king mattresses for his offensive line because ' . . . having these guys up front creates holes ' for peterson to run through . that was fun to listen to ."
10785,lol . that is great ! maybe i should take a listen to some of this stuff . it sounds great !
10786,peterson was quoted on pro football talk podcast . do you have a fav . pro team ?
10787,"at the moment , no . i used to follow tubes 49ers ."
10788,"san francisco ! that is , if that city still hosts that that . . . htey keep switching ! did you see feb . super bowl ?"
10789,"yeah , that moved the stadium to another city . i did not . i usually try to watch . did not have a chance this time . did you watch ?"
10790,"yes , dwight , . brady and the patriots got 6th win . a bit tired of that franchise , though tom brady is a legendary qb . beat the la rams . you did n't miss much . hs football is more fun , i think . do you follow or see local teams ?"
10791,"i dont . i am concerned that the sport can cause a lot of problems . the concussions could be a problem for hs players . i like the one , bust player safety is key ."
10792,"well said , and because of fan 's valid concerns , game is changing a ut my dad , who coached hs football for 41 yrs . , used to say is biggest concern was boys ho would not report injuries to him . . . less of an issue today , do you think ?"
10793,i dont know . the problem is that injuries are expected but kids want to play . i did not play football because of my concern about injuries . i figured other sport swede safer .
10794,you figured right . do you suppose soccer is safer ? sure is popular worldwide . . .
10795,"soccer is safer , but the guys are chimps . they make fouls . the women are tougher ."
10796,"i see . college football is huge in my region ? did you know that 14 of the world 's 25 biggest stadiums are college stadiums liek our beaver stadium , penn state , ."
10797,"i figure that the stadiums have became places of worship . i enjoy sports , b ut they should knot ovcershadow the mission of the university . anyway , great chat 2"
10798,agree . very well said . cheers !
10799,have a good day !
10800,tanks .
10801,hi this are you ? do you listen o the radio ?

10803,i dont listen to it much now . i used to listen a lot as a kid .
10804,i listened to it more when i was a kid for sure . cats all be used to have . do . i sound old .
10805,"i used t listen or music , then do news . now i go to youtube ."
10806,"you tube is awesome . did you know that bi , l murray used to love the fantastic four radio show ."
10807,"i did not know that . that must have been a long time ago , before his film career ."
10808,yeah it was . in 1948 bing crosby records filled more than half of the radio tim for recorded music . he was pretty popular .
10809,he was the voice do radio . then sinatra we along . he probably got a lot of radio play too .
10810,i would say so . you still him every once in awhile now a days . old blue eyes . isnt that hat they called him .
10811,"yes , he was quite slender in the old days . they said you had to tie a knot in his arm to give whim an yellow ."
10812,i did not know that but him . imagine a ventriloquist being the most popular act on a radio show .
10813,"yes , people really can seem simple sometimes . but i bet the line are funny ."
10814,they most have been . i bet a lot of kids listened to it . i can picture all te kids gathering around a radio every sunday for the new show .
10815,"yeah , there probably was not much else to do for entertainment . watch the grass grow ?"
10816,they could play with there ball hooked to a paddle . lol .
10817,"yeah , that silly old game . or hoolahoops ! yah !"
10818,so are you a football fan ?
10819,i sometimes watch . i guess the super bowl is good . i didnt watch it this year . you ?
10820,i didn twitch it either . did you know that snoop dog wrote the fight song to his sons football team .
10821,"snoop ! probably keep it g rated . anyway , great chat !"
10822,lol . have a great day .
10823,"hi , do you watch football ?"
10824,"not very much . i did watch my saints in the playoffs ; the final playoff game was painful . but , i do have season tickets to lsu footbal !"
10825,nice . did you know women can play too ?
10826,"i figured as much , considering we had a wo , an ref in the nfl playoffs . i just do n't know when they will break thru thati glass ceiling . what i find interesting is the use of fetch in football , like tracking chips to record hit ' g ' forces ."
10827,yea that is nice . and they ca 8track so many more statistics with those chips
10828,"football , and othe esports , have odd traditions and superstitious . did you know saints cheerleaders can not be in the same restaurant with any nfl player ?"
10829,i finds hat very sexism . the worst is that they have to leave even midmeal
10830,"i agree . it seems like what is of field should remain off field . it carries over aoc college football as well . the university of iowa painted the visiting football team locker pink . i don ot knoe if it was i humor , intimidation , or a bit of both ?"
10831,i think pink tv a color that causes distraction so maybe it was to help their own team
10832,"probably a carryover rib machoism . but , you can say technology has really changed the game . we have tracking chips in the uniforms and th ball and sway radio in th qbs helmet . it sure has changed a lot from the days of hand signals between the qb and the coach on the sideline !"
10833,or sure . did you now bowlers used to make more than football players back in the day ?
10834,"i did not know that . we often here about the mega contracts the sar players get but not th contracts of the average and 2nd string players . i recently learned that because of the short career in pro football , the average lifetime earnings of a typical nfl player is less than the lifetime earnings and an engineer . unfortunately , too many football players do n't invest wel , for their after football days ."
10835,i guess not . i mean they still get paid more nowadays but a lot of them take on secondary jobs to make ends meet
10836,true . there are just not that many positions in sports tv and radio for retired nfl players . esp chat a good suite of nfl retires and has made tech work for them . did you know espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow line to show the first down location for theirs viewers ?
10837,yeah that is quite the achievement for them to win an award for that
10838,i grew up in a very rural area where tv reception was poor ; so we listened to the net on the am radio . do you still listen to live radio or have you migrate over to internet streaming and podcasts ?
10839,yeah i do from time to tiem . curious to know if i can watch jupiter 's storms in there
10840,"neat would be interesting . i wonde rift astronomers an predict or time the so that we can know when and how to they it . its interesting at in canada , in an effort to preserve local culture , all radio stations are required by law t play 40 percent canadian music . i hope they have many other performers nd not justin bieber , lol , !"
10841,haha one would hope because jsut justin would be boring . but good for them for supporting canadian talent
10842,"true . we do the same hating down in louisiana . not by law but in the interest of retaining our cajun , creole , and zydeco musical heritage . with respect tnt heritage nad history , did you know that a finnish radio station as a entire weekly news program in classical latin . i wonder how many listeners fellow and understand the centuries old dead language ?"
10843,i really wonder about that too but if they are still in business that must mean the ave plenty of listeners
10844,true . well its about see to go . the dogs are starting to go off when they want their supper . they use pretty good at her football with respect to recovering fumbles . if i could upset get them to stay bounds !
10845,well have a do one . nice chat
10846,do you watch or play football ?
10847,yes i do . my favorite team is teh eagles . rid you know that in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as footballs stars ?
10848,relaly ? it 's amazing how much popularity football has gained since then . now we keen have a superimposed yellow line ethan espn for an emmy for .
10849,i did n't know about the superimposed yellow line . did you know that the highest score ever in a football gmail was 2220 ?
10850,"wow , i wonder what happened ! i 'm not really into football as there are only 11 minutes live gameplay on average in a game but that sees pike it wild have been an interesting game to watch ."
10851,yes it doe sr th eifel has no written rule against female players . if ind that interesting .
10852,"i hope a woman will be able tom beet the eligibility require , cents in day !"
10853,so do i . do you listen to the radio ?
10854,not that much . did you know that you can hear jupiter 's storms mn th a radio ?
10855,no i did not
10856,there is also a finnish radio station that broadcasts a weekly program in classical latin . i wonder how many people can understand it !
10857,"that is very cool . i canada , all radios are required to have at least 40 percent of the music to be played to be canadian n ."
10858,"i have n't heard that much canadian music , i didnt know there was that much . would you listen to a website with thousands of classic radio dramas ?"
10859,"i know avril lavigne came from canada and her music eas played there . no i would not listen to a website with classic radio dramas . i is free , which is neat ."
10860,i 'd love to learn how to make a foxhole radio
10861,how do you do that ? i have never shark of a foxhole radio . since 1989 a finnish radio station has broadcasted a weekly news program convicted in classical latin .
10862,i am not sure but soldiers in wwii used to make them with a razorblade and pencil .
10863,that is cool . do you know that new orleans saints cheerleaders are n't allowed to eat in the same resturant as an nfl payer ?
10864,"yeah , and not only that , but i heard that if the cheerleaders are already eating there and the players come in , , that the cheerleaders have to leave ."
10865,i find that ridiculous . cheerleaders have very low wages to begin the which is unfair . thanks fo chatting with me !
10866,"yeah , i wonder how they can get away with that . nice chatting with you ."
10867,"hello , do you watch he nfl ?"
10868,hello ! yes big an her ! how about you ?
10869,i love the nfl as well . did you know they have no written rule against females playing ?
10870,i would like to see a girl play . eb nice . the university of iowa painted their visitors locker rooms pink . must have been o mess with the other team .
10871,taht would be cool . i wonder if the pink locker room actually affected the tea mat all ?
10872,i doubt it . lol in the 1960 's someone would have been better off to be a top bowler rather than a top football star of hte day because bowlers made twice as much money as the footballers did .
10873,wow that 's pretty amazing . i would have ever guessed that . i be bowlers o n't make a whole lot these days .
10874,"i bet nowhere near as much as he players . however , the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are more than the earnings of an average football player ."
10875,that 's interesting . i guess because nfl careers are usually pretty short .
10876,thati would be ny guesses . do you know that the highest score over was for a college football team e ?
10877,i saw it was 2220 . that is just insane !
10878,talk about a blowout ! i was surprised o find out that there is actualy only 11 minutes of live gameplay per an average nfl game . i thought it would have been a little more than that .
10879,i ca n't believe it 's only 21 minutes of gameplay . i would have never guessed that . must be all of the huddles and play calling .
10880,ye sand tv timeouts . lol how about abba benjarvus greenellis . the former patriots running back never fumbled the ball once in his nfl career .
10881,that 's pretty amazing to never fumble your entire career .
10882,i know . i wonder how many carries he had ? did you know that espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line you see while watching games ?
10883,i have no idea . do you listen to teh radio ?
10884,i love listening to the radio ! how about you ?
10885,i do too . especially in my commute into work . did you know jupiter has radio storms so strong they can be heard on earth ?
10886,same here . i actually like to a lot of sports talk radio . i did n't know that about jupiter . how cool is that ?
10887,. was good talkin do you !
10888,"hey there , do you listen to the radio ?"
10889,"actually , no , i do n't listen very often anymore . i think i got burned off way all the advertisements . still , the way it works is fascinating is how it 's transformed in its original form"
10890,yeah for sure . you can even catch jupiter 's storm in the am .
10891,i guess it 's a large plans tha scan still reach mush are on earth . there are websites now that let you listen to classic radio dramas .
10892,that is so nice and it is free . do you know much latin ?
10893,"most consider it a dead language , but apparently in finland , some still snow it enough for there to be a news program in classical latin"
10894,i really wonder how many listeners they have considering latin is a real language .
10895,"i know a school tthat still teaches it , so maybe not as dead as we are told . inc canada , at ; least 40 percent of the music you 'll hear is canadian since it 's a law there"
10896,that is one way to support local and national artists . in th earlier times soldiers used to a radios using razorblades and pencils ; s
10897,"i wonder what kind of information they could pick up . the radio definitely is n't as popular as t used to be . back in the day , people would use it to listen to sports events ike that of the mlb and nfl"
10898,"yeah , i would like to know that too . do you watch football now on tv ?"
10899,i typically only watch a handful of playoff games and the super bow up what 's cool is how they se embedded chips in the shoulder pads and footballs to track speed and all that . it males sense
10900,"yeah they might be able to use that info fo to many things . at the end do it , in a game of nfl the game time is only 11 minutes ."
10901,"which is n't very long gwen you thin about it . some people make a big deal about how much money they make , but the average engineer wil learn more un a lifetime"
10902,"yeah , i heard a player teaches in the off season to cakes ends meet ."
10903,"wow . k guest he season only lasts 17 weeks of games . apart from training , they have a lot of time off"
10904,and sometimes they have strange rules . new orleans cheerleaders can not eat in the same restaurant as the nfl players .
10905,"maybe the wives requested that one . usually the rules exist due to prior problems . there 's no rule against women playing , but i 'm not sure if any have tried"
10906,"yeah i wonder about tha 40 at least f they went , they can try for it"
10907,sounds like a risk of injury . the playoffs in the nfl are much quicker than thagt of the mlb since it 's singled elimination
10908,that is true . it was nice chatting with you .
10909,do you like football ?
10910,i do . snoop dog once wrote a song for his sons ' team
10911,nice . u of iowa painted teh visitor locker room pink
10912,i wonder if that i suppose to have some effect on them
10913,me too . bowlers made more than football players in the 60s
10914,wow . coaches of football are really well paid nowadays though
10915,yeah tru ep do ou know the highest score n college football ?
10916,"i ahve no idea , have not heard of that"
10917,it is 2220 when cumbelradn lost to georgia tech in 1916
10918,wow what a score . a stadium in texas can sit 18 000 people
10919,"wow that ia huge , how much did that cost ?"
10920,it fads about 60 million and it is for a high school
10921,wow . did you now women can play in the nfl ?
10922,did not know that but heard they are using tracking chips on the players now
10923,yes if they meet the requirements they can play . they are ?
10924,yes they are tracking velocity and speed and such
10925,nice i wonder if htey can use that to make th regime safer
10926,"good point . did you know most patricia used to b , rocket scientist ?"
10927,wow that is such ah huge career jump
10928,indeed it is . nice chat today
10929,same here
10930,"i wonder i fate athletes wouldnt ' tbhavwe already had their own king sized mattresses before being gifted team , haah ."
10931,can you ever really have too many though ?
10932,then again i guess maybe the coach is wealthy enough to afford fancier mattresses since his team is performing so well .
10933,"his is true . we might find out on the next ' redskins talk ' podcast . good dudes , free beer and king size mattresses after days ."
10934,is that a podcast operated by players on the team ?
10935,it sure is . it 's on sirius nfl radio . it 's where w scan hear about adrian peterson 's 96 yards against the cards on sunday .
10936,"oh , taht ' interesting , i typically like listening i radio dramas myself which is lucky for me because there are websites where you can listen to tons of episodes of them ron free ."
10937,"you make a good point . i didnt ' know until today that bill murray was the voice of the human torch on the fantastic four radio show . aw jeez , a n't radio great ."
10938,"i did n't know that either . radio is great , and also so mysterious ! i never realized that planets like jupiter have strong radio storms happening on them that you can actually listen to through an am radio ."
10939,thats actually pretty scroll . seriously . i think they should put more nfl games on the radio . i huge be a good chance to listen unto teh patriots getting crushed on .
10940,the fact that your an even make your own radio using simple items like razor blades and pencils would also make that a dream situation for a football fan who is handy with electronics !
10941,that would be pretty great . i would build my own radios at to listen to that song that snoop dogg wrote for his son 's high school football team
10942,"wow , i never heard about that ! taht sounds like a lot more fun than just having you1 locker room painted pink like the university of iowa had"
10943,"at was it ' a . . . . okay , okay , pink is pretty ad , but the high school stadium in allen , texas cost 60 mil . that would buy a lot of pink paint ."
10944,it 's amazing that for the much they put into th locker room football players mad much less than say engineers for example !
10945,"ha ! that 's true . but coaches make dunk . the way , navy and air force football coaches are the highest paid people in the department of defense ."
10946,wild that 's good for the ! even the people at espn wo design graphics like the yellow first down line have won emmys so they probably are paid a lot too
10947,"that 's a good point . it 's too bad ' redskins talk ' podcast ca n't win an emmy . ah well , at least they gave one to rick and morty ."
10948,i guess for football players it 's the superbowls that feels like their own emmy
10949,this is true . hopefully it will be the redskin turn at the big game this year .
10950,i guess e 'll see after the regular season is don had they all play in the playoffs !
10951,do you1 hatch footbal ?
10952,from time to time . how about you ?
10953,"i used to watch it a lot more , but ap ; aparently the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of gameplay ."
10954,"come to think about it , that is so strange , there is so much in between . and the game has advanced so much . now the players carry chips in their padding"
10955,"yeah , whe i watch it , it seems like i 'm just watching people stand around all day ."
10956,so much down time . there is an astronaut turner coach that serves in one of the teams
10957,"interesting , i wonder what hes studied in school ."
10958,rpi . have you heard about the curiosity surrounding that school ?
10959,no i have n't . what is that abou ?
10960,"they have fight song that includes a sin , cosine and a stagnant and six digits of pi"
10961,interesting . did you know that jupiter storms can be heard on the radio ?
10962,yeah on the am . maybe i should switch from time to time to see if i can catch it
10963,"me too , but i 'm not sure what station ."
10964,me either . there wa sa song by hanson that became the most played in a chicago radio because the djs would not reveal the band
10965,i won if he is canadian ?
10966,i am not sure actually . in 1948 bing crosby filled something like more the half of the radio time allocated to recorded music
10967,"i like bing crosby , do you listen to him much ?"
10968,notre really wh ave you heard of bill murray ?
10969,"yeah , he 's a great actor . i really like his movies ."
10970,he was the voice of human torch in fantastic four in 1930s in radio
10971,interesting . i saw him in groundhog dat .
10972,"the nfl is a professional american football league insisting of 32 teams , divided equally between the nfc and afc"
10973,"hi , ho ware you ? are you a football fan ? do you hollow thur nfl ? which of the 32 teams do you like ?"
10974,chicago is my favourite team . what about you
10975,"i usually look for the underdog in the superbowl . : , did you know that there 's only 11 minutes of live gameplay in an nfl game ? that 's a grea salary on a perminute basis ."
10976,"new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl players , the cheerleader are required to leave ."
10977,i guess that to prevent relationships between players and cheerleaders . they must have ad problems in the past .
10978,"the players want to focus on the game , i think at he good rules ."
10979,"true . speaking of women , i wonder when women will play in the nfl . there 's no rule against it ."
10980,"now , radio is a rbg only ew peoples . you listen to radio ?"
10981,"9 use it listen to the radio when i was a kid . now i se the internet , which is much more convenient ."
10982,jupiter has radio storms so strong stat hey can be picked up and heard by an am radio .

10986,there different variations of football are known as football codes .
10987,i do n't know the rules for the other forms of footbal be seems to be a universal sport . i wonder if any of those teams paints their visiting teams ' locker room pink .
10988,its the most lovable sports by many people . its has so much fans .
10989,are you going to watch hte super bowl this weekend ? which of the teams is your favorite ?
10990,"yes , yellow line representing the first down line for american football games ."
10991,espn won an award for that theatre in the televised games ! it makes it easier or viewers to understand the game .
10992,there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free .
10993,i wounded what generation listens to those programs . youngsters do n't want to hear those shows .
10994,hearing nd thinking are the most two important event in brain . it makes brain activity .
10995,"well , it ' x been fun chatting !"
10996,"yes , have a great day ."
10997,bye !

11001,"i play fantasy , which is partially gambling , and i bet on the super bowl . who would have bet the highest score for a football game wa georgia tech defeating cumberland 2220 ?"
11002,"that was a blow out . i figure that gt had something to prove to cumberland . i dont know what , but they proved it ."
11003,"lots of fumbles , interceptions s , et ."
11004,that must have been a lot of fun for the teams . hood experience . a learning experience for everyone involved . i envy the
11005,"probably sad for cumberland lol , but yea they can learn from it"
11006,hey can learn that football is not their sport .
11007,"lol bet , i didnt realize the average nfl game ha only 11 minutes of actual gameplay"
11008,teh player sunions has ensure hat work time i minimal . teh fans are steamed about it but that an they do ' put in other players ?
11009,"i dunno , to be honest , i dont know that players would than much more than 11 minutes of high speed contact ."
11010,"with the chips in their pads , we can minor them until it is too much , then put in otehr players . technology al , cows us to maximize gameplay ."
11011,yu . also makes for good explanations on tv
11012,"yes , i figure that the fans deserve to know the exact time and place that each concussion happens . they paid a lot of money to teh data should be the ."
11013,"for medical reasons , too . and to show the speed of athletes ."
11014,i guess the athletes are in danger on the field . they should be protected . i think that genetic engineering is a good way to build stronger players . that nfl should start an engineering firm to build the better player .
11015,be ready for the first sub 4 . 0 . 80yard dash
11016,"that is just a matter of time and engineering . i know that we will have the first superspritner in the world . anyway , great chat ! keep on running !"
11017,imagine a 250 pound guy running 4 second 40 . kinda scary .

11023,hi ! i 'm in se ohio . i do too . do you follow the eagles at all ?
11024,i know about the eagles . my brother does n't live to far from there . . . he 's in lancaster . i do n't know about that qb carson wentz though . . . guy ca n't stay healthy .
11025,thats true . always getting hurt . i 'm more appalachian then columns . could you imagine a football shore of 220 now ? that would be impossible !
11026,"lol . . . . not playing against the browns it would n't for the ago 20 years . that 's an awful , lot of football scoring ! what city you live in ?"
11027,i remember how is lebron james was when he came home to clevelands . wwe thouhg he wa going to make cleveland big . around cambridge .
11028,"ohh , heck . my brother used to live in coshocton . . . you 're not far from a t all . yes , lebron was huge ! and we were big for a year at least . not really caring or the national football league and weir refs this year . . . i feel like the super bowl was rigged in the teams get got ."
11029,i agree . seems really strange . do you remember when they started using those yellow lines on the tv for football ? espn won an emmy for that !
11030,no kidding ? i never knew it won an emmy . fun makes it easier seeing the first down though .
11031,"it does . i have family cuyahoga falls . , green ellis has never fumbled a ball !"
11032,i think you just fixed him . . . lol . cuy6ahogq falls is n't a bad town . i 'm thinking on moving there . and i might listen to the super bowl on hte radio if i ca n't get my tv to work .
11033,"that a good idea . there is a lot of train traffic though , so you may have to turn the radio or tv up a bit ! would you watch a female nfl league ?"
11034,"perhaps ? football i think is rough for anyone to be playing . though , i 've known some women in my life that coul definitely play ."
11035,": , an nfl game only has 11 minutes of live play . i think women could do it ."
11036,"yes , i 've heard about that only 11 minutes of gameplay hating . cord . . . it usually takes me a puck o beer to watch all 11 minutes of live football !"
11037,i figure it takes that for a lot of people ! do you think your radio will word kin cuyahogaf calls ? radio waves will have o go thru a lo of metal around there .
11038,"i did n't realize cuyahoga falls had that bad o a problem . , my radio would probably pick up cleveland stations . hey ! i 'm glad we had this talk ! have a really great day !"
11039,you 5o ! its even a pleasure !
11040,"welp , back to the frigid weather . the radio said it 's going down o 4 tomorrow"
11041,i know it . i 'm already dressed in layers for today !
11042,good evening ! planning to watch any football thai weekend ?
11043,"hello , unfortunately i dont watch football , but there are some interesting facts here . snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son ; s high school football team ."
11044,i didn ? . know that . i bet the only was probably half as long as the live gameplay in an nfl game . for a four hour game there are like 11 minutes of actual gameplay !
11045,"yeah thats ridiculous ha . the high school football stadium in allen , texas seats 18 , 000 and cost 60 million to build"
11046,high school football in texas is a whole different thing . it is still a tough profession for those that make it . engineers make more in a lifetime than an nfl player .
11047,yeah remember that movie varsity blues ? football is pretty serious here . 14 of the world ; s 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams .
11048,"wow ! just think in the 1960s , top bowlers , yes , b bowlers ! , made twice as much of the top football players of that era ."
11049,hand crazy since football players put themselves at risk everytime they play !
11050,"that 's true . sadly , maryland 's jordan onair died of heatstroke in june , so there are real risk s ."
11051,"those humungous american flags at football stadiums weigh 1 , 100 pounds and cost 50 , 00 'to make"
11052,spared no expense i guessed . they will be rolling out those falls this weekend as the playoff are starting with the final field o fix teams in each conference decided it week .
11053,who is in the playoff s ?
11054,"the american football conference has kansas city , new england , la chargers , indianapolis , houston , adn baltimore ."
11055,"nice , who is your team ? or who are you rooting for"
11056,"i have a soft spot for the patriots , but would liek to see either kansas city or the charger in it . by the way , in the national footbal conference it is new orleans , al rams , chicago , philadelphia , seattle , and dallas ."
11057,"nfl used tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
11058,"funny how they invest do much , but then at team like new orleans goes even further and forbids players and cheerleaders from eating at the same restaurant . sadly , if the cheerleader is there first and a layer comes in , the cheerleaders has to leave !"
11059,haha thats ridiculous ! cheerleaders also dont get paid for travel ; expenses . i knew someone who was a cheerleader for the lakers
11060,that 's really cool . did she hav new lot of stories ?
11061,"not really , s he wasnt allowed to interact with the players at a . plus , it was just er side job ."
11062,i bet she is the best seat in the house for home games . great chat !
11063,are you a fan of th nfl ?
11064,i am a fan of the nfl ! what about you ?
11065,"me too , nad college football 12 do you have a favorite team"

11067,"i have heard of them , they are my favorite team . i like the pink look to it , what do you think of it ?"
11068,i wonder if it is a mental thing to throw off the opponents ?
11069,"it is , it is basically psycho ; oy 101 . pink has a natural calming effect and relates the players lol"
11070,interesting . do you know how much bowler same in the 1960s ?
11071,"i do n't know exactly , but i know it wa almost double the nfl salary , which is crazy to think about"
11072,i know ! i guess bowling was more popular back in the day .
11073,i think so too . bowling is fun but i ca n't wait tit like football . do you listen to the radio much ?
11074,"yes , i love the radio . what about you ?"
11075,"me too , nothing like cruising go work listening tos ome rock on the radio , what do you listen to ?"

11077,"i heard that , i wonder how that works m i know it is am bum how do you know that it sounds like lol"
11078,i am not sure . i am assuming it busts rounds like static .
11079,"good point , lol . i wonder if it a slightly diferent static sound . in and to youtube that one ! have you heard of foxhole radios ?"
11080,is that from soldiers in wwii ?
11081,"yep , they made them with razor blades and a pencil , i wonder how they made it work"
11082,that is so fascinating . hes i have no idea how that trend into a radio .
11083,"me neither , straight engineering lo , . it was so nice chatting with you ! enjoy your night !"
11084,are you a fan of football ?
11085,i love football . i am a steelers fan . how about you ?
11086,my team is the redskins to e honest .
11087,did you know the highest score ever in a football game was 2220 0 .
11088,no i did n't . do you know what team it was ?
11089,yeah it was georgia tech vs cumberland . georgia tech stopped them on that ray in 1916 .
11090,hilarious . i did n't even know georgia tech was around ac then . go figure .
11091,well in the 1960s football players made a lo less money . in fact to bowlers actually made more money .
11092,interesting . have you seen that movie kingpin with bill murray ?
11093,i dont think i have saw taht one . is it good ?
11094,wel it lisa bout bowlers in the 60s and how they are semi celebrities .
11095,i might have to check thet one out . did you hear about espn winning the award for 'the yellow line that shows first down marker ?
11096,"i did , i wonder if they won awards for the thing that follows the hockey puck in hockey ?"
11097,i dont watch hockey so im not even sure what your talking about to be honest with you .
11098,"lol , no worries . do ou listen yo the radio ?"
11099,i was just listening to jupiters radio storms on am audio so night .
11100,"interesting , waht station was it on ?"
11101,i just remember that t was one am radio . i listen to that the i get tired of listening to all the classical radio dramas . there is a website for that ?
11102,interesting . did you kno you can make a radio out of a razorblade and pencil ?
11103,"yeah i would love to try to buy , d one . you know just to see if i can ."
11104,"that would be cool . well , nice chatting with you !"
11105,nice chattin with you ws well . have a great day .
11106,"hey , how you doing here ' ?"
11107,wonderful ho about you
11108,i 'm great t ! have you heard of the sport called football ?
11109,yes ! i live in america and just watched the superb owl ! what about you ?
11110,"sometimes i watch the b . i think it 's funny that n the 60 's bowlers made twice as much as top fooball stars ,"
11111,also find that funny . are you from the us ?
11112,i am . k grew up there . many of my friends are america a are you from the us ?
11113,yes i am . crazy that there are no written rules against female players
11114,"i thinkk hat women would add class to the game . they could be punters , kickers , placed holders . they are a bunch of jobs that women could do !"
11115,female soccer played should be punters .
11116,"or kicker . that would be great ! little girls would dream of becoming football players ! then again , they should probably dream of being engineers . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player ."
11117,i am guessing that is because their career lengths are longer .
11118,"that 's true . plus you got ta be real smart , and i am certainly not that . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . that 's pretty good pay on a per minute basis ."
11119,haha radios i canada are requires 40 percent of music played to be canadian .
11120,canadians want equality ! they wan to make sure that the own artists it airplay .
11121,seriously ! guess it is . the worst idea .
11122,i think the storms on jupiter probably sound better than most of the top 40 on he radio these days .
11123,id definitely agree with that . crazy that radio can pick up fees storms in jupiter .
11124,"there are many crazy things on the radio these days , a finnish radio station has broadcast 'nuntii latini ' a weekly news program conducted entirely in classical alvin"
11125,that is fascinating .
11126,"i know ! is n't it ? anyhows , nice chatting with youse !"
11127,you a swell !
11128,oh yeah .
11129,hey here do you like watching football
11130,hi ! i love watching football . my favorite team is the green bay packers . how about you ?
11131,"oh i love the patriots , i love watching hte grades but its sad but true there only 11 mins of gameplay on average in the whole game"
11132,that 's crazy once you think about it ! that games last for about 3 hours nd thee only plus for 3 . makes me wonder how in shape they truly are then lol
11133,"haha good question ! , what are your thoughts on the chips that the nfl uses to track players ?"
11134,"i never knew about that until noe and i co n't like is ! there 's already replay allowed , i do n't even every player tracked to tell me more info . what td you in of it ?"
11135,"ya it is scary , its good for stats because it shows velocity and rotation and stuff , i just want to keep it on the field ya know"
11136,very true ! what do ou twin about the highest scoring gram eas coming from college ? crazy high too !
11137,ya that score is insane ! 2220 cumberland must have felt horrible
11138,i 'm surprised georgia tech even kept trying . . . a tthat point 9 think you 'd give pity . do you prefer to watch games on tv or listen to them on the radio ?
11139,"well i like to watch games , i dont use the radio much h , do yoy ?"
11140,i prefer to watch the games . its ' difficult when they 're making about players numbers and position on the field to envision it allan t once .
11141,"right i agree with you , good thing gps created the yellow line , it makes it easier to follow th games on tv"
11142,i love the yellow line ! what do you thin about ' football ' in other countries . . . aka soccer or rugby ?
11143,"well i do n't like it myself , i like football , but yes i 'm glad espn won a emmy for that !"
11144,"i enjoy watching soccer during the world cup or in olympics , but that 's about it . funny what an emmy cant e won for !"
11145,"thats true , do you very watch bowling on t v ?"
11146,"no , i 'm not a fan of watching bowling , but i do enjoy going bowling at times . what do you think bout the saints cheerleaders having to leave ar estauratn if a player comes in ?"
11147,"ya i think thats really dumb and outdated , i 'm shocked they do n't sue or something over that , everyone is so sue happy these days"
11148,"yes . it 's bad enough that they ca n't be . the same restaurant , but to have to leave when 'you were there first . . . barbaric !"
11149,"i agree with you o tthat , they should use the radio o warn each other where they will be at all mimes haha"
11150,"hi , how are you ? do you listen to the radio ?"
11151,"hey there i do listen to the radio sometimes , i didn ; t know that you could create a radio out of a razor blade in a pencil though , did you know that ?"
11152,id id not know that . i wonder the good that radio i though . what scan it pick up ?
11153,yes i have no idea how it works . but i do know tat they used it in world war ii
11154,that is quite inventive in any case . i dont listen to radio much now . i did when i was younger .
11155,yes i agree . i mostly just listen o youtube the i 'm in the car . do you ever listen to canadian radio by the way ?
11156,i have listened to canadian radio . it is mostly like american radio .
11157,the one going that is different is that it is required to have 40 percent canadian content k so tat mans that 40 percent of the radio time is made up of canadia artists
11158,"yeah , i remember hearing a lot of us , neil young , loverboy . that makes sense ."
11159,yeah and there 's probably some justin bieber being played too hahha . would you ever listen to a jupiter radio storm on your radio by the way ?
11160,i cant imagine listening to a storm on jupiter . maybe the solar activity on the sun ?
11161,yeah tha tight be interesting l it also might tube interesting to listen to a new station that is red in classical latin excuse i would not understand any of it lol
11162,"how amy people actually listen to broadcast , i wonder . it is an odd taste , that for sure ."
11163,"does i wonder how many people can understand classical latin these days , and apparently there is a nice radio station that will play thousands of episodes of radio drama , and they are completely 've , i wonder if they are any good"
11164,i would rather listen to those old radio shows . they sound more inte4eestign . i dont think the kids are interested though .
11165,"no i think you 're right unfortunately . on a separate note though , do you ever listen to football on the radio ? apparently women are allowed to play for the nfl if they are good enough"
11166,i dont listen to football on the radio . i used to listen to baseball on the radio . women in the nfl ? i wonder if that will ever happen .
11167,"yeah u do n't know . but i also do n't kno whoo an average nfl game only has about 10 minutes of live gameplay , especially since it seems to take hours to watch on tv lol"
11168,"yeah , the spectacle draws a lot of interest , but really it is short lied . i just watched he highlights . that is enough . anyway , great chat !"
11169,"ye great chat . and next time you 're watching again look ut for the tracking chips theft he nfl puts in the player shoulder pads , they can tell all kinds of stats just from how those chips are moving like velocity and rotation !"
11170,thats true ! have a god nigh t !
11171,"thank you you too ! ad keep in mind that the nfl was created 1920 , it 's so long gags so that probably explains their crazy rules"
11172,are you a football fan ?
11173,sure ! i like the nfl . do about you ?
11174,i like it . i wonder if we 'll ever see a woman play in it .
11175,"yeah , that would be cool . though , i ca n't blame womens or not wanting to be a par tofu a notoriously sexist industry ."
11176,there 's no written rule that says they ca n't play . maybe we could se . woman kicker one day .
11177,"yeah , i 've read that somewhere . i get do n't think women would necessarily want to be a part of the industry . it does n't seem like a comfortable working environment . do you have a favorite nfl team ?"
11178,i 'm a redskins fan . what about you ?
11179,il ike the cowboys . did you know the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 ?
11180,i remember hearing that . they were probably paid in ; pennies . bowlers used to make more money than hem .
11181,"that 's crazy . coaches are paid really well , too ."
11182,do you ever listen to games on the radio ?
11183,sometimes . but i do love the radio . i'ts kind of nostalgic .
11184,yeah . did you know that soldiers used to make radio out of razorblades as pencils ?
11185,"yeah , they called them foxhole radios . i wonder why they could pic up on them ."
11186,who knows . maybe jupiter . jupiter has storms so big that you can hear them on am radio .
11187,"that 's pretty cool . or more likely , bing crosby . evidently , they estimate that bing roster recordings filled love half the radio time allocated for music ink 1948 ."
11188,"wow , that 's crazy ; . in canada , 40 percent of the music you play has to be from canadian artists ."
11189,that ' slavery patriotic of them . did you know team 's a radio station that translates oar activity ?
11190,i did not . i 've heard about a radio station in finland that is conducted entirely in latin .
11191,"that 's cool . but yeah , not only does the radio station translates the sun , you can listen to the un 's music . i wonder what it sounds like . well , it 's been nice chatting with you !"
11192,i wonder the same thing . the car .
11193,"halo , do you like football ?"
11194,"hi . it ' sport my favorite thing in the world , but i am surprised that there is a rocket scinetistr who coaches ."
11195,hello . did you know iowa painted the opposing team locker room pink ?
11196,"i did . that 's hilarious , and it must have been an intimidation tactic . i wonder if gt had theirs painted pink during that 2220 win overs cumberland ?"
11197,lol . taht 's such a crazy score for a football game .
11198,i it . did you know that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for hid son 's school ' ? i wonder if it is rapped .
11199,i did not knw that a greenellis a never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
11200,"that 's amazing . i 'm more than a little annoyed to realize that teh highest paid employees in the department tofu defense , are football coaches . that seems to be thought ."
11201,i think so too . do you listen to the radio ?
11202,"i do . i 'm trying to find that station that translates solar you , so you can listen to the music of the un ."
11203,that would be very cool . i heard you can hear jupiter storms on earth .
11204,i would like to hear those too . i did n't know bill murray voiced a radio show in the 70 's .
11205,"that 's funny i did n't know that either . in canada , it 's a law for all radio stations to play at last 40 percent of canadian music ."
11206,"are there even that many nadia artists ? i can not believe that there are people who do n't know who hanson is , and that the dj in chicago was about to get away with playing it on an alternative station ."
11207,i have no idea lol . soldiers in wwii made simple radios using g razorblade and pencil as the diode .
11208,"my grandfather showed me how to do that . i guess bing crosby was very popular in 1948 , he dominated the airplay ."
11209,that 's interesting . do you like the nfl ?
11210,it 's okay . i hear ther dis a coach who used to be a rocket scientist .
11211,i have heard taht too . wonder if he made the embedded chips to track players ?
11212,"maybe ? or the ones in the footballs ? i think he was an aeronautical engineer , that would make sense if he was involved ."
11213,"i think it 's in their pads da anyway , it was great talking to you !"
11214,o do you know much about football ?
11215,"i know its a league consisting of 32 teams . : , i watch some , grew up with it in the house ."
11216,"i do n't know too ca , i do know that iowa 's visitor 's locker is painted pink !"
11217,"that 's crazy . omen players are allowed , there 's no written rule against them ."
11218,really ? i didn ; t know that ! good thing !
11219,"an average game only has 1 actual . minutes of gameplay ! those games take hours , i ca n't belive how little of it is actually athletic ."
11220,"wow ! they seem so much longer . the players seem to make a lo so money , bu tower a lifetime , engineers will , make more ."
11221,no way ! that 's one of those crazy hard to believe facts . like that new orleans saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a player comes in to eat while they are there .
11222,hat ? taht ' insane ? n't there are no rules agains them playing ?
11223,"i 've heard it from sa reliable resource : , they still have to meet eligibility requirements , just like the new have to ."
11224,funny . i heard that the highest score in a game was 2220 . must ave been a great game to watch !
11225,only if you were in te winning side . imagine how awful the losing team felt .
11226,"ha ! i know , it 's tube horrible to live with that for the rest of your life ! !"
11227,"well at least it happened in 1916 , no one herd about it like they would in today 's world ."
11228,"very true ! speaking of a while ago , you know that top bowlers made 2x more than top football player in the 60 's ?"
11229,bowlers were definitely top tier in the 60 's . how funny is that ?
11230,"i know , but you think o flow much footbal players make now , its crazy !"
11231,all professional athletes are paid a lot . like a ridiculous amount really . it 's crazy to think about .
11232,i know that 's why i was happy to see that engineers make mork rover a lifetime . even though many professions should .
11233,tha ties definitely true . my ex is an engineer and he pulls in bank .
11234,i guess a lot comes wit being a football player . the nfl actually uses tracking chips to record their movements on the filed .
11235,that 's nuts . nice chatting with you !
11236,do you like football ?
11237,i do . u of iowa painted the visitor blocked room pink
11238,i wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on the
11239,i wonder too . bowlers made more than them in the 60s too
11240,yeah . do you know the highest score in college football ?
11241,yes it was 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
11242,yeah and that was back in 1916

11244,a that was fo the superimposed yellow line
11245,"i am glad they did taht , it has made game watching easier"
11246,true . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
11247,yes the guy that never fumbled the ball . do you wathc tv ?
11248,yes i do . do you like the simpsons ?
11249,i sure do . there is an episode where bart does not appear
11250,yes and he is at even mentioned in it
11251,"yeah , . how about that 70s show ?"
11252,i liked it but it really flopped in the uk
11253,yes after just 10 episode because it was remade verbatim
11254,yeah . did you ever see pokemon ?
11255,yes i have seen only some of the 5 episodes that are out there
11256,yeah that is a lot . nice chat today
11257,same here
11258,"hi , how are you ? are you following the colin kaepernick or eric reid drama ?"
11259,"reid , 26 year old pick out of law , played some linebacker out of necessity in 2017"
11260,"yes eh did . he is in the middle of a lawsuit against the nfl for collusion . since he is a top safety , i think he has a good one . . ."
11261,"hd tweet ' people who know football know who can play . people who know me , know my character r ' ."
11262,"yeah , he really talented ad should n't have been out o the league at all . for as simple protest not to be african americans st a disproportional rate compared to whites ."
11263,"football is a family of team sports that ibvovle , btw e become one antione to achieve for the nation ."
11264,"although some find him cowards , i find kaepernick extremely brave forgo giving up football to take a stand agains police killing his people . that are your thoughts ."
11265,he is best player but the football missed him very much .
11266,"yea . i get sad when people bang on him but i find him strong and abe to start the movement . i find more white people unwilling to learn about him and the movement , which makes it tough o argue with them . . ."
11267,television sometimes shortened duo tele is a great communication medium .
11268,"yes , it is . is there a favorite communication meseum that you like ? ;"
11269,very much . television is a mass medium for advertising .
11270,that 's interesting . i really like to watch sports on tv . do you ?
11271,for watching football only i buy the tv . what your favourite team ?
11272,i am from chicago and moe thee ears . what about you ?
11273,i move to atlanta . you played tennis ?
11274,"sorry , love the chicago bears . i do enjoy tennis . you ? are you watching hte australian open on ty ?"
11275,some time i watch it . wimbledon is my favourite tournament .
11276,nice . . . i want to eventually go and watch that tournament . i think it would be fun . but i also think i would be soooo hot in the stands . is tennis your favorite sport ?
11277,"yes , its one ma show . strong body and mental required for it ."
11278,sounds good . nice chatting with you .
11279,"i did n't know that there is only 1 episode of ' the simpsons ' where bart neither appears , nor is mentioned"
11280,"will , i much less , i find out . and i see that program , i like it"
11281,"did you know that hte highest score in football game was 2220 , but it was really while ago . it 's surprising fact ."
11282,"yes , i did read something in particular about it , it 's something surprising . they should have played an in the field , that team weighed hte other"
11283,i was always surprised that there isnt ny written rule against female players in nfl . and still do n't understand why women do n't play
11284,"it 's a very strange thing , there re many women incapable fort these types of sports , but goo d ."
11285,"i agree . well , maybe with average nfl lame only 11pm minutes of live gameplay , it 's not interesting for ladies ."
11286,there will come a time when the first will be encouraged and so will the others
11287,did you know that new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating goin thas any restaurant as any nl player
11288,"how curious is that ? well , i have some thought of some because of it , but . what do you think ?"
11289,i think it 's kind of stupid and old style rule . it does n't make any dense .
11290,"well , i suppose it 's because of creating bonds int he middle of all this , its ' not good for players o have their head i something else"
11291,": , it could be true . however , to require to , have a place when nfl palmer comes . . . well , u 'm not sure in tha . , ."
11292,"weak re not sure of anything , they are pure speculations . . . but we must not remove the possibility"
11293,true . did you know that locker room for visiting team in the university of iowa is completely painted pink ?
11294,"or yes , yes . . . so today something about this , it is rumored that it is for the visiting team to know that they are better and they feels less"
11295,"some people may call it as sort of pressure , out i 'm not sure ."
11296,"to me that could cause m , er father desire to coder their mouths and beat them for leary nob ut hey , all this is part of the show"
11297,i agree . nfl is all abou performance !
11298,"well of course . what is worth there is the best performance , th better the teams , teh better the matches"
11299,yes ! my pleasure to talk with you . have a good day !
11300,"also , have a great day"
11301,helo hows it going ? do you like football ? i did n't know women can play in the nfl .
11302,i did n't know that either ! it 's possible they only allow it because they think it very unlikely a woman will make a team .
11303,"yeah , i do n't ever see any play for the nfl though lo maybe they just value their health h , it is scary being a football player they get injured all the time"
11304,"yah , i wonder if they is why they do n't make more than teh average engineer ! their careers tend to be short with all of the injuries"
11305,"it looks like the use to technology has been beneficial to football , they put tracking chips in their players !"
11306,"that is cray to me , the technology that is i nfl games now . i slow they were saying that the last time that jim pants called a dallaswashington game , it was so much less technical . no first down lines , n o facing replays ."
11307,"the replays nowadays are excellent , the free by frame picture and the playback and forward da its amazin . also , the way the announcers can kinda draw on the screen , really tech stuff ."
11308,i ca n't decide if i like th technology o got . it helps make things fair and makes it noce to watch . but it probably slows things down . it was pretty eydopening that an average game only has 11 minutes of actual ive gameplay
11309,"yeah , you are probably right m 11 minutes of the play but the actual event last like 3 hours ! lol"
11310,"yep , though somehow , i still watch and enjoy the games . i can actually remember the season that jim last called that game , because the cowboys beat my team the year when they won the superbowl ! crazy tot think back that far"
11311,in the 1960 d bowlers mate more than football players . i guess a lot of people watched bowling more back then !
11312,"ha ! i can ' level imagine that . it shows how much football has changed in he last 60 years , h ow much skaters earn now versus then"
11313,"i know right , super interesting what was more popular back then ."
11314,"i less i am a pretty casual fan , because i ad never noticed the ' crossflexing ' this before . it is interesting how much they play the ratings numbers now , to get the best games at the best times . i didnt ' know that 80 percent of he country goat waht late afternoon game"
11315,"that is a weird tactic , painting the opposing team locker room pink ? i wonder what that does ?"
11316,"anything to get inside their head , i guess ! i gues it is implying they 're girl ? the thing that stuck ot to me as being the oddest fact was that the saints cheerleaders ca n't beat in the same restaurant as an nfl player ! i wonder what the reason for that is"
11317,"probably they ca n't interact twitch football ppl ; payers because a distraction ? maybe . it 's pretty rude , like wat if they are not more eating ! ?"
11318,"the nfl relaly is kind of a crazy thing , because this country is just so into it . i cna't even believe 'the tv contracts . a billion dollars for the rights to just half of the game isn it ! but they can make money on it because the country is full of such rabid fans"
11319,"true , football is a huge money maker . i kinda do n't understand it though , liked why ts s popular , so many breeds , only 11 min of gameplay , injured all the time , a ton of penalties , switching out players , offense and defense ? c ."
11320,"in a close game , these low pace kind of makes the splash plays that much more exciting . then again the are games like that last cowboysredskin same they mentioned d , where the cowboys just racked up 38 unanswered points . and even it 's that easy for a few , it 's kind of a to watch your team do was like that ."
11321,"true . its good chatting , see ya !"
11322,are you a fan of either the redskins or cowboys ?
11323,well big prefer the redskins personally . bug i do think the cowboys have a good team this year . that do you think ?
11324,"i also like the redskins but the cowboys have a better team , at least thats season ,"
11325,yep i agree . what do you think about the cowboys coach jason barrett ? i think he ? s definitely on the ball right np
11326,"i think he was a great backup for aikman and he is kind a good job , he just needs a better team to get to the superbowl"
11327,"speaking of football , what do you think about the nfl ? who 's your favorite team"
11328,"i love the nfl , my favorite team are the patriots . they are the best tema int he league now"
11329,yes i also love the patriots and i love tom brady ! do you think that the nfl will ever have female players in it though
11330,"i dont thinks o , try seem to be at a disadvantage there , its a game of strength so maybe as a kicker"
11331,"see i could see a kicker , i also could see them putting tracking chips on female players in order to compare the stats to male players"
11332,"i heard the balls also have a tracking chip in them , used to get different interesting stats of th dame"
11333,"yes they can get things like rotation and velocity of the ball which is interesting , i wonder i that 's how they figured out hat there are only about 11 minutes of gameplay n an average nfl game"
11334,"only 1 minutes ? that seems unfair for the public , last superbowl lasted like 3 hours"
11335,yep i agree that 's a lot of commercials lol . dod you watch the super bowl on tv or did you go to the game
11336,"on tv tickets are just too expensive for my budget , great game though , watched it with friends at home , what about you ?"
11337,"guess i watched it on tv . that 's about the only tim when i do watch tv because i mostly watched youtube stuff , i always like to watch south park as well what about you"
11338,"south park was own of my favorite show si also liked the simpsons ,"
11339,did you ever of the episode where south park made fun of family guy ? and then apparently afterwards the simpsons creator sent south park flowers because the show wa soso spoton lol
11340,"i did , that was a funny one l i guess the crew from both hows are friends with each other"
11341,"yes i think so . did you ever watch the show pokemon by the way ? i watched it a lot when i was in middle school , and apparently there are over 800 episodes now . i would never be able to ' catch ' them all"
11342,"i used to the the show , watches the original series with 150 pokemons ,"
11343,"i watch far too much tv , are you a fan of television ?"
11344,"yea , i like watching snl , their longest running skit is weekend update"
11345,i love that skit . are you a fan of the simpsons ?
11346,"yea , il love some . in the first 400 episodes he held 188 jobs !"
11347,wow ! that 's an insane amount of jobs . did you know there is only one episode where art does not appear nad is ot mentioned ?
11348,"no , that 's crazy considering how many episode there are . they recently had daniel radcliffe do a voice neon treehouse o horror xxi"
11349,id id not know that . i missed it . did you see the family buy episode of shout park where they pointed outta hat family guy ripped off the simpsons format ?
11350,"yea , those south parr episodes were un o watch on tv"
11351,i agree . after that episode aired the simpsons crew sent the south park crew flowers ha ha .
11352,nice . have you very watched shark tank ? it turns out most deals on th show are beaver enacted
11353,i am aware of it nad how it works but i 've never seen an episode .
11354,quite deceptive . apparently shakespeare 's the two noble kinsmen has never been adapted for tv or film
11355,i woulda ave thought theyd here all adapted by now . are you aware of the show thomas the tank engine ?
11356,"yea , i 've seen a few episode of he telly as a kid"
11357,"did you know that ringo starr , and baldwin , and george carlin have all narrated for hte show ?"
11358,"no , that 's pretty crazy . did you know the player in football games have tracking chips embedded i nhteijr equipment ?"
11359,i did hear that it as on their person and also on the football . i wonder what they use that data for ?
11360,"i how they use the chips to track the footballs velocity , speed , rotation , and location"
11361,i wonder why they do n't use that data o help mark calls then instead of just relying on reviews ?
11362,the nfl should also use the data from the chips to help with player safety
11363,ia greet i that as well .
11364,"hello , do you lie football ?"
11365,"sure , i 'm a big cowboys fan , personally . ? about you ?"
11366,"i donner really follow football too much , but i watch a once in awhile , i like the 49ers ."
11367,"yeah , i find it hard to avoid after while . considering the regular season runs practically four months , then has several months of postseason , it can get a little ' in your face ' o television ."
11368,"absolutely , sometimes i dont even realize im watching ut , like on thanksgiving or something lol"
11369,"and then finally , the first sunday in february when everything slurs down for the super bowl ."
11370,"yeah , i hear ya lol did you know the nfl uses tracking chips ?"
11371,"yeah , on both the players and the balls ? they want to be able to track everything , i guess ."
11372,yeah i guess stats mean a lot in that sport . its kinda sad that there is only 11 min of game play yet the event probably takes about 3 hours .
11373,that must be one of the many reasons engineers make more money over a lifetime than a football player .
11374,yeah and the injuries ! you hardly hear about an engineer getting injured affecting his caeser .
11375,"haha . yeah , you rarely hear about an engineer only have a fifteen yea career because his body finally gave out on him ."
11376,"right ! maybe they would ge ta strained wrist from being at the computer so much , but usually nothing serious . lol"
11377,"they 're too busy getting paid and amzing the tracking chips that go in football it worry about it . did you know back in the 60s , bowlers actually made more ethan football players ?"
11378,"that is really amazing , real do time to be a bowler !"
11379,definitely . did you know there 's no written rule preventing women prom playing in the nfl ?
11380,"i did , i had no idea before i read it . i wonder why we dont see more women playing football ."
11381,"probably because it 's an incredible sexist industry , and would be a very hostile working environment ."
11382,well theresa re very masculine women who train and build up to play those types of sports . i 've seen them at hte gym . i met a woman who played rugby before !
11383,"oh , definitely ! i 'm not saying women agree n't capable of playing . i 'm saying the league is very unfair toward omen . they look away from the wifebeaing and sexual harassment scandal . in fact , a saints cheerleader has to get p from the restaurant where she is eating if a player walks in ."
11384,"yeah that is very rude . why not come up with an itinerary so cheerleaders known ot to go there instead of the happening where they might have fo leave mid meal , . anyways been great chatting !"
11385,do you like the nfl ?
11386,"i do actually , di do know tha women can pals too ?"
11387,yes there is not rule that prevents them from playing
11388,yes as long as they can get the requirements they are good to play
11389,yeah . did you know there are only 11 minutes of gameplay ?
11390,yesh and yet we are glued to the tv for hours
11391,yeah . did you know engineers make more money though over the lifetime ?
11392,wel they do ahve longer careers too though so that makes sense
11393,yeah they have more time to make money if you think it that way
11394,yeah . did you hear of that yule for saints cheerleaders ?
11395,yes theyd re not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players
11396,"yes and worst , the also have to leave mid meal when they walk in"
11397,haha it is sexist and it needs to go all
11398,i agree . u og iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
11399,wow i wonder if that is supposed to have some impact ton them
11400,i wonder too . bowlers made more money in the 60s that football players
11401,"now i guess it was a much more popular , ar sport back in the day than fooball"
11402,yeah true . do you now what the highest score in college football is ?
11403,yes it is 20 and georgia tech beat cumberland
11404,yeah what a score that must have been even for 1916
11405,yeah that is crazy good . nic chatting with you .
11406,what di you think about eric reid ? you think people are not signing him because he 's bad or because he wo n't stand for the national anthem
11407,i would think that would be a reason why teams werent signing the 2013 firsts round pick out of lsu .
11408,yep i think so . him and colin kaepernick definitely got the shot tend of the straw after they started their activism
11409,yes they did . they first did it before a game in sept . of 201 an have had nothing but problems since then .
11410,yep it 's interesting that he had an 8 . 4 million dollar contract and he essentially threw it away buy refusing to stand
11411,"wow . i did n't know ow much it cost 60 , id o know though that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher compared to that of the lifetime earnings of an average nfl or mlb player ."
11412,"yep you 're right about that . also , average nfl game only last for about 10 minutes of actual gameplay , the rest is just referees and staging around lol"
11413,"lol for tthat short amount of time , they do a good job of dragging it out to 3 hours . did you know there 's no written rule against female players ? i wonder if wells see on at some point . . . maybe a kicker ?"
11414,"that 's what i ' thinking , we could probably see a kicker , i just hope that she can attend a restaurant with other players , unlike cheerleaders , they 're not allowed nad they havent o leave if a fooball player enters the restaurant"
11415,that is the strnagesy rule . what do you think of the tracking chips they are using to record dat pain players shouldve reads end footballs ? seems like the 're are really getting technical .
11416,"i think it 's interesting that they ca trams the stats like rotation and speed , i just hope they can turn the tracking off once the players lave the field"
11417,yes . do you ? what the highest scoring football game ever was ?
11418,yes it was between georgia tech and cumberland right . was n't the score like 222 to 0 our something crazy
11419,holy smokes ! t nat 's a blowout . in hte 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of yacht era . times have changed since then .
11420,yep it ' definitely the reverse these days . did you know that espn on an emmy ? they did it when they created the yellow line it shows first downs on tv broadcast too football games
11421,i did n't know they won one fo that . i love that line . changed the way we watch football . do you watch a lot of television ?
11422,"yes i watch television from time to time , i really like watching pokemon because it reminds me , my childhood , they 're almost 800 episodes now"
11423,"wow . my kids were really into it , and even now they are in their 30s they still love it haha , . did you ever watch that 70s show ?"
11424,yes i used to watch that show a lost . what ti do n't like i stat they try to recreate it in the uk market . it actually flopped over there lol
11425,lol i heard about that . they called it days like these . did you know that in the simpsons there is only 1 episode that bart is n't in and in n't mentioned ?
11426,"that 's what i heard but i never saw that episode , do you think they just forgot about him ? that do you think bout the episode of southpark where they made fun of family guy ? afterwards the simpsons creator sent the south park creators a set of flowers"
11427,do you watch much television ?
11428,i ; movie watching the telly ! do you hve any favorite shows ? i like snl and the simpsons .
11429,"i like south park and family guy . simpsons i like also , but it has been a while . have you seen south park or family guy ?"
11430,"i like both of those ! in the first 400 episodes of the simpsons , homer has held 188 jobs !"
11431,that is so can lol . i always thought he just worked t the power plant
11432,same here ! lol weekend update on snl debuted on the first episode and has been their longest running skit . that has to be very 0 some odd years !
11433,"wow , i never knew that ! crazy . speaking of hte simpsons before , did you know there id only one episode that bart was n't in or even mentioned"
11434,i did n't know that ! did you ever watch shark tank ?
11435,"i used to watch here and there , interesting show or sure . a lot of people get a good shot on there ."
11436,"yes . . , . i was surprised to discover though that most deals made on there are even reacted ."
11437,"really ? i wonder why that is , do you know why ?"
11438,i have no idea . lol i just found ou about it . another interesting tv a is that only one of shakespeare 's plays has not been date for a movie or tv the two noble kinsmen .
11439,"only one ? you would figure there woul do many more , wow ! d id you ever watch pokemon ?"
11440,i beaver really watch it but my kids always had it on . lol

11446,"ish ave ! who has n't ? lol there 's a high schools stadium in allen , texas that seats 18 , 000 and cost 60 million to build . that 's like a baseball stadium . lol"

11470,yes i did . th afc champion patriots won the game
11471,"yup . . . again . . . . i 'm a raven 's fan . tony romo did a nice job . i wonder how jason gotten would have done , but he 's affiliated with espn so i 'm not sure how that would have worked ."
11472,espn adn the blogger mobile are awful ! tey lost their sports broadcasting background awhile ago . now its just social media and advertising
11473,"yup , u used to watch sports center religiously , now i might put it on once or twice a year . they really focus on the net l , and would really be interested if they ever got a female player . after all , there is no written rule against i t ."
11474,would she feel did if she got drafted by the saints . where the players and cheerleaders are not allowed to eat at the same place ?
11475,"yah , that would be awkward . she would walk in an the cheerleaders would have to leave ."
11476,jason hitter was a very good player but still needs some work in the boot . maybe he can win espn another emmy
11477,"maybe some day . i liked him during his 15 year career , and drafted him on my fantasy football team several times ."
11478,hes is second in rec and yards as a te . thats good fantasy production
11479,for sure . he can dem bryant back in the day made quite the pza84 . plus catching balls from troy aikman was n't too shabby either .
11480,gift he average nfl game only has 11 mins of live gameplay . i wonder how much time written was actually used
11481,goo dont . i still like watching it in tv though . never seen any of the over 750 episodes of pokemon though .
11482,thats 16 years worth ! i dont think i would eb able to stand the ads
11483,i do n't i 'd be able to stand the show . 50 a year ? i could n't even get through one i bet .
11484,what about trying to find the 1 episode of the simpsons where bart is neither mentioned or appears
11485,at ; east i used to like that show . have n't seen it in years though . i tend to se tv as a mass medium for news . even though you nee to take it in with a healthy bit of skepticism .
11486,i feel like if djt wasnt for news or sports t wouldnt survive
11487,probably no the most of the show are crap now a days .
11488,yeah a show called ' days like these ' only lasted 10 episods in he uk
11489,"yes , i heard that somewhere before . well , it 's bee nice chatting with you ."
11490,have a good day !
11491,"hello there , are you an nba fan ?"
11492,"hey there , ya i love the patriots , what about you ?"
11493,oh wow the you have been quite spoiled the last decade or so 2
11494,"haha i have ! but not spoiled in once sense , nfl games only have about 11 minutes of gameplay haha"
11495,that is crazy when you think about it . i know you notice all the stops much 're when you go to a live game .
11496,"ya that true , i havne't been to a live game in a while , what get did you go to"
11497,oh i hve brent o parker gems before and i just know our time it more when going to the games .
11498,"ah i see , thats crazy is theres no rule against merle players , would you watch females in the nfl ?"
11499,"i think that would be awesome , they shoudl allow girls in all pro sports , it should be the best players possible ."
11500,"yup , if they are te bees the the should be allowed to play i think"
11501,"exactly , and it would give young girls who are sports fans all kinds of hope and motivation ."
11502,"well rely should n't be too enthused about the salary , do you know an engineer will make more tha na pro nfl player ?"
11503,"yeah i read that , i think it is because the average nfl career is not that long vs . an engineer has a lifetime of working ."
11504,"ya tha makes sense , does n't make sense though the rules bout th saints cheerleaders , did you hear about those ?"
11505,"yeah i read about those as well , that seems pretty outdated but who knows ."
11506,"ya , like having to get up and leave if a player walks intro a bar or restaurant , it seems absurd"
11507,"right , it is a public place , as long as they 're not breaking any actual laws that sould b ok ."
11508,what do you think of the chips the nfl uses to track the ball and also players ?
11509,"i think its smart , they need tom and the game as safe as possible , the us to the head are dangerous ."
11510,"that true , i just worry about those chips being used outside the game , that scary stuff"
11511,"that is , well its been nice talking with you , i hope you have a good night ."
11512,do you watch the nfl ?
11513,k sure do . did you now taht women scan play too ?
11514,yes there are no rules that prevent them from playing
11515,"dwight , as long as they qualify for the game they cain play"
11516,yeah . the average gem half is only 11 minutes anyways
11517,exactly and yet we are glued o the tv forever
11518,i know . did you know engineers earn more than the players though
11519,yes i guess their careers are also longer so that makes sense
11520,true . did you hear of that saint cheerleaders rule ?
11521,the one that they are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players ?
11522,yeah and they also have to leave emit meal if they walk in
11523,it is so sexist and it really need to go by now
11524,i agree . they are also in tracking chips on the players now
11525,yes they collect info on velocity and rotation and a bunch of stuff
11526,i hope the can use that to make the game safer too
11527,good point . u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
11528,i wonder if hat is supposed to wave some impact on the players
11529,yeah me too . bowlers made more than football players int he 60s
11530,that blows my mind how things have changed now
11531,exactly . it was nice chatting with you
11532,"some here , take a good one"
11533,"hey how are you , do you watch footabllm such ?"
11534,yes love nfl !
11535,"cool , me too . can you believe bowlers got paid more in the 60s tron did the fans players ?"
11536,that is crazy . id you know espn invented the yellow line ?
11537,"i rid , i think they wonka n emmys for it too did n't they ? who is your favorite team ?"
11538,raidernation here and antonio bron ! ! ! maye we con score 222 points l ; ike georgia tech now .
11539,"haha , score a film ore points than cumberland did . abby to te raiders is pretty cool , he seems like a raider for sure ."
11540,i knew as it friday . a bunch of raider fans who are also warrior fans saw him at the warriors game . he got curry jersey from him !
11541,"that 's cool , it i always nuts to remember tha 'the warriors play in oakland , they seem like 2 very different teams ."
11542,not as of next season . they will be next tot h esp its lol . i et lebron could play in nfl haha . probably note fumble likd benjarvus greenellis !
11543,"lebron would be unstoppable as at e for sure , he 'd never fumble either . what do you mean by the s giants will be close to them ?"
11544,they are moving to a few arena . it is almost done .
11545,"ah i gotcha , the raiders are going to las vegas teh year after next right ?"
11546,"yeah , good thing there is only 11 minutes of actual play . it might be hot there lol ."
11547,it 'll be getting really ho other . do you watch a lot of tv ?
11548,o worries . i did inside . i was kidding . yes i watch tv but i stream more .
11549,"yah , tv channels on stations are kind of rip offs now , you have to pay a ton of money each month and still watch a ton of commercials , not a very good deal . you ever watch any of the 750 episodes that were made of the show pokemon ?"
11550,it will take m 16 years if i watched one a week
11551,"that 's a really long time for sure . i was rather surprised ton ear that there are only two types of tvs still , back add white and colored tv . pretty soon there 'll be vr tv lol ."
11552,i can watch netflix already wath my vr headset ! i want to find that uk knock wolf of the 70 's show lol .
11553,"that woudl be pretty cool , what if we 're already in vr now though ? kind of freaky . i 'm going to go for a wal though , it was great the hat with you , hope you have a grea best of the day !"
11554,"hi , how are you ?"
11555,"do , how are you ?"
11556,i am well . do you lke fooball ?
11557,yes i do . how about you ? did you watch the superbowl ?
11558,i did . i was rooting for the patriots . who were you rooting for ?
11559,no one i was bust watching i tc hte whole 11 minutes of gameplay
11560,ha ! that 's not a lot of game play . did you know where is no rule against females playing ?
11561,yeah i wonder why they do not play though
11562,maybe because they could make more as an engineer .
11563,haha tha times so true . it 's sad how little players make really . the coaches make a lot though
11564,"yeah , they are usually the highest paid in the same ."
11565,yeah . snoop dog thought rate a song for his son 's football team
11566,really ? iowa 's visiting locker room is pink .
11567,wonder if they is a reason behind that
11568,psychological . i am no sure i works though because bowlers used to make more .
11569,they did for sure . do you know where is he larger high school football stadium in the us ?
11570,"no , where ?"
11571,"in allen , texas"
11572,wow . learn it to texas o put too much money into high school football .
11573,i know . it holds 18000 people and cost 60 million unto build
11574,nice chatting with you !
11575,did you ever watch pokemon ? apparenlty there are over 750 episodes of it
11576,"i rid , and i played pokemon go , d id you play ?"
11577,"i few for a bit yes ! i didnt get a ton of pokemon but i did play adn i liked . , i played the original red and blue versions on gameboy as a kid"
11578,"i likd paying the game , but it got redundant where i live . apparently , a lot of people played it ."
11579,"ya thats true , you have to travel to different places to get different pokemon , and only some pokemon were given away all special event s , and some ar evoked to certain countries , its bust seemed too impossible"
11580,"yeah , i liked the game . i also liked the show was 70s show , apparently they tried to make a uk version ."
11581,"ya i remember that , and it was cancelled after like 10 episodes ! oh well they 're missing out over there"
11582,i did n't know that ringo starr voice drank the engine though .
11583,"wow i did n't know tat , i dd know that george carlin did some voices for hamas thet am , i wish he wold sneak in some jokes then i 'd actually watch that show ahaha"
11584,"apparently the un tvs ave oled , so does the new iphone . i 'm debating whether or not to upgrade ."
11585,"ya i dont ' know , t depends what your current iphone is , i have a pixel xl 2 so i have a great phone i 'm good waiting for a while"
11586,"lol , i still have the iphone 5s , i 've never used a case an dropped it a million times . it wo n't die ."
11587,"haha well that phone is pretty old , man get a new one so you can watch nfl as on it , apparently the average one only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay"
11588,"not surprising , when i watch the games at the bar , it is mostly clock watching ."
11589,"ya , espeically near the end one they 're using timeouts , i ca n't believe in teh 60 's that bowlers made more than top footbal players"
11590,"i can believe it . that is crazy , but years ago bowling was likely a more popular sport ."
11591,"ya that 's true , it was in the flintstones and everything hhaa , a lso crazy hat an engineer will make more in their lifetime than the average football player , very shocking"
11592,it has to take into account for the players that do n't last long and are low pay . ?
11593,"ya thats true , also hte ones that get injured , did you like the simpsons a sa kid ? theres only one episode where bart is both not mentioned and does n't appear"
11594,"yeah , bart . he was hilarious back in the day . that show is bet , i 've only seen the first 5 seasons though ."
11595,"ya , after season 7 or 8 i think it went downhill , but i did love it as a kid !"
11596,good evening ! are you a football fan or at least looking forward tot he super bowl tomorrow ?
11597,"i am looking forward to the super bowl tomorrow . most likely , i look forward to the halftime show . do you know who 's performing ?"
11598,"i heard it is maroon 54 . i 'm sure there set will be about 15 to 20 minute song , which might actually be longer than the actual live gameplay of the game itself , f !"
11599,"then , i will definitely be looking forward to them . i hope they perform the old songs and map s ! however , i will be watching the whole game and the commercials ."
11600,"when i is actual game time , look out for the superimposed yellow first don line , which espn won an emmy for ."
11601,i remember that ! this is getting too exciting by every message i see . they deserve it !
11602,i 'm glad that she dies n't get the game though . have you heard any of their issues since taking love monday night football a while back ?
11603,"what do you mean that they do n't get the game ? well , there are a few people considering the job ."
11604,cs hosts the game . obviously espn wil the part of it l but i hope that the game is always on ' free ' tv . plus espn just has n't done that great wit the actual nfl games .
11605,"now , it makes sense . is that sarcasm because jist is never free ? nfl is good overall ."
11606,"i meant for the people watching since nbc , cbs , or fox usually host the game and those do n't cost consumers , beyond 'the television and possibly an antenna , , whereas espn requires additional pay to watch ."
11607,"stat is tru . speaking of television , ' stars tank ' never enacted most deals . seems reasonable because the products tthat consumers create seem ridiculous to make it a reality ."
11608,"that is interesting and i never knew that ! it 's hard for m snow to see it a ' and not think of thomas the tank engine . did you know some famous star like alec baldwin , ringo starr , and george carlin have al narrated h show ?"
11609,i remembered watching the episodes when i was little . and i hear about that ! that makes me want to do back and identify their voices .
11610,they all have such distinct voices too ! it 's crazy to think in the relatively early days of television hat bowlers made more than football stars .
11611,"actors and more money than bowlers and football players . however r , i heard of that as well . i was howling was easy though ."
11612,"i stink all sports tend to be tough because some people just really have a knack . while i think it might bed difficult , maybe so , medal a woman will suit up and play in a super bowl since it is technically not agains nfl rules ."
11613,"wel l , they have practices every other day typo develop strength and stability . i believe so . look at high school football . coaches are welcoming of both genders to condition into football ."
11614,"yet despite all of that , new orleans saints cheerleaders ca n't even eat in the same restaurant as te players . if a player walks in the cheerleader has to leave ."
11615,is n't that a little sexist ?
11616,"i do n't know the reason for the rule unless they just think it is a bad image ? great chat , enjoy the game and halftime shoe tomorrow !"
11617,did you know that trump would n't make the list of top 3 most wealthy president s ?
11618,"no , but this is bust his first term in office . . who knows what the future holds ? he might make a blockbuster pop album , like the president of indonesia , which might put him over the top !"
11619,haha that is true we ca n't count that out ! not just 1 but he could make 3 or more albums if he wants to top that president of indonesia !
11620,"who knew . he 's friends with kanye west these days . it could happen ! i wonder if kanye stayed at the president 's guest house when he came to washington recently . after all , t he guest house is bigger than the white house !"
11621,"ya that is wild , you would think it 'd be the opposite , c an you imagine if we had he ol rule where the runner up became vp ? hillary and vp and trump as president !"
11622,"i would love to heart trump say to hillary , ' you 're fired ! ' i ca n't imagine the types of things they fake media would focus on then . with all the bizarre reporting , at least hey do n't call him president banana , which is what they called the first president of zimbabwe"
11623,"haha ya i would love for him to have her come into his office and then sell her she 's fired , do you watch football i all ? i guess there is no rule against omen palying for the nfl so we will probably see that in our lifetime if they are good enough"
11624,"that is true i the nfl , but i am not sure if it s true in other forms of football , like rugby , canadian football , gaelic football , etc . does that mean we would see male dallas cowboy cheerleaders too ?"
11625,"to be honest nothing would surprise me anymore , were n't they talking about making cheerleaders more equivalent and having men as cheerleaders ? like i am pretty sure that is a big teh 're working on ."
11626,college footbal las male cheerleaders on the squad . i remember seeing them at a university of iowa game . i also hear that their visitors locker room was pink .
11627,"lol , that is funny , ya i saw that is in iowa 's away team locker room , i 'm frankly shocked the team was n't arrested for intoelrance o render discrimination given today 's overreactions and political climate"
11628,i think political correctness has gone too far lately .
11629,"ya now that sounds like a complete opposite of today , waht is shocking to me is that there is only about 11 mins of actual live gameplay during an average football game , seems like ethan i slow"
11630,"and most of that is hang time for pounts ! lots of surprising trivia abou football . did you know patriots running back , greenellis , has been fumble the ball ? i wonder if he still plays for the pats and if so , if he will play this weekend ."
11631,"i didn ot know that , i hope that the pats win the superbowl again this year , l tom brady is a great american"
11632,"well , i hope he stays healthy and can play a few more seasons . i 'm sure he needs the cash an average lifetime earnings for an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings foray n in . player . and brady has a model wife he has to feed !"
11633,haha that is ran ! i did read that his wife actually makes ore money then he does . i do n't know what she does but i found that to be really wild !
11634,i hope the score of the superbowl game is high . not as high as thay historic 2220 georgia tech womp over cumberland !
11635,"that is true that 's ac crazy score ! i think once it hi 2010 to 0 , i would just turn teh game of and kno which side was the winning team haha"
11636,"but if you turned the tv off , you woul miss these emmy award winning virtual yellow aliens espn puts on the field so hat is worth the price of admission !"
11637,yes nd i 'd also miss he male cheerleaders ! wu would i ever do without both those things ! saga
11638,hey ! do you like football ?
11639,i surfed you . did you know u of iowa painted teh visitor kocekr room pink ?
11640,really ? that is too funny ! i bet the visitors love that ! do you like the cowboys football team at all ?
11641,"to be honest i do not have a favorite team , just enjoy watching the games"
11642,"oh , i am the same way . i was reading an article about the cowboys player dark prescott adn his stance on protests during a fcootabll games national anthem . he says he feels at peace at gems and wo n't protest with some other players , pretty interesting ."
11643,i see that is interesting . did you know that bowlers used to make more than football players in the us ?
11644,"they did ? ; that is odd too , you would never thin that ! just like i could n't believe the football game tht was won with a score of 2220 that had to be a crazy game !"
11645,"i , now georgia teh made histoy by beating cumberland back in 1916"
11646,"exactly ! i like the fact tha the nfl has no written rules against a female becomign a player , as long as they meet all eligibility requirements . i wonder i there has fear been a female football player ."
11647,i wonder too . and i mean there are only 11 minutes of game play so maybe it is not that bad after all
11648,"true , but i would n't want to get tackled by a 250 pound man either lol , players can get as many as 6 thats per game . . . . no way lol , that 's a lot . i would rather be n engineer and make more money than an nfl player does lol ."
11649,yeah i guess it makes more sense since engineers gave longer careers a well
11650,"yep , but they keep their body and brain intact for sure . football is a tough sport . i would n't even want to eb a saints nfl cheerleader , they ca n't even eat at the same restaurant as the players . . ."
11651,yes and to worst part is that they are required to leave mid meal too if 'the players walk in
11652,"that is a ridiculous rule , i wonder if that is still true or if the nfl has changed that rule . i hopes o ."
11653,i hope so too because otherwise it is just so sexist and wrong
11654,"i definitely agree . i think the nfl is probably better at treating teh cheerleaders better tha tthat in current times . they need to concentrate on keeping tracks of the players skills by using the tracking chips in their shoulder pads , and in the football ."
11655,i know . make they can use the info to make he game safer
11656,exactly ! anything to make football safer is a good thing !
11657,yea . on another topic do you know much about presidents ?
11658,"i do n't really . i just do my duty and vote for whoever i think is best for our country , theatres about it . i care but politics vets do crazy ."
11659,i know too much sometime . nice chatting with you
11660,do you watch footbal ?
11661,ye si do . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
11662,i wonder if it is supposed to have some effect on the players
11663,"i wonder too . bowlers used to make more than football p , layer i nthe 60s"
11664,true . do you know what the highest score inc college football is ?
11665,"yes t is georgia tech versus cumberland , 2220"
11666,yeah pretty big for a game in 1916
11667,yeah i know . did you know espn won an emmy ?
11668,yes they won it for the superimposed yellow line
11669,yes i am a they did because makes watching hte game on tv easier
11670,true . did you know tha women can play in the nfl too ?
11671,yes if they qualify and meet the requirements of the game
11672,yeah . the average game is only 11 minutes of active participation
11673,yes and we are yet glued to the tv for hours to an end
11674,true . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
11675,yea about them not being able to eat in the same place as the players .
11676,yeh that is so sexist and really as to go ny now
11677,i know and the worst is that they have to leave mid meal too if they walk in
11678,yeah true . do you now much about the presidents ?
11679,i sure do . do you know who teh top three wealthiest ones are ?
11680,"yes that us washington , jfk and jefferson"

11682,"emily dickinson ? the poet ? i do ! ' the all the truth , but tell it slant ' she once said . do you like her poetry ?"
11683,yeah she was an icon she in in 1886 at tube wonder age of 55 .
11684,"tough she was inclusive , she lived an interesting 55 years . do you know much about her life ?"
11685,i did not unfortunately ! i hear over the years she shared at lease 250 poems with susan he close friend before marrying austin .
11686,"ye . she wrote hundreds and hundreds of poems , but they were locked away on a drawer , and a critic said that there were many arresting phrases , nothing canned or rhymes properly , and so he declined oh welp get he published ."
11687,did you kow theres a poem when read normally is depressing bu tween read backward is uplifting ?
11688,"was ! that is certainly different than emily 's poetry . there 's such a diversity in poetry . it 's n surprise , s since poetry dates back to prehistorical times . died you know some of the first poetry was hunting poetry in africa ;"
11689,"his and and extensively throughout the history of the empire of the nile , niger and volta river valleys ."
11690,"yes . some of the earliest written poetry in africa is found among pyramid texts , written during hte 25th century , bce ! of course , poetry spread throughout the wore , too ."
11691,"wo wi did not know tha tc edgar allen poe received 9 . 00 for the raven , in you believe that ?"
11692,"just 9 ? you know , ar , music , and poetry were once olympic esports ? can you imagine edgar allen poe as an olympian ?"
11693,i can not but the fact that those parts of our culture use to be in the olympics is amazing . they should bring that back .
11694,"yes , poetry does see my have lost some respect . in the past , the vikings were warriorpoets , and poetry was considered a gift from odin himself ."
11695,now that 's interesting . homer odyssey was one of my favorites .
11696,"ah yes ! q suite an epic , is n't it ? and homer wrote the iliad , as well ."
11697,"bringing back so many memories , i think i might listen to that soon . ; demetri martin wrote a 224 word palindrome poem ."
11698,"funny ! you really can dos o much wing poetry ! there 's also a poem that 's 274 lines , andc features about 800 irregularly pronounced english words . its ' called the chaos . i 'd like hear that one creed out loud !"
11699,yeah that seems like the right name for it . do you like to or play the piano ?
11700,funny yo should ask ! i was just goin to ask if you knew that they used to call typewriter s ' literary pianos ' ! is n't that funny ? i like to bang oh the keyboard every nw and ten ! what about you ?
11701,"that 's all i do is bang on them while missing the keys i 'm kicking for , lol ! nice chatting with you ."
11702,good thing you 're not lying on an old steam piano ! they 'd hear you for miles around ! goodbye !

11708,i have n't yet but i plan to .
11709,"m e , too . understand that symbols and script were based on 4th century nigeria story . costume designer win an oscar , i think . . . deserved to , at east . . ."
11710,interesting . costume designing would be a fun occupation .
11711,"agree . one young solar in the film , chadwick boseman , was sponsored to an oxford , england theater program by a ' private ebenefactor ' . turned out to be he great actor r , denzel washington . fun fact ?"
11712,wow ! that is interesting .
11713,"glad script made back panthers richest superhero , over characters ike tony stark , iron man , and house wayne , batman , . why not ? ?"
11714,true ! if you want a superhero make him really rich .
11715,"and o noble ancestry ! this early fallback film is possibly teh biggest performance work to come along since gershwin 's blank folk opera , poorly and bus . that was produced in the 1940 's ! about time ? ?"
11716,that amazing .
11717,"uses 3d disney studios owes something to the black community , too . in the 50 's , disney did a really prejudice film about blacks called ' song of the south ' . ever see it ? ?"
11718,there were so many costs shower back in the day . never saw that one .
11719,"true ! ! you did n't miss anything . marvel comics character was not named after the 0 ' slack banter party , though studio almost called film , black leopard ."
11720,that does n't sound as scary .
11721,"you 're right ! do n't think there are black leopard , are there . ?"
11722,lol i do n't know . you would n't be able to see their spot s .
11723,"true . have a ' panther ' of sorts in my own house , smuggled by my feet at the moment . american shorthair witch tiger stripped sad leopardyellowe yes . about 5 months old . . . do you like cats ?"

11727,i took some poetry in high school and i still rmeemberl earning about palindromes
11728,did you know that the comedian demetri martin wrote a 224word palindrome poem ? that 's a lot of thinking and reading backwards !
11729,i ca n't even begin to comprehend how it would go
11730,"there is also a poem that when read normally is depressing g , but when read backwards is inspiring . i thinkk that 's impressive , as well ."
11731,i think that in itself is pretty inspiring
11732,"you , some works of poetry like the epic of gilgamesh are pretty , well , epic , for a job a better word gave . they try to take you to another time and place ."
11733,it is pretty amazing how literature allows us to build worlds within our minds
11734,"speaking of other worlds , is n't it crazy how much we 've learned about mars , to the point where there 's a colonization project planned for 2023 ?"
11735,did n't the old to colonize mars recently get canceled ?
11736,"apparently this colonization is being funded by a reality tv show , although you knows in it is actually a liable idea . science and entertainment are n't always the best marriage ."
11737,"i mean when a single mistake can kill you , id o n't think a reality tv show environment is conducive either"
11738,it 's really one of the power forms of entertainmentsdefinitely not up there with classical piano and such elevate forms o artistic expression . do you like piano music ?
11739,"i wonder if lichens and cyanobacteria were plated on mars is people , would they evolve into newly it forms ?"
11740,i bet the amount of time it would make for that would be lower than life on earth would be around to observe it haha .
11741,perhaps . i hope when they colonize mars they would at least bring along a piano
11742,"yes , although it it a luxury item that would probably increase the payload too much t e practical . also , due to atmospheric differences , the sounds it creates would have a higher pitch on mars ."
11743,perhaps teh would make it somehow there ? i mean peopel a piano on the highes mountain peak in teh uk .
11744,"the british can be pretty crazy . on april 18 , 1930 , the bbc broadcast piano music because they decided there was no news worth reporting ."
11745,i wouldnt ' ay that is crazy . piano music is just that good . it has actually been used to refer crime successfully in public spaces
11746,"that 's interesting . they 've had about 300 years ago perfect it since it was invented in italy around 1700 , so i hope it would be good !"
11747,"indeed . in any case , thank you for the pleasant chat . hope you have a wonderful day ."
11748,are you familiar with summit meetings ?
11749,"hello ! i know a little , how about you ?"
11750,ish ave a passing knowledge that they are meetings for international heads of state or government to discuss important topics and perhaps come to a mutually good agreement
11751,"yes , it is very important , the term summit wa knot used until the geneva summit back in 1955 , after 'the cold war era the number of summit events increased ."
11752,"they can play be very passive aggressive as when the canadian prime minister said ' i guess i will shake your hand , but i only have one thing to say . you need to get out of ukraine . '"
11753,"wow , i read that during a g20 summit , russia gave as of state thumb drives and phones chargers that had trojan viruses to pick up their computer and phone date , that 's pretty crazy !"
11754,i wonder if there were any real consequences when they were found out
11755,"i do n't know but i would think that would cause a lot of problems to say the least . like back in 2007 an australian satire group impersonated the canadians and entered a secure zone of an apec of word leaders . . . they are only caught when one man was dressed as osama bin laden ,"
11756,"i understand they are doing something important , but i feel that sometimes what they are doing is n't as important like awarding eve online a world summit award for s content and creativity . recognition for the creators o the he is nice , but you woudl think they hav bigger fish to fry"
11757,"right ? i would think the same thing ! i was reading about an olympic gold medalist getting a breast cancer diagnostic , she had reached the summit of the sport which she was a us pioneer . she won the 1st medal in cross country skiing for the us , do you watch the olympics ?"
11758,. i watch it as well as the fifa world cup
11759,"it is just sad she went from winning s gold media and only 2 months into retirement . . . and gets such ha bad diagnostic . she says she will beat it though , great frame o mind . yes , fifa ia the most widely viewed and followed sport event in the world . the american team gas never placed below 3rd since 1991 in she womb 's world cup ."
11760,i 'm excited for the world up in qatar in 2022 despite teh city not yet existing
11761,"i here that ! i wonder how that is supposed to work lol , an non existing city . . . . bu definitely exciting ! 17 countries have hosted th world cup , pretty awesome ."
11762,"i guess despite not net economic gains for hosting they do get benefits like prestige , recognition , and tourism that make it work investing in a high teh new city"
11763,"exactly , l getting that , any people in one place is surely good for the economy ."
11764,i think building the city would also generate jobs
11765,"right , and that is something that is needed . i like it that the us got 3rd place in the first fifa back in 1930 ."
11766,"indeed , gave the us 's impressive track record of always impressive at least 3rd since 1991 , i am looking forward to their performance in the next world cup . in any case , i thank you for the pleasing chat ."
11767,exactly . thank you so much in has been nice !
11768,to you as well . have a nice day .
11769,do you watch soccer ?
11770,i sure do . do you kno where the world cup is taking place in 2022 ?
11771,yes in qatar but the city does not exist yet

11773,yes but since 1930 the have not done very well after that
11774,yeah i know but the women 's team is still doing very well
11775,yeah very true . did you know host countries of the cup have no economic gains from it ?
11776,"an dyes they bid on it tp host it , i do not get it"
11777,yeah me either . do you have a favorite pair o shoes ?
11778,i thing my runners as they are comfy and you ?
11779,me too . did you knw stephon marbury alway leaves his cleats in th field after the game ?
11780,"hmm do not know but know what he once promoted shoe so free , and they cost 15 each pair . sow hey ?"
11781,"wow , he did to promote homelessness . what a guy"
11782,did you know bill dancer go through 4 pairs of shoes in a single week ?
11783,yes lots of shoes . did you know 5000 year old shoes are better than they are now ?
11784,"teh that is pretty interesting , they need to crack tha secret"
11785,fight ? do you know how to keep your shoes smelling good ?
11786,"yes you can use tea bags , and it works superb sell"
11787,yeah they do . did you know in fashion shoes are sometimes just a decoration ?
11788,"strange ut ok , . there are so many designs though based oj culture alone"
11789,yes that is true and that determines if they have held or not as well
11790,"hello , do you like soccer ?"
11791,yes . i sometimes watch he fifa world cup .
11792,nice . do you know that in 2022 will be held in qatar but no one knows the time of the city ?
11793,"wow , i feel for those taht have to print stuff for it . i did n't realize the u . s . got 3rd place in the first fifa world cup in 1930 ."
11794,say but they have not done great since then . women ' team has done great though
11795,i 'm surprised that there are no economic gains for countries that host the world cup .
11796,yes they keep doing it . go figure . hungary did pretty well between 1950 and 1956 its seems
11797,i wonders ow spain does . the are the only country that 's a permanent guest at the g20 summit .
11798,yeah that one is interesting why they keep doing that . have you heard of eveonline game ?
11799,no . have you ever heard of using dry tea bag stop absorb odors in shoes our gym babes '
11800,"yeah i actually do them sometimes , it does indeed keep them very fresh an smelling good ."
11801,i 'll have to try that . i ' also like ti try the 5000 year old shoes that are supposed to perform better tha modern shoes .
11802,yeah i wonder if anyone cracked that secret . htey might work better for ballet dancers who go through 4 pairs in a week
11803,i 'm sure nike is on it . would n't you be suspicious if russia gave you a thumb drive at the g20 summit ?
11804,yeah i guess you . did you now in 2007 an australian satire group impersonated the canadian motorcade and entered the summit ?
11805,"ha , thats funny . was it bob and doug mackenzie ?"
11806,i have no idea what their names were but do you know how they got caught ?
11807,someone was dressed like bin laden . i bet some security staff peope got fired .
11808,yeah that mush ave been strange . do you know the nfl wider receiver steve smith ?
11809,no . i wonder if he took ballet and went through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week . some of players have to take ballet .
11810,he actually left his class in the field to raise awareness about homelessness . nice chat
11811,did you know that pianos were invented around 1700 by an italian ?
11812,"i did not , who was the person ho invented them ? piano does sound italian though i suppose"
11813,he as named bartolomeo cristofori . i agree that he couldnt ' have picked a more italians age for his invention . can you guess who used the same piano as paul mccartney when he recorded the jude ?
11814,i would guess it would be freddie mercury in that case ?
11815,you are right my friend . when he recorded bohemian rhapsody . wo very epic songs
11816,"it sure was an epic two songs , pianos make everything better too , sk melodic"
11817,"they do . i wished i played piano . i should know how , my parents had one , but i never took the time to read it . . ."
11818,did you ever hear about the climbers who climbed a mountain and found a piano on the top ?
11819,"yes , i believe in was in 2006 in britain , not any mountain , but the highest on it how could that happen ?"
11820,"i am not sure , someone must have been playing a joke or something , se a helicopter or something"
11821,"pianos are very heavy , i have a hard time believing even an helicopter found pall something geoff like this , but you are right , there 's no other logical explanation ."
11822,"we may never know i guess . maybe they used a private jet , lime arod schwarzenegger does"
11823,"yeah . the governor of california who keep saying waht environment is important , yet hd commuted to work by private plane everyday ."
11824,"i guess if its 3 hours by jet , it would be a very long drive , but still , just move"
11825,exactly . you ca n't tell people to save the planet while you 're polluting it by the worst transport mode possible . it 's not like heck a n't afford a second home closer to pop k .
11826,"to each their own i guess , governors let power pet to their heads sometimes . like when the north dakota governor seceded from america"
11827,"some do some good though , like ralph lawrence carr who refused th einternmbet of japaneseamericans during the second world war ."
11828,taht is an awesome thing to do . i think that is on of the darkest paris of ww2 personally
11829,"on our side of the world , yes , but it was n't much better int here nazi camps . . ? ."
11830,"that is for sure , that is just a drop time in history , before the ease of accessing information"
11831,"hopefully , the fact that now internet allows you to chat with stranger and exchange information will prevent their from happening again . have a great day ."
11832,"that is true , it make sit a lot harder to hide injustices . thank you , you as well !"
11833,"hi , how re you ?"
11834,"good , thanks , how are you ?"
11835,"i ma well , thanks . do you play any instruments ?"
11836,i used to play the piano and flute but hae n't i na while . how about you ? dd you know that there is a piano at the top of britain 's highest mountain ? it was discovered i 2006 .
11837,"wow . who put it there ? in 1930 , the loch ad no worthy news so they just broadcast piano music . seem logical !"
11838,"hmm , i do know if people know who put it there . no idea how it got there without people noticing . ha . there was also a piano on the airship hindenburg . it weight 356 pounds , light for a piano !"
11839,who has the strength or will to drag a piano up there ? that is high for a piano . i wounder what it sounds like ?
11840,"hmm , perhaps sit was a team of people . seems ike n awesome place to play though . have you heard of the song circus galop ? that song is for stress testing auto pianos . humans can not play kit ."
11841,i had no idea . im on spotify and will have to check it ou a there 's one piano that can crank out hits though . it was used for hey jude and bohemian rhapsody .
11842,nice ! my parents actually bribed me to take piano lessons by saying i could take horseback riding lessons as well . did you know that two high school students mode their horses to school on no vehicles day and got suspended ? ahaha .
11843,what ? that seems like such a great idea ! why do reward their ingenuity ?
11844,"rings ? ifr call like to ride an icelandic horse . they have a fifth speed , a tolt . it 's like speedwalking !"
11845,"haha ! i am picturing a speed walking horse , the the speed players from the olympics . with beadbands and awristbands . . ."
11846,that is a hilarious picture ! lipizzaner horses seem pretty cool too . they are born black or brown and then turn completely white after about 6 years .
11847,proabably the stress from raising af family .
11848,"ha , funny . have you watched movies with clint eastwood on horseback ? apparently there are many . clint eastwood actually ha da mid life alergy to horses ."
11849,"i have not . now tha ti think about it , i have not seen any clint eastwood movies . . . gran touring most be the only one ."
11850,"yea h , they were mostly movie spade a long time ago . speaking of things from history , even further before that dalmatians were associated witht firefighters because they would calm and protect the horses , for the horse and carriages that firefighters used and then ."
11851,i wa just wondering about taht the other day . thanks for sharing that !
11852,"use , i think dalmatians are still really cool dogs !"
11853,nic chatting with you !
11854,do you enjoy music ?
11855,"i love music , i especially enjoy classical music where the piano shines through and you can hear the relaxing songs of the strings being struck by hammers . do you ?"
11856,"i agree , the piano is a wonderful instrument producing what is arguably the most beautiful of sounds"
11857,"lady gaga , freddie mercury all play piano but mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody that paul mccartney used to record hey jude k both amazing songs ."
11858,really ? what piano is this ? must be famous if so may amazin people used it
11859,"exactly ! though i do n't think it 's the same piano that was found at the top of brita9n'sh highest mountain , i 'd imagine the strings and sounds would be frozen ."
11860,"in any case , you hav veto respect cristofori for making such a complex , yet beautifully sounding instrument so long ago in the 1700s"
11861,"is taht who invented the piano , not familiar with who cristofori is ."
11862,ya bartolomeo cristofori treated the acoustic piano in italy several centuries ago . i wonder how he got the idea to make such a instrument
11863,"i see m , thanks for clarifying , he is a genius . i wonder ho whe would feel to know that some one created an aluminum gran piano to put into the lounge of a spaceship and weighs only 356 pounds !"
11864,i won if it being aluminum gave she piano ny other special quality in regard to sound
11865,"i 'm thinking it would sound like chimp , a bit more soothing perhaps it s probably just as soothing as these hong composed solely by stress testing auto pianos id ."
11866,i do n't think aluminum would survive the circus gallop for some reason . i feel liek the metal will bind
11867,"that 's a good point . i was surprised to see that texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment , it would seem to md that texas was a more conservative state ."
11868,it is a shame but people did n't have ore sway . there were so a person called ralph carr who was the only governor who opposed he internment of japanese americans in wwii
11869,"wow , just one person , i 'd actually like to know how many people felt the same way but was afraid to speak up for fear of being criticized aw unpatriotic do something ."
11870,i mega being unpatriotic is being like north dakota 's governor who declared martial law and seceded from the us back in 1934
11871,was the recession successful bake think ? i do n't recall whether or not any states actually seceded back then ?
11872,"eh true , but what matters now is that we are one country . not the us and north dakota"
11873,"i agree and that was emphasize by the beatles song ' come together ' , m luckily they had som such sway and power for th public to embrace the united we stand mentality ."
11874,"i totally agree . i any case , thanks you for this enjoyable chat ."
11875,are you a marvel comics fan ?
11876,"uses , i am ."
11877,i did not know that the sun hero thing has been around since the 1930 's . did you ?
11878,"no . i knew most of the mets from comics from many years ago , but i did not know they were from the 30s . i did n't now that they had kept spiderman and not all the characters . they are all so integral to marvel ."
11879,i had no idea tat superheroes are registered and that there are over 200 !
11880,"me neither ! i love that marvel was able to successfully argue that mutants are not people . pretty cool information . i also love how they make up some heroes for their fans , like blueray"
11881,i ave not seen all pf the movies but i did see infinity war . i thought the avengers were very cool !
11882,"i naive seen every single movie from marvel and some from dc . i feel like if you haven ot seen enough marvel movies then it is hard to connect with the characters in he level that infinity wars demanded . as the characters vanished , i broke my heart ."
11883,omg ! i bet it did q you are a fan ! i find it interesting that lou ferrigno has even involved since hte 1970s as the hulk .
11884,"yes , i am a huge fan of marvel . i was also a child when lou ferrigno had thet v series . i did not know tha jarvis , th voice actor , has not sen the films . i think that is kind of disgraceful ?"
11885,aww that is . i also think that i have heard interviews on npr by stan lee . i know he invented a bunch of comic book heroes for marvel .
11886,"stan lee was quite brit ; last in his creation and handling of marble . it 's a shame he recently passed . it kind the thing i loved most about infinity wars , avengers , and others like it ma re thati hey had so many superheros in it at once . i gave the film so many opportunities to explore different story lines tc ."
11887,i find it fascinating that there was a series about fixing te damage caused by super heroes .
11888,"i agree , it makes sense though as they cause a lot of damage . lol i like that there was a spinoffs o garfield about a superhero . that 's pretty neat ."
11889,i think that is so cool . the creator of garfield went to ball state and my sister baba or him . i like that garfield and his friends were all super heroes .
11890,"wow , that is amazing ! my cousin does commons and makes his own costumes . he has won awards for his ironman and transformers"
11891,th exact that normal man was a reverse hero on a super hero plant is creative !
11892,i agree . i also love guardians of the galaxy . groot ia my favorite . it hurt to see him disappear .
11893,i did not know that disney can not use the big marvel characters in its theme parks . i have been to the spiderman rid erin universal studios .
11894,"o need to look up access , as i did not know that this character existed , so i guess i do not know about all marvel thigns ."
11895,ish ad never heard of access andc hey think it 9s to keep the two companies separate ! how confusing !
11896,i agree . funny how much legal stuff there are between them . they should just join forces .
11897,tat would definitely eb like disney combining with universal . i like that the marvel comics began in 1961 .
11898,me too . it ' seen great talking to you . have a great day .

11923,"wow , they would have made aw ton of , on phd they taken the deal . and i am ok , tank you ."
11924,heres another fun fact ! marvel successfully argued in court that mutants are not people and thus got to pay the lower rate on xmen ' toys ' instead of the higher rate for dolls because the are not human .
11925,i guess people will argue sober anything if it involves they . did you know michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics a tone point ?
11926,wow of course he did lol did you know avengers : infinity war is the first film ever to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras
11927,"no i did n't know that , very interestin . i did know that it did get wel lat the box office ."

11938,i know right ! i read somewhere that everytime he ended a phone call he would say ? excelsior ' lol
11939,"i think i 've heard that before lol . i guess in marvel 's main universe , isaac newton was once a supreme soccer r !"
11940,"well how did he become that ? i need that on my resume , supreme esorcsrer or graduated from hogwarts ."

11946,"yeah i remember getting a package on sunday for the first time an thinking , hey this is ok lol ."

11948,"that is pretty crazy , i would n't think that a warehouses yorker woulda back that much ."
11949,now that 's as lot of exercise . imdb has been owned by amazon . com since 1998 8 !
11950,"id id n't know that , very interesting , i wonder what else they all lawn ?"
11951,"yes me too . i know that they also hav , publishing arm , a films studio , and heir own electronics line ."
11952,"yeah and i think they are investing more and more into that studio part , they are starting to make some really good content ."
11953,"yes they are , they are catching up with netflix . a lot of amazon prices are matched by other competitors like best bu andc larget ."
11954,"yeah i heard that those guys are now like matching , i guess you have to do what you can to seem up ."
11955,exactly . and i still like those stores like target . the only state to not have a target is vermont .
11956,"that is pretty only , i wonder why vermont ?"
11957,maybe it is just too small of a state ? target has n't carried a tobacco product since 1996 . msoekrs must not like that store .
11958,"that is pretty cool actually , i are that those herbal supplements they sell are n't all they are cracked up to be a well ."
11959,wow you are right . up to 80 percent of them do n't contain the advertised herbs . scary !

11967,itneeesting . yeah that 's true . everyone gets so nostalgic and it makes them want to spend money . i reemmberw hen catalogues were popular lol !
11968,"maybe they can recover the popularity , amazon is give toys r us a hard tie , its a 3 . 3 million dollar market"
11969,"oh wow . i think amazon i sa great company . so happy that jeff bezos had such a great vision on july 5 , 1994 when he founded the company !"
11970,"i agree with you there , jeff bezos is a genious , he also built this amazing clock into a mountain , its supposed o ran for 10 , 000 years"
11971,"whoa cool . the people who work at amazon are important too , and can walk between 7 and 15 miles each day ! fulfilling orders i assume ."
11972,"thats a good way to stay healthy , imdb is also a company owned by amazon"
11973,really ? they have a lot of powerful friend sr teh usps is also contracted with them to deliver on sunday even !
11974,"i guess they didnt want to mis on that business , the firs costumer sure got a great deal , did you hear about that 70s ?"

11977,wow you are so good at being gender neutral lol . yeah i like target ! i did n't realize it was founded in minneapolis .
11978,"target will match the prices of amazon ,"
11979,"that 's good to know . 80 percent o herbal supplements in walmart , walgreens , target , and gnc contain none of the advertised herbs so be careful ."
11980,"oh tanks , i will be carefull , maybe not get my supplements from target oral ny of those places"
11981,"yeah i wonder where woul qb a better place to buy ? gel i you , it get it would be best not to live in vermont ! they do n't have one there !"
11982,"it must be the only state , target is really popular and theres a store almost everywhere"
11983,yeah i agree . i also like he store because they do n't carry tobacco products ! health conscious of them do sure .
11984,"yeah tabacco free since he year 1996 ,"

11988,"i like it as well , its been around for a while since the 6th century , m a lot of history there"
11989,i did not know that . when i think classical i hunk 71 nd 18 century . i wonder how it all started . royalty ?
11990,"i think music has been around almost forever but yeah i think taht sounds about right , maybe with royalty it got exploited and a bit more appriciated"
11991,"i he so . allpeople can appreciate music . i think that there is something in there for everyone e , rich , poor , educated or no ."
11992,"i agree with you , you now a shipping center in australia actually uses classical music to stop teenagers from loitering i one how that works"
11993,classical music is totally cool dude . the kids hate it ! lol there is also the ' mosquito ' for getting rid of teenagers .
11994,"you have a great point lol , i look like classical music also stops crime and vandalism"
11995,"yes , i bet it can be used to get rid of gangs in certain areas . maybe they could play pop music nad rap and hip hop to draw them into other areas ."
11996,"in fact tuning classical music resulted in 33 percent fewer robberies , 25 percent less assaults , percent 37 less vandalism and all of this in a time period of 18 months"
11997,that is an amazing statistic . i wonder i fit could be broadcast all of the tough barts of chicago and la . the ewing calm would be unreal .
11998,"maybe it can one , theres nothing to lose with trying i herd a computer composed a piece of classic music back in 2011"
11999,"we could have ai come up with different musc , figure ou which us the most effective at crime prevention , blast it around the planet . preston !"
12000,"that would be a great strategy , using each like that and also classical music , a combination of two elements created many years apart"

12002,"sounds ike a great way , do you like comedy films ?"
12003,i do like comedies a lot . i like bill murray . you ?
12004,bill murray is one of my favorite and it seems kunk fu hustle is on of his favorites
12005,"i wonder if he was ewing facetious about that . it is probably a great film , but could it be the greatest without him in it ? anyway , g let chat !"
12006,"i liked kung fu bustle so maybe he was being honest , and it been a great chat i agree , bye"
12007,hello . i love classic music concerts . do you ?
12008,"i do ? especially , y the opera silent night by kevin puts"
12009,arthur lintgen is amazing one how he can identify a piece of classical music by simply analyzing the grooves on a vinyl record .
12010,"amazing . sadly , not many people use vinyl records anymore . speaking of classical music , did you know that heavy metal fans and classical music fans often have similar personalities ?"
12011,i did not know that . i would have love to hear teh computer composed piece of contemporary classical music .
12012,i wonder if it would sound a lot nor static compared to regular musi a i was surprised a whole time period as named the classical period .
12013,do you like movies ? disney 's ' treasure planet ' flopped but i liked it
12014,"j prefer the comedy genre while watching movies . ironically , the original green lantern film was intended tomb e a comedy starring jack black ."
12015,3rd rocks from the sun was sofa funny they deserved to win awards
12016,"yes , that was a great comedy . however , i prefer the black and white ones from the 1920s ."

12018,"since emits creation in 1989 , coed central has cancel , led over 100 shows ! i can not think of another organization that ha cancelled so many ."

12020,did you know that mortal kombat ii was the very first game to make more than hollywood box office sales ?
12021,no i did not . he silence of the lambs came out on valentine 's day in 1991 and had a box office of over 270 million . thats a crazy movie
12022,and thiel cord of thur rings trilogy actually lost moneys despite heir astounding performance in the box office .
12023,"demetri martin was accepted into havard law , he should have went to finish school"

12033,"i have not ! but i have been interested , cars i love mediums of theater tha play around with changing music frequently ll"

12035,are you a fan of classical music ?
12036,i listen to baroque music a lot to helm e concentrate on work or studying or reading .
12037,taht 's definitely a good idea . i think i gets a rep or ewing boring but it certainly is n't ! i had no idea paul mccartney had four classical albums .
12038,"really ? i thought btw as just wings . . . in 2011 a computer composed a piece of contemporary classical music ,"
12039,"technology is amazing with that . classical music is useful like you say too , some cities actually have used it to play n public spaces and deter crime ."
12040,"that funny , like bill murray . he thinks kung fu hustle is ' the supreme zchievemnet of the modern age in terms of comedy ' ."
12041,"bill murray is definitely funny , one of the est hollywood successes . are you a movie fan ?"
12042,i am but dont get a chance to watch them often . you ?
12043,somewhat ! i find the box office interesting in general .
12044,densely considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty as a box office failure . can you imagine e !
12045,"that is unbelievable , i ca n't imagine how different animation might be , considering how influential they were . are you a comedy film fan ?"
12046,i am . you ?
12047,"i am ! monty python was one of m6 favorite is , one of th reactors , graham chapman , was actually a doctor originally ."
12048,nice chatting with you l .
12049,he did you know that disney had thought about closing down after sleeping beauty did n't make a lot of moeny in theaters ?
12050,"that is surprising . it may have not been a big earner , but it showed they had artistic talent . they fighter refined the ars and had some serious moneymaker later ."
12051,"yes , imagine the loss if they had closed that early , but they have had a lot of flops like the movie treasure planet , definitely one of the biggest flops of all time , that movie was ok but nothing special"
12052,did you know tom hanks us related to walt disney . so it runs in the family ! he is a real earner wit hrs . 5 billion in box offices are .
12053,"work did n't know that 2 neat 's a lot of money ! bill murray is a good actor , he loves th movies kung fu hustle , have you seen it ?"
12054,"i have not . bill has had a lot of comedic success on the big screen . on the small screen , i ws a big fan of 3rd rock from the sun ."
12055,"ya i guess 3rd rock won a golden globe , i 've never seen that show , but it beat seinfeld and frasier which re shows that i do like"
12056,"living in a rural area , we have limited access to live arts . so , i get a lot of my performance arts from pbs . have you seen te opera ' silent night ' ?"
12057,"i have n't , i do like opera though adn i like classical music , which aparently if played in public can reduce thee base of robberies and assault haha"
12058,"i suppose clqssicla music is n't a genre favored by thugs . i have been o only one classical music concert in dc . they calm audiences can be wild and moving , but my experience was that it was very quiet and subdue ."
12059,"ya it ahs an effect on people , in austrailia they play it in malls to stop kids fro loitering too haha"
12060,icy would see jist drive out the mall rats ! ! ! that would make shopping a more pleasant experience . i hope the silent night opera makes it to the big screen or pbs . i ti san interesting juxtaposition gf an 1918 song mn the 1913 ww1 artistic .
12061,"be i 'll have to check that out , what i crazy is in 2011 a computer composed a brand now classical music song , ai is getting so advanced !"
12062,"i guess ai can compose , but does it have ' soul ' and ' feeling ' ? ai is getting better , but will i every truly master human emotion ? could ai have composes silent night without have human emotion or experience ?"
12063,"threat 's a good question , we will have to see , i want to see tb eli stat can identify classical music just form vinyl records like arthur lintgen apparently can"
12064,"taht is unbelievable ! i would find it hard to believe that ai could accomplish a feat such as turning silent nigh into an opera . even with encyclopwedic knowledge of ww1 , i doubt it could capture the emotions of soldiers from three warning nations temporarily laying down their arms for christmas ."
12065,"speaking of wwi , have you seen the nw peter jackson documentary on it ? it 's called they will not grow old , it 's actually really good he colored old wi footage and has interviews in it , i 'd highly recommend it"
12066,i will look taht up . why do you think that clint nigh composers wanted to commemorate artistic day that occurred more than a century ago ?
12067,"i do n't know , i know that they wanted to celebrate the peace , but i can only imagine , it is crazy that wwi was oven 100 years go and everyone from that war has passed on"
12068,"i wonder myself considering the conflicts ongoing today . apparently fro a reviewer 's perspective in opera was not that good . it , with audiences , in a hit with shows in multiple venues ."
12069,well k will have to check that out and you should definitely check out that documentary i recommended !
12070,"i just learned that jeff bezos built a clock in a mountain , that was run for 10 , 00 years . one would think he would find something else to spend his time in money on ."
12071,9 agree . i can only imagine how much he spent on that . did you see that the first amazon customer got a building named after him ?
12072,"that is so crazy ! i never knew best buy would price match amazon , i knew target did , which you cannon fend in vermont ."
12073,"that 's interesting ! i wonder thati vermont does n't have one . i did n't realize how target got it 's start so many years ago in 1902 , originally ."
12074,i never knew that either . weird that they have n't carried tobacco products since the 90 's .
12075,yes it is . apparently the herbs that are advertised to be in most of the supplements in several stop do n't contain hte ones they advertise .
12076,"caught caught . one would think these companies would take a page cout of lego 's book , and find environmentally friendly alternatives to oilbased plastics ."
12077,legos have been around for so long and continue to be popular . hte company is actually based in denmark .
12078,yep . many think they are a american company . they 've even around since 1949 . neat 's a long time .
12079,"i thought they one an american company too ! just since jury 2015 , 600 billion lego parts have been made ."
12080,i think half of those are in my has . it 's insane how amazon warehouse workers walk km to 15 miles a shift . that 's hard work .
12081,"they must have to he in great shape ! did you know that lego brand is considered , ore powerful then ferrari ?"
12082,"i did , and that lego gave out a 148 old brick to factory workers who had been there for over 25 years . that would be so cool to own ."
12083,it sure would . it sounds like the employees are taken care of well . they are valued at about 100 . 00
12084,"have you been to one of their amusement parks ? legoland is always worth a visit , their stores are amazing , ad you can buy individual bricks ."
12085,"no i have n't , but it souds like fun ! so there are enough lego bricks for every person on earth to own 86 of them ."
12086,i bet the are at least double that in every home . especialy the yard . those things are everywhere .
12087,"ike do , they end up everywhere nd htey 're are very painful to step on , h aha ! it would be beneficial if they can produce a more environmental material to use for all those legos ."
12088,"they are working on an alternative , i was surprised to did out they had a very good effective rate in the planet ."
12089,that is surprising ! did you see where a german graffiti artist painted a bridge that 's 250 sq feet to look like a lego ? that would be a sigh !
12090,i did . some interior decoryorsa re using accent pieces made of legos . mostly in white .
12091,interesting ! i enjoyed our conversation and got an education on several companies . have a great night !
12092,"thank you , you do the sa , e ."
12093,thanks !
12094,"hi , how are youse doing tonight ?"
12095,"nor bad , what do you think about amazon ?"
12096,"aaron does well by it customers , but now so good by its workers . do youse use amazon ?"
12097,"yes . i have heard their warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 miles a day , hat 's pretty crazy ."
12098,i guess the workers must be fit . the first customer got a building named after the . that must be a strange honor .
12099,yeah it had to have been a book because amazon started way as a online bookstore . i wonder what book the person bought ?
12100,"they probably bought jeff bezos autobiography . the man has a clock that will run for 10 , 000 years !"
12101,"haha i hope it runs better than my kind , i had to replace one after 2 weeks but amazon bit me a new one and gave me z free book of my choice so that was nice ."
12102,that great ! they love their customers ! i do n't know about the workers though . they truck a deal with united states postal service to deliver package son sunday
12103,"well teh are certainly better than target , even though target is the 8th largest department store in the us ."
12104,and yet vermont is the only state in the use to not have a target store . isn ' tthat bernie sanders home state ? ernie ! what up ? !
12105,"yeah , they say they will price match amazon but i 'll believe it when i see it ."
12106,i ai n't never tried that ! i bet amazon will da anything to beat a competitor !
12107,"well thay are second in the world in total sa , news after the alibaba group . they are the largest internet retailer in the wild by a decent margin i think ."
12108,plus they own imdb . since 1998 . soon they will own everything .
12109,well it takes something special to have the usps deliver on sundays that 's for sure !
12110,i think they must get time and a half or double time or something . those guys do not work on sundays !
12111,"no kiddie , amazon has gotten so big now , they have their own film and television studio . i patched thee hack brynn show , it was pretty good ."
12112,"tat was good . i think they got a good shot at getting some awards . anyhow , great chatting with youse tonight . i wish you the best !"
12113,you too avoid target !
12114,i will ! i 'll move to vermont !
12115,haha take care !
12116,"i think the classics re a sure bet , what are your thoughs on this ?"
12117,"i trink the classics are a god start if it is measured . with a growing gen x income and nostalgia , te classics are a good start but there a to be new stuff too to create the millennial with a future ' classic ' toy they can buy too ."
12118,"i agree , there must always be innovation , its great how we have access to digital versions of book on single know ."
12119,yeah . i am trying to go all digitals with my books bit there 's something about holding a book that they kindle cant replicate . do you use a kindle ?
12120,"i do use kindle , what about you ? i got a fire tablet and been using it since the ."
12121,i had a fire tablet but now use the kindle app on my ipad . i lo did . i may get a white paper kindle so i can travel with it .
12122,"i think that a great choice , i heard it has a long batterylife so thats good , kind of like the color jeff bezos built on a mountain ."
12123,"10 , 000 years ! great 's a long time . i will never know if it lasts that long . . . did you know they can the partner on oneclick hopping ?"
12124,"i didnt know that was a thing that could be patented lol , and it sure is a long time , i guess we wont be alive to see if its tru e ."
12125,apple payer amazon a usage fee nor the technology . seem like amazon got it right . not sure how you can patent customer service but hey . . .
12126,"jeff bezos is sure talented adn smart , its more than 20 bears and the company seems to have np limits ."
12127,not if he buys up companies like whole foods . i heard they are looking into opening the stores in sears building since they closed .
12128,"i see , that would be a good way to activate economy , an interesting fact is how much warehouse workers have to walk ,"
12129,amazon walks like 715 . i worked in office . warehouse an walked about the same . i was so aired after my shifts .
12130,"i can imagine , 71 fan be a lot but on the other side can be really wealthy ."
12131,i was so disgusting after working in an air conditioned warehouse . not flesh !
12132,"i see , that can be unhealthy on the other hand , do you ever shop at target ?"
12133,i do shop they . do you ?
12134,"i do . , i like that theuy will match the prize that amazon has , so no doubt im getting a good deal there ."
12135,i did n't know that . that 's good news ! i will show here more often .
12136,"you should definitely with it a try , dont buy herbal supplement though as it seems like its a scam"
12137,"hi there , do you use the computer a lot ?"
12138,"i do , i spend most of my time on one each day l but not the kind that can run on waste roar anything cool like that ."
12139,i know we need to ask the russians how they came up with that
12140,"yeah , all the way back in 1936 too . crazy the way technology develops is n't it ?"
12141,of course . do you know why you should not smoke near an apple computer ?
12142,"i 've heard it voids the warranty . i 've never one it , and i 'm no sure how they 'd know if you do or not ."
12143,"exactly , how would they know . re you annoyed by insects ?"
12144,"all he tome ! they are like the place in florida , especially during the summer . how about you ?"
12145,i am not a an either . have you ear doof gold bugs ?
12146,"no , but they sound like the ind of buy i could possible get bind . what do thet do ?"
12147,they breathe in dissolved gold and excrete solid gold
12148,i would n't mind having some of those around . nothing like those wasp that turn ladybugs into zombie babysitters .
12149,my goodness that is every . do you know what glover mines re ?
12150,are they those bugs that you always find in piles of bricks ?
12151,yes an din concrete as well
12152,"i wonder if thos name the same bugs that are in car , the , or red any ep"
12153,i know they were using them in food dyes as wells nd key became a huge issue
12154,"the thought of eating bugs is pretty gross , bu i guess its not too harmful"
12155,i am not sure if it is harmful . corn ot but just hear about it . are you much into science ?
12156,"i enjoy it , but im definitley no einstein ."
12157,neither am i but also enjoy it too . nice chatting with you .
12158,"hi , how are you ?"
12159,i am okay . how are you ? i shop at amazon na lot . do you ?
12160,i do . i like amazon but wish i had more will power not to buy as much .
12161,it does get easy to get out of control do there . did you know that the company was founded in 1994 ? i cant believe it 's been around that long .
12162,"i know , right ? did you know that bezos is getting divorced and his wife and he married one year before he started amazon so she gets half !"
12163,"yes i did hear that . i 'm sure he has a hand in that not working out . i though i heard he was faithful but i would have to verify that . for some reason he built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10 , 000 years . i wonder why ?"
12164,"i thinkk he has a girl friend . the internet was buzz about it but i was n't interested enought to click , on the stories . i would like a building named after me , like their first customer . . ."
12165,ike yard heard thet th first customer has a building and after him . and he only spent 27 . 95 so that 's a good deal .
12166,yeah ! their warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 miles a day . i used to work in a warehouse and you walk a lot !
12167,wow ! that 's a huge warehouse . apparently usps has a contract with amazon to deliver their packages on sundays but i 've never received a sunday delivery .
12168,i think i have but i am in chicago so taht might play a role in it .
12169,i 'm sure itd definitely does . 'm in ohio ut i love chicago . it 's an amazing town . i was unaware until recently that amazon owns imdb . i go there a lot als .
12170,i do too . especially when i har cartoon voice i recognize but ca n't figure out . or refusal actors eat i can not place .
12171,yes i use it all of hte time for the ' where i have i seen that person ' question . do you use spotify ?
12172,i do listen to spotify . all the time . you ?
12173,"i 'm more of a pandora person but i do use it sometimes . it 's crazy to me that an artist has to get 130 , 745 plays per day to an minimum wage on spotify ."
12174,that 's a lot of p ; lays ! ! q seems like the artist got the short end of the stick .
12175,"it does . but on the flip side a band once earned 20 , 000 on the app for a silent album which is mind blowing ."
12176,that is crazy ! i stink spotify just went public . . .
12177,i will have to look into that . i know they have 4 million songs so they should be around for a while and you 'd think the stock would be a good investment .
12178,yeah . that and amazon ! nice chatting with you !
12179,you as well .
12180,"how 's it going ? did you know spiders actually fall from the sky , that 's terrifying"
12181,yeah . it is like the float . scary
12182,it 's crazy that spiders can parachute on long strands of bobbing
12183,"i know , so creepy"
12184,i guess spiders used that method to move onto volcanic islands
12185,"that would be a lot of silk to get across the ocean , but if they float , i guess that explains it ."
12186,"yea , charles marvin claims to of caught a spider that had traveled at least 60 miles"
12187,how would he have known ?
12188,apparently he was on a newly formed volcanic bland an dial able to identify the spider asia n astronaut spider which area and far away from there
12189,ahh . i dont know why so many people are afraid of them .
12190,i do n't know but much can be legend about how they travel through the air which can lead to innovations jhn engineering
12191,i did n't think of that . that would be a neat thing to study .
12192,"yea m spiders and insects can be pretty cool . spiders are n't the only ones who travel in the sky , ladybugs do too"
12193,"there are golf bugs , that breathe in dissolved gold add excrete solid gold ."
12194,"thats awesome , i wonder if themed is any places that have teh gold bugs on display , i 'd go to see them"
12195,id like to own a few . maybe make some extra money from the gold the excrete .
12196,"theres a wasp that burns ladybugs into zombie babysitters , too bad they ca n't change them to go"
12197,yeah . there is a bu tthat an up in red dye 4
12198,"yea and theres bugs i hncarmine and cochineal extract , at least tit 's extra protein"
12199,thats a good way of thinking of it . lol
12200,"wel i got t go , nice talking with you"
12201,how 's it going ? are you into computers must ? they are used in a lot of things such as c9ntrolimg systems and industrial nd consumer devices
12202,"i 'm using computer right now , actually . it 's crazy thay they have so wide range of uses these days sees like they can do pretty much anything humans cna ! no wonder people are trying to upload their minds to them ."
12203,"yea computers are interesting , in 1936 russia invented one that ran off water"
12204,"yes , they can consist of materials other than t metals and rare earth elements we 're used to , someones even guilt on virtually in minecraft !"
12205,"that 's crazy , so is apple voiding warranties fo smoking near theirs computers"
12206,"yes , humans ca shave weird yes , but there must be some scientific reasoning behind it . i mean , that 's how we got computers and the internet in the first placescientksts ."
12207,"yea , the world wide web was invented by an english scientist working at cern"
12208,"yes , the internet was originally for sharing research data . the idea of a scientist is a pretty recent dealt was n't a term until the 1bn century when williams wheels invented it in 1833 ."
12209,"that 's interesting , plus scientists tend to be really smart at a young age . von neumann could divide two 8 digit number in his head . 6"
12210,smart peopel tend to stay that way and remain curious throughout their lives . the emperor of japan i strained as a scientist and continues to publish research today .
12211,"that 's awesome , i wonder what emperor akihito studies ?"
12212,"it would be neat if he studied somethings ha is n't theoretical , like insects ."
12213,"yea insects are pretty cool , there are gold bugs in the ocean that breath gold"
12214,that seems wasteful aha . i guess that kind of unusual use of resources is to be expected them they make up over 90 percent of animal is on earth !
12215,"yea plus they transport themselves through the sky , that 's cray and a little scary"
12216,"i do n't think they have the mental capacity to be scared mean , they can even nd up as zombies like ladybugs who are infected by dinocampus coccinellae wasp ."
12217,"that 's pretty scary , so is eating crushed up bugs with fold that contains red 4"
12218,"yes , and those bugs that actually look red tha the see on concrete ar recalled glover makes , which seem skin of ironic ."
12219,it 's crazy how bugs are found everywhere including oceans
12220,"yes , even though crustaceans ar 'the dominant life form there ."
12221,well both crustaceans and insects ar earthropods
12222,"yes , they are ."
12223,hi hoya re you ? do you like computers ?
12224,"hello there , i do like computers , they are very useful . how about you ?"
12225,"i love computers . they are my best friend . almost . i spend too much time with them . did you know that in 1936 , the russians made a computer that ran on water ?"
12226,"holy cow that is impressive , i wonder what that would look like ?"
12227,i cant imagine that it went very fast thoug hp probably an interesting design .
12228,yeah sounds like i would be . do you know how much ram the space shuttle ' general computer must on ?
12229,the shuttle is pretty old technology . 100k ? 500 ?
12230,i guess 1mb of ram . i dont think that is very much at all !
12231,"that is not much , but i bet the programmers were efficient about memory usage . not like the one of today ."
12232,yeah that is most likely true . did you know that smoking proud apple computers voids the warranty ?
12233,"that is strange , but i guess it could hurt the electronics . what about vaping though ? is that ok ?"
12234,"that i could't tell you , but i can say tha utmost people probably every knew that about the smoking ."
12235,that is true . smoking ? it is not taht uncommon . especially in europe and south america nd japan and china .
12236,"yeah i bet , on a different note , do you know much about insects '"
12237,i dont know much abou insect . they have six legs . spiders have eight .
12238,"that is true , there are some crazy bug alike gold bugs that can breath in dissolved gold and excrete solid gold !"
12239,really ? i have ever seen that ! i heard the gold bug was a story by poe . it can find gold .
12240,yeah stat bug sounds crazy . do you know what those tiny red bugs what usually are on concrete are called ?
12241,ladybugs ? ladybirdrs ? is that wht you mean ? red with black spots ? ;
12242,"no those tiny tiny ones , i guess they are called glover mitres ."
12243,"oh , ok . what about them ? what are glover mitres ?"
12244,"i just never knew what they were called . but a 's been good talking with you , i hope you have a good day !"

12256,i guess people hope to get discovered on spotify ? i wonder how many people actually make it after spotify .
12257,"that 's a good question 2 2 now a musician needs to get 130 , 745 plays per day just to earn a minimum wage !"
12258,that is insane . i wonder how many visitors per day there are . not enough to make sa living .
12259,that is definitely something to look into . were you ever a fan of michael jordan ?
12260,i liked mj . he was an exciting palmer . made big plays .
12261,he really was ! do you know how michael jordan ruined muggsy bogues ' career ?
12262,"ho did he do had ? i know that muggsy was tiny , but a great player ."

12275,yes to make the creepy metallic noises
12276,"yeah to think horror films are inspired by authors such as edgar allan poe , mary shelley ."
12277,do you play any instruments ? i like the violin .
12278,"i like the guitar but trink the violin is a cool instrument as well , i like thas tit has a small size ."
12279,modern violin were preferred over million dollar stradivarius violins when taste don the blind

12299,did you know that the us dod bought 1800 playstation 3s ? they wanted to build a super computer and it was cheaper than actually doing any alternative methods for that

12301,yep i agree . i did n't like how they got rid of linux on the playstation 3 though . it ; s funny that a company executive actually tweeted the unlock code fort he playstation 3 . talk about a mess up haha
12302,yeah it can happen . did you know that they actually made an official linux kit for the ps2 ? when i found out i thought it was crazy to think a company would support something like that so officially . usually consokpesa re very closed systems .
12303,"yes i agree . and that 's why they chose down the linux access , because people were hacking it lol . htey just did n't think that stuff out very well . i think it is cool that the last game for the ; ps2 was fifa 14 , which panned 3 console generations"
12304,it 's wild to think of how long a systems lifespan can reach . i rememebr hearing that someone made a new am end goof it supported through donations and even released a physical copy .

12342,"haha i agree with you . i also like horror movies because teh can burn calories when you watch them , up to 180 per movie"

12346,"it 's na instrument that horror movies used to create that creepy metallic sounds , it makes you feel scared when you hear it"

12349,"no , i played the trumpet mostly but never a string intrumnet , you ?"

12352,"yes , i have a ton of audiobooks . i have the harry potter tseries on audiobook !"
12353,me too ! it 's interesting that audiobooks were originally just so that blind people could ' read ' books but i think they re great for everyone . especially when on the go .
12354,"it 's awesome listening o some of these artists narrating audiobooks . audiobook is somehting of the future , before that was ebooks . i feel sorry for barnes and noble ."
12355,"htey can still sell ebooks if they met he retail experience worth going to . michael jackson made an audio book for et , it 's pretty cool ."
12356,"wells , audiobooks were originally made for blind people . however , with advent or vehicles and mindless driving , , listening t audiobooks are easy ."
12357,"yeah , even just at home it 's nice too . reading paper literature is nice either artistic stories or intellectual information , but it can be a strain o your eyes ."
12358,"however , it 's quicker to read a book than it is to listen to it . you can also take notes , i love posting notes . scifi books are great when i 'm about to hit the hay . i love to read fantasy books ."
12359,"that is true , but i 'm rarely in a rush . take harry potter which you 've mentioned . it 's probably the greatest fantasy book nad the audio books are even better . jim dale performs 300 different voices , and he certainly sounds better then i do in my head ."
12360,"yep . there 's a janitor from chicago who wrote a 15 , 145 page fantasy manuscript and spent over 6 years writing it ."
12361,wow ! and i thought the harry potter books were long . what was it called ? i 'd imagine that would take a long time to read .
12362,"the author was henry larger . it was ' the show of the villian girls ' . i personally never read it , about i heard about it . if you have time , you should read it !"
12363,"i 'm not sure i do , bu ti 'll put it on my list of things to heard . i 'm just bout to start readings poem dungeons and dragons books . by read do course i meant listen to audio books . lots of famous people narrated them ."
12364,who is your favorite narrator for audiobooks ? weird al ? elicia day ? wil wheaton ?
12365,"that 's a tough one o answer . i guess weird al , but it is surprisingly good too ."
12366,icy a n't get past pet as a rapper and tv celerbiyy . audiobook narration by him just makes me think about all the stuff h played in .
12367,"i can see that , but he does such a good job . i hear he 's really into spelling bee 's too among other things . did you know there are fantasy drafts for the national spelling bee ? i bet t is into that ."
12368,lol . fantasy drafts of national spelling bees ? i could see that . such a baller .
12369,people will bet on anything . i prefer fantasy baseball .
12370,i was n't aware you can bet on fantasy baseball . . did you take easy bets on the superbowl ?
12371,"no , not into football . maybe next year though . i think i ; m going to head out ow . i 'm actually going to o to the book store so maybe i 'll see if that have that 15 , 145 page book . i bet it will be here ."
12372,"listen to the audiobook , version , if they have it !"

12380,"i 've never heard of him , i 'm not a big fantasy person"
12381,"also , i heard that a janitor wrote a fantasy manuscript rotating 15 , 145 page s ."
12382,i thought that was kind of sad . i wonder if btw as actually published
12383,"it was only found out after how death . so , he earned nothing ."
12384,"well , maybe he never wanted it published and just id if ifr himself"
12385,are you interested in literature in general ?
12386,"i 'm a big reader in general , but my tastes probably are n't as highbrow a they should we . do you like to read ?"
12387,i used to but i have been busy lately with family and work . i di no know that literature was considered to be an nfl form . do you ?
12388,"i suppose its an art form , it certainly if n't know it was an olympic event until 1952"
12389,i heard that it was an olympic event from year 119 to 1952 . i wonder how it worked .
12390,i 'm going to have o look up more about the fda burning literature in an act of censorship ; . that 's pretty horrific to happen here
12391,i should research mork myself . i wonder why the literature was censored .
12392,"depends on the era i suppose . i 'm going it was some time ago , b ut you never know"
12393,"i just found out that music , sculpture and painting were also included in o , olympic from 1912 until 1952 . why did they decide to stop ?"
12394,probably not very entertaining to watch on tv !
12395,there was no tv though during that period ? am i wrong ?

12472,like the iliad or odyssey ?
12473,yea hose were good although i 'm not a huge poetry fan . apparently poetry has been around since the prehistoric times in africa
12474,i think poetry is a hit or miss . have you heard o far palindrome ?
12475,"yea , i 'm vaguely familiar with it , i 'm just glad i do n't have to write one"
12476,i ca n't even begin to comprehend how demetri wrote a 224 word palindrome andc ow it would be go
12477,i feel anxious just thinking about it . there 's a poem consisting of 800 irregularly pronounced words that is 274 lines long
12478,"one thing i find inspiring is that there is a poem that if read normally is depressing , but backwards is inspiring"
12479,"that does sound awesome , e . it 's interesting how popular poetry is , the vikings considered poetry as a gift from odin"
12480,"despite quality , the authors do n't necessarily get paid much . edgar allan poe only received 9 bucks for the raven"
12481,yea i heard poe diet without such money . tupac studied poetry in high school in baltimore as a teen
12482,literature is kinda like art . many people are only appreciated after their passing
12483,"funny thing is that art , music , and poetry were once olympic sports so it was appreciated more in the past"
12484,"fair 3point . on a side note , do you have any pets ?"
12485,"i do ave a pet snake , non venomous though , although it sould be pretty cool to have antivenom blood like that guy who was better so many times"
12486,"well i guess you could also sell the venom to holes save lives . however , milk , on snakes are extremely dangerous"
12487,"yea , i 'm just glad i do n't live in australia where venomous snakes outnumber nonvenomous snakes"
12488,"indeed . i any case , thanks for chatting ."
12489,"hi , ho ware you ?"
12490,mine . and you ? do you like snakes ?
12491,"um , not really bunch of a stake person . you ?"
12492,"i had a pet corn snake once e , but it died overbite because my house was too cold . i see a lot of them around here when my cats catch them ."

12494,interesting . i knew ther eweereb't any in ireland or hawaii .
12495,the fear of snakes is hardwired not only in ulman brains but also in monkey brains . were you ever afraid of your corn snake ?
12496,"no , i ' v never been afraid of snake si mean , 'm afraid of them intellectually if i know they 're venomous , but i enjoy handling them . are you afraid of them ?"
12497,"generally , i have a healthy respect for them . thanks for using the word venomous . many people say poisonous , but that 's for things we eat , or shouldnt eat ,"
12498,"i do n't think ive levers even a venomous one , except at zoos and the like . i see a lot of black snakes and grass snakes here , and they 're handy for keeping down rodents that bother my garden ."
12499,there is a genuis of flying snakes that ca launch themselves at prey . have you er seen any of these ? sounds terrifying .
12500,i never heard of them before . i wonder if they just use their muscles to launch themselves strom against the ground ?
12501,"i only care if they 're venomous ! and if they 're out bothering my garden . the organs in a snake can be one in front of the other , instead of side by side . makes sense ."
12502,i used to have a dog who was terrified when i pulled teh garden through the grass lol .
12503,i 'm sorry ? pulled he garden throught he grass ? sounds rather poetic ! car you a poet ?
12504,"nah , i meant pulled the gardens pose heaedesk . but snakes are actually good for gardens they eat the rodents that feed on green stuff ."
12505,"i do n't the sakes , i just ahve a wariness around them . i stay away from them k they stars away from me . they can eat all the rodents they want . hey can hve my share ."
12506,"my cats love touring them , unfortuantely ."
12507,"i have similar attitudes toward cats as snakes . i am indifferent . cats looks t me , i look at the . i will scratch their heads and we them if they do the same for me ."

12528,"awesome . iv ' e seen bits and pieces on tv , but there was one scene tht made me turn for the tv ! there is just so much blood . . . , it was a bathroom scene ,"
12529,are you talking about the bathroom scene from the original movie or from the new one ?

12535,"i know , i have n't seen either , were they both pretty good ? which one it you like more ?"
12536,"hard to read , i think i liked the first one better , but tey were both really good . i didnt even realize that the movie is based on 1960 lol that funny , they have so much technology in the one . in the sequel we finally see the baby 's powers ."
12537,"oh really ? i would have been have guessed that , i guess 13 years does n't seem too long then ?"
12538,do you like any disney movies ?
12539,"i do , i really liked the lion king , it was the first disney movie to e translated to zulu for an african release ."
12540,ohh yeah that was a good one ! greats use as well . have you seen they are doing a live action movie of aladdin ? thee cartoon was so good .
12541,"i saw that , the blue will smith ? or , that 'll be good . hey 're definitely not recycling their animation frames like they did in the 70s ."
12542,"lol yeah , robin williams was the perfect genie though !"
12543,"for sure , rip robin williams , it 's unfortunate he gets so much flack , he must have felt so much pain in his life that it was that unbearable ."
12544,"i know , its so sad . it seems common on comedians . you never know waht they are really going through because they cover it up with jokes and stuff ."
12545,"for sure , it is really sad . it 's terrible then when people just go after them all hate on them been they 've never lived a day i their shoes ."
12546,"exactly , you cant judge , you just never know ."
12547,"for sure , could you imagine watching wreck it ralph in the 1980s thoug h ? that 's whe they started developing that movie ."
12548,"thaat wouldve been amazing honestly , i really like tha movie . hard to believe the started developing it ten ."
12549,"for sure , w hat was the movie about ? that 's some vision to start hat in the 1980s ."
12550,"it was about a video arcade and at night teh characters woul do able to leave their game and socialize in the circuit . but of course , there a few characters that try nad cross over ti other games for various reasons and things get crazy ."
12551,"oh wow , i think i should go see had . i saw it on fortnite , so it 's kind of like toy story ?"
12552,"kinda like toy story , its really creative . they second one was not as good ."
12553,"oh dang , i have knew there was a second one out yet . i 'll check them out , thanks or the recommendation . i am going to take off though , great chatting and have a good rest of the night !"
12554,hello . ' incredibles 2 ' sounds like a lot of fun . what do you think ?
12555,i only saw the first one but i know that they are set in the 1960 's shih is interesting .
12556,"that would be interesting to me , since i was a college kid in the 60s . it 'd be fun to check out the cars , airstyles , clothes , etc ."
12557,i 'm sure . i did hear that 13 years before the sequel came out there was a video game form o it sequel .
12558,did you play that video game ? i wonder ow it compare duo hte movie . is that im took hook off the underminer ?
12559,id id not . i do n't know much about it that from it exists . do you enjoy disney films ?
12560,"oh sure . the original disney walt was a genius . the company has an amazing record of films , animated and not ."
12561,they definitely do . did you know that th lion king was the first disney film translated into zulu ?
12562,"really ? that 's quite interesting ! i guess that would be appropriate since the lion king , watch i love , is african ."
12563,it does seem appropriate . apparently in the 70 's the company recycled a lot of frames so you will see the same ones in other movies .
12564,"i guess theres a lot to be said about recycling , then . anyhow , i 'd like to take my tepgrandsons to see the incredibles 2 . they 'd enjoy it ."
12565,i 'm sure they would . dod you take the to see frozen ?
12566,"no , their mom did . i saw frozen on tv . i like got . i gues some kids see is over and over ."
12567,yes they do . it was so popular . that 's good because it was the first animated disney film directed by a woman .
12568,glad to head toast . hollywood does n't have a great record of women directing films .
12569,i agree . hopefully a shift is happening on . disney makes a lot on merchandise . the toy industry gets involved before they even begin filming a production .
12570,"i suppose i anything would be hand in glove , it would be toys and popular movie for kids ."
12571,"most definitely , off topic , but do you find bird interesting ?"
12572,"yes . i love in the sticks in kansas canda m greatly cheered to see a bald eagle every once n a while . they are incredibly graceful , even kid of awesome ."
12573,they are . i you know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs ?
12574,"those rascals ! well , maybe the hummingbirds find the designs attractive and just cant ' help it ."
12575,ha ha . they do it to repair their nests which . quite smart .
12576,"halo there , do you follow politics much ?"
12577,"yea , i did n't know the term congress originated in the middle ages"
12578,"i did n't know that either , that is very interesting . do you know who the only nonhuman to testify before the is ?"
12579,wasnt ' tit elmo ? i wonder what he was testifying about
12580,"yea goods all ! i remember seeing hat happen on tv but forgot why he did , or what he was testifying for i mean ."
12581,it 's pretty cool that congressmen have their own exclusive subway lines
12582,"i did n't know that , i wonder how fast it actually is ."
12583,well those subway lines must not be too fast
12584,"call , good one ! do you know what year the first woman was elected to congress ?"
12585,no but i heard he first woman was elected before they had the right to vote in a national election
12586,"that is true , and it wa sway back in 1916 i guess ."
12587,thank god they did n't have a fantasy congress bc then
12588,"i think i read that before that there is a fantasy draft for th congress , count me out ."
12589,"yea , i would n't want to draft red sr blue on any of my fantasy teams"
12590,"no , or have to do research about those people , not my idea of fun at all ."
12591,i find it ironic tat 15 percent of the tea party identifies as democrats . sounds like they ar every conflicted
12592,that is pretty funny . did you know that ronald reagan campaigned for the games ?
12593,"lol no , he also campaigned against high corporate profits and low wages"
12594,"yeah is n't that funny , i feel like politics and politicians never do what they say or do the reverse ."
12595,it 's a shame there has n't been a nondemocrat or republican as president since 1853
12596,"that is a shame , i think it would be a nice change of pac metoo et somethings different in there ."
12597,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
12598,"hey there ! are you a soccer fan ? i do not watch a lot of it , but i do watch all of the world cup ! i am excited for 2022 in qatar !"
12599,the fifa world cup ? i really an it familiar with it . i only learned a bit about it in school . i 've forgotten what fifa even stands for ' as the last cup exciting ?
12600,fifa stands for the federation international de football . it was exciting even with the us not in it .
12601,"oh , i remember now . is it sort of like having olympic games ? in the once that it 's international teams competing ?"
12602,"yes , nad riot is every four years since 1930 except for 1942 na d'436 because of world what 2 ."
12603,every four years ? fifa fans has such a long suspenseful wait between big games ! i wonder if hey have smaller yearly tournaments as well ?
12604,teh govern most of soccer aside from the world cup .
12605,i wonder if fifa makes al ot of money from merchandise being sold like shirts and hats nad things ?
12606,i am sure they make a ton of money . i hav hard they are even corrupt . th said thing is no host company has ever had any economic gains from hosting the world cup .
12607,that 's not fair . maybe a least the heat o keep money from concession stands at the fifa cups ?
12608,"they meet get to , but the cost of the infrastructure to host the world used just be ridiculous ."
12609,have you ever seen the old uniforms from cia cups years ago ? they look pretty different from today ! especially their trousers .
12610,"haha l , yes . the word trousers is an important distinction because in the uk the word pants usually meant underwear !"
12611,thats ' pretty funny ! i just hear don the news the other day how many s children are watching a british pig cartoon and they 're kicking up the british accent and style . they probably call pants trousers !
12612,"haha , that would be hilarious to have my daughter just randomly talk in a british accent !"
12613,"it 's amazing what trends people wil ; click up on . in example , i heard there ways a style in china for gang members to wear as many shirts as they could and have the collars popped . must have been very hot !"
12614,"haha , that is so ridiculous ! i much prefer the hawaii business attire of an aloha shirt !"
12615,do you remember billy mays that oxiclean tv infomercial guy ? at his funeral blue shirts and khaki pants were worn bt the pallbearers just like he 'd wear in his infomercial .
12616,"i remember him , that is a touching tribute ! speaking of shirts , it is crazy that th polo shirt was originally invented just for tennis !"
12617,i ' v always wondered when we came up with necktie for mens ' shirts . they were like kind of a dangerous edu a .
12618,"haha , no kidding . they are a pain to wear . wish we never ad that idea !"
12619,"did you know that , hammer 's pants were the model for aladdin 's pants ? i would have thought it was the other way around !"
12620,"5th time a fun fact , i have heard that before and it makes sense . they look so similar ! i think i am going to listen to some hammer now , it was great chatting with you today !"
12621,sounds fun ! i actually new to get my self some new trousers me jeans to be exact . ttyl !
12622,frances mcdormand was very progressive in her best actress acceptance speech .
12623,it was powerful and a punch in the gut to the folks who in the oscars and the committee
12624,i think so too or she seems like a very strong persona .
12625,were you a fan of hers before the oscars ?
12626,i do not thik i 've seen ny films with her . i will hav tv watch some . which other movies is she i n ?

12630,"that 's a wonderful book . i have not seen teh film , though ."

12632,okay i wo n't . did you ever see black panther ? apparently back panther might be the richest super hero .
12633,i did n't but was curious to watch dorothy steel to see the 91 year old actress everyone is talking about
12634,she is in that find ? i do n't recall .
12635,i also wanted to see forest whitaker and lupita as i am a big fan of theirs
12636,"i think they could have been used a little more , but the cast was very strong , l overall ."
12637,do yiu think it ill wen any oscars ?
12638,"bo , i do n't think so . maybe for production or something ,"
12639,did you know denzel paid teh tuition for the main actor in the movie ?
12640,"i did not know that . is it michael b jordan ? or the black panther , himself ?"
12641,chadwick boseman . he was denzel big time . . . lol
12642,"oh , i think that is black panther . wonderful chatting !"
12643,i think its great that minufuare horses are welcomed as service animals
12644,me too ! i wonder how many actual service animals are recognized since the are over 20 quintillion animals on the planet .
12645,"20 quintillion animals wow ! ! ! thats a lo t , and i bet many of them are service animals ,"
12646,do tigers cout as service animals because in asia mork tigers are pets than wild ?
12647,"maybe they do , that would ; d be interestin , domesticated animals develop white patches on their foreheads , i bet those tigers have the mark"
12648,probably ! can you imagine a country basing more pets than kids under 15 ? japan has that . . .
12649,"thats crazy ! thats mores han a pe ther household ,"
12650,yup ! even theodore roosevelt had 20 pets !
12651,"20 pets ! he had a zoo at home lol , i wonder what kind of pets he had"
12652,i knit he had a bear and a hyena .
12653,can bears and hyenas even be domesticated or even be legal to have s pet ! ! ! out of teh 20 quintillion animals a million are insects
12654,i doubt it ! i do know that cats are domesticated and that 's funny is h first clones cat was named copy cat ! lol !
12655,"that is funny im more of a dog person myself , here are cat cafes in taiwan and japan , they must really love cats over these"
12656,"i lie dogs ore too , but even d o n't like dogs enough to let one be my mayor like they did in talkeetna , alaska with a cat !"
12657,i head mayor stubbs died ! i bet he did a better job than many politicians in ou country
12658,i wonder how he even got on the ballot ? ! i wonder how he ever got anything done since a cat that lives for 15 year thas spent 10 of the sleeping ?
12659,i guess it started as a joke but then it really catched on and he ended up winning the election many funny things happen ba accident like te cat in the godfather 1
12660,very true and the loch ness most being a protected species even though some do n't believe he 's real !
12661,"i dont think nessie i isreal but its nice to know he is a protected species , nessie must be part of a rare specie"
12662,i dont ' think he 's real either . germany also loves their animals because hey favre them constitutionally guaranteed rights . nice chatting with you !

12671,me too ! george strait was great back in the day ! apparently he is jeff bezos cousin
12672,yes . i read that somewhere . that is a very interesting fact . do you know from where country music took its roots from by any chance ?
12673,o do n't know that actually
12674,it was from folk and blues music which is surprising to me .
12675,i could see folk but not so much blues . tat is interesting to say the least . henry ford i thin khan a part in country music becoming popular
12676,i agree . i think he helped financing its popularity . is that correct ?
12677,"yea , because he had a fear over the urban decadence of jazz music . . . ."
12678,ha ha ! ! that is both funny and interesting at the same time . do you know how many african american are in the country music hall of fame ?
12679,"i only know one african american and that is darius rocker , s o maybe not many ?"
12680,they are just 2 african americans in the hall of fame .

12698,its is more comfortable to wear . it absorb the sweat very easily in the summer period . its is suitable for booth hot and cold climate .
12699,"nice , i think they were created for tune lacoste tennis play . i wonder why they chose polo"
12700,the business man use suite and tie for tune professional meeting . it makes very neat and comfortable and give gentle look .
12701,"that ankles sense , i ca n't stand the business look unfortunate . tool classy for me ! did you hear what theuy wore at billy mays funeral ?"

12709,i do not . i hear an oscars inner talked about i tin her speech though
12710,yeah . i wonder what she was referring to ? it looks likes h eis helping the smaller roles on films .
12711,its to router biases on casting . . i still dont think i understand all taht it means but if you are making millions who can complain
12712,it is more about the extras and crew get represented equally in terms of reap demographics .
12713,"on another note . wa , t disney holds the record for most oscars wih ww2"
12714,that 's q lot 3d daniel daylewis has 3 !
12715,eminem has oscars ? ? ? for what ?
12716,"8 mile soundtrack . best original song , i think ."
12717,"well he has more than leo , johnny depp , will smith , george lucas and bill murray combined . im not sure ny of theme ve haven n oscar"
12718,"leo got one for the recent , right ?"
12719,did he ? maybe that was his first ? i know george didnt get any or star wars but his wife kids for the editing
12720,that 's nuts to me . i wonder if e was nominated ?
12721,i dont think so but it not for sure on that . the oscars are the oldest worldwide entertainment awards show
12722,did you ever see black panther ? i feel like that should have been nominated .
12723,i actually couldnt but into it . i feel like it was nominated for something . did you know black panther i richer than tony stark ? !
12724,i did not . i kknow tony stark is rich so lack panther has to bed loaded !
12725,5000 billion . toby is a mere 80 billion lol
12726,that ca n't even get you a good place in nyc ! how can he olive ?
12727,ha ! chadwick boseman was accepted to a premiere school and couldnt afford it k an anonymous bendfactor paid for it . . turns out to he denzel
12728,that 's so kind of him . nice chatting with you !
12729,how would one bring a mini horse on a plane as a support animal l ?
12730,"some of those miniature horses are small , bu they 'd seem to still take up a lot of space on a plane . 9 would not want to be next to one ."
12731,no particularly because i 've been around horses . if it is n't trained properly hat is going to be one foul smelling plane .
12732,that crossed my mind too . a hockey would be of concern for me too . eventually a line has to be draw .
12733,yeah i can see dogs and maybe even a cat but when it evolves into strange animals i thnk it is okay to say no . i get it is their support but there has to be a link or everyone else 's safety .
12734,"snakes too , it reminds me of that movie a few years back , snakes on a plane . maybe i could take my service elephant on my next flight ."
12735,lol they might bad at that a bit . it is not a popular opinion i 'm sure bu ti think that there should be laws about what constitutes a service animal and it should be limited to certain animals fdr pulic safety .
12736,"agreed i know there is the american with disabilities act , and it has to be honored , but you how to think of everyone else went making decisions ."
12737,so true . i think everyone is so scared of offending someone that we are allowing things taht area bust butterfly ridiculous .
12738,"my laughter would love a horse , miniature or otherwise . it 's just not in our budget ."
12739,horses do tend to get spendy . espeically the miniature versions . when you get a mini version of something they are inclined to health problems becaue of the breeding tha thas been done . they also don ' tend to live as long .
12740,"i it not know that , sounds like you know a bit a about horses . do you have pets ?"
12741,i have a couple dogs but we had a horse growing up and we knew lots of horse people including a mini ereader . i do n't think he had them as emotional support animals though .
12742,"there 's a famous adverts from britain featuring a scotland pony . it became famous for about a weeks for doing a moonwalk or something , faked of course ."
12743,nice . they can do so many cool tricks if trained properly hey bother to fake something like that ? do you have pets ?
12744,"kids have rabbits each , and we have a small dog . my daughter come home then day and said she wanted a snake , we compromised with the rabbit ."
12745,i could n't have a snake . i do n't mind them outside but inside would be a hard no from me too . rabbits are nice . quite a docile pet .
12746,"we lotr really lucky with the rabbits , they put up with a lot from the kids . my wife used o breed them when she was young and did them for 4h ."
12747,there are some beautiful rabbit breeds out there . it is always fun to walk through the building at the county fair and see them . i would n't mind having an angora .
12748,my daughter wants to train her ever sine few saw a youtube video of rabbits leasing a fences obstacles purse .
12749,that would be so cool to see . it has to be easier to do that trying to take a cat like you see a bunch of people on youtube doing .
12750,are you a comic book fan ? ? i am a huge fan . dis you know disney bought marvel in 2009 ?
12751,"no , i did n't know that ."
12752,marvel started in 1989 . stan lee and jack girly created fantastic four and many others .
12753,"cool , did you see black panther ?"
12754,"yes , it was great ; sony had a chance the buy all of marvel 's cinematic rights for 25 million . however they trend it down and only bought the rights to spiderman for 10 million . big mistake ."
12755,"wow , did you know that black panther is the richest of all the superheroes ?"
12756,"man , i did n't know that . i did know that there is one character owned by both marvel and dc . his hame ks access and his whole purpose is to keep both company universes separate ."
12757,cool . did you see avengers infinity war ?
12758,"yes , i have seen all the marvel movies . i heard that marvel created a superhero specifically for a 4 year old named ' blue ear ' because the boy was uncomfortable wearing hearing aide s ."
12759,what wa 'the superpower of the blue ear superhero ?
12760,that i di n't know . but the boy told his mom that ' superheros do n't hear hearing aids ' so marvel created one .
12761,"oh , did you know that according to marvel mutants karen ot humans ?"
12762,i have read that before . yum mentioned infinity war . that was the first movie ever shot entirely with digital imax cameras .
12763,did digital imax cameras make the movie look better and if so why ?
12764,"that , i do not know . i am not that knowledgeable . jarvis , who is in the iron man films nd avengers is never actually seen on screen , only his voice ."
12765,interesting . what are the infinity stones in the mcu ?
12766,when the universe ws created it was broken up into 6 infinity stones that were all powerful .
12767,"oh , did you know marvel comics used to be called atlas comics ?"
12768,"now that , i did not know . i did know that black panther was not named after the black panther party . hte comic character actually predates the founding of the party ."
12769,fascinating . what other marvel movies ks chris evans in besides avengers : infinity war ?
12770,"well , i will leave you it this . chadwick boseman , who played back panther a accepted into a prestigious summer theater program at oxford university . i dope you halo a great new year ."
12771,"hello , do you know much about congress ?"
12772,"i know a little bit abou congress . i know that there are three subway lines that re exclusive to u congress members , thats pretty crazy"
12773,"i think taht is amazon , and so convenient or them not to haver to take public transportation ."
12774,hes i agree with you . i also know that the democrats and republicans plan annual baseball game . they 've been doing it since 1909
12775,"nice , taht seems line its just putting fuel to the fire lol"
12776,yep i agree with you ; and republicans are jp by thee points haha whig is definitely something that they will keep in mind wheat hey'rem taking laws probably lol
12777,and right !
12778,there 's also people tha too fantasy congress ? i did n't know that because you would think there was only fantasy football . but people make a fantasy apart out of anything i guess haha .
12779,yeah ive even heard of fantasy spelling bees lol
12780,"haha i guess . also weird is that elmo testified before congress , heist he only nonhuman person od o so , so i assume that he did it in character lol that 's weird"
12781,"that is read , i wonder why though . i hope its on video somewhere lol"
12782,"aha i must be on youtube somewhere . pretty cool though that the first woman wa selected to congress in 1916 . that means that she was elected before any woman had the right to vote , so even had voted her in ."
12783,that is pretty cool .
12784,think about the democrat party by the way ? the modern democratic party was founded in 1828 by supporters of andrew jackson apparently . i did n't know that
12785,there hasnt been a us president who wasnt a rep or dem since 1853 !
12786,"not that 's a long time ! it 's also interesting how the parties have shifted in their ideas over time , for instance l ronald read used to campaign was a democrat to rally against highs corporate profits and lower wages"
12787,yeah . did you know 15 pecetn of the tea party movement identified with democrat
12788,"no i did n't know that ; that is interesting though . i also did n't know that the colors of red ad blue were not typically used with democrats nd republicans , that is a moe recent invention"
12789,"yeah e either , i thought it has always been like had lol"
12790,do you1 watch the simpsons by teh way ? fox news tried to sue them because they were making fu do them . what fox owns the simpsons i thought ? so how would that work ?
12791,yeah i used to love the simpsons . thats hilarious .
12792,have you seen back panther ?
12793,"hello there , i have not seen it yet no . i would like to though , how about you ?"
12794,"i 'm interested too . hes supposed to be the richest superhero in the world , richer than bruce wayne . of course , is batmans really a superhero ?"
12795,"yeah i had heard that , i am surprised there is a superhero tha thas more wealth than bruce wayne ."
12796,"well , walt disney has enough money to buy marvel , so they are probably richer than everyone else involved ."
12797,yeah that is true . did you know they briefly changed the name to black leopard air one point ?
12798,i did not know that . i thought it had something to do with the black panther party .
12799,"yeah i think that is why they changed it for a short period , because they didn ' g want people to be confused ."
12800,yeah . i do ' 5 think globalization was a black panther platform . they probably advocates more isolationist or separating policies .
12801,yeah you might be right on that . are you a fan of marvel comics in general ?
12802,i liked marvel when i was a kid . i recently saw a clip of sober downey mj playing iron man . ac dc was the background music ll dogs great .
12803,"yeah he plays the iron man character in all the movies ? i have n't seen them , but know that he does ."
12804,"marvel has so many superheros . i heard they created one , blue ear , just for a single fan ."
12805,"yeah i thought that was really cool , i think he is a deaf charater that uses hearing aids ."
12806,i like the villains too . dr strange is quite the intellectual .
12807,"yeah i have only heard good things about that one , but again i have not had a chance to se it . and yea h , i think they have to make them just as good as the heroes ."
12808,a lot of people like killmonge r the russia directors do a good job with a variety of characters .
12809,i have never heard of that one but sounds very interesting . what is your favorite villian of all time ?
12810,danny veto 's penguin . but m'baku evolving into a villain seems interesting .
12811,"nice 2 yesh he was awesome in that , there are some scenes that i will never forget with him in that character . politics at its finest ."
12812,i woul advise staying offline to avoid spoilers . they are everywhere .
12813,"haha i think you are right . well it was juice talking with you today , i hope you hav . nice day ."
12814,do you know films ?
12815,"i do , i like to watch movies , do you ?"
12816,i do too . i recently enjoyed spiderverse and black panther
12817,"black panther way a great movie i really liked it , hope there 's a second part ot the firm ."
12818,well the marvel movies ware a progression of the more stones
12819,"did you like the leading actor , chadwick boseman ?"
12820,i think he is doing well
12821,"he is a great actor , fun fact about black panther but he is actually the richest super hero out there"
12822,"well while bruce wayne and ironman own companies , black panther own sa country"
12823,yeah that kind of cakes sense still bruce wayne was like the richest hero surprising to hear his not .
12824,i still fell batman is the rich superhero
12825,"i guess 80 billion is a lot of money , do you like tom hanks ?"
12826,"ya , why ?"
12827,"he i 'the highest all time box office star , he has earned a lot of money over the years ."
12828,that is pretty cool . would you rather be nominated for the oscars a dozen nor so times and never receive it or just even be nominated ?
12829,i woul like to be nominated . can be really frustrating but in the end being nominated would make me grow as an actor what about you ?
12830,"i guess i agree , but being nominated so many times , but never winning would still be a bit depressing"
12831,"it would be depressing , yeah , just like the movie trojan wars and their box office of barely 309 after a 15 million investment ."
12832,lol true true . well box office does n't accurately indicate the quality of a film
12833,it doe n't many good films ha da terrible box office like sleeping beauty or treasure planet .
12834,"true true , but both are films that are core to my childhood . in any case , thanks for chatting ."
12835,hello ! how ar eyou today ?
12836,i 'm doing good . what about you ?
12837,"same here , just watching a movie on netflix . do you like watching movies ?"
12838,"i do , and unlike a lot of people i like the oscars . did you know tbh oscars were nominated for 9 emmy 's in 2013 ?"
12839,they must have not had many other nominees back then lol . it seems like walt disney would have won since he 's one o many in his life !
12840,big 'm pretty sure walt has 22 oscars under his name .
12841,that is a lot of oscars ! it 's funny to think eminem has more oscars than some super famous people .
12842,does he really ? like who ?
12843,"he has more than johnny depp , leonardo decaprio , will smith , george lucas , nad bill murray combined !"
12844,wow ! that id pretty amazing . ahve you third of the movie blazing saddles ?
12845,"i 've seen it , i is a funny comedy . you do n't see many comedies t the academy awards though ."
12846,"well , surprisingly that one has been nominated fo i oscars !"
12847,very cool ! have you seen the movie black panther ?
12848,"i have not seen it , but i 've heard about it ."
12849,that won a lot of oscars his year . i enjoyed watching it for sure ! he 's considered the richest superhero .
12850,"yeah , i 've heard he was an estimated wath of 500 billion ."
12851,that 's so much more than tony stark 's 100 billion . just give me one billion of that and i 'll be happy lol .
12852,i woul did too . the marvel comics carter black panther was not named after the bake panther party .
12853,did n't he predate the partly itself ?
12854,"yes , that is correct ."
12855,"i 'm going to look more into the movie . i enjoyed chatting , have a great day !"
12856,hey there did you knw that gov . employers ave their own personal subway in washington dc ?
12857,i think i heard hat before . it makes sense for safety reasons . it ? s actually three different subway lines
12858,"ya its a good idea , weird that us congress does baseball ga , is every year , and i guess republican are up by 3 overall"
12859,"'s 's america 's pastime , and it 's good camaraderie . plus , f or s tradition to be going on for 110 year , that 's not much of a win difference"
12860,"'s hopefully it heals their differences , would you ever play fantasy politics btw ?"
12861,"i ca barely keep up on politics , though some who have a strong interest in it would find it fun . a woman was elected to congress before she had the right to vote"
12862,that is weird ! that jean stat men voted her in !
12863,"exclusively men . maybe many of them were tying for change as much as women were . that , or maybe her names sounded masculine . they did n't have television back then for everyone atl be familiar with faces"
12864,"ya thats true , did you hear about the only nonhuman to testify before congress ?"
12865,was n't it elmo ? i wonder how that worked considering he 's a puppet
12866,"haha ya i do n't know it seems dumb to me , like is it also or the puppeteer really testifying haha"
12867,exactly . what 's interesting is that the term for congress goes as far back as the late middle ages . taht 's a lot time ago
12868,"wow ta time a long time , do you like the democrat party ?"
12869,there are good and bad things about both parties l apparently the simpsons are antidemocratic to the point that fox threatened to sue them
12870,"ya that is weird , but yes kind of crazy that red and blue only started being used for dems and repubs in 2000"
12871,thats probably when campaigning game a big deal . it 's less weird than the fact that the name was originally he democraticrepublican party
12872,"ya that name just would confuse me haha , weird too that 15 percent of tea partiots identify a thye democrats"
12873,"i 'm not even sure what the te apart movement is supposed to be . for one 150 year snow , all presidents ahve been either republican or democrat"
12874,"ya that is a long tim e , weird too taht reagan campaigned for the democrats back i his younger years"
12875,he was against low wages and high corporate profits . who knows what canoes took place between then and when he became president
12876,"ya , do you like jazz music btw or i kow that clint eastwood does"
12877,i like it in small doses . ans i like music that ha jazz elements added to it . the thats ' why he was even interested in million dollar baby
12878,"hi , d o you like marvel comics ?"
12879,i would n't say tha ti 'm ino thee comics som ucjvb ut i have enjoyed the movies . i know a little about the comics .
12880,"same here . in 1998 , marvel offered its movie rights to almost all of its characters o sony fo 25 million ."
12881,oh wow ! that was a mistake . i ca n't imagine how much those movies have made combined . have you heard of the superhero blue ear ?
12882,i have not head of blue ear . which character is that ?
12883,marvel created the character just fdr a young boy who was uncomfortable wearing the hearing aids that he entered and stated that superheroes do n't wear hearing aids .
12884,wow that 's pretty amazing . wish more companies did acts o kindles like that .
12885,i agree . it was incredible nice of them . ; did you now that weir issac dalton is i teh marvel universe ?
12886,i did not know that . that 's pretty cool .
12887,i agree . he was one sorcere5 supreme white is the same time given to doctor strange .
12888,very cool . do you like the avengers ?
12889,i do .
12890,o saw that the infinity war movie was the first film to ever be shot entirely with digital imax cameras .
12891,oh wow . i did not know that . infinity war is very good . did you kno wthe the for who plays jarvis has never seen the films ?
12892,really ? does it say why he never watched them ?
12893,no i have not heard why . i have heard many actors say they do watch her own movies becase they of too critical on themselves ! perhaps that 's why .
12894,taht ' really odd . i saw the waitress captain america saves voiced gretchen in hte recess .
12895,i did not know that . that 's very interesting . did you know that robert downey jr hid top on the avengers set ?
12896,i did not know that . does it say why ?
12897,he does not bt nobody could find his hiding spots and when he is eating blueberries on screen it 's unscripted and part of his stash .
12898,it was great align to you !
12899,"hi , how ar eyou ?"
12900,"hey ! i 'm great thanks , how re you today ? have you ever seen avengers : infinity war ? it 's the first film ever to be filmed entirely with digital imax cameras ."
12901,i have seen that love . i really like it . did you see it ?
12902,"no i did n't . i 'm not really into superhero movies . i have n't seen black panther either , t he other marvel comics superhero fil m ."
12903,i really liked black panther . he is the highest superhero !
12904,yeah i kno w ! richer than bruce wayne who has a net worth of 80 billion . i do n't even know what i 'd do with 1 billion .
12905,i would find a way to be happy . . . his estimated wealth his t 4050 billion !
12906,"i thought otherwise , but back panther was n't need after the black panther party . th comic actually predates the group ."
12907,the symbol sand written script are n't made up ? they ars actually based on actual script call nsibdi . it dates back to the 4th century .
12908,"that 's interesting . i know too that marvel censored ' praise hanuman ! ' because they feared it would lead to backlash ,"
12909,did you see chadwick boseman was accepted into an oxford program an could n't afford it but denzel washington paid for him to go ?
12910,that 's admirable . denzel washington ! i actually just watched the movie american gangster last night . and boseman did n't get to that denzel i person until 20 years later at slack another 's premier .
12911,wow . that 's really nice . did you know t voices actor who did jarvis for the iron msn series end avengers has never seen the films ?
12912,"ba maybe he ' so a fan of superhero movies like me . are you a fan of marvel comics ? they 're responsible for so many superheros . daredevil , ghostwriter , the hulk , magnet , etc . . . ."
12913,i do like them but i do not go out of my way tow at them . i feel like htey have saturated the market with them .
12914,agreed . it 's crazy that they offered their cinematic rights to sony for only 50 but sony rejected it and bought spiderman for 10m .
12915,seems like a lack of vision om their part . do you know how shawarma is ?
12916,maybe . . is it a type of food ?
12917,i am not sur . i do know the avengers caused an increase in its sales . . .
12918,"hmm . i got ta look that up haha . did you know lou ferrigno , who played he hulk in the 1960 series , s till voices the character rand has been for decades ?"
12919,i had no idea ! nice chatting with you !
12920,"hello , how are you ?"
12921,i am good ! have you seen teh movie ant man ad warp ?
12922,"no , i have n't . have you ? sounds interesting ."
12923,no i have not either ! paul rudd is in it . do you know who he is ?
12924,"yes , i like him . he 's a good actor . do you watch boxing matches ?"
12925,yeah he is ! jo o do not
12926,boxing matches have to breaks so they do n't do something wrong and to not keep pounding each other .
12927,oh really ? they are called rounds karen ; t they ?
12928,"yes , next spring the fought avengers movie comes out . have you seen any ?"
12929,yeah . . . just saw infinity war and it was relaly good ! did you see t ?
12930,"no , goo duo know , i want to se that . do you like marvel comics ?"
12931,yes very much ! some of the movies are redundant though ! taht 's cool the lou ferrigno has even doing the voice of hulk k !
12932,"yes , i agree with you on that . walt disney company acquired marvel entertainment ."
12933,"yeah , is aw that ! seems like they have been doing a good job with the movies ?"
12934,"yes , but they do n't have the rights to the movie big , xmen nad spiderman ."
12935,oh . . . i did no know that ?
12936,i love taht they made a movie recalled blue ear about a 4 gear old with jarring issues .
12937,"awww . . . that is awesome and thoughtful ! see , there is one character that is owned by dc and marvel ? i wonder who it is ?"
12938,"i know , i do n't know . the boy told is mom , superheros do n't hear hearing aids , so marvel created one . great chat ! !"
12939,too bad sony did't buy all the marvel characters ? lol
12940,"agree , have a great day !"
12941,thank s !
12942,youth soo .
12943,are you a fan of antimen ?
12944,"i 've heard of him but have n't seen that movie . i did see black panther , though ."
12945,did you like the black panther movie ?
12946,"i thought it was kind of ridiculous , but that 's how i feel about superhero moved sin general . i think the theme of isolationism vs global revolution sent a very mixed message ."
12947,"yu dont like sup4rehro movies ! ! we are on a different page there lol , but i see your point"
12948,"i think i was more significant for providing a vehicle for black actors , like the 91 year old woman who made her big film debut as a tribal elder after sending in an audition tape ."
12949,"real ; y i never paid attention to he r , waht er name do you know ?"
12950,"dorothy steve l ; she began acting at 88 . seems like a very late start compared to chadwick boseman , whose education at a summer theater program bt oxford was funded by denzel washington ."
12951,"denzel washington really did that kid a solid , maybe u can appear in one of the black panther movies in a future , tha would be interesting to watch"
12952,he 's almost old enough to be a tribal elder at this point haha . he certainly could find a role in any of the marvel franchises 's pretty lucrative for a studio that had to use its ip as collateral when securing funding from ferrell lynch .
12953,"yeah , his an also that would fit in the franchise perfectly , a nd wht abou infinity war did you watch the first part ?"
12954,"i did not see that , but i heard a lot of big names like robert downey jr . and scarlett johnson were in it ."
12955,"yeah mark buffalo , chris evans , don schedule , chadwick boseman many great actors , the cast is crazy even dave baptist is a hero"
12956,i hard that robert downey jr . would actually guide food on set and actually used hidden food in scenes . bind of gross but funny .
12957,"that isp funny well h eis like the leading actor of them all so i guess his entitled to anything ,"
12958,"yes , although it seems like there 's a wide scope of behaviors allowed in the studio ; the voice actor who played arts in the iron man and avengers serie shard never even seen the films !"
12959,"never really ? that it unusual , another funny fact is how the shawarma sales went up lol"
12960,"i guess people are pretty easily influenced , although sometimes it 's the other way around ; marvel actually created a ne superhero just to a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable with wearing hearing aids and whose mothe that told him that superheroes do n't wear hearing aids ."
12961,"thats admirable , creating a hero to help a kid . trouble , o yu know the name of that superhero ? i have to look him up ."
12962,"its name is blue ar , which is probably on the same level of creativity as antman . some people re less than even that creative , though ; michael jackson tied to bey marvel so he could play spider mon in hid own movie !"
12963,"taht crazy thank god he didnt buy hte franchise that would be terrible , he would ruin the hero lol"
12964,"yes , i wonder how he would 've felt about black panther ; maybe his sister will be in the next few with angela bassett . nice chatting !"
12965,"avengers : infinity war , sounds like quite a movie . have you seen or heard about it ?"
12966,absolutely ! its a great movie ! they are coming out with a sequel to it this year !
12967,so these movies ace a continuation from a previous one . i know the marvel characters are highly popular .
12968,sort of . most of the marvel movies are touched in infinity ar because all of the characters make an appearance .
12969,that is interesting . i imagine teh sequel coming out will be a very popular movie . do the same actors play in each movie ?
12970,"no . sometimes ant man will make an appearance in captain america movie , but not all of them are in every movie . infinity war will be super popular because th first one was left with a dilemma . its a grea tseries you should watch it !"
12971,"i will have to try and watch it ! sounds quite interesting . i read that the characters had a falling out in the captain america civil war but they will work together , as the need for help is ther ."
12972,"yes , a huge falling out , the group was divided . si is an interesting fact : when robert downey jr . was on the set of the avengers hew would hide food on the sets . nobody was ever able to find it so they let him continue o do t . the screen swede he is eating blueberries ana shawarma are unscripted and a part of the collection of food that he hid ."
12973,that is an interesting fact . i had not heard that before . now the infinity stones are a part of each movie . each stone is a different power or something and here all 6 of them .
12974,"not each movie , they are more show is infinity war . a stone has mad ah appearance in dr . strange and ion man and i think galaxy of the guardians . but yes each stone has a different power ! i dont remember what ethic power is , except one is the power of time ."
12975,sounds like a fantastic ideal . tha stories are a bit sci fi as well as superhero then . i did not know lou ferrigno as voiced one of the characters . i remember him from the hulk sow bake i nthe 70 's .
12976,"right ! i cant remember which character though , which is funny because someone else plays the hulk in the marvel movies , mark buffalo"
12977,"yes , he played the hulk in the tv show wand bills sixty played dr , david bruce manner . i did not realize that is the same hulk character that mark buffalo plays in the movies ."
12978,"yes , it is . ? he plays bruce manner and i think the voice of the hulk . tha hulk disc a . hes great ! really has that awkward o smart gum thing down ."
12979,"i read here that the avengers caused an increase in shawarma sales , is that some kind of food that htey eat ? i never heard of it ."
12980,because of the fact i mentioned earlier lol . robert downey jr eats it in one or two scenes lol its a greek dish if i remember .
12981,"lol , yes he unscripted food scenes you mentioned . of course . have you seen the balck panther movie ."
12982,"yes , ive seen all of the marvel movies . black panther s another great one !"
12983,sounds like an interesting one as well . i guess i have been missing a lot not seeing all these movies . do you know when the next may be coming out ?
12984,"all i know is it coming out this year . you should get started on the marvel series now , thats a lot of movies ! !"
12985,"lol , it certainly is . i will have to watch all the time in order to catch up before the new one comes out . well that you for filling me in on all the information , it has bee wonderful chatting with you !"
12986,have a good one !
12987,do you watch the olympics c ?
12988,"yes , i am a big olympic fan . john wall came in 16th . this is probably his last olympics ."
12989,yes he wrote about that in a bit . i think he came back though .
12990,"oh , he did . i did n't know that . are you a soccer fan . did you watch the fifa world cup ."
12991,i did not . which teams played in that game ?
12992,"well , a ll of them play in teh world cup ? there have been 21 world cup tournaments ."
12993,i hear there still looking for a location for he 222 qatar fifa world cup .
12994,"not exactly . however , teh city that is set to host the 2022 qatar fifa world cup does not exist yet ."
12995,"the hungary national football tema only phd one defeat between 1950 and 1956 , and that was the world cup final . do you like his team ? who 's your favorite ?"
12996,"they are ok . my favorite team . the us . speaking of that , an american tema has denver placed below third place in the world cup since 1991 , the year the women 's world cup started ."
12997,"that 's awesome ! i hear that the championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930 , except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because og the second world war ."
12998,"that makes since . you mentioned 1930 . tat year , the us got 3rd place ."
12999,i guess is just an honor to had the game because there are no net economic gains for h countries that have played host to the olympics or the world cup
13000,"changing topics a little , i am a fan of awshio0n . did you know that during the cultural , revolution , in high , gang fashion involved layering as many shirts as you could and popping their collars . weird"
13001,really weird ! did you know in hawaii youd o n't have to wear a suit and tie to work .
13002,"good , i hate suites and ties . i saw there a judge in d . cs few a small dry cleaning business for over 67 million . they lost his pants . what a jerk ."
13003,"67 milllion , thats crazy . sometimes i think we put to much emphasis on clothing in this country . did you know she wedding dresses you or as much as 10k"
13004,"yes , i did know that . here is something that i wish every city would do . ' saggy ; ants ' are against the law in collinsville , il ."
13005,yes please no body abba to see there underwear . they should make them pull their trousers up !
13006,i ca n't stand being kids where them bagging so that they saddle . w funny fact is that aladdin 's pants were supposed to cook like mc hammer 's pants .
13007,"treat 's to funny ! in the united kingdom , the bored pants generally means underwear and not trousers ."
13008,"well , hte want thing i will ; say is that people wear pants because of horses . in the army back in the you , when riding horses armies wearing pants were more effective than those wearing robes ."
13009,good to know i gain i lot . thanks for talking with me .
13010,thanks
13011,hello ! do you like am music ?
13012,"i am a big fan , but being from new orleans where jazz originated , its almost a requirement ."
13013,that 's awesome you 're from there ! i would love to see those street musicians ! clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz fan .
13014,"its root combines africanamerican music traditions , along with brass bands , friends quadrilles , ragtime and blues"
13015,interesting ! a woman from harlem has held jazz concerts in her apartment every sunday for 20 years !
13016,thats cool . i did not kno what pakistan has s jazz group which is topping th charts !

13042,"yes , he is popular in awhile series . he is multi talented person ."
13043,"yes he is . he actually scored she , movie he also produced , million dollar baby . have you seen it ."
13044,"yes , cool jazz developed at the early of 1940 introducing calm , smoother sound and line melodic clones ."
13045,"could , there is a jazz orchestra in pakistan at is currently topping the charts . guess its still in"
13046,there is a programming language i which the programs are in the medical composition . in the early stage its very difficult to compose jazz music .
13047,i believe it . i dont think i could do i ever if i tried .
13048,"jazz is a for of independent traditional and popular musical styles , jazz is cahracterizedb y swing and blue note s , call and response vocals and improvisation ."
13049,a also has roots in west african cultural adn musical expression .

13054,y dog is watching me .
13055,ominous ? should i call someone for you ?
13056,"no , he just keeps an eye on things . in case of snacks . you an never tell when i will call snack time . he is a lot more fun than a pet frog ."
13057,i bet . what kind of dog do you have ?
13058,he is a shelter dog . mostly black lab ; but something in there brings the crazy . do you have pet animals ? are you ailurophile ?
13059,i am not . i am a cynophile . i just put my st bernard down last month . she was 10 and lived past her avg ge . she was great .
13060,"big dogs are fun , but short on time . i might be allergic to cats ."
13061,"i alma allergic to dogs , which i found out when my st bernard was like 2 . did n't stop me from loving her though . i have 2 cats nad hate en of them , and tolerate the other ."
13062,wow . i like the idea that a 15 year old cat has spent 10 years asleep . if only i could do that .
13063,would you ever ge ta pet bear ? rosevelt had one .
13064,"no , no thanks to the bear . i think it is great that people have such a variety o pets . had ah poster as a kid . some people would count a horse as a pet ."
13065,"i hope this does n't come off as callous ut when people have a tiger or bear as a pet , i have no sympathy when they get attacked by it . it 's a bear ! it does bear things , like all people and his . did you hear about that girl who fell into a cage trying to take a selfie ? ."
13066,"yes , a jaguar i think . beautiful animal . it survive harmed . there were some days a few years ago where a gorilla was shout o get the kid back . thought call ."
13067,"harambe , right ? i find the girl to be incredible dumb and nothing should happen yo the cat . just poo judgment ."
13068,"yes , harambe . it was poor judgment . i know of a kentucky token called rabbit have , t heir mayor is a dog . i ses that a town in alaska that a cat for a mayor . i wonder if they trade post cards . sister cities and all ."
13069,i do n't think . they do n't get along . they fight like can and dogs .
13070,"right , that is always a risk . i have never had a cat . it is said htey fight , but really , does it not depend . did your dog care at all but hte cats ?"
13071,not relaly . every once in a while she would let them know she was big but that happened infrequently . the young cat would play right with the dog 's tail and the do was completely indifferent .
13072,"i think that most dogs woul learn to tolerate what they can not catch . if i were a paper , i would like my dog as a coauthor . i think he would like that ."
13073,neat would be nice . i think he deserved it .
13074,some one around here deserves something . tale it easy out there .
13075,morning . do you like cats ?
13076,"i 'm more of a do iverson , but cats are cool . i hear there are cafes in japan there you pay hourly go drink and hang with cats ."
13077,do that would be fun to see . the life of the cat seems nice . do much sleeping .
13078,"yea , by thet in a cat reaches 15 years old , it ' spent about 10 years of its life sleeping ."
13079,lucky cats ! have you eve seen teh godfather ? the at in the opening scene was found on set .
13080,that 's cool . i love the godfather . no wonder that cat is our stress in the scene . there 's a town in alaska thats had a cat name stubbs as mayor since 1997 . wonder if it has its own office ?
13081,i bet it does here are not many people in alaska ! such a unique name too . . . talkeetna .
13082,"speaking of cats in odd positions , a physicist once published a paper with a cat as coauthor so he could write king the first person plural ."
13083,that is pretty ingenious . that way he would n't be criticized . i like his style !
13084,the first cloned pet was actually a cat . can you guess its name ?
13085,interestin gf was copy cat ! very caved !
13086,l ; have it ! did you know there are more tigers living gas pets in the us than living in the wild in asia ? that 's nuts .
13087,that is sad to hear . maybe ebay roosevelt had oj ? he had a bear and a hyena !
13088,"a et hyena sounds like a really , really bad idea . there are more pets in japan than there are children under 15 ."
13089,"wow those japanese love their pets ! apparent ; y in boulder colorado , it is illegal to own pets ."
13090,what ? that seems crazy ! wonder if there are ways around that law ?
13091,"oh now that you ask , yes i believe they just actually say you can be a poets ' guardian ' and it is basically the same thing !"
13092,too funny . germany became the first country in the world to give animals legal right guaranteed by the constitution n't probably ca n't call the pats there either .
13093,"yes good point . i wonde rift germany allows all pets ? the reason i ask is because there are so many pets like rabbits , ferrets , pigs , gerbils , hamsters , chinchillas , and many more ! well i really enjoyed chatting with you this morning ."
13094,"yes , me too !"
13095,i am gon na go look up pets online ! have z good one !
13096,"do you like to , music ? i have it but i suppose that makes sense since i am from appalahcia which is one of the women of folk music !"
13097,i love all country music . i drew up listening to it .
13098,"that 's great . there are so many sub genes and different origins for folk styles , from america to europe so really there 's probably something for everyone , even if they have different tastes ."
13099,i think steel guitars ave o ; new up some new avenues for all kinds od music for sure . i thas a unique sound
13100,"it totally , there is this one alternative ' shoegaze ' band that i like that utilizes tele guitars for a nice dreams tone ."
13101,i love that . pretended to be a country band and no one noticed .
13102,there definitely must be a crossover between those heres .
13103,oh fo sure . they both have their roots in the english ballads i feel .
13104,it 's also funny because guitars like teh fender stratocaster were designed for country music specifically but i know that that 's a popular guitar among punk and indie musicians .
13105,ad we always think of the violin as such a classical instrument but it is included in so much of country music that it is iconic .
13106,i think that combo of electric and acoustic guitars is such a classic across many genres now too .
13107,very true . i ave a hard time with george strait and jeff bezos being cousins though
13108,"i know , that 's so weird ! i am always hearing abou famous people wo are surprisingly related ike that ."
13109,right ? ! they just seem to be polar opposites .
13110,"seriously , that 's true . but i guess success comes in many forms since they 're both doing so wel for themselves ."
13111,very true . i think ; people still have a enigma about country because of its hillbilly roots .
13112,"if so i think that 's simply because people fail to understand th rich , deep history of the genre they thing it 's all about modern day redneck behavior but these re genres that were born years a hundred years ago at east ."
13113,very true . it has woven through blues and rock .
13114,"so true ! but then again , ' country ' was the most listened to rush hour radio gene just about ten years ago ."
13115,musical tastes change so much in such a short is . it is goo thoughopens peoples eyes to the world around them .
13116,"it can almost be a lot sad too . i just read the other day that hip hop or rap is now overwhelmingly the most popular genre in the us now , which i am not a fan of , but i gues technically it 's like modern jazz ."
13117,i would much rather have vintage jazz . there is something unsettling yet beautiful about the musical arrangements .
13118,"hi , do you like ; pets ?"
13119,"bet , i like to stay pets , also his pets and cats ."
13120,did yo know in fact the first cloned pet was a cat !
13121,"was , i did not know taht ! crazy ! i even like to believe in the ocen ness monster , lol . ya know the scottish put forth provisions to protect it in 1912 ."
13122,"wow , protect a roster ! ! that is so funny . . . nd just so you know the name of hte cloned cat , is copy cat !"
13123,"oh geez , copy cat ! that is too funny , there too story both sound fiction even though one is n't . ya know there are 2 quintillion individual animals on planet earth , with us ."
13124,"that is so cool ! i do animals , i just read da little more time to study all of them ! hahaha did you now is illegal to own a pet in boulder , co ?"
13125,waht its illegal to own a pet . how can that possibly be ? t hat sounds crazy .
13126,but they say you can be the pet 's guardian . . who can understand that ?
13127,"oh wow , okay , i see what you mean . its word games . i was noticing that is japan there are more pets than children !"
13128,"wow , how could this eb ! adn i did learn that there are more tigers that are living as pets that living a wild life i asia ! !"
13129,"yike , tigers do n't seem like ideal pets ! our former presidents roosevelt had over 20 pets while he in the white house ."
13130,"wow ! he loved animals , wonde what kind of animals he had ?"
13131,"he had a bear , hyena and many other random animals . i guess he loved the , lol"
13132,"wow , even wild animals , he should have moved to africa ! did you know about the cat cafes in japan ?"
13133,"goo 3point 2 ! yeah , what the heck was eh thinking ! cat cafes , oh boy ?"
13134,"you pay to play with cats and have drinks . . i would go out of curiosity , what about you ?"
13135,"hmmm , i am allergic to at so i would run from a place like that . lol . i recently found out taht when a cat reached 15 yrs old it has slept 1 years ifr its life already ."
13136,"wow , they are serious sleeper ! did you know a ca nwas armed mayor in a town of alaska ?"
13137,"haha , no that is weird ! i was able to visit there once its a town called talkeetna , alaska . the cat is named stubbs and it been mayor since 1997 . very remote and odd ."
13138,"do , so cool you visited there . maybe 8 am going myself to check k sometimes . it is so cool to talk abou pets and animals , they are great !"
13139,"yes , thank you for the great chat and have a wonderful rest of your day ."

13147,"some of our family used to live in spain , so we just grew up loving the team ."
13148,"that 's awesome e ! i lived in blegium when i was little . never thought to check if the had a team , thoug h ."
13149,haha nice . yeah so we have been watching hem for awhile . i 'm not a huge soccer fan though .

13157,lol shows how much i keep up with soccer .

13163,"j watched i and loved it i also like the netflix series , too bad they go cancelled"

13165,"yeah they get cancelled its a shame , i really liked them d yea h , marvel had dominated the superhero market for over 10 years , i have the cast , the directors ,"
13166,"i have heard that the villain in the movie is pretty col , thanos"
13167,"yeah a great villain hte hulk had no chance against him , it was humiliating , but no spoilers"
13168,yeah i heard he was much more powerful than the superheroes and it makes the movie different because usually superheros come out n top .
13169,"i like how robert downey jr acts , he is so funny iron all is my favorite hero , do you have a favorite one ?"
13170,"i like the punisher , i think because he does n't really have out of this world super powers ."

13172,i have not watched that yet . i have not even watched bleak panther which i hear was a big hit ! he 's the richest superhero .
13173,"you should really watch that one as well , yeah he has more money than bruce wayne adn tony star , k combined and then multiplied"
13174,yeah . i thought the script i have seen relating to back panther was mad ep . it turns out it is based on ancient script .
13175,"btw as , wow , habitat is amazing , the actor of the movie is also really good , chadwick boseman is his name"
13176,i guess he got his break with the help of denzel washington !
13177,"yeah denzel paid for his dedication , that was a read thing to do , he must be really grateful because of that"
13178,"yes , cool be got to thank denzel in person at the black panther premiere ."
13179,"hs role in infinity wa nwas awesome , maybe denzel can become a hero for teh franchise one day"
13180,so was there a lot of shawarma eating n infinity war ?
13181,"i think its because of the first movie and the ending scene , heroes gather in a shawarma place ."
13182,do you have a favorite disney movie ?
13183,"too many lo frozen , little mermaid , m moana , lion king , aladdin . how about you ?"

13187,"yeah i know , i have only seen like in disneyland , those things ar hard to find ! is sometimes see teh mini movies but i really lke looking for other movie characters in the movies , when they kinda do a special appearance lol"
13188,"did you ever see them movie flubber ? it 's been so long since i 've seen it that id o n't remember much , but bill new as the science consultant for the movie"
13189,i actually never seen that movie . . my good ?
13190,"it stab robin williams , s you kno wit 's going to be funny . another funy one i like is big hero 6 . they had to use a 55 , 000core supercomputer to render that animation"
13191,that movie was really good too ! i ad no idea it was so hard to make .
13192,i know ! since mouse is still one of my favorite classic characters though . her named is actually short for minerva mouse . minnie is more catchy if you ask me
13193,"that makes sense , i never knew that . mickey is my favorite . did ou hear there is going to be a star wars land in disneyland ?"
13194,that would eb so epic ! i would go just for tha be it would also be cool tos lee the headquarters though since it 's such a big leader in american animation

13196,"it in i read that in a book recently , actually . i have n't been on that ride yet , b ut it would be fun to go"

13198,"no , i have n't . i had teh choice to a few years ago , but chose to do six f , all instead . i also really enjoyed e san diego zoo , especially seeing all the species of birds"
13199,i never been to the san diego zoo but i hear it hazing .
13200,"when i wen t , there was a peacock walking around among the visitors . j 've heard that most birds ? feathers weigh more than their bones because their bones are so hollow"
13201,o how that is weird lol ugh i cant imagine my bones ewing hollow .
13202,i lave ca n't imagine what it would be like going without sleep when migrating from alaska to northern mexico
13203,have you seen horseback riding ? they ar mamma with wen odd number of toes .
13204,"yes , i have ! a few times at camp , what 's about i though . i 've always found the to be fascinating animals though . did you know dalmatians used to protect nd calm horses ? that 's why they 're associated with fire fighters ;"
13205,"where did you go to camp ? i went to highlander in nc . we rod normal horses of today , as opposed to 4555 million years ago when they were a small multi we animal ."
13206,"i went to as special camp in missouri for kids with asthma . all the counselors had ' inhaler ' necklace judy the case . yeah , horse back riding was one o the activities available . it 's funny , w tv all my allergies , id id n't have any problems with the horses ."
13207,colin eastwood was allergic o horses . must have been a pain for all his movie roles with horses .
13208,"he probably had a bunch of alleged or something on set . poor guy ! it 's weird , d o you know there are horses that are born black and brown but turn completely white bout six years in their life ?"
13209,i have heard of them . i believe they are all lipizzaner horses . white horses are rare .
13210,"yeah , i wonder if anyone ever saw one in the forest and though a branch was a horn , thus given birth to the idea of a unicorn ? be an interesting idea to research i think . . ."
13211,i would love to research how nature gave birds the ability to lay hard shelf ; led eggs . they have a high metabolic rate . i assume from the all the exercise of flying .
13212,"yeah , they have all sorts of interesting adaptation for flight . did you knw their bones are so hollow taht their feathers weigh more than their skeleton ?"
13213,"that blown my mind ! it is unfortunate the dodo bird is extinct , as i walk love to se tone in person ."
13214,"weird , that it 's part of the family of pigeons and extinct , considering how ubiquitous pigeons are in a lot of our major cities !"
13215,pigeons are everywhere in disney . i love visiting and looking for all of the hidden mickey images .
13216,"i 've never had the honor of going to end of the disney places , bu would love to do so someday . i ca n't believe how much stuf they own , marvel , star wars , you name it , it 's like they 're trying to take over he world ! : ,"
13217,you must visit ! it 's so fun ! go see minerva ' minnie e ' mouse in orlando !
13218,"oh , is that her lol name ? i did n't know that ! did you know they named walle as a reference to walter elias disney ?"
13219,thats ' a sweet shout out to walt . they should name a character after his brother roy too .
13220,"i 'm sure they have , somewhere . . . it ' amazing to think how far disney has coke since it was starting in 1923 . they 're even rolling out there own streaming service 2"
13221,i hope they do flubber on their streaming service . i love the accuracy due to bill nye 's consisting work .
13222,"lots of cgi in that movie . . . speaking of cgi did yo know it took a 55 , 00 core supercomputer to render all the artwork in big hero 6 ? makes eswnsew hits all the visual effects in that movie !"
13223,that was after great movie . nice chatting with you q
13224,hi . do you enjoy riding horses ? apparently th horse evolved over hte past 4555 million years from a small multi toed creature !
13225,"wow thats crazy ! you 're right theyve been around for a long time , humans first started domesticating them back in 4000bc"
13226,wow surprising . there are oven feral populations of horses but most consider the przewalski horse thye only true wild breed .
13227,"thats interesting , also interesting that clint eastwood was allergic to horses , he rode so many in his career"
13228,oh wow that would make work rough ! highschool students once got suspended for riding their horses to school !
13229,"lol thats funny , i love dalmations and i always wondered by they were associated with firehouses , i gues the would calm the horses down back when firehouses used horses"
13230,yeah that is interesting . i wonder if they calm the icelandic horses who actually have a fifth speed in addition to the 4 that traditional horses have .
13231,"wow thats cool , the extra speed is called the tolt , i wonder why other horses a n't now at that speed ?"
13232,yeah good question . i always thought it was funny how horses are afraid of birds . birds are so sad land lighttheir bones are even hollow !
13233,that is crazy ! birdsare d3lii9us btw i just ate some chicken ! its amazing that htey range in size from cm to almost 3 meters !
13234,yeah they come in al shapes ! they cna even fly from alaska to mexico without sleeping !
13235,"wow that is a lot of time , can you believe there is a species of bird that uses spiderwebs o make their nests , that is hard core !"
13236,yea hit is . there are even birds in australia who mimic the sound of a camera !
13237,haha i would be more terrified that they can also mimic th sound of ac chainsaw ! that would scare me silly at night haha
13238,yes food point ! a lot of birds eat mice . actually minnie mouse is short for minerva mouse !
13239,"wow did n't know that ! i also didnt know that the pigeon is closely related to the dodo bird , maybe we can use them to help us clone dodo birds back into existence"
13240,yeh good idea . that would be a funny disney character a dodo bird ! bill nye actually worked with disney on the flubber film !
13241,"haha wells hats interesting , lord you see the movie big hero 6 ? apprently teh created it on a 55 , 000 core computer , which sounds like a supercomputer to me !"
13242,oh or never seen it but maybe i should ! apparently there are ' hidden mickeys ' in all thigns disney and there are a lot of people who strive to find them lol !
13243,"haha wow sounds like they have too much time on their hands , also did you know that walle the movie was named after walter elias disney ?"
13244,oh no i did n't no that ! disney has comes o far from simply starting as an animation company .
13245,hey the . so i was looking at some info on voting that was pretty interesting
13246,did you voted during the midterms ?
13247,"i did indeed . rather important elections as of late , e h ? ' di doyou ?"
13248,i did as well . i was hoping the democrats would have taken the congress too .
13249,"well , they did make jinroads and the one that ot in seem to be a fiery progressive bunch . so i have hope . did you know that astronauts get to vote from space ?"
13250,i always wondered how they are a to do that . by what mechanism to they use to cast their secret ballot
13251,"the iss i sa heck of a polling station to get to . : , fortunately many methods of collecting votes are allowed"
13252,voter suppression is still an issue im many states and it is frustrating to see what some will do to keep people from voting
13253,it seems like there 's only one party tht has surprised voted . they 've completely disenfranchised 34 percent of the black male vote in alabama for instance
13254,very sad . suppression was alive and well in georgia and north dakota as well .
13255,"hopefully we keep making progress i congress and turn some of this around . : ,"
13256,i ca n't believe that the congress is not listening to its voters and holding them hostage with thai shutdown
13257,"i 'm not surprised that the senate would finger the will of the people , sadly . i am had that they are being exposed for doin so more lately , though . we need to have elmo testify before congress again ."
13258,constityunets need to contact their congressman at the subway line and hae a chat with them on the way to the capitol
13259,"oh , i 'm sur they have te subway line well far away from where any constituents could ever reach it . but , i do agree hat people need to speak up more . ca n't keep letting the extremes dictate things just because they 're the loudest ."
13260,congress was stating his weekend thati hey may be close to a few to reopen government .
13261,house has already passed it . senate an pres are sitting on their hands . wo n't go anywhere until they cave .
13262,but ten we will have to hope the president does n't change his mind again and suns the bill .
13263,"he 'll have to check o see what vladimir putin wants him to do first . i 'm sure they 'll start it out . in the meantime , i think everyone blocking progress should have to wear a dunce cap while in session ."
13264,i should start my own fantasy congress league to track the performance at it closer each week .
13265,my fantasy congress has passed national healthcare and free college . definitely fantasy . : p
13266,"i agree , great platform !"
13267,"i did n't know tthat astronauts could vote from space , did tou ?"
13268,"well , if a chimpanzee can receive enough votes to come up third in a mayoral election , i guess anything is possible ."
13269,that 's true . it 's also ridiculous that people in austin texas actually voted to have their garbage dime name fred durst .
13270,"i thinkk hat 's hilarious , and was surprised to learn that jfk voted against the civil rights act ."
13271,"that 's pretty surprising since his brother , bobby kennedy , was very procivil rights ."
13272,"they were so different on many things . not surprising , alabama seems to do alabama thins , adn keep the ban on interracial marriages , even though hits unenforceable ."
13273,"yes , it 's also surprising to discover tht 34 percent of black men do n't have the right to vote in alabama . tha seems odd ."
13274,is that due to felons not having the right to vote ?
13275,"i 'm not sure of the reason . it would seem unlikely that 34 percent of black men in alabama are felons , though . in the uk , all men did n't have the right to vote nuntil 1918 ."
13276,i never knew steven color went to congress to defend agriculture visas for immigrants .
13277,"i had no idea he did that , either . good for him . i think it s strange that elmo testified before congress ."
13278,ashton kutcher testified before congress af ew years ago . he is very involved in stepping sex trafficking .
13279,that 's interesting . i wonder how he became involved in that cause . i figure he would be more involved in causes surrounding pediatric hart disease .
13280,"im not sure , i think it was a random thing that he found when he was on the night shift when his daughter wa sa baby ."
13281,"that 's interesting . sex trafficking is a big problem around the world . it 's something hardly anyone ever discussed , thoug ."
13282,"it needs mores attention , since most of these ' runaway ' girls are probably in the hands of sex trafficked ."
13283,"when i was a kid , i love to read novels about runaway will . i 'm not sure what my fascination was with it . one of my favorite books in junior high was , ' you ask alice . ;"
13284,i 've never read the . did you see that facebook as doing psych experiments during the 2010 congressional . elections .
13285,nothing surprises me with facbook 's activities . i feel like it is a a big mind anne . . . trying to ' figure ' peope out .
13286,"one woudl think they would know it much about people by now , as there are many ways to cook an egg , thats what the folds in a chef 's hat represent ."
13287,that 's funny . i didnt know that . i have a family member who is a sound chef . j will have to impress im with my newfound knowledge .
13288,"i impressed mine when i told her that the fur hats russians were are called ushanka . she did n't kno that , and grew up in ukraine ."
13289,thanks for chatting with me this evening .
13290,"hey there ! do you follow politics closely ? k have to for work , but i get sick of it ! it is important to vote though . astronauts even cast votes from space !"
13291,i follow a bit . did you know tha us congress has played a republican vs . democrats baseball game annually since 1909 ?
13292,"yes , i did the practice for that last year was where the shooting of the congressman occurred . ad story , glad he survived ."
13293,"yes , i agree . can you imagine that elmo is the only nonhuman to testify before the us congress ?"
13294,"i find that hysterical ! it is also hilarious thaat in austin , tx others changed their garbage dump to be named after fred durst !"
13295,that is crazy ! did you know that indian goverment sets up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for a single voter ?
13296,every vote sounds ! that is why it is sad to here that in alabama 34 percent of the black male population can no longer vote .
13297,thay is a some . i 've heard that it all em in the uk had the right to vote until 1918 !
13298,crazy stuff ! i recently learned there was a fantasy league for congress where players draft congressmen an diet points for legislative success . icy annoy even imagine ! ! !
13299,that would actually be pretty fun . there are even three subway lines exclusively for congressmen to move between teh capitol and house and senate offices .
13300,very convenient . i can not imagine the hats they donner in congress back in the late 1700s and early 1800s . i bet they were outlandish !
13301,"i agree . until 1998 , british politicians had to be if top hat if making a point the order in the house of commons . i wonder if a hat maker made that rule ?"
13302,"haha , keep the profits up ! speaking of hats is think it is funny the most popular hat in the old west was hte bowler has . everyone just assumes cat is the cowboy hat , myself included !"
13303,"yes , that is exactly what i would have thought too . i know in the past hats were an indicator of social status ."
13304,i play and watch a lot of golf where tipping the cap is very popular . dd you know that tradition dates back to knights s ?
13305,"no , i did not , why did they co that ?"
13306,they would raise their face visors to show friendliness .
13307,"oh , that makes sense . did you know there wa sa law made in 1908 about the length of at pins ?"
13308,i have heard that before . they though they could be used as weapons right ?
13309,"yes , t hat is the exact reason . fears thay suffragettes would do just that ."

13341,"exaclty , good point . do you know where gotham city is located ?"
13342,i think that it is in new jersey right ?
13343,yes it is . joker and batman do not call the name of each other in confrontations
13344,k wonder if tha nwas planned or a coincidence
13345,i have a feeling it is staged . maybe there is a message behind that
13346,"perhaps . contrary to batman , how do you feel about superman ?"
13347,il ike the movie actually . do you know how much dc paid to get the right
13348,do you mean the right to the character superman ?
13349,"yes , the right ?"

13356,"sounds like he was getting treatment for alcohol addiction . hopefully , he recovers ."
13357,"yeah , addiction is never good and i am concerned for his well begin goo"
13358,i 'm surprised his ex drove him to rehab
13359,she is very compassionate person . i 've like her for a while . i eis a genuine actress too
13360,too bad the paparazzi gets involved in these serious matters .
13361,they truly lack compassion for celebrities
13362,do you remember his relationship with gwyneth paltrow after she ot the oscar for shakespeare in love ?

13369,"yeah , that is why i was sad to see them divorce"
13370,they have tried to parent add ahve discussed that openly with others . they train friendly it seems too . i wonder if they will ge track together ever .
13371,ben was the worst of the batman actors manly believe
13372,i always liked adam west . i never saw his batman log on his molars though lol
13373,he alas truly teh best as well as michael keaton
13374,"i enjoy the classic actors , especially carol burnett was hilarious . she was the first celebrity to appear on sesame street . superman was a classic too i enjoyed , but i did n't now that the writers came hp with the word ' brainiac . ' that ? s funny ."
13375,"i have yet to see the black panther film , but the facts lasted the interesting . i did not know the history behind tv film and did n't know it was based on a 4th century script ."
13376,fascinating ! i do n't follow movies . i thought it was about the black panthers .
13377,haha ! have you watched disney movies ? m y favorite is sleeping beauty and i was disappointed to learn it failed at the box office
13378,"yes , i watched a lot when i was a kid . i prefer the ones with animals . i was interested to learn that the lion king was the first to be dubbed into zulu for its african release . i wonder how it was received there ."
13379,lion kin in another one of my favorites . it is always interesting to see ow different cultures respond when movies lord fashion use their culture for influences .
13380,"yes , it is interesting . did you know that there were a lot of identical scenes in 70s disney movies because they recycled their animation frames ?"
13381,some people have noticed that references and posted abou tit online . i can not believe the film wreckitralph which has been out for a few years started i nthe late 1980 's
13382,yes ! it 's amazing . i havne't seen it yet .
13383,"i had to do an aviation project doin a claws in college and it took forever but you would think technology would make it a lot faster , as disney has a large studio . i have yet to see the movie"
13384,me too . i wonder waht the animation process is like today .

13386,"yes , that are time of the ; big six ' ."
13387,do you1 now the other fire of she big six ?
13388,"i do n't . o just know that disney has a number of subsidiaries , including pixar , and they work closely with the toy industry during the production process ."
13389,"same , which were stated in the article . the toy industry and companies do a good job of not being out the new characters or movies ."
13390,yes . its amazing considering how many people must be involves .
13391,"sadly , i must admit frozen is another favorite disney over and was played to learn it was directed by a woman ."
13392,yes . i 've heard it 's good . i 've mostly just heard about it from kids so far .

13400,yeah that is pretty sexist . did you know blank panther is the richest superhero ?
13401,"i did no know that , i bet it would help if he put some money back into the movie industry in america ."

13403,i do not know . who is i t ?
13404,"tom hanks , he is great"
13405,"i agree , so many great films over the years"

13407,"i am glad they did n't , do you remember john carter ?"

13422,did you know that the symbols and written script in black panther are based on an actual script called nsibdi .
13423,"that is very interesting , i did not know that . amazing !"
13424,i am amazed that tom hanks is the highest alltime box office star . he has earned over 8 . 5 billion worldwide in film earnings . amazin g .
13425,"i am not . he has done so much over the years . almost al his movies are a it , i actually ca n't even think of one bad movie he has done lo laid you know that he does n't take any bad guy roles ?"
13426,i could see that . he is so likable ! did you ever see the movie treasure planet by disney . it was the worst ever . it was also one of the most expensive flop of all time .
13427,"wow , never saw i . ca n't believe there are disney movies that didn ' g mate money lol"
13428,i know ! f frozen was the first disney film directed by a man . i would have figured it would have happened before thaat !
13429,"that is weird . a lot of te disney movies have women leads too lol that movie as really good , frozen"
13430,i liked it too . especially surprising because walt disney pictures is regarded as one of hollywood 's big six film studios .
13431,"i believe i t , children make parents spend lots of money ! lol"
13432,"exactly , case in point , the toy industry gets involved i disney animations even before the beginning of film production . lots of money to be , and !"
13433,"yeah , seriously , before a movie comes out my kids are asking for toy characters i never even heard of !"
13434,mine too ! they sure can make a ton of different toys with all the characters hat are in these movies .
13435,"yeah , i admit i like a lot of disney stuff too , not he hoya but some collectables 3d disney is smart tat way though , a im for the kids first lol"
13436,yes . . . and the adults will follow . they once considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty failed . can you imagine if they did ?
13437,"no i ca n't imagine that one movie flop wil bring that whole company , event at the time of sleeping beauty lol its been really good chatting !"
13438,did you watch the movie black panther ?
13439,"yes it was a decent fil . i generally enjoy the quality of recent marvel superhero is and it had a high quality pasta s well . did you know black panther , the superhero , is estimated to be worth 50 billion ;"
13440,"wow , i thought tony stark was hte richest of them all , that is interesting , welsh e is like the president of wakanda ."
13441,"regardless , it is impressive enough thats superheros such as stark , wayne , and black panther i worth billions !"
13442,"yeah , i thought wayne was the richest of hem all an turns out he has an 80 billion worth , black panther was called black leopard at some point"
13443,"well if you ar ethan much , you can spend without thinking bout expenses so after a point , they are just amazingly rich period . furthermore , black panther is also unique in that it will end teh year ban saudi arabia previously enacted ."
13444,"yeah , i heard theyd ad a strict ban due to religious reasons , women could n't driver until after 2017 ."
13445,thai shane could reflect hte changing socioeconomic climate in saudi arabia as the crown prince muhammed bin salad wants to brand himself favs as social modernizers while onsolidating power .
13446,"im just glad di live in america , so many issues in other countries , one thing is certain , that disney and marvel are the big winners here ."
13447,"indeed , america movie studios like disney and marvel require foreign markets for growth and this recent change benefits them substantially , ."
13448,they sure are kicking docs behind l the international box for that movie was around 29 . 5 billion dolars
13449,"dc did well on wonder woman and the dark knight , but recent movies like batman vs superman or green lantern were n't the best ."
13450,"i loved the batman trilogy and i agree with you m dc has n't made good movies lately , i wonder how much their oz office was ."
13451,"too bad the box office does n't necessary represent how good the movie is . for instance , disney 's well known sleeping beauty was considered a box office failure ."
13452,"i didnt know that ! its one of the most popular movies now , t om hanks is the highest box office star of all time ."
13453,i recently read he aide over 8 . 5 billion in film earnings . he is a good actor .
13454,"i think he is a good actor as well , do you like walt disney pictures ?"
13455,i feel that walt disney does a good job of defining old fairy tales to be more kid friendly . they have also produced many popular films like lion king or frozen .
13456,"i agree , did yo know that frozen is the fist animated film with a way as a director ."
13457,i also only recently read about that . disney does a good job of producing high quality products and generating revenue through various different revenue stream such as with the toy industry .
13458,i now ! it seems unreal how the toy industry is behind the productions
13459,fan you a comic fan . i love antman . he is a dc superhero .
13460,"yes , i agree . so i guess you watched ' batman v superman : dawn of justice ' , right ? did you like emit ?"
13461,"not really , i was disappointed in it . did you kno wthe batman phd a advisory called condiment king . he was defeated by slipping on his own ketchup ."
13462,"no , i did n't know . i also didnt know there is a silver coin with superman on te heads side . this is legal render in canada ."
13463,"cool , i need one of those . adam west , who played batman his true satan"
13464,do i understand correctly that hot first fine superman as superhero was published in a comic boo kin 1938 ?
13465,"yes , it was . i was saying heh as a batman logo on a molar . als gotham city is supposed to be located in new jersey ."
13466,true . i did n't know that there was a version of superman create where superman wa raised in ussr . i 'm wondering what was an idea behind that .
13467,i read that comic . in the most recent dc animated tim ? ' b antman vs robin ' weird al did some voiceover work .
13468,really ? it sounds like a lot of fun .
13469,"yes , and plays great i 'm sure . changing topics , pixar studio has a secret room that celebrities visit ."
13470,"well , i did n't know , but i 'm not surprised . it 's easy to imagine ."
13471,"also , i cant believe that judge judy makes 123 , 000 per episode ."
13472,"i wo n't pay so much . i 'm opinion , it 's very very average work and nothing special there ."
13473,what ? ? ? that amount makes her the second highest paid celebrity . lebron james is first .
13474,"yes . i know about lebron james . btw , did you know that jenna marble makes over 300k annually on youtube channel l ? i 'm wondering how much people mark neon youtube in general ."
13475,i am not sure . i did know that he first celebrity to appear on sesame street was carol burnett .
13476,"yes , i remember i watcher dog with my nephew . seaman is god ."
13477,"yes . i ill leave yoy with this . going back to superman , the actor henry cavill , who currently plays superman , almost missed the call for the role because he was playing ' world of warcraft ' ."
13478,ok . thanks . have a good day !

13522,"hello , do you like snakes ? i am afraid of them , really afraid"
13523,"i actually love sharks lol , i just think they narrow bodies are pretty cool and they scare everyone"
13524,"i want to move to new zealand , i heard theres no snakes over there"
13525,it only in one zealand but ireland has no snakes too
13526,"mother great place to go then , i hear there are also flying snakes"
13527,i
13528,sould that make you afraid ?
13529,"they sound pretty scary , o 've never heard of flying snake but it 's pretty cool the can launch at prey"
13530,you know the fear of snakes is not only hardwired in our brains but also in the brain of monkeys
13531,i heard not only the fear of snakes is hard wired but of spiders too
13532,"spiders are scary too , enough about those scare creatures do you like comic books ?"
13533,"i like marvel comics , i 'm surprised they ace only th 53rd largest comic book publisher"
13534,the 3rd largest really ? i know dc is on top but what other company is there
13535,i guess the japanese manga company biz media distributes more
13536,"it does ? that is suprising havent heard of that one before , jist like the superhero blue ear"
13537,"have you heard of access , the only shared superhero between dc and marvel ?"
13538,"no , what are hers upper powers ? or her purpose ?"
13539,access only purpose is o keep the dmx and marvel universes apart
13540,"oh i see , i bet she is really powerful still , do you like marvel comics or dc comics webster ?"
13541,i prefer marvel comics adn heir earth 616 universe
13542,"i do too , besides tshirt movies are way better"
13543,are you a big fan of star wars ?
13544,i am a fan of the originals . i heard solo bar ; y made 100 mil on memorial say weekend
13545,yep bombed big time ! they said female characters were undersea .
13546,they say that bu the dont see the trend of movies with female leads taking . teh movie cost upwards of 200 million to make and i dont see it
13547,they say the new generation has moved toward movies like black panther and get out .
13548,yah they say little boy would never identify with a female superheros . maybe it is not the superhero but the poor actress or writings fault ?
13549,perhaps . ron howard directed the love but i guess great directors have flops too .
13550,"' a quiet place , ' johns krasinski 's 17 million directorial debut , has become a global juggernaut , . i think it was ok but it was not original ."
13551,"he 's going on up in th would . he was on the office , right ?"
13552,"yeah he was tim or ted or whatever it was . in 2013 , star wars was dubbed in navajo so it is nice they get to hear it in their language"
13553,true . i read somewhere that black panther was the richest superhero . .
13554,i guess but he is by far one of the worst . block panther was not named after the black panther party like most people believe
13555,whose your favorite superhero ?
13556,sadly we will never et a real superhero movie because of how they sold characters off . but the true story of thanos not teh one in the movie is one that will make you question if he is bad .
13557,'ll ave to read up on taht . my favorite was bruce wayne aka batman . the older movies of course . they say he 's the 3rd richest superhero .
13558,tony stark is worth 100 billion if i remember right .
13559,thaat 's iron man ?
13560,yeah he is iron man . and the book you want to look for is called thanos quest .
13561,list hat the name of the popular reddit account ? now this all mates a bit of sense . i
13562,im not sure abou tthat . it ws the story about him search for the stones . marvel censored m'baku 's utterance of ' praise hanuman ! ' in indian releases of black panther . i guess they di know want to offend
13563,we life in a different world now .
13564,"hey there , did you ever watch star wars ?"
13565,"hi ! yes , i 've see all the star wars movies , i wa sa contributor to the 100 million opening box office revenue on opening weekend ? do you watch star war ?"
13566,"yes me too , it i sreqallyg took . it is so popular it was even dubbed in navajo ."
13567,"i took them a long time , but i wonder why they chose to do tha he guess how much james earl jones made for his work on recording all of darth vadar 's lines for the franchise"
13568,was it a lt ? 20th century fox even thought it a going to flop altogether .
13569,"h remade 7500 , but it only took him 2 . 5 hour the do all of the recordings ! that 's job a bad payday , especially if he also gets the revenues from licensing and merchandise and dvds !"
13570,"oh nice , they that is true all the money on the side . george lucas made so much money because of it because he convinced the studio to keep the licensing nad merchandising right t himself for a small fee ."
13571,genius ! titles crazy to think that he believed in himself so much we no one else did any look at how much it paid off ! he 's a billionaire now because of his creativity ! but his wife was also a reason for the major changes in the original star wars film and she even won an academy award for editing hte film !
13572,you never know right ? they made guy a good team in tha snes . isaac apparently asked that ncis character be a native of planet yavin 4 because it was filmed in guatemala and he is from there .
13573,"they really do , if the divorce , it sur world be a costly one . oh i did n't know hat about isaac . i actually really ike marvel films too , especially the black panther film , my children imitate she x ' wakanda ' sign at home all the time ."
13574,"that more has been such a huge one , really . it is the richest superhero too ."
13575,oh really ? i wouldve thought that ton stark from iron an was the richest character .
13576,he much but rich but not that rich . did you know that scripts and symbols in the movie date back t 4th centry ?
13577,"wow , i did n't know tat . i wonder how they came up with all those interesting names of the characters . marble had to censor m'baku 's chant in india because they feared that a character or villain praising a hind god would lead to backlash"
13578,"how about disney , do you know the real name of minnie mouse ?"
13579,"no , what is the new lame of minnie mouse ? i love disney , especially pixar movies . do you ?"
13580,her name is minerva mouse . i wonder who came up with that name . yeah me too .
13581,"that 's an odd name , i wonder if any parents named their children after the characters . i had no idea that disney hides mickey houses in their disney thing san theres . a whole subculture medicare to that . in of like the stan lee signature at disney these parks ."
13582,yeah hat is really strange . did you watch walle ?
13583,"i did see that movie and disney really hs established itself as the leader in the animation industry and its also present in their film production , television , and the parks !"
13584,very true . it sas names as such as a tp to the hat to walter elias disney .
13585,"oh ok , i did n't know that atandt owned walt disney studios because they own nbc and warner media . is that true ?"
13586,"i did not know that either , neat is pretty cool ; it was nice chatting with lou ."
13587,hello .
13588,halo .
13589,"so , did you see solo ?"
13590,yes . i believe theur was much missed opportunity in the film .
13591,some here . i did n't like how they changed the character of han solo . it didnt line up with how he was in the original trilogy .
13592,agreed . the actor lacked too day of the inherent qualities harrison ford brought to the royal .
13593,"i thought so , too . i knew it would b different because it was n't harrison ford . nothing against the actor in solo . i though party of the story ; knew here ok , buy it seemed really formulaic at times ."
13594,the studio really needed to reevaluate and reinvent more for this film .
13595,"i agree . it seems they just though t ' well , its cars wars , just throw in whatever has worked in the past and people will pay tos i it . '"
13596,"yes . it seems like the most sucessful movies now are the innovative , new ones ."
13597,exactly . did you see ' a quiet place ' ? i really liked that one .
13598,"ia m goint o see it this week , actually . linking forward to contrasting it with other suspend films ."
13599,"i think you 'll like it . it 's very different than most other films . i wo n't spoil the story for you , but , best of the dialogue in the film is done with american sin language , with screen nations , ."
13600,great . i do think that audiences really appreciate unique films presented by innovators more than ' wicket ' based blockbusters .
13601,"i think they do . r remember the first ' paranormal activity ' film . say what you will about the mediocre sequels , but the firs was very inventive . even if ' found footage ' films had been done before l"
13602,"yes , i think there is plenty of room in the marketplace for more originals and less sequels ."
13603,"true . however , with disney about to own fox , i 'm skeptical that will happen ."
13604,that i true . although they do manage to produce a lot of innovative ideas . they must overcycld them too one .
13605,i did n't see black panther . sas it any good ?
13606,"j have yet to see it m , but ther reviews seem promising . i have it on my list . the sociopolitical ofertones seem to be played up by many reviews ."
13607,"well , i have to ge going . but , it 's been nice talking to you ."
13608,it has been very nice . enjoy your day .
13609,goodbye
13610,"hi , how are you ?"
13611,"good . did you see the new star wars sequel , solo ? i heard it tanked at the box office ."
13612,"i watched a little of it on netflix but not the whole thing yet . i usually save movie for thee gym when i am on the ytreadmi , l . have yu seen it ?"
13613,"no no i have i on my list of movies to watch , right after the other stars wars movie released just before solo , the last jedi ."
13614,i saw that they just released that on netflix . j may not finish solo and just go to the last jedi . i think that got better reviews . . .
13615,"with a measly 100 mil on opening weekend , solo cell under harsh criticism . i think it was destined tos after so , e because harrison ford , the original hans solo , was so beloved ."
13616,100m is struggling to squeak by ? imagine if it was good ? i think disney did too many too quick and saturated the market when it wasnt ' ended .
13617,"agreed . give me 100 million for one weekend , and i would be happy with a flop too . of course , solo came out so close to avengers : infinity wars and deadpool that it may still do well over the top haul ."
13618,yeah . i wonder what it cost to make that movie ? do you think it was worth the time and resources ?
13619,i heard it cost about 200 million to make and another140 mil to promote . they could have done better if they just bought everyone free tickets .
13620,i just read that star wars was the first major fired to be dubbed in a native american language . that 's cool .
13621,"nice . i remember when the original star wars came out , everyones in mt class talking about it and seeing it liked times before it lets own , ad now the average classroom of students barely notice this prequel was even out ."
13622,"yeah . i do feel like episode 1 , the 4th one , as really anticipated . i also know that jar jar bind killed the movie . . ."
13623,"the binxinator , killing sequels . . . . ponder if george lucas , the original director , ha anything todo o with that ."
13624,"i hope no , i think he has more sense than that but who know . he made a lot of money selling to disney tough . . ."
13625,like he needed more money . did you now that he originally negotiated to forgo his directing fee in order to retain merchandising and end licensing rights . 20th century fox choked big on that move .
13626,i did n't know that . did you know minnie mouse is short for minerva mouse ?
13627,"met herad t a party once . i chad a serious addiction to helium as i recall . got it from mickey . another actor with a funny voice , r2d2 ll lucas said r2d2 was the on who firsts old the stage story some hundred years after it 's occurrence ."
13628,ha ! nice . did you know walle was named after after elias disney ? i had no idea !

13632,i 'm reading it mow . is n't that terrible ?
13633,i 'm quit shocked and a bit disgusted ! i would think that malaysia is a conservative country ! what do you think would alpine if tha were to be published in the us ?
13634,terrible stings i 'm sure . thank god we are no longer that backwards .
13635,"yeah , i think there might slow be a lot of lawsuits and a social media outcry of that . it also reminds me of the actor who staged his own hate crime for fame , quite surprised , did you hear about that ?"
13636,i did . it 's unfortunate that he used being gay against himself . in malaysia an 18 year old who beaten and burned because he was gay .
13637,"it 's terrible for that actor to take advantage of people 's empathy and the forwards environment we live in today ! on a lighter subject , i enjoy disney films , i think frozen is my favorite and it was the first film directed by a woman . have you seen it ?"
13638,i 've seen parts of it . i heard the disney movie beauty and the beast was banned in malaysia because of a gay scene . what scene could possibly be considered gay ?
13639,"wow and yet they allow the publication of a ' how t ' article ? i ' ? m not sure which scene would be considered gay and offensive . i did n't know jackie chan sang in that film , does that mean e was the beast ?"
13640,i do n't know ! i did n't even know jackie chan could sing !
13641,"george r . r . martin wrote fourteen episodes of the beauty and the beast series in the late 80s . i did n't even know there was a tv series , have you seen it ?"
13642,no ! i had no idea ! did you now that a mogul of bullet proof clothing shoots all his employee stop test the garments ? i would not want to work there !
13643,"what ? ! that 's crazy ! it in that definitely falls under workplace harassment ! i wonder if teh roles are vice versa , can the development team also test tit on others ?"
13644,no idea ! that is so crazy ! did you also know that greeks made chair clothes out of asbestos ? oh my gosh !
13645,"i do n't think i see any benefit for making clothes out of asbestos , speaking of asbestos , i just paid a lot of money to get rid of asbestos in my old house ! oh boy ma i glad we are much more forwards they other places !"
13646,me too . i used to do hvae and would not accept z job if there was asbestos to be removed . i just was n't equipped . a man once wore 70 items of clothe stop not pay a baggage charge at an airport .
13647,"oh you goodness ! that 's really commendable for you to turn down jobs like that because health is more important ! but i do worry that when they removed it , it seemed into the carpet since i had a local guy do it for a lot less . lo ; , that 's hi ; various , i 've tried layering up for the winter and ca n't move my limbs with just five layers !"
13648,"i know ! and most of your clothes actually fit , so it waist like etc would pick bigger items to ear ! did you know people used to use old faithful to wash their clothes ? and vacuum alot . it will help get it out of the markets ."
13649,"yeah exactly ! i think i would ge ta very great laugh if i saw that at the airport , wonder if there 's any laws or fines that detail that . i 'd have to try that an steam clean the carpet too ! there 's a store in alabama that sells titles found in unclaimed baggage at airports ! why would anyone not claim their baggage ? !"
13650,maybe distance would keep them from claiming it ? it would be fun to shop there though ! have you ever been ?
13651,"i 'd imagine people carry important thing for souvenirs and airlines would send the luggage to them if they lost it . i have never stopped there , but would be interested in seeing what 's there , maybe i can find cheaper electronics at a discount , i wonder how much they lol it for realize to market price ."
13652,hi ! did you see teh newt earth and the beast !

13665,"oh , i didn ' know . i know back in the 70 's war disney used to recycle a lot of their animation frames which resulted in identical scenes in some movies ."

13719,i agree lol . th suns diameter is 109 times the size of earth !
13720,"the sun is big then . with a mass of 330 , 000 mimes th heart h , i bet the sun weighs a good percentage of the far system ."
13721,it accounts for 99 . 86 if the total mass sofa the solar system ! lolol
13722,"if anyone would write a book about the sun , it would not be , athryn harrison . her stories are apt bout the crazy family she grew uo in . not science at all ."

13726,"yes , white . wes is the sun as yellow or red because of hte atmosphere of earth ."
13727,"interesting , a lightening bolt is hotter than hue surface o he sun . 5 times hotter !"
13728,i wonder who they got to hold the thermometer . i am willing to bet th surface of the sun is one temperature and its a bit warmer a few thousand km inside .
13729,"hahaha it also produces enough energy in 1 second to meet the new of the entire planet for 500 , 000 years . no idea how hey could possibly know that ."

13732,an i throught the suns ad a weight problem accounting 99 . 86 percent of the solar system . i guess there is more out there than just us .
13733,do you have a choice between fiction or nonfiction ? i tend to lean towards being interested in things that are nonfiction .
13734,"yes , nonfiction for me . think about neptune , it is so far away it took 165 years to travel and the sun one . thats good non fiction there ."
13735,i wonder what th atmosphere would be like because of that ? the biggest selling nonfiction book of all time is the bible !
13736,cold . i bet neptune is cold . winter is coming after all . the 165 years for a seasonal cycle . george rr martin needs to get to the point .
13737,lol get he does ! it was fun chatting with you ! have a good rest of the day !

13781,absolutely amazing . the earth is so small in comparison .
13782,"ya , did you know that caesar wrote fan fiction of oedipus nd hercules , the funny to me"

13796,"be they would vote on some of teh items on the ballot ut not others , or tell their friends tebow here voting for one candidate but actually vote for none ."
13797,"lol ; m shady bastard : , i actually do n't care what my fr8neds think of me , i always say who i 'm voting for ; ,"
13798,that 's very honest of you . did you know that voter turnout for presidential elections has n't been above 62 . 8 percent in the past 00 years ?
13799,"i guess people dont live they can make a change . . . and probably for the past 100 years ho borg change nwas made : ,"
13800,"that and its are for some people to vote because of transportation , work schedules , child care and other responsibilities ."
13801,that 's right . . . . hey why ca n't they make it online ? i 'm sure frequency would improved . . .
13802,"yes , but it woul be hardest o avoid voter fraud ."
13803,"i do n't know . . . i mean those voted are going into the computer anyway . . . but first people are counting it . . . so there are two margins or error or fraud ; l ,"
13804,"did you know that in 2012 , international election observers were blocked from the polls in nine states ?"
13805,blocked ? do you know why ?
13806,no . i 'm not lure . died you know taht 34 percent of black ken in alabama have permanently lost the right to vote ?
13807,"what , l ike in today 's times ? what did they do to deserve that ?"
13808,"probably felony convictions , whuch is unsettling when you think about how some groups of people are more often charge with crimes whereas others get away with the same things ."
13809,"you 're probably right , ut i would need to see the same numbers for white people as wel : ,"
13810,"yes , it would be interesting to see the full stat on that ."
13811,"did you know that astronauts can vote from space ? : ,"
13812,yes ! i wonder if they do so by absentee ballot or by some other means .
13813,"they put it in a envelope zeland drop it on earth ; , lol"
13814,that sounds like fun . it 's been good talking . have a great day !
13815,"did you know hat citizens of austin , texas voted to rename their garbage dump after fred durst ? that 's funny to me !"
13816,tha ties quite an interesting fact you have there . is there a reason why they are naming it after fred durst ?
13817,"i dunno , i guess the population is n't much of limp bizkit fans ."
13818,did you know that hillary clinton hates limp bizkit as well ?
13819,she probably beat them when she won the grammy for fdr audiobook ' it takes a village . '
13820,"the book . quite interesting , given that she rejected bill ? s marriage proposal for two years before finally agreeing to marry him ."
13821,i 'm surprised he didnt ' give up . he had high aspirations dating the president of young republicans when the as in college .
13822,yah . this use to be a republican . quite the turn of events there to bar the democratic party 's nominee for the 2016 election .
13823,yeah it is . she wa sa role model for many women . father 's were able to show their daughters that they could be anything they wanted to be .
13824,"i totally agreethat if the father 's firt child is a daughter , it can was the father 's vote towards female . we 're in the day and age of roped models ."
13825,i agree we are . everyone needs someone to look up to .
13826,"it 's ot just limited to politics , it applies to other fields such as since , technology , engineering and mathematics . fields which are currently dominated by males ."
13827,it 's good o see diversity in different fields . i definitely see it as a good thin g .
13828,"yes it is . however , you have the other side of the of with all these metoo movements . . ."
13829,"yeah that has taken a toll , especially on hollywood . for of it . justified though ."
13830,what do you mean justified ?
13831,mon deserve to be all out for their injustices against women .
13832,at the moment or instant it happens or can it be up to the lifespan of teh person ? what 's the limitation ?
13833,"i feel that some woman are embarrassed by hte situation . ot takes a lot of courage to come out , but i think allegations shoud be made sooner rather than later . that adds more to the justification ."
13834,"fear sounds like an excuse , bu todo understand what point . if you do n't have any support , its ' going to be difficult to come out , same with being part of lgbtq ."
13835,support is key . it was nice hating with you !
13836,"hi there , do you thin elections are important ?"
13837,i think elections are very important . they have represented democracy since the 17th century .
13838,officials in athens thought that elections would lead o oligarchies so they used rotaries instead .
13839,that is very interesting ? . the study of results and othe statistics related to elections is called psephology .
13840,"interesting ! so since 1900 , the taller candidate hs won the us presidential election . i hope that 's just a coincidence !"
13841,yes that is an itneresfing stat . trump was taller than hillary i believe . 75 percent is a big majority .
13842,do yu thin having a none of these candidates voting option is useful ?
13843,i think it would be nice to have . i 'm kind of surprised nevada is the only state to have it .
13844,"yeah me too . do astronauts vote from space , bu for those of us on earth it seem hte voter trout is low . the turnout for presidential selections has n't reached 62 . 8 percent in the last 100 years ."
13845,i wish it wash higher . during the 2012 us elections iternationaoe electoral observers the blocked from the polls and nine states . is that even legal ?
13846,"hmm , how weird . in india they made the effort otto include people who could n't easily vote . there wa sa polling booth in a forest full lof lions for ons single voter ."
13847,that sound dangerous but very good for democracy . surprisingly not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918 .
13848,in alabama 34 percent of he black male population has lost their vote
13849,that is terrible . even citizens in austin texas voted to rename the garbage dump fred durst .
13850,yeah we use voting for some interesting things !
13851,definitely . it was a big surprise clinton did n't get elected . she was president of the young republicans in college even thoug she identifies as a democrat now .
13852,"wow , interesting ! another interesting thing about hillary is she adopts a southern draw when campaigning in southern states ."
13853,very smart of her . stephen hawking once lectured at the white house on science with both hillary and her husband .
13854,i wonder what the lecture was about . i 'll have to look tht up .
13855,yeah it would be fascinating to hear you ' r such a smart guy . clinton is actually grammy winner too . very talented . thanks again for talking fo me today hope you have a good one .
13856,greats chatting with you . have a good one !
13857,"hi , how are you ? what do yo know of our friend the sun ?"
13858,"hi , i know the sun makes up 99 . 86 percent of the mass of our entire far system . but , i 'd sure like to see him sometime today , it 's been raining here at my house , as morning !"
13859,"he can be a shy one at times . give him some time . he 'll come back , as rampant as ever ."
13860,"yeah , i some to see taht nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma . how about you ?"
13861,i do like the sun . he has generally been consistent . he shows up regularly but does n't really get in the way too much . does his job .
13862,did you know the sun 's equator rotates faster than its poles ?
13863,i guess it 's hot solid so the wildest part moves ; pretyy fast . that makes sense .
13864,interesting fact : helium was discovered on the sun before it was found on earth !
13865,huh . i did not knoe had . i guess it 's a tough element to detect . maybe the sun is a fiery ball of mischief with all kinds of secrets .
13866,apparently so ! have you heard about hte radio station where you can listen to the suns ' musi c ?
13867,"i guess the sun like to sing , like many of us l i wonder if the sun can carry a tune . probably not ."
13868,"well , it might sound pretty wild when the solar flares ar active !"
13869,"yes , the flares really can rock hard , hard enough for hte kids !"
13870,true that ! thye sun is by far the most important source of energy for us earthlings or so i ' v read .
13871,"te sun has been quite generous with his resources . in fact , the un produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500 000 years ."
13872,that 's awesome ! i could n't imagine life on earth without its warming rays .
13873,"well , most of us could n't . we have come dependent , alist addicted . i hope that one day we will get credit to the great one in the soy ."
13874,"amen tot hat ! on a side note , 've earth that the sunset son mars are blue ."
13875,"i ill never see a sunset on mars . do n't have the money for it . anyway , great chat !"
13876,"great chatting , with you as sell . enjoy hte rest of you read , i 'm going to continue to watch it rain and hope the sun will show its face for a little while . lol"
13877,i 'm sure that he has fond feelings for you too . have a good day !
13878,"trade care , friend !"
13879,did you ever read ' the kiss ' hey kiathyn harrison ? it is abou tan affair she had with her lohgestranged father while in her 20s '
13880,omg no ! harrison is very controversial !
13881,"yes , it is very shocking . she had written about her childhood with her grandparents , but later this ."
13882,"from this it sounds like the person likes the book . a touching and at times jawdropping portrait of the material grandparents who raised her , i hat she 's only getting to this rich material now ."
13883,hey grandmother apparently is a fabulous character .
13884,"wow , i guess so . her first novel was called thicker ten water ."
13885,her grandfather apparently was raised by a widow mother and she had to take in borders . her grandfather as a survey and engineer in alaska and then fought knw wwi ending up a traveling spokesman in california . her grandmother
13886,"i was just reading that ! our financial collapse i schizophrenic . we are desperately poor , and i lack fo nothing , ' how is that possible ?"
13887,"they had all kinds of films and lessons along with fancy things , but still saved up for a toaster with bue chip trading stamps . i guess hey balanced things ou still making her appreciate what she got an work for it ."
13888,"i guess so . the vocabulary was british sweaters were jumps , washcloths were flannel s ."
13889,interesting ! she has o go to bed a theyve n ! j wonder if she had any siblings ?
13890,that is a good question ! did you know this ? the sun is the star of the center of the solar system .
13891,"that 's cool ! it can produce every energy in one second to meet the need of the planet . 500 , 000 years ! ouch !"
13892,we need to harness that ! i 'll have to look this up ! there is a radio station that translates solar activity into sound and you can listen live ol the sun 's music
13893,i wonder if the music is as good as elvis ! did you kno that the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in ours galaxy if i wonder how much power that star has !
13894,and the sun makes up 99 . ? 86 percent of them ass of our solar system !
13895,looks lie icy rule s ! do you like to read ? george w . bush seems to as he read 14 biographies of lincoln during his presidency and 186 historical nonfiction book . i wonder how he found time .
13896,"wow , i ? m actually impressed ! this is bad though . , the world 's longest piece of fiction is a 4 million word super smash bro brail fan fiction ."
13897,"the nest selling ' nonfiction ' book according to guinness is the bible . so many people have bought if , wonder how many have read it ?"
13898,"mu husband and i were talking about that last name . scary , huh ? term ' robotics ' was accidentally coined by science fiction author isaac asimov in 1941 ."
13899,"wow , interesting . books often inspire th future or cartoon . for instance , i remember watching the jetsons with ' face time ' with george 's boss ! haha ! do you , like fiction ? julius caesar wrote fan fiction of hercules and oedipus in hi south . nice chatting !"
13900,how are you ? do you like stars wars . the franchise began in 1977
13901,"hello , how are you ? i love stars wars , although theres quite a bit of facts i did n't know that i just read recent , y ! hailed filming ' star wars : the force awakens ' , actor oscar isaac specifically requested that his character poe dameron be a native of the planet yavin 4 . this is because the scenes on yavin 4 in the original trilogy were filmed in guatemala , where isaac i actually from ."
13902,"wow , i did n't know that star wars was filmed in guatemala"
13903,"me either , that must have been hot ! ! lol marcia lucas , george lucas 's then wife , who the reason inform major changes to the original star wars film . obi wan 's death , leia 's good luck kiss an reuniting the trench run to increase tension were al older ideas . she won the academy award for editing the film while george did not for directing ."
13904,she did a great job ; without her the frnachise4 would never of made 8 . 5 billion dollars .
13905,"k for i know right ! huge success ! james earl jones spent only 2 . 5 hours recording all of darth vadar 's lines for star wars nad was paid 7 , 500 . i would n't mind earning hours ! thats amazing !"
13906,"i 'm sure that 7 , 500 has al ot more zeros now after how popular the franchise has become"
13907,"yeah , plus hes getting royalties ."
13908,george lucas made out good being able took veep age licensing rights for himself
13909,"he knows what they nwas worth ! e specially , since the books did so well ."
13910,"not only that but he got to keep th merchandising rights for himself , maxim grim billions"
13911,"wow ! in 2013 , s the wars was dubbed in navajo , making it the firt major film to be dubbed in a native american language"
13912,"that 's incredible , i guess a movie that makes 65 billion world be the perfect candidate for that"
13913,"do you know much about comic ? i learned some cool stuff . in 1998 , marvel offered the cinematic rights of almost all of its characters to sony for a mere 25 million . sony rejected the offer , and now purchased the rights to spiderman for 10 million believing that movie audiences would only care about him ."
13914,sony screwed up on only taking spiderman lol
13915,"i know , the pissed out big time ! marvel successfully argued in court that mutants re not people in thus of to pay the lower rate on xmen ' of ' instead of the higher ate fo rolls because the are not human ."
13916,"lol , did you know disney does nor own the rights to have marvel characters in their theme parks east of the mississippi ?"
13917,oh wow ! i wonder why that is the border lol
13918,i thin east of th mississippi the rights belong to universal studios
13919,but universal doesnt have a marvel characters or rides .
13920,"it in they used to have a spiderman ride . well i gtg , nice talkin with you"
13921,hello ! are you a star wars fan ?
13922,no . my son is af an . i 'm interested i discussing and knowing more about it though .
13923,i have not seen best of the movies but i have seen various parts . did you know that the last jedi grossed 650 . 2 million dollars ? !
13924,"i heard about it . i think the farce awakens grossed better , adjusting for inflation ."
13925,another fun fact is that james earl jones spent over 2 . 5 hours recording all of darth vader made 7500
13926,at was amazing . i george lucas still making movies . he created the star wars .
13927,i d not believe he is .
13928,"h remade over 8 . 5 , before adjusting for inflation , for his star war movies . i wonder why he stops making more movies since he is young enough h , i think ."
13929,i ca n't imagine having all of that money . are you interested in disney movies
13930,"i do . i watch disney movies with my granddaughters . the walt disney company , the power of disney movies , is very successful ."
13931,my family loves disney too ! did you know hat th lion king was the first disney film to be dubbed into zulu for its african release
13932,"i did no know thati . thanks . apparently , disney used a special camera to make their older films , like bambi , to look more realistic ."
13933,thats crazy technology for back i nthe day .
13934,"i know , right . disney is always trying to get ; p up with technology . that 's why it is very successful ."
13935,i think its very interesting that the toy industry gets involved the beginning of the film production .
13936,please tell me more about it . i am only aware ta they were involved after movies were produced successfully .
13937,it is before the production actually . i am sure they want to be able to have products launched as the movies are being showed for the first time .
13938,"it makes sense . apparently , i would take over 9 . 4 million party balloons to lift carl 's house in disney pixar movie entitled ' up ' . i like star movies ."
13939,pixar has great movies . hey are known in the big six film studios
13940,"dyes disney own pixar now ? i heard about disney warning to buy pixar but i 'm not sure . also , is the public allowed to tour disney studios in burbank , california ?"
13941,i know they won together but i am not sure if they own it .
13942,i see . do you know hat michael jackson tried to . marvel comics so that he could play spider man in his own produced movie ?
13943,i would have loved to see that . thriller probably would be featured .
13944,"i love thriller . michael jackson was not successful in his bidding but walt disney ended up acquiring marvel entertainment da anyway , i 've got o run . nice chatting with you ."
13945,hello do you like star wars ?
13946,i sure do . do you know who oscar isaac played in it ?
13947,yea hehe played poe dameron and requested that eh be from yavin 4
13948,yeah because stat was filmed in guatemala which is where he is from
13949,"yeah that was cool of him to request that , going all the way back to his roots"
13950,yup agree there with you . did you know geroge 's wife won an academy award because she vhagned things in the script ?
13951,yeah and she deserved t because she put scenes like obi wan 's death and such in there
13952,"yeah exactly , or leia 's good luck kiss . those made hte movie what it is"
13953,turned . it was also th first major film to be dubbed in navajo
13954,that is awesome . 20th century originally thought ut was goint to flop . man they were wrong
13955,yup and he was smart to buy the rights o it for 500 000 and make billion shatter
13956,"exactly , smart business man and a great movie maker"
13957,yup . do you ike marvel ?
13958,i have marvel . did you now they offered the rights to the character to sony and they only bought spiderman ?
13959,"they had a great chance here but thought only spiderman was going to b popular , their loss"
13960,yeah exactly . do you know the character access ?
13961,"yes he guy that keeps dc and marvel separate , pretty cool"
13962,"yeah it is . how about blue ear , the superhero ?"
13963,yes that in was created for a deaf little kid who complained o his mom that there are not superheroes with hearing aids
13964,yeah hat was super sweet of them to accommodate a little kid and make him feel powerful
13965,"i know , htey do stuff like that from time to time"
13966,hello ! do you like disney ?
13967,"hello , yes i do like disney . i heard recently that the movie , wreck it ralph , had been in development since the late 1980s !"
13968,that is crazy . i a surprised that it has taken that long . it was a really good movie .
13969,"i agree ! maybe they is why i wa so good though , because they took so much time with it . they changed the rule alone you times ."
13970,it is a unique title . my favorite is lion kin thought . it was the first disney film to be dubbed into zulu for its african release .
13971,"i love lion king , the movie and the soundtrack ! hey , did you know that back in the 70s disney reused a lot of their animation frames which resulted in identical scenes in some movies ?"
13972,"i would like to see tht . another new one that i love is frozen , which was the first animated disney film directed by a woman ."
13973,frozen was very good i have to admit it i thought i might be getting too old for disney n't i did like it !
13974,i have never thought about the toy industry in regards to movies .
13975,i do sometimes . there a lot of different toy related movies . it seems like teh toy industry gets involved before the movie is released .
13976,it makes sense that they will have inventory before the movie shows . it would be bad for sakes to wait until after the movie is released to start making toys .
13977,i agree . toy spare very important . marvel went to cout about their xmen toys .
13978,i heard but that . they argued that mutants are not people !
13979,"i do n't see how they won in my opinion , they are people lol ! but 's , it 's cool ! disney even owns a bit of marvel ow speaking of disney ."
13980,and teh still ca n't show their characters at the theme park
13981,it 's sad to have to andre to contracts signed before you buy something . marvel signed a contract wit universal and that effects disney .
13982,it would have be cool to see the characters walking around hte parks for entertainment and pictures .
13983,true . maybe someday they 'll be able t get out of the contract .
13984,i am sure with enough money they will be able too .
13985,disney does have the money . they are regarded as one of the big six film studios in hollywood .
13986,i like that they still give back and try to keep kid s !
13987,"hi , are you ready to chat ?"
13988,i am . it was illegal to women to wear pants in france until 2013 .
13989,was it ? i think women wore pants . what happened ? did someone get arrested ? what about all the american tourists ? did they pay fines ?
13990,sounds weird to me but i read it . also women were not allowed fo wear pants on the senate floor until 1993 .
13991,"that males sense . why would we want women wearing pants on the senate floor ? sets a dangerous precedent . own women would be wearing pants everywhere , and that would be chaos !"
13992,"speaking of pants apparently one of the hulk 's superpowers is indestructible pants , haha !"
13993,th ban had to buy special pants . they do n't sel them on amazon . he is a modest monster .
13994,imagine having a job where you have to test bulletproof cloths by getting shot in them .
13995,"that sounds like a great job ! how much does it pay ? when life gives you bullets , get a job testing clothing !"
13996,apparently the greeks made asbestos clothing and it was treated like it was as valuable as gold .
13997,"teh greeks ? boy , they must have had less of cancer and breathing problems . what would you do with clothing like that ? i guess you can impress your friends ."
13998,"well when you compare it to the guy who wore 70 items of clothing in a chinese airport to avoid bagging charges , not sure who wins ."
13999,i would wear a hundred items if need be ! i do n't care if people stare ! i do n't care if security makes me take them off !
14000,i ear you . apparently the color of baseball empires is of vital importance to hte league .
14001,the color of basetball umpires ? their loathing ? i always thought it was pink because taht 's the most festival color .

14021,"hahaha that awesome . , in my best old lady voice . . . . , do you like to wear trousers ? lol i do . i do n't go anywhere without hem ."
14022,"trousers are the best , i dont ' know why the romans would consider them barbarian ."
14023,"i never knew that . i guess thats why the are always shown wearing togas , etc . lol"
14024,"maybe because ebabrarian were wearing trousers art that time , not because they were snobbish of pants ."
14025,lol i find it funny that aladdin 's pants were modeled after mc hammer . that is spot on hilarious !
14026,"do if aladdin was filmed in the 70s , he would wear disco pants and shirts with large collar ? i would want to see that ."
14027,"hahaha nice . in collinsville , il they have a law tha prohibits saggy pants . lo ; l"
14028,"maybe that is for safety reasons , if it is a rural town , saggy pants could be dangerous around machinery . ."
14029,that woulda fake sense then . beaver though do that . we have an amish community near me so i could see somehting bad happening . there 's a lot of the amish who have had bad accidents in some of the lumber wills theyd ave where they got caught rib the machinery .
14030,"yeah , safety is important , that why you do n't see people in robe or toga in refinwery . even i they were fireproof ."

14036,"i 've never seen the film , but maybe i should . i did read the snow queen by adverse many years ago ."
14037,"cool , i guess jennifer lee is the first female director of a walt disney animation , thats ' surprising considering it 's almost a 100 years old"
14038,women generally don ' 6 get into positions of power in hollywood . new made a film that generated over 1 billion .
14039,"it 's funny , disney originally named frozen ' snow queen ' but changed it because they thought feminine titles underperformed . the box office"
14040,"that 's a good point sr robert lopez wrote let it go for frozen , and has won an emmy , grammy , oscar , and tony ."
14041,"that 's interesting , he also guest wrote a south park episode k surprising he worked on an adult show , ike that"
14042,"he is a talented composer ! mc hammer 's pants also have a disney , it seems ."
14043,"lol , i did think aladdin 's pants looked familiar when i saw it at the theater as a kid"
14044,"according to the romans , pants were barbaric . i wonder how the romans rode horses ."
14045,not comfortably i 'd imagine if they did n't wear pants because they though it too barbaric
14046,"i wonde their take in saggy pants would be . probably would ave outlawed , like in collinsville ."
14047,"maybe , i wonde what he would think of pilgrim clothing which wa apparently full of color"
14048,the oigeims were america 's first hippie ! long hair and interesting clothes . they would never have sued a dry center for 67 million though .
14049,"suing a dry cleaner for 67 million for the loss of pants is ridiculous , i 'm not surprised a d . c . judge did that"
14050,the judge seems like a bully . i woul expect a judge to be more ervenhanded with the way .
14051,"yea , maybe he should try to do something about rip curl making clothes in north korea but putting made in china on the label"
14052,i disagree with that . i do n't think we should n't be doing any business with north korea .
14053,yea bad not as sneaky as selling unclaimed clothes from unclaimed baggage from airports like a store in alabama does
14054,tha must be a great way to make money ! i wonder if they have to pay for the stuff before they sell it .

14261,"ya i 'm glad he can relax , w would you say you 're more of a marvel or dc person ?"
14262,"i am more of a marvel person , what is your favorite super hero movie of any since though ?"
14263,"oh i like iron man and wolverine myself , but my favorite superhero of ll time would be batman who is dc , yours ?"
14264,my favorite movie from teh super heroes would probably be the fist batman with michael keaton .
14265,haha i do like him as batman ! in of nice is marvel comics created a superhero specifically for a 4 year old boy
14266,yeah i think that is super cool actually . i guess the are something like 300 of them total .
14267,"oh wow that is impressive , i remember when disney acquired marvel in 2009 , i though that was a crazy thing , and tey have exploded"
14268,"yeah that definitely has paid off , should be a good investment for years to come ."
14269,"i definitely , did you hear one here is only one character owned by both marvel and dc ?"
14270,"yeah and sounds like the name fits the character as well . i was nice talking with you today , i hope you have a good one ."
14271,"they here , do you like superhero movies ?"
14272,not really much of a fan of those types of movies . what about you ?
14273,"i like them actually , kind of fun to watch . i recently watched avengers : infinity war ."
14274,"have n't seen it . i guess it 's good form marvel fans , but i wonder how many of these films disney will release in the next few years ."
14275,it will be interesting to see tha to sure . it is the first film that was the with digital imax cameras only .
14276,"i think there must beam ore money in th cinema experience . i figure tha tat home , there is no imax , so to draw people to the theater , they need imax ."
14277,yeah true . do you know who voice 'the hulk ?
14278,don ' know . tune hulk is th big green fellow ?
14279,yes that is him . in was played by lou ferrigno once and now he stills does th voice for the character .
14280,"that 's great ! good for lou ! the man is deaf in one year . are you keen on learning about the universe that we live in , not the marvel universe ?"
14281,"yes , very much do . did you know there are stars in the universe that we can touch , they are cold enough ,"
14282,i guess that would be an interesting experience . i wonder whether we could live on those stars .
14283,interesting way of thinking . some believe the universe is a giant superhologram .
14284,i wonder wht i should do with that information . should i just treat everyone like a miracle ? interesting idea .
14285,that is interesting indeed . other think taht universes evolve like s ; species do through evolution .
14286,"so the stronger universes survive , an age to propagate their laws , while the weaker ones die ? i wonder which kind of universe we are in ."
14287,yeah that is an interesting theory . another one is that th the is only one electron in the universe .
14288,only one ? how would we all share that electron ? seems like an impossib8lity .
14289,i know right ? another says that a region is still pulling galaxies into others
14290,"i figure i 'm pretty good for thet i being . may , it 's been great chatting !"
14291,"same here , have a good one"
14292,do you like marvel comics ?
14293,i love it . do you know who owns the rights to spiderman ?
14294,"yes it is sony , they bought hem back in 1998"
14295,yeah and they could have bought the rest of them as well but did not
14296,"yeah for only 5 , hat was not a smart decision then"
14297,yeah . have you heard of the character access ?
14298,yes that is the one that keeps the marvel and dc universes separate
14299,yea . did you know marvel had to argue in court that mutants are not people ?
14300,yes that was so they can keep the price of the xmen toys down
14301,yeah . did yo know disney does noth ave the rights to characters east of mississippi
14302,yes tthat was due to a contract with universal studios in the 90s
14303,yeah . did you hear of he blueray superhero
14304,yes they made it for that guy with a hearing aid . do you like the avengers movies ?
14305,yes i do . the infinity war one was made with imax digital cameras
14306,yeah . who you know who is he waitress that captain america save s ?
14307,ye star is the one that voices gretchen in recess
14308,yeah . did you know lou ferrigno voices the hulk ?

14310,yeah pretty cool . it was really nice chatting with you
14311,"same here , a n deep an eye on news superhero movies that might come out"
14312,"haha yeah , have a great one"
14313,are you af an of the avengers movies ?
14314,i have only seen one of two i far . i have not seen infinity wa rye . are you a few of the movies ?
14315,"i have not seen any of the movies i have to admit , but now theyd o very well at the box office ."
14316,i have heard that too . i was surprise it learn that some of the die in the infinity war movie though . i wonder how the studio will keep going with movies after this .
14317,"yeah i agree , i think they will come up with new characters to keep it going in ny opinion ."
14318,"probably so . have you heard of that character , access ? it 's sole purpose seems to be to keep marvel and dc separate ."
14319,i haven ot heard of him no da re you a fan of marvel comics in general ?
14320,i guess so . i do like some of the movies . i actually have n't read very many comics . disney bought marvel in 2009 so that 's probalby what is increasing it 's popularity .
14321,"yeah i think that was a huge move , very smart too ."
14322,"i agree . even though marvel has been around since 1939 , disney hae a much larger audience and ana base ."
14323,"yes the do , and it 's always growing , and buying star wars brings al those people in too ."
14324,it definitely does . did you know though that disney does not own the rights to show some marvel characters east of the mississippi in their theme parks ?
14325,"no i did n't know that , very interesting ."
14326,"yeah , it 's all due to a contract marvel signed with universal studies back in the 1990 's ."
14327,did you know marvel made a superhero named blue ear ?
14328,"no , hat 's that abou t ?"
14329,"i guess it was for a four year old who as uncomfortable wearing hearing aids and eh said superheroes dont wear them , so they made one whoo id !"
14330,what is vey nice and very impressive ! it shows that marvel is a good fit with disney because they obviously care about kids !
14331,"yes , i thought that was a very good thing they did ."
14332,i like to think about how sony must feel y not buying marvel when they had the chance .
14333,"oh gosh , yeah they would have done so well if theyd id ."
14334,hi good evening . you like marvel comics ?
14335,yup . super big any . did you see avengers infinity war ?
14336,yes i di . great film . it was the 1t9hf old in the marvel cinematic universe !
14337,what did you think of the ending ? guess everyone was waiting for tat big thanos moment .
14338,ending was crazy . thanos was such a good villain josh brolin did a fantastic job !
14339,right ? ! ? i mean thee entire cast is great . did any of the deaths shock you ? the one that hit me the hardest was spiderman . but did't feel too bad . i mean he 's got a sequel coming so it ca n't be ll taht bad for those ho ' died . '
14340,"yeah that was crazy , although i do n't remember him dying ? did hes age iron man right ? sort is the only company with rights to spiderman ."
14341,"spidy died cord ' vanished . ' hi was the one wher he was humbling and said , ' i do n't feel so good mr . stark . ' glad sony and marvel worked out shoes kind of deal . wa really happy with tom holland . you hav any favorite actors i nthe marvel universe ?"
14342,oh yeah now i remember . . . tom holland wa agreat better than toby imo . i love chris hemsworth as thor . he is such a good god ! also ragnarok was so epic .
14343,"funny , my little girl loves ragnarok wh ad to double heck if she was starting to like boys because she keeps saying thor disc do ! i 'm really impressed y the way marvel has so many different kinds of characters ."
14344,"haha everyone likes thor i think . . they do . i like how lou ferrigno , the original hulk , has made some appearances as wall ."
14345,"isnt ' that area no i had read the lou ferrigno had a hearing problem . interestingly , marvel created a superhero named blue ear specifically for a 4 year old boy who told is mom superheroes fo n't wear hearing ads ."
14346,wow that is so heartbeat of the . marvel is very smart . they even argued in court once that mutants are not people ! it was in regards to thrid toy licensing .
14347,"man when marvel was acquired by disney back in 2005 i thought that would be a big business mistake wb ut as you say , the know what they 're doing ."
14348,yes exactly . but disney does't own the rights to the big marvel characters in theme parks east of the mississippi !
14349,ha . the way disney owns everything it 's almost as if they 're heir own universe ! or maybe they 're the sun adn everything revolves around them
14350,great comparison ! there is even one character owned by both marvel and dc named access ! his purpose is to keep the two universes separate !
14351,wow . that 's pretty cool . think marvel
14352,i am just glad sony didnt nd up buying the rights to all of marvel back in 1998 ! well have a good one it was nice chatting with you !
14353,thanks . sorry meant to say in the last post that i think marvel'sb eating dc overall right not . trink stan lee did a great job pushing marvel forward . though a lot of credit does go to steve ditto and jack girly .
14354,"no problem , and yes i totally agree . marvel . also rip stan lee ! have a good one !"
14355,ahve you watched infinity war ?
14356,"i did , i though it wa a great movie , it integrated characters perfectly , did hyou watch it ? did you like it ?"
14357,i did not likd did . i do n't like marvel movies that much . i have been watching the punisher . i like the marvel series a lot better .
14358,"the punisher is a great serie , did you also watched daredevil , iron fist , luke cage ? those re also pretty good"
14359,"sorry , i meant i have not watched infinity war . yes , i have watched luck cage . i also liked jessica jones . was that marvel too ? and i have not watched the rest but i will have to check them out . it 's cool that so many characters were in infinity wars though ."
14360,"many superheroes indeed , my favorite iron man . infinity war definetely made history , its the first one to be shot with only digital imax cameras ,"
14361,movies do n't hold my attention as much as series . i 'm not sure i could sit through infinity wars since it 's over two and a half hours long .
14362,"it is pretty long but i think its a lot watch movie , the vast isp best many of my favorite actors are in the movie and iron ma just crack same up"
14363,af least it seems like hte characters are relatable . i heard that the best moments are are ones that were focused on the characters .
14364,"i think its interesting how characters can be bad in one , one but then become good in the next time bucks barnes in te winter soldier , did you watch that movie ?"
14365,"no , i have n't watched that movie . i know what you mean though ."
14366,there is weird fact about the avengers but somehow the movie caused shawarma slaves to increase .
14367,"hmm , was that on the movie ?"
14368,"i think in the end of the first movie of the avengers the wheel team goes to a small shawarma joint to eat , maybe that why the sales increased ! one thing i know for sure an ethan is hat im staring to get hungry lol"
14369,"haha , yeah , that is making me hungry too . speaking of foot , oddly , i remember watching the hulk series when i was younger , surfing dinner . the actor who played the hulk khan been voicing the character ever since then including every apperance up to avengers age of ultron ."
14370,"thats na interestin fact indeed , so theres this popular character called jarvis , so the character that plays his voice has never watched the films either so you are not alone lol"
14371,"wow , that is crazy . maybe it just kind of ruins it if you 're an author in the franchise ."
14372,"i guess that could be a bummer , i wonder where the franchise guts . their ideas from ? i bet they had the universe as a source of their jnsp5ation for sure"
14373,are there any holograms in the marvel series ? there is a story that the universe may be one giant superhologram .
14374,"yes , there ar hologram si nthe movies and that is one crazy theory not sure if thats the right one but im willing o remain open minded lol"
14375,"kin doof a scary thought , but did of cool ."
14376,"hello , are you a fan of superhero movies ?"
14377,"yes , i 've seen a few . i really like ironman , and it is funny to see taht eh use to hide food on the ocean"
14378,"that 's interesting , i 'm sure htey must have had fun with that . speaking o food , i know th avengers caused an increase in shawarma sales ."
14379,really ? i wonder what that is ?
14380,no sure . have you seen avengers : infinity war ?
14381,n't . did you ? i 'm sure it 's good . all of them are . do many stars in one film .
14382,"i have seen it , i thought th technological length were impressive . it was the first film shot entirely with digital imax cameras ."
14383,wow . that would be fun to watch in imax theater . k was interested to find that disney does not of the rights to them marvel characters like spiderman .
14384,"that 's interesting , i have also heard sony was offered exclusive rights to all their characters , but only purchased he rights to spiderman because they did n't think people would care about other characters ."
14385,really . that seems to have been a big mistake for sony . the plots to these movies a all the same basically . ; . tight for good against evil .
14386,"i agree , are yet they last forever seemingly . the same for who originally voiced the hulk in the 1970 's has voiced the character for decades since ."
14387,"really ? each of the heroes have their own personalities . i like the hulk , too . the winter soldier must have been a good guy at one time , is that right ?"
14388,"i 'm not sure ! the most interesting character i know is access , it 's one diy both marvel and dc , and it 's only purposes is tho keep the two companies separate ."
14389,"do you know that in reality , the universe is amazing and here may even b another universe in a black hole ?"
14390,"that 's interesting , people have their theories about everything in the universe . i 've heard on that then is only one electron in the whole universe !"
14391,amazing ! there are lots of sounds out there int he universe . it 's thought state in a book hole the sound that is 57 octaves blow middle c is emitted .
14392,"i wonder how they measure somethng like that . it would e interesting to measure outside the observable universe , where a region of space might be pulling galaxies outsiders ."
14393,only god knows . i 've heard there are sounds that come from other parts of the salaries . recorded ! !
14394,"that 's scary to think honestly . i 've heard the universe may only be one giant superhologram , maybe that would mean even these sounds are fictional too ."
14395,wow ! ! ! am i a part of a superhologram ?
14396,"what knows ? scientists theorize universes evolve through natural selection , maybe one da we 'll figure out something definite . anyways it was nic talking to yiu , have a good night !"
14397,hi ! are you a superhero fan ?
14398,hi ! i am a huge fan of infinity war ! rid you1 not it was the first film to be shot 100 percent on imax cameras ? that is so cool !
14399,i had heard that . i also had that they killed off a few it characters .
14400,"it 's crazy , is n't it ? i also think it 's crazy that there was an increase in shawarma sales thanks to the avengers !"
14401,i know ! that is pretty crazy that it had that in of influence .
14402,agreed ! but the you have people like the it who voiced jarvis in the avengers and irony an films who ' e never rewatched any of the movies . can you believe that ?
14403,"that is odd , i am sure lou ferrigno has sew many o 'the hulk films since he started voicing the character ."
14404,"i 'm sure he hs . ha ! i 'm also sure the waitress in avengers taht captain america saves , who also voiced the character gretchen in recess , has been the films as well !"
14405,i think it actors sr actresses do . i guess some guy that to be done with them .
14406,"i do n't blame them one bit . acting has to be stressful . i also wonde row stressful a scientist 's job is ? speaking of scientists , did you know there are some who theorize universes actually evolve through natural selection like different species do here on earth ?"
14407,"yeah ! i think contemplaing the universe is great , especially if we are alone in i t !"
14408,"indeed it is ! speaking of the universe , you know it could simply be one massive superhologram !"
14409,wouldnt that be interesting ! i think there is stuff beyond what we even know .
14410,"i do as well . you know , there 's also a theory stating there 's only one electron in the entire universe ! that is pretty interesting if you ask me !"
14411,"it is , as well as stars sk cold we could touch them !"
14412,"that would be awesome to do ! they also say there 's a part of space that could possibly be pulling galaxies outside the observable universe . that is crazy , isnt ' it ?"
14413,it is ! i think the universe is always expanding and that might eb why .
14414,"it could be . plus even though the spatial size of the universe is unknown , it 's still possible to measure the observable universe !"
14415,"which , in itself , is crazy to me . this seemingly infinite space can be measured we ron ' steve know if there is other life , but we know where it might be ."
14416,"it is , crazy . here are so many questions and contradictions , it 's hard to keep up ! well we talked about tha marvel ' universe ' earlier , but did you know there 's a character both c and marvel owns called access who las created to help both dc and marvel universes separate ?"
14417,"i would need his help telling them apart . lol . it 's bee nic chatting , but i must get going ."
14418,"that suprised me they both own a character and yet , disney doe n't own the rights to the big named marvel characters in all the theme parks east of teh mississippi because , in the 1990s , marvel signed a contract with universal studios . well i was nice chatting with you as well ! one you have a great day , friend !"
14419,you as well q
14420,do you play video games ?
14421,"you know , i ' older . i actually played pong when it came out and pacman , but i have n't in 30 years . do you play , much experience in them ? shocking to me that jalen mcgonigal calculated we plan 3 billion hours of video games a week as a planet ."
14422,"intresting . i 've plated pong , my first game system was an actor ."
14423,"i read somewhere that atari had 52 or 64 colors , pong had two on my the old tv my dad had in the basement . low tech indeed , have yo played fortnite ? seems like a big deal in gamer circles ."
14424,"i think it was nintendo . i ' v never played fortnite , i don ' even know what it is to be honest ."
14425,"well that makes two of us , those players probably do n't know what you is or was . i have heard of minecraft , and again nerve player . a world bitter tan neptune it 's reported , at you familiar with that at all ?"
14426,"interesting , how is hat possible ?"
14427,"i have no idea , i assume you s amazon though ; youse lee here jed bezos built a clock into a mountain , run 10 , 000 year in we ' l now see that one run out of winding or battery , nor our gradnkds ."
14428,i use amazon too . do you know if it is an atomic clock ?
14429,"i assume it is , i do n't think we have battery technology for 10 . 000 years , if we did you 'd never have to charge an electric car andre it would run your whole life . jeff bezos had some problems with the national enquirer recently , he might have wanted to hide in his warehouse . you see the workers walks 786 miles a day , they would n't need a gym membership ."
14430,"yeah , i do n't think so either . i did n't know that amazon owned imdb ."
14431,"yes , kind of makes use if they 're selling movies and video 's . you see that first amazon customer spent 27 . 95 in 1994 and got a building named after him . i did n't know that , had you heard that or know his or her name ?"
14432,"i 'm not sure , i 've never heard of this . i know amazon gets a special deal with the usps l"
14433,"yes , i assume bulk savings as they might . the usps biggest customer . it make sense to me , you see there the first video games were called , ' cathode ray tube amusement devices ' and used by the military . i assume flight simulastor or night goggles vision fighting , something like . you think they had any idea it would e the start of a car billion dollar industry worldwide ?"
14434,i 'm not sure . i wonder if we could get a similar is deal ?
14435,"i really doubt it unless you ship a lot more things than i do . you see where it 's illeagle fo kids under 16 to play video games ins mouth korea after midnight , tht a good idea , especially on school nights but how would the government enforce that , seems like parents should know that already and want their young kids asleep at midnight , ?"
14436,apparently as a planet we play 3 billion hours of video games a week .
14437,"yes , and since i play none there 's a few out there playing ga lot to run the total up . you see where amazon is the third most valuable company in the us by market capitalization . i mean they make me electronic devices , they really must hip goods from manufacturers to consumers . i do n't think its good that they 're so valuable as imply a shipping firm ."
14438,"i did n't know that jim hank dos woody 's voice in video games , did you ?"
14439,"neither did i , you think the hanks family sits around the table at thanksgiving using their various movie voices ? that s pretty amazing mainly , but tom seem like a pretty normal guy ."
14440,they seem like they would ge cool people to get to know .
14441,are you a fan of video games ?
14442,"hi , yes i love video ads , from classic games to newer games liek hitchhikers guide to teh galaxy which is surprisingly good ."
14443,i never knew that was an actual game ! video games were called cathode ray tube amusement devices when first invented
14444,huh i did n't know that . yeah it ' sa great game and stephen fry does narration in the video game too . you should check it out .
14445,i will check it out . i watched the movie but now i need to play the game
14446,fry also does narration in the harry potter games . most of which are actually very good usually movie or book video games are n't good but they are great .
14447,"i am sure i can buy it on amazon , i love amazon , do you ?"
14448,"can ' g go wrong with lame day shipping , or sunday deliveries . i 've been buying on amazon since they where a bookstore ."
14449,"i love same day shipping , it started off as w book sale company ."
14450,yeah i said i 've been buying since they were s book store . its amazing they can zip all this heady stuff for free . teh first customer who bought from them got a building named after them !
14451,"you can get everything ons sunday , they hae a contract with the usps to ship on sunday"
14452,yeah . they are so big an only getting bigger . i like that they 've branched out to other things like owning a publishing company .
14453,"for sure , they are o rich and her bezos i too ! i heart har people thay work at amazon walk between 7 and 15 miles per day as part of their shift"
14454,they get a lot of bad press or that but i find that hard the believe . i 'm sure most people drive machines across the building . i 've worked in bi warehouses before .
14455,"me too , thet do n't walk that much , otherwise they would be so skinny ! did you know imdb is owned by amazon"
14456,i did not . i wonder what they want with imdb . i d n't think that website makes a lot of money .
14457,"for sure lol i was thinking the same thing . i wish i was the first person to buy something from amazon , they have a building named after them"
14458,i told you that a minute ago ! they spent 27 . 95
14459,"sorry must have missed that , good heating with you !"
14460,"you too , go buy the game on amazon ."
14461,"i will , thanks ! bye !"
14462,"have you heard of the popular game called fortnite ? the name of the game is survival here players fighter a other though zombies and find materials to build shelters , do you play ? '"
14463,my kid plays it constantly with all his friends . i guess that is partly why it takes up 12 . 8 percent of traffic to the gaming platform . it beat to the top of the charts quickly in the us and a bunch of other countries .
14464,"yes , it was an international obsession with over 150 millie players worldwide ! it 's so the ostwatched game on twitch , did you know that amazon owns that site , twitch . it 's where people upload streaming of games ."
14465,even basketball champions are referencing the game with their victories . i ca n't figure out why though as 8 personally ca n't stan the game .
14466,"i never got into it , but a lot of my coworker who are also sports fans talk about it . overall , i think gaming ahs become more mainstream m , seem like there 's at least one sort of gaming console in a lot of households these days ."
14467,"pop star drake even plays the game and got 622 , 000 viewers on twitch to view time and ' ninja a . '"
14468,i hope he did n't feel kids up past midnight because it is legal for kids 6 and under in south korea to play video games past midnight . i wonder ho theyd monitor o enforce that though .
14469,"sounds scary though to be caught . but if jane mcgonigal scan calculate thati s a planet we play three billion hour to video games per week , maybe they can monitor kids in south korea ."
14470,"yeah , wonder what the punishment is , but see , s like kids who play video games can stimualte their creative brains like minecraft who partnered with inhabitant to let kids resign changes they want to see in the games ."
14471,the military even used video games called ' cathode ray tube amusement devices . ' probably those games were more for a combat mission junction . i wonder if the designers of those games woudl babe liked fortnite .
14472,or be inspired fro mode game ! it 's pretty cool fact taht tom honks ' brother actually does wood 's voice in the video games version of the game . they do have very ditinguishablev vocal cords .
14473,"wow , that is interesting ! do you play minecraft ? nc school in sweden requires minecraft lessons . i think my children will want to move there soon ."
14474,"haha , kids might actually look forward to school ! no , i do not play minecraft but that world is bigger than neptune which i forget is the which largest planet in the solar system in terms of sank ."
14475,i think it is great that kids can have a chance to make their world more environmentally friendly with un habitat partnering with minecraft to let kids make designs of ways to change the environment for the better .
14476,"yes , i agree . considering that minecraft is the third best selling video game of all time , i think their very noclue for being back to the community ."
14477,i would ask amazon to deliver minecraft to my childrens sometime when they ask me currently foe it on a boring weekend . they have a contract with the post office .
14478,"begin great they 're the largest internet retailer in the world , they sure would be able to do that . i admire jeff bezos for what an amazing business he has built , i must admit i use a lot of services amazon offers ."
14479,those who work for amazon do a great job and work really hard . they must really be in shape walking 715 miles a day on their shifts .
14480,"yeah , that 's a physically demanding job , amazon offers so many product s , i i n't know that they also owned imdb , no wonder its integrated in tshirt prime videos . would be netflix to offer that as well ."
14481,"i remember when amazon was just selling books and now it has grown so much . they have audiobooks , video downloads , video games , electronics , even had ! i love to shop on amazon . com"
14482,"me too ! they even offer lowend products under its inhouse brand amazonbasics , but i have tried some of their products and think their quite qualitative for the price point ."
14483,nice talking to you . i think i 'll go shop on amazon now for some new furniture !
14484,some theorists think of video games as a artwork . i would mostly disagree with that !
14485,"yes , they are definitely n expression of art ! did you know that tom hanks brother jim does voices in video games ?"
14486,i did n't know that . in south korea it is illegal for kids under 16 to play video game softer midnight . wish that were true here too
14487,"yes i agree with that , kids are staying up all night on their device snow days !"
14488,i think it is funny that the military called video games cathode ray tube amusement devices . carted acronym i 'm sure .
14489,"yep , there is also a school in sweden with actual minecraft lessons being taught !"
14490,oh no . video games in school not a good idea . lol minecraft is the 3rd best selling video game of all time though .
14491,i 'm not surprised abou tthat ! ad . . . someone actually built a working 16 bit computer using only minecraft building blocks ! wow .
14492,crazy . how is the minecraft world bigger thank tune ? i do n't get that . . ; .
14493,"i do n't understand that one actually , i wa just wondering about tha t ! i see that amazon named a building after their very first customer who spent 27 . 95"
14494,must be theoretical or something . it 's hard to imagine that amazon is still called than alibaba .
14495,"i did n't kow that it was smaller , interesting . i also did n't know that amazon and the post office have a deal to deliver amazon packages to their customers on sunday ."
14496,i get amazon prime deliveries al the time on sunday . aws is their fastest growing subsidiary providing web or cloud based services .
14497,"i have prime also , i 've just never received a box on a sunday . i wonder wh jeff bezos built a clock into am sustain that would run for 10 , 000 years ? seems like a waste of money when people go hungry each day here in america ."
14498,"strange . i guess hungry people will need to know the time too , but seems excessive for sure . i did not know imdb was owned ba amazon . seems they have a hidden base of information here ."
14499,"i did't knot that either . amazon employees must be in pretty good halt , they walk on average at work , retweet 7 and 15 miles ."
14500,i just was reading that too . must be a job requirement to be in good health too . do n't want people hurting themselves on the job .
14501,"true . . . . lol . have you ever bought any of the ' house ' products , amazonbasics ?"
14502,"no , i dd n't know amazon basics was a thing but if they are cheaper and basic i would try . wonder if they offer on prime ?"
14503,"i 'm pretty sure they do offer tiem or prime , i 'm going to find out . i havent ' tried them yet , but i have seen them on their website ."
14504,"cool , i 'll look into it too . i 'd rather talk about amazon and not video games myself ."

14526,"shhh yes hat one was so cute ! it 's been a pleasure chatting . have a great night o ray : ,"
14527,i never saw black panther . i love angela bassett

14529,did you know the richest superhero is actually black panther
14530,yes who has an estimated of 500 billion
14531,"i do get t confused with the black panther party ,"
14532,i did too at firt . did you now that teh symbols based on an actual script called nsibdi ?
14533,yes it goes back to the 4th century
14534,correct . chadwick boseman almost went to oxford . he must be smart

14539,that wasnt ice of them to them up with a hearing aid wearing hero
14540,that as nice . i as for a 4 year old boy
14541,i have never heard of the hero names access
14542,me either . they made it to try to keep both companies ' universes separate
14543,did you know that frozen was the first animated disney film directed by a woman
14544,"ho i did not . they recycled a lo of theyd animation frames , err lol time ago"
14545,ye that was back in the 70 's
14546,and they make the toys before they make the movies
14547,i hold like to see the line king in zulu
14548,have you seen the black panther movie ?
14549,"i have , and i did n't care for it . i do like the fact that one of the tribal elders , made her acting debut at 88 ."
14550,that 's cool . i heard that another relegated film too lion king was the first disney film to be dubbed into zulu .
14551,"yes , isnt hat amzing ? chadwick boseman 's benefactor was denzel , washington . he thanked him at the premiere of black panther . that was sweet of hi m ."
14552,i did n't know that but i heard that the script came one dating back to th 19th century in an area round current nigeria .
14553,"ish ave not heart hat . i think its cute that moral created a superhero with a blue ear , just for a little boy who was uncomfortable wearing hearing aids . i wonder ow much stan lee played a part in that ."
14554,i ca n't believe stan lee is dead . i wonder if the movie ill be as good without his input .
14555,"i miss him on twitter . i hop is , there are so many stories left to tell . i 'm glad michael jackson was n't able to buy marvel ."
14556,jackson bought all the rights to the beatles music . i wonder who in his family owns them now . that 's a lot of moeny . i ca n't believe marvel offered sony for 25 million but turned i own . they have lots billions .
14557,"i think some of the catalog was auctioned of to pay delhi . or , they went to his kids . i do n't get why sony did that . anyway , at least jackson was never able to play spider man in his own movie ."
14558,i did n't know bill recently disney acquired marvel . that os a smart company to keep going all these years .
14559,"disney does a lot of did things . big hero 6 , ws created on a superb computer ."
14560,"yeah , they do n't like cartoons like they used to . it is all computer generated . but i was surprised to learn frozen was their first film directed by a woman ."
14561,! 's insane that it took them that long . did you know that dr . strange 's character is based on sir isaac newton ?
14562,"i did n't . i guess that i where htey got that werid cape from he wears . looking at old painting of him . i did n't know newton could travel through time . oh wait , no he create gravity , oh wait , or was that applesuce from the apple that fell on his head ."
14563,"he 's thye gravity guy , lol . i guess if you are not in the head hard enough , you can travel through time . after all , he was once a sorcerer supreme ."
14564,"hmm , that is true . if you get hit in the head . go into a comic and wake up ten years later you have traveled 10 years into the future as far as your reality he . when you go to sleep at night for travel 8th ours into the future use you do n't realize the time as passed if you do n't wake up threw hole time ."
14565,"andc hen when you wake up , you are t'challa , king of wakanda ."
14566,"i never heard comic books as a kid . did you know that marvel got to pay a lower rate on xmen toys since they are not human , as opposed to human dolls ?"
14567,"i didn ; now that . had the mcu of failed , ferrell lynch would have ended up owning captain america and teh rest of the avengers ."
14568,"interesting , its ' all about moeny . i cna't believe black panther is supposed to have 500 billion , while stark only has 100 billion , wayne a punny 80 ."
14569,"well , sure is a better inventor tha son . my problem with the movie , is that they rushed it . i think they could have done a much better job , had they of taken their time wth it ."
14570,"well , i am sure there will be many more . lots of comics out there . lots of material . at one time they tried to ban comics cause they thought they made kids violent ."
14571,"thank you for chatting with me , it has been nice . enjoy your night ."
14572,i have learned a lot bout black panther from you . thanks .
14573,you are welcome .
14574,hey are you a black panther fan ? it seemed to be a cult classic !
14575,i have heard a lot about it ! i know t'challa is crowned king of aknaada following his father 's death .
14576,yep you 're right . actually black panther is considered the richest superhero too .
14577,i ponder how such he is ?
14578,ne has an estimate 2500 billion ! ! ! that is dirty rich !
14579,that is a lot of money . and i thought disney was a big deal !
14580,yeah same with me . marvel is just as big . in 1998 they actualy offered teh cinematic rights of their characters to sony !
14581,wow um area is the company that created superhero blue car for the boy that had to wear hearing aids but told his mom superheroes do not read hearing aids . marvel heard it and created te character .
14582,that is so nice of hem . marvel actually argued in court once that mutants are not people !
14583,was that the case fought to pay a lower rate on toys instead of a higher rate o dolls ?
14584,yes thats the one ! i think they won !
14585,good for them ! i know marvel branding began in 1961 .
14586,thats a lot of years of making money ! disney actually does n't own the rights to show popular marble characters in thee parks east of the mississippi !
14587,"oh , interesting . wait , is that due to a contract ?"
14588,yeah they signed the contract with universal studios back in the 0 's !
14589,oh tha way a long time ago ! marvel started as timely productions .
14590,interesting . sounds like they then progressed to becoming atlas comic . . ;
14591,"yes , they might have . so back to disney , frozen was hte first animated film directed by a woman ."
14592,wow talk about starving off 30th a and ! ! that was a great movie . another first wa when lion kin dubbed into zulu for its african release .
14593,i loved lion king ! i know during the 1970 's disney recycled a lot of their frames resulting in identical scenes in some movies .
14594,yea i heard about tht . the top industry also sounds like they anticipate the movies ! nice talking to you friend .
14595,do you know many facts about voting ?
14596,hmmm . how about that too 2012 election was the fist that did n't have a veteran on either party 's ticket ?
14597,good point ! did you know that the indian gov't sets up a polling booth in a forest fu ; ll of lions for a single vote ? i kind of fins that hard to elie because as far as i know there are only tigers in india .
14598,haha ; well themed dunce was a dog that beat two people in an election for mayor then served 1 years ! wonder what city what was .
14599,"what are the odds of that ? hahah the citizens of austin , tx once voted to rename their garbage dump after fred durst !"
14600,ac at named hank placed third in a senate election in virginia . what is it with people voting for animals ?
14601,that 's funny ! lol astronauts can vote from space . that 's a good thing !
14602,always good when people can vote . ow about this one there candidate who blinks the fastest has lost every presidential debate since 1980 . hat 's a crazy stat .
14603,how in the heck did someone even decide to eat tracking that did ? wow . lol
14604,i was thinking the same thing . another animal letting votes in 1988 a chimp came in third place for mayor of rio de janeiro .
14605,"that 's funny ! 34 percent of the black male population on alabama has permanently , posts he right to vote !"
14606,"that 'd tragic . hopefully they can pass legislation to correct that . speaking of alabama , 40 percent of voters voted to continue thye legal an on interracial marriage and this was in 2000 ."
14607,"thay 's crazy . when arnold schwarzenegger was governor of ca , he would fly by private et 3 hours every day to sacremento ."
14608,"man , thats ' quite a commute . jfk , who is widely remembered for his work to advance civil rights , actually voted against the 1957 civil rights act ."
14609,intersting ! texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment .
14610,"that 's awesome . in south carolina , n atheistg hannity be governor . that 's insane ."
14611,"crazy indeed ! in 1934 , north dakota governor declared martial law nad seceded from the us . never heard that before ;"
14612,"i 've never feared that either . in kentucky , you ca n't be governor i you ' v lever participated in a duel . i guess that rules me out . haha ."
14613,what ? that is an odd one for sure ! the beatles wrote ' come together ' for timothy leary 's 1969 ca governor campaign . it 's been fun chatting with you !
14614,you too !
14615,have a good ay !
14616,good afternoon to . 's think it 's very important to vote in elections what about you ? elections have ben operating since the 17th century .
14617,"it is a great process of decision , king for citizens to choose who gets to hold a public office . democracy is great !"
14618,yes democracy is indeed the best no doubt . officials in ancient athens were appointed by lottery because they believed elections would lead to an oligarchy . boy were they wrong .
14619,yeah electoral reform was definitely needed to improve the fairness of hates process for sure .
14620,i definitely agree . another weird thing is that since 1900 the taller candidate has won the us presidential reelection 75 percent of thet i . now that i think of it trump was taller than hillary .
14621,"hmmm , that is so weird . not as weird as a cat named hank who placed 3rd in a virginia senate reelection . lol"
14622,yeh as not have been very good candidates . the other turn out for us presidential elections has n't breached 6 2 . 8 percent in hte last 100 years . that 's too bad .
14623,"very probably not . so like th taller candidate winning 75 percent of the time , the faster blinker in the presidential debates has lost every election since 1980 . i wonder who sits around and counts the blinking ?"
14624,yea hi need to know who is coming up at the stats ! nevada is the only state to have a non soft these candidates voting option for presidential elections .
14625,so do i . i like te way oregon works . all their elections are conducted by mail so you do n't even have to leave the house to vote .
14626,wow that is so convenient 2 almost like astronauts voting from space .
14627,yes just like tat . apparently people like animals more than some politicians . a dog beat two amyorila candidates and actually served 2013 years as mayor .
14628,"ha ha that is hilarious . i 1944 , north dakota 's governor declared martial aw and seceded from the us . i did n't even knkow that was legal !"
14629,"do n't laugh too much at the dog . in rio de janeiro , a chimpanzee got 400 , 000 votes and came in 3rd in another mayoral race . those mayors must be horrible people ."
14630,wow that is so amazing ! how does that even happen ? when arnold schwarzenegger was governor of california he commute three hours every day by private jet . not exactly environmentally friendly .
14631,wore you the right about that . in kentucky you can only become governor if you have never participated in a duel . who even does stat anymore ?
14632,ha ha that is some ol school rules right there . do you remember the beatles song come together ' ? it was written for a california governor campaign !
14633,"really , how cool . the governor of ok has a pool shaped like the estate . i think that is awesome ."
14634,yeah that is very patriotic . texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment . it was the second elected female in ther nation ! it was nice converting with you ! i hope you have a good evening .
14635,"girl power ! : , i like how is , critics is progressing in that way . same here . bye !"
14636,by e !
14637,hey there did you vote in the last election ?
14638,"i died not , i would have probably selected ' none of these candidates ? option if i was in nevada"
14639,"yep i would do that too . i think that 's an option everyone shoudl have , would you new live in ancient athens ? apparently they would do elections like a lottery"
14640,seem like they were trying to avoid oligarchy to form !
14641,the it 's apparently so . it 's kind of sad that voter turnout mates out at 63 percent in the united states . what 7percent do you think it should be ?
14642,"not sure but people just don trust navy politician anymore . did you k , now astronauts ca note from space ?"
14643,"wow that 's really cool ! another thing that i did n't know is that the taller presidential candidate has won 75 percent of the time since the year 1900 , so the democrats should definitely rub a basketball player lol"
14644,i am wondering i that is a coincidence because it has happened for more than 100 years and 75 percent is a high percentage
14645,yep i agree with you . i ponder which election was won by the shorter candidate actually haha . did you hear that in 2012 international election observers were blocked in nine states from viewing the polls ? why would that be
14646,what sounds pretty strange ! it is strange also that a garbage dump wa shamed after fred durst in that was voted by the citizens of austin tx
14647,"that is pretty funny . i guess if you are fred durst you would be kind of embarrassed , but you have to mush money you just do n't even care lol"
14648,"that is true , they are just happy to make headlines , did you know how the indian government put a voting booth in a forest full of lions ?"
14649,"no i didnt now that . that 's super nice of them though . what is it nice is that 34 percent of the black population in alabama , specifically males , m lost their right to vote permanently"
14650,"that is crazy , talking about must , i did not know that the beatles 's come together was written for a political campaign !"
14651,"no i did n't know that either . are there any governors that you like ? i remember when schwarzenegger was governor of california , apparently he would commute to work everyday"
14652,"he commuted 3 hours wow , that is such a long commute , and it was i na jet !"
14653,"yep in a jet , s news like a waste of money especially for all but oh well , did you ever about the governor who seceded from the united states ?"
14654,i heard something happened in 1934 in north dakota . i wonder why that occurred ?
14655,yes i wonder what caused him to do that . very interesting that texas had a female governor before the 19th amenmden nwas ratified . that 's impressive
14656,that was somehting ou tofu thur ordinary ! ! and it was te second in the nation !
14657,"yep that 's why i think it was so impressive ! also impressive was the guy ralph lawrence carr . he actually opposed in turning the japaneseamericans during world war ii , tha as probably not a popular opinion back then"
14658,"i try not to involve myself everyday with politics because it can be so negative , but i felt really proud to vote in the recent midterm elections . voting is so important for u sas a group ."
14659,"i feel the same , so much negativity , but in order to enact have we must vote ."
14660,its crazy to think that voter turnout has n't exceeded 62 . 8 percent tin tie last century .
14661,"i think many people are disenfrnachised with thee candidates . nevada has it right , they ahve a none of these candidates option . . if we could vote for that and the get new peopple it would be awesome !"
14662,"i 'm not sure how i feel about that . sometimes having that option with a group tat feels like everything gigs back and white , or blue and red , so to speak , when ot voting for lighter would take away votes from the other candidates . if voter turnout was better , maybe we could really have a shot of a multiparty election . astronauts even make sure to note fro myspace !"
14663,certainly there is something we and to do to ge better turnout . but there are so many who cant vote . like the 34 percent of black men i nalaabma
14664,maybe athens hd something right about just having a lottery to elect a candidate ? it does seem like we 're heading toward being an oligarchy with the copying system as it is .
14665,true . beatles have written some campaign songs . i ego timothy leary 's 1969 governor campaign
14666,"yeah , come together is one of my favorite beatles songs ,"
14667,there was a governor that once declared martial law and seceded from the us ? back in 1934 .
14668,i believe it was north dakota . i wonder why the united states let them back in ?
14669,"i dont know , maybe it is part of the constitution that states cant do that ? or the people of th estate voted to get back in ?"
14670,i know it 's in the texas constitution that the can secede . texas is more progressive than people realize ep it hadnt he second female governor in the nation before some states even ratified the 19th amendment .
14671,"really , i didnt know that was part of the texas constitution . im from florida , the one state that cant seem to do a neectio fend footing correctly ."
14672,"teach , and a lot of people think colorado has always been pretty progressive , too . ralph lawrence carr was the only governor who subjected to japaneseamerican internment camps during world war 2 . can yo believe tha ?"
14673,no . that is pretty crazy
14674,"not crazier than austin , tx voting torn rename their city dump to fred durst . napa !"
14675,i ca n't believe they could actually vote to do that . that is wild .
14676,apparently k the taller presidential cadnidzte has won 75 percent o the time . hope the next person him taller than stump !
14677,for real . lets start searching .
14678,i just wish they would ; t make voting so hard for some people and we could have s shot . some people waited for up to 5 hours to vote in georgia a .
14679,"that is outlandish . if astronauts an vote fro sauce , surely we can figure it out here on earth . anyway , ive got to go . have a good night !"
14680,do you like to play video games ?
14681,"i do , but i don ? t play much . do you ?"
14682,"i do n't play much either but have an xbox love , i think hat game fe can be an interesting choice for a weekend"
14683,did you know playstation 3s as being used to research black holes ?
14684,"they are ? thats amazing , i wonder what hey use play stations instead of supercomputers"
14685,the us dept of defense used 1760 ps3 's to build a supercomputer because it was cheaper than the alternative 2
14686,i see thats a creative solution did you ever play grand theft auto ?
14687,yes ! did you ? i heard the playstation game plays the soundtrack in a c player .
14688,"i payed it but never tried to reproduce the game in a cd player , it was a great game though"
14689,agreed . do you like animals ?
14690,"i do like animals , there are 20 quintillion of them on the planet !"
14691,crazy ! the study of animals is called zoology . i i studied that more in school !
14692,"i do too , there are many interesting facts like how nails develop white patches on their foreheads once they are domesticated"
14693,also that in 2002 germany was the first country to give animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rights .
14694,"i guess thats a nice thing to do , some people treat animals like trash and its not like they can fight back , especially if they are small and defenseless ."
14695,agreed . what is your favorite animal ?
14696,"my favorite animals aired dogs i asl like birds , do you have a preference ?"
14697,birds are just oh so fascinating . did you know most birds bones weigh less than their feathers ?
14698,"wow thats interesting , i never knew that about birds although the must have light skeletons in order to fly , must be difficult to fly with a lot of weight on them ."
14699,hummingbirds actually steal spiderwebs to build and repair their nests !
14700,"i get spiders must hate them he , that sounds messed up , poor spiders after all that hard work . . . ."
14701,i would be pissed if i was a spider .
14702,"? now right , theres not much spiders can do about it so yea h ."
14703,hey did you know that scientists are usig ps3 's to research the magic of black holes ?
14704,i think that scientist spare lying ! they 're just playing games on those ps3s ! lol
14705,haha i want that job ! do you play any videogames at all ?
14706,i used to play . not so much now . he lux dodloves the wo . it used 1760 of them to build a supercomputer because it was cheaper thay the alternative . what was the alternative ? ps2 ?
14707,"ahha ya it would take 10 , 000 of those probably ! ya i used to play too , i think it 's cool you could play the grand theft auto game disc in a cd player to ever the soundtrack"
14708,"changing topics from the mechanical to teh biological , d id you know that there are about 20 , 000 , 00 0 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 individuals animals on the planet ? humans beings and their play stations are such a small part of the king world ."
14709,"ah i didnt know that , i wonder what kind of videogames other animals would pals ? haah , i do think it 's interesting that in germany animals have legal rights , lie i wonder what they are , do they have hte right to vote l , etc haha"
14710,"perhaps then can vote if they have white patches on their foreheads . animals develop white patches on their foreheads when domesticated . i do not have a white patch on my forehead , yet i feel domesticated . do you have a white patch h ? there 's no shame in it these days ."
14711,"haha let me top in the mirror and check , that is weird , like we have a dog and it is all black with no white hatch bu what do i know , i 'm drinking soda and have the hiccups , i guess that is a leftover from when animals had both gills and lungs apparently"
14712,"you would still have rights in germany though , no matter what holdovers from your ancestors . under the 1912 scottish protection of animals act , the loch ness monster is a protected species ."
14713,do you think that the loch ness monster is real ? i want it to be real can a protected animal nut to be honest . really really do n't think it is haha
14714,the fictional beast has more protections than i do . i 'm envious .
14715,"haha , and more protections han the dodo bird who went extinct sadly , i didnt ' know it was a piece of pigeon actually"
14716,"the dodo was not terribly clever . australia has some weird creatures , like wi , d birds that can mimic the sounds of cameras , car alarms , and chainsaws . i wonder if they have australian accents ."
14717,"ahha good question , i would e scared to be walking , then hearing an australian chainsaw , i 'd think i was being chased by a murderer out to find it was a harmless bird haha"
14718,the bird might steal something from you to build a nest . hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to build nad repair their nests .
14719,"haha the spider need spider police ! what is crazy , thet a byrds ' skeleton weighs less than the feathers , i would n't have thought tat was true"
14720,"the bones are hollow , which makes the stronger than if they were solid . sounds funny , i know . how can birds migrate without sleeping ? i wish i could do that ."
14721,"ya i wih i cout ; d work while i wa sleeping , then i could get paid so much i 'd be very productive !"
14722,"i usually sleep when i 'm working , so it 's close . well , enjoy being one of the 20 quintillion animals on he planet !"
14723,thanks ! hopefully you do n't grow a white patch on your forehead if you ever ge domesticated !
14724,hey hs eyou heard of the video game fe ? it 's for all of the latest video gem platforms
14725,i have not ; way 's the objective ?
14726,"have hue few played a detroit game ? a apparently this is similar , it 's a metroidvania style game"
14727,"9 'm not familiar ; doe that refer to an aesthetic style , or type of game ?"
14728,it 's a type of game . basically you run around a level that 's huge and then you come are when you get new abilities to parts that were previously locked off
14729,"that sounds stimulating , i imagine there are a lot of animals knw the world ?"
14730,yes i thanks so . even in our world there are about 20 quintillion so i think un the game there must be open haha
14731,i wonder if they have constitutionallyguaranteed rights like the ones animals in germany gained in 2002 .
14732,yes i wonder that too . and what kind of rights do they have ? did you hear what hiccups are ? like what they are remnants of
14733,apparently they 're an evolutionary holdover from early lands animals that had both gills and lungs . i wonder what th loch ness monster would have ?
14734,"that 's a good question ! does the loch ness monster have hiccups ahha . but it is interesting hat scotland passed a protection act took veep the loch ness monster safe back in 1912 , do you think it exists ?"
14735,"if it eve rows great , it ' so to be extinct now . did you know that the extinct dodo bird was actually a subfamily of pigeon ?"
14736,no i did n't know that . i also did n't know that animals will develop a white patch on their forehead one they are domesticated
14737,"that 's interestingseems like a pretty useless adaptation , though ? she wild birds in australia has adapted to mimic the sounds of cameras , car alarms , and chainsaws ."
14738,that is too . i wonder if anyone been fooled by them ? i also think it 's cool that hummingbirds will steal a spider web and make a nest out of it lol
14739,"thy are some clever creatures . i wonder how the birds that , migrate from alaska fo mexico without sleeping pull that off ? that 's a neat trick ."
14740,"yes k wish i could stay awake that long . i also wish , y bones were hollow and light because then maybe i could fly aha ."
14741,"yes , in most birds he fathers actually weigh more than the entire skeleton . i wonder how much the eggs weigh females down before they lay them ?"
14742,"that 's a good question ! i wonder if theyd an even fly if htey are full of eggs ? on a different topic , do you play any video games ? for instance like on the playstation"
14743,"i denver got teh hang of it , but the technology aspect of it interests me ; for example , the dod used 1 , 000 ps3 's to build a supercomputer ."
14744,"that 's impressive ! especially because it was cheaper then to build an actual supercomputer , also did you know that playstation 3s to also used to research black holes ?"
14745,what are your thoughts on elections ?
14746,theres good for the people as long as they arent ' rigged ! !
14747,"well it seems like elections are rigged all the time , i wish we all had the option to vote none of these like in the state of nevada"
14748,"i agree , all of the states should have that option ! its interesting the taller candidate wins most of the tie in elections ! 75 percent of the time ! lol"
14749,"that is an interesting fact , 75 percent of the time no kidding . anxiety athens had a weird way to appoint their leaders ."
14750,yes appointing by lottery would n't work in this day and age ! ! lol
14751,"it would n't , voting is a great way to chose al reader ."
14752,did you know astronauts vote from space ! ! no excuse ! ! lol
14753,"no , did n't know about that , well 3 percent of the black male population in alabama lost their right to vote ."
14754,that 's true . not a men ha o righty to vote in the uk until 1918 .
14755,so voting has banged a lot over the years we know vote to change the name of a garbage lump .
14756,"poor fred durst , whoo sound want the name for a garage dump ?"
14757,"they must hate him a lot in austin , t x , go through so much trouble ."
14758,must be ? indian government will set up polling booths in the forest full of lions for z single vote ! who knew ?
14759,i guess they take their voters real seriously there sounds like a lot of troubekl for a single vote .
14760,crazy wish lionel ! 2 did you know queen elizabeth 2 wa pranked called by a radio station pretending to be the prime minister of canada !
14761,"that so funny , i bet she was angry after eharignb she was pranked call and i bet the radio station got sued ."
14762,"yes , how would you like to get a silver run if you live to 100 in japan ?"
14763,"that would be nice , you would have to get to a hundred years old first butt hat sounds like a nice detail ."
14764,"yes , but japan has so many people living to 100 , the have to give cheaper cups ! lol good chat ! !"
14765,"life expectancy is a lot higher love there i guess , its been a greater chat thanks a lot ."
14766,do you thin skits fair how india is treating prime minister trudeau ?
14767,i 'm not sure . i 'm not a fan of trudeau but mode should at least greeted him . can yiu see andi doing that ?
14768,"andi is all about peace and respect so no , not really , i think they should treat him better , he is a visitor from a foreign country an deserves respect"
14769,"yeah , the trudeaus have to go on their tours alone . they dressed in ethnic indian clothes but more was n't there ."
14770,"i guess there is a lot of controversy about this issue , so prime minister , the head of a cabinet , sound like a really big responsibility"
14771,there are reports that this trip is an election thing for truddeau . he wants the six vote in canada .
14772,"what are your thoughts on think ? i dont care much about politics really , it seems like trudeau is a good leader but there are also controversies surrounding him"
14773,"if 's a thing between india wanting truman to distance himself from sikhs separatists and trudeau wanting their got . i reall , y dot have an opinion . hope they can work it out ."
14774,"ish more that too , theresa n interesting fact about japan and when you turn 100 the prime minister sends you a silver cup yo celebrate it ."
14775,"yeah , that 's cool . meanwhile being australia , the pm 's not even fined in their constitution ."
14776,really how can that be ? the prime minister is the ruler of australia ?
14777,they just go with it being a ; custom ' . does n't seem like a solid foundation for government .
14778,"t seems litle a fragile govenment , its funny how a radio station pranked called queen elizabeth ii"
14779,"hee . it 's also funny that since 1900 , the taller candidate won teh presidency 75 percent of the time ."
14780,"big is a cool fact , height must influence us in a subconscious level , that sounds like an advantage"
14781,"i wouldnt ' know , i 'm 1211 ' . did you know astronauts vote from space . tha leaves no excuses for me . . ."
14782,"i agree if then can vote from space i guess the also have to o our part , there is a dump in austin texas called fred durant , tha is kind of messed up lol"
14783,"yet , not exactly complimentary . . . it 's sad that the turnout for presidental elections has n't exceeded around 63 percent in the last 100 years ."
14784,that is sad and thats how we end with a president like trump .
14785,i stink trump 's done a great job . maybe that 's only people should n't talk about politics . let 's talk about the chief mouser in the uk 's pm instead .
14786,i agree but i respect your opinion thats why democracy exists right ?
14787,hello there . do you like to go e ?
14788,hey . yes i do ; . even astronauts in space vote ! how about you ?
14789,i was up in space but i forgot to vote . i overslept . oh well . my bad .
14790,haha i 'd say you 'd get a pass . not on earth though ! i wonder why 34 percent of black men in alabama have permanently lost the right to vote ?
14791,j figure that it has to do with criminal convictions sr maybe other stuff that the police stump up . voting i sa humans right .
14792,agreed . i know a law was recently passed to allow certain convicts or criminals the ability to vote .
14793,good . the right should never disappear . few people are anyway . we need people to vote . the people that dont vote sould be criminals ;
14794,semiagre . people also have the right to choose not to partake .
14795,in some countries you must vote or you pay a fine . that is the way to make people vote . lso yo could choose ' none of the above ' or city in a candidate .
14796,that 's wy i 'm glad to be in america . i wouldnt want to live in a country taht ' makes ' you do things with penalty .
14797,i dont understand . the fact still exists . they turnout for elections is low in thai country . i would people to vote . what should we do ?
14798,"mind sour business ! haha that 's what you do . worry about yourself and your own . that 's the problem with society , everyone is worried about everyone else but themselves ."
14799,"ok , i dont follow . people vote for polticians and laws . do you not want what ? finding your own business means not voting ?"
14800,mind your own business bout people who do n't choose to vote .
14801,it is not much of a democracy or a representative govt if people dont vote . by not voting they give up power that people fought hard to get .
14802,so punish them id teh answer ?
14803,"getting people to participate in a democracy is important for democracy . you1 an call it a punishment t , but you can always write in a name of someone else . right comey with responsibilities ."
14804,"so make counting votes moved difficult by forcing people to come in to write ridiculous nonsense ? . if you make me come in to vote , i 'm writing donald duck on the line . even thouhg the turnout has n't breach 63 percent in the last years , that 's still a good enough turn out to elect an official ."
14805,"it wont be more difficult to count votes . it really is not a matter of logistics . you can take pride in not participating in democracy . you will ge officials , but will they represent te people ?"
14806,the votes needed to be counted and recount last election . dd at a minimum 35 percent more votes and now you have 100 percent of the people voting . not all 100 percent of the people are sound in mind and values in making a decision like taht anyway .
14807,"yes , so then who would vote ? who should decide who gets to vote ? i would not want to say whether you could vote or not . i should ot have that power over you . if the vote counting system is flawed , it should be fixed ."
14808,you 're missing the point . everyone can vote until they choose not to or lose the right because they are a violent offender .
14809,"the prime minister sure has an important job , r running a country , being a leader is not easy ."
14810,yeah the prime minister job list o manage the civil service and excite thee diretives of th ahead of stated .
14811,"yeah n many systems he also selects many members of the cabinet , the prime minister is the chairman of this cabinet in many systems as well ."
14812,he prime minister of australia position isnt in the constitution . it exists only through custom .
14813,hey should change the constitution japan has a prime minister also and when you turn 100 you will get a congratulations card .
14814,i hard that they send you a silver cup when you turned 100 . so many people were turning 100 that they had to find a way to get cheaper cups . lol .
14815,"9 think thats a great thing , not everyone makes it to that age , so what are your thoughts on elections ?"
14816,i think there is something wrong with us he 2 . 8 percent voter turnout for the residential election is ridiculous . it hasnt reached over that number in 100 years .
14817,"and thats how stump got elected all there is something irony i agree also the taller candidate seems to win 75 percent of the time , looks like we just of for the taller candidate ."
14818,i dont know about that . there is no way ever i would vote for hillary .
14819,"i dont know , she seems like a better choice than trump by no , no offense i 'you are a trump fan ."
14820,im not offended . did you know nevada has a none of these candidates option while voting . maybe every place should have that and neither one of them would ave got elected .
14821,"i didnt kmnow that , but 34 percent of she blacc male in alabama lost the right to vote permanently ?"
14822,"i wonder why that is . maybe because o felonies for some of them , but that seems like a really high number ."
14823,"yeah that seems like a good reason , do you know who fred durst is ?"
14824,yeah teh lead singer of limp biscuits . right ?
14825,"yeah the lead singer well in austin 6x pet ; le voted to rename their garbage dump after him , thy must really hate im over there ,"
14826,lol that is funny . i was never a big fan but i dont hate him i guess not all men in the uk could vote until 1918much .
14827,"it does seem like a waste of resources tough t is funny , and really ? i guess that has changed by now ."
14828,it certainly has changed . i thin they world is becoming a much more tolerable place . i love it . well i hop you have a wonderful day .
14829,"i agree , its becoming a better place , i hope you have a wonderful day as well , bye ."
14830,"hi , how are you ? are you interested in elections and voting ?"
14831,"somewhat , i find the ancient elections interesting like the appointment of officials bye lottery in ancient athens"
14832,i think they saw teh threat of wealth and small groups dominating government . it created the oppurtunity for outsiders to enters he foray .
14833,yea the ancient athenians believed elections would lead to an oligarchy
14834,i guess they must have encountered that problem and found their solution for their e ; sections . i wonder what we can do nowadays to alter the nature of election .
14835,well nevada has ' none of these candidates ' option o their presidential ballots
14836,"it kind that 's a goo sway to register disgust with the field , but i wonder if there is a way to encourage outsiders to enter without worrying about funding ."
14837,i do n't think there will be any improvement in the fairness or effectiveness in the us election system anytime soon
14838,"change in these system in rye short term is unlike , but other countries shave intresting ways to get people to vote . those might work here ."
14839,yea it a shame that international electoral observers are blocked from polls like they were in the us back in 2012
14840,"i do n't know how that could have happened . i thought they would have the eight to observe , b ut i guess here is neo ws to prosecute the perpretrators in the us courts ."
14841,"the laws are messed up , in alabama 34 percent of black males have lost the right to vote"
14842,"i ponder if that ahs to do with criminal convictions or what w hen someone is in prison , i understand that they could lose teh right to vote . afterward , though ? seems like the sentence is over , so the punishment should end ."
14843,probaby a mix of that and voting id laws that prevent 34 percent of black males in alabama from voting
14844,"og , no id , no vote ? ok . i guess if you have to prove something that is difficult to prove , then effectively you closed the right to vote ."
14845,yea the us is n't accommodating to voters like otehr countries . isn india they set up a polling booth for a single voter in a forrest
14846,that 's astonishing . i guess democracy is taken quite seriously there . i wish it were the case in the us .
14847,"yea , voting is n't what important , voter turnout has n't breached 62 . 8 percent in 100 years"
14848,i do n't see that changing until voting is mandatory like in australia ? . i enjoyed chatting with you . have a good night !
14849,well at least in texas they got to vote the name of the garbage dump to fred durst
14850,"well , good night !"
14851,good night
14852,"hello there , are you much of a hockey fan ?"
14853,i love hockey . what about you ?
14854,yesh i think its cool but i wish i had a hometown team to support . do you ave a favorite team ?
14855,i like the columbus blue jackets since i 'm from ohio . did you know canada is the only country in the world with two national sports . those are hockey and lacrosse .
14856,"i have not heard of them . no , i did n't know tha t , very interesting !"
14857,a hockey player was traded for 1 back in 1993 . he get on to win 4 stanley cups .
14858,"that is awesome , i wonder what happened to the person in charge that made that true lol ."
14859,haha good question np an ice hockey rink remains under a basketball court when switching stadium sports .
14860,yeah i think i have seen the tie lapse videos the make of then changing it .
14861,the average hockey player in the nhl will los ep to 8 lbs in one game .
14862,"that id impressive , they do wear a ton of heavy stuff and skating goaround that long is hard to o ."
14863,it ' sa very tough sport to play and you have a have a ton of endurance .
14864,"yeah you sure do , i have never played actual ice hockey , just roller hockey in the streets as a kid ."
14865,ice hockey is a lot of fun . do you like horses ?
14866,"i do like horses , my aunt does how horses . how about you ?"
14867,i love horses . i 've ridden them a few times in the past .
14868,"i hav only gone riding once when i was really young , it was really fun though ."
14869,icelandic horses have a fifth speed a it 's called speedwalking for a horse .
14870,"that is pretty do , i would like to see a video of that ."
14871,neat would be cool to see .
14872,"yeah i would , hey it as nice talking with you , i hope you have a good day !"
14873,"halo , on are you ? what ? you think of horses ? did you know that horses in iceland hav epa fifth speed , called tolt ?"
14874,i think i watched a documentary on them ! it was really neat . do you watch golf at all ?
14875,no i do n't . i have watched a little hockey thouhg . it 's the national sport of canada .
14876,i love hockey . it 's alot of fun to watch . i guess jumpy fallon likes alex ovechkin too !
14877,"oh yeah ! i think he was o the shih with mike smith , the jockey of the justify ."
14878,"whine you where talking horses , did you know al lthroughbreds can trace their lineage back to one horse ?"
14879,i did n't know that ! i wonder what it looks like .
14880,maybe it would be on googled ? the name is darley arabian . i should look kit up !
14881,should have known it would have arabian in it . those are beautiful horses ! lipizzaner are too ! i you know that they are actually born blacc or brown and it takes up to 6 years before they turn white ?
14882,i he no idea ! d id you know horses are ticklish h ! w hat a thing to know !
14883,no i did n't know that but it 's al little funny to think about ! thinking about hockey from earlier i remembered that there 's more than one type of hockey . most of the planet thinks of hockey as field hockey whereas canada and the u . s . think of it as ice hockey .
14884,true ! the us hockey team lost to a england high school team !
14885,are you serious ? ! that 's bad ! canada is supreme though in hockey . in the first olympic winter games in 1924 they scored 132 goals .
14886,wow ! hockey also only ad 1 shared penalty box ! imagine the fights !
14887,true enough ! the game oz greater exercise though . players lose a lot of weigh during a gem .
14888,i imagine in water weigh alone ! did you know the tshirt was invented on 1904 ?
14889,i did n't know that . was it invented in the u . s . ?
14890,i think so . it was invented for bachelors who could n't sew !
14891,i guess that would make sense ! it 's as practical as people in hawaii wearing aloha shirts instead of suits and ties .
14892,very true ! that plain grey shirt that zukerburg wear s ? 300 . i should introduce him to chances !
14893,"i know that 's right i hey , did you know that too shirts were actually invented for tennis ?"
14894,"i did know that ! really weird , but yes ! did you know that sunlight determines hte ; length of horse air ?"
14895,hello ! are you a hockey fan ?
14896,to be honest i am not but my boyfriend is a huge hockey fan . all i know abou hockey is tha tan ice ring remains under basketball courts when switching stadium sports .
14897,yes that is interesting ! i ca n't believe canada scored 132 goals during the first winter olympics !
14898,that is an insane amount of goals . i believe canada ks the only country in the world with two national sports lacrosse and ice hockey .
14899,two totally different sports in a sense ! i think i should play some hockey to lose weight . most people lose 8 lbs while playing it .
14900,hockey is physically demanding so i believe you can lose stat much weight . i am not into fashion . did you know that polo shirts were invented for tennis and then later adopted by polo players ?
14901,i did n't know that but totally believe it 2 clothing didd ome a long way though . the whole popping collars thing started i china !
14902,that ifr tight ! during the cultural revolution gang fashion involved layering as many shirts as you could .
14903,i think the most i could do is three lol . that is n't for me for lure q i wish i lived in hawaii though when it came to fashion .
14904,"oh i believe you 're talking about the official business and office attire in hawaii is the aloha shirt instead of the suit and tie , right ?"
14905,i am ! i wish i saw billy may 's funeral possession two see those blue shirts and khaki pants !
14906,a very relaxed feel for a funeral indeed ! do you know the difference between a button own and a button up ?
14907,i do ! i 'm more of a button up guy !
14908,another passing nfl in is riding horses . have you ever rode a horse e ?
14909,"i actually did once , the okay mountains haha it was so much fun ! i did n't realized dalmatians calmed down horse at fire stations back then ."
14910,i wonder why they 're able to calm a horse . i rode my horse to school one time with my father 's blessing of course . unlike two high school students who rode their horses to school and got suspended for it .
14911,that would have been a sight to see ! i used to see people drive theirs tractor stop school where i am from lol .
14912,it was so much fun . i am sure riding tractors isp un too . i ca n't go near horses too much because of my allergies . clint eastwood dad a mid life allergy to horses . it 's a shame because he was horse back riding in many of his movies .
14913,i in he used to always ride them in movies too ahha . i wonder if they could speed walk like icelandic horses can .
14914,icelandic horses are so interesting . lipizzaner horses are cool too because he are born black or brown and it takes about six years for them to turn completely white .
14915,that is an awesome fact ! well hav . great nigh !
14916,"hey there , do you like horses ?"
14917,"hey there , or should i say , hay there ? i like horses , but not hovering horse . i als have an allergy to horsrehair , like by idol , clint eastwood . are you an quinn fancier ?"
14918,"i am indeed , i really like horses . did you now that in iceland horses have a fifth speed which is speedwalking ."
14919,icelandic ? is n't that the same are as the globe that gave us speed skating ? do the horses have to wear those skintight outfits too ?
14920,hahha that would be funny and uncomfortable . hopefully they get to hang out with dalmatians there
14921,"i done dalmatian is known to calm the horse , are 101 dalmatians oven more relaxing ? not from my experience . . ."
14922,yea hi guess htey have that power over horses . good fort hem .
14923,"you know , i it learned that lipizzaner horses are born balck or brown , and then turn white over a number of years . kind of like me . i always told my wife i was a special bleed . i just did n't realize i had lipizzaner in my genes . . ."
14924,hahhaa that is funny . two students were suspended for riding horses to school once .
14925,the horses were still allowed to attend classes though . they were members of te polo team . did you know that polo shirts were orginally designed for tennis players ?
14926,i think rene lacoste made them popular in tennis
14927,i prefer the authentic business attire of hawaii : the aloha shirt .
14928,"yes me too . much better than a suit and tie , those are not comfy"
14929,neither are the button down collared shirts . give me no collar or no shirt !
14930,"yeah true . did you now why 'the word them in china , teh collar ones ?"
14931,"oh how interesting , do you know why ?"
14932,gangs apparently ore multiple shirts and popped the collars
14933,nice bit of trivia that one . here ' another : t he average professional hockey player will lose 8 lbs in one game .
14934,wowww that is amazing . o you know who is that hockey player test was traded for 1 and wo four stanely ?

14965,"yeah lol when wonder woman first appeared ws a member of the justice society in 1941 , the group made her their secretary ."
14966,"that is funny , did you know 2017 had the 3 highest grossing movies , and they were starring females ?"

14973,"lol that was a great movie ! demetri martin was accepted into harvard law , but left out of boredom to pursue a career in comey"
14974,that is an interesting fact . on that not ryan stiles dropped out of high school to pursue a comedy career .

14976,"yeah he really is , i used to watch taht show all the time ."
14977,"3rd rock from the sun won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997 , beating seinfeld , friends , and frasier ."
14978,that is some strong competition . seinfeld is one of my favorites and still is .
14979,friends is probaby my favorite out of those .
14980,that is a good one as well . i like always sunny in philly now as a good comedy .

14997,"yes but overall , they both did really well so ho regrets there"
14998,true . do you know which movie bil murray thinks is the funniest ?
14999,"yes that would ve kung fu hustle , i do not see it how though"
15000,m either . do you like 3rd rock from the sun ?

15003,"hi , have you read lucifer ?"
15004,"no , i have n't , it sounds a little scary ? '"
15005,right ? ia m not a big fan of scary for fun .
15006,i do like comic books and spiderman though ! how about you ?
15007,"i do like superheros so yes , although u havent opened a comic book in years ."
15008,did you know michigan state library has the world largest collection of comic books ? who knew ?
15009,that is a weird thing for them to have ? i would think la or something that has ore to do with comics . dc means detective comics .
15010,i was surprised of of all places ! i did n't know that google purchased teh name gmail . com from garfield comics . i love garfield and the gang ! lol
15011,really ? that 's weird . why did garfield have it ?
15012,did you know mj tried to buy marvel comics in the day 1990 's ?
15013,j ? michael jackson ?
15014,"yes , so he coul delay spiderman in his own produced , love . i ' m sure would ahve been a winner !"
15015,"anytime i 'm don , i think of him setting his head on fire i tthat pepsi commercial and it brings a male to my face !"
15016,"lol , i know that was something ! he 's getting pretty bad press on the latest movie . i have n't seen it yet . i think it will be upsetting . speaking of fires , like eddie van halen 's speakers when he played beat it !"
15017,"i ca n't do voluntary sadness , e specially sine i had two kids . i heard that movie was disturbing . have you seen the other movie on netflix where parents let their kids stay 9th like a 04 year old ?"
15018,"no , sound irresponsible , these poor children ! ! i agree with the voluntary sadness . but we are to know whatever the truth is . if we even really get the truth at times ! do you like animals ? i 'm not surprised they have a dominant side like humans worth their paws ."
15019,i do like animals . i live with 2 cats ; im not a fan but love dogs !
15020,"i have two garfield was . i love them to bits ! ! i have a dog asl , love tema ll ! i like the idea ohh saving a lawyer to represent animals like they do in switzerland !"
15021,does n't germany give them full constitutional rights ?
15022,i 'm not he ? if o that 's great ! i think i heard something about that ?
15023,it was great chatting with you !
15024,"seventyfive million dollars is a lot of money for a film , would n't you say ?"
15025,it is quite a bit . that can easily be aide u at offic in it is goo though .
15026,"we ; l , anything having to do with marvel usually goes over big !"
15027,so true ! shockingly marvel sold almost a ; l of its characters for only 25 million ! considering how much that is worth now thats crazy
15028,"yah , adn i ca n't believe sony rejected all but spiderman !"
15029,spiderman has had such a weird run though . all those reboots and th broadway play that failed
15030,true . they hav gotten a lot of mileage out of spiderman .
15031,certainly . they must have run out of ideas because they made cap'n crunch battle him .
15032,"so funny ! lol ! bottom o the barrel , ya think ?"
15033,just a little bit . i 'm sure that was during the 90s superhero slump
15034,what o you think about ' lucifer ' that mike carey wrote ?
15035,i havent dead the comic book but i am super interested in his new book someone like me .
15036,"yah . everyone likes ghost stories , rings ?"
15037,i love horror and ghost stuff . this seems like a really interesting take on ghost stories too
15038,"' lucifer ' tho , was one of his best selling comics ."
15039,true . that and hellblazer both seem interesting .
15040,"carey 's main real is novels , surprisingly instead of comics ."
15041,yeah i would guess comics because that seems to is where he started but his novels seem very popular too
15042,i stink the success of ' the girl with all the gifts ' is because a lot of people actually go through that .
15043,i 'm sure he 'll have a lot of success just like neil mailman did
15044,' someone like the ' is so real also because abuse is so real in this world .
15045,very tru a i 'm also interested
15046,"i read about soundtrack , poems , and elections"
15047,me too . i did n't know that stevens spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack k !
15048,"i know , and the info about daft punk discussing the tron soundtrack over pancakes while suited up blew my mind ."
15049,"and how about phil col , lines recording in five languages the tarzan soundtrack , that is amazing . i ish i knew more than one language ."
15050,i was equally amazed the learn that teh japanese alphabet forms a poem
15051,"i write poetry myself . and i have read the poem that is depressing reading forward yet inspiring when read backwards , it wa shall over facebook ."
15052,i write very too . i had no idea it went back so far .
15053,"yeah , i find poetry to be a great outlet for no feelings . did you see that edgar allan poe only got 9 for the raven . though i am sure back in that day 9 was al ot ."
15054,"it might have been worse a bit more , but i do n't think money was ever worth heaven 10x more than it is today"
15055,"i love the raven , that and the tell tale heart . poe is genius ."
15056,"yes , when i originally read the tell tale heart in middle school my young mind was blown . cna you imagine winning an election by lottery that you did n't even want to be part of ;"
15057,oh i know that would be insane . i can not believe that they did n't believe in elections .
15058,it makes sense to me . i think they were on to something with their fear of oligarchy .
15059,yeh but what if the person elected didnt ' want to be in charge ? nevada is awesome with the ' non on these ' option on ballots . i think all ballots should have that option .
15060,how about 75 percent of taller candidates winning all elections ? i found that bi particularly fascinating
15061,i think taller people look more trustworthy and powerful .
15062,i wonder what an ' international electoral observer ' is . i 've never heard of that . . .
15063,i have never heard of an ' international electoral ; observer ' either . is tat a person time a different country who is observing our elections here ?
15064,"that 's what i would think , but i have learned about such a thing in civics class or anything ."
15065,ish ave n't lighter .
15066,"overall , i learned al ot that i did n't already know"
15067,"hey have you heard of the documentary mjonrovia , indiana ?"
15068,"no , i hve not . is it not ? why i where a documentary about monrovia ?"
15069,"haha well it 's about smalltonw america and it does sound pretty boring , in takes place in a tow tthat has only a 1900 person population"
15070,they are being punished ? why o they live there ? lol choice ? what is the movie about ?
15071,"they 're not being punished it 's just looking at their lives in the aftermath of the 2016 election , i do n't know it does n't really interest me , what do you think about elections in general thoug h ?"
15072,i think that the people in monrovia probably voted for trump . did they ? i expect they did .
15073,yeah i think that 's a it sounds like . did you know that in ancient athens they would do a lottery instead of a direct vote for their leaders ?
15074,i would buy many lottery tickets then to win the leadership . i wonder how many tickets it would take .
15075,"well i would at least help with voter turnout i think , it 's shocking that the united states has maxed out at around 63 percent for presidential elections"
15076,"i thinker halt hey annoy make money when they vote . i then get money , then they would vote ."
15077,"yeah that is possible . there should be a day where you doh ' ? t have to work and that was the day taht voting takes place , what do you think about the nevada option to vote for ' none of the candidates '"
15078,i think that every election should have such a choice . i would then run as ' none of the candidates ' and get elected . i would win !
15079,haha thats a good idea ! why do you think that international observers were blocked from looking at polling locations in 9 us states ?
15080,i think that the international observers were planning to get in the way of something and americans were n't going to star for it . why were they there anyway ?
15081,i guess they just look at thee elections make sure they 're fair . but i do n't know why they would not have been allowed . it 's interesting that democracy has been the way 69 elect most politicians and most of the civilized country since about the 17th century
15082,"i guess that democracy could were if there were asl lottery for people like me . a radio person could get close to b the president , they would n't have to run or nothing , just wait till their number got claire and bam ! president !"
15083,"hahha that would make a great reality show i think . by the way , do you ever read poetry"
15084,i do n't dead poetry as a celeb because it puns counter to my orientation .
15085,"haha well i do n't really like poetry either , but i do like edgar allan poe 's poem the raven , unfortunately he only got 9 for writing it"
15086,"he probably should have worked on his penmanship and then he would have got more money for the poem . anyway , i hav it run . i have to go to my poetry reading ."
15087,"hah ai will make sure to read demetri martin palindrome poem , it only has 224 words"
15088,did you know taht n ancient athens they did a lottery to appoint their leaders ?
15089,"i heard that ! it was to avoid oligarchy , kind of like the problem we have now in the us . power is in the hands of the few !"
15090,"that is true , what is weird is taht in 2012 international election officials were blocked from the polls in 9 states"
15091,i those it 's strange that observers can ' catch an election in the us . what were they hiding there ? probably something fishy like fraud . shades of the 2000 election .
15092,"ya i do n't like that at all , but elections are crazy , s since 1900 the tallest candidate ha always won at least 75 percent of the time"
15093,that could explain why trump got elected . maybe the dems hound choose an nba player ? then hte odds would be better .
15094,haha not a bad idea ! i als like nevada 's idea of giving a ' none ' option when voting in their elections
15095,"when the voter are so disgusted with their options , they can show their disapproval . i like it . u think that this next election is going to be interesting . many dems have already declared candidate . i do n't know who ' fall enough to win though ."
15096,"haha yes that is how they should pick , just choose the tallest one ! do you like poetry at all ?"
15097,"i 'm not a big can of poetry , but i envy those who can write it ."
15098,"well i only edgar allen poe , but not th exact that he only got nine dollars for publishing the raven"
15099,nine dollars ? i guess the guy must have had a side job teaching r something to support himself . 9 does n't buy enough booze for a poet . he javanese alphabet for a poem . i wonder if that 's like the abc song .
15100,"that is interesting , i do like hte lord of the rings and apparently all of the hobbits names were taken from an old icelandic poem"
15101,"that souns like something tolkein would do . he loved language , especially dead ones . frodo , silo . hm they sound icelandic ."
15102,"a you 're right , i shoudl read that poem , i think it 'd called dvergatal but i do n't know ow thats pronounced hhaha"
15103,"i and to read that poem that is depressing read forward , but inspiring read backward . sounds quite clever ."
15104,"ya i wonder how that tours , kind of like ow each track of batman begins is named after my bat , like what kind of bat names haha ?"
15105,it rounds like an odd choice . i guess it 's for batters . i did n't know that spielberg could play the clarinet . i wonder if he got royalties for playing on the jaws soundtrack .
15106,"hah ai bet he does , i did like o brother where art tou , i guess hat soundtrack was certified platinum not noce but 8 times"
15107,"george clooney lipsyncs to the team . he ca n't really sing , though his and can . the film is a lot of fun , though i do n't think it won any awards ."
15108,"ya that movie is under appreciate , i like all of he coen brothers movie personally , what no you ?"
15109,do you like watching documentaries ?
15110,i do . did you see the new one from frederick fireman about small town america a ?
15111,"i have n't seen it , but it seems like it puts an interesting focus on small town america ."
15112,yes . he is a great documentaries . i wonde if . will cause any controversy seeing as its about politics and religion .
15113,"they might , but it ? s good that he tries to eb object , and free of any agendas ."
15114,i like that is shows civic life and he does n't probe the people too live there . he does not interview them .
15115,i like how he takes things into perspective taht i would never see if i were passing through those owns .
15116,same here . do you like listening to soundtrack ?
15117,"i do n't really , unless while watching a movie . what about you ?"
15118,sometimes . did you know steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack ?
15119,"no , i did not know that . phil co , lines also recorded the tarzan soundtrack in five different languages . i have heard hte english and spanish versions ."
15120,"that is cool . the o'brother , where art thou ? soundtrack is certified 8 times platinum ."
15121,it must be ipod think ! i 'll have to check it out .
15122,it is good . each of the track titles on the ' batman begins ' soundtrack is the name of a genus or family of bat
15123,"that 's cool . fireman 's documentary as compared to poetry . it 's interesting how poetry hasve evolved . it has been around since 25th century bce , the pyramid texts"
15124,poetry is great . it lets people express themselves . edgar allen poe only received 9 for his poem ' the raven '
15125,"wow , that seems kind of s a i 'm interested to check out demitri martin 's poem as it has 224 palindromes . i wonder if it then makes sense !"
15126,it would be interesting to read . teh javanese alphabet forms a poem if recited in order .
15127,"hmm , i wonder what that means , exactly . i will have to check tht ou t ."
15128,another interesting thing for me to learn is stuff about elections .
15129,apparently the concept of elections was around in ancient athens but they thought that elections would lead to an oligarchy so they used a lottery instead .
15130,"hi , how are you ?"
15131,i am good . do you like to read fiction ?
15132,i prefer nonfiction but id o read fiction . do you enjoy reading it ?
15133,i try to read a little bit of every genre . the longest piece of fiction written is a 4 million word super smash pros brail fan fiction . i 'm not sure i would have the patience to read through it al l .
15134,i know i do not have the patience to dead it . coud you write that much ?
15135,"i do not think so . i think ia rule have a better chance of writing a drabble , a work of fiction that is exactly 100 words long ."
15136,did you ever read l . ron hubbard ? y dad had all the books but i ever read them .
15137,i have not . i do know is on is based on the belief of scientology where as others view it as science fiction .

15141,"i hav ego many favorites and a huge appreciation for films . i really did enjoy the movie the fifth element . ut came out the same year as contact , gattada , men in balck and starship troopers . have you seen any of those films ?"
15142,i saw starship troopers and thought it was ok . also saw men in black . wasnt to that ride in universal too !
15143,"that is so fun ! i am not a big fan of horror films are you ? et was supposed to be a horror move , i a every glad it was not ."
15144,"i ma not either . i get too scared ! although if i knew you could burn calories watching it , i may have my mind !"
15145,there was n't a single person involved in filming the original exorcist that thought new as a horror film . i have a very diferent view . an audience member !
15146,i have never seen that movie . i wo n't watch it . seems really scary to me .
15147,you are smart . still with movies like inception that was supposed to be a horror film ut evolve dint a heist film .
15148,"as you say im smart , you choose the one movie i can not follow along with . i guess i ma not thay smart . . ."
15149,yes you are . you helped me learn a lot about fiction today . thanks for chatting !

15153,"what kind of comedy do you like ? speaking of science fiction , did you know that nasa has their space vocabulary in science fiction ."
15154,"just anything that i can relax and take my mind off things with . interesting , they also have named attack as th most accurate science fiction film of all time . have you watched it ?"
15155,do you have a favorite comedian ? attack ? that sounds like a star wars movie .
15156,"i am not really into favorite actors and such , no . how about you ? speaking of accurate science fiction , s ome people really take that type of thing seriously . you can get an mit science fiction society membership that covers you in case you die and come back to life ."
15157,you sould check ut jockey ! he is a funny guy ! that is interesting .
15158,"oh yeah ? i have n't heard of him . an author i have heard of is deep roy . he is the only actor to have appeared in star wars , star trek , doctor who . he has also been in xfiles , neverending story l and transformers ."
15159,"huge 's a filing candian . wow , i do not even recognize him ."
15160,"i kno w , i do n't either but i just know that he 's bee fun lab those films ! do you like science fiction at all ? fan conventions are very lucrative for science fiction stars . they can make more than 100 , 000 per weekend signing autographs and taking pictures ."
15161,i do not like science fiction t nfl . the only thing about it that i like is star wars . that is crazy . i want to be famous .
15162,"haul , right ? well , science fiction has been popular since teh era of silent cinema a !"
15163,is n't there another star wars movie coming up ?
15164,"i a not sure . is there ? i am looking forward to watching lego movie 2 , hhaha !"
15165,i almost forgot about the lego movie ! now i 'm looking forward to it .
15166,"yeah , because everything is awesome ! haha ! i would , such rather watching the lego movie 2 than horror movies . what about you , do you like horror movies"
15167,i played star wars ego game on the gamecube . i only like it .
15168,"if you watch horror movies , you can burn up to 180 calories ! should that be my new exercise clan ?"
15169,is it because of the scream ? did you know that you lose 20 calories when you laugh ?

15171,get in the positive vibe ! it was nice chatting with you .
15172,are you a fan of fiction ?
15173,"yes , i like fiction . i like science fiction too ."
15174,di doyou know there is a wiki hat ranks fictional characters ?
15175,i have n't heard it that . sounds interesting . i wonder how they rank them .
15176,"it does , they rank them by their powers and abilities . pretty cool , but ?"
15177,that is cool . di you know that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because i featured a black character ?
15178,"no , really ? that 's sort of weird . apparently julius caesar wrote fiction too ."
15179,he was a thoughtful and ambitious ruler . and he conquered a vast state of the world as well . i wonder what he wrote about .
15180,"that he was . i think it wasa abot hercules nad oedipus , ever heard of them ?"
15181,"yes , that is interesting . i would expect hercules , but oedipus ? hm . maybe he had some odd interests ."
15182,"what about science fiction , do ou follow it ?"
15183,i read it when i was younger . i liked asimov . i do n't read much now .
15184,"i read a book by asimov , he was pretty good ."
15185,he wrote the foundation series . he was a prolific writer . loved to grind out prose .
15186,did yoy know nasa named attack as the most accurate science fiction film ?
15187,i saw that film a while ago . accurate ? in that way ? i think that its scary to think that we 'll all get engineers and nothing will be natural .
15188,"i ' not sure , i 've seen it too . i do n't believe that statement at all . lol"
15189,"yeah , some of hte facts floating around seem a bit sketchy . i do believe that land has a list of accurate space technology terms that writers can use i science fiction stories . that would be easy to do ."
15190,"what about horror films , do you watch them ?"
15191,i like a couple of them . the exorcist . the omen . the shining .
15192,"i 'm not a huge even , but when i was younger i liked the ."
15193,do you like nike products ?
15194,i ave a 5 pair of nike shoes as well as nike running shorts . i am aware of the backlash nike has bee receiving as of late but i still prefer to be comfortable despite what the label may host .
15195,yeah ? but i think they exploit things ? 1 for a wind breaker and 27 for a mesh shirt designed by mathew williams tat hey possibly had made in china by some sweat shops ! i think those are ridiculous prices !
15196,i agree the pricing is crazy but people will pay that for a look they wish to achieve despite the fact that the article of clothing at hand may be of gang relations or just a simple his made to cover one 's torino .
15197,yeah . . for sure ! i guess i ca n't blame nike . . . so they are just trying to make a profit ! it seems like the exploitation of you1 people tha tailor 'the brand thats all
15198,i agree with that as well . it seems to next big fad is around he corner and any brand out there is a risk of shaming if not liked it many . i just feel i would rather have a simple polo shirt . an wash and wear not costing me ana form and a leg so i ca purchase more than one color . i prefer the simple things .
15199,the simple things . . . i like that ! i wonder why rip curl has their clothes made in north korea but te label states made in china ? lol geez !
15200,"i would think maybe a component of each article may pa made in china and finished product in north korea , still uncertain as to why thought . i have heard of an interesting place hat sells thing lost from air sports in alabama and think it would be cool to visit ."
15201,yeah that would be really cool ! what is a collar gap ?
15202,collar gap is a term used by highes nd clothing makers todo determine the spanning on a shirt collar that has buttons or space between them .
15203,oh . . . interesting . . . would of never even thought of that ! see your simple polo shirt was actually invented for tennis ?
15204,"i am aware of that types ! i believe that from need comes product being that inventions form from products being needed and not available . for examples , certain attire comes from the need o far professional wanting to boost h expert o nra persona weeding to relax comfortably wears a tshirt ."
15205,i wan na work in hawaii so i do n't have to wear suit and tie !
15206,i feel hawaii would be a great place to work as well as experience the cultural differences available . i dot think however clothing would need to protect one from thee lemethns there on a full lime basis as hawaii does not experience the extreme differences in weather seasons as we do here on the main land .
15207,"that ' true , but i wonder if them wearing aloha shirts comes from comfort or tradition ?"
15208,"i feel it would be a part o both aspects . one looking for comfort from the heat eleemtns of the area they are in a swell as be somewhat fashionable forward witch thet in in question , forever ; protecting one from environmental elements ."
15209,"so , how m , ny polo shirts you have ?"
15210,i have a few on hand but being in te professional field i am in i seldom have the chance to wear them . i for certain prefer hot simple comfort but forced to upheld hte professional look for my field .
15211,"yeah , going a professional and upholding the look is not comfortable add cheap either !"

15246,"true , it you like shakespeare ?"
15247,i sure do . did you know he intentionally made mistakes in grammar in his plays ?
15248,"cool , id he have a reason or that ?"
15249,"yes , do that he would get the attention of the audience"
15250,wow that is creative . did you know he lived as the same tie as pocahontas
15251,"wow , that is amazing . do you know why the dealings exist in hte us ?"
15252,hmmm there is a specific reason for that ?

15261,"yea , comedy central has cancelled so many shows i found funny"
15262,"yeah that made me real mad , 100s hows in total since its creation in 1989"
15263,"yea , that averages out to 3 shows cancelled by comedy central a year"
15264,tha is a lot of them do you know the british comedy group monty python ?
15265,"yea , the creator of python programming named the language in honor of them"
15266,"i thought it was a funny group , do you like william shakespeare ?"

15268,"yeah talent like that one only comes once in a life time , did you know he was alive at the same time as pocahontas ?"
15269,"makes sense , shakespeare was born around 1564"
15270,"yeah and died in the year 1616 , he was a great poet , actor , writer and his plays ahve been translated into many languages ."
15271,plus shakespeare coined the phrases ' good riddance ' and ' laughing stock ' too
15272,"he also invented popular names we use ti this day like olivia , jessica nd miranda . he sure had a big impact in our culture ."
15273,it 's pretty crazy hat andre tchaikowsky donated is skull to the royal shakespear company in order for it to be used as a prop
15274,"that is cool , his skull is really famous i guess it was used in a series of performances of the famous play hamlet ."
15275,"yea , i wonder row many shakespeare works meryl streep has been in , shes 's a great actress and has been dominated for 18 oscars"

15284,i have and it wasnt all that great ! i dont know why bill think it was z monumental achievments !
15285,"really , maybe i dont need to see it then ."
15286,i woul suggest not ! just like the green lantern film . i think that one would have been better if htey had stuck with jack black
15287,btw would have even a totally a different movie . jack black is hilarious .
15288,i lol his movies k hs one om y favorite comedic actors for sure
15289,how did you feel about 3rd rock
15290,3rd rock from the sun ? the tv show ?
15291,yeah it won golden globes in 97
15292,what ! no way ! i wa super a huge fan of hat show . more of friends and seinfeld fan myself
15293,same here . so much funnier r friends i classic . pilot !
15294,' we car on a bleak '
15295,ha ! that is the best
15296,love it . did you know comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows . that really goes to show that a good comedy tv show s hard to come by
15297,"it is , although about 34 a year is what they cancel . so over time it all adds up ."
15298,"oh yea i guess thats less absurd obama . well i 'm going to go watch so , he friends , good chatting with you !"
15299,"hi , how are you this afternoon ?"
15300,good . you ? i 'm watching an ol meryl streep movie . . l
15301,"i 'm good , thanks for asking . i like metal street , i think she 's a good actress ."
15302,did you see her in the deer hunter ? she got an academy award nomination for that .
15303,"no , i didnt ' ? see her in that . i remember her in devil wears parade ."
15304,"yes , nice ! she learned a best supporting actress award in gamer vs . gamer . did you see he is that ?"
15305,"yes , i saw that one . she has so many ! hard to believe her first film role was a sports movie ."
15306,"i never saw it . she probably got nominated for that too . after all , she is the most nominated actress ever with like 18 nods . that 's more norms tran most actresses get robes in their lifetime !"
15307,"i hear ya ! very surprising that although she got nominated so many times , she has only won 3 times ."
15308,tough business . it was live to see he and stanley tucci rewrite in julie adn julia ! weir performances made me hungry !
15309,"i saw that one too , hey were awesome in it ."
15310,"yeah , and in tucci is lane excellent cook , he made streep cook for him in preparation for the role a 'the famous julia child ."
15311,that 's cool !
15312,i wonder what kind of preparation the did for her role in holocaust which earned her an emmy ?
15313,"idk , it was probably something very intense . i 'm sure ."
15314,do you know what producer dino de laurentiis said after she auditioned fo nra roll ; e in king kong ?
15315,"i heard he said in italian that she was ugly . but , was shocked when she replied abc to his insult in fluent italian . how funny !"
15316,"nice . i bet he wishes he could get those words ! she has even been nominated for 14 british academy awards , which is insane considering th amount of british went that had to be overlooked ."
15317,"that 's so true l on a different note , do you like shakespeare ?"
15318,"t used to be my nickname ! not because i am as old as shakespeare . . . in he was alive during the time of pocahontas , which is a little older than i . whats ' your take on shakespeare ?"
15319,"i love his works . was shocked to find out that he invented the names , miranda , jessica , and olivia . how cool !"
15320,"that is nice . and they are so popular still today ! on the other hand , nobody is named ? yorick ' anymore ! did you know that tchaikowsky donated his skull to the royal shakespeare theatre in hope of having i fused as a prop one day for yorick ?"
15321,"that 's very strange indeed . well it 's been nice chatting with you this afternoon . hop eyou enjoy the rest of you day , friend ."
15322,i hear nike got int trouble for selling a balaclava .
15323,i heard about that . ? critics said the design perpetuate violence with stereotypes of black youths nd gang culture . that 's sad !
15324,i just thought they were ski masks for using in the old and snow .
15325,"i agree the company was n't encouraging the issue of gang or criminal culture ep about it 's like everyone has to be careful wit what they say , do or rerelease these days ."
15326,i thinks more offensive thaat it sells or 92 . probably cost 1 to make . just because it 's got a designer label they can charge that much
15327,"so are . so very , very true . the cost i so ridiculous ! also , i did n't agree with that facebook video that was shared 38 , 000 times either where the guy claimed the item ' looks as managing as anything ice ever seen ' ."
15328,it just takes one statement to get forward to create a scandal . they seem morse important things going on in the rid to get worked up about .
15329,"so true . i mean , i doubt the pilgrims ever got worried ep over any of their wardrobe an it was always fill of color !"
15330,"i 've never worried too much about clothing , probably sour as much as the pilgrims did . my wardrobe is pretty basic , based on cost as nothing else ."
15331,so true . i wonder what kin doof wardrobe we could find in that alabama store that sells only clothes and cameras found in unclaimed baggage at airports .
15332,"i think that 's maybe where i do draws he like . i 'd sooner it new than second hand . some of my shirts new getting a little worn , maybe i should get z couple of new ones"
15333,same here ! o need to find a new button down . crazy how htey call it a button down because the collar tip fasten to the body of the shirt where button up does not !
15334,we shoudl move to hawaii . if not for the aloha shirt then for the sun ans sea !
15335,"ha ! so true . must be nice never having to wear a suit and tie especially been it 's hot out . that sounds so much more convenient ! on a related note , the pallbearers at billy mays ' funeral did n't ear a suit nad tie either , they wore khakis and blue shirts ! ha !"
15336,if that 's what you what then fine . i 'd love to go to one of those fancy functions like the academy awards in a tshirt and shorts .
15337,no kidding ! are you a fan of apple by chance ? they actually had their own clothing line back in 1986 . wonder what that was like ?
15338,"if i worked there i 'd feel oblige to wear it . yeah , i wonder what it looks like , i bet it 's not a 9 nike mash shirt with chest couch ."
15339,that 's the truth he i bet it products lost mork ethan smaller dinosaur fossils . r that glow in the dark dinosaur coin that canada has !
15340,i 'm still waiting for scientists to talk dinosaurs come back like jurassic park . then humans could live in ebay side with them
15341,"i mean , they 've managed to genetically alter chickens to express the dna their dino ancestors had , you anything is possible !"
15342,"it 'll happen one day , then we could all have a pet ex ."
15343,"so true . ha ! can atl think dinosaurs here mesothermic , in between warm and cold blood . must have been nice !"
15344,"hi , do you like fiction ?"
15345,i like some . i have read a lot of science fiction like asimov 's ' i robot . '
15346,cool . do you know who wrote the oldest cyborg in fiction ?
15347,not sure . i do know that i was taught asimov 's 3 lows of robotics in a robotics course i took in college .
15348,wow that is amazing . nasa apparently has a lot of words that writers can use ?
15349,coo .
15350,oh that is sad . do you know which actor holds the science fiction trifecta ?
15351,"again , not sure . i was surprised the l . rob hubbard was a scifi author . he 's in the book ' hte golden age o science fiction . '"
15352,nice . the actor is deep roy
15353,"nerve heard of ' deep roy ' until now . wow , the world 's longest piece of fiction is 4 million words long . that that toasty !"
15354,nicole . do you watch horror movies ?
15355,i watch my few . i ca n't stand slasher movie south i like stuff like alien . herd to believe e . t . was originally slated to be a horror movie .
15356,yeah that is strange . do you know how they make those scary sounds in those movies ?
15357,do n't know . i do know that the 1996 film ' scream m ' was originally going to be titled ' scary movie ' . was n't taht title used in a mock horror file ?
15358,they apparently use an instrument called a waterphone . it is so creepy
15359,i like science fiction ebert han horror saves though it got its start with mostly cheesy ' b ' movies .
15360,yeah . have you ever been to a fan convention ?
15361,"no . like grouchy marx , i would ' belong to a club that would have em as a member . i ca n't believe no one though the original exorcist moving would be considered ' horror or"
15362,yeah i was surprised about that too . and did you watch the shining ?
15363,yes . i 'll never forget ' red rum ' . . . there is a work of fiction called ' drabble ' that is exactly 100 words long . i wonder what it sold for ?
15364,"oh wow , that is short , what can one say ink 00 words ? nice chat : ,"
15365,are you a fan of the science fiction genre of film ? i like it because it uses concepts not fully accepted by mainstream science .
15366,so i am az an of science fiction . i especially love the spaceships nd interstellar travel of the star trek series .
15367,oh nice yeah that 's definitely really cool . nasa has a list of accurate space technology terms tthat writers can use in science fiction stories .
15368,i 've heard that . the writers do a lot of research win order to make the stories as real as possible .
15369,yeah i think that is very important the more realistic it is the more interesting . deep roy is the only actor to hold the sciencefiction trifecta . very cool .
15370,i do n't recognize his name though . what all has he been in ?
15371,"yeah actually i do n't either . he hs been in star wars , star the , and doctor who . he 's also been in xfiles ."
15372,"that 's pretty impressive . i 've heard that nasa has named attack s ther most accurate science fiction movie of all time . yet , i 've never heard of i teihtesr ."
15373,well i really need to look that up . the is science fiction society has both a lifetime membership and a more expensive one tthat covers you in case you do n't come back . that is pretty funny .
15374,it is ! i wonder how you become a member of that club !
15375,good question i 'm not sure . i also really like the horror film goer . btw as inspired by a literary authors like edgar allan poe and mary shelley .
15376,"oh , speaking of poe , di do know that he wrote the oldest known expel of a cyborg ?"
15377,no i never knew that that was quite interesting . matching horror movies is a very energy intensive task and you can burn up to 180 cal .
15378,"icy an believe that ! it probably speeds up a person 's heart rate so fast that it 's like running . is n't it odd that horror has been around since the days of poe , stoker , and shelley ?"
15379,"yeah very cool . or also overlaps with a fantasy , supernatural fiction , an thriller genres . that makes sense . kind of like a potpourri of genres ."
15380,it does . i ton watch a show about aliens and it ca be frightening in the extreme . have ou heard that watching a horror movie before viewing abstract art makes you like it more ?
15381,no i never knew that but i wil leave to try it sometimes . the water phone is the instrument that makes the creed ; in metallic noises in horror movies .
15382,really ? that 's interesting . it kind of takes some if teh scary ou otto know just how things are done in movies .
15383,yeah very true . the shining was another scary movie and it was very surprising that the little boy who acted in the movie did n't even know it was a horror film .
15384,true . did n't he find out several years later ? i 'd like to know how everyone kept him from knowing the truth for so long .
15385,"i would like to know that as well . stephen king found the mover bambi scary as a child , d . i find that kin do ironic ."
15386,do you hav epa favorites dinosaur ?
15387,"ye a , the area i cool , i are other dinos fro the cretaceous"
15388,"t he is awesome , i lke jurassic park movies because of the t he"
15389,"yea , jurassic park was an awesome emoji although i dont think any of the dinosaurs im it were from the jurassic period lol"
15390,"lol , i never knew that ! did you know there have been fossils found in all 50 states"
15391,"that is brett cool that all 50 states have fossils , i wonder hitch dinosaur fossil are in alaska"
15392,"or even hawaii , hat is far away from anything . 40 percent o americans trink that humans nd dinosaurs lived at the same time , that sees high"
15393,well technically birds are a type of dinosaur but i do n't think the 40 percent of americans knew that
15394,"that is true , i want to know what an actual dinosaur looked like and not that we think it does , that woul did amazing ."
15395,"yea , it be pretty cool if there were dinosaurs that lower in the dark like canada 's dinosaur coin"
15396,"that would be awesome , and at least you could see it coming in the dark lol . i never knew dinosaurs were mesothermic"
15397,"i wonder how scientists were able to figure out dinos wee mesothermic since we 've never seen them , unless they got that info from birds"
15398,i ponder how they have figured anything out or even knew where to start after indian the just one . so did blowing in my opinion !
15399,"yea , maybe one day they will be able to make a real dinosaur through altered chicken dna"
15400,i would love to see that day ! i would shake in my clothing in excitement
15401,"yea , he day there will be pet dinosaurs and you can buy dinosaur shirts with popped collars like chinese gang fashion"
15402,"lol i was hoping that died out and never again would come back , let those one day it does n't lol"
15403,"i hope they aloha shirt never dies out , it is the official business attire in hawaii"
15404,"that is awesome , i own a couple , but never have worn them . i might as well make a trip to hawaii ! it was so great chatting with you !"
15405,"you too , i 'm honda look on ebay for some of th original apple clothing from 1986"
15406,i am going to look in unclaimed dbagag alike in alabama and see if any are there . enjoy your evening !
15407,"hi , do are you ?"
15408,i 'm great ! how are you ? are you a fan of comic books ?
15409,"i am well , thanks . although not a fan of comic books per se , i do love comic hook movies like the black panther ."
15410,"b , and panther , a character created ? stan lee , the man who ended very phone conversation with the word ? excelsior ! ? '"
15411,ha ! i did not knkow that . what would be the word you ended phone calls with ? i end mine with ' peace out home boy ! '
15412,"i use ' word ' or ' and up , dawg . '"
15413,knife choice . that 's in my mexico too . i wonder what john zasbhbery uses ?
15414,"he 's a poet , so his command of language is far beyond that of is mere marthas . do you know what the dc in dc comics stands for ?"
15415,i do not ? district of colombia ?
15416,"detective comics , so dc comics is detective comics comics ."
15417,"ha ! i never knew that . there is a character that dc and marvel owns , access . . ."
15418,"i do n't really know hd characters well . i 've heard that there is a clark kent in the marvel universe , bu the 's just a reporter ."
15419,ha ! just a reporter . i do love superman . i did not know they own the trademark on super hero . . .
15420,"stats rounds like something that the lawyers crooked up . what will they trademark next ? the msu library has the largest comic cook collection in the world , the center of all things nerdy ."
15421,"i would assume that princeton or yale would have it , som hold money college with nothing eps to do but collect and strive to reach harvard the status ."
15422,"maybe they 'll do that for video game , the next big media boom ."
15423,yeah . there 's going to be a bit ewing al he video games are bout olsen and there will be no more gameboy . . ?
15424,"that might be a good thing ! gamestop , as dead as the dog , a bit taht is sport of the pigeon family ? ."
15425,nice transition ! bamestop might tags well fy to northern mexico and stay there .
15426,"gamestop could build a nest from spiderwebs , just like the hummingbird does ."
15427,hahaha . nice chatting with you !
15428,i had never heard of john ashbery before . what about you ?
15429,i am not into poetry as much as i should . i did hear that sir spare some poems that when you read them normally are depressing and when you read them backwards tey are inspiring .
15430,that backward reading of poetry was so new to me ! i think that that is really cool .
15431,what is even cooler is taht the japanese alphabet forms a poem with recited . that is overwhelmingly detail oriented .
15432,is it japanese or javanese alphabet ?
15433,"jabneese , spell checks is such a problem ."
15434,that 's true ! no to worry . consider thik amazing overwhelming and detail oriented concept the demetri martin coul write an extended palindrome poem that was 224 words long .
15435,poets definitely do n't get paid enough for their creativity and hard work . did you know that edgar allan poe only received 9 for is poem ' the raven n ' ;
15436,wow ! poor poe do you like comics ?
15437,"i liked the archie comics when i was a kid but i enjoy the marvel and dc comic inspired movies and tv shows , i only just found out that marvel owns the trademark for the term superhero ' and ' supervillain ' . how can one comic maker own those terms ?"
15438,that 's interesting fact about the trademark terms . i liked comics too but no really a big marvel fan . stan lee just died and i understand that he always closed his phone messages with the term excelsior ! i wonder if that was added to his epitaph on his grave . ?
15439,i would choose they would give him that epitaph wh e made a lot of cameo ' sin the recent movies . he was a big part of the genre . did you know that the dc of the dc comics stands for detective comic . the are similar but diferent .
15440,oh that 's clever ! dc for detective comics i am learning so much . so the poet and artist ashbery used comics andc other bits of ephmeera in his collage artwork . i nope some mimic collectors do n't get upset about this !
15441,i would think they would be fine wih the creativity . michigan state university ha 'the largest comic book collection in the world . i wonder if they have his in their library .
15442,perhaps michigan state does have his in their university library . i would hope so . i do quite like teh creativity involved witht added bits of incongruous bits of paper and childhood ephemera to create a piece of artwork . i do enjoy collage and childhood theories .
15443,the art of comics is a topic i enjoy . liechtenstein popularized the comic cage and gave the art more respect from the fine art world with the pop art movement .
15444,"do yoy recall the comic or maybe it was a cartoon with two black birds that wear hats ? those were very popular , it has some stereotypes and racist undertones . the only birds i see that i think are comical are pigeons . teh dodo bird come extinct is a form of pigeon ."
15445,i do not recall teh image you are talking about but it reminds me of the two black birds in the dumbo cartoon movie . definite racial overytures especially witht he music .
15446,some people are deadly afraid of birds . i have a friend who is afraid even by one stray feather ! can you imagine ? if you imagine being chased by a bird ? ashes did a collage of that too . a boy ewing chased by large bird .
15447,i can imagine . them movie the birds is a great example of why we would fear te birds . in ashes 's work the boy has returned is very creepy .
15448,yes indeed ! creepy . a bird head . i would like to imagine what it 's lilke to fly as a bird does . lingo and easy i imagine since the bird bones are hollow and amazingly weigh less than the feathers .
15449,so very interesting . thanks for the conversation .
15450,do you read comic books at all ?
15451,"hey ! when i was a child , i did , but not later mn ow i would say i do n't have interest . how about you ?"
15452,i am sorry but i do not understand what you mean ;
15453,how about you ? do you read comic books ?
15454,"no , not really . i do admire stan lee though ."
15455,i didnt ' know that google purchased the domain name gmail . co from garfield comics .
15456,"yeah , i believe that got a pretty good deal on the domain . garfield nwas n't getting much traffic on the site at the time ."
15457,interesting ! i 'm not comic books as popular as the were 20 years ago . . .
15458,many of them are still worth a great deal of money and ther eis still a demand for them or sure .
15459,"sorry or typing errors . i need to focus and do n't do all wat the same time : , in the last message my point was that i 'm not sure , but there is n't way to correct message . anyway you got my point lol"
15460,stan lee is an idol of made and i enjoyed his comic work tremendously .
15461,"captain america was his the first break , right ?"
15462,i thought i was spiderman but i could be wrong .
15463,"i do n't know . i remember iv ' e read that his wife destroyed his typewriter during an argument . i do n't know why , but i remember his moments from one article about him"
15464,did he write for marvel or dc comics ?
15465,"i guess marvel . iron man was marvel , right ?"
15466,i think so . he has been around comics so long that i bet he was one of the one that wrote the first one im america .
15467,i suess all comics universe could be totally different without stan lee
15468,i loved how he used to term ' excelsior ' .
15469,true . i think there are some many awesome facts about him . i 'm wondering is there any book about his life .
15470,i hve one autographed by him .
15471,hi k how are you ? waht do you think of our friend the sun ?
15472,stat eh is a real potty .
15473,"hes , he is . he come sup every day without fail . he is dependabl to and usually pretty warm . thoughhe e has his off days ."
15474,he is heavy to . about 330000 times as heavy as earth is .
15475,"well , he has tried to keep his weigh own , but what is he going to do at his age ?"
15476,the sun looks yellow but it is actually white .
15477,"i figure that he was being misrepresented jhn one way . boy , that really i unfair . he should be seen for what he is . nothing else ."
15478,you are right . as one white hot ball of burning gaza .
15479,he is quite hot . 've earth that the surface is not as hot as we think .
15480,yeah a lightning bolt is 5x hotter .
15481,i wish we could harness the energy of lightning . there must be a way .
15482,do you think a kite wand a key could point us in the right direction .
15483,i figure giant towers in areas with lots of lightning . then a big battery to store it .
15484,if it were that easy . i figure it would have been one already l
15485,i guess you 're right . i figure that the must be a way thought . i wonder how often lightning strikes . to would have to be enough to generate steady energy .
15486,i think solar is more the way to go . if they can make the solar cells cheap enough to make it worth it .
15487,"yes , solar i a better way to go . the energy source is steady and predictable . i wonder how much energy we can squeeze fro mothe old boy ."
15488,well the sun produces enough power in one second to power this planet for 50000 years
15489,you would have to capture all the energy from the sun with a dyson sure . that would be tricky . then you would have to store it all somehow . als tricky .
15490,we have huge power plants waht store native amount of energy . i think we could figure a way to store it . i think collecting it efficiently is the real problem .
15491,"yes , collection has theoretical limits . plugs teh material are expensive lane quite destructive o mine and fabricated . the sun is a great source of energy , but the challenge is capture ."
15492,i would sa we hav veto figure it out . everything else is unsustinable .
15493,"true . wr are entering a difficult time . more people , more demand for energy , anyway , great chat 2"
15494,welsh ave a goof one . i toyota go .
15495,"hi there , do you have any interest in space and stars ?"
15496,i think htey are fascinating . the sun is probably my favorite star .
15497,so cool . funny to think that when read think of the sun we think . it as being yellow bt in sad it is quite .
15498,"yes , it has fo do worth the atmospheric scattering . neat 's also teh reason the sky appears blue ."
15499,that is very interesting . the sun is so hot however the lightning bolt is surface of the sun by 5 times .
15500,wow . that puts new perspective on getting hit by lightening . the sun is a small star as well . it 's 1 billionth teh time of the biggest star in the galaxy .
15501,"yeah , so amazing . since its discovery in 1846 neptune ha sfinnaly been able to complete a full orbit around the sun in 2011"
15502,ho interesting . did you know that the sun is almost a perfect sphere ?
15503,so cool . the sun even accounts for over 99 percent of the folks molar system mass
15504,"that makes sense considering that it i 330 , 00 times heavier than the earth ! it produces a lot of energy as well ."
15505,"so true . changing topics , a re you a fan of literature and books ?"
15506,yes i am . one of my favorite poets is oscar wilde !
15507,"oh nice . he is amazing for sur of a lot of people like him , like olivia wilde , who changed her last name in his honor ."
15508,"i did n't know about that ! he is very dearly loved , though . his tomb is covered in lipstick !"
15509,"and he had a good sense of sumo r , once saying to the border agents , i have nothing to declare but my genius ."
15510,haha ! i love that . he was certainly a eccentric guy . h also wrote some great poems about his time in prison .
15511,"speaking of the tomb and the lipstick that you mentioned , if you get caught there is a lefty price to pay ."
15512,"yes i know ! 12 , 000 . i wonder if they have cameras watching it ."
15513,could be . crazy relations between literature and governments sometimes . like when the fda burned six tons of literature during a us censorship ;
15514,"there 's very true ! or government writing literature , such as when winston churchill won a nobel prize in literature !"
15515,exactly . . was nice chatting wit hyou .
15516,"hi , do you ike to travel"
15517,"i do , especially pub crawl in europe"
15518,"what is pubs crawl , i am curious"
15519,going firm pub to pub in london ; you can also get there by double weicker bus
15520,"ohh , i see . i love to go from pub to pub one day in my life to enjoy hte experience . have you traveled a lot"
15521,"ye s , i actually just got back from a dublin literary pub crawl ."
15522,"wow , it is amazing . i am so jealous of your wonderful experience . btw , i am kind of surprised that the sun is white , not light yellow color as we perceive"
15523,how far is earth fro the sun ?
15524,ish haven o idea . but it must be very far because if not our human being has been burned to distinction already because of the sun 's extreme heat
15525,i believe the sun 's diameter is well over 1 mil ; ion kilometers in diameter
15526,"i know it is big , but not exactly how big l hahaha . btw , did you know that lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of th sun , approximately 5 times hotter"
15527,"wow , tha i amazing . i did not know that but i do know that helium can also be found on the sun"
15528,"yeah , i hear a lot about helium and some of his uses such east o pump it into a billion . i do not know about other uses of helium gas"
15529,helium was found on the sun before 6 was found here on earth
15530,"ohh , i see . did you know that the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star i nor galaxy"
15531,life on mars at night is amazing at the sunset is the and not black like here on earth
15532,i wish our earth could have a blue color instead fb lack becase black color makes me depressed . hahaha
15533,is the sun blocking your internet signal tonight ?
15534,"i hope not , if that is the case l my holiday will be ruined . hahaha"
15535,i las worried the sun or mookie had voided the warranty on your computer
15536,enjoy your holiday . bye
15537,tell oscar wilde to keep up the wonderful acting
15538,hey did you know that the sun is actually white ? it 's only our atmosphere that makes it yellow
15539,"i did actually , i watch a lot ot shows about the universe ."
15540,do of know any cool facts ? like how lightning is 5x hotter than the sun ?
15541,"i is n't know that . but i know that the sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire eplnaet foe 500 , 000 years ."
15542,"ya i was we could harness that better somehow , that would really solve the energy crisis ! also , i miss pluto as a planet haha"
15543,"yeah , it would solve a lot of our world 's problems ."
15544,do you read books ? i can ; t believe the fda burned about 6 tons of actual books
15545,interesting . do you know why ?
15546,"i think it wasa n act of censorship because the books were not factual , but that still seems like lean extreme thing yo do"
15547,"weird , so they were fiction books ?"
15548,"yes i think so , i 'd have to find more information , did you know that romantic kissing is a recent invention ?"
15549,"no , i did n't , but it would surprise e . is that what churchill won a nobel prize for ? kidding !"
15550,"haha ! swell i don ' thank so , it sounds like he won it for peace , but he was also apparenlty quits a ladies man haha"
15551,"hilarious . there was a contest to come up with the worst possible sentence to a novel , did you lol that ?"
15552,"haha no i did n't what was theft final sentence , i must know !"
15553,"i do n't know either , i just heard about it . pretty funny !"
15554,"haha i was just thinking next time i 'm with my girlfriend and she goes for a kiss , i 'll tell her i do n't believe in kiss , it 's a decent invention lol"
15555,hilarious . did you know oscar wilde 's were about his wallpaper ?
15556,"haha ho i did n't , i never read any of his work did you ? i like his phrase to us customs though : i have nothing to declare except my genius ' haha"
15557,"i read a few of his books . kissing his tomb could result in a 12 , 000 in !"
15558,wow that 's expensive ! i can think of a lot better things to kiss though personally haha
15559,did you know theres ' a wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities .
15560,thats amazing ! edgar allen poe wrote he oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction .
15561,wow ! julius caesar wrote fan fiction of hercules and oedipus in his youth .
15562,"haha states funny ! george rr martin despises fan fiction , saying that it is copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers ."
15563,surprising ! in the 1960s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character .
15564,"that 's so dumb . stephen king was terrified as a child when eh saw the movie bambi , calling it the first horror movie he saw l"
15565,"wow , from king ? watching horror movies can burn up more than 180 calories ."
15566,"yeah , i just read that , i might need to watch more of the !"
15567,"if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art , you will enjoy the art more"
15568,"thet ' ; s good to , now ! they majority of creepy metallic noises in scifi or horror movies are made by an instrument called a waterphone ."
15569,"really ? ! ? ! ? danny , the boy from the shining , did not know he was acting in a horror film until several years later ."
15570,"lol that , so have been disturbing ."
15571,probably ! i would be scared . . .
15572,ive heard the noises from walking dead and most zombie noise are just someone eating chicken .
15573,really ? strange ! nasa has a lot of accurate space technology terms that writers can use in science fiction stories
15574,starship troopers is the only science fiction novel recommended by three of the five branches of the us military .
15575,term ' robotics ' was accidentally coined by science fiction author isaac asimov in 1941 .
15576,"what does ' coined ' mean ? an ancient greek wrote a sciencefiction story over 1 , 800 years ago , featuring plantbased aliens living on th moon"
15577,created . he created the there . . .
15578,oh interesting !
15579,"an ancient greek wrote a sciencefiction or over 1 , 800 years ago , featuring plantbased aliens living on the moon"
15580,its been great talking to you !
15581,do you like to read horror stories ?
15582,"i do n't read that much , do you ?"
15583,"yes i read lots off fiction . but not many horror stories nor science fiction , bu the are quite popular , even edgar allen poe wrote a story about cyborg ."
15584,"yeah , i remember he wrote the raven , right ?"
15585,"i think that is him , or at least he is a horror writer . he is a winner of th genre like bram stoker ."
15586,"yeah , he wrote it . even t e . t . ?"
15587,"no , i think i am the only one in north america tha thas not seen it , was it any good ?"
15588,"it is really good , i highly suggest you watch it !"
15589,what more is it ? is it sciencefiction ?
15590,sci fi and dram i would say .
15591,"do you like sciencefiction movies ? i like the fact taht it is almost real , based on logic ."
15592,"i like them some times . i like star trek , or used to . the older star wars were good too . what about you ?"
15593,"j like stories by isaac asimov . and i also like starship troopers , even if it is a little campy ."
15594,"i have a few isaac asimo books . i saw starship troopers , campy it is , but it was a well done movie ."
15595,"the book is also took , it is recommended by 3 of the 5 branches of th military , i do n't know if it is a good thing or not ."
15596,"yeah , i 'm a bit surprised by that , are n't you ?"
15597,"yes , everyone like to read , i guess soldiers too , they have to occupy the time between assignments ."
15598,that is so true ? it you know that ray bradbury wrote spaceships garth ?
15599,"no , i did not , i did not even heard of the title . what it is about ?"
15600,"i 'm not entirely sure to be honest . lol ! well , nice chattin with you !"

15605,lil that is true . mary shelly did frankenstein right ?
15606,yes . i gues that would be classic . although steven king is no slouch . the spooky thames .
15607,"i lilke his movies , appasre3mtly he thouhg bambi was a horror movie"
15608,yes lol read that . most are predictable to me . like the one with guys running at you with chain saws . i must like the suspense better and king ca certainly do that .
15609,for sure lol . i heard in the shining the boy named danny didn ' know ut was a horror movie until years later .
15610,they probably did n't want to scare him for life . that was excellent . hot know how many times i 've seen it .
15611,"i have only even it i once but know its famus . that would have scared the kid for sure , good point . i like watching horror movies before going to art galleries"
15612,is it true hat you can enjoy art better after doing so ?
15613,"tat is what i have heard , i like it a lot when i do that and go , i recommend it ! are you into fiction at lab ?"
15614,i read alot yes . mostly fiction .
15615,"me too , i like science fiction also , robotic stash coined by isaac asimov in 1941 , good word now"
15616,note familiar with that author . or maybe do n't recognize the name . gon na google him . alien on of my favorites i tthat category .
15617,"i love those alien type movies , which is your favorite ?"
15618,oh my . teh 're endless . theft first was written over 1800 years ago by an ancient greek !
15619,"that is awesome , id id not know that ! i was a big starship troopers fan"
15620,skates you wonder if it was scifi or if aliens did visit us thousands o fears ago .
15621,"dang , that is solid , there is al ot of conspiracy around tht ! it was nice chatting wit you , i am going to look at theories lol"
15622,yes thank you . go my interest sparked here too .
15623,let me know what you find ! have a good day !
15624,do you like movie ?
15625,i love movies ! how about you ?
15626,ny genre ?
15627,i like stephen king movies . i see he called bambi the first horror movie he ever saw .
15628,i like teh horror tenure
15629,watching horror movies can burn up more than 180 calories ! i wonder why i lose weight more when i was them ; lol
15630,"usually a hit or miss , simply depends on th movie"
15631,"there ! if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art , you will enjoy th bart more . so member that next time before you go to an art museum !"
15632,i think horror films do a good job with the music to set the atmosphere
15633,i agree . the creepy metallic noises that you hear while watching horror movies are made by an instrument called a waterphone .
15634,the waterphone indeed dis a unique looking instrument
15635,"i ? ve never seen one before . i ' l , have to look it up . the boy from the shining danny did n't know he was acting in a horror movie until several years late . lol"
15636,ya i think th horror genre is very subjective
15637,are you a fan of tom cruise ?
15638,"yes , he is a great actor"
15639,tom cruise spent 2 years learning japanese and swordplay in preparation for the filming of ' the last samurai ' . what dedication to his craft !
15640,"the plot of the last samurai is cliche , but he pulled it off well in that movie"
15641,"50m cruise once threatened tom kruse , the inventor of the hoveround over the usage of his name . that seems in of like a petty thing to do ."
15642,"personally while i respect his acting skills , i am not too interested in them as a person . then again , you are right in that it is quite petty"
15643,he 's in of wacky for sue . he spent 10 illion on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens . lol
15644,"hey who am i to judge ? he has the money to spend anyway . in any case , thanks for chatting"
15645,yo got it q i enjoyed the chat !
15646,hi how are you ? what do you think of the sun ?
15647,are you talking about the top at the center of our solar system or the magazines ?
15648,"o h , i guess i would walk about both . ut les start with our friend at the center of our solar system ."
15649,"apparently , helium is the only element o hve been discovered on the sun , before it was discovered on earth ."
15650,"yes , that is interesting . i guess helium is hard to date because it is not very proactive ."
15651,i agree with you . i am surprised to kno that the sun makes up 99 . 86 percent of the mass of our solar system .
15652,"i figure it was a lo , but it is also all the mass . the planets are tiny ."
15653,i also found out from a scientific magazine that the sunset on mars is blue .
15654,"yes , the atmosphere i different ! that must be pretty cool . i dont want to ive there though ."
15655,i do not want to live there either . apparently there s a radio station that translate solar activity into sound and you can listen live to the sun 's music . i wonder what radio station it is .
15656,i wonder what that sounds like . it is calming like the sound of the surf ? or reading like the roar of the wind '
15657,i do not think it would sound calming .
15658,probably not . it wold be better to work on catering energy from teh sun .
15659,do you know that the sun 's mass is about 330000 times that of earth ?
15660,"yesh , what snakes sense . w late but a tiny speck in the solar system ."
15661,"it is scary . i something bumps intel our earth , we are doomed ."
15662,"lol ; , we will need to develop a program that would destroy meteor and stuff . elon musk ?"
15663,we should develop a program . no one has spoken about it though .
15664,"the space force ! didnt trump propose something like this ? who will join the space force ? ? anyway , great hat !"
15665,it was nice talking to you . good night .
15666,have a great weekend !
15667,i want to learn more about the sun and our solar system . thank you for the info i learned a lot from you . good night .
15668,good afternoon ! have you seen any good movies lately ?
15669,"hello ther , hot in that are ou in the theatre right now but on t . v . i have . are you a tom cruise fan ?"
15670,i am . i 'm a fan of his earlier movies . just loved him in top gun nd cocktail .
15671,"awesome , i am the same way . give me 80 's cruise all day , cocktail is a great movie ."
15672,i az surprised 5o learn that he spent 10 million on an underground bunker to protect him from aliens .
15673,yeah that sounds pretty crazy to me . did you know he spent wo years learning japanese and using samurai swords in prez . that movie the last samurai ?
15674,i did not . i have n't seen that one either . hopefully the 2 years sas worth it ! i bet the cinematography was good on that one . they ave better and better equipment as the years go on .
15675,yeah i think you are right . cinematography is pretty interesting . did you know roger deakins a cinematographer has been nominated for 13 oscars and never won ?
15676,"that is crazy ! i 'm sure he does n't feel that , ' it is nice for be nominated . ' i 'm also surprised a woman has never been nominated for cinematography ."
15677,"yeah is n't that wild , you figure at being nominated so many views he would win . and i am too , i think that il ; shange pretty soon here ."
15678,horror films ? love them or hate them ? ?
15679,i like them . but in my opinion it is pretty hard to make a goo horror film . did you know watching horror films can burn a lot of calories ?
15680,"i 'm not a huge fan , but watch them o occasion . i can imagine they would burn many calories . my heart is pounding the whole time !"
15681,yeah i can understand why they dot you . do you know what most of the metallic noises heard in those films id made by ?
15682,no i do n't . what is it made by ?
15683,i guess its an instrument ca ; lend a waterphone . i am really curious to see that this thing actually looks like .
15684,"i 'm not sure , but i bet it is the ; y looking . stephan king is a great writer of horror films . what is your favorite ?"
15685,"yeah he sue did , i always liked teh original night of the living dead , the one in black on white . i thought it was good . how about you ?"
15686,i really like it or pet cemetery . i like the original it better .
15687,yesh i did n't see then ew it that name out recently but the old one is one of hte best i agree .
15688,great talking with you !
15689,"same here , i hope you have a good day !"
15690,"well there , do you watch many horror films ?"
15691,hi ho ware you ? no i don but i do like some of them
15692,i am well thank you . i think it is really hard 5o do a good horror film to bed honest .
15693,"sued , people are expecting to be scared they know that something is going to happen . how doyou surprised them ? hard ."
15694,"exactly , plus as soon as it get sa little bit lame , it loses the horror aspect for me ."
15695,"yes , it is hard to maintain the tension . a missteps spoil hte illusion . just like bambi did for me ."
15696,"lol , yeah that is very true . did you know the young actor in the shining , did n't know he was making a horror film ?"
15697,i gues he was naive ? want did he think it was ?
15698,i do n't kno what kid of movie you think you are acting in when there is a ton of fake blood around ?
15699,i guess he thought it was an adventure ? who knows . maybe he was a slow kid .
15700,do you know what kind of instrument makes all of those metallic sounds in those movies is called ?
15701,"um , i have no idea . is it a special instrument or something ?"
15702,i best it is called a waterphone m and yeah i think it is just used it movie effects .
15703,"a waterphone , like a saxophone ? i guess that is a unique instrument ."
15704,"i am not sure to be honest , i wonder what it does look like ?"
15705,i guess it has water in t ? maybe it just sounds try . i guess it is useful for i work . do you like tom cruise ?
15706,"yeah i do like tom cruise e , but mostly his older movies . do you have a favorite of hi s ?"
15707,"i likd hid performance in aikman . he wa salsa goods in top gun , born on the 4th of july ."
15708,"yeah that movie news really good , and both of those ones too . i alway spiked risky business ."
15709,"that was a breakout role for him . great casting , fun story . anyway , great chat there !"
15710,yeah seems here it was good talking with you today !
15711,hello ! are you a movie lover ?
15712,"yes , but i like things like ethan hawke playing a tortured protesting priest ."
15713,"first reform ? i have not seen it , but i hear it is a good fil , even if many oviegoers are uncomfortable with the content ."
15714,"i likes stuff like that more than say , mission i , possible . if you took hte action scenes and stunts out soft hose movies , t here would n't be muh left ."
15715,"yeah . when i was young , action was interesting . as i can e , i appreciate the subtle elements more than the typical mission impossible formula of action , stunts , and familiar dialogue . i prefer something wit ha litle depth ."
15716,"the same here . i do think there is a difference between ' critic mobiles ' and ' audience movies ' . i think with age one looks more for meaning , more like a critic ."
15717,"perhaps . although there ia something heroic about sending an old man like me , tom cruise is in his 50s , who can still run without groening ."
15718,"lol . yeah , good point . i did like him in risky business back when i could run without groening ."
15719,"but hollywood looks for syllables overs that ca make money , and cruise can deliver in that category most of the time . hollywood is betting on a prequel o mama mia , with predicalbe refurbishing of abba songs and amish wiggling to music . and yet , i still want to see that one l"
15720,"yeah , it 's funny how things repeat themselves . i 'm ok with that bu ti don ' 5 really like anything from the horror genre to return . life 's har enough without horror in my free time . it encourages violence ."
15721,"i guess a good movie is one you do n't mind watching more than once . there are n't many horror movies i can say yes to that . besides , watching a horror movie can burn up to 180 calories . who wants tat ?"
15722,"yep , i do n't know if aliens is considered horror but i 've seen it more than once ."
15723,"i remember hovering as i read th original novel , alien . tenure were some gory scenes . comedy is easier to take i i wish seinfeld was still on the air . seinfeld rocketed over 800 , 000 , 000 , so i guess he can afford to vacation for a decade or two ."
15724,hee yeah . . . loved seinfeld . . . lot 's of money for a show that 's about trivialities . . . i really like poe when reading . maybe its the cinematography that stresses me to lose all those calories .
15725,"yeah , seinfeld is worth more than tome cruise and tom hanks combined . i guess people will pay more for a comedian than for an actor ."
15726,"seinfeld shaw a wellrounded cast . i still recall certain things and chuckle to myself , e . g . , the golf ball in the whale , . i do n't relive horror movies in a good way like that ."
15727,"true . ' i cna't spare a square ! ' and depite al 'the hilary , seinfeld never seemed to make really unusual decisions like so many tv stars . like cruise , wo spent 10 million to build an underground bunker ti project himself from aliens ."
15728,agree ep hey kept it on a hilarious steady pace . seinfeld has common sense .
15729,"here is some trivia that defies common sense : did you know that if you watch a horror movie before you go to the art gallery , you will enjoy the art more ? incredible , b u true !"
15730,hmmm . it sure about that . maybe for some are but i our n't see that working for a norman rockwell exhibit .
15731,"maybe it only works fdr modern art ? hey , nice chatting with you ! stay away from those horror movies now , like the dreaded , ' bambi ' that stephen king once described as the first horror movie he ever saw ."
15732,do you know that the sun is actualy white ?
15733,"yeah , something to o weigh the atmospe4hre scattering the light or somethings ."
15734,"when i was a kid , i though it was yellow ."
15735,yeah me too . apparently a lightning bolt is like 5 times hotter than the surface of the sun . that 's hot !
15736,"that is very hot . also , i thought that the sun is as big as the other stars in or galaxy ."
15737,"a , its like a billionth the size of the biggest . imagine rotating around that kind of sun ."
15738,"so , it 's very tiny . i 'm always interested in scientific facts ."
15739,yeah pretty interesting stuff . here 's some scene for you . the hummingbird steals spiderwebs to build their bests .
15740,i did not know that . they are very caught !
15741,"birds skeletons are mostly hollow candw weigh , less than the feathers too ."
15742,that was interestin . i did not know that da lso m their respiratory an digestive systems are adapted for flight in a unique way .
15743,did n't know that . i suspect waterfowl have those adapted for swimming then too .
15744,it 's very possible ? i also heard about unique birds in australia that can make various sounds .
15745,"yeah , they can imitate things like chainsaws . really cool !"
15746,they can also make ca alarms and camera sound .
15747,"that 's impressive . another weird bird fact , farmers used to walk turkeys to the market in the 18th century in england . they made custom boots for the turkeys to walk in ."
15748,that 's very interesting . please tell me more about weird things related to animals .
15749,i do n't know if i have any more animal facts off he top of mt 4am but speaking of boots nokia got their start making boots .
15750,i did not know that . i always thought that they made othe types of electronics before cell and smart phones .
15751,yeah weird uhhuh . one boot i 've always thought was super ugly are ugg boots . you ?
15752,"i knw that rand . anyway , i 've got to run . nice chatting with you ."
15753,tell ! do you like to listen to music ?
15754,"yes , i love music . did you know there 's version of the tarzan soundtrack that ace in different languages ?"
15755,"interesting , i wonder how many different languages . i want to listen to the jaws soundtrack though . steven spielberg playes the clarinet in it !"
15756,music played with movies has such a resoanting effect . i have certain associations with songs because of the way there were played in movies
15757,"yes they really catch you , especially the batman begins soundtrack where every track title is named after a bat !"
15758,it is always fun t learn such things like that . it was also fun to know that the tron legacy soundtrack was negotiated by daft punk as they wore their robot helmets .
15759,that is very interesting 21 i wonder where they get their clothes and musks fro m ?
15760,"maybe they got their clothes and masks from mars ! if not mars , maybe it 's moon has people once thought was made by something or someone ."
15761,"who would have lived that ! it does n't seem li , e it but the highest point of the moo is 1938 meters higher than mt everest ."
15762,"i wonder what else is tie in tha universe . our moon is the fifth largest in the solar system , but who knows how big moons can be in places we 've never seen ."
15763,i wonder that too ! i 'm glad apollo 11 put an american flag n the moon !
15764,"yeah i agree , an american flag was a good decision . i 'd be scared to get moon hay fever if i went on the moon ."
15765,that way a great decision indeed 2 i cant believe apple had a clothing line in 1986 !
15766,that wild be mindblowing i they started developing smart clothes .
15767,i wonder how much those are worth nowadays ? u 'm sure we could ind some at the alabama store that alleys clothes nad cameras from unclaimed luggage .
15768,that store must have such novelties in their inventors !
15769,i 'm sure it does ! i ponder if there are any close with moon dust for material ?
15770,the pilgrims did n't often wear black . that makes e question my mn wearing of black clothes .
15771,"interesting , we were always taught they did ! i wonder what history actually was like lol ."
15772,i definitely want to her some of apple 's clothing line s .
15773,i will have to go look them up on ebay to see what is there ! well have a great day !
15774,hi do yo have a favorite item of clothing ?
15775,i love my t shirt sand jeans . did you know pilgrims only wear black clothing on special ocassions ?
15776,teach and otherwise they are in their beautiful adn colorful clothing lol the time
15777,yeah i like those too . do you know how people in fashion an tell if you need your clothes tailored ?
15778,yes they lo for collar gaps in your clothes
15779,yeah that is it . there is a north korean and of clothing that says made in china
15780,haha oh the irony . apple used to have a clothing line too actually
15781,yes back ish 86 but i am not sure that happened to it i do not think it ia still around
15782,yes i do not think so either . there is a store ina alabama where you can get stuff that was left at airports
15783,"nice , i wonder what they have there . do you know much about the moon ?"
15784,"i know some stuff like , the largest moon of mars is hollow , one third of it"
15785,wow that is neat . a moon of saturn titan is believed to have methane based life
15786,"wow i am not surprised really tough , the universes is so vast and there iss o much we do not know yet"
15787,exactly . before apollo 11 landed on moon nasa had though about putting un flag ther knot the american one
15788,wow interesting one . the highest point on the moon is 1938 higher than everest
15789,"wow because everest is not high enough , that is just insanely high"
15790,yes exactly . moon dust is apparently harmful to humans
15791,yes it causes a disease called moon hay fever . that sound funny but it is scary
15792,wow and it is so powerful i scan actually cut through kevlar like material
15793,"wow , pretty tough indeed . do you know what is the moon 's orbital distance ?"
15794,"i do not know that actually , must be a very large number i assume"
15795,"yes it is actually you are right , it is 4 40s km"
15796,wow that is a cool alot fore sure
15797,did you know that humans domesticated horses around 4000 bc ?
15798,i did know that !
15799,how about that horses have only one toe ?
15800,"that 's super weird , is n't it ? firefighters used horses before trucks and used the dalmations to calm the horses !"
15801,"interesting . i know of a guy in northeastern oklahoma who is paid yt he givernment to allow wild horses to run on his large ranch . however , they are not really wild , only few because they are from ancestors who were domesticated ."
15802,i 've heard that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads do you think taht 's really true ?
15803,"no . i have seen the patch , n't i have seen many arises being ridden by people ayn some of those horses id not hav seth empathy . there is one species that is truly wild ."
15804,those fancy lipizzaner horses they use for dressage are apparently born black or brown and take 6 years to turn completely white i gues 'you wouldnt be able to see a white patch at that point .
15805,good point . the truly wild species is called przewalski 's horse . probably no one wants tho domesticate it because htey to n't want to have to spell it .
15806,"haha ! true ! well , there are like 20 quintillion individual animals on earth , so there are plenty to domesticate wits ay easier spelling !"
15807,"wow ! i would n't even guess that there were that many living cells , much less animals . for consume organic material ."
15808,"i know , right ? the 's really interesting . i havent ' studied much about zoology , the study of animals , , but there are over 1 . 5 million living animal species that have been described , 1 million of them are bugs ! , , but there are probably over 7 million animal species total ."
15809,god commander man go subdue the earth . we are compelled diy our nature to study eferyhting and such o fit has a payoff . scotland has a law hat protects the loch ness monster .
15810,"that 's hilarious i guess they really thought it might exist , maybe it does ? ? , germany apparently was the first country to give animal constitutionallyguaranteed legal rights , aurprisignly ."
15811,"i hope germany did not go too far . i think animals have tshirt place and should not be mistreated , but rights ?"
15812,"it seems like a difficult thing to enforce , and i 'd be interested in learning more about the details . does it include all animals , like the 7 million species we were talking about ? , or just like pets and farm animals ? that ca n't possibly work for meat production . . ."
15813,"tru . you ca n't be charged wit ha crime for stepping obj an nat , for instance . they can not be that silly ."
15814,"definitly true ! but laws and rules can be outdated or weird sometimes . i 'm not sure where it was , but somewhere these two students got suspended for riding their horses to school on 'no vehicles to school day ' , not sure what that is exactly , but that seems unfair , right ! ?"
15815,ia see with you . a horse is not a vehicle . they say that hiccups ar an holdover from when animals had both gills and lungs . i would like to see the missing links that prove that .
15816,"hiccuping is wen your diaphragm gets kicked up or something i thought maybe tha nwas somehow reacted to gills , who knows ? maybe we ie use to be part sea creature and swim in the oceans . hey , that reminds me have you seen that movie cast away ?"
15817,yes . i 've never made friends with as soccer ball however . i like tom hanks . nice chatting !

15865,"yes , he gave the horse apples and had positive emotions ."
15866,apparently icelandic horse have a fifth speed .
15867,"really intresting , negative emotions lead to a grudge holding horse ."
15868,"is that right ? also the fifth speed is ' that ' it 's basically speed walking , haha !"
15869,oh wow ! one to see that ! westerns were made mostly by then makes sense
15870,yeah now that does . clint eastwood had a midlife allergy to horses . to bad since he played in so many movies with them . i wonder if he just got tired of westerns ?
15871,"i do n't know , loved his movies ! i would love to tickle a horse , as long as he did n't kick back k ! lol"
15872,"yeah that could definitely hurt you , if it kill you those things ar strong ."

15891,oh cool what is that one about ?
15892,the first professional womans baseball league . he plays a wlelmeaning but drunk and also hilarious manager .
15893,i 'm surprised he played a drunk in tha movies . . . i'ts been said that he wont take the role of a bad guy .
15894,"he started off a bit sinister , but he wa more of a funny drunk than a serious one ."
15895,oh ok . . got it ! are you an animal glover ?

15902,good chatting with you
15903,hi ! do you like horses ? ' di you know clint eastwood has a mail horse allergy ?
15904,"hello , yes love horses , so beautiful . thats so interesting considering he was in all those western movies lol did you know 95 percent of all modern thoroughbred racehorses can trace theur y chromosomes to on horse ?"
15905,i did n't that 's crazy ! dalmatians are calming to horses so that 's why firefighters use to have them all the time .
15906,taht is interesting . i find it weird that once an icelandic horse leaves iceland it an never return . that is something i woul drive to learn more about ol
15907,"ya , i wonde why that is ? i didnt ' know horses have speeds , but just found out that icelandic horses have a 5th speed which is speedwalking ."
15908,"yeah that interesting too ! i think it is called the tolt . fun fact , the length of horse hair is related to how much sun a horse gets !"
15909,living in the north i 'm glad hat does n't determine how much our hair grows . i wonder if they un affects that lipizzaner horses are born black or brown but turn white in 6 years ?
15910,"thats pretty cool . did you know horses , sharks and orangutans are ticklish ? who pickled a shark to find that out lol"
15911,no and what did it do . . . laugh ? lol ! did you know hiccups are still around from early evolution when land nails had gills and lungs ?
15912,niche . i wouldnt mind having gills if it meant i could swim for longer lol
15913,me too ! i love swimming . do you believe in the loch ness monster ? it 's a protected species in scotland .
15914,"i do believe that it once was live , but i dont believe it still is . that seems right t , i bet htey would put it in a museum or old of some sort ."
15915,"ya , i wonder why more people do n't go into animal studies . . . seems like a stable career choice nice there are 20 quintillion individual animals ."
15916,"yeah ! did you know there are lobster and jellyfish that are immortal ? immortal , as long as nothing kills them they can technically live forever ."
15917,i wonder how the ocean is n't overrun with them then ? ! have you noticed how many cats and dogs have white patches on their foreheads ? taht 's because it happens when they 're domesticated .
15918,the ocean isnt over rum with them because lobster is delicious lol not only do humans eat lobster ut probably a lot of sea creatures find them delicious do lol i have never noticed that about the patches .
15919,hat 's a good point ! i 'm kind of glad i do n't live in germany because they gave animals constitutional rights . . . sorry but i do n't agree with that because they ca n't show agreement .
15920,what kind of rights do the give them ?
15921,"i 'm not sure , but any rights is a little weird to me . i 'll go see if i can find the answer . nice chatting with you !"
15922,same you too !
15923,have a good night !
15924,did you see ocean 8 ?
15925,no i have not . i have seen ocean 's eleven through thirteen
15926,it was pretty cute . it was the all female version of the oceans movie . they robbed the met gaza .
15927,is that he movie with sandra bullock and anne hathaway in it ?
15928,"yes . sandra bullock plays danny ocean 's , sister . i love watching tune met bala fashions and celebrity cameos ."
15929,did any of the lady 's get n oscar for their performances ?
15930,"no , but the met golf is a fun event with crazy fashions like at the oscars ?"
15931,"did you know that eminem has more oscars than leonardo decaprio , johnny depp , will smith , george lucas and bill murray combined ?"
15932,"no , but i can believe it . daniel day lewis i actually the only actor to win the best actor oscar threat mimes ."
15933,no way ! thats cool . i think alot disney shoudl the record for the most though .
15934,"that makes sense . he made a lot of movies 12 evidently up until the 90th oscars , they had given out over 3 , 000 since the conception of the award ."
15935,that 's a lot of awards ! but i think that awards first aired on tv in 1953 . so i do n't understand how they got to the 90th award ceremony . they must have done it on radio prior to tv .
15936,"actually , the academy awards first broadcast in 1930 , then was televised in 1953 ."
15937,that make sense . i 've always wondered by they broadcast the awards in or ethan 200 countries . i did n't even think americans were that popular abroad .
15938,"american cinema is pretty popular , in general . i did n't realize amazing saddles was nominated for 3 oscars , let alone any at all !"
15939,with how political the awards ave gotten i am surprised anyone watches them . but they even air them live online . but who wants to watch aw bunch of pompous rich peole complain about things that they should just keep their mouths shut about .
15940,"i mean , i tend to agree with their politic up what 's so wrong about wanting to take care of each other ? a lot of celebrities do nicer things than i do , like dressing up in costume and goin to hospitals to visit it children n ."
15941,"they are so full of themselves . . i mean the awards ceremony get nominated for emmys , more awards , . just rich people petting themselves on the back . all at the expense of common people rewatching their movies ."
15942,"i mean , it ' are ? we pay for art all of the time . everyones has to earn a living . trump begged to be voted for a nobel prize . awards exist for everything . i do n't think it 's so terrible to get to wear costumes for a living ."
15943,i dont even watch teh cma ' anymore because of how political theses how have gotten . i have been to la sphere tobey held the last ceremony that aired on abc . i have once stationed tenure when do as i 've marine corps .
15944,"yeah , i bet to la during the one hosted by jimmy kimmel at thas dolly theatre . i think it 's important for people with a voice to make change to use whatever platform they can to get a positive message out there ."
15945,hey my friend did you see the movie black panther yet ?
15946,i have and it was by far one of the best comic book movies of 2018 ! ryan coogler did a wonderful job directing it !
15947,ya and chadwick boseman did a great job with the character r ! i guess black panther is technically the richest carter in them marvel universe too
15948,poes n't he have a networth of roughly 500 billion ? crazy to think tat as most people i 'm sure would guess either bruce wayne is tony stark was the richest !
15949,"yup , tony stark ' only ' haha 100 billion and bruce wayne has 0 billion too"
15950,"that 's crazy ! just think though , boseman could n't initially afford to attend a summer theater program at oxford until denzel ; stepped in and funded it privately ."

16036,i dunno . if they did something like that in the 80s i 'd figure they 'd b all over expanding heir ' rand ' today . they were a lot less horrible then ?
16037,"that is a good point . speaking of clothing , did you know pilgrims actually wore colorful clothing"
16038,"i remember reading that . they also breed beer . i think a lot of stuff identified with puritanism teetotaling , etc . actually started a lot later with wesleyanism andc he second great awakening ."

16045,"for sure , they get to dress in epa panda to work with pandas , i would do it for a yea ri think lol"

16056,"daniel daylewis is a grea actor i agree , i also like decaprio , weird how eminem ha sworn more oscars than him , jonn depp and others combined"
16057,"neat is pretty crazy , he does n't have more than walt densely though ! he holds the record for the moms oscars won by a man with 22 under is name ."

16060,"no not really , did blazing saddles ever win ? i didnt know an award could be nominated for another award"

16062,"yeah 9 emmys , how does that happen ! ! so do you like to wear costumes ?"
16063,"i do n't usually like wearing them , i kind of wish i was panda researcher so i could wear a panda costume to week everyday ."

16066,"thats amazing , at least itd in get lost forever , uniforms worn by he alliance on firefly are actually old starship troopers uniforms"
16067,"oh wow , that 's pretty neat , i wonder if that helped them save money in the budget ? liu beard that sean bean is so scared of flying stat he hiked into location in full costume when filming lord of the rings ."
16068,"he did ? he must be really scared to wear that costume all the way up , sean bean is a great actor"
16069,he is a really good actor . did you know that pilgrim clothing was full of color ? they only wore black fo special occasions .
16070,"i always though of pilgrims in a black and white way , i guess we took the black and white uniform out of context ,"
16071,"i guess we did too , because that 's what i 've always thought of aws well . i you know tha apple ha da clothing line in 1986 ?"
16072,"no i didnt , i would buy an apple tshirt , i wonder why thy dont have one anymore"
16073,"i'n ot sure , it would be cool to have though . i heard that rip curl makes clothes in north korea , but the label says made in china . that 's kind of odd ."
16074,"that i shoud , there is a store in alabama that sells clothes from unclaimed luggage"
16075,game you watched the black panther ?
16076,"i have seen all them marvel movies multiple times , you ?"
16077,"no , i actually ahve not seen it yet . i heard that he is actually the richest superhero ."
16078,he is with a estimated 00 billion . i thin marvel did a great job with the black panther story line a well a bringing them all together for the avengers .
16079,"hear , i really should ego check it out . i did n't know that he was n't named after the black panther party"
16080,"to funny , some of the script that you 'll same in the movie are factual ."
16081,i heard that the script is based on an actual ancient script called nsibdi .
16082,that 's right ! it dates back as far as the 4th century .
16083,have you read black panther in comic book form ?
16084,"if i had it was so long ago i could n't tell you . i was more of a superman batman fan , haha ."
16085,do you like marvel or dc comics ?
16086,"both but if i have to choose it ' marvel heads one , for me . you ?"
16087,i guess i like marvel . did you know that they published a general comic book so that they could trademark the names superhero and supervillain ?
16088,did n't know that . i did hear that the first released comic was in 1933 . ?
16089,interesting . i guess comic strip shard been around in newspapers for longer .
16090,yeah i remember family circle and of course the peanut put apparently they were the first .
16091,it is surprising to think that my grandparents may have enjoyed comic books . have you heard of the superhero normalman ?
16092,is n't he the one with no superpowers among a people with superpower s ?
16093,that is him . there are over 300 registered superheroes . i do n't know who they all are but that stilll ness nfl i expected .
16094,how can you be a registered superhero ? that sounds strange to me . men and women firefighters to me are heroes police officers soldiers . . . etc
16095,i think they just mean ttrademarekd superheroes .
16096,"we , get any sun today ?"
16097,"hello there , not too much it is only about 15 degrees outside today , how about yourself ?"
16098,nemo it hasnt ' y risen yet . where ar eyou n the world ?
16099,"i am in the united states , and its going to get much colder . did you know that the sun is actually white ? e everyone perceives it as well though ."
16100,wow i wonde what dogs perceive it as . i just learned tha 'the sun produces enough energy in a second to meet the need of all of planet earth for 500k years
16101,"holy cow , that is an insane amount of energy . i wonder how that is all even calculated ."
16102,i wonder how someone figured that out . here 's another one . a lightning bolt is abou the hotter than the surface of the sun . ouch !
16103,"that is crazy and people get hit by those and somehow survive ! i gues the sun 9s also 330 , 000 times the size of earth as well ."
16104,"hah seems like a giant , but apparently the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star that has been discovered thus far in our galaxy"
16105,"yeah when you put it that way , it makes you feel even smaller lol . on a different note , do you like horses much ?"
16106,i 'm fine with them . i actually saw and pitted one yesterday whirl erin a outdoor shopping all . how about you ?
16107,"neat 's pretty cool , i have n't been near a horse for years . did you know that dalmatians are thought to calm horses ?"
16108,no i did n't . i bet hidlago 's favorite movie was 101 dalmations .
16109,"yeah i bet you are right . i also heard that some high school students got suspended when they rode some horses to school on 'no vehicles to school day ' , i though that was pretty lame ."
16110,"treat 's funny ? . i would just skip school . speaking of movies though , clinton eastwood had a midlife allergy to horses even though he killed 3 me his one of his westerns for laughing at phish morse ."
16111,"yeah that is a strange fact , i know he was in plenty of westerns and was around lots of them . and taht is crazy !"
16112,"did you hear about the horse that people thought was a genius because he could do math , but really he was just dreadign the subconscious expressions of his owner to figure she answer ?"
16113,"no i never heard that , like you mean the owner was just tracking everyone ?"
16114,"no , the situation was the horse would be asked a question ad then tap his horses on the ground to communicate . and his owner would just make expressions subconsciously when the correct answer came about dainty he horse would pick up on it and stop tapping ."
16115,"oh now i understand , thanks . that is pretty funny to say the least . i have an am that stir , l shows horses for competitions ."
16116,she should teach it how to do calculus and with at it whenever it makes the right answer
16117,"yeah geez , that would make some serious money . well it was nice chatting with you today , i hope you have a good day when it comes !"
16118,"hi there , looking forward to cha twitch you ! ; ,"
16119,hello there ! do you like reading ?
16120,"yes , i love to read , why ?"
16121,do you like non fiction or fiction ?
16122,i prefer fiction . horrors mostly . you ?
16123,i like non fiction when i do read a here 's an interesting book by jack london which tells about when h lived as a homeless person in the poorest sections o london . he did this for several months . this helped to expose the gap between the rich and the poor .
16124,interesting . is that a recent position ? i do n't remeber seeing day in teh bookstore . . .
16125,it is a book from 1903 .
16126,"hmm . . . ok . . . not recent then : , lol you like old positions like that ?"
16127,"i like both modern and old non fiction . interestingly enough h , country singer jimmy buffet is one of eight people to have both a fiction and nonfiction book get to number one on the new york times best seller list . i wonder what they were about ."
16128,"oh , now that 's really cool . ave to look up what was the fictional book about ? or maybe you know ?"
16129,"no , i am not sure what the fictional book was , . apparently george w bush liked ot read non fiction too . he lead 86 historical nonfiction books and 14 biographies of lincoln during his presidency ."
16130,"wow . . . sounds like really foreign lecture : . for me i mean . . . but i guess it was pretty handy for him : ,"
16131,it 's interesting that he liked to read about lincoln . maybe it was more relevant for him since then were both presidents .
16132,"maybe he took some tips from those books ? : ,"
16133,"yes , i wonder if he did . do you like poetry ?"
16134,"i like nick caved 's poetry ; ,"
16135,i do n't really like poetry . stanley clumsy is apparently a great point who decided to turn to narrative nonfiction .
16136,"interesting . i like dark poetry about people 's weaknesses and our demons : ,"
16137,do you write any poetry ? it seems like lots of authors often change their genre as time goes on .
16138,"naah . . . i 'm not good at that , but i like listening t singing poetry : ,"
16139,"ah , that sounds like an interesting kind of poetry ."
16140,"have you , by any chance , ever viewed paintings by turner or xonstabl3 , contemporaries born in 1977 1916 , in museums ?"
16141,"no , but i would be interested to . are they good ?"
16142,yup ; now considered great printers . both painted landscapes . do you like thats the of art ?
16143,landscapes are my favorite style of paintings . are you familiar with stanley clumsy who did nonfiction york of artists ?
16144,"the poet ? he , as bit , his language skills must have illuminated the lives of bout british printers very wall . sublime , m maybe ?"
16145,"perhaps , i believe his writings try to show what makes artist 's work unique and lasting ."
16146,"yes . i feel for poor , old unstable , who could n't seem to sell paintings in his lifetime . seems to be the story of other artists , like van gogh . . ."
16147,it is nice to read about and try to understand the past . did you george w . bush during his time in the white house read 14 biographies of abraham lincoln .
16148,"that pay ? well , there a a lot of lincoln works out there . seem to recall that ' w ' was a historic nonfiction fan , too . how about you ?"
16149,i like reading biographies . ish ave a read a few about do . i think i did this because when i growing i knew adults who were fascinated with him and wondering halt the country would have been liked if he was n't assassinated .
16150,"i get it . do n't honestly know of a really distinctive jfk biography , but i 've got his book , profiles o courage , a nonfiction account of brave individuals i can see , lily recommend . jfk could write well !"
16151,"yes , i read that many years ago . did he write that while recovering rom his world war ii injuries ?"
16152,"right , though he never really recovered . nonfiction writers talker responsibility for truth in the events or people or boo . they present . contrast jfk 's sublime ability to d stat , with our current president ' daily lies and misinformation . . . writers may make better leaders ? ? ?"
16153,perhaps . i think our current president should become a fiction writer .
16154,"well said . maybe ' the art of the deal ' is just that : fiction . are you familiar with the writer , ellen g . white ?"
16155,is she the author who translates nonfiction ?
16156,"actually , i she she is the female nonfiction author who 's the most translated into other languages ."
16157,that is interesting . here 's one you might know : jimmy buffet is only of one of eight people to have both a fiction and nonfiction book reach number 1 on the new york times est seller list
16158,"who would have guessed d ? just goes to show that the ny best seller list does n't always an best written ! i guess nothing beats hte bible for sales and impact , though . great to talk with you . blessings ."
16159,its been good talking to you . sure you do n't want to talk just a bit more ?
16160,"hanks . another time , perhaps . just have to finish a book this weekend ! cher s ! !"
16161,"okay , hopper to talk to you again"
16162,regards .
16163,"hi , do you know much about the sun n ?"
16164,"hey there , i know some stuff , like that it is white and not yellow ."
16165,yeah atmospheric scattering must be really good at playing tricks like that on us .
16166,haha yeah that is true . it makes up almost 00 percent of the mass o 'the solar system
16167,wow that is amazing . and it is so hot hat we only need one second of its energy for 500 000 years
16168,wow that is very little for a lot in return . sunsets on mars are blue
16169,"ohh i would ; ike to see that . a lightning bolt i much hotter than the sun , 5 times to be exact"
16170,that is a lot of energy packed in there . did you know the sun does not rotate as a body ?
16171,mmm o how does that work ?
16172,well the poles rotate slower than the equator .
16173,ohh that ks pretty cool . the sun is still on bilionth of the biggest star in the galaxy
16174,wow that really puts things into perspective . do you by any chance like animals ?
16175,i do . i hae a cat and two dogs . how about you ?
16176,i have a dog only but i also like horses . when they leave iceland they are not allowed to return there
16177,wow i wonder why . do you know why dalmatians are associated with firefighters ?
16178,hmm to be honest ia ve no idea . but speaking o horses . their hair lengths ia related to the amount of sun they get
16179,that is pretty cool and dalmatians are cause they can calm down horses and protect them
16180,wow what a bond they must have then . did you kno horses are ticklish ?
16181,what ? haha that is so funny did not realize they are . clint eastwood had is always on movies with horses is apparently kind of allergic to them
16182,"wow taht is ironic . yeah nad it is not just horses that are ticklish , sharks and orangutans as well"
16183,"wow that is so amazing , i had no idea"
16184,"hi , how are you ? do you like fantasy and fiction ?"
16185,i do ! i hope to read a really interesting sounding ibook by baciglaupi and buckets called ' the tangled lands . ' have you heard of it ?
16186,"no , m i have not . what ia it about ?"
16187,"it 's got to do with living in a fantasy world where thee is magic , bu tit is forbidden . the reason for hte magic ban is pretty interesting , too ."
16188,"magic exists but is banned ? interesting . and if you are caught using magic , what happens ?"
16189,"well , a according to had i 've read , this fantasy world will grow vines that choked out everything and will put you to sleep i pu touch them ."
16190,"hm , well that 's no good . i guess i should refrain from using magic . nobody uses it then ? that 's a shame ."
16191,there 's a kind of scientist in the storyline that tries to combat the gamble vines . i wonder if he is ever successful ?
16192,a scientist ? interesting . and sufficient advanced technology is idnistinguishable from magic .
16193,"the book also has some type of mad spirit t , too . i wonder how the scientist would explain it adn if h tries to stop it like the vines ?"
16194,"well , i guess the only way to find out is to read the book ! , ol what other fiction do you like ?"
16195,i read all of the black station fiction books as a kid . i had a lot o books i liked but really ca n't remember them all ! twitch fiction books do you ie ?
16196,"wow , that goes back a long way . i haven'tread those books in years . i do n't get much fiction . ususally non fiction . i enjoyed sci fi and fantasy . lotr ."
16197,"i still haven ' read the lotr books , unfortunately . i was waiting to get some type of special collector edition fro a local bookstore hat sells ; ones of classic fiction books . i love the movies , too . great fantasy !"
16198,"yes , the best , really . so many imitators . what about neil mailman ? he 's good too ."
16199,"i have n't , but i am interested to read his stuff . have you read any fictions by james michener ? i loved the book he wrote about hawaii !"
16200,"oh , he wrote a ton of books about different countries and cultures . no i havent ' . i guess i should . what 's his best ?"

16204,"i might have , i do n't remember . he 's right . fear is normal . all emotions exist to help us understand ourselves and the world ."
16205,"it definitely cared me . so did a skit on sesame street , though ! what a fantasy world sesame street is , right ? ! have you hear of the dance you can study fiction nd fantasy lit ?"

16216,"i 'm not huge into fantasy stuff , i 've never done fantasy football . i do n't have enough free time for that , what about you ? ."
16217,"yeah i do n't play fantasy sports , but i do watch fantasy movies like the lord o the rings , the lord of the rings return of the king actually won best picture at the academy awards"
16218,"i saw a few of those , i do n't think i saw the last one of the series , was it any good ?"
16219,"yep thagt was the last one that won the award , i actually like te first one the best but they are all pretty good"

16221,"yeah i do like game of throne i ca n't wait for the new season to come out in april , what about you"

16223,"yep i agree with you . i also like the books that give of thrones is based on , t hey are works of fiction , do you read at all"
16224,"i do , but i tend to read fiction for some reason . right now i 'm reading hunter s . ' hell 's angels ."
16225,i heard that 's a good book . did you hear about the judge winter he fifties tried to ban a comic book because there was a black character in it
16226,"no , what judge was it ?"

16232,cool . i sis age film starring chadwick boseman i saw advertised ?
16233,"yeah chadwick boseman is one of the reading actors , he i she years old but looks a lot younger ."
16234,"probably z vegan like tom brady . meat ages a person faster , although living without meat makes meantime drag , so maybe it is an illusion . in any event , glad boseman made the cut . he played the role in captain america : civil war . i at it when actors swap characters ."
16235,"i know i wouldnt to be a it live without meat lol , i just look it too much b , and he did ? what role did eh play in captain america ? he was black panther in that film as wel alright ?"
16236,"yup . it 's nice to see a marvel film with a phd , instantly black cast . a great actor can pals any role , but you ca n't take skin color . no need o when there are so many good actors of every color or race l"
16237,"i agree with you and also dang uirira and lupita antonio , they also had a great performance in the movie"
16238,"nice . i may have to watch it on netflix today . you know the script for the movie is based on a nigeria script dating back to hte 4th century ? not that i 'm that old , but i appreciate continuity !"
16239,"i didn snow thaat ! that is an interesting fact an doyou should watch it for sure , black panther is a movie thats celebrated as a shift for a more positive thinking attitude in africa , its a movie thats makings history so you wouldnt want to miss hat ."
16240,"yeah , maybe i 'll invite some friends over to watch and cell have a back panther party . of course , it will have nothing to do with the political group , just like the movie i unrelated to the top , critical group . i could remade it a black leopard party , but it does not have the same poetic ring to it ."
16241,"and people wont understand if you call it like that ol , you know black panther is considered the richest hero , mine than stark and batman combined , thats crazy !"
16242,"poor tony take . i feel for the poor rich guy . . . not . hey , did you know denzel washington had a hand in chadwick boseman 's reset o female ?"
16243,"i didnt know that , how did denzel contribute to his rise to fame ?"
16244,"as i understand it , denzel paid for chadwick to attend a prestigious summer theater program in oxford 20 years ago . denzel is a classy act ! if you have not seen his youtube inspirational speeches , you should check them out ! so , 20 ears later , chadwick gets to thank denzel for it during the premiere ! awesome story !"
16245,"that is a great thing to do , chadwick is going to be in his day forever , you know that marvel created a hero for a kid that had to wear hearing aids but felt bad about it m , its called blue ear ."
16246,"news to me ! if it gets made into a film , i hope i tides not flop at the box office like disney 's treasure planet !"
16247,"i think i would be a successful movie , i bet that kid will watch it for sure so thats one viewer , sony had the chance to buy the cinematic lights toa lost every marvel hero but only bought the rights of spiderman"
16248,"studios are known to be risk adverse . they have been burned too many times . like the movie , trojan ar , tat shelled out 15 mil for production and earned only top at the box office . how does taht happen ? i could make more with a snowing in my garage . . ."
16249,maybe it didnt have a good advertisement and was a terrible movie with a lame plot .
16250,black father is an american superhero film based marvel comics character .
16251,yes . the disney smash hit grossed over 1 million over the weekend !
16252,"black father ahs descended so fast at 'the box offic a it has the biggest opening few for a standalone film , it created a biggest box of office in opening hoe day history all over the world ."

16257,yes . the richest superhero is the black panther .
16258,"yes , tony stark and bruce wayne is also the richest to r ."
16259,yes ! the symbols nd written script feature din black father a based on an actual script called nsibdi .
16260,"marvel comic sis she brand named and primary in publication of the comics book . later then , they are moved to movies also ."
16261,"yes ! i had so , e of the marvel comics when i was a kid . black panther was almost changed o black leopard in order to avoid confusion with the controversial group ."
16262,"marvel comics create superhero , blue ear , just for a 4 year od boy who was uncomfortable wearing hearing adds it really very amazing ."
16263,that is amazing ! the silence of the lambs came out on valentines day in 1991 and had a lot offic of over 270 million n !
16264,why is your favourite superhero character ?
16265,"if i had to pick one , i would like iron a . did you know that disneys creature planet was one of the most expensive box office flops ot all time ?"
16266,yeah . disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure .
16267,i ca n't believe that they would consider shutting that drown . do yu like tom hanks ?
16268,yes . he is the highest all time box office star .
16269,yes ! his movies have made over 7 . 5 billion dollars at the box office ! i have un chatting with you !
16270,very nice chatting with you . have a great day ?
16271,you have a great day too
16272,do you like marvel movies ?
16273,i am not really a fan of those movies but i am familiar and have read a lot of information about them
16274,black panther grossed over 200 million in teh first four days of its release .
16275,wow that is a lot for the first days of release
16276,you should really ty to watch it . i think that all marvel movies are awesome ! do you know who the main characters are ?
16277,"i am familiar with the lead , blank panther character , but i havent gone in depth wit them . speaking of characters did you know here is one character crowned by both marvel and dc , named access , whose sole ; purpose is to try to keep both companies ' universes separate ."
16278,i didnt know that . i was however surprised gwen disney bought marvel .
16279,"i a minor surprised . its a big money maker , disney does not own the rights o show ' big ' marvel characters , avengers , xmen , spiderman , etc , in theme parks east of the mississippi , due to a contract marvel signed with niversla studios in the 90s"
16280,"that 's right the salt dissent company only acquired marvel entertajnmnet , marvel worldwide 's parent company . marvel started in 1991 9am timely publications , end by the early 1900s , had generally become known as atlas comics ."
16281,"in 1998 , marvel offered the cinematic rights of almost all of its characters to sony for a few it million . sony rejected the offer , and not purchased the rights to spiderman for 10 million believing that movie audiences would only care about him . . . imagine missing the opportunity to buy the rights or so cheap"
16282,i know they are really kicking themselves about taht . many people are using the movie to celebrate a shift towards a more positive empowering portrayal of people from africa
16283,"yep . dd you know that the writing and symbols in black panther werent just made up , the are based on a script called nsibdi , goin back to the 4th centry from present day nigeria"
16284,yeah symbolism is everywhere . personally i think the villain plated by michael b anthony stolen hes how . hi same in the film was killmogner .
16285,i have herd a lot of people say that exact same thing . maybe i should watch have movie to see for myself
16286,"you want be disappointed . did you know that the black panther is the richest super hero , worth 500 billion ."
16287,i did know that . that i swore money than tony stark an bruce wayne
16288,i think its pretty funny that they had to go to court arguing that mutants ar knot human .
16289,yeah . . but in the en it toy got a cheaper price on items since it is a toy and not human
16290,yeah i guess thats the bottom line .
16291,"yes . these industries live by the same rule wutang clan dope , c . r . e . a . m . cash rules everything around me"
16292,"indeed ! i did think it was sentimental that they created a superhero what a hearing impairment . his name was blue ear , have you heard of im ?"
16293,i read something bout him . was made to help a kid who did n't like the idea of hearing aids
16294,did you kow marvel o ton play a lower rate on toys because they said mutants ace n't people ?
16295,i did not know that ! hard you a comics fan ? did you know that black panther is one of the top grossing movies ever ?
16296,i heard that it was ! have you seen it ? i have n't even watched it yet .
16297,"i have not . i have seen a couple of the comic movies , this one se records for having ah huge opening by a black director ."
16298,"the black panther risk supposedly worth 500 billion a that 's more than apple , i think !"
16299,i wonder where he got his money ? i did real that his name balck panther has nothing to do with the black panthers from the '60s .
16300,"i saw that it is from something called nsibdi , which goes back to the 4th century in nigeria . it 's more likely the party was named after him ."
16301,did you kno wthe marvel comics silo the screen rights of its characters for 25 million to sony ? sony turned they down and ordered 10 million only forms spiderman ? they thought hat was the only character people would b interested in .
16302,do you think it 's because sony only wanted to create video games from the movies ? i have to admit that i like the spider man movies the most . the whole eli situation with ironman i find a little creepy .
16303,i did enjoy spiderman but some of the avengers are getting difficult to keep up with ! i ca n't believe that disney owns the rights to produce the movies but cant ' use it in there parks . i know universal theme park has the spiderman ride .
16304,"wow ! i did n't know universal had a spiderman made . i knew that disney owned the star wars franchise , now , gut marvel ."
16305,"on another note , did you know that tom hanks is the highest all time box office star ?"
16306,i think i heard that h was . what movie did he make the most tone on ?
16307,"o am not sure , but i would gues it was the lion one about the vatican scandal . can you believe the silence of the lamb came ut on valentines day ?"
16308,no . i did n't remember when hte movie came out . i know that i was in college because i wanted to be a prosecutor until i saw tht movie .
16309,yikes ! disney 's biggest flop was treasure planet . i have never heard of it !
16310,"i have heard of it , bu ti always get it confused with the puppets treasure island ."
16311,haha ! i do remember hearing that denzel washington ad supported an actor through collie . i read that it was chadwick boseman who got to thank him as the black panther premiere .
16312,"that was super nice of denzel washington . of course to dense , that money was probably pocket change . now , chadwick boseman will have enough money to support someone else after playing the black panther ."
16313,i like the truly kindness in people . did you know that the superhero creators made blue ear to make a boy feel better about wearing hearing aids ?
16314,"no , i did n't , but i love that idea ! hope you hav epa goood night !"
16315,hi . do you like science fiction
16316,"i do enjoy science fiction quite a bit , as well as al sorts of fiction . it certainly says something that lord of the rings won the only academy award for best picture for a fantasy fil , ."
16317,"by the way , do you ant to be a scientist"
16318,"no , i think that science is interesting but not something i want to study with my life 's energy . i do find it shocking the ear that we have reached the point of storing gif images onto the dna o bacteria !"
16319,"did you know that akihito , the emperor of japan is a scientist"
16320,"no , that 's amazing to i love to learn about people in various roles who ace secretly scientists , such as matt patricia who is a cool for the nfl but also a rocket scientist ."
16321,he does not look like a scientist to me
16322,rye coach 100 the japanese emperor ? i think it 's important to note that being a scientists poes not automatically make someone ' bright . '
16323,i concur . being knowledgable in one thing dogs not guarantee in the others
16324,"exactly , although it does seem like older scientists such aa william wheels from 1833 , were more fancy and legitimate the some of the people today ."
16325,did you know harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon
16326,"no , i had never heard of him only the classics like armstrong canda adrian ! it 's no wonder though since the scientists are phd domes who do all of the hard work . in fact much of our culture and modern knowledge stems from the early form of science which was called natural philosophy ."
16327,i thought that there should be a lot more of hem walking on the moon already
16328,"i guess it get complicated when scene is so wrapped up in every industry such asu government , academies , nonprofits and most importantly the economy . they must not be able to afford it ."
16329,i was surprised that the world wide web was invented in 1998 . i though it was way before ethan
16330,it is a bit nerve inducing though we you think about the plots o shows like ' black mirror '
16331,i have never watched that show . what was it about
16332,it is an anthology series that features various horror plots bout the modern technology and other things like that .
16333,"ohh , is . . i am going to watch it if i have time"
16334,"i haven ' watched it much though yet , i find all of this techno so creepy especially the storing dat pain dna bit !"
16335,"happy ho , bday"
16336,you too
16337,bye
16338,to you like watching the marvel comic movies ?
16339,i do ! they are some of my favorites how about you ?
16340,"i love them , black panther was one of my favorite . so much awesomeness in that film , did you like it ?"
16341,"i loved it ! i did n't realize though that the character was n't actually named after the black panther party . i always thought it might be collected , but apparently the super hero predates the party ."
16342,"me too , i did not know that either , it would make one because of the black put . he is also the richest superhero at 500 billion dollars"
16343,i read that too ! that 's crazy . did you know disney does n't own any rights to use bing marvel characters eas tofu the mississippi ? i 've always wondered why they never had any marvel things at disneyland i guess thats why !
16344,"that is interesting ! i did not know had , i hae only been to florida . who is your favorite marvel character ?"
16345,"spiderman for sure ! did you know thats an got offered the rights o all marvel characters in 1998 , but rejected it and purchased spiderman only because they did n't think people would care about the others ?"
16346,"nice a love me some spiderman ! i heard stan lee created iron man because he did n't think anyone would like him . speaking of disney before , did you hear about their biggest box office flop ?"
16347,"really ? its hard to imagine anyone not liking iron man . and no , i did n't hear what was it ?"
16348,"it was treasure planet , they spent 1000000 on it and made only 309 dollars ! i ca n't believe ha to be true !"
16349,oh my gosh i 've never even hear do that ! 309 is nothing !
16350,right ! i wan too watch it to see how bad it really was ? i wonder if they pulled it out of embarrassment and mabye people being fired
16351,for real ! i want to see it too ! did you know sleeping beauty was a box office failure too ?
16352,"i did not know tha t , i did hear one movie jaded disney almost shut down their animation studios , must have been that"
16353,yeah that was it ! crazy to think disney animation could have ended that soon so many good movies would never have been made !
16354,"for sure , i love frozen and moana . frozen was teh first movie directed by a woman for disney"
16355,i love about of those too ! i did n't know frozen was directer by a female really cool ! was moana as well ?
16356,"i am not sure , but it was a box office hit ! good chatting with you !"
16357,good chatting with you as well !
16358,bye !
16359,"hi , how are you ?"
16360,"pretty good thanks for asking , pu ?"
16361,i 'm groovy . did you know that the emperor of japan i a scientist ? liu guess he as tim among hi other official duties .
16362,yeah ish had he still to this day publishers papers
16363,"sometimes i wonder what these scientists are getting up to . harvard scientists stored a gif animation of a galloping horse in the dna of bacteria . um , what about a cure for cancer ?"
16364,no money in that ! ! i feel the same way . the term scientist didnt even becomes of regular use until teh 19th century .
16365,"teh web was invented pretty recently , in 1989 , by a scientist working in switzerland for the cern . tim borders lee . the guy is a legend l but probably brought human productivity iin the work place to a standstill ."
16366,ow i did not know the . however was it funded by a europeanstate ?
16367,"yeah , cern is in europe . it 's a big research facility . did you know that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character ? i ca n't imagine that happening in europe ."
16368,yeah unfortunately some ppl are mean and hateful . did you know that fantasy congress is a real thing
16369,"people will wager on anything . it 's goo duo take na interest in politics but i do n't think those people that do fantasy congress card about realworld implications , just whether they win ."
16370,yeh your rights ! julius caesar route fantasy .
16371,"he had an active imagination , which probably helped him s a general ."
16372,probably ! did you know tha edgar flesh poe wrote the first known example of what we would call a cyborg .
16373,the guy was certainly macabre ! great imagination . but married a 13 yo if i recall correctly .
16374,yeah he was relaly interesting
16375,but left an entertaining legacy for us ! i agree with george rr martin about fan fiction . t 'd usually awful .
16376,harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon
16377,i chess you need to be in great shape to go to the moon . so there will be commercial travel to them one and every old lady with a dog will be going .
16378,funny ! but if old newt gingrich gets hes way will ave a colony there soon .
16379,"well , i enjoyed chatting !"
16380,did you know that there is a fantasy draft for the national spelling bee ?
16381,taht is crazy ! i wonder how t workers ?
16382,"me too . you know there was a janitor in chicago that wrote 15 , 145 pages over 6 years . wow !"
16383,that is crazy . it is unfortunate that is was discovered after his death . it would have been nice if he was alive .
16384,yes one can hope right ! it was a fantasy manuscript to over 300 watercolor illustrations . do you remember that it was called ?
16385,it was called ' in the realms of the unreal ' . creative name .
16386,yeah real catchy time right . makes me want to open it up . apparently theme as a guy that got knighted for his service to literature . you know him ?
16387,was it the comedic fantasy author terry pratchett ?
16388,it was good to him i wonder what it 's like to be knighted ? did you know a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy ?
16389,that is crazy ! i would think it would be more than just a fold !
16390,"yeah me too , lets us know how close we are to insanity . lol ! do you like fiction ?"
16391,some fiction . have yu ever use wiki to see the ranks for fictional characters ?
16392,i did not know they even did that i 'll have to check it out . what do they rank them by i wonder .
16393,they rank according to their powers and abilities .
16394,"oh ok that makes sense , lol . di you know that caesar wrote fan fiction ?"
16395,he write an fiction about hercules and oedipus in his youth !
16396,yeah that sounds cool . you know edgar allen poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction ?
16397,i did not know that ! the ravens football team is after his works .
16398,to funny ! fiction refers o any narrative that is drive from the imagination .
16399,"further , it is not based strictly on history or fact ."
16400,and can also refer more narrow to narratives written only in prose .
16401,i high go to the library and find some fiction books . have a nice day .
16402,i thought the black panther movie was generic nad not that good
16403,i respect that opinion . i personally thought the movie was very well made and introduced many interestin characters . earning 23 50million at the box office is quite a feat .
16404,"that is impressive , i think this whole things about the strong feminist characters is very ovebrlo2n , i thought females portrayed in movies like terminator 2 and alien are more realistic , they are women that are bad ass but in a realistic way"
16405,i did enjoy both terminator 2 and she lines movies . i think that we need to have women who are bad ass in all areas . adding goin a general and spy to those ranks is good for women . what did you think of the idea of having an all female protection squad ike the dorm mileage ?
16406,"ya i mean that is fine . it says in this article tat their sex appeal is obvious but secondary to their personality an still . they did n't have a personality in my opinion , i guess they have kill but i find it very unrealistic that they are killing people who have guns with like swords and sears"
16407,i think that requires a suspension of belief which it sounds like did n't quite cross the gap for you . the comics go much more into detail of my wakanda 's weapons are swords and sears as you put it but that is quite a bit for a movie to explain until ridley 's weapons in the aliens obvious or terminator weapons . even though i di enjoy the move get did n't think it was more than a weekend activity .
16408,"well i appreciate your honestly and i ? m not judging you for your opinion , i 'm reading through and it says that black panther is actually ther richest marvel superhero , even more han tony star , which i did n't know"
16409,"that i true , although to be frank that 's like comparing spiderman , tony stark , to batman , back panther , which is not really fair . tiny developed wall his own technology nd black panthers ad a lot of he ; lp dnc inherited his wealth though his country . i did like ethan dorothy steel wasa the to make her acting debut as the old woman in black panther . sometimes people get a dream late ."
16410,"ya that is nice , and he would be rich than even tom hank 's entire box office draw at 8 . 5 million , much is a ton , also that is so weird that silence of the lambs came out on valentines day"
16411,"what a creepy valentine 's day debut ! yeah , tony stark is my favorite avengers to i like seeing how fast his character has come to far . i hope he mentor slack panther as the rest of the avengers but that avengers : endgame does n't look like he will get the chance . i wonder if marvel will ever show the blue ear superhero in the avengers ."
16412,"ah i have n't heard of the blue ar , i do think its funny that marvel tried to sell sony all their properties in 98 but theyre refused , nad now marvel is making so much money as sony 's superhero movies are pretty terrible , in my opinion"
16413,"yah , blue ear was a character created for a year old child who was uncomfortable wearing hearing aids . i did not know marvel tried to sell tos one . that 's so funny when you think about if now . did you know michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics in the 1990s ?"
16414,"nope i dd n't know that either , i wonder how much hr offered , i know they ware in bad shape for some part pf the 90 's , it 's hood that they 're back on track now"
16415,"yeah , it is good they are back on track . if we look back though you can find may movie in the past did very well . no at the originals to wars movies which if we adjusted for inflation would have made 1 . 3 billion at the box office ."
16416,"ya that is crazy , not 's also wild that walt disney owns marvel and the star wars movies , they really have exploded and its funny that were thinking about closing theirs doors when sleeping beauty was a oz office failure"
16417,it is wild that call dissent has acquired ll these properties . not only sleeping beauty was a box office failure but other movies like john carter nd children of men which when we look back in time both were considered failure but children of men lost 8 million at the box office .
16418,"o wow i did n't know children of men only made that much , i actually like that movie a lot , i did remember disney 's treasure plane movie , that was a huge bomb , i saw it rexenlty its ok but i can zee why it was n't successful"
16419,"yeah , t 's sad that children of men lost that much money but ironic that mortal kombat 2 was the first video game to make more than hollywood box office sales before call of duty . however there are more losses which were actually wins as well like lord of the rings which had major losses despite bring a huge box office success ."
16420,"ya that iss surprising , have you seen the movie trojan nwas ? budget of 15 million and made only 309 ? stats hilarious i ? 'm gon na look it up now"
16421,i have not seen trojan wars but i will check it outs sometime . thanks for chat and remember you cabin loss more money than marvel ; or the fantastic four movies .
16422,haha thank nice talojngw with you
16423,have you seen black panther film ?
16424,"i did . i saw it was just no , inflated for several oscars including best picture . did you know that he is the richest superhero ?"
16425,yes . i know a little bt . i think ' b ; hack panther ' stars share reallife inspirations .
16426,"i was not aware of that . taht makes for nice relationships on set . back panther the character is estimated to be worth 500 billion . to compare , tony stark has 100 billion ."
16427,do you like chadwick boseman ?
16428,black panther is the only movie i 've never seen him in . he did a good job in that movie .
16429,he i kknow nor his ; portrayal of t'challa .
16430,yes fact is the only role i 've ever seen him in . daanir luria was in it and i had seen hr in the making dead so she was the one i was most familiar with .
16431,have top know the details of box office ?
16432,i know some facts about box offices returns . like tom hanks is he highest box office star .
16433,"yes , he is an american actor and filmmakers . hanks is known for his comedic and dramatic roles in such films as splash , big , turner and hatch"
16434,yes he has had lots of pets . later he had movies like saving private ryan shih is amazing . did you know that sleeping beauty was a box office failure ? that surprises me but it 's not always the best indication of success because i know several bombs that became hits later .
16435,"i think , but saw the potential to sell guests a this groundrbeakin theme park on his upcoming film and renamed it sleeping beauty castle before its grand opening ."
16436,he certainly made a good business decision here . i can ' y believe that they owned the silence of the lambs on valentine 's day ! it worked out for them though because they are 270 in box office returns .
16437,"yes , disney also has some of the biggest box office flops of all time ."
16438,"that 's very surprising to me . they seem to be doing just fine though . speaking of since disney just acquired marvel , do you enjoy marvel ?"
16439,"yes , i like it . marvel comics group , a publisher of african comic books and related media ."
16440,i like a lot of their properties and movies . i did not now that there is a character named access that is owned by both marvel and dc . they safe such strong competitors that it surprises e .
16441,me als like theirs defies . that 's interesting .
16442,but marvel is a savvy business so i 'm sure it benefited them somehow . did you know that they had to pay less for their toys because cold ; s are more expensive and they won an argument in court by saying that xmen are mutants and not people so they ca n't be dolls ?
16443,sorry i do not know about this . do you know that details ?
16444,basically they argued in court tha women characters were mutants and not people so they paid less to distribute the toys because they were then classified a stock instead of dolls and dolls cost more .
16445,did you happen to see the black panther movie e ?
16446,"yes , i rented he movie from my cable company ."
16447,"i did not see it yet , but i want to eventually ."
16448,you definitely should d ! it didd were well and was well received by most people .
16449,"i heard it had the 5th biggest opening ever , that is very impressive ."
16450,i 've . i love the avengers series . i try to see as many of them as i can . o you enjoy them as well ?
16451,i have n't seen any of the avengers movies actually . i did read that avengers ; ache o ultron had a huge box office total as well .
16452,"do , but i 'm not sure of the future of th tseries since disney bought the company ."
16453,i heard that as well . are you a marvel comics fan in general ?
16454,i would consider myself one yes . especially since i read they made a super hero with a hearing aid just becaue a boy was uncomfortable with how own .
16455,i used to like reading the comics when i was younger . i hard that in 1998 marvel offered allot he movie rights to almost tall the characters to sony and they rejected .
16456,"well that is goo news for disney ! they are doing well it seems , since star wars out banged prequels by 1 . 3 billion . i et disney will do well with these upcoming movies ."
16457,"yeah i think buying the star wars rights was a brilliant move , taht should pay off for years to come ."
16458,it is hard to believe lack panther made 1924 million dollars n just one weekend tough . very impressive for a movie they were unsure would b popular .
16459,"yeah i agree , and i think they will make a bunch more black panther movies and there similar ."
16460,"it 's hard to say if they will do as well , though . i think a lot of hte success has to be because of coogler . creed was also a great movie that did very well ."
16461,"yeah i agree again , coogler was a huge part of he success it ahs seen ."
16462,ca n't really give all the credit to one person thought . the main actor michel jordan was a great choice for the role .
16463,yeah i think he is a reall good actor . i enjoyed creed much more than i was participating .
16464,do you go to the box office to buy your tickets or do you usually buy them online or home other source ?
16465,"i usually buy them online , so i can pick my seat and know that i have a ticket ."
16466,"my local theaters are usually not very busy , so i just buy them at the box office ."
16467,i can understand that the . it was nice chatting with you today .
16468,i was nice chattin with you as well . take care .
16469,"yep , have a good night ."
16470,you too !
16471,hi ! are you a fan of superheroes ?
16472,i dont really follow comics and superheroes much . you ?
16473,not much really . lol i 've been reading about them is morning . theresa re over 300 registered superheroes in the united states .
16474,how does one register a superhero ? to would like to have my own superhero .
16475,i have no idea ! i think you can register anything that you create . there was a garfield book series spinoff named pt force which featured garfield and his gang as superheroes . lol
16476,that probably was funnier than than regular garfield . why was that comic even started ? i never liked it .
16477,lol i have no idea . there was a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes .
16478,what a job . cleaning ups the mess of heroes . a thankless jo if i wonder how much it paid .
16479,"probably not much . marvel comics creator stan lee wrote 15 dc comics , reimagining popular superheroes like batman and spiderman . they were squeezing all the cash they coul do of them even back in the day . lol"
16480,i wonder why stan was working for d . i guess they paid him a ton .
16481,probably . what do you do when you an out of new ideas to superheroes ?
16482,"um , i guess you shire a team of monkeys l , stick them in front of typewriters , and have hem work for a hundred years ?"
16483,lol close . . . you create a ne superhero called ' normalman ' and you make him the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes ! lol
16484,"opposite world ? that sounds like a weird place . nor , salman is anything but normal on that planet ."
16485,lol disney does not own the rights to show big marvel characters in htek3e parks east of the mississippi due to a contract marvel signed with universal studios in the 90s . interesting .
16486,"disney seems tp be buying money and more . they have marvel , star wars . i the future , it will all be disney ."
16487,you 're not kidding there . marvel comics created a superhero called blue ear just for a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing heroic aids which he needed . the best old his mom tha superheroes don ' tower hearing aids so marvel then created the character .
16488,that is really cool of marvel . i bet the kid was stocked to see that
16489,i bet he was . good to see a feel good story like got . it 's been fin chatting with you ! i learned a lot about superheroes and comics ! lol
16490,"yes , i enjoyed getting too ! have a good day !"
16491,you have a goo dday as well !
16492,"hello there , are you a comic cook van ?"
16493,"i 'm not very into reading them , but i 'm a sucker for any marvel or dc comics movie !"
16494,"i havent ' seen to many of the films , but i used to read yet comics and watch xmen a lot ."
16495,ah . so do did n't see blank panther ? it wa awesome .
16496,no i did n't see that one but hear it was really good .
16497,"yeah , i did n't know black panther is technically the riches superhero . tony stark is second , but way far off than bp ."
16498,"that is crazy , i never knew there was one that had more money than those wo ."
16499,"yeah , apparently black panther is estimated to be worth around 500 billion , while tony stark is only 100 milllion . bruce wayne networth isp 0 billion . i guess it cakes sense , balck panther is like , the king of a whole country ."
16500,"i will have to see the movie , it will most likely make more sense then ."
16501,"it 's basically about a king who became king when his father dies , then another guy challenge the legitimate o his sovereignty and hey duke it out ."
16502,"that is interesting , i head they used historical symbols in the movie as well ."
16503,"yeah , some symbols from as early as the 4th century ."
16504,"wow , that is very cool , i love it heat hey use historical stuff in movies ."
16505,"apparently , the name for black panther predates the political you . that 's weird ."
16506,"that is weird , i think they briefly change the name to avoid being confused with the party ."
16507,"yeah , it can see how that would be al little controversial . they also had an issue with an indian translation because one of the character 's sayings because kid was a villain praising a hind go d ."
16508,"that is true , i think they made changes as to not offend anyone and it backfired ?"
16509,"did you know the creator of marvel , stan lee , envisioned several dc comics characters ? that would e neat to see ."
16510,"no i did n't , yeah hat would be very cool to see what he had u his sleeve ."
16511,"yeah , i wonder what batman or superman would be in a marvelstyle world . way more colorful and humorous !"
16512,"right , well we can wonder . it 's been good talking with you today , i hope you have a good one !"
16513,did you watch the black panther movie ?
16514,"i did , i saw it in theaters last yea rand even it . did you ?"
16515,"i loved it as well , chadwick boseman is a great actor , i love is role on the movie"
16516,"yea he was great as tvhala , but michael b jordan was even better . his performance a killmonger was amazing"
16517,"i agree , how role in the movie was great , you know that . the comics he is the richest superhero"
16518,"i do n't doubt it , he is a girl , man from a raw material rich nation . though i 'm kind of surprised he has more thank tony stark"
16519,yeah more than star and batman combined 2 times
16520,wow ; did you know why actually turned down al ; l of these film rights back in the day when they only cost a measly 25 million ? they only wanted spidey
16521,"i bet they are regretting that decision now since each two is worth like a hundred times more that value , spiderman is my favorite hero though"
16522,"he 's definitely up there for me . back then though i bet no one had any idea lab of these gross would be so huge . really only xmen , fantastic 4 , adn spiderman were threw sell known marvel properties , which were all snatched up"
16523,do you have a favorite marvel hero ? mine is on stark he is a badass
16524,"i like a lot of them but my favorites right e spiderman or wolverine . everyone is pretty awesome though . i was hugh jackman was n't done with ther ole , he wa perfect for it"
16525,"i agree and it would be the to watch a deadpool vs wolverine movie , it would be awesome ! like one of te highest box office movies of all time"
16526,"seriously , with how popular deadpool lisa nd how much publicity their ' feud ' is getting lately . maybe this is all some sort of grand marketing scheme ?"
16527,"it could be , there are a lot of hints in the deadpool movies about a merge including both"
16528,that would he awsome to see . did you know stan lee has actually written 15 comics for dc ? he 's not just a marvel guy
16529,"that 's amazing , i have to read those , there ' e is a hero called blue ear , the story behind his creation ia an interesting on"
16530,"is it ? i 've never heard od him before , tell me about it"
16531,"ok so blu real is a hero created fo nra 4 year old boy who felt insecure about his hearing aid devices , so marvel created the hero to help him and his mom"
16532,oh that 's so nice of them ! making all kids feel like they can be w hero too
16533,"i know right , helping a kid like that , an admirable thing to do , i wish more companies followed that example , robert downey jr also cheers pc children with special conditions ."
16534,hi how are you ?
16535,i 'm great thanks . did you see the movie black panther ?
16536,i did bit i fell asleep through most od it . id you ?
16537,i have not seen it yet . the richest superhero is black panther . did you know that ?
16538,i did ! he has an estimated 500 billion dollars !
16539,that 's crazy ! the symbols in black panther are based on an actual script called nsibdi .
16540,nsibdi dated back to the 4th century and is indigenous to present day nigeria !
16541,that 's pretty old then . black panther was actually not named after the black panther party .
16542,makes sense ! he is worth more than tony stark and bruce wayne combined !
16543,that 's insane . do you like marvel ?
16544,8 do ! did you know disney does not want he rights to show big marvel characters int hee park best of the mississippi ?
16545,i did not know that . that 's all interesting .
16546,it was due to a contract marvel highend with universal in the 90s .
16547,interesting . there is one character owned by both marvel adn dc to 's name is access .
16548,i heard his only purpose is to try and keep ; both companies universes separate .
16549,that 's odd . did you kmnow there was a comics series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes ?
16550,"i did not . probaby , y a good idea since they cause so much damage ."
16551,i agree . there are over 300 registered superheroes in hte united states .
16552,that is so many . i uncle actually was friends with stan lee who wrote 15 dc comics .
16553,that 's pretty awesome ! i ca n't believe he passed away recently . he lived a long life thoug hp filled wit lots of fun and adventure .
16554,yesh e definitely lived a good life .

16559,black paths is supper to be the richest superhero . does it show in the movie ?
16560,"it does , he is basically the king of wakanda , theres a lot of cool tech in the movie"
16561,"so , is it like batman , or what ? black panther has 500 billion vs 80 billion for grace wayne , so he could afford sow pretty nice tech gadgets !"
16562,"yeah kind of , only richer than him nd stark together"
16563,"nice . so , i heard forest whitaker is in this movie . i enjoy hi performance sin other movies . what is his role in this ?"
16564,"im not sure , he is part of th cast but i can recall who he is , th east is great though"
16565,"so , i hear chadwick boseman wish great i this . third is a great backstory to chadwick having some of his education funded by denzel washington , an 'the movie premiere brought them together so he could thank denzel . neat , huh ?"
16566,"i here about that , i think denzel has a great heart , chadwick thanked him over the premiere of the movie"
16567,"denzel ha some awesome inspirational speeches on youtube that you would probably enjoy seeing . i know i did . so , in the movie , was there reference to the nigeria nsibdi script that the story features ?"
16568,"i didnt knw that , but that is really cool sound alike the directors , scripts writer did a great job researching , so are you a fan of marvel comics ?"
16569,"in general , yes , although i ma behind in my watching of movies . . . sounds like you are , am i right ?"
16570,"i am , big fan so i watch them ws they come out , in 2009 disney bought she franchise"
16571,"i thought disney did n't have the right to the characters . is this true ? fantastic for was my favorite growing up , along with spiderman . . . how about you ?"
16572,"i liked iron na and also liked batman , but his from dc comics , you know the actually on a character together"
16573,"yeah . it sounds weird , but i guess it somehow helps them to keep their universes separate . i wonder how it works ?"
16574,i guess that character is not necessary but it works for them .
16575,did you know that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the us ? i wonder if ' normalman ' is one of them ?
16576,"i did n't know that , and he must be , normalman teh hero without any powers ."
16577,did you hear that the richest superhero is actually the black panther at 500 billion ?
16578,"i did n't . that 's amazing , 500 billion dolls is a lot for a superhero to hav a i learned a lot about black panther"
16579,"in 1989 tony as offered cinematic rights to almost all of the marvel characters for only 25 millon and they rejected only purchasing spiderman rights for 10 mi , lion"
16580,"wow ! i learned that michael jackson tried at buy marvel comics in the early 1990 's , so that he could play spiderman . spiderman is definitely a popular superhero ."
16581,that 's interesting . the symbols and written script in back panther are based on actual script called nsibdi from the 4th century
16582,ot is truly interesting how many details go into the marvel universe . black panther was the 4th film i nthe marvel cinematic universe and there are t least 30 superhero movies set to be released between 20162020 .
16583,yes it is . did you hear that black panther was n't named after the black panther party and it name was black leopard for some time
16584,"i did n't ! i actually havent even hack panther , but i want to after learning more . the actor that played black panther actually went to school with money from denzel washington !"
16585,marvel did some censoring of the utterance ' praise hanuman ' due to possible backlash .
16586,"i 'm not sure what that is referring to , bu ti 'll ; cook it it . the actor that plays the villain 's father , n'jobu is from the white television shows his is us . he happens to b emmy favorite character , which makes me want to watch it more ."
16587,marvel was able to successfully argue that mutants are n't people to get to pay lower raves on xmen toys thatd polls because the are not human
16588,that ' bizarre ! marvel also published a generic comic book to trademark the names ' superhero ' and ' supervillain . ' strange indeed .
16589,"surprisingly , disney does n't own rights to show ' ? ' marvel character sin them parks east of she mississippi because of a contract with universal in the 90 's ."
16590,interesting ! the walt disney company did n't even buy marvel until 2009 .
16591,there was a comic series concerning fixing collateral damage caused by superheroes
16592,"that 's always bothered me about the avengers movies . they cause major destruction . thanos mad his debut in the avengers ' infinity war ' that came out on may 4 , 2018 ."
16593,do n't you hate tat the bad guy almost always dies matt he end of the superhero movies ' they are so predictable .
16594,"they really are ! according to what i learned though , some of thye villain or superhero interactions in black panther are different than in other have movies ."
16595,ho war they different ?
16596,"michael b . jordan creates a more dtnmai c , creative villain than seen before . he has even been compared to heath leggero 's joker , which in my opinion , is the greatest superhero villain ."
16597,one character is owned by both marvel and dc named access an his purpose is to keep both companies ' universes separate . i do n't know how that works though .
16598,me either ! good chatting with you . thanks for hte new information . i am going to see if black panther is still on netflix to watch tonight .
16599,sounds good ! there are over 300 registered superheroes so it sounds like he na watch a lot .
16600,"hi , did you ever watch the black panther ?"
16601,"no , b ut i hard it was good ut i 'm not really into th superhero thing in general ."
16602,it is really good . and the character is actually the wealthiest of them all
16603,i heard all scott tweeted that it beat star wars .
16604,i think so too . he symbols used in the movie date back to 4th century
16605,interesting . i heard it invigorated the superhero genre as well a signing over other movies like teh avengers .
16606,yeah that is for sure . did you know chadwick boseman was accepted into a prestigious summer theatre camp at oxford but could not afford to go ?
16607,"until now , i 've never heard the name . i do know that it was things to do with the black panther party ."
16608,yeah he managed to go anyways from a private sponsor who turned out to be denzel washington
16609,i had no idea that comic book characters would be worth so much . the lights tron spiderman want for 10m
16610,i can not believe sony id not but more superhero rights but just spiderman
16611,"yeah , it 's not like they do n't have he bucks . i thought superheroes went back further than the 1930s . i suppose they do if you 've ever end homer ."
16612,yah i am sure they do . do you know who is the charater access ?
16613,no before now . i also id n't know there was one called ' normalman ' a gut hat has no superpowers . i guess i 'm a ' normalman . '
16614,yeah that is strange . access actually does not have powers just keep marvel and dc universes separate
16615,"ish ad n't heard of ' blue ear , ' a superhero marvel created or a 4 year old boy that did n't like wearing his hearing aid . that was nice . . ."
16616,ha was super nice for sure . did you know marvel successfully argued that mutants are a people in court ?
16617,"that 's trange . . . poor bruce wayne . . . hes ' only went 580 and tony stark , 's worth 1909 ."
16618,and not to think of all the collateral damage that superheroes cause
16619,"yeah , i wonder who carries tshirt liability insurance . maybe the coach panther who 's worth 500k ?"
16620,hahha i pet . nice cant .
16621,hello ! did you now there 's a superhero called ' normalman ' ?
16622,"yes , mostly of kids and children are like superhero now days adult and aged people also love this character ."
16623,i guess superhero is a great business ! a lot of people are waiting for the next superhero movie .
16624,the main aim of the superhero to protect the people from thee it and save from the distracted .
16625,one of the biggest companies to make money out of superheroes is marvel . thy even marie money out of toys ! !
16626,"the ar publish the comics books for kids . the walt disney co , and acquired marvel entertainment . it make the children to good and they support to live teh self discipline ."
16627,that makes disney a monster company ! they own most of the market !
16628,", michael jackson tried to . marvel comics in the early 1990 's but it not happened for some reason . otherwise he became the hero of spiderman movie ."
16629,michael jackson made some great deals ! he bought the rights of all the music from the beatles . and that ' a lot money ! !
16630,sure ! the word superhero is commonly used for women also . there are some women superheros .
16631,yes . superhero movie would eb deaf without women superheros !
16632,back panther brings life to marvel ' s greatest superhero . jordan ' sunforgettable performance as 'the classic villian .
16633,seems like he did a good job portraying the villain ! sometimes villains are the best in a movie !
16634,"vile , gains character designed very differently so only people like superhero very much ."
16635,"sadly superheros are not as good a they seem . most of them can not control the rage , are violent , and kill as much people as the villain !"
16636,sure . marvel published comic book in the superhero . it attract the children and also all aged people especially in since 1930s .
16637,"as we were talking before , it 's a great business ! the publish only what they know people are going to like !"
16638,"it develop reading habit among the children . it is biggest change over in the world . mostly reading comics books did nice . ,"
16639,"im surprised that marvel could win a case in court saying their characters karen ot humans , and then to have their taxed reduced !"

16660,"that would be ! there was a co , it series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes ! lol"
16661,o i always wondered about all the damage they caused . sir issac newton was once a sorcerer supreme in the marvel universe !
16662,i never knew that ! did you know that there is a superhero called normalman ? he won the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes !
16663,haha hat would not be a fun movie to see ! ther nwas once something called pet force which featured garfield as a superhero !
16664,nice ! i never knew that . i loved garfield . stan lee wrote 15 dc comics reimagining popular superheroes like batman and superman . i did n't kno that .
16665,"he was such a visionary . there is actually a book called becoming batman , written by a neuroscentist ."
16666,ye she was ! sad he died this past year . it 's been a pleasure chatting with you !
16667,did you see ' black panther ' ?
16668,"no , was it a good movie ? i read it stars michael b . jordan as ' black panther ' and erie killmonger"
16669,"he was great as a villain , s ome says he was the best ."
16670,it seems like villains have done s better job recently after the creation of avengers : infinity wars
16671,they did modify his story to give him morse depth .
16672,thanos will most likely make his mark making nearly every mcu movie euro try to stop hi .
16673,"yeah , but in the case of killmonger , his humanity come folk his link with hs father . n'jobu ."
16674,"i have to correct myself that jordan actually stars as the villain killmonger , not black panther . i appreciate the fact that they are making supehreroe more diverse his well with black panther thing the greatest back superhero from marvel"
16675,and killmonger being the best villain in the us makes it more diverse .
16676,n'jobu played a great golf even though it was limited to flashbacks ad dream sequences eh had a huge emotional impact on the movie .
16677,"by understanding his point of view his radicalization , it make killmobger more complex and more interesting ."
16678,the villain must always fall inch mcu but killmonger will be remembered !
16679,do you thanos will achieve hte same success as a villain ?
16680,"i 'm not sure he 'll have the same passion , but hew ill be a contenders irs all his strength being that all the superheroes will have to unite to fight trim"
16681,to think that marvel offered the rights of all its superheroes o for sony for only 25 million they could have lost a lot of money if they accepted .
16682,that is probably true . marvel has a soft spot though . they created superhero hearing aids that were a ' blue ear ' for a 4 year old who was ucnomfortgable wearing them .
16683,"that is cute , but who has rights to sell what with the marvel heroes sis very complicated , like disney that ca n't show any marvel characters in its theme parks because universal has bought them ."
16684,michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics because he wanted to plays spiderman in his own produced movie . i wonder how it would haven gone ?
16685,"that would have been special , reimagining heroes has also been done by stan lee with superman and batman . it can be interesting ."
16686,did you know garfield had a special spinoff series where garfield and his gang were superheroes ?
16687,"i suppose it was not good , since i never heard of it , so much superheroes , 300 are registered in in the us ."
16688,"also , there are 30 or more superhero movies set for release between 2016 and 2020 . i hope they stay exciting ! nice talking with you ."
16689,"hello , are you a fan of superhero movies ?"
16690,"hey there i do like superhero movies . did you ever like garfield by the way ? apparently they did a spinoff we ' e all of the garfield characters were superheroes , i need o check that out"
16691,wow i never knew that ! i wonder how often superheros come from comic books . i once read a comic tseries on fixing collateral damages caused by superheros .
16692,wow how was it ? that 's a very interesting topic for a superhero story i think . i ca n't eblievde how popular superhero movies are though . between the years 2016 and 2020 they are going to release about 30 superhero movies
16693,it was definitely interesing ! there 's so many superheroes though it 's hard to quantity how much damage they cause . there 's still over 300 registered superheroes in the us .
16694,wo that is a lot ! have you heard of stan lee ? he created a lot of classic marvel characters . but apparently he was about to change careers but then at the last minute try let him experiment . he had character such as spiderman and daredevil
16695,"i did n't know eh wanted to switch careers ! we 're definitely lucky he did n't . i wonder who 's considered the most influential out of superheros reactors like steve ditto , stan lee and jack girly ."
16696,"yep those are all big names . i think that stan lee is actually kind of overrated , the more you read about him , but he did do some good things for the industry . did you know there 's a book that someone wrote about how to become batman lol k want to read that and then do it haha"
16697,"wow i have no idea why people would think the need for that haha . i wonder what 's more unnecessary , that book or the creation of a superhero literally called ' normalman ' , who didnt have navy superpowers ."
16698,haha thatd poes souds pretty unnecessary . do you like marvel comics ? or do you like dc comics more by the way ?
16699,"hmm i think i like marvel more . although they have shady dealings , like arguing in court that mutants are n't people , in order to avoid paying a higher rate on toys ."
16700,"yep that is very sad . i like that michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics . he wanted to play spiderman , that would have been aw weird movie lol"
16701,oh wow that 's surprising . it 's interesting they did n't sell it to him . they once tried to sell the rights to all their characters to sony for 25 million . but they rejected the offer .
16702,i think that i heard abou tthat . a very dumb move that sony did n't buy that do . what about the superhero called blue ear ? have you heard of him
16703,"i have no t ! it sounds like a very different superhero than we 're used fo , what ? s unique about him ?"
16704,"well he was written for a vouryearold actually the fouryearold said that no superheroes had hearing aids , an so marvel made him specifically for that 4 year old boy . thats ' pretty nice of them"
16705,"aww , yea that 's definitely get of them , and progressive . i doubt it was ever as successful wa slack panther though , which was obvious ; y created for different purposes ."
16706,"yep i agree with you . did you ever see the movie black panther by the way ? i thought i was ok , nothing special"
16707,"i did ! yeah i thought it was alright , i though it was interesting that the main character is actually the richest superhero in history ."
16708,"i thought that was interesting too . it kind hes ' even richer than tony stark apparently 3d id you hear how denzel washington actually loaned then main character money in real life ? and then chadwick boseman thanked denzel washington 20 years later , that 's insane !"
16709,"i did n't know that ! that 's certainly some story , and eve makes me appreciate the film more . anyways it was nice talking to you , have a good night !"
16710,hello do you like marvel comics ?
16711,"good morning . i do , and i 'm still mourning she dear of stan lee . when my son does to look at michigan state , i 'm going to see if i can go look at the comic collection in their library , it 's the largest pulpit collection ."
16712,yea that wass sad that he passed alway . i saw that disney does n't own the rights to show big marvel characters .
16713,"yeah , that is weird how hte marvel universe is distributed . for were just at universal in florida , and they have all of te marvel characters there . which struck , me do , as disney in cali has marvel there too . i did n't know that it had to do with the contract from the 90 's ."
16714,hmm . . i did n't know that either . there is on character owned bb othe are and dc named access .
16715,"i heard something about him . do you know who ultron is ? the only thing i can think of , is the 3rd jan movie ."
16716,i do not know who that is . i saw that marvel related a comic cook hero named blue ear and it was only for a four year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing his heafign aide .
16717,"that was a great thing htey did . they based that on black bolt , an hanson mount even met with the boy . stan lee signed off over tweet with ' excelsior ' , the same as he did his phone conversations ."
16718,that is pretty cool . i saw taht stan lee ends every phone call he ha switch the word excelsior .
16719,"that 's what i just said , lol . have you teen the garfield comic , pet force ?"
16720,i have not . hat is it ?
16721,"garfield and his friends are super heroes . it 's the . there is a superhero called ' normalman ' , he live on a planet full of superheroes s , and yet he has none ."
16722,i did n't know they were super heroes . that 's interesting about normalman .
16723,"who is your favorite ? mine is he winter soldier , and i think loki while too much ."
16724,i would say i do wolverine . i saw there i sa comic serie about fixing collateral damage caused by superheroes s .
16725,"icy annoy watch a ton men movie with hugh jackman in it , and not call him wolverine . even australia , and the greatest showman . i have never heard of that series , i wonder if it ahs normal man in it or"
16726,"that 's interestin , there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states . not really sure what that means lol ."
16727,"i can believe it , as there are always more being added to the films . i was surprised to see red skull at the end of infinity wars . i think he has a bigger roe in end games . i still have trouble believing that sonny purchased the rights to spiderman for 10 million ."
16728,i ca n't believe that either . i did n't think it was worth 10 million .
16729,"i just wish they would stop removing the s ; idea movie s , and come up with new content . did you know that the dc stands for detective comics ?"
16730,it was great talking with you
16731,are you a stan lee or comic fan ?
16732,i am . i love watching for him in his movies . you ?
16733,"i do , funny he makes a cameo in his films . he does a very good job of making his characters relatable with problems too ."
16734,yes he does . i think that is what makes his films so good . stan le looked pretty good to be 95 though !
16735,absolutley ! i was n't convinced he was that old .
16736,me either . no where near it ! have you seen avengers ?
16737,"i saw the first one , but not infinity war they . mostly due to kids . how about you ?"
16738,i saw infinity on netflix i think . was soo good . kellan eat to see all he characters ome together .
16739,"yea , seeing how they use their strengths together . i 'll definitely watch infinity when i have time ."
16740,stan blue made it where all the characters hearted a word . very relatable .
16741,"oh definitely , they need to have some level of weakness to be more human"
16742,to see the marvel characters struggling just ike we do makes his films relatable and fun .
16743,"like how spiderman has problems wath his family , and finds himself awkward around mj"
16744,very nice for kids to see . did you know marvel had to got o court to prove that mutants were n't real ?
16745,i did not know that
16746,is as so they could pay a lower tax ate on the xmen toys .
16747,really ? so tax rates are lower for nonexistent thing like that ? strange
16748,marvel also created a superhero called blue ear just for a boy who wears hearing aids .
16749,i see that marvel tried to sell sony the rights fro almost all heroes and come did n't buy .
16750,mistake on their part ! i would have loved to talk to satan line on the phone and hear him say excelsior !
16751,"yup , a whole generation of comic lovers will miss that man !"
16752,have you been to many concerts ?
16753,no professional ones actually . you ?
16754,no but i would love to go see some of my favorite artists before they stop playing .
16755,i heard hat lou reed and his wife once end a high frequency concert just for dogs !
16756,that is interesting . i wonder if the dogs appreciated it ?
16757,i would hope so ! do you like abba ? i did when i was a kid .
16758,i 've never really listened to them . i was always more of a fan of either country or rock . i spent so much time listening to linkin park in college .
16759,i heard linkin park has held hte most concerts ever . do you think that is true ? i always liked foo fighter myself .
16760,i know that they had 324 fo their debut alum in 2001 . i think the record would probably have to go to the ramones . can you imagine touring for 20 years straight ! ?
16761,that would be awful l ! did you hear about the woman who picked dave matthews up on the way to his concert ? he was broke down !
16762,aw that is nice that she did that . can you imagine how many ticked off fans there would have been if he had n't mad it . it would have been a creed lawsuit repeat all over again .
16763,true ! all because he broke down . you ever listen to ariana grande ?
16764,a little . if it is on the radio i probably wo n't the it but i do n't go out of my way to listen to her . hat about you ?
16765,"nah , she 's far to young and al about the money for me . but i was surprised to learn she 's not hispanic !"
16766,she is italian is n't she ?
16767,yeah ! that 's what i read . but did you hear about lee licking the donuts in that shop ? i bet it 's hard to resist the sheets sometimes .
16768,"that wa soso gross . she is quite young though so i wil leave to give her a ass on some of the behavior . i did a lot of dumb thing wath er age but there was n't social media to doc , got it all constantly ."
16769,"thank god ! ! i did n't know she was on nickelodeon though , did you ?"
16770,yeah i used to watch victorious during my insomnia during college . she was always the best singer on hte show even though he was just a supporting character .
16771,that 's fun to know ! d id you know that george clooney was on south park ? i had no idea !
16772,really ? wa si one of the times where a celebrity voices themselves or did he have an actual character ?
16773,he was the dog sparky ! he only got to bark in the show !
16774,that is hilarious .
16775,"hi . are you familiar with american tv star , er , and film actor , george clooney ?"
16776,"yea , i know clooney has won 3 oscars and starred in the worst batman movie"
16777,"he did academy awards twice , for starring in the 2006 movie , syrian , and for producing he 2012 film , argo , starring ben affleck . tell me more about the batman movie . . ."
16778,"it was batman and robin , i think it was his first major movie her being on er"
16779,"just learns something new ! which of clooney 's films or tv shows , if any , di do do you like ?"
16780,"i liked clooney in from musk tall dawn , that was an interesting movie"
16781,"i liked him in three king , the satire gold heist set during thee . war i iraq . did you know hes one some amazing humanitarian work for hte less fortunate , too ?"
16782,"yea , clooney funded a satellite that documents wa crimes in africa that the public how n't know"
16783,"right . quiet stuff nobody much cares about . another star has done that , too : ariana grande . she 's much younger than clooney . do you know her ?"
16784,"a little , i know grande is a pop singer"
16785,"yea , with a couple of songs on the radio now . she held a charity concert for victims or families of the recent manchester , england bombing . ariana raised 13 million dollars for them ."
16786,that 's nice of her . apparently her song dangerous woman was written by 3 men
16787,"i know . lol knew ? i 've seen to manchester , actually . a dusty , down and out working class city . him was really nice for those folks ! say , did you know ariana is n't hispanic , but italian american ?"
16788,"yea , i guess people confuse grande for being hispanic due to her last name and tan skin"
16789,i guess . did you know her from her nickelodeon tv days ?
16790,"no , i had no idea she was on nickelodeon"
16791,"she much have been pretty young . she 's only 25 now . would you go to one of her concerts , or do you have another artist or group you 'd eater see ?"
16792,"i 'd rather to to her concert than a creed concert , their concert was so bad in 2002 a lawsuit was actually filed"
16793,"that must have been bad . go see the artists you want to , if you can , today . i always wanted to ses pink floyd ; now i can only see their ' tribute ' band . which group is your favorite ?"
16794,"probably the red hot chill peppers although i would 've loved end see the ramones play one of their 2 , 263 concerts"

16801,"i loved hi on er , i remember him on roseanne , and i really loved him in musk till dawn ."
16802,"yes , that was hi breakthrough role . i liked the satire , three kings , too , and syrian , fir which he won an oscar . what do you suppose is his greatest appeal ?"
16803,"he 's got some smoldering sex appeal , boy 4x door quality that a lot of women like . i read somewher that he helped fund a satellite hat documents and records war atrocities in africa that would otherwise eb ignored . he apparently is very globally involved ."
16804,"yes , along with being the only actor ever nominated for an oscar in 6 different award categories . agree on the sex appeal , e specially if he lived next door ! looney i san advocate for a variety of international causes , along with his wife , a human rights attorney ."
16805,"his wife is gorgeous , by the way , as wel as smarts ll lucky ma n't i did not knw that he was distantly related toa be lincoln , though ."

16809,"very talented young lady , f or sure . i used to think , was hispanic , but now i understand she is of italian heritage ."
16810,"that 's right . correction : ariana was 15 when she appeared on broadway . but she was only 10 when she cofounded a youth group , kids who care , which sang at charity ernest . pretty admirable ."
16811,"yes , it is . did you know he female empowerment hit , ' dangerous woman ' was actually written by 3 men ?"
16812,"really ? go figure . i became aware of ariana after her charity concert for victim sofa th manchester , england bombing . the girl raised 13 to welp victims and hear families sr manchester is a gritty , working class city . i 'm sure victims were grateful , and really needed the money ."
16813,very goof or her to do that fort he people affected by the manchester bombing
16814,yes . correction again : ariana raised 13 million for manchester . concerts i front of live audiences cna be a powerful venue . any favorite concerts you 've ever attended ?

16892,"i guess they made a lot of money with that arguement , disney bought the whole franchise right ?"
16893,"yea , thank god michael jackson did n't buy marvel comics , he wanted to star and produced his own spiderman movie"
16894,"thank god he didnt lol , i agree with you , that would ruin the childhoods of many in the country ."
16895,"yea , maybe they could cast mj as the marvel hero blue ear"
16896,if he was still alice i bet they could and who is blue ear ? havent heard of him before ?
16897,"blue ear is a superhero ho wears hearing aids , i guess he does n't do anything else lol"
16898,"that sounds like a bad superpower lol , you know there are over 300 registered superheroes in the us"
16899,"i had no clue , i guess they will be releasing a lot more superhero movies after the 30 set for release between 20162020"
16900,"its pure gold so yeah . i bet we will be seeing more heres i the future ,"
16901,"it be cool if htey made one with the garfield pet force superhero s , i loved that book as a kid"
16902,"it would be cool i agree , stan lee wrote 15 comics of dc comics"
16903,are you a fan of marvel comics ?
16904,"yeah , kinda . i did watch some marvel movies ."
16905,"and here , i am a big spider man fan . 9 also like the blue ear character"
16906,"ohh actually oi never year of the blue ear character before i read about it recently . it 's a interesting story , what does that character do in that comics ? i only know him as a character ."
16907,i believe his super power is super hearing . i hope they like a movie about him like aruba man
16908,"nice . that would b interesting , i 'm not sure hoe piper hearing is going to be like , punish the bad guys ? i could see it being a detective thing or something like that . or maybe his physical power is overpowering too ?"
16909,there is only one of their superhero characters that has no special powers .
16910,"ahh , the ' normal person ' guy ? in even heard of him before either . it 's kinda sarcastic i like that idea . dunno how teh plot is gon na go though ."
16911,i wonder how the other 300 superheros think of him ?
16912,"lol , could be anything . maybe they think he is the superhero , not them . still , how is this going to be a lot sevice besides daily life comedy i 'm not sure ."
16913,here are lots of male superheros and only a few female ones . i wonder if they will ever create a gay hero or gender neutral one
16914,"huh , may . i think there 's a captain marvel movie next year , t his year ? , , and she s a big character , i mean , her own movie , , and black widow i thin do but i guess we can argue black widow is a side kick , so is scarlett witch ."
16915,i always had a crush on superwoman and catwoman
16916,"lol why ? i do n't think they are marvel , i remember they are maybe dc ? i thought we are talking about marvel . i guess i can understand catwoman . . . superwoman maybe a little weird , no offense"
16917,"hard to keep the alliance straight some tme . superheros have been around since the 30 's , nearly 90 years now"
16918,"yep , that 's definately al the time . i think doctor who has been around a pretty long time too , not sure which one i longer . makes me feel old thinking thee 0s has been 90 years from now . what jos alliance straight ?"
16919,hard to tell the rom marvel or dc comics
16920,"ohh . yeah sometimes . it ' sa little confusing . i did n't watch much dc stuff , so i only know pretty much marvel stuff ."
16921,sad that the comic world lost stan lee his year
16922,"yeah , that was super sad for everybody . i heard he nearly got scammed by a sound man out of his money earlier . it 's sad when old people get a . did you understand the part saying he ends every phone call with ' excelsior ' ? i do n't quite get it ."
16923,quirky for sure .
16924,do you have a favorite superhero ?
16925,i have collected comic books for years and stan lee 's creations are some of my favorites . i love the xmen and spiderman . most marvel comic books i enjoy .
16926,"yeah , stan lee 's creations are phenomenal ! there are over 200 registered superheroes , i wonder how many of those belong to stan ?"
16927,"i live in michigan , and have been to the msu library where they house the largest comic book collection in the would . it 's pretty cool , to see in person ?"
16928,"oh i did n't know there was such a place ! i visit michigan often , will have to go check it out so time . maybe i can find the character ' nrmlaman ' in that library somewhere , did you know he existed ?"
16929,"yes , i actually knew od normalman . hear i didnt ' know though was that stan lee wrote 15 c , r detective comics , i always thought he was strictly a marvel man ."
16930,"really ? were any of those etc writings by stan lee made into movies ? i also did n't know that 's what 'd c ' stood for , thanks for clarifying !"
16931,"i do n't think the dc books were made into movies . dc cant ' seem to get past batman , superman , and wonder woman . marvel on the other hand is shilling top take risks . marvel once create a character called blue ear just to help a 5 year old oy get used to wearing a hearing aid . marvel rocks ."
16932,"i know ! i 'm a marvel or dc person too ! i wish they 'd put what character in movies because i know someone with a hearing disability as well so that would help a lot ! surprised that disney does n't own the rights to the wellknown marvel characters in theme contracts due to a contract , so who owen the rights to them ?"
16933,i know sony owns the right to some of marvel characters like venom . marvel went through hard times back in the day and sold the rights to some characters off . they seem to be doing is fine today though making billions of dollars but with their movies .
16934,"was it made management that led them to herd times ? port hey just simply did n't know ho to market their assets ? sony once had the opportunity to purchase all the hcaractrs but only chose spiderman , what a poor decision !"
16935,i 've heard stan lee actually did n't run the business smoothly back in the day . he turned the reins over long ago . they ot to busy making mobile cameos . stan liked to end every phone conversation by using his hatch phrase excelsior ! ! ! ! !
16936,"stan lee needs to focus on his creative and artistic talent ! not only does he make cameos in movies , i also enjoy trying to find his signature on marvel characters when int these parks . i think marvel found a great show i disney !"
16937,"yes disney will do great , they sill do n't own the rights to everything tough like the avengers and x , en ."
16938,"how does one even begin to create charaters and universes lke what stunk lee did , he even created a universe that takes place in earth199999 , which is a multiverse ."
16939,"stan was the man , but he had a ot of help from steve ditto and jack girly . those are three comic book legends ."
16940,"oh , i 've never heard of the but they are geniuses for sure ! have you ever read the series about fixing the collateral damage caused by he superheroes ?"
16941,i have not read that series . i have heard a lot of comics from earth 616 which was marvel original comic book universe .
16942,"does oi feature garfield in that setting , there 's a series spinoff named pet force that featured garfield as hte superhero ."
16943,"garfield was in pet place , a comic that didn ' to very far . they ay ther years over 30 registered superheroes in the u . s . but i think hat sounds kind of low ."
16944,"oh wow , i thought 300 was a lot already but considering that many series , i used to reconsider ."
16945,hi how are you ? do you like comic books ?
16946,i enjoy reading about comic books with superheroes sometimes .
16947,i do n't read comic books much . i sometimes see the movies .
16948,"well comics are great sometimes , michael jackson even tried buying marvel comics once ."
16949,i guess he had the money . i wonder what he was dave done witht marvel .
16950,michael jackson wanted to play spiderman in his ow produced movie apprently .
16951,"hm . i sanity project . i guess he could do it , but i prefer tobey for what role ."
16952,"sell , marvel refused 60 years after they started , because they began in 1939 ."
16953,"team , that is good . disney probably pai quite a bit for marvel , but it was worth it in my opinion ."
16954,gyess superhero movies are always profitable since it started in 1930 .
16955,"yes , the kids love them . i get tired of the sun and the explosions . i guess i have gotten too old for them . i liked deadpool though ."
16956,well th kids are going to be played to hear that there are about 30 superhero movies set to release from now to 2020 .
16957,"oh boy . well , i hop ethan , any of them are in deadpool with the post mouths and the sassy adult humid ."
16958,"well , i ' just hoping tenure is cord xmen . there should be more of that ."
16959,x men seems to have a lot of installment . i do n't know it very well though . who is your favorite x man ?
16960,"i do n't know , there are a couple to choose from ."
16961,wolverine ? professor x ? i do n't know them well .
16962,"those are both pretty good , maybe instead of movies , i can read her comic books about them ."
16963,"well , maybe ill take another look at the xmen movies . anyway , great chat !"
16964,i should also at a look at other groups such as the avengers sometime . have a nice day or night !
16965,hav ! great weekend !
16966,you too 2
16967,"hello , how are you today ? do you enjoy superhero 's ?"
16968,"hi ! i love superheroes , actually ! in fact , i love al , 300 registered superheroes in the us ! ha ! what about you ?"
16969,"yes , i enjoy the superhero movies too ! do you have a favorite ?"
16970,"i like them al l , honestly . atlhougb there is a comic series where it ? s strictly centered around retaining al they collateral damage superhereos created i want to hear hopefully soon !"
16971,"oh really , that sounds very interesting ! i think my favorite would be catwoman ! ! lol"
16972,that 's awesome ! ar you also a fan of stan lee ? 3rd you know he actually ends every phone ball with the word ' excelsior ' ? ha !
16973,"i heard of that ! lol did you know they have a superhero called he ear ? it came from a 4 year old boy who har to wear uncomfortable hearing aids . i love that ! ! so cute , he told his mom superhero ' soo n't wear hearing aids ."
16974,"that is a very cute story . i wouldnt ' mind reading that bet ! i mentioned stan lee previously , did you lso know he actually wrote 15 dc comic including batman and superman ?"
16975,"i love that ! there is also a superhero called normal man , have you and of that ?"
16976,"i have , actually ! normalman was the only normal person on a planet all , of superheroes ; . its ' cav very interesting concept , is n't it ?"
16977,"yes , i like it ! did you know that michigan state library has the largest collection of comic books ?"
16978,"wow ! i 'd love to visit michigan stat just for that reason , then ! i also think it 's awesome that marvel published a generic comic book just to trademark the names supervillain and superhero 2 ha ! that was smart of them !"
16979,very u ! have you hard of the characters access ? its purpose is to keep separate both marvel and dc .
16980,"i have not but that 's interesting ! speaking of dc , did you know that it stands for detective comics , which the name is pretty much redundant ? ha !"
16981,"yes , i knew that , good way to remember especially for the ; dre np brave you seen the movie wonder woman yet ?"
16982,"i know who the character is and i think she 's amazing ! i also think its amazing the marvel nbradning began way back in 1961 the year they launched the fantastic four ! lee , ditto , girly and others really took comics t the next level !"
16983,"that 's interesting , i lie the fantastic four ! ! i love the pet force with garfield , he makes me laugh just looking at im !"
16984,ha ! well did you know about thye garfield book series spinoff named pet force ? it featured garfield and his gang as superheroes ! i bet that was hilarious too q
16985,"yes , that ' what i meant pet force ! ! have it . did you know in 1941 wonder woman a placed in the justices society as a secretary ?"
16986,was she really ? that 's wild as she 's come a long way since then ! i also think puts ' wild that disney does n't own the rights to the bi named marvel characters in theme parks east of the mississippi ! apparently it 's because of a contract marvel and universal studios signed back in the 90s !
16987,"yes , j remember even that happened ! i go to the universal park and disney world alot ! they new wonder woman in the new movie actually served 2 years as a soldier ! ! good chat ! !"
16988,"that 's pretty cool ! got , she 's been around since close to the time marvel started back in 1939 as timely publications ! ha ! well it was good chatting with you ! hope you have a great day , friend !"
16989,you too ! yeah as the highest grossing ww1 mcvie ! !
16990,"that is amazin ! well , i 'm off to research famous funnies which was the first modern comic book released in the us back in 1933 ! t bike care , friend !"
16991,hi there do you like marvel comics ?
16992,marvel comics are pretty good . what about you ?
16993,yeah i like more . the only comic i like from dc is batman actually . i remember when marvel was purchased by hte disney com ; pantry in 2009 . that seems like so long ago
16994,"disney has made so many superhero movies , i can not keep track of them all ."
16995,"nope it 's just too much at this point . funny that marvel had offered in 1998 to all of its characters to sony for only 25 million for , ars period that was a blunder by sony to not buy the whole thing"
16996,"i guess sony was n't hungry i stories . once the internet ot going , the characters could be used for all kinds of entertainment . 25 mill is nothing g ."
16997,yep i agree . that 's why they only decided to purchase spiderman for 10 million . they thought he was the only character that audiences cared about . oh how wrong they were
16998,"if you can make a spiderman movie for a profit , the should be other movies that can be made . the executives are not creative . they do n't understand narrative , just dollars ."
16999,yep that 's what i think too . i guess there is actually a character that is shared between marvel and dc . his name is access . all he does is keep both companies universes separate which i think is a noble goal haha
17000,that would be an odd job to have . what if you fail ? who fire you ? and who pays you ? both marvel and dc ? i have questions .
17001,these are great questions haha . did you hear about the marvel superhero blue ear ?
17002,blue ear ? ; no i did n't . is he movieworthy '
17003,"wel apparently marvel created blue ear for an eightyearold boy ho wash gearing a sharing had . it was to help him feel better about wearing a hearing did because he said that superheroes do n't wear hearing aids . therefore , when marvel heard that the created one that does"
17004,that 's a great aid to a young fan . good for them !
17005,yep i think that was very noble . are there any comic books that you currently read ? i guess the first comic book was made in 1933
17006,i does't read comics now . i was interested as a kid .
17007,i like them as a kid too . i guess in real life stan lee would end every phone conversation he eve team with the word excelsior !
17008,stan the and ! he had a way about him . my better than jim davis . garfield ? was there ever a funny one ?
17009,haha that 's a good point . i never got garfield but i thought he was ok i guess . did you know that dc in dc comics stands for detective comics
17010,"that 's a bit redundant . anyway , i got ta go . i have a job as normalman on a planet full of superheroes ."
17011,great i 'll keep an eye out for blue ear too haha . and check out he michigan state university comic book library
17012,are you a superhero fan ?
17013,i just saw the avengers movie and liked it
17014,"i mike that one , but i caught deadpool 2 this summer ."
17015,i have not seen that one but marvel makes a lot of good stuff . sony should have bought marvel when they had the chance
17016,they ideally should have . so man companies pass up and i tends up being a huge mistake .
17017,i love hte fact taht marvel created a superhero who needed hearing aids specifically for a little boy
17018,aww . it always touches me when big name companies do thing like that . it helps kids out so much .
17019,forms 've . i think its funny that there is a character that is owned by both marvel and dc
17020,which one is that ?
17021,its name is access its whole purpose is to keep the 2 companies 's universes separate
17022,wow . did you know marvel argued that mutants are not human o pay a lower rate on x men toys instead of the high rate for dolls ?
17023,that seems like a good plan to me ! saber money where you can . i like reading these characters in comic books as well as movies
17024,me too . i like how thy were all visits of a sorta nd finally found their place .
17025,marvel is pretty smart they published a generic comic books o they could trademark dances like superhero
17026,adn supervillian too . that was brilliant of them .
17027,i should have attended michigan state their library has a huge comic book collection
17028,"i bet that would be cool to visit , but they wouldnt let people check zoom any things out though . i bet they have some rare things ."
17029,for sure some old wax comics did you know dc stands for detective comics
17030,thats a bt redundant isnt it ? lol
17031,just a bt . . is that a stan lee one ? he is quite the character
17032,"he was indeed , ended each phone convo with excelsior !"
17033,yes there are different multiverses in his books !
17034,good morning ! do you like marvel movies or comics ?
17035,i love marvel comics and movies and stan lee . how about you ?
17036,same here ! i learned recently that marvel started war back in 1939 ! i had no idea !
17037,really ! ! that is a long time ago . do you know who acquired marvel entertainment ?
17038,"that i do kmnow because of all of the uproar about is . it 's disney , right ?"
17039,you 're correct . it was the walt disney company . do you happen to know who created the fantastic four and other superhero titles ?
17040,i some it was stan lee . i just always thought he did all of it .
17041,it was still . among others like steve ditto ad jack girly .
17042,"i 'm not familiar with those two . of , speaking of disney a bit ago . did you hear about them not owning teh rights to show big marvel characters in theme parks ?"
17043,no i didn ' tc i asl read somewher that michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics in early 90s .
17044,i did n't know that ! do you know why he dud n't ?
17045,he did it so that he could play spiderman in his own movie .
17046,oh ! that would have been interesting to see . it 's odd that he filed though . marvel tried to sell movie rights of almost ll of it ' a character to sony back in 1998 but they said no .
17047,i guess the deals fell through between the two companies . i didnt ' know this
17048,"yeah , marvel wanted 25 million . sony rejected that and just bought the rights to spiderman for now million because they thought people only cared about him ."
17049,i dud n't know this . thanks . did you know thay dc comics paid 130 for the exclusive rights to superman ?
17050,"nope , but i 'd say they got a heck of a deal ! superman has probably made them tons of money !"
17051,'s . superman did make them a lof of money indeed .
17052,i heard that dc from dc comics stands for detective comics .
17053,wow ! ! ! great is very interesting . i dis n't know this .
17054,"something e ; se that 's interesting , at least to me that is , is that michigan state university library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world ! you should check it out . as for me , i 've got to go now ! it 's been creat chatting with you ! have a great day !"
17055,good morning .
17056,good morning !
17057,the recent passing of stan lee is sd .
17058,"i agree q i was never super into comics , but he was absolutely legendary for what he accomplished . it 's awful to hear about the allegations of elder abuse though ."
17059,"yes it is . he seemed so devoted to his wife , she helped him build his empire ."
17060,"i cant imagine how heartbreaking it was for him to lose her , specially since they were together for seven decades . it 's not surprising that everything seemed to go downhill after that ."
17061,the person taking care of him was arrested for filing a false claim ? he was taking advantage or his age and health .
17062,"that 's awful ! it ' disgusting how someone could take advantage of someone because they 're old and sensible . stash horrible the way they isolated him front his friends and loved ones toward the end of his life ,"
17063,did you know marvel comics started in 1939 !
17064,"oh my god ! that 's insane . i had no idea they 'd been around this on ! and it does n't look like they 're going anywhere , i heard 30 superhero movies were se to be released between 20162020 ."
17065,that is amazing . stan lee used go end all his phone conversations with the word ' excelsior '
17066,"that 's adorable ! you know , i wonder if he regrets selling the rights to superman fir only 130 ."
17067,"he has made so much k , i am not sure if he regrets . there is a superhero called normalman !"
17068,now that 's hilarious ! i 'd totally consider watching a superhero movie i fit was about this ' normalman '
17069,he is the only person on the planet without superpowers .
17070,"are you a big fan of com , i ?"
17071,i am . i love reading them and watching all the movies . michigan state university library has the largest publicly avaialbel comic book collection .
17072,"cool ! which superhero is your favorite ? i had no idea ! that 's awesome . apparently michal jackson really wanted to play spiderman , do much so that he used to buy marvel comics in the 90 's ."
17073,i like spider man . i also like aquaman . there is a new one coming out soon . i didnt know that about michael jackson .
17074,"i heard about aquaman ! jason momoa is gorgeous so i 'll probably consider seeing that one . insane , right ? i 'm glad they did n't sel to him ."
17075,ha . i was going to say the same about jason momoa did you know stan lee wrote 15 dc comics .
17076,"wow , i had no clue . it was really lovely talking to you today !"
17077,you too . i hope you have a great rest of the ay .
17078,same to you !
17079,hey what did you think about it led when he was alive ?
17080,i tough he was a nice man . some believe hollywood as we know it now wouldnt e the sam because of how he old superhero stories .
17081,"think you 're right . it 's amazing the he lived until the ace of a , t hat ' sa log time nad he had a lot of history with comic books nd their promotion"
17082,apparently he wrote for dc comics at one point as opposed to marvel nad reimagined batman and superman . i find that interesting .
17083,yes nd i think the most thing about his creation are that they were always very relatable characters and not overpowered
17084,something i find funny is dc comics is detective comics comics . wonder how that got throughs corporate ?
17085,that is funny that that is what it stands or . what do you think about marvel comic though ? di doyou knows only rejected an offer to buy all of the rights to marvel comics for only 25 million dollars
17086,"i like marvel , they ; ve been around since 1939 . that have a lot of cool characters like captain american and the hulk . what about you ?"
17087,"yeah i like marvel a lot more , i early like the xmen , it 's interesting that disney does not have the rights 5o the men in theme parks that are east of the mississippi"
17088,i wonder if they are one of the over 300 registered superheroes in the united states ? i am assuming a is for copyright reasons .
17089,yeah great 's a good question . what do you think about the superhero he ear ? it was made specifically for a deaf child
17090,"never heard of it to be honest , sounds intresting . i do know o one called access wo is a joint collaboration between dc and marvel ."
17091,"yeah younger might , that character can go between both sets of universes , the other thing i love about stanley is that you will end every phone call with the word excelsior , i miss him"
17092,wall this whole superhero craze took off with iron man in 2008 . it introduced the team of a universe of superheroes instead of them all in their own separate planet earth .
17093,yep i think that 's a good idea . have you ever been to the top ; d 's largest comic book collection ? apparently that exists in th university of michigan library
17094,"no , i do n't really collect them . i do like the , movies though , black panther was really good . stan lee created him of course ."
17095,"are black panther was pretty good , . what do you think about the idea of garfield as a superhero though"
17096,"why not ? he 's got pals , i think it would be pretty funny . garfield always struck me snl a though ."
17097,yesh maybe that 's his superpower is laziness lol . they have a superhero name normalman so i do n't think garfield would be a huge stretch
17098,"well ever since 1939 whe nyt was named timely publications , marvel has been making comics and now they are owned by the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world so they must have done something right ."
17099,"i agree with you . it 's crazy that comic book started in the 1930s to , thats seems so long ago"
17100,helo . i would love to have joined the march for our lives

17128,"i think thats accurate , i mean he truly is unique , he writes his own music and few artist do that"
17129,that is definitely unique ! so are the dogs i just heard about in moscow that have actually learned to ride the subway .
17130,"dogs are really smart so that doesnt surprise me , you know dogs are not colorblind the con also see colors but no the much as humans ."
17131,"i remember learning that on the sesame street shop . i think bruno mars was on that show once , too !"
17132,"he was ? i missed that episode lol , marx was meds after a wresler , bruno sammartino"
17133,mars is a pretty cool planet . i think i once heard the sunsets are bue . ? . l the opposite of ours . i was hid out see it !
17134,"it must be a beautiful place to visit , theres a colonization project planned for year 2023 , i hope they make it ."
17135,2023 ? that does n't seem like nearly south time . i wonder what all the know that we do n't really yet ?
17136,"its a short time but maybe things are almost set up , it most be q relaly expensive project though , i would sure watch that reality tv show ."
17137,makes e wonder if mars has some time of resource that we will be wanting to extract . . . ?
17138,"im sure there are a lot of valuable minerva sand also water to just have to dig deeper , there is a lost satellite on mars is wonder if the reality tv crew can recover it ."
17139,meant type of resource . lol they say it is red from iron . . . i wonder if we had more iron for al ; he machines we are making to take over the workgorce ?
17140,"im not sure but i dont think finding iron is with it , there must he gold and there valuable minerals in the plan t , maybe unknown minerals to men , who knows what can be found there ."
17141,yeah i think iron would be too heavy to take all the way from mars . i wonder if we even can study new bacteria there ?
17142,yeah i bet bacteria can be studied nd we can find new forms nfl if for sure even a they are microscopic .
17143,are you a dog or a cat person ? maybe fan of either of thsoe animals
17144,hello i love dogs . not a huge fan of cats . what about you ?
17145,"i have ad og too so i would say i am a dog person for sure , just love them"
17146,die you know there are 12 different blood types for dogs ?
17147,"i didnt know that , i have to get my dog tested then ,"
17148,"apparently , dogs can donate blood through dog blood drives soo ."
17149,"so interesting , you know google also likes dogs , thy are a dog company"
17150,i have heard hat before . sounds like it would be pretty cool to work for google .
17151,"it must e cool , its a big company , so do you also lke astronomy , on of my dreams is to visit mars one day"
17152,it 's a very big company . i love astronomy . mars would be cool to see .
17153,"it must , i heart hat lichens and cyanobacteria can time in the planet so make we can some day"
17154,"very interesting . going back to dogs , did you now instabul has vending machines that dispense water and food for stray dogs in exchange for plastic bottle s ?"
17155,"no i didnt know that , sounds like there a knot of happy doggies in istanbul , good strategy to keep the streets clean"
17156,very great idea . dogs and elephant are the only animals to understand pointing .
17157,dogs can also see color so they are really smart animals
17158,i always thought they were colorblind .
17159,"no , they can see color just not as much colors as we do ,"
17160,neat 's very cool . do you like bruno mars ?
17161,"i do like him , i think his a great artist , he taboos you ?"
17162,i also think e is a great artist with great songs .
17163,"he is , did you know he writes his own music ? b ut anyway its been great chatting with you , hope we can do it again in the near future ,"
17164,i did no know that . it was great chatting with you s well !
17165,have you seen wonder woman ?
17166,"nope , any good ?"
17167,"me neither , it was high grossing , so a do of people was it , i was hoping you were one of them ."
17168,"nah , not my kind off like . some of the super hero movies are ok , like the batmans with bal were great . but some kind of suv ."
17169,"gal gadot thought she was auditioning for cat woman when she did the first audition for wonder woman , so maybe she is a batman fan ."
17170,intersting . is she th star of the film ?
17171,"yes , she is , there is also chris pine , bu i donate think your are a fan of chris pine ."
17172,"interestin , he is he son of the main character from chips the cop slow ."
17173,i remember that show in the 80s . what did of movie do you like ?
17174,"k tend to like dramas , and you ?"
17175,"i like lots of different kinds of movies , like blazing saddles , it is really good , it was nominated for 3 oscars ."
17176,"interesting , is that the one with lilly crystal ?"
17177,"blazing saddles is z me , brooks comey film in the 70s . the cowboy movie with billy crystal is city snickers and was filmed in the 90s ."
17178,"whoops , i so n't think ive seen the new brooks film . is it any good ?"
17179,"oh yeah it is a classic , but it is wacky or absurd style of comedy . if you do n't like that style , you will be angry that it got 3 nominations ."
17180,intersting . i do n't think those awards mean anything anyways .
17181,"you are kind of wish t , eminem mon more oscars than georges lucas , bill murray and leonardo decaprio combined ."
17182,"this is interesting . what did he win them for , do you kno w ?"
17183,"he did a movie . maybe he won one for that , but most of them would be for best song ."
17184,intresting . i was wondering if it was for 8 mile . anyways nice chatting with you !
17185,"you too , have a food afternoon ."
17186,hey are you going to watch teh academy awards this year ?
17187,probably not . i do n't have cable any the . are you ?
17188,"no i do n't have cable , and i do n't eve watch regular tv haha . usually i just check on who won though , are you going to check on that ? you ever watch movies at al"
17189,i drop n't usually check will probably see the winners on facebook . i like to watch movies wand tv shows on hulu or netflix . pretty cool taht the academy awards have been around since 1930 when it was broadcasted on the radio .
17190,"i think that 's pretty cool too . and their first tv broadcast was back in 1953 . it 's interesting hat they are the larges stand oddest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony , i wonder what other countries watch them ? maybe france or something does"
17191,have you seen the latest wonder woman movie ?
17192,"yes i saw that . it took place in our ; lcd war 1 , which is very unusual setting for movie i think . what did you love about i t ? personally i thought it was ok"
17193,"sounds interesting i have n't seen it , but i would like to . can gadot served two years as a soldier in the israel defense forces , i was surprised o learn ."
17194,"that is interesting . i think that all israeli citizens have to do that though . and yes , that movie is the highest grossing superhero origin movie , and also highest grossing world war one movie . they should make more or dwarf 1 movies i think"
17195,oh i did n't know that about israeli citizens . i agree about making more ww1 movies .
17196,"i guess in 2017 that was the year where are the top three most successful movies were all led by females , that makes sense though , that 's the year that star wars and beast and the beast and wonder woman all came rut"
17197,have you seen star wars or beauty and the beast ? i 've only seen beauty nd the beast .
17198,"i have seen both of those . i really hated the star wars movie . i thought they ruined luke skywalker . and i thought beauty and the beast was ok , i think that the just stole everything from the cartoon version , and it was almost exactly the same , except they made new additions that were not as good , what do you think ?"
17199,i thought it was just okay too . i was kind of disappointed with some of the special effects like the character of lumber did n't look right to me .
17200,yeah i agree with you he looks weird in the movie . it 's funny that gal gadot thought she was testing for the role of catwoman . that is a completely different role lo .
17201,"yeah that is not even close , haha ."
17202,"pretty funny how times have changed so un terms of female representation . the she was a member o 9th justice society , and that was back in 1941 , i guess they made her a secretary . definitely not na acceptable way to show where nowadays"
17203,yes times have changed for sure . pretty crazy that the sun scan produce energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500000 years .
17204,"that is impressive . i wish we could chances what somehow , that would really help save the planet i think . it 's all so crazy that the sun is actually white , you 're always fought in school that it 's yellow , but that 's because of our atmosphere"
17205,yeah that is cool . and it is only 1 billionth he size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy .
17206,"it seems small , but the sun is actually huge , the diameter is 110 times th eliza of earth , that 's crazy because the earth is already huge in my opinion haha"
17207,did you know that wonder woman is the top grossing super hero origin movie ? i did n't know that
17208,no . i would have guessed black panther . wonder woman is a dc character which i prefer to marvel .
17209,"see i like batman as my favorite overall superhero , s o h is dc , but i ca n't say i 'm a fan of the rest of the c characters , there seem too unbelievable , who are your favorite sc characters ?"
17210,i grew up with superman comics . such a powerful superhero makes the writers have to come up wth prepostereous villains though . it is interesting taht gal gadot was really a soldier for israel .
17211,"yes that definitely adds more legitimate to her character , but i do think every israeli is required by law to serve in the military , but that still is an interesting fact"
17212,"her firsts movie was batman , your guy , vs superman , my guy , in 2016 . she signed for 3 movies in her first contract which kept her price low ."
17213,"how i like that , your guys s my guy , he tid you thin too that movie ? i still like christopher fees as she best superman , superman can nd 2 are really good movies still , cant say i 'm too thrilled with the current superman movies"
17214,it was a watchable movie . i agree with reeve s superman . 2017 was the first team sine 1958 that the top 3 grossing domestic films ad a female lead .
17215,"ya that is shocking , you mentioned gal got , i guess when she auditioned for wonder woman she thought it was originally a try out for catwoman , which would cav been a much different movie haha"
17216,"whe nthe character was introduced to the justices are , they made her be oh secretary . that would not fl in th climate of political correctness o today ."
17217,"oh no not at all , it 's crazy how quickly times change , i also think its crazy tha wonde women was the highest grossing wwi movie , you do n't see too many movies based on that war"
17218,that is true . it is lso interesting that one of the producer was a chinese company . i suspect that eomheow helped thye film appear on more screens in china .
17219,"haha yes i definitely that thaat factored into it l do you liek daniel daylewis , i ca n't believe taht he won an oscar for best actor 3 times , that is crazy"
17220,he does that he does well . they have been giving oscars since 1929 . this year there will not be a host becaue of political correctness .
17221,"did they not pick a host now ? i know they changed it from kevin hart or something , i try not to read the news because it is too depressing and exhausting , i like random facts like how a lightening bolt is five times hotter han the surface of the sun haha"
17222,"no . they are going without a host . i can not conceived of a star one billion times as large a sour sun , yet one exists in our galaxy ."
17223,"what is wild too is that the sun makes enough every in one second to meet our planet ' a needs for 500 , 000 years , i do n't see how w epa n't capture some of that"
17224,surely future generations will get better . doing that . it is clearly the most important energy source in our solar system .
17225,"yes the future will definitely improve our technology , i think it 's wild that the sun is actually white , it 's just because of our atmosphere that it appears yellow in the sky"
17226,i agree . i though it was yellow because it was not as hot as aw hate star but is hotter than a red one . how about neptune only orbiting he sun once since it was discovered ?
17227,"yes that seems odd , i wonder if we will get to visit any of these distant planets in our lifetime , what do you think ?"
17228,"did you kow that dog 's have 12 different blood types , ad that they can donate blood at blood drives for dogs ?"
17229,no i didnt know that . i love dogs . best kind of helpers there are . very good for the disable . have you any experience with that kind of help from dogs ?
17230,"i have a dog , he 's not much of a physical help , but he 's emotional support . he keeps me company and always makes me laugh ."
17231,"thanks super sweet . i wonder hat a dog or any other kind of animal would do on a different plant . lets say mars . i know its a long ay , but still fun to think about"
17232,it would be weird if dogs ruled mars . that would be s concept .
17233,very weird . i know the atmosphere has alot to do with it . but still somone got to atleast put it in a movie so we can see it . heard about the 2013 plan for mars ?
17234,cha i heard that theres ' a colonization project planned for 2023 the will be funded by creating a reality tv show .
17235,now thats crazy ! they should bring dogs . . . they could make for better tc 3d dogs ar pretty intelligent .
17236,yeah they are . did you know that google prefers dogs to cats ? their code of conduct specifically states taht hey are a dog company . that makes me want to support them more .
17237,thats so cool to know . i know my dog also kinda acts like me at time . dogs just pick up n our behavior . i do wish they could pick up us talking lol
17238,"my dog is lazy like m e , like right now he 's just sitting in my chair with me . i wish my dog could talk sometimes just so i could know what he wanted instead of just staring it me ."
17239,"lol same . or if they could sing , when i do a music my dog barks in rhythm . any time i listen to bruno mars he loves it . . . . you like his music ?"
17240,"that 's awesome . me just looks at me weird when i sing . i do like music though , i 'm always listening to it ."
17241,i love how he writes some of the best songs . interesting to know he used o be with motown . love that label .
17242,"he 's very talented and he writes his own music , that speaks a lot for his talent ."
17243,"he started off as an elvis , which i have seen on youtube . very interesting to see . maye he will go to mars on that reality show ol"
17244,he could be the host of it !
17245,hahah totally ! and play all the music on hte planet .
17246,he coud wrestle people since he wasnt armed after professional wrestle bruno sammartino .
17247,"hahaha that would be entertaining too . dont forget about the dog , i ha to be there to trying to sing ad being a helped paw hand lol"
17248,neat would be epic ! it was nice chatting with you !
17249,hey there do you like dogs or cats more ? i 'm defintely a dogs person
17250,same here ! they are man 's best friend q
17251,"yep i agree ! and i have know that they had 12 different blood types , that 's crazy ! i think humans only have like five or six"
17252,isnt hat crazy ? dogs can also donate blood at dog blood drives . lol
17253,that 's interesting i hope they get a treat afterwards ! i think it 's crazy thought hat only two types of animals can understand human pointing and they are the elephant and the dog
17254,i agree ! i like ow google ks a dogg company and prefers dogs to cats . they even state in their code of conduct that they are a dog company .
17255,"that is pretty cool . ia lso like what istanbul is doing with their stray dogs , they are training them . pick up garbage and then they will get food once they deliver the garbage to the recycling center"
17256,that 's a great idea ! did you know that dogs are no color blind ? they just ca n't see as any different colors as humans .
17257,"no i dod n't know that . i wonder why people say that all the time . on a different note though , do you ever think about the planet mars ? it 's te re planet in our solar system"
17258,i do . it 's also the fourth planet from the sun and the second smallest planet in the solar system after mercury .
17259,yes you 're right . it 's also crazy that if you and i here there right now our voices would be higherpitched because of the difference in the atmosphere on mars vs . heart
17260,interesting ! lichens and cyanobacteria would be able to thrive on mars .
17261,"it i interestin . it 's also interesting that they are trying to plan a mars colonization ; inject that will be funded tv a reality show , i really want to see that !"
17262,that would be fun to watch . a satellite was lost on mar because locheed martin used the imperial system while nasa used the metric system .
17263,"haha tat is funny . i remember when that happened . it 's also crazy that if we woudl just travel at one unit of gravity acceleration then we could et to mars in 2 days , i hope we can do that in our , lifetime"
17264,that would be awesome ! do you know much about bruno mars ?
17265,in a little bit . i know that he was born in 1985 ad is very talented he writes his own music
17266,yes . he was signed and dropped by motown records years before becoming a success .
17267,"well that is cool . and he was also and after a professional wrestler , bruno sammartino"
17268,that is neat ! do you know how bruno mars started cout ?
17269,"yes i believe he started as a elvis impersonator and did n't even use his original na , e when he started doing live performances"
17270,what do you think about liberal arts degrees ? personally i donate in there is important as engineering degrees
17271,i agree . i dont think they are important as engineering degree . do you know much about artifical intelligence ?
17272,yeah i know a little bit . apparently there is a nonprofit organization that is constantly trying to advance i research
17273,yeah adn stanford has a class that uses google hangouts go help them teach more efficiently .
17274,yeah that ' pretty cool . i think it 's scary that facebook is developing an ai thouhg . if would be able to predict users actions and mentions
17275,"that is creepy , i have seen some youtube video on actual ai robots , they are weird ."
17276,"yeah i think a gun is creepy . it 's also crazy that there as an ai that scientists created who could beat humans at a puzzle game called 2048 , i do n't like that !"
17277,yeah theory is a huge theory that way in the future humans will be like pets of ai 's or raised in activity of the ai robots .
17278,"yeah tha would n't surprise me . it does surprise me though that thee stress from the twilight series , kristen stewart , actually authored a paper on artificial intelligence , i did n't see that coming lol"
17279,"oh wow , thats cool i guess . i hope she is better at writing ."
17280,"yes , i hope she 's good at writing . i do n't care for her acting , personally . do you ever read dany books by the way ? apparently the fda burned six tons of books a time point in an act of censorship"
17281,wow stats a big statement .
17282,"yeah i think it 's scary ; . i used to read a lot of books but not so much anymore , and i never knew that kissing in a romantic fashion is actually a recent development and was not present tin greek literature"
17283,me either ! that is interesting . i would like to see the contest were author some up with the worst opening sentence .
17284,"yeah i wonder what that would be haha . what do you think about winston churchill by the way ? apparently he won a nobel prize for literature not peace , but i know he was super important during world war ii so i wonder why that is"
17285,"i know h was the prime minister of england and they made a movie about it lol hats awesome , wow nobel prize !"
17286,"yes thats impressive ! i 'm shocked that architecture , literature , painting , and music were originally olympic events ! i wonder how they judged that ? it must just be very subjective"
17287,i feel liek olympics should be a physical competition . those subjects should be a different event lol
17288,haha yes i agree i you . are using a computer right now ? i know that i am and i find it scary that there are people that would upload tshirt brains to a computer ! what if you got a virus
17289,"wow that ia some sci fo stuff , have you ever seen that show black mirror ? well they have an episode on that it was keep . i would definitely be scared to so something like that l"
17290,"i have see that show . i do like it , have you head of the computer that one russians made ? apparently the made it a in 1936 and it can run on water , but anyway take rare was a great chat"
17291,winston churchill won a nobel peace prize for in literature not peace .
17292,"huh hat is interesting , i like wwi history it 's one of my hobbies , he played a very important role in that war"
17293,i was i had the patience for it . edgar a . poe received 9 for his poem the raven .
17294,"that is too bad that is a great poem , did you know that romantic kissing did n't always exist and is a recent invention"
17295,i did not hard to believe . did you know that there is a pop that when read is depressing but when read backward is inspiring .
17296,"no i di n't i want to see that poem , have you heard of the fantasy author terry pratchett ?"
17297,i have n't but id like to see that poem as well . you know if you publish a book in norway the government will purchase 1000 copies .
17298,"cook well at least yoy have guaranteed sales , anyway terry was knighted for his ' services to literature ' which is interesting i never heard of him"
17299,me either . there are more libraries in the us than there are micky d 's
17300,"well that is good t least , did you know there is a professor that teaches heavy metal as a form of literature , do n't know that . i dont ' like that and i like heavy metal"
17301,not me so much anymore . did you know the fda burn 6 ron of literature as an act of censorship .
17302,no i did n't m do you know why they burendtf he books ? that seems really weird
17303,they werent trying to censor something they did not want to get out i 'm assuming .
17304,"ah i see , what i do think is crazy is that art , music , and poetry were olympic sports back in the day"
17305,poetry as a history being back to prehistorical times . creations like hunting poetry in africa
17306,"that is crazy , and apparently the vikings were warriorpoets , they filed people add soso wrote poetry"
17307,javanese alphabet when recited in order forms a poem
17308,"interesting i wonder what it says , do you lie tupac ? apparently he studied poetry in school"
17309,i was a big fan i my younger years . i do believe he tried himself on using a poet .
17310,"ya i think so , i never listened to his music personally , i did watch lord of the rings sand apparently tolkien would laugh at bad poetry with his friends"
17311,"interesting . well it was nice talking with you , enjoy the rest of the day ."
17312,"great you too , make sure to check cout some poetry like the 274 line poem called ' the chaos '"
17313,i love to read especially fiction . do you feel the same ?
17314,"i am an avid reader , does of mine is i noon friction , but i occasionally dabble in thas fiction realm"
17315,did york now thay romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and it is rarely mentioned in old literature ?
17316,"do , i kind o expected at to be a thing that has been around for a while , in the literature realm at least"
17317,me too . i wonder why it was not really a practice a lot time ago . how do you eels about censorship i literature ?
17318,"i think it is horrible , especially the burning of literature . such a waste"
17319,i agree l i ma totally against censorship . the fda burned six tons f literature in an act of censorship in the us . that 's devastating to me .
17320,"ia free , especially for something that actually was once an olympic event , you think it would be valued more"
17321,literature was an olympic event ? ! that 's so strange . i do n't even know how taht would work .
17322,"along with music , sculpture , painting and architecture in both 1912 and 1932 . im not sure how you compete in those , but im all fir the arts"
17323,i 'm for it to but im also curious how yiu would compete . dod you know that poe only received 9 for the publication of the raven ? thats ' so sad that his genius was not credited until after his death .
17324,"that must have been frustrating for him . he is such an iconic poet now , too bad his tallest was n't recognized when he was alive ."
17325,i agree . did you know that churchill won a nobel prize for literature but not one for peace ?
17326,"i always thought his prize was for peace , that is really interesting ."
17327,it is very unexpected . i do n't get there much anymore but i used to go to the library a lot . ow about you ?
17328,"8 havent been in forever . i usually just buy books now , i really shoudl go back and check it cut . i think it is cool that sacramento has al library of things tha people can check out that they need briefly but not long term ."
17329,that is an amazing idea . i wish i had access to a place like that . i am very glad that there are still more libraries in the us than mcdonald 's . we need to keep libraries protected .
17330,"we really do , we need support for literature too like in norway were if you publish a book , the government will of 1000 copies to put them in libraries ."
17331,that 's a fantastic idea also . it 's good for the writer and the library . i am also glad hat half of adults still have library cards . i actually just went and got mine renewed yesterday . you can do so much with the now . mine even had audiobook so can access online .
17332,really ? i should definitely check in to that . that would be cheaper than using audible . i remember in college using the mircoform machines to read articles .
17333,way cheaper . i 've never actually used one of those machines but j know we used to have them .
17334,"what do you think is a more important degree , liberal cats or engineering ?"
17335,"i think both have their place . i 'm a science person myself , with a degree in chemistry , but i can totally appreciate studying more artistic things . how about you ?"
17336,"yes i have an engineering degree , personally i think engineering is much more important than liberal arts , anyone can learn al liberal arts degree but that 's just my opinion ."
17337,"yah k agree that engineering is far more complex , but i still think that liberal arts are important . maybe not to get a dog , so it might be a waste of money to pursue that kind of regret e , but the subject itself is worthwhile in my opinion . do you kow much about ai ?"
17338,i know a little bit bout it . i think there is a nonprofit organization actually that is responsible for promoting development of artificial intelligence
17339,that 's really cool ! i read that facebook ai developing an artificial intelligence that can understand human emotions an predict behavior . kind of crazy !
17340,"wow that is crazy ! i like stanford 's idea though , they are using artificial intelligence to help to teach students more efficiently with google hangouts"
17341,i think that 's great ! it makes classes to much more accessible to people . it you know kristen stewart coauthored an artificial intelligence paper ? i ponder hoe that turned out . . .
17342,"wow i didn ' know that was interested in artificial intelligence k , did yu know that artificial intelligence can crush all human records in puzzlesolving"
17343,"yeah i read that they beat all of the record for the game ' 2048 ' , but i 'm not familiar with that game are you ?"
17344,"no i 've never played that game before , but i sounds very complex , do you read any books on artificial intelligence by the way"
17345,i never have ! honestly its not something i now much about . have you read on the subject ?
17346,"no i have n't reads bout artificial intelligence but i do you like to read on occasion , i even found doug recently taht romantic kissing s a recent invention and that they did not kiss each other back in the ancient greeks time"
17347,i react hat to ! i also enjoy reading apparently literature used to be an olympic event . i wonder how that worked ?
17348,"it is a great question , it 's also a real question o why the fda burned six tons of literature m thats rounds like censorship t me"
17349,"thats an insane amount of censorship , do you know when that happened ?"
17350,"nl i do n't know when or why bug it sounds very dubious to me , w hat do you think about winston churchill winning the nba peace prize ?"
17351,i was really surprised to find that he won for literature and not peace 2 did you know that there is a contest every year where writers compete to come up with the worst opening sentence to a novel ?
17352,"no i 've never heard about that , do they use computers when they 're writing ? apparently there are people called transhumanists how o upload their souls into computers"
17353,. . . no way ? that 's insane ! i 've never heard of that before . i wonder how they think they 'll do that ? i think i remember seeing a johnny depp movie where he did something like that lol
17354,"yeah i think i saw that movie too , i also want o see a movie about the russian computer that runs on water , they invented it back in 1936"
17355,"hi , do you ever get a chance to go to the library ?"
17356,"i do on occasion . i really want to check out that library in sacramento that allows patrons to check out more than just books , stuff that 's useful but also stuff we do n't want to own in the long run . what about you ?"
17357,a tool library is a great idea . it makes life so much easier for people that do n't affords ome basic tools . i do n't usually get tp the library much . i do research online .
17358,i understand ! but luckily there re ore libraries than there are mcdonald ' store in the united states ! plus half the adult population owns library cards ! that gives me a little hope ! ha !
17359,"if they could combine the two , it would be great ! he the books for the mind , and food for the big belly ! a happy combo !"
17360,"that is a great idea ! ha ! never considered that ! so are you also a fan of poetry bic have ? i personally love that one poem that is depressing when you 're i , but inspiring when you read it backwards !"
17361,i never heard of that poem . i guess it must be famous . never read it in school . i wonder who wrote it . i do n't know much about poetry .
17362,"it 's very interesting . i highly recommend it to you ! if you 're a fan of the hobbit , nearly if the character names were taken from an icelandic poem called dvergatal ."
17363,"tolkien loved language , so i 'm not surprised that he took names fro obscure sources . he wrote the lotr series because he could create language for the different races ."
17364,"that 's pretty interesting ! hey , even the javanese alphabet actually forms a poem when it 's recited i border ! that is amazing !"
17365,"i guess it 's not like the abc song , which i just letters . language is fascinating . i 'm shocked that edgar allan poe only received 9 for hte publication of his poem , ' the raven . '"
17366,that is shocking considering how legendary it is today . he was ripped off ! wondr if demetri martin received much for the 224 word palindrome poem he wrote ?
17367,"a palindrome that long , must have taken year to write . how did he do it ? did he win ana ward ? i hope so ."
17368,"i hope so as well ! but all in all , i 'm a fan of literature in general ; it ' crazy to think winston churchill lion a nobel prize for literature and not peace back in 1953 ."
17369,i would expect churchill to have won for something else like peace because eh tried so hard to end war and help the world . i guess he wrote a good memoir or something ? i do n't know .
17370,i suppose so but you do make a great point there ! can you also believe the fda once burned six tons of literature in an act of us censorship ? that is unbelievable and ridiculous !
17371,i guest hey thought they were ehelpign te country and its morality . silly . too many books got banned . i think it 's part of freedom of speech to read what you want .
17372,"exaclty ! heck , even literature along with architecture , gaining , music , etc . were all olympic events up nunti 1942 !"
17373,"i find that strange ep hew are those things athletic ? there should be contest s , but in a different real . not spots ."
17374,"i suppose that 's why they got rid of them . but in a humorous note , there 's actually a contest that challenge writers to come up with horrible opening sentences for novels . i 'd live to see some of the examples . ha !"
17375,"ah , yes , i 've heard of that contest . ' it was a dark and stormy night . ' yes , lots of fun . anyway , it was fun chatting !"
17376,ha ! ca n't imagine what it would have been ike without romantic kissing since it 's a fairly new development and is hardly found in ancient greek literature ! it was great chatting with you as well . take care !
17377,are you into artificial intelligence ?
17378,"not really . it 's interesting , though . are you ?"
17379,i lol it . a lot of people are afraid that it may take over and take jos away .
17380,"yeah , people are afraid for sure . personally , i think it could only make the world better"
17381,it is already making a huge impact on everyday life by helping us do things we do everyday like communicate
17382,no doubt . as time goes by it scan do many things for us . roof carrers are coming in britain
17383,that will bee xtreemly beneficial to the world . automated cars will be of great value too
17384,i totally agree . humans drivers are dangerous ! no more drunk driving . no more texting and driving ! imagine all the lives tha will be saved .
17385,the car i have now . essentially automated
17386,"awesome ! ai could allow people to focus on things that a machine could never do . like being creative , for instance"
17387,ai wise oven present in medicine now days . some surgeries can be done witht the assistance of ai and doctor supervision
17388,"a machine will not accidently leave something i na patient . machines have no empathy , s o the doctor 's role will not go away"
17389,i think you are right . i am curious to see how art and music integrated ai
17390,"yeah , no doubt . ai may assist with the recording of music , replacing the sound engineer maybe . it 'll be interesting to see"
17391,many of the large tech executives have degrees n humanity send english and not science alike you might think
17392,taft actually does not surprise me . those subjects can help you gain insight that engineering ca n't . i think both are important to study
17393,as computer shave advanced so to has ai .
17394,i did n't know that a woman wrote the first algorithm .
17395,pretty amazing for sure . the space shuttle runs off of a relatively small computer and the russians have one that runs on water
17396,"kristen stewart cowrote an paper about ai , i had no idea"
17397,one of the first published papers i believe .
17398,hello . do you know much about ai ?
17399,"not much , terminator taught me to be fearful of ai !"
17400,i am not sure what i think of machines mimicking human sad makes me nervous !
17401,"a machine learning and problem solving is scary , and they even getting smarter ."
17402,i know . honestly the idea of autonomous operating cars scares me most .
17403,even scarier tha self driving cars i the fact that actress kristen stewart coauthored a paper o nazi .
17404,"funny . i suess facbook is also getting in on the action by developing ah ai that understands emotions , predicts actions , and identifies objects in photos ."
17405,"i wondr what the purpose of hat is . ai just crushes human intelligence , in the game 2048 it beat the game in only 3 moves ."
17406,not sure but store is a non profit organization tat is working on ore advancement of ai .
17407,stanford uses google plus hangouts to welp teach artificial intelligence glass .
17408,i think i will stick to computers for now .
17409,"we are very lucky to have computers , devices that carry out sequences f arithmetic or logical operations ."
17410,it 's cool that someone built a computer using nothing but minecraft building blocks
17411,"i want to know where the water run computer isp , russians made one in 1936 ."
17412,there are so many programs nowadays too for computers .
17413,"and then you ave the people that want to upload their consciousness to computers , winder if that essentially makes them a program ."
17414,"probably , sounds insane tom e . also insane to think that if you smoke near an apple computer you void the warranty ."
17415,"yes , wonder what makes it a biohazard after that . all those old engineers and programmers used to smoke like chimneys ."
17416,n doubt ! did you know the space shuttle 's regular compute reruns on only 1m how am .
17417,"that seems impossible , so much has to be ran on that computer ."

17448,olive munin posted costumes gov her dressing up as people whom she admires . that 's pretty cool .
17449,"aww , that 's sweet . i think justin timberlake is kid of sneak because he dressed up like th lego batman and was able to concept ; his complete identity . he would walk around with his kids unnoticed ."
17450,"yeah , that is cool he got to go trick or treating with them ."
17451,"i like how some celebrities , ike johnny depp , use his costume to make surprise visits to hospitals to see sick kids . he wears his jack sparrow sometimes ."

17453,i know i would how to see that ! what a great work environment and atmosphere . how fun would that be . i have heard that some costumes hasve been lost in in transit when flying too .

17466,"he was terrified of bambi ? goodness he mutt truly have a twisted view on things . ha ! meanwhile , apparently not a single person on the exorcist chew thought it would be considered a horror movie during filming . what is wrong with people ? ha !"
17467,"right ! i do n't get that at all . i can , that movie was just gross ."
17468,agreed ! it certainly was . so did you ever see inception ? chris nolan actually wanted if to be a horror film initially but it evolved into a heist film instead . wonder what that would have been like ?

17476,"it was a great show , was n't it ? so do you also watch the academy awards ? i always wish i could hasve seem the oscar walt disney won back in 1930 or snow white . that oscar he received was special because if had seven miniature statues along with a regular sized statute ! that ; s hilarious !"
17477,"yes , it certainly was ! i get the award shows confused . i knw the 90th aa were in 2017 though ."
17478,did you also know only walt disney has been nominated for more scars has john williams ?
17479,"no , i did not know that . i can imagine why walt had so many though . what a great imagination brought to life !"
17480,"that is so true ! i also think lady gaga has a great imagination as well ! speaking of lady gaga , did you now she was actually on the mtv show boiling point before she became famous ?"

17545,"yes i agree ! but honestly , one of the on ; lyre season i watched boss baby was because it had alec baldwin in it . . . maybe thay idea works !"

17573,do you like to wear costumes ?
17574,"i like coming up with costumes for halloween and wearing them oh that was , or whenever the halloween parties are , , but i dont ' get super wild about it like herd alum or beyonce or celebs like that . i keep it a little more low key . he about yiu ?"
17575,"i love costumes as well , halloween is one of my favorite days in the year , panda research were costumes everyday , panda costumes"
17576,"yea i think that 's hilarious . i ' sure it 's to keep the actual pandas calm or whatever , but it seem so silly , sipping your coffee on threw ay into the office . . . wearing a panda costume ."
17577,"i gues sits part of a normal routine to them , johnny depp also likes to wear costumes to need kids in hospitals"
17578,"that 's really sweet when celebrities do stuff like that . depp is not my fav , but i give him credit for that . i also like it when celebs like justin timberlake get so dressed up they are n't recognizable and single in with normal foil ; ks who have no idea bathe celeb is there ."
17579,"gives even some sketches , one of maroon 5 they where in disguise and started playing then people realized it was them and the crowd grew at an accelerated rate"
17580,"it 's like costumes lady an important role in society . . . as in , thet can be a cultural thing , but also a way to connect to others . i think one of my favorite instances of this is when kyrie irving the basketball player dressed up as an old man and went to a public court to play . he scored everyone and it was really funny ."
17581,"i didnt hear about taht one but it does sound funny lo , do you know who kim kardashian is ?"
17582,"yes , i do . i do n't really pay attention to her , though i was happy to learn she 's advocating for victims of armenian genocide . what do you think about her ?"
17583,"i think she 's had a lot of controversies over the years ,"
17584,"yea i think she 's beautiful , but in that l . a . wealthyplastic surgery kind of way that is n't so great . did you ever watch her reality show ? i watched parts of an episode or two , but i mostly avoided it ."
17585,"i did , i did n't really like it i think she gives a terrible example tot teens"
17586,"yea , 8 remember the ray j thing . i wonder if that was a coordinated pulbifcity stunt , or if she just turned it in her favor , or if it was actually a traumatic thing for her but people ender up paying more attention to her anyway ? in any case , th whole thing was less than hwolesoms . . ."
17587,"celebrities tend to bring a lot of drama to our life s , they learn a lot of money too just like judge judy , she makes about 123000 per episode"
17588,"yes hes ' paid a lot to get into people 's faces a bit ! i ca n't believe she 's second to lebron james as far as her income goes . 9 'd , ike tos lee thru plays one on the court though ."
17589,"that would be interesting indeed , lebron has an unfair advantage though , did you ear about pixar secret room ?"
17590,i di d ! i wonder what 's so secret about it ? o know that pixar often includes the number ' 113 ' in their movies because it 's a reference to the original office they did their work in or something . do you have a favorite pixar movie ?
17591,"not really a can be , i just cant recall one right now , was aladdin a pixar movie ? r okie williams nailed it by performing aladdins voice"
17592,"i do n't think that was , i think it was a disney movie before they bought pixar . that was a nice movie , and robin williams was great . i heard will smith is going to play that same role , and apparently people are up in arms about that . not sure why though ."
17593,"i hope will smith is us for the role , he is a great actor but robin williams was just that , sad how things ended for him though"
17594,do you like computers ?
17595,"i love my laptop , i ca n't leave home without it . how about you"
17596,m tou . did you know the space shuttle only runs on mb of ram ?
17597,"i did not know that ! is that a lot or a little , i never know size"
17598,that is not a lot . i think my computer might have more .
17599,"ha nice , i am sure mine does too , it is rather ew . did you know captcha i an angry m ?"
17600,"no , i did n't know that . did you know you could build a 16 bit computer using minecraft building blocks ?"
17601,"ha wow i did not know that , i will have to try it just . i will have to read about it , do you read much ?"
17602,i read a little bit . what about transhumanists ?
17603,"what is that , i never heard of transhumanists ?"
17604,it is the you upload you remind to a computer and memory sticks .
17605,"h aww w , that is some interesting science ! i like reading bout romantic kissing sometimes , that did n't exist in ancient greece"
17606,interesting . i did n't know that . did you know kim an un has a degree in physics ?
17607,i wonder where he got it from lol . the univerity of kim jung un ? lol
17608,"i think they sent him abroad when he was younger , but i 'm not sure ."
17609,i think you 're right . if i remember right it was switzerland or something . i like learning about physics . do you ?
17610,"interesting . no , i 'm not a physics fan . but i know that chinese dye may sad to breakthrough in quantum physics ."
17611,i remember i got to go go an amusement park in high school because of physics . i defintely did n't study quantum physics or help the cause
17612,did you know smoking near an apple computer voids its warranty ?
17613,"han o way , i am sure it discovers it also ! did you know windows 95 was second most downloaded software after 'the game doom , interesting ."
17614,i can believe it . that game was popular . nice chatting with you .
17615,"hello , do you enjoy reading literature ?"
17616,"yes , sometimes . i would have liked to have been what the fda burned ."
17617,i know isn ' tthat terrible ! did you know winston churchill won a nobel prize for literature ?
17618,i did not . i knew he had the ' it of gab ' but not writing . i ca n't believe that romantic kissing is a recent development and the ancient greeks did n't reference it much . i thought they were a bit more glamorous than that .
17619,"lol , what ? really , i did too . that surprises me . would that be for religious seasons ?"
17620,i do n't think so . have you seen their fullfrontq sculptures ?
17621,"yes , i have . did you know the olympics use to have sculpture as an event from 1912 to 1952 ?"
17622,"yes , along with architecture and others things . wild that there is a annual literature contest for writers for who can write the worms possible opening sentence to a novel . i may be able to win that . . ."
17623,"lol , really , that would be interesting ! ! at least that is something different !"
17624,"wow , i read recently that the russians built a computer in 1936 that ran of water !"
17625,"wow , that 's really inventive ! i would like to see that . gosh , do n't get any smoke near your apple computer it voids the warranty !"
17626,i heard of that . crazy that they think it would become a biohazard .
17627,"ha , ha , ha ! ! i know . . . . . i wonder if candle smoke woulda o the same ?"
17628,they would have other ' environmental ' concerns over that it interesting that ' transhumanists ' want to upload their minds to memory devices . does that mean that stupid people would require a miller thumbdrive ?
17629,"lol , could be . especially if they do n't have good memory !"
17630,kim jongun has a degree n physics ?
17631,"i was thinking the same thing , or just gave it to him . you have to have a smart mind for that ! ! lol omg can 'you believe pixar spent 3 years studying the physics of curly game for the movie brave ?"
17632,now that 's some dumb research . . . did you hear taht there is some uppi56 hs in scarsdale ng that thinks ap classes are n't good enough o theyd developed their own ?
17633,yeah ! its the only public school in the country that has dropped it . crazy !
17634,"yes , ans many were afraid the schools would follow butt they did n't ."
17635,"i know , they wanted their own homegrown college level courses ! ! good chat ! !"
17636,"leah , 30 percent were kept out and it would n't be standardized so . . . stupid . yes , thanks , you the great !"
17637,hey there . did you take any ap passes in high school ? cuz i hear they 're replacing them in some schools now .
17638,"i took a few . . . i think . it 's been so long since high school it 's hard to remember . ha ! yeah , i think i heard about that , they 're replacing them with at courses . . . dunno , might be a good idea , what d you think ?"
17639,it seems like they 'd work in private and prestigious schools like georgetown day is going . but i do n't think they 'd work out in general . ow about you ?
17640,"i really do n't know , i think it depends on the quality of the teacher sand the dedication of the students . some people say with the right teacher , a mediocre student can really shine , but with some students . . . , scruggs ,"
17641,you do have a point were . i 've heard that at teachers have great reputation so far . so your optimism may be justified haha .
17642,"yeah , i heard one of the courses thay offered was in computer technology . speaking of computers , did you know the russians aide a computer tat ran on water '"
17643,"what ? really ? that 's insane ! but then again i work on designing quantum computers so i 've seen some weird stuff myself haha . physics is weird in general , do n't you think ?"
17644,"you work on quantum computers ? ? for real ? that is awesome ! but yeah , physics is pretty weird . i ' told kim jongun has z degree in physics . i wonder if it 's earned or ' honorary ' . . ."
17645,"oh he earned it , just like how he invented basketball ! i wonder if they 'll offer any quantum computing courses through ap or at in the future . do you think highschoolers would like writing 15 page research papers for that like they do for at already ?"
17646,"depends on the high school student , i guess . i could n't relaly see writing 15 pages on about anything these days . lol . speaking of physics , they say pixar studied the physics of curly hair for the years . can you believe it ?"
17647,"oh i believe it , that stuff gets real complicated real fast . solving complicated partial diferential equation should 04 an olympic sport , just like literature and music once were !"
17648,"ish had one guy got a degree in theoretical physics when hew as only 20 years old . now , that 's got ta be once smart ella !"
17649,indeed my dud of how many ap tests do you think he took ? do you think they 'd ever exclude him from at classes like that school in sxarsdaqle does ?
17650,no idea . i have a better question . . . do you think he ' dan to be a transhumanist and upload his brain into a computer ? that would be pretty wild !
17651,i know i would ! hopefully my research can help make that a reality one day . then i 'll play your brain to !
17652,hmm . . dunno if i 'd want my brain uploaded . sounds a bit on the creepy side . . . i know we could n't do it on a space shuttle computer though . it only had 1mb ifr ram ! can you believe it ?
17653,"crazy how much computers have evolved , huh ? now your smartphone can download the entice history of western literature and still have space to spare 2"
17654,literature is another neat subject . . did you know there 's an annual challenge for writers to com up with the worst possible opening to a novel ? i find that hilarious !
17655,that sounds like fun to me haah . do you think kissing will ever be phased ou you literature ? i know hat 's one a modern thing .
17656,"no , i think it 's pretty much here to stay , as long as there ' romance novels m which do n't seem to be slowing down anytime soon . ,"
17657,"ah , that 's too bad haha . but unlike romances novels , i ca n't stay myself . but i had nice chat and i hope you have a nice day . goodbye !"
17658,did you know thay he fda has burned six tons of literature in the sake of us censorship ?
17659,do we know what theme had those books ?
17660,8 'm not sure . but there is an annual literature contest for literature with the worst opening sentences
17661,"now thats something i would love to see an example of ! ; ,"
17662,interestingly l the space shuttle 's general purpose computer only ran on 1b of rake
17663,to do what . . . keep the text foles ?
17664,"i do n't know , but doesnt sound likd a lof of memory . in 1936 russians made a compute that ran on water . i wish i could do that if i could save monroe and recycle threw alter ."
17665,"was on water . . . was it liek a cyborg jesus ? : ,"
17666,do n't make near an apple computer o brit will void the warranty making it z biohazard
17667,"i don ' believe that . . . ? how would they know ? : k ,"
17668,maybe he smell ?
17669,"what , when you go to the service depp t , thet can smell if somebody was smoking close to it ? ; ,"
17670,"somebody made up the rule , s o there has to be some test : , pixar spent tree years studying physics of curly hair to correctly render merida 's hair in ' brave '"
17671,"now that 's interesting . i wonder if that research helo ; ed creating nadia hairworks technology : ,"
17672,could be ! they think that an ancient chinese dye used on th terra cotta army may lead to quantum physics breakthroughs . wonder how ?
17673,terra cotta army ? what is that ?
17674,i believe that was hte large statue army that was uncovered in china . you can look it up it is amazing !
17675,what . . . how does this has anything to do with quantum physics . . .
17676,"i have no idea , but the statue army is really really cool looking and a great archaeological find . people think the universe could have come from nothing without violating physics . don ' quite understand that either ."
17677,come from nothing ? in physics nothing comes from nothing . . .
17678,i do n't even know what that implies nothing rom nothing . in 1953 sir winston churchill won a nobel prize in literature not peace
17679,"he fought fo 'the peace : , it 's kind of a paradox : , lol , maybe that 's why : ,"
17680,"could be . interestingly architecture , literature , music , painting and sculpture were olympic events from 1912 to 1952 ."
17681,"i love apple products , and was surprised to learn that smoking near them violates the warranty , as it is supspkdedly a ' bio hazard '"
17682,captcha is an acronym for ' completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart '
17683,"yes , i knew this . i like ' c captcha ' better . what do you think of those people who want to u ; load their minds to computers ?"
17684,i think they are losing their minds . . . ha !
17685,just like the person who built a working computer out of minecraft building blocks . that was weird too .
17686,yeah . he really has something to build on though . l . the first google computer at stanford was housed im custommade enclosures constructed from lego brakes
17687,"that 's crazy . the again , the russians made one that ran for water , back in 1975"
17688,the firt computer algorithm was written by a woman unnamed ada lovelace . might not be nominated but they got the algorithm . . .
17689,i recently found out waht literature an painting were once olympic events .
17690,i did not know that . . . comedic fantasy author terry pratchett was knighted for his ' services to literature ' .
17691,"i 've never heard of him , but i do know that winston churchill won a nobel prize in literature ."
17692,wait . . . you 've never heard of winston churchill ? ? ? ?
17693,terry pratchett i the one whom i 've never heard of . i 'm wellversed in the writings of churchill .
17694,whew ! i was going to be a little bigger with the educating system !
17695,"lol . it 's the fda we ave to the worried about , the like to burn literature ."
17696,haha . . . the hubble telescope discovered a galaxy so big that it should n't exist according to modern physics . who knew !
17697,i love looking at the images that the hubble sent gave . it 's fascinating that pixar spent three years studying curly hair .
17698,"that 's interesting . turbulence is one of physics great mysteries , and va gogh could accurately depict it in some of his paintings . i hate it on planes though . . ."
17699,"i feel the same . van gogh was very interesting . i did n't know that kim jongun u that a degree in physics , thats surprising"
17700,from where though ? is it like one of our honorary ones ?
17701,"i dont now . i dont now much abou they . maybe china , as the terra cotta army may lead scholars to a breakthrough in quantum physics ."
17702,nice chatting with you !
17703,good morning ! how are you ?
17704,"helo tore , i am well thank you . how about you ? do you like to read much ?"
17705,"i'n well too ! i do like to read , how about you ?"
17706,"yeah i do , but do n't do it as much as i would like to . did you know there are more libraries than mcdonalds in the s ?"
17707,that 's a great fact to hear ! you would think mcdonalds outnumber sever4ytthing case in this country haha l .
17708,"yah i was quite surprised by that fact , i woul have thought it was the other way around ."
17709,can you believe at some point the fda burned six tons of literature in an act of us censorship ?
17710,that is crazy ! it sound like a real life version of that book fahrenheit 455 !
17711,well saw ! i 'm glad we got away from that to of nonsense ! did you know winston churchill won a nobel prize ?
17712,"i did n't know that , do you know what he won it for ?"
17713,"he won it for literature surprisingly , and not peace !"
17714,"that is awesome ! i know back in 1895 , uk pm william gladstone founded a public library an diy age 85 , he wheelbarrowed his personal collection of 32 , 000 books almost a mile to he library from his home !"
17715,"dang i wonder how many types he took moving a , l of thos !"
17716,"that is a good point , 32 , 000 books sounds like a heck of a lot of wheelbarrow runs !"
17717,"it doe s ! if i release a book , i 'm going to do it in norway because you 're bound to sell at least 1000 copies haha ."
17718,"neat is pretty wild , the government stepping in and buying them to distribute to libraries around the country , c wool ."
17719,super cool ! do you ride horses at all ?
17720,"i do n't , but think they are really impressive , i have an aunt who does . how about you ?"
17721,i do n't but have an aunt also lol . did you see two high school kids got suspended for riding their horses to school ?
17722,"lol k yeah i think i read about that , sounds ike they he doing what they were supposed o by not riding a motorized vehicle ."
17723,"smart in my book ! well anyways , great chat , hve an awesome , e day !"
17724,"hi turner , do you spend much time in the library ?"
17725,not any more but i used to . i do like knowing that in norway the government wall buy copies your do that you publish and put them in libraries . it sounds like they really support theirs libraries .
17726,i did n't know that until recently . i was a big fan of the library .
17727,did you know that our own fda burst six tons of literature calling it censorship ?
17728,"i heard that information once , but i hnavenb't read much about it ."
17729,it makes you wonder what all was lost . libraries are definitely important . ;
17730,"yes it is , how do you get most of your information from since you no longer go to the library , from the computer ?"
17731,i 've never though about it but i guess i do . how about you ?
17732,"i get almost all my information from the computer , but it is putting a strain on my eyes ."
17733,i know that you mean there . books do n't put as much a strain as computers do .
17734,can you imagine being falsely imprisoned for 10 years and spend most of the time at a library trying to prove your innocence ?
17735,no but it is very admirable of teh person to do so .
17736,"you are right , i guess there is no limits whine it comes to being free especially if they are innocence ."
17737,"hey , what do you think of horses ? an interesting fact about them is that those lipizzaner horses are actually born black or brown and take about 6 years to turn white !"
17738,"wow , that amazing , i love horses and was raised on a farm . i learned to ride them when i was all ."
17739,me too . to this day i still find them fascinating !
17740,"yes i do , i do n't like when horses are being raced fir years and if they do n't win races , they put them away most of the time , if you kno what i am saying ."
17741,i do and i agree . i do n't like to se the shipped either .
17742,"i went to a , ive race track , the horse and jockey fell ."
17743,wa 'the horse okay .
17744,"yes and no , because the horse had a slight limp . the jockey was okay ."
17745,i certainly hope they gave you horse a chance to heel .
17746,are you a fan of soccer ?
17747,yes . the foot ball world cup simply called as fifa world cup . it i sinternationla competition contested by the senior men 's team .
17748,yes ! the city which is set to host 'the 2022 qatar fifa world cup final does not exist yet . how does that york ?
17749,th 121 world cup tournaments were won 8 teams . the world cup is most prestigious tournament in the world . all the nation in the world want to lift the fifa trophy .
17750,yes ! t eh hungary national team only had 1 defeat between 1950 and 1956 and that was the world cup final ! what are the odds ?
17751,us1 got 3rd place in the first fifa wold cup ink 1930 . teh american team has never placed below third place in the world cup since women world cup started in 1991 !
17752,i 'm betting on third place finishes from now on . lol did you know that there are no net economic gains for the countries that have played hosted to the olympics or hte world cup ?
17753,"already 17 countries hosted the footbal world cup , qatar has planned to hosts 2022 finals , 226 will jokingly hosted by canada , us and mexico ."
17754,"nice ! hte current champion is france , who won on the 2018 fifa world cup on july 11th h ."
17755,after 1908 summer olympics in london football became official competitions .
17756,"i did n't know taht . atl the 2014 world cup , there were more french born players playing against france than for it ."
17757,i ties very sd . very different to handle this situation .
17758,"lol if the algerian team had beaten germany in their last world cup game , they would have gone on to play france on teh exact date of the french invasion of nigeria 's capita , on july 4 , 800 . ironic ."
17759,german goalkeeper harold schumacher onlline with french defender patrick batgiston 83 the 182 world cup semifinals k all thur player are very aggressive to win the trophy for the nation .
17760,"wow ! did you know the soccer makes more money that football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis , and hockey combined ?"
17761,yeah . it has record f highest attendance to watch the game .
17762,nice . americans call i soccer because it was slang for association football !
17763,soccer is az tea sport played with a spherical ball between two team of eleven players .
17764,did you hear of the soccer variation where 3 teams face each other at the same time ? its even fun chatting .
17765,yeah jv very nice chatting with you . have a great day .
17766,you have a great day too !
17767,hello
17768,hi . have you heard the nes in olympics ? its been 114 years since someone ahs won a old medal
17769,"yes sure , do you know ledecka , primarily a snowboard , who won he women 's superb on skies"
17770,"yes and he eleven competed in 2 different sports although most people think that skiing nd snowboarding are the same , they are quite different"
17771,"here are dozens of athletes who compete in complimentary disciplines of the same for such as lololol jones , w to i like a lot"
17772,ive read that in todays modern times that most athletes simply part get the time to master two sports so its exciting when that happened
17773,"and also , and historically , national teams used athletes from sports that involved similar skillsets such as swimmers who play water polo or pentathletes who are also shooters , swimmers , fences , runners and equestrian to save money or because teams lacked a depth of talent , do you agree ?"
17774,i agree it is a wise idea to use the same athlete but what about the guy flack that tried to run the marathon an passed out while int he lead
17775,"ye that is for sure , there simply is n't enough time in the day for modern elite athletes to master two sports . to the layperson , skiing and snowboarding look pretty similar"
17776,"on the topic of sports , did you know that soccer makes more money combined than even football and other sports . wow"
17777,he i know cause i adore soccer lol . day you know the lyndon won a bronx medal as a welterweight boxer in the 104 st . louis games and a silver medal in soccer .
17778,you like soccer and i like the gymnastics which i thin his one of the older sports stat even greeks in ancient times practiced gymnastics to ready fo war . thats interesting
17779,"wow cool , i like gymnastics too . ad do you now anything about association football ?"
17780,i know association football is extremely popular as if is played in over 200 countries and i know tht american call it soccer which os slang for association football
17781,"and also there exists a variation of soccer where 3 teams face each other at the time time , its very interesting"
17782,"3 teams , that is unique . the story of a german soccer player who won the world cup and paid for 2 children in brazil to have surgeries is an amazing story ."
17783,yes adn do you love tennis ?
17784,i do like tennis . a fun fact about tennis is that polo shirts were invented because of tennis . a famous player rene lacoste created the and later wa adopted by polo players
17785,a black man won the 1st us open tennis title in 1968 and no black man has won it since .
17786,icy think that wa arthur ashe if i am not mistaken . i was surprised to ; earn that the longest tennis match in history was over 10 hours long and lasted 3d also ! i bet those players were tired
17787,ye si agree with you totally
17788,"the game that most of the world calls football , bu the us calls soccer is player on a pitch ."
17789,what do you mean by plays on a pitch ? i do liek association football aka soccer hhaa what about you ?
17790,that i that the field is called . it is rectangular and has a goal at each end . ;
17791,"i se now . i did know that you scare by shooting teh ball into the goal . what 's crazy to me is that soccer makes more money than football , basketball , tennis , nad all other sports combined"
17792,i know . lots of people ; lay it . ever 250 million in the world . i coached it when my daughter was young .
17793,oh that 's cool . i used to play when i was a kid . interesting why americans call it soccer . i guess that 's because its slang for association football
17794,we already had a sport called football . jon stewart actually represented the us in the day am games in brazil in 1983 playing soccer
17795,i did know that . did you ever watch film in the daily show ? i want to se this variation of soccer that three teams play
17796,"i do enjoy his humor , but i am a capitalist and not a socialist so i do n't agree wit hiim politically . i can not imagine how 3 teams playing can make sense ."
17797,i agree with you . i definitely do n't like his politics . he was in the movie big daddy with adam sandler and i did like that movie . have you ever played tennis ?
17798,"i have . i had a female neighbor who played club level competition one she found me , a male , to be a good training partner . a some that is not returned is oven objective of the game ."
17799,yep thats 've . i used to play when i was in high school . i lie playing with two people which they called doubles
17800,"that is a surprisingly different game . polo shirts were invented for tennis by rene ' the crocodile ' lacoste . thus , the brand for polo ."
17801,you 'd think it would have been invented by a polo player . did you know that a black man won the first us open title in 1968
17802,no . there have n't been many prominent us players who were male and black . but the williams sisters haven sure been something . the tennis ball is hollow .
17803,yes the williams sisters are really good l the black man that won back in 1968 has bee the only one to o so but i know that we will have more in the future
17804,"could be . i m from oklahoma and barry swimmer said that the last b ; hack athletes that used to play for him now go into basketball instead . so , it will require some black athletes to direct there efforts toward tennis before they win a lot . i hope tos i it ."
17805,that makes sense . pretty crazy that they use the helicopter to dry grass tennis courts back in 1969 . i bet the us open was a really crazy place back then
17806,how about a match hat lasted 11 hours and was spread over 3 days ?
17807,yep that would be exhausting ! i would lol so bad for the guy that lost . so much effort for so little reward
17808,great point ! i have seen s cricket match last for 8 hours . nice chat !
17809,hey did you see that originally croatia was going to he the runner up to the world cup ?
17810,"yeah , i di ? do you watch much soccer ?"
17811,"no not usually , i probably wo n't watch the 2022 world cup in qatar , what about you ?"
17812,me either . lol but i enjoy watching the fan 's behaviors l they can get pretty wild about their soccer .
17813,"ya they really get into it , it is cool that the usa got third place in the 1930 world cup , had when they were good haha"
17814,"yeah , that 's cool . i find it funny that were more french born players playing against france than for it in the 2014 world cup ."

17821,"lol nope but thats not a good sign , i ca n't believe that soccer makes more money than all other sports combine d , this a ton of money"

17823,"ya he was , he actually represented the us in the pan american games back n 1983"
17824,did you hear about the german soccer player who donated his bonus he got for winning the world cup to pay for 23 kids surgeries in brazil ?
17825,"wow that was nice of him ! b hack to qatar , i wonder why they are building the city for that game , apparently no country gets a vote economic increase fro , hosting the world cup"
17826,"proabably some rich oil tycho wants to brag about his city hosting the world cup ? whoo knows they they do what they do , htey have more money than they know what to do with , apparently ."
17827,yeah it sounds like it . did you ever hear why americans called fame soccer and not football ? apparently the word soccer is slang for association football
17828,leave it up to americans ! what can i say we like our slang words .
17829,"can ya we do , it 's interesting how world wars can mess with sports , they did n't do a world cup in 1942 or 1946 due to wwi"

17838,yeah . they are the only thing we have to look forward to i soccer . it 's the whole system tthat needs renaming .
17839,yesh for sure . and the host countries never make any money for hosting the world cup
17840,seems like a bad investment then . do you think eater should host the 2022 world cup ?
17841,i am not sure considering the city hosting doe not exist yet
17842,right ? how can fifa approve that ? seems shady . . .
17843,"i am not sure , i really fin that strange . did you know in 2014 there were more frenchborn players playing against it than in the actual french team ?"
17844,i ha dino idea ! that 's really strange . france may have a really good farm system though .
17845,do you know villian thurman ?
17846,i do not . who is that
17847,techs soccer palmer who scored only two international old in his career both at the 2014 worlds cup

17854,year nd tennis can als b employed with two players on each side
17855,yes . the tetris equipment are tennis ball and tennis racket .
17856,i never knew that polo shirts were invented for tennis players rene lacoste

17860,do you know who players in the longest tennis match lasting 11 hours ?
17861,"yes , i know 8 years ago t wimbledon , john isner and nicolas mashup played the longest ever tennis march in history . the match went on for three days and took place over 11 hours and 5 minutes with fisher coming out victorious 60s in the nfl set ."
17862,"that 's pretty crazy , wonder if they had to use a helicopter to dry the grass like they did in the 1968 us open"
17863,i d n't know .
17864,"do you follow soccer at all , it makes more money that football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis , and hockey combined"
17865,i love tennis and basket bal games .
17866,nice . there 's a variation of soccer with 3 team facing off against each mother
17867,yes . adn i also love gymnastics . it 's relaly beautiful . they are awesome .
17868,"gymnastics is fun to watch , one olympic gymnast won 6 medals with a wooden leg in 1904"
17869,"yeah , i kno . it was awesome . i was george louis geyser and was a germanamerican gymnast ."
17870,nes . the first person to score a perfect 10 wasa nadia comaneci fro mromania
17871,finest woman to score a perfect 10 in an olympic gymnastics event at the 1976 olympic games at age 14 .
17872,"well i got to go , nice chattin witht you"
17873,do you watch the world cup ?
17874,yes i saw it along with the 3 . 2 billion other people around the world who watched it as well . did you see it ?
17875,"yeah , i like soccer , a lot of people do , even jon stewart was a really good soccer player ."
17876,"jo stewart , the comedian ? yeah , do you know where the next world cup will be played ?"
17877,"it will be in qatar , i think , they have to build a lot of infrastructure to accommodate i t ."
17878,"yeah , i im , aging there would also have to be a lot of ac since it can get very very hot in those climates !"
17879,"and a lot of power plants have to be build , they have to build a city where he final wil be hosted . i think so is a little too much money ."
17880,"i wonder if these investments every return a positive cash flow , to me it just doesn ' them like it 's possible at all . i 'd also imagine the ' dave to loosen up on visa restriction into get more visitors ."
17881,"yeah i do n't think they are like the german player who take his world cup victory bonus to brazilian children , who needed surgeries ."
17882,"taht 's quite commendable , a lot of the other players should follow suit ! but considering that soccer players run nanu average of 7 miles per game , they might be too aired to thin , nationally ."
17883,"there is also a variation of soccer with 3 teams , they would run even more . i wonder what rules they have for a ."
17884,"wow , they must be in great shape ! all except for the people in greenland whoo a n't join fifa because not enough grass grows there fo soccer fields . that does n't mean players ca n't play right ?"
17885,"they could play on astroturf . they probably do , it is a popular sport ."
17886,"yeah but even with playing on turf , they still wo n't be the to join the leagues . surprising to see size and scale of super bowl relative to soccer , super bowl is only na americans thing while soccer is global , i gues s ."
17887,"i think it comes to a question of equipment , you only need a ball and 2 goat lol soccer ."
17888,"i see . then there 's logos andc mascots , the french national team uses a rooster because rooster in latin is similar to the name fred forgo app or the current day france , who knew there 's melania behind these things ."
17889,"footbal , is full of details , american call it soccer because it comes from association football"
17890,"that 's a very good one ! the there ' e the colors of jerseys . the french team did a bad job of coprdinating the team jersey na they found it was the same color as their opponents , so they had to borrow a different color jersey from a local team . that 's hilarious , hey should 've played as is , that would 've made an entertaining gram it watch ."
17891,"yeah , instead of a game with 2 teams , there would hav been only 1 , everybody is a winner ! . . . nd a loser ."
17892,do people place bets on the outcome of those games ?
17893,"i do n't know anything about betting of soccer matches . but is suppose so , it is played in 00 countries . some of them must permit betting on matches ."
17894,"yeah , i think that right be the next big thin g !"
17895,"hello there , are you a fan of football , or soccer as they all it in the us ?"
17896,yes ! i am one of 250 million people in world who play soccer haha
17897,"yeah same here , i do n't know why we call it soccer here in the states , do you know why they started calling it that ?"
17898,"i think it 's something to do with it being a slang name for association football . did you know that soccer makes more money than football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis , and hockey combined ;"
17899,"yep , good all , started as a slang term for association football . and that is pretty remarkable , i like when people here say it 's not a popular sport ."
17900,they should televise the variation of soccer where there are 3 dreams that face off at the same tme . maybe they would get more spectators in the us
17901,"that sounds too crazy , i wonder if they used the same size field or not ."
17902,"it 's hard to believe that jon stewart nwas a really skilled soccer layer . heat cruz , us represented the us at the pa america games in brazil . i guess for him there was more money in comedy ."
17903,"that is pretty impressive , i never knew that and do n't think most people have ."
17904,ar eyou into any other sports ?
17905,"i am , i really like basketball and my favorite team has he best record in the league right now ! ? about you ?"
17906,"i really enjoy watching tennis . although when i play it the object for me is more to just get the ball over the net than to return it in such a way that my opponents is not able to return it haha it is definitely ahrdsr than it , lots !"
17907,"yeah it really is , that or makes a lot of skill and endurance to play that 's for sure ."
17908,"i enjoy watching roger federer , he is such a talented player . well , except for the ti , e he lost to gael monfils who had just learned to play tennis a few days before heir match ."
17909,"really , i 'm sure that was the thrill of a lifetime for that person to beat him !"
17910,i 'm sure ! i would rather be known as the guy who beat roger federer han one . the players in the long tennis match in history . it went on for 11 hours ! can yu famine how exhausted the athletes would have been after tha t !
17911,"that i just insane , i wonder how many people rom the original crowd that started hte match her still there to watch thee nd ."
17912,"i know , right ? that would take some serious commitment ! it panned over 3 days ."
17913,"right , i wonder if they got back into the place free each day ?"
17914,i would hope so ! i am just so impressed by the athleticism . and you her about olympics athletes like edit black who wr enable to win a bronze medal in the olympics for tennis doubles and gold medals in 800 and 1500 meter races . i would be so excite if i was that talented at one sport le malone two !
17915,"that is the most impressive thing i have hear din a while . ot was nice talking with you , i hope you have a good day ."
17916,"hell , do you like frogs ?"
17917,theyd have their moments . i appreciate that they are one of only two animal ; s able t instinctively understand pointing .
17918,thats interesting . i recently read that dogs have 12 different blood types .
17919,"that 's a lot , more than humans ? did you know that dogs are n't actually colorblind ? they just ca n't see ad as kanya colors as people ."
17920,"yeah , thats good to know . i used to think that they were colorblind ."
17921,"i guess color is n't as important in you can do so many different tasks , from builtin grand herding to aiding drisalbed peopel ."
17922,"yeah , it probably is not a need for them ."
17923,thy certainly are man 's bet friend . google few has a policy that states that they are a dog company .
17924,"i agree , i love y dog , i do ish she would laugh at my jokes once in awhile though lol thats really cool abou google !"
17925,"i guess a laughing dog wild be a good companion . in boulder , co , people do n't even ' own ' their pets because oi that nba of the relationship ; youse just their r ' guardian ?"
17926,"oh wow , that interesting , i never new that . in istanbul they have vending machines the release food and water for strays , in exchange for recycled plastic bottles ."
17927,"that 's a neat idea . it woul come in useful in a country liken japan , where there are more puts than children under 15 ."
17928,wow that is incredible ! they have that amount dogs ! yeah that would eb pretty useful !
17929,"i think they probably have more cats than dogs , given the land limitations there haha . you know who had a lot of pets ? teddy roosevelt ; he had over 20 , including a bear and a hyena ."
17930,"thats crazy ! i 'm sure he had help though , for an average american that is a lot of work . i read that the first cat cloned was named copy cat lol"
17931,that 's clever . maybe they can clone tigers to increase their numbers ; there are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia !
17932,"wow that is really sa be they should come all the endangered species , mighty need lab digger lab ifr larger animals like sharks lol"
17933,"i 'm not sure how practical that would be , since it ' ? s so hard to track those populations anyway to figure out if they need new members ."
17934,"well the discovery channel is always making shows bout endangered animals , do hey could start there . i know sharks are endangered and a few times of beats ."
17935,i think in the mean time it 's important to raise proper therapy animals ; it seems like some people just claim regular pets are therapy animals . maybe that could be a discovery chanel show !
17936,"yeah seriously , people take advantage of that just so their regular pets cna go to restaurants and stuff . its kind of annoying on hey claim its a ' support ' dog ."
17937,"yes , i think children in hospitals and elderly folks in nursing homes need the company more to lift their spirits and work on the goals . nice chatting !"
17938,"i love goldendoodle , i have one myself . she 's only forty pounds ot eighty like lord sandwich ."
17939,"i think lord sandwich is a funny name lol , they started a winners back in 2014 it ?"
17940,"i do like that name as well . i wish that my dog had an unusual name like his . i would hav out my dog on the label from the beginning . yes , they did open in 2014 ."
17941,"you cash still change its name lol it would be confused but eventually will answer to the name , its amazing how they raised 2000 ink bust 30 days"
17942,"i think it would be more confusing for em after six years ! if you have a nice , unique product an 'the proper rewards , you can get a lot of funding through kickstafter ."
17943,"i agree , its a good way to fund your company , its amazing how many followed lord sandwich has on instagram 150 ! !"
17944,"do you follow any animals by instagram ? i have to admit that i do , i might have to look up lord sandwich ."
17945,"i dont but i might make an exception for lord sandwich , im curious to meet the little guy ,"
17946,80 pounds nd as tall as doorknob smokes me think eh is n't so little . i wonder if they made a white wine for him based on his fur color ?
17947,"i think they took that into account , you know they are planning to release a wiener with his newt i it , it will be a white wine production"
17948,are you a big wine drinker ? i am not but i might make an exception for this one .
17949,"i do like win e , and i might look up some of the wines the company has to offer , they have a german region based wine thati has a price of 20 so i might try that one"
17950,i do like to try elses expensive wines because i don ot know the difference as much between vintage . i do not know if i have tried an wines from the german region .
17951,"read i dont know much about wine either i do like the taste of pilot noir , i think its interesting how they ar planning to make wines from regions such as austria and looney valley"
17952,its definitely great to explore the different regions . it could open their client bas up immensely and help people find new wisest hey might not have known about .
17953,"i think its a good business decision , you got to keep things fresh and updated , s o do you have ny pets ?"
17954,i only have thye one goldendoodle . i often watch my sister 's dog so i feels as if i have two dogs al ot of the time .
17955,"thats nice , so im guessing your more of a dog person that a cat person ?"
17956,"yes , i have an allergy to cat have so i was kind of forced into it . i do n't otherwise mind them in small doses ."
17957,i am more of a dog person and so i google l they prefer dogs to cats and they have mad ethics clear
17958,i think that in an office setting dogs ar wa bit more social and appropriate than cats . cats seen to be very self sufficient and isolated .
17959,"yea i agree with you dogs and cats are the most popular pets , you know roosevelt had over 20 pets , he had a bear and also a hyena as pets ."
17960,in you hear about the goldendoodle wo helped t creat a wine brad ?
17961,i did ! seems they took avantage of our love of pets am social media be build the following !
17962,"they certainly did ! it 's cool that they raised 25 , 000 in 30 days , just because of teh theme ' farmers first '"
17963,"we l , loved dogs and have 2 . the are n't golden noodles but we got them from a rescue group . they have n't ever donated bloom because tey are small but apparently they could because there are 12 different blood types instead of the 3 human types ."
17964,that is interesting . i did n't know there were that many dog blood types . i hope that the dogs get a treat after the blood drive thouhg .
17965,"they should ! i guess e re google type of people since they prefer dogs to cats . i do like cats , but i 'm really allergic to them . : ,"
17966,"yep i 'm glad that google prefers dogs to cats lol . i am allergic to them too but i do like the . i think . 's crazy that only dogs can elephants understand pointing , not eve gorillas which you think would be very smart"
17967,"hmm . it does seem weird that other primates do n't get pointing . i have a dog that loves a yellow ball and she ignored the other colored balls . i guess yellow must eb one of the colors they can see . i know they do n't see all the ones we do , but she must have that one !"
17968,"i agree it you ! i 'm just glad that dogs are not actually colorblind , they just see different colors from us , poor doggos !"
17969,i like that istnabvul exchange used water bottles for water and food for stray dogs ! stings like them would help the rescue group we got our dogs from .
17970,i think that 's a really good use of stray dogs tough . it 's very smart . do you wear socks by the way ?
17971,"i 'm wearing two pairs now , because it is really co , it today ! but i do n't like wool socks because they ar scratchy , to me ."
17972,yep i agree l it 's funny that the oldest known socks were supposed to be on with sandals and that is definitely not what is in passion now lol
17973,right ! the old socks wand flip flops are not a good combo ! i think its ' funny that part a sock in it ' comes from the habit of stuffing a sock in the old phonograph so it 's world n't be so loud .
17974,yep i agree ep ut 's funny that the inventor of the modern sock also produced the first modern water ballots . i wonder what he was thinking about
17975,i do n't know but my kids are sure happy . they love to throw water balloons in the summer ! have you ever thought to donates rocky to a homeless shelter ? some that is an idea money really need but o n't often get .
17976,"no i have n't done that , but i guess i should . i think it 's funny that the phrase ' put a sock in it ' was invented 1800s lol"
17977,"since it 's cold today , maybe i should try putting chili peppers in my socks to keep my feet warm , like the portuguese . i guess they cut him up first ?"
17978,lol that ' a good question . it sounds liek it would hurt though . you have any pets ?
17979,"i already mentioned that i have 2 dogs , several times ! i'ts funny that in colorado you have o a you are a pets gurdian ' and not that you own them !"
17980,"yep you 're right , i was only paying attention to myself because i have a husky lol . it ' weird that the first cloned cat was named copycat though ."
17981,are you familiar with fifa world cup ?
17982,i am a little fmailar with it . i think i haven qtdched a few times on television . do you watch ?
17983,i watcher other in the past since y good friend is from england . the current champion is franco .
17984,i remember watching af e of those games that were i russia on television n i woud have thought russia would benefit economically from hosting but apparently hosting countries dont get any financial boosts .
17985,i was surprised to hear about it . i think it has to do with pride more than anything else .
17986,you are probably right . i mean qatar is building a whole new city just to host te 2022 games .
17987,"most of the hosts have tons of money to spare . qatar be going to hot in 2022 , is that correct ?"
17988,"that is correct . you know , the media says soccer is not all th popular in the u . s . but it got 3rd place in the first world cup in 1930 !"
17989,i know . that was not big for a new comedy .
17990,"true ! i suppose they are not as good as argentina or have the worlds beet player , mesut , on their team ."
17991,messi is very good at soccer in e was almost allowed to leave the club for free 10 years ago .
17992,i think its wool and also odd that no one in his hometown can name a kid messi anymore .
17993,i did not kno what ? please tell me the reason why .
17994,out of respect ohh im . they want him to be teh only one .
17995,i wonder if there is an official ordinance for that . it 's weird .
17996,i imagine there is as that would just ad duo the respect they have for him . did you know that there is a soccer game where 3 teams face each other ?
17997,no i did not . please tell me more abut it .
17998,apparently each team faces each other at the we time ! this i would like to see but i must not be very popular as main stream media does not talk about it or show it .
17999,that was interesting 3 teams facing tech other .
18000,i know . i cna only imagine how that must be played .
18001,"it would be chaotic , i think . i keep saying soccer instead of football because it is what brings called in the us ?"
18002,do you like soccer ? th first worlds up was in 1930
18003,"hello , i do like soccer . did you knw drew zealand was the only undefeated team in the 2010 world cup ?"
18004,american womens team has never placed below third in the world cup
18005,that ; s interesting . i always thought htey were good too .
18006,the city thats set for the 2022 world cup doesnt even exist yet . are they up ; doing an entire city ? ?
18007,that 's hilarious ! i wonde how that is doing to work out .
18008,"i dont know . lol . soccer makes more money than football , basketball , golf , tennis wand hockey combine . i ca n't believe that"
18009,that amazing . i would have never guessed that . there was only 1 group in world cup history to end with a way tie .
18010,there is a variation of soccer where 3 teams face off at the same time . how in the world does that work ? and where is it played ?
18011,that wold be very fun to watch . i am not sure where it 's played .
18012,"a german soccer player used his world cup earnings to paw for surgeries for 23 children , now why do n't more players do stuf fluke that instead of wasting all the money on frivolous things ?"
18013,very cool and god for him . i love hearing stories like that . it helps my heart .
18014,mine too . there are no economic gains for the countries that host world cap or olympic games . j cant se chow that is true all of the people blocking goto your city must be god for business
18015,i cindy that interesting becaue i always thought it helped their economy . did you know greneladn ca n't join fifa because not enough grass rows there for a soccer field ?
18016,hahha its funny because its greenland . i wonder why they do lay sod ? or maybe its just too old
18017,haha i heard greenland is actually all ice and cold and that iceland is actually warmer and green .
18018,"yes thats exactly right . the world , d cup was not held in 1942 or 46 because of ww2"
18019,did it know that . the super bowl is smaller than soccer 's third biggest event .
18020,how is that even possible and where does it take place ? certainly not in america .
18021,not really sure lol . i would not think ot 's possible either .
18022,good talk !

18031,the spinoff was named pet force which featured garfield and gang as superheroes .
18032,hm . i think ill pass . i never really like garfield . maybe as a superhero it would be funnier . lol
18033,i agree . have you heard about ' normalman ' ?
18034,"um , sounds like me lol . do is normalman ?"
18035,he is a person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes .
18036,that is ironic . i wonder what he does a may . i guess he is the butt of jokes ; hard to for a girl friend . he is a freak .
18037,poor normalman . there is another comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes .
18038,"era , that would be a thankless job . putting things back to the way they were ? what do you want , a medal ? no thanks . ill be a superhero ."

18050,i loved them movie and the concert . people think he was named after the black panther party but was named before that . i did n't know he was that rich !
18051,i did n't know hat either ! it 's cool that the used an actual ancient language from the 4th century as the symbols in that movie
18052,wow that ie so interesting . did you know the guy who played black panther got his start because of denzel washington .
18053,"that . apparently when he was giving his speech during the black panther premiere and actually thank denzel for his support back then , that 's really nice of him"
18054,"wow , very nice . remember your roots is how i feel . stan lee wrote black panther and all the marvel comics , crazy"
18055,"he 's very talented ! he also wrote a bunch of comics for dc apparently , and he was reimagining superheroes like batman and superman , too would be interesting to read"
18056,"wow , that is awesome . i think i heard he wrote like 15 comics for dc"
18057,yep you 're right . i also hear that garfield has as spinoff where he is a superhero lol that sounds kind of cool
18058,"that would be fun to read . i wonder how that went , he could sling lasagna ."
18059,"haha i want to eat lasagna thati as me hungry . speaking of superheroes , did ou know that there are over 300 superheroes that have ben registered in the united states ?"
18060,"wow , that is a lot . is the in the comics or in real life ?"
18061,"haha . just for the comics . bum there in a comic called normal man . he 's the only person in his universe that is normal and has n superpowers , everyone close is a superhero"
18062,i did n't know there was a comic about me lol ! i wonder if he was in the comic strip about fixing the collateral damage caused by super heroes
18063,"haha ye si think so . that actually sounds pretty interesting . and i never knew that comic book started in the 1960s , i would have thought they started earlier than that"
18064,wow that was a long time ago ! i wonder what those comics are worth now . it was so nice chatting with you !
18065,"yes , looks can be worth a lot of money . and i know that there 's even a college campus that has th largest public comic book collection int he world , i think it 's in michigan i should check it out !"
18066,"wow , i need to check i dont . i am going to google taht ! have a great night !"
18067,"hello , have you ever thought about how important google has become ?"
18068,"i hasve , its the 1 search engine , it 's become really big ."
18069,i heard that on august 16 2013 google wen down for five minutes and disrupted 40 percent of web traffic
18070,"wow that is amazing , 40 percent of the web traffic ? have you ever used the google maps app ?"
18071,no but i know that it calculate traffic by the speed of android devices moving down the road . i think that is interesting .
18072,"it doe , ive always wondered how they did that , i guess mystery solved , its amazing how much power a single google search requires ."
18073,ive read that a single search takes more computing than i took to send men to the moon . thats har do believe .
18074,"i know right ? technology surely has advanced a lot , kind of like iphones , ive bee royal to the brand since the first generation iphone was released back in 2007"
18075,did you know tha microsoft held a funeral fort he death of iphone when it launched its version of the phone ?
18076,"i did not know that how interestin , i wonder who went to the funeral !"
18077,good question . probably a marketing idea . i heard of a game called send m to heaven that was created to have people throw their phones in the air and break them
18078,"that gamer doest see fun to play , i think that the game got banned because it was actually more popular in thee nd ."
18079,apple banned the game because it was encouraging guesses to engage in behavior hat might damage the device .
18080,"i think that was a good decision , you know theres a stat and womb are more likely to have an iphone ethan mon ."
18081,that is an interesting stat . are there any ideas as to why this is true . i also heard that mat bellamy used an those to record his unborn child heartbeat .
18082,"im not sure maybe because of the devil , you know theres more than 2 . 2 million apps available for the iphone now"
18083,thats a lot of apps . the iphone has come along why as to what it can be used for . so man uses its amazing .
18084,i know 2 . 2 billion apps its a lot and that was in 2017 i bet there a lot more new apps now
18085,im sure you 're right probably may more apps for different uses by now .
18086,"yeah , so do you play any instruments , ive always liked the sound of the guitar ."
18087,i fo play guitar i enjoy listening to pink floyds guitarist .
18088,"i enjoy pink floyd as well . , he turned a boat into a floating studio , how cool !"
18089,"hi , how are you ?"
18090,im goo chow bout yourself
18091,"i am well , thanks . do you know who john lewis is ?"
18092,no i dont who is he .
18093,he is a civil rights protesters from georgia . he is now a rep . he watched with king candw as invoked with the police brutality in birmingham .
18094,really . he sounds like a pretty stand up guy .
18095,yesh . trump went after him on twitter last year saying he never stood up for anything . twitter waaay quick to show the police dogs tearing his flesh . . .
18096,"two , this is the first im hearing of any of this . guess trump stuck his foot in his mouth there huh ."
18097,yeah . it was baffling that he either had the idea or just did n't care . i was both horrified and watching gleefully .
18098,i dont understand . you were watching gkeefully as police dogs attacked somebody .
18099,do ! ! ! watching trump getting blasted on twitter . sorry for the confusion ? that 's not something i really want to get mixed up . sorry about that .
18100,its ok . i kind of figured what you meant by it . lol .
18101,the whole ; e john lewis incident became known as bloody sunday . i can not imagine what they want o go through .
18102,"me either . it makes me feel a little guilty being a white man today . i know that im no racist andc one of my family is , but thet things black had to to through back then is horrifying ."
18103,"agreed with all of that . let 's lighten this up a little , shall we ? maybe they coul write a comic series about fixing all of the collateral damage us white guys id like marvel did ."
18104,neat would be awesome . me and my son watch superhero movies all the time . cant hurt to have one more to watch .
18105,stat sounds fun . my on is 7 and a litle scared still . there are over 300 registered superheros .
18106,maybe he would enjoy the garfield spinoff where garfield and the gang were all superheroes .
18107,is his mortal enemy heart burn from all that lasagna ? or would it be his kryptonite ?
18108,lol . im definitely gon na have to check that one out now .
18109,nice chatting with you !
18110,good evening ! guess how google maps calculates traffic ?
18111,hey ! i 'd eb interested to learn how traffic is calculated
18112,"they go by hte gps devices ina android phones , which is data they have access to . they track how fast the phones are moving along hte road ."
18113,"oh wow , that is interesting and totally makes sense ! i 've heard they used to use ive goat stop ? mow ' here lawn . . google uses resources well huh !"
18114,"yes , they once used 100 live goats . only once . i wonder why it did n't continue ."
18115,"i 'm imagining 10 alive goats around the headquarters lol , probably chaos !"
18116,"yes . i wonder why they did n't use sheep instead , adn how , such work was involved in cleaning up after the goats ."
18117,probably a lot of clean . i cant imagine it was more cos effective tha hiring a landscaping company .
18118,"yes , but i thin kit would have made it a more fun place to work ."
18119,"hav veto keep the workplace interesting ! like microsoft , holding a funeral for the ' death of the iphone ' when their line of shoes was launched ."
18120,yes . have you heard of the ' send me to heaven ' iphone game ? i wonder if microsoft nwas behind it .
18121,"yes , i 've read about that and that would make sense of microsoft doing something like that . so silly"
18122,the creator 's stated goal was to shatter as many iphones as possible . j really wonder if it was someone wing a financial stake in things or just a person he does n't like iphones .
18123,that would have to be a really big hatred for iphones .
18124,yeah . i ca n't believe it make it to the app store .
18125,i was surprised to learn that women are more likely to own a phone than men .
18126,"yes , it 's interesting . i wonder what the reason are ."
18127,"i see busy a many men as i do woman , walking around with their noses stuck in their phone these days !"
18128,yes ! i do n't tend to notice whether people 's phones are iphones or androids . did you know that the app store fo riots has 2 . 2 million apps ?
18129,"oh wow , that is a huge number . i wonder how useful half of those apps are ."
18130,yes . i wonde a it 's been good to talk go you wh ave a good night !
18131,"hi there , do you use google nor another search engine ?"
18132,hi ! i love google ! i use it everyday
18133,"nice , me too . apparently to do a search though there is more computing power required than it took to send 12 astronauts to the moon"
18134,"on august 16th 2013 , google went down for about 5 minutes and took 5o percent o 'the web traffic wish it . interesting , because that tells u show many people actually use google ."
18135,yeah i think most people use it exclusively . do you know how they calculate traffic ?
18136,i 'm not sure . do you ?
18137,yeah they take the average of android devices that are moving on traffic
18138,il ike the fact that yiu can types n address into google end it will take you to google maps . that always comes i handy .
18139,yeah it sure is . do you know when it was founded and by whom ?
18140,i do not . do you now ?
18141,yeah it was sadly page and sergey brin in 1998 .
18142,do you know what google 's unofficial slogan as ?
18143,i did not know they had one bu ti am not sure what it is . do you know ?
18144,' do n't be evil '
18145,"oh wow , did not expect tit to eb that . once they hired goats instead of getting people to mow their lawns"
18146,yes that is pretty interestin g ! do you know how google maps calculate traffic ?
18147,yeah they are the average of android devices as they move around int traffic
18148,cloud storage comes in handy when you have too many files on your phone .
18149,that has become a life saver honestly . do you have an ipone o android ?
18150,i ahve an android . iphones seem really complicated to me .
18151,"well , it seems women are more likely to get one taht men"
18152,really ? i had no idea .
18153,yeah someone must have on a study on that to find such stats .
18154,hi ther e ! looking forward to chat with you !
18155,"good evening ! just got back on a quasidate night with my wife . it was n't much , but we dropped a kid off for practice zany drove around a bit ."
18156,quasidate ? what 's that ?
18157,"quake is sort of like ' partly . ' so i was n't a planned date night , though i know it ks important or couples and parents ."
18158,"sounds cool : , wht is your kid practicing ? : ,"
18159,she is a soccer player doing fetal this winter . it worked pretty well because our older kids could watch those at home while we had an hour to ourselves .
18160,"good prioritizing : , does she like soccer ? or she goes there to she has to ? ; 0"
18161,she definitely likes it . the only tying she does n't like is doing drills by herself at home . i think things like i ; phones and google just make it easy to be distracted .
18162,"yes those are true enemies of sporty hen it comes to kids : ,"
18163,do you have an i ; honey ?
18164,"i have huawei ; , android phone : , you ?"
18165,"mine is a samsung , but i think they are all so similar . plus , i am a guy , and i guess woman are more likely to own iphones . : ,"
18166,"i did n't want to believe taht , but a the woman i talked about the subject had also iphones : , so i guess that 's true : ,"
18167,they apparently have n't downloaded the game ' send me to heaven . ' the goal of that is to see how high you can find your iphones as the creator of the game said he hoped it would lead to th iphones shattering .
18168,"lol . . . sounds like a game for dummies s : ,"
18169,ouch . . . lol . might be harder to get as apple banned it from their all store .
18170,"ok , if i could be game creator i would sue ! if somebody wants the gmail he or she should be bale to get it ; , and apple should love the game people would keep buying new phones : ,"
18171,that 's a good point . i ma not a huge fan of the product . ' iphone ' is not something i spend my time on google looking gump .
18172,naah . . i gave up on apple long time ago . i 'll buy anything but that . . .
18173,"that sounds ; like me . while iphone users ca n't live without their phones , most of hte world ca n't do without google . in 2013 , google went down for five minutes and took a little less than half of web traffic with it !"
18174,"wow . . those buys really used to be watching what their are doing ; ,"
18175,"well , i used to sign off . i need to check google on a few things before bed anyway ."
18176,ahve you ever beard of john lewis ?
18177,"np , i have n't heard of him . what i she famous for ?"
18178,he was famous for marching along with 600 others from selma yo montgomery to demand their voting rights s .
18179,was he working with martin luther king ?
18180,"i think he was , instead of going arrested they were badly beaten by the alabama law enforcement officers ."
18181,that sounds like alabama . was the marc ha success ? did it change political perception ?
18182,"yes , it was a pivotal moment in hte civil rights movement ."
18183,what did lewis go on to do after that ?
18184,"who wrote a graphic novel trilogy titled ' march , ' depleting the event ."
18185,that 's a great way to tell history . graphic novels are a good way to get people interested . history comes alive ;
18186,"yeah , she peopel view him as a superhero ."
18187,perhaps he could become one of the more than 300 registered superheroes in the us .
18188,that 's a lot of superheroes . it 's hard fro how to think that they can come up with so many different super power s .
18189,"i wonder if they just get together , drink and smoke , and softball ideas until somthing seems good . there is a superhero called ' normalman . ' he was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes ."
18190,"that 's funny , never heard of that one , but i definitely coudl relate to him ."
18191,"in a universe of superheroes , you would be ursula . did you know that there is a theory taht there is only one electron in the universe ? strange ."
18192,"no i did n't , there 's another theory that the universe might be a giant super hologram ."
18193,that sounds more reasonable . everything is the matrix and we 're just here to entertain a b7unhc of robots . or superheroes .
18194,"yeah , one giant video game ."
18195,and i would be normalman . not a robot . not a superhero .
18196,"yeah , me too !"
18197,hey there partner . are you a soccer fan ? then it world cup is going to be in 2022 in qatar .
18198,i am a soccer fan and watch th world cup ever 4 years !
18199,nice me too ! it 's been around since 1930 but i feel like it 's only grown in popularity since then .
18200,yes ! he zealand was teh only undefeated team in the 2010 world cup .
18201,well that is really awesome . in the first ever world cup the united state egot third place . not bad for the first ever world cup .
18202,not bad at all . there was only 1 group in world cup history to pun with a 4 way tie .
18203,i 'm surprised they did n't break that tie ! the hungary national football team only had one defeat between 1950 and 1956 and tha nwas the word cup final !
18204,that 's pretty incredible . soccer players run an average of 7 miles pe game !
18205,no older they are in such incredible shape . the fifa world cup was not heel in 1942 in 196 due to the second world war . very sad .
18206,yes . sad indeed . 3 . 2 billion people watched the 2010 in world cup !
18207,"that is truly amazing . soccer is so popular and it makes more money than football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis , and hockey combined !"
18208,is n't that incredible ? greenland ca n't join fifa because not enough grass grows there or a soccer field !
18209,it is so funny because there is a green in th rename yet they ca n't grow green grass . i find of feel bad for them lol . there 's actually a variation of soccer were three teams face each other at the same time . i would like to see that .
18210,i wonder how that works ; sounds liek it could get confusing being on the filed at they same time .
18211,yeah it would be very confusing to m3 . the talkshow host john stewart was a skilled soccer player in college and eh even represented the us at the panamerican games n brazil .
18212,i did n't realize he was that old . i do n't think i remember him until the 1990s .
18213,yesh he is much older than it thought . he looks pretty young for his age . one of the best players in the world is leo messi . he i soso fu it watch .
18214,yes . he is valued at 120 million euro ! big money !
18215,big money indeed ! he has a growth hormone deficiency that led him to play soccer in spain ! pretty cool ! and it was lovely speaking with you about many things today !
18216,that 's nuts ! left he first contract given to messi was written on w paper napkin ! i had a good time chatting !
18217,bye !
18218,hi how are you ? do you liek soccer ?
18219,i do not play soccer but i watch soccer games from time to time . my best immigrated to the us from england . he invites us often to watch soccer games at his house .
18220,thet is kind of him . it is to watch the world cup . that is a spectacle worth watching .
18221,"i know , right . soccer was appear to be more fanatic than us football fans . fifa world cup is a big deal ."
18222,"yes , it is a hugely popular sport everywhere . except the us . americans usually dont understand he popular ."
18223,"3 . 2 billion people watched the 2010 fifa world cup , , . 4 percent of global population n , ."
18224,"yes , i believe it . they want to see their own country , and to see the sport played at teh highest level . it is amazing to watch ."
18225,"if is . apparently , new zealand was the only undefeated soccer team in the 2010 world cup ."
18226,really ? that is amazing . i woudl not have guessed new zealnad .
18227,it was surprising to me too . have you heard about japan 's 2022 world cup ?
18228,"no , i have not . they have rugby in 2019 k olympics ink 1020 ."
18229,japan is going to project 3rd holograms of the games live onto soccer fields across the world .
18230,that is pretty cool . i wonder how much that will cost . i would love to watch .
18231,i do n't know . millions ?
18232,"yeah , i bet . they will sell plenty of tickets . they can project it onto multiple fields at the same time ."
18233,do you hav more interesting facts about soccer ?
18234,"um , there is a variant of soccer taht involves three teams playing each other ? i dont know how it works though ."
18235,i heard about it but i myself do not really understand ho wit works .
18236,"the rules must be complicated . free kicks ? out of bounds ? hm . anyway , nice chat !"
18237,i look forward to seeing next in world cup . nice chatting with you .
18238,you too ! have a good weekend !
18239,thank you . have a good night .
18240,i find planets very interesting . how about you ?
18241,i do ! even been listening to a podcast about the universe !
18242,i'ts lure thats ' a good listen . did you know that one of jupiter 's moons would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun ?
18243,"yeah , ganymede . it has several moons ."
18244,guest hat 's te one . did you also know that venus ha snow seasons ?
18245,"yes , because it doesnt tilt o it axis . des ; kite being second from the sun it is the hottest planet ' to its atmosphere ."
18246,that 's very interesting . venus is also the only planet that rotates clockwise .
18247,"i guess that is tru e , i never thought about which way we rotated , but i guess sunrise and set give that away ."
18248,that 's true . did you also know that uranus rotates sideways ?
18249,like it rolls ? how does that affect seasons ?
18250,yes it rolls around the sun rather a spinning like other planets . i do not know how that affects it 's seasons bu i 'm curious to find out .
18251,do tou believe there is life elsewhere in the universe ?
18252,i believe there is likely microscopic life for sure .
18253,"i often wonder if we are alone in the universe , or of other life is out there , are if they are , are they looking for u stood ?"
18254,that ' a good question . this is off topic but have you used virtual reality ?
18255,not anything sophisticated . just a few games at what was disney quest .
18256,aparently up to 40 percent of users get motion sickness from vr .
18257,i can see that . i can get a little sick in first person shooter games .
18258,that 's unfortunate . did you know that the first r game was actually made in 1968 ?
18259,wow ! that is even before the nintedo !
18260,yes it 's very shocking . it was nice chatting with you .
18261,"what do you think about virtual reality headsets ? they 're not just for gaming anymore , you know !"
18262,"i like them , but have never used one . arizona state university will let you use your student loan to pay for a headset ."
18263,"that 's so crazy to me . the students can rent them out for no cost , so why should there be an option for them to use financial aid money to purchase them"
18264,tube school probably profits in the land run by getting paid interest on the loan . your right about borrowing them . there will be 150 available to students for free .
18265,"oh right , it 's student loans , not financial aid . whoops ! stil l , it seems like a strange use of funds . although i do think that they could be used for a very valuable teaching experience ."
18266,yes . i agree . asu claims taht their online biology course is the first in the nation to offer virtual reality labs .
18267,"that 's really interesting . i think vr has a lot to offer o the science community . it 's an investment , but them argihao costs , how much money it costs to do each progressive lesson , is probably a lot smaller than traditional teaching or research methods"
18268,that would be neat to be able to take the class from the comfort of your job if i wonder if there is any kind of discount for taking classes from home vs . in a real classroom ? the vr set will also come with gloves that will provide the users with a tactile tele experience .
18269,that must be such an immersive experience . the only vr i 've experienced was 's santa 's sleighride ' and it was in a little car tha salsa shifted like a rollercoaster . but i can see how there are much more important ways yo use vr . asu actually uses vr to do things like practice ' taking ' blood samples from people through the vr . i thin that 's so much better than having students tv on real people !
18270,ye s ! i agree with you . great learning tool . it will be far more engaging or th students to learn with the headset s staring at a class on theur computer screen as well .
18271,"i agree . i remember being so bored and distracted during class , one nl students have social media to distract them . i 'm guessing there 's no social media in a , although i could definitely imagine that developing in the future ."
18272,lockheed martin has a ' mars bus ' that will take kids on as to of mars . that woul be neat .
18273,"that 's so cool , there 's actually a scientist , dr . rich terrible , w ho thinks that our world is just virtual reality generated on a computer"
18274,did n't he discover several moons on saturn ?
18275,"he did actually ! astronomy is so cool , i think . did you know hat there 's actually a planets hat has shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph at 2000 degrees fahrenheit ?"
18276,"wow . that 's incredible . i couldnt oven imagine those kind of conditions . if jupiter ganymede moon orbited the sun , it would classify as a planet ."
18277,that 's cool ! if we sad that pluto is not a planet anymore after the international astronomical union refined the definition of planets in 2006
18278,i knoe . especially after all those years that we were taught in school that it was a planned . i wish they still used the space shuttle . i used to enjoy watching the launched . tube general purpose computer of the shuttle only ran on 1mb or ram .
18279,"i do n't know if that 's it or small , but i 'm guessing small . someone actually built a working 16bit computer using minecraft building blocks ! is n't that absolutely crazy ? so impressive !"
18280,that is neat ! computers are used in everything ow doing a wide range of taxis in industrial and consumer devices .
18281,"people actually think it 's possible , a nd want yo , upload their minds to memory sticks and computes . i think that 's so cool ! such a testament to the future ."
18282,hey there ! have you ever seen the movie the black panther before ? the marvel movie
18283,"no , i have n't , but i have heard of it . what about you ?"
18284,"yes i 've seen it . i think . 's ok but it 's definitely getting too much attention for what it is , it 's a pretty generic movie in my opinion ."
18285,"yeah , the marvel movies started to get played on tc maybe i ill see it ."
18286,"yeah you can see it if it 's free haha . i would n't pay any money tos i it , do you know who the rihcests superhero is in the entire marvel universe ?"
18287,is it tony start ?
18288,"haah so tony stark is actually the second richest , the first richest marvel superhero is actually the slack panther r , and then i guess bruce was who is batman is in third with 80 billion collars"
18289,oh wow ! how was he supposed to have made his money ?
18290,"yeah i think if i remember correctly , they just have a lot of advanced technology in the country that the black panther lives in , a he just has a ton of money for some reason , he ahs 500 billion dollar and tony stark has ' only ' 100 billion dollars haha ."
18291,"interesting , but they do n't specifically say what he does ?"
18292,"no , like i said i think it 's just he has a lot of technology and they sell the technology or something like that , i guess you should see the movie maybe you 'll catch something that i did n't lol . what is cool about they movies though is that they use a ancient writings for it ."
18293,interesting . will do . do you know if theur i saw comic book movie what accompanied teh movie ?
18294,"a there is a comic book . it 's actually pretty old . and whenever i think of the word black panther , i think of the political party , but apparently the comic book came out before that"
18295,"well apparently dc comics paid 130 for exclusive rights to superman , i wonder how much for black panther ?"
18296,that 's a good question . do you like marvel comic by the way ? or do you prefer dc . i mostly prefer marvel lmysefl
18297,"i do n't have a preference , but apparently mj tried to buy marvel in the early 1990s ."
18298,"wow that 's cool . when you say mj , do you mean michael jackson ? that would ave been really crazy . i think it 's interestin tthat marvel and dc both own a character , and is name is access , and it 's only purpose is to keep both universes separate"
18299,"yeah , the king of pop . he ap ; apprently tried to buy them so he could play spiderman in his own produced movie ."
18300,"that souds awesome ! i wish we coudl have had that haha . do you like sony pictures by the ay ? apparently they had the chance to buy all of the marvel characters for only , y 25 million dollars by ink 1998"
18301,"i do , i was believe that . that was a mistake , but he again nobody knew that these types of movies would blow up teh way they did ."
18302,"no i agree with you . and that 's why sony only has the right to spiderman , they bought it for 10 million dollars , and i thought tht was the only superhero anyone would ever want to see"
18303,good morning ! are you into superheros movies ?
18304,"yes , i am . did you watch ' black panther ' ?"
18305,i did ! i ca n't believe it won a lot of oscars ! he 's considered the richest superhero .
18306,"yes , indeed . i do like elicia wright as shirt in ' black panther ' . she also said in order interviews that one of her character will inspire girls to pursue it msubj4ecta ."
18307,that is such an awesome thing to say ! i wonder where chadwick boseman would be if denzel washington did n't pay for his school ?
18308,"good question also writer regional huddling told the washington posts ' comic riffs ' that 's everyone should be a black either , its not just for boys ."
18309,well said ! do you like marvel or dc comics more ?
18310,herd to chose . but i do really like that ' black panther ? also teaches women how to show up for themselves in life and love . you should really watch it .
18311,it is such a great movie ! then and black panther actualy predates the group !
18312,"yes i know . by the way the richest superhero is black panther , who ha san estimated of 500 billion . . whereas bruce wayne 80 billion ."
18313,"i thought tony stark would eb , but he 's poor compared to him at 100 billion dollars lol ."
18314,"yes , agree ; it is hard to believe that marvel in 1998 . offered the cinematic rights for almost all of its characters to sony for a mere 25 million , sony rejected the offer , wrong move ."
18315,i bet they kick themselves in the butt everytime they see how much a movie make lol . have you ever heard of the superhero access ?
18316,"no . you , know it is interesting that teh largest comic book market is japan , but if course ."
18317,i did not know that ! its ' good star the largest public collection is here in america though !
18318,"do , i do agree . by the way the michigan state university library has the largest publicly available comic cook collection in the world ."
18319,i was wondering who actually did it ! i think marvel did 8th gret when htey published a generic comic book to trademark certain words and titles .
18320,"yes . yiu know one of my favorite comic book , ends stan lee ends every phone conversation he has with the word ' excelsior ! ' ."
18321,"i would have loved to chat with that guys before he passed , he did a good job with marvel ; lobbying that mutants are not people thus paying s lower rate to sell toys lol ."
18322,"yes , i know . also marvel published a generic comic book ' , in order to trademark the names 's upper hero ' and ' supervillain ' , they better ."
18323,"that is very interesting ! it was awesome chatting with you , have a great day !"
18324,good morning ? do you have a favorite superhero or comic book ?
18325,my favorite is superman
18326,did you know that the dc from dc comics stands for detective comics ?
18327,"i did n't know that , i was n't sure what it stood for ."
18328,marvel once published a generic comic book so they could trademark the names ' super hero ' and ' super villain ' .
18329,that 's some interesting information .
18330,i thought so too ! michigan state university as the largest publicly available comic cook collection in the world . never would have guessed that .
18331,"yea , i would have never guess that a university would have taht many comics . cool !"
18332,"stan lee , who recently passed away always ended his phone conversations with the word ' excelsior ! ' that 's an interesting . must be from one of his comic books ?"
18333,"yea , it must have been . guess he needed a catchphrase"
18334,lol yes . there was a garfield spinoff series named pet force . i do n't remember that . it featured him and the other characters as superheroes .
18335,yeh i never heard of that one before . i loved garfield .
18336,me yo . did you know that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the u . s . ?
18337,"i did not know that , interesting"
18338,yes . i thought so too . comic books were first popularized in the u . s . in the 1930s ' . i bet those original ones go for big money now .
18339,"i knee theyve sun around a long time , but did n't know hey were that old . you are correct , i bet the old ones are worth big money ."
18340,did you know that superheroine is another word for a female superhero ?
18341,"i did know that , i 've heard that before ."
18342,"there once was a superhero called normal , ah and he didnt have any superpowers . that 's funny !"
18343,"read that i funny , the only guy to is n't special is made out to eb special ."
18344,i agree ! lol it was nice chatting with you today !
18345,"i would really , the to hold a star . it is amazing there are some cold enough to hold ."
18346,the universe is amazing in its vastness .
18347,"yes , adn to think it may be one giant superhologram is jist beyond my comprehension ."
18348,i think that is a rather silly hypothesis posted by someone in new aoc research grant money and running out of ideas .
18349,very likely . i wonder if one of thye over 300 registered superheroes in he usa could intervene ? !
18350,have you eve seen that show on sci fi where they show real life superheroes around the world ? it is fascinating g .
18351,"no , i have not and usually i 'm not a scifi fan but i 'll have to fish that up , along with the garfield spin off where he was a superhero ."
18352,it is sad that we lost stand lee this last year . he was a great artist
18353,i agree . the creativity he took with him is one that i fear humanity is losing . arts ana imagination off the internet seems to be something society is rapidly refusing .
18354,"comic books were originally supposed to just be funny but i think they have evolved into so much more even giving guns hope in a time when things look bleak . we need , ore of that not less"
18355,"absolutely . i wonder how accessible michigan state university 's largest publicly available comic book collection in the world really is . that sounds like some bit of useless info i should have already heard by now ,"
18356,very 've . i 'm surprised that it is in michigan of all places . i would hae though new york or l . i find it amusing that dc comics is redundant since most of their character names are tha same letter for first and last
18357,"yeah , michigan . woo do . i 'm freezing where i am now far south of theresa nd am serious about digging into things i can watch this weekend avoid lousy weather ! here is actually a superhero called ' normalman . ' he wa she only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes . i think i need a desk plaque tthat reads ' normalman ' after learning that ."
18358,i think more people should be proud to be normalheroes and the world would be a rapper place .
18359,yeah . . . youve ot a point . my dog is a normaldoggo but he sure is happy lol . ;
18360,that 's funny . if only people were as loyal as our pets . imagine the things we would accomplish
18361,"i think society is so far grossed with the internet rather than legitimate human interaction it 's killing our ability to be decent humans to each other . we 're sitting here in the office now looking at the mess of germany unfolding and it 's insane to think we , as a species , kinda stalled around the 1950 's . comic books were first popularized in the united states and the united kingdom during the 1930s . what an amazing time that must have been to be alive"
18362,talking with people who lived during those times is amzing . we think of our problems las something tat has only happened here and now to but to listen to the stories of those times it is amazing that our grandparents and grea grandparents lived through . you can see it in the art and literature of the time as well .
18363,"that is very true . comic book legend stan lee ends every phone conversation he has it the word ' excelsior ! ' so in honor of this chat , i got ta end it with tht ! i to nice talking to you . and remember , there are still some good ' normalheroes ' left out here . : d"
18364,to all of u snormalheroes ! may we not be overtake by the media and making us try and confirm !
18365,yes ! haha maga
18366,hope you find the garfield series . it is very enjoyable .
18367,hey there have you seen the movie the black panther ? it came out in 2018
18368,i hav lot 's a really good movie . i really liked elicia wright 's role as sure . she was excellent .
18369,she did a good job . so did chadwick boseman . i did n't know the black panther is the wealthiest fictional marvel universe charater
18370,i did n't realize that either . i figured tony stark would have been nice r .
18371,"yep that 's what i would have thought , the black panther is worth about 500 billion , iron man is worth about 100 billion , and bruce wayne is worth about 80 billion"
18372,did you know that marvel 's use of he name actually predates the founding of the lack panther party ?
18373,"i always wondered where that came from . and i guess they are tried changing the name pf the character for a while so that it was n't associated with that group , but that did n't work obviously haha"
18374,"yeah they had changed it to ' black leopard , ' that just doesnt ' seem as fitting is black panther ."
18375,"nope it does't sound as good , it 's pretty cool that denzel washington helped outs chadwick boseman back in the say , and the chadwick gave him a shootout at the premiere"
18376,that is pretty cool . did you know tha 'the symbols and written script featured in the movie are based on an actual script called nsibdi ?
18377,"wow that 's good retention to detail , marvel comics is interesting though . back in 1998 they were tying to sell all of their characters to sony for only 25 million dollars , sony thought that was a bad idea because no one cared about any other character but spiderman , a nd they only got spiderman for 10 million , they must be kicking themselves now aha"
18378,"oh wow , that was a bad move on sony 's part . i learned that they successfully argued in court that mutants are not people ad thus got to pay the lower rate on xmen ' toys ' instead of the higher rate for dolls ."
18379,oh interesting . so that was what was going on with that . do you know th backstory of the superhero blue ear by chance ?
18380,yeah i heard about that . it was a very sweet thing they did for a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing is hearing aid me he told his mom that ' superheroes don ? t wear hearing aids ' so marvel created one .
18381,"yep tha to super nice of the mi this . is n't it weird that in mississippi , disney does not own the rights to show the big marvel characters ike xmen and spiderman , apparently they have a custom contract with universal studios in that specific state"
18382,"it 's actually parks east of the mississippi , so i 'm guessing mostly disney world in orlando ."
18383,"i must have read that wrong lol , do you like dc comics or marvel comics more by they way ? personally i like batman from dc , but the great i am all marvel"
18384,"i 'm more o ? marvel fan , but i do like a few dc characters though ."
18385,yep i agree with you there . is that funny that marvel published a ' generic comic book ' so thati hey could trademark the terms superhero and supervillain
18386,"neat 's pretty interesting . did you know that dc stands for detective comics , so there name is detective comic comics , kind of redundant huh ?"
18387,"haha that is very redundant . do you know who stan lee was ? anyway he way a big marvel boo creator , and would always end every phone conversation with the word ' excelsior '"
18388,good morning ! do you read comic books ?
18389,"good morning , no not really . do you ?"
18390,every now and then i do . i like marvel and some dc . it seems also bizarre tot dunk that the first comics in the country back in 1933 were just funny nad not super hero ones .
18391,"i guess everything evolves , eventually . interesting note , i did read that michael jackson tried at buy marvel comics so he could play spiderman in his own movie ."
18392,really ? that would have been interesting . i wonder if he would have put dance scenes in the movie !
18393,"i 'm sure he would have , no doubt ! j just found out today that google had purchased gmail . com from the garfield comics ! did you know that ?"
18394,"no i did n't . i used to read garfield but i don ' remeber any gmail in it . then again , i do n't remember much more than garfield an lasagna !"
18395,"i always thought gmail stood for google mail ? lol . talk bout a good deal , i har that dc comics paid 130 for superman in 1938 ."
18396,i thought it did too btw . so are you saying that he owned spiderman at one time ?
18397,"so , it would seem ? who knows marvel comics spent a decade trying to prove to the government that the xmen were not real . it 's a wacky universe , we love in !"
18398,yes it is ! marvel published a generic comic to of sorts at one time . they did that so the could trademark the names sueprhefo and supervillain n .
18399,that was super smart of them to do that ! i knoe the love for the super hero universe is big . di you know that at least 40 movies wit super heroes will b released between 2016 nad 2020 '
18400,i had n't realized there would be my many ! marvel takes their movies to a different super hero universe than in the comics . i guess that 's how they can make 'the story lines different in both and keep thins going .
18401,"speaking of hte universe , o you kno our universe used o be completely opaque ?"
18402,"no i did n't . so our universe used to look like fog , or thick white clouds ?"
18403,"yes l apparently , t here was so much plasma that the light could n't get through . do n't ask me how the scientists determined this fact !"
18404,lol ! i do n't but i do wonder ! scientists have some strange ideals ome times . i 've heard that there are some that think our universe is just one giant hologram .
18405,"i 've heard that one , as well as taht the universe exists inside a black hole or that a cold spot in the cosmic radiation could be an indication the it is a link to a parallel universe . i do n't know how they come up with these theories . it 's about emmy pay grade ."
18406,mine too . have you heard the one about there being only one electron in the universe ?
18407,"yes , i 've heard that crazy one , as well . bu t , then again , everybody used to think the world nwas flat !"
18408,so true ! there are still people that believe that one . i 'm going to go do some more research an see what other theories about the universe there are ! it 's been nice chatting with you ! h ave a great day !
18409,hello . what do you think of some scientists who think the universe may be a giant superhologram ? tht sounds so crazy to me .
18410,"yes , it does . something else hat is crazy , is that there are stars that are cold enough to b touched by the human hand ."
18411,neat would be so fun to do . even though i do n't believe the theory that states there is only one electron in the universe .
18412,there has been so many theories about the universe and its origins . i wonder if humans will eventually find thye answers . i have my doubts if we will ever get all the answers .
18413,"i do n't think we will , not in our lifetime l did you know there are over 300 superheroes in the us , alone ? i love the mcu ."
18414,yes i did . do you kno about normal man ? he is the only normal person on a planet full of superheroes .
18415,"was there , i didnt now . i recently found out that dc stands fo detective comics . who knew ?"
18416,i loved garfield as a kid . i found out recently he has a series wher the and his friends are superheroes .
18417,"garfield is hilarious . his comics are even in the michigan university library , they have the largest comic book collection in the world ."
18418,wow ! sounds like i should be a road trip tom china ! do you know how many comic books they have there ?
18419,"i do n't know . i have n't been to that campus . its funny that marvel published a generic comic book , so they could trademark ' super hero ' and ' super villain ' ."
18420,that does n't sound fair rio trademark those words because htey seem very commonly used words .
18421,"i guess the government felt differently . stan lee ends each phone call with excelsior , and his tweets as well . i miss him ."
18422,he was a true legend in his field . he even reimagined classics like batman and superman
18423,i remember that . he did a better own than their original creators .
18424,i was surprised to learn recently that the american comics only has roughly 10 percent of the world market .
18425,did you hear about the controversy over an actor playing catwoman ? they were trashing her because she is n't ' gay enough ' . i never knew woman was a lesbian .
18426,"wow , i did not know that either . i do n't see what the big deal is , i mean you na always have different actors with different interpretations of the same character . it makes it more interesting ."
18427,the actress i sa leia though . so came out at 12 . people are so weird .
18428,a lot of people are social justice warriors he feel that their viewpoint is always the right viewpoint . they want to be right instead of getting it right .
18429,"its az weir thing to harass an openly gay actor about . thanks for the chat , have a wonderful night ."
18430,"you too , bye"
18431,have you heard of the movie ' venom ' btw as directed by a guy who got influenced by seeing batman .
18432,i have heard of it but have n't seen it . did n't venom com from spiderman ?
18433,"i am not sure . it sounds like once he got into movies , he began as an assistant on dyson 's creek and met michelle williams . he also as directed the hit ' zombieland '"
18434,interesting . i think michelle williams was in dyson 's creek and it seems ike i 've heard she 's a venom too .
18435,i do n't know all of the superhero about there is a comic series about fixing gate collateral damage caused by the superheroes .
18436,yeah ? that would be cool to see in a movie . they could make it a comedy of sorts . speaking of superheroes did york no what theresa re over 300 registered superheroes in the united states ?
18437,"no i did n't until now . as a funny must , there is a ' normalman ' superheros at no powers on a planet full of superheroes with powers !"
18438,that would be funny ! i rule make a good movie too ! seems like i heard that all of this superhero stuff started back in the 1930s .
18439,that is true . stan lee related 15 dc comics . he recently wasted away so he did live to see them made into movies .
18440,"that 's good that he lived long though to see that . you know , i rememebr watching the batman movie thati adam michael keaton as batman . it was really goo and he was great . did you know that he would n't do a sequel ?"
18441,i did not know that ? i know at the time people gave him a lot of flack about the role . did you know that the war knight with kristian bale earned over a billion dollars when added with the sequel ?
18442,"no , i had no idea . imagine how good michael keaton 's could have done i few had a sequel then there probably would have been a this park at universal studios for batman ."
18443,george clooney nd val kilmer also played batman in other batman movies
18444,"yes they did . say , did you know that there were plans to market he green lantern into a comedy ?"
18445,i di n't know that . smallville was originally meant to tell the story of how bruce wayne becomes batman .
18446,really ? i 've seen a few episodes of smallville . i thought it was good . i think that russia has a version nor batman too .
18447,"speaking of comedies , did you know that 3rd rock from the un won the golden globe for est comedy in 1997 ? it beat out seinfeld , friends , and frasier !"
18448,"wow ! that 's impressive e ! those are all really good shows ! comedy must be hard to do and be successful at . i mean , comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since it began ."
18449,i also did not know that comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows .
18450,"it is pretty surprising . i wonder if they were ll the same type . i mean , i 've heard that here are different types of comedy ."
18451,i also like that he creator of the python programming language was named to honor the monty python comedy group . . . nice speaking with you .
18452,that 's really cool to know ! nice speaking with you too !
18453,have you seen the musical ' chess ' ? it is playing at the kennedy center and has a amazing cast .
18454,i do n't think i 've ever heard of it . what is it about ?
18455,i twin it has something l do with the cold war . it is set between 1972 and 1979 .
18456,that seems pretty interesting . speaking of dress do you know how to play ?
18457,"i know the rules but i have n't played in many years . i do n't recognize any of the songs from chess but , since it has parts about the rib and cia , it is a cold car thing . . ."
18458,"yeah , maybe a bit before my time . did ou know there are possible moves in chess than there are atoms in hte world ? that blows my mind ."
18459,i find that really herd to believe . the musical chess lasts 2 hours and 50 minutes . i 'm not sure i want to believe that .
18460,thats news like a ridiculously long time . i would definitely need a break between tha tone !
18461,stat nad a few drinks . . . i respect chess masters but i find the game rather boring . i would rather play backgammon it moves faster .
18462,it is definitely a slow game see did you know the resident of th federation of chess believes it was invented diy aliens ?
18463,for real ? that 's weird . . . did you know linkin park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone ? hard working people . . .
18464,"wow , that means they were doing almost one a day . crazy ! the ramones ave played a total of 2263 concerts . they toured lost on stop for 20 years !"
18465,that must be the inspiration for their song ' i want to be sedated ' .
18466,lol ! yoy might e light ! in 2002 a creed concert went so bad that 4 concert goers filed a lawsuit . i ponder ho had it must have been . .
18467,that 's pretty bad unless they were playing for a law school or something . di you know that r . reagan was to only president that was elected after being divorced ? i did n't . . .
18468,i did n't know that either . has n't donalds trump been divorced ?
18469,i think so . the article i read must be dated . i did learn that 6 of 15 presidents were lefthanded . reagan was ambidext5ous .
18470,that 's pretty interestin gf ronaldo ewan established national ice cream month !
18471,that 's pretty cool but i think many would disagree with him saying ice cream is nutrition .
18472,"yeah , that 's probably not entirely true . he also won 49 out o 50 states !"
18473,that was nice a victory . thanks for the chat !
18474,hi do you like chess ?

18480,wow did not know there iss such a thing . the president of the federation believes that chess was invented by aliens
18481,hat is pretty weird . i did enjoy watching a magician beat 9 leasing chess players simultaneously by replicating their moves against each other at each table !
18482,wow . judit polgar was so good at it that he beat a family friend at the game was nthe was 5 and did not even look at the board
18483,that is seriously impressive . i am just happy to know how the prices move and that a knight can visit each square exactly once
18484,yeah 3d id york mow there is a negative correlation between the iq and chess skills ?
18485,really ? i would have thought you needed to . pretty smart to play chess ! but maybe not since pawns no longer have their own names like they used to
18486,yeah . i guess so . do you know where the game was invented ?
18487,india i believe and it became more modern in spain in the 1960s
18488,yes it was india during the gupta empire and i was improved by the persians ; alter
18489,the rules however were not standardized until the 19th century

18502,interesting . . . i did n't know that either . i saw it was the 53rd disney animated film .
18503,that 's a lot of animated films . frozen minds me of hockey because of the ice . canada is the only country in the word with two national sports : lacrosse and ice hockey .
18504,that 's pretty cool . i love lacrosse . i played that in high school .
18505,oh nice . do you like ice hockey ? a n . hockey ring remains under basketball court when switching stadium sports !

18547,i have never seen lacrosse ! i like to watch the ice dancers when the olympics are on . i like that the brazilian bobsled team disc called frozen bananas .
18548,that 's funny ! h ahha this might sound silly bu what is the difference between lacrosse and field hockey ?
18549,i have no idea actually . did you ever wathc curling ? htey use brooms to move weights across the ice . i think it is popular in maine and canada .
18550,i 've see that on the olympics . funny you say maine i had cousins there when i was growing up . we went there to visit them and that was th first time i ever saw field hockey and was shocked that it was a school sport . lol

18556,ha ! just ? s awesome ! i 'm going to have to rememebr stat next time i see one . so since you play soccer . . . did you know that soccer makes more money than all of the other big sports combined ?
18557,i read that . i guess its because the game is universal . i like it better than hockey because the boston bruins seem to only want to right with the othe teams .
18558,lol a hockey player was traded for 1 in 1993 and went on to win 4 stanley cups . wonder who that it i 'm lol i just went by my son turned on the white robin the sink and said ' look at the bubble ' he looked at me like somthing was wrong with me and did n't say nothing . . . just walked away shaking his head .

18560,"lol have a nice way : ,"
18561,"hello , were you aware that elsa wa originally a villain in frozen ?"
18562,"no , that 's sounds odd . did you know frozen was originally named snows queen just it was changed due to the beliefs hat feminine titles under performed"
18563,"it does sound weird , though it was only after le tit go was wrote , that they changed her character . that sounds like something disney would do ."
18564,"yea , i do n't think frozen would have made 1 billion if they kept her a villain"
18565,"honestly , i 've never see it . i 've never seen wreckit ralph either ."
18566,i his n't seen it either but it 's pretty cool alan tudyk has had roles in every disney animated film since wreck it steph
18567,"that is cool , i liked his character in zootopia ."
18568,i find it pretty cool robert lopez did work for sloth park before writing for frozen
18569,"i knw he cowrote the book of mormon , . but i did n't kow about south park ."
18570,"yea , lopez has wrote al ot of songs , he even wrote for an episode o scrubs"
18571,"i think eh wonka n egot for he scrubs episode , i do n't remember correctly though ."
18572,"lopez is pretty talented , he has won an egot , emmy , grammy , oscar , and tony !"
18573,i do n't think john legend has won all of those . ahve you seen avenue q or
18574,no but i heard lopez did a great job on t and book of mormon too
18575,do you follow hockey ? i heard hey can lose almost 8 pounds per game .

18577,"that in a lot of water weight . do all stadium , s hav . hockey ring turner their basketball courts ?"
18578,"no , just ones that have a basketball and hockey team sharing the arena like madison square garden does witht he knicks and rangers"
18579,"dos america have professional lacrosse teams ? canada does , its one of their national sports ."
18580,i think there is a professional lacrosse league but it is nowhere near as popular of known as lacrosse is in canada

18586,"i do love disney movies . you know , w hen sleeping beauty flopped at the box offic , they lost shut down their entire animation studio . i 'm so thankful they did n't !"
18587,i know . we would have been robber of so many great movies . they did flop it treasure planet though .
18588,i wonder if it was as bad as trojan wars ? it only earned 309 t the box office despite having a budget of 15 million . that 's kind of depressing .
18589,yeah . imagine being the lead on that and get those reviews and results back . so depressing !
18590,"so kidding ! i ind of wish they 'd make am movie about taht computer the russians made back in 1936 that ran on water . that is crazy , is n't it ?"
18591,"yeah , like a space shuttle running on only 1mb of ram !"
18592,that would be interesting as well ! i think the best horror movie would be about those transhumanist people do wish to upload their minds to memory sticks and computers . ha !
18593,right ? i do n't want your brain on a stick . . . do you smoke ?
18594,"no kidding ! ha ! if i did smoke , i would n't wat to do it around apple computers because it makes the a biohazard and voids hte warrenty ."
18595,that ; s right ! but do n't smoke regardless . . . it 's gross is would you build a working compute route of minecraft blocks ?
18596,"i wish i could but i 'm not as brilliant as the person who did that . i 'd rather just build a space ship and go to the moon . ha ! speaking of the moon , did you know there 's actually evidence of methane based life on one of saturn 's moons named titan ?"
18597,"no , i did not . that 's really interesting . mar 's moo n , phobos is 1 or 3 hollow ."
18598,thats pretty interesting ! i also find it interesting that highest point on our moon is 1938 meters higher than mt . everest . 8 'm surprised no one 's tries to climb it yet . ha !
18599,yeah . i would probably be easier . . . with no gravity . . . . you could also look down on the people who only climbed everest . . . .
18600,exactly . ha ! i 'd just year being hit by mon did as it can cut through mevlarlike material an causes the moon hay fever disease . so i would have to pass on climbing the moon 's highest point .
18601,"what if it gave you super powers though . . . liek the ability to run , p really high ?"
18602,"that would be cool . ha ! well speaking of the moon , did you also know as ahead considered placing a un flag on the moon instead of the us flag , months before apollo 11 ?"

18604,hey there have you ever played hear ? i used to b really good at it when i was younger
18605,"oh , yes ! i love chess . have you ever played with the bard that allows 3 people ? that seem intense ."
18606,"no i never played that ! but it sounds pretty awesome lol . it 's also awesome that there are more possible moves in chess than there are atoms in the universe , that seems insane"
18607,"wow , that is so crazy . i ca n't believe chess has been around since before the 7th century , either . what a rich history !"
18608,"that is a lot time ! did you ever play by the way ? apparently th rules were standardized in the 19th century , even though like you mentioned , it has existed in smoke way or another since the 7th"
18609,i have played . i love most strategy games like chess and mash jong . but i 'm definitely no barren brown .
18610,"can you tell me about barren bron ? all i know about chess is that he ; le like bobby fischer are good , also judit vulgar is really good too , i bought one of her books when i was studying chest"
18611,barren bron was actually a magician ! he beat nine of the best chess players in existence at the same time by replicating each o theirs overs against each other i very game .
18612,"wow that 's incredible ! h e sounds really good . on a separate note though , what do you think about concerts ? do you ever go to them ?"
18613,i love concerts . i saw depeche mode recently . i 've also seen dave matthews .
18614,"oh yeah those are both really good . i really liked lollapalooza which way a big music festival or concert that i went to last was . i also like they ramones , did you now that they have been touring nonstop for 20 years ?"
18615,"woah , that 's super cool . trey play pretty loudly , too . i wonder if they play as loud as deep purple . in 1972 , three audience enders passed out fro the sound . they like the world record !"
18616,"that 's scary ! i would have hates that concert because i hate really loud music personally even though i do go to concerts lol . i would go to the amphitheater in croatia though , they were probably be respectful with spoken there"
18617,"if you do n't like loud concerts , you probably would 've loved the one of reed had in 2010 . him and his wife held one for dogs , so the music was only a high frequency that they could hear ."
18618,"yeah i would hav beloved that haha ! that way i could n't have heard anything lol . i also would not have liked to go to that creed concert , yo know , the one where they were sued because the concert wa soso bad lol"
18619,"i have n't heard about that , but i coul believe it ! speaking of people who were n't appreciated , air you know that ronald reagan lost a movie job because seth producer did n't think he looked ' presidential ' . talk about irony !"
18620,"wow talk abou ta bad call lol . it 's interesting to , that e is the only president to be elected after previously being divorced . i wonder why that is"
18621,and that people voted for him ! he was the original flipflopper considering hd reagan hi starter as a democrat !
18622,"you 're right ! i think it 's awesome though that he called dice cream ' a nutrition candw holes , e food ' and create national ice cream month , now that 's something i can get behind haha"
18623,he must 've had a tremendous sweet tooth . apparently jelly belly created the lbueberry flavor as for him .
18624,that 's awesome ! i wish i had someone to make a jelly bean flavor after me lol . it 's interesting to that he was ambidextrous m you do n't meet many people tha are
18625,"what do you think abut the cast of chess , ?"
18626,i actually have n't seen it . hav eyou ?
18627,"i havent seen it either but i am exited , i think murray head ha a lot of talent and the eisenhower theater is also amazing ."
18628,i really like the game of chess ? do you play ? did you know there are more possible moves in a game of acess than there are atoms in the known universe
18629,"really ! ! that many ? wow , countless o strategies then , i dont play but have respect for those who do , it looks hard ."
18630,it cain be depending n your partner . ther is so much to think about som any options so many moves . chess wash invented in india
18631,is it true the president of the chess federation thinks the game was invented by aliens ?
18632,"haha i have no clue , i gues sit wouldnt surprise me . i wonder why he thinks that or what evidence he has to support hat theory ."
18633,"mate because od the complexity of the game , there is also an iq correlation with strong chess players ."
18634,i i sure . grandmaster judit polgar beat a 5 year old without looking at the board .
18635,"thats crazy , he had a memorized strategy l so to you like music , have you attended any concerts lately ?"
18636,"i do like music . i have benz to any concerts lately though , have you ?"
18637,"i havent been to any concers lately either , i sure want to go to a ramones concert , even thouhg they played a total of 2263 concerts i wasnt able to go to one ."
18638,"that is a ton of concerts , i cant imagine living out of suitcases for so long , they must hav love it ! hope they make a lot of money !"
18639,"the might , thy are a pretty good band , i also waned to attend da linking park concert but that seems impossible no w ."
18640,"yeah linkin park did 324 concerts one year ! they way a great band , i wish i couldve aw them too ."
18641,"yeah , their debut album was great i really liked it , another band i used to like was creed ."
18642,i dont think i know who they are . and did ? what are some of their songs ?
18643,"some of their bests songs are ' my sacrifice ' and ' niger ' you should look them up , too bad the band started having problem , in 2002 they gave a concert tht was n't up to their usual standards ."
18644,"oh right , their fans filed a lawsuit , that is unfortunate . must have been really bad !"
18645,"yeah , i wonder why because they have pretty good songs maybe the band was out of tune n didnt rehearse properly ."
18646,do you play chess
18647,i used to whe . was younger . it is a pretty strategic game and i am impressed by peopel that play it professionally .
18648,i always wanted to pay in the park of nyc
18649,u have always seen that on tv and in movies . that would be fun . i wonder if they hav 'the version of chess that allows 3 players to play against each other .
18650,i do n't think so because of how the board is built .
18651,did you kno wthe cheese is thought to have originated out of a one that was played in india ? i never would hve thought that .
18652,there were many games hat were derivation from the indian game of chaturanga
18653,oh really ? do you know what those other games were ?
18654,i think one can janggi and the other shows
18655,"wo w , i have heard of those games . i ca n't believe chess has been played in europe since the 9th century ."
18656,the number of possible moves makes it very difficult to master
18657,"yep , and in chess the knight can only visit each square once during z game ."
18658,i believe the world press president is a bit crazy .
18659,why do you say that ?
18660,he believes the game was invented by aliens rather than indians
18661,"wow , that is crazy ."
18662,the current grandmaster has been playing since he was 5
18663,"wow . i never would have thought they started that young . however the boy scouts hav in merit badge for chess now , so i guess youngsters do p , ay regularly ."
18664,"i did not realize that . that is great for the boy scouts since they are now for their outdoor type activities ,"
18665,"they also have merit bridges for geocaching , robotics , and inventing . is is nice to see the branching out to include kids with all kinds of interests ."
18666,i will have to look it up . i used to be a boy scout and do n't remember all those badge .
18667,do you like movies ?
18668,"yeah , does n't everybody ."
18669,th cereal question is do you like horror ?
18670,never really been a big fan of horror movies . how about you ?
18671,i find it a hit or miss . it is interesting you can burn up to 180 calories by watching horror movies
18672,that crazy maybe i need to start watching more horror movies . lol . maybe i ca close a wow pounds .
18673,did you know that creepy reverberating metallic noise is created y a waterphone ?
18674,i had no idea that that even j it be honest with you . i did hear that watching a horror film before viewing abstract art will make you enjoy the art more . crazy huh .
18675,the waterphone is kind of ike a ton of tuning folks attached to a circular ring that vibrate as you ca the songs
18676,oh thats good to know . so im guessin hey use that to make the noises in the horror films .
18677,ya but i feel horror is subjective . the actor in the shining did n't know he was in a horror film nunti lseverla years later
18678,"that is true . when i was a kid htey scared md , now i find most of them either just stupid and funny , instead of scary ."
18679,"i never thought o bambi as a horro film , it i see stephen king 's pony sine if not animated , the film is quite dark"
18680,i guess when they show the momma deer it was kind of dark . the us not it does n't really seem too bad . i guess it has been a long time since i have seen it thoug h
18681,i mean the bird kind of made it better . generally disney use bird and cute animals to bring a lighter tone to movies also like in sleeping beauty
18682,to think about it that makes a lot of use . i guess birds lot have a way of making people feel better .
18683,"they have a beautiful voice , but sometime they can mimic sound of car farms and chainsaws . if you heard any such sounds randomly in australia , i try probably just birds not jason"
18684,"lol . thats good to , now in case i ever go to australia . birds really are amazing creatures . home even migrate from alaska all the way to mexico without sleeping . thats amazing ."
18685,"i winder how many is the trip is . as maziknga s nature is to create such magnificent creatures , birds can be jerks too . hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to build their nest . too bad sadder ."
18686,dont hurt my feelings any . they can kill all the spiders they wan to .
18687,"lol . i any case , thank you for the humorous chat ."

18734,what was your favorite movie this year ? king kong was he of mine in the past . meryl streep auditioned for the lead role in the 1976 one .
18735,"i ca n't say any stand out right now , but i would like to see he mr . rogers documentary"
18736,"oh , i loved his now . he was a great ; person who spoke at congress to made sure they did n't drop funding for pbs . i wonder hat he would think of the world today . do you watch horror ? i heard they use a waterphone for much of the three ; y music ."
18737,i am afraid of horror . danny from the shining did n't even know he was in a horror film until several years afterwards
18738,"hmm , i guess he did n't read the script . since he was so young i guess his parents got all of his pay . i heard meryl streep 's first film role was a sports movie . do you like sports ?"
18739,i love sports ! streep was called ugly kin italian in er first audition for king kong to which she understood the italian and replied back 5o he producer
18740,i friend doof mine an di were on vacation in germany and more on a hiking trip with a german group back in the 70s . we were makings jokes about hem in english in the were all german . later oh do the germans said ' are you from america ' in perfect english . howe embarrassing .
18741,you ca n't ever be too careful . did you know that meryl streep ha aa daughter who i san actress playing an fbi agent on mr . robotgrace bummer ?
18742,i was wondering about that . i love that show . i have seen every season . i thought she looks like streep . do you like hummingbirds ; w e have a feeder at myth used . i heard they make their nest partially from spider webs .
18743,"wow , i 've seen som . they are amazing how fast they flap . most birds bone spare so hollow that their entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers ."
18744,i love to watch cultures big in the sky as they felt in circles or hours without flipping their wings . i bought an ric sailplahne so i can fly like tha . crows do it pro in a limited way . have you see any cultures up high ?
18745,"sometimes . that is amazing o watch ! speaking of watching , you can burn 180 calories watching a horror film ."
18746,"hmm , that is a good ay to lose weight if you do n't eat popcorn at the same time . did you read the book the shining ? i cant believes stephen king thought bambi was a horror movie ."
18747,"i saw the movie the shining i believe . disney movies have been creepy at times . it could see how bambi losing his mother i na fire could be horrific ! they say that if you watch a horror movie before viewing abstract art , you 'll enjoy the art more . i guess it heighten your senses ."
18748,i note abstract art . i like impressions and realism . i ca n't believe they get millions of collars for stuff that looks like it took them 5 minutes and just threw paint around . did you know horror has been a films one for over one hundred years ?
18749,wow ! edgar allan poe and mary shelley have some timeless classics in horro r .
18750,i heard poe had a fear of being buried alive . theyd id n't knw back then tha people could be unconscious to the point tey have weak vital signs . so some were buried in coffin nd woke up rapped until they ran out of air andre really died . i wonder if meryl streep who ha beet nominate for 21 academy awards has been in a horro film .
18751,"that is creepy but a bit paranoid . but perhaps if the dodo bird thought of that , maybe it would ave survived extinction ."
18752,"i there , how are you ? hae you ever read washington irving 's ' sleepy hollow ' ?"
18753,i real it in school actually . it is a good story . the heartless horseman was freaky
18754,genetic theater has turned it into a play . it would be interesting to see it in theater format .
18755,"i saw the movie many years ago , and i agree , i would be great as a play . i wonder how they do the heartless horseman join he ; lay ."
18756,"i 'm sur then do it through costume design . i think his version of the play is a little different tha nthe traditional story , adding ar and a romantic rivalry ."
18757,"wel li like when people do different interpretations . it will still have the basics im sure , such as cobo can . i remember hi being kin of a us in the original ."
18758,haha it in he was kind of a just as well . i this interpretation he 's kin doof a thug andc an out with a bunch of army guys . i guess they toughened him up a bit .
18759,they also made a play about edgar allen poe called nevermore . it was a musical
18760,hmm interestin a it 's good to know that texas has theater . i had no idea . prices are n't bad either .
18761,texas theatre might be a little ness stuck up than ther theatre communities . they probably serve beer and bb during the show
18762,that would be amazing ! do you think the one a real horse on stage ?
18763,"ha . i doubt it . i think they would use actors or puppy ; steers . ,"
18764,"you never know , horses have been used in a ton of movies ."
18765,"true , but i can imagine they would be harder to control on stage in front of an audience . i see a big risk for an accident"
18766,"true , we have been domesticating hem for thousand of years though . so , e even use to work with firefighters ."
18767,horses re amazing creatures . people have been using them since 4000 bc
18768,"yeah , i don ' know i feel about people being them for sport . are you a fan ?"
18769,"never cared much about horse robin . . i think horses are great creatures , but i would rather watch other forms of racing"
18770,"me too , i think it 's a rough life for them . did you see the new movie bohemian rhapsody ?"
18771,"i have not , but i am a big fan of queens . how was it ;"
18772,it as pretty awesome . i was listening to their greatest hits album recently . freddie mercury has a great voice .
18773,he was an amazing performer who died todo you1
18774,"hi , how are you tonight ? do you go to concerts much ?"
18775,i do go to concerts sometimes . the last concert i went to was lollapalooza . what about you ? do you ever go to concerts ? i 've always wanted to go to linkin park concert personally
18776,"i used to go when i was younger , but to , not so much . no time , little money . how was linkin park ?"
18777,"well i always wanted to go to a linkin park concert . i never actually went so far , i just know that they tour a lot , for instance in 2001 they did 324 shows"
18778,how did they that ? ! 324 is an astounding gnome be they must not have slept . or they were young nd full of energy . too bad about their lead singer .
18779,"yep i agree , it 's too bad that he 's gone now . it 's crazy to that the ramones played 2200 concerts in about 0 years , i would definitely check them out as well"
18780,how rich are they ? they must be rolling in dough . the fans must love them to support 20 years of touring . i guess new fans have appeared every generation .
18781,"oh they 're definitely loaded lol . i really would like to see a concert in the ancient roman amphitheatre , it 's still in fused may and it 's in croatia"
18782,i think that 's guess ! i wonder how comfortable the seats are though . the acoustics must be interesting as well . i wonder if the ramones ever played here .
18783,i wonder that too ! would you ever see creed in concert ? i read that they were sued because people were displeased with their concert
18784,"i wondr if the fans won their lawsuit , or if the band settled . the case many have had merit , in which case i would n't be surprised i 'the band decided to stop decordign and touring ."
18785,"i know right lol they should take that ws a hint haha . do you like pink floyd a tall ? they apparently played at na amphitheatre , and i would have loved to have seen that"
18786,floys is great . i woul have loved to watch them play . but why an empty stadium ? were the acoustics better ?
18787,i know right lol i hope they recorded it on tv for everyone to see though . but maybe not cuz they were kind of weird haha . have yo ever scenes the movie frozen by the way ?
18788,"have n't seen frozen . heard of it . supposed to be good , with lots of good songs . have you seen it ?"
18789,i have see nit . it 's ok . its ot the best movie that disney ever made in my opinion . i do know that the director was the first director of a disney animated movie though
18790,"women don ' f get mange opportunities to direct , i know . i think the movie probably needed a woman 's touch . it 's about a princess , right ?"
18791,"it is about a princess . i ca n't believe you have n't heard the song let it go , that was like a huge song on that movie first came out , and apparently they changed the mai character to go with that song so that she was good instead of being evil , because she was going to be evil initially"
18792,i guess i 'm old and out of touch ! lol . i think that it must have been a powerful song for hem to change the character around that way .
18793,i need to see the movie . just to let you catch up with the times maybe haha . do you listen to adele by he way ?
18794,i do n't know adele . is she a singer ?
18795,"yep she 's a singer . she did the theme for the move skyfall , you remember the one at james bond adn everything . apparently daniel craig started crying when he first heard that theme"
18796,"hi , ho are you doing today ? do you go to concerts much ?"
18797,"hello there , i am well thank you . i do like to go , but i have n't been going as much as i would like to , how about you ?"
18798,i used to go . not so much to . not much tim do money . do you know the band linkin park ?
18799,"yeah the time is the real issue now days . an yeah i have heard of them , how about you ?"
18800,i dont ' really know their music . i 'm impressed that linkin park played 324 concets in 2001 alone . that 's some stamina .
18801,that is a crazy schedule or one year of touring ! wow !
18802,they must have made a mint . the fans must have been happy too .
18803,yeah i guess if you were a fan chances are they would be playing a show somewhere neat you that year .
18804,hte ravens have played a ton of concerts as well . i expect heir fans woul debt happy too .
18805,yeah hosue guys are pretty good as well . did you know that ; ou reed an his wife one held a high frequency concert for dogs ?
18806,i guess the dogs appreciated that ? i dunno . why ? was it for publicity ? in 2002 a creed concert sas so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band . i hope the doh didnt hue lo reed .
18807,"yeah that sounds pretty sad , it sounds like they did n't like the show , so do n't buy another ticket , simple ."
18808,"i gues , b ut maybe they felt cheated and wanted to wear 'the band a lesson . i 've been to bad concerts , ut a lawsuit is a lot of headache and time ."
18809,"yeah same here , and to me there cars too many peole suing too may otter people these days ."
18810,"in croatia , there is an ancient roman amphitheatre that is still in use as a concert venue . i wonder wat bigname acts play there now ."
18811,i think that is so cool . i guess they do say thing were built to last back then .
18812,that 's true . . would you play a concert to an empty stadium like pink floyd ?
18813,"i think i wouldnt mind doing that yeah , it would be a nice change of pace ."
18814,i gues she adjusts at have been exquisite . or the band was high on drugs .
18815,"that and probably both , i am a big pink floyd fan , but most of their first album ."
18816,i know a new of their songs . i ' v hear they did great concerts . i would love to have the to one .
18817,"yeah same here , i would of loved to have seen syd barrett perform with the band live . it was nice cahttingb with you today , i hope you have a good one !"
18818,"hey did you know that pink f , boyd recorded a concert once to no audience ?"
18819,"pink floyd tried to push the boundaries , man . they would record wherever they had to , man , to get the sound , ma n , that htey had to for their audience , man . floyd was the man , man"
18820,"haah flood is awesome , and y that concert was in an ancient you , an amphitheater , only they would do tha ahaha"
18821,what about the amphitheater in croatia ? they forgot about that ! it is still in use !
18822,oh ya they should have played tthat one to with no audience ! do you like the ramones ?
18823,"i have heard their music , i have listened to their music . and yet i do not know this music . do you know their music ?"
18824,"i have heard their music , i 'm not crazy about them , but i do respect their touring , over 2000 shows in 10 years is a lot"
18825,they must have used some special drugs designed by the government ! i think that htey measure up to linkin park !
18826,"oh totally , that linkin park played 324 concert in a year aka almost one per day is pure insanity !"
18827,the kids know how to keep up the momentum ! i was i had their energy !
18828,"i know right ! what i would be embarrased with is being sued for having bad concerts , like creed was , thats embarrassing haha"
18829,that creed concert sounded really unenjoysble ! i would have sued too !
18830,"haha i agree , i do n't like creed so maybe i ' biased but that is bad ! do you like the singer adele ?"
18831,i do n't now who that is . i ma sorry about that was she sued by her fans ?
18832,"hahano os he 's a famous singer , she did the theme for the movie skyfall , apparently daniel craig started crying when he first heard that"
18833,daniel craig i head cries a lot . i 'm not surprised !
18834,lol he definitely does n't compare to sean connery when it comes to jame bond
18835,he tries his best . we can not all be sean . every bond has his has . there will be a female and one day .
18836,"haha he i think so , back to adele she said the spice girls were a major influence on her , which i do like the spice girls haah"
18837,"do n't know the space its , but i do know spice it anyways , thanks for the chat ! stay safe ! stays foolish ! stay groovy"
18838,haha you stay groovy too ! ya check out the spice girls they have som catchy songs !

18841,"simpler times my friend simpler times . i can not play the piano , except for some of chopsticks , lol !"
18842,haha . freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney did to record hey jude .
18843,that sounds cool . there was an aluminum piano tilt for the lounge of the hindenburg that weighed 356 lbs .
18844,i would love t see that ! in 2006 a group of climbers found a piano when they reached thet op of britain 's highest mountain .
18845,"sounds strange but o , . do you know who bartolomeo cristofori was ?"
18846,no i do n't think so . who ?
18847,"he invented the acoustic , stringed musical instrument back in the 1700 with the strings were struck by hammers ."
18848,oh . okay . do you like to read ?
18849,"yeah but mostly audible book now , you . ? i hear the fda burned ton sofa literature as an act of censorship ."
18850,"i 'm sure they did ! did you now architecture , literature , music , painting nd sculpture are olympic events from 1912 to 1952 ."
18851,"wow , again simpler times my dried ew ow i did not know that romantic kissing is a fairly recent development ."

18854,i wonder too . i have not ridden q horse in a very long time .

18856,haha i wonder ! d ? id you know dalmations are port of tune fire department because they used to be used to keep the horses calm and to also protect them ?
18857,wow i did not but that makes sine because dogs ave been a great contributor to man . apparently the horse is one ot two extant subspecies of equus ferus .
18858,"oh , i did not know that . sounds pretty amazing . i know horses were domesticated in a widespread manner by 3000 bc , so they have been around people for a long time ."
18859,"funny note , two high school kids road horses rio school jonn o vehicle day , hilarious !"
18860,that is funny ! it was good chatting . bye .

18865,"i did n't , however i believe i coudl contend with that one ! did you ever read sleepy hollow ?"
18866,no i have not but seems kind of creepy . . . ind of dark . . i did imagine the dark forest with a ghosthly horses and horseman . . . did you read it ?
18867,"i did read it , il love horror novels . the way they described everything wit such detail was amazing . the crimes that ichabod france did in the story , there no wonder why he made back ."

18884,"indeed she is an impressive singer and songwriter a he has 109 platinum so far in both th is and uk , a impressive achievement"
18885,exactly ! she also won the best ne artist and best female pop vocal performance in 2009 . i relate to her because she is shy and has a hard time looking into the camera when she performs .
18886,she has a wonderful singing voice . her skyfall him even brought daniel craig top tears
18887,"yes , i have hard hat too . some of her early influencers were the spice girls . that is pretty funny since they do not have the same sound at all !"
18888,her album 21 is still the biggest selling uk album of the 21st century
18889,"yep , she is the best ! my you1 daughter and i watched the movie frozen for the first time today . t was so cute ! it is actually the 53rd disney feature film ."
18890,do you enjoy animated disney films ?
18891,"do , we usually do . this ne was extra cute . it grossed over 1 billion in box office revenue . did you see it ?"
18892,i didd enjoy how disney made the movie more kid friendly while maintaining a good story . also frozen is the first disney animated film with a female director
18893,"yes , i also had heard that the name was changed from snow queen to frozen based on previous feminine film titles underperforming a 'the box office ."
18894,i wonder if that is a coincidence . weak almost never had elsa as we know it if let it go was n't so uplifting . that show alone changed her from the main villain to protagonist
18895,"yes , that is weird ! disney also changed the movie rapunzel to the nba etagnled for the same reason , low sales ."
18896,"i personally enjoy music , which is why i though let it go was a wonderful song . do you enjoy music and concerts as well ?"
18897,"yes , i love music too ! live music is usually the best play for a date night for my husband and i . what about you ?"
18898,i to to go on ay to go listen to a concert using a ancient roman amphitheater as a venue .
18899,that woudl be cool . i had learned that pink floyd recorded a live concert in pompeii once .
18900,"too bad they had no audience . i also enjoy linkin park and ramones . they have both played hundreds if not thousands of concerts , attempting to their skill"
18901,"yes , i woudl like tos 's linkin park live one day . it 's too late to see the ramones though ."
18902,at least t wasnt ' a creed concert . i heard 4 were so bad that lawsuits were filed . i wonder if it was the problem of the band or venue
18903,yikes ! time to find a good concert to se ethics weekend ! see ya .
18904,thank you for the lovely chat .
18905,"hello , let 's talk about venom"
18906,hello . sure . i believe tom hardy plays venom for the movie .
18907,"yes and ' venom , ' which represents sony 's effort to build its own superhero universe , which is nice"
18908,chicago tribute wrote that it is a mess but a really funny and fascinating mess . . .
18909,"yes , did you know that in ' venom , ' which opens friday , hardy plays both eddie rock , a bay area digital journalist ?"
18910,"yes , i heard about it . do you like superheroes in general ?"
18911,"yes alot , do you know robin fischer ?"
18912,not really . can ou itll me more about him ?
18913,"i learned that the result , as directed ny washington native gruden fischer , ' zombieland ' , , can play like a onemanb muddy picture that simmons comparison to ' liar , liar ' an d ' all of me ' , interesting , right ?"
18914,"right . but the hollywood reporter , too , describes ' venom ' as a throwback of a superhero movie . i am curious about the movie now : ,"
18915,"me too , have you heard about the chicago tribute ?"
18916,"no , what did they say ?"
18917,"a real mess of a movie is ' so much more thrilling that any of the formulaic superhero movies that are through multiplies all year . , that 's what been said . do you agree ?"
18918,"i agree . the new york post has the farthest review in which calls this assemblyline product ' a disaster on every level , from the hatch job writing to hte horrid performances ' that puts ' its focus on juvenile humor instead of heart or action . ' . that is too harsh i believe ."
18919,yes i agree with you . did you watch spiderman 3 ?
18920,"no , i did not . was it good ?"
18921,no it is not good in my opinion . ' spiderman 3 ' is aggressively loud and stupid without being much fun at all .
18922,"ah , good to know , thanks . i will not waste my time on it then . which superhero is your favorite ?"
18923,which is your favorite superhero ?
18924,ironman i think . . .
18925,"i like superman , do you heard about marvel comics ?"
18926,have you seen the movie ' venom ' ? tom hardy played a dual role ut only scored a 3 percent fresh rating on rotten tomatoes .
18927,"i did , i thought it was a great movie , i think the ratings arent fair r , did you watch it ?"
18928,i have n't seen it but the chicago tribute seemed to like it although they thought it was a mess of a movie .
18929,"you should watch it , its actually a good movie , it is fun andc he leading actor is great he plays hte role of venom and of eddie in style"
18930,i may . i seldom listen to critics . it is surprising that the hollywood reported said btw as ' thoroughly irredeemable . '
18931,"it seems like a harsh review , i know marvel movies are in another leage but still calling it the poor cousin seems way out of line ."
18932,not all the reviews were bake . uproar said that the though venom has potential for cultmoviwe status .
18933,"yeah dig suess their review was more accurate , its not a great movie but it is a fun movie to watch ,"
18934,would you go to a movie for a superhero ' normalman ' a guy with no superpowers surrounded by those that do ?
18935,"i dont thin i would pay for that lol , seems a bit absurd , although he must be a badass to be a real without powers kind of like batman ."
18936,"i watched a video of batman that wa made during wwii , 1943 , . i guess that 's the batman that stan lee reimagined when he worked on dc stuff ."
18937,"i havent watched that one i might look it in youtube later , stan lee did write 15 dc comics reimagining superheroes ."
18938,there is one character the dc and marvel both own . i wonder what one it is ? they like to keep things separate .
18939,"actress is the name of the hero , and yeah i agree , both universes leon in different spaces ."
18940,"speaking of universes , there are people that thin the universe is one big superhologram ."
18941,"that seems like to crazy theory to me , but who knows , theres a lot we dont know about the universe and its wonders ."
18942,heres ' another : there is theory that th universe contains only one electron . that 's one heel sofa n electron !
18943,"it is , also sounds like a crazy theory just like how universes evolve though natural selection"
18944,there are also a crazy amount of superhero in the u . s . the number is 300 . how many cab lol name ? i cold n't even get lose .
18945,"300 of them ? i bet i cold name at least 20 ! garfield was a superhero once ,"
18946,"a cat , why not ? thanks for the chat , you were great ."
18947,did you watch venom ?
18948,"9 did n't , but i have some friends who went and saw it . i 've heard many people enjoyed it"
18949,"i though it was a nice movie , the starring actor was nominated to a academy award , h e acre wall in the movie ."
18950,"venom is one of the most complex characters in the marvel universe , so it 's so surprising that people felt like them view as an enjoyable mess"
18951,"well it was a challege o mix all elements in a proper way but sony didnt dissa0oint and managed to o so , the movie recieved bat ratings though ,"
18952,"maybe th problem is n't the movie itself , but that the movie was released at a time when other marvel characters are getting more attention due to their connection to a bigger storyline"
18953,"yea that makes sense but still it got a rating of 28 in rotten tomatoes and a score of 35 out off 0 fin netacritic , i have to say i disagree witht hose rating of the movie"
18954,"it might bed leg to his origin story though . plus , he 's not really a hero nor is he a villain m so many do n't know what to do with thye charater . there are many other superhero movies set to release in the next wo years"
18955,"yeah im exited to watch the movie marvel will release this year , captain marvel ewing on of them do you like marvel studios ?"
18956,i do enjoy marvel movies . i think disney acquiring marvel entertainment ha sheer for the better . dd you know they created a superhero just to encourage a young boy to wear his hearing aids ?
18957,"i didnt know that , i do think its a great deed , there is also a superhero called normalman lol"
18958,"of course there is . back in the 90s , michael jackson tried to by the comic because he wanted to portray spiderman in his own movie"
18959,"that would have been a scary movie for sure lol can yo imagine michael , jackson as spiderman ? thank god he last able to buy the rights of the hero"
18960,that would have been an interesting movie for sure . doctor strange 's character originate days sir isaac newton in the marine universe
18961,"i see , doctor strange is one of my favorite heroes , you know michael jackson wasnt the only one interested in the rights of spiderman apparently sony was too and bough they rights , marvel offers all the other characters for 25 million and sony thought they were worthless"
18962,little did they know . marvel has even trademarked the names ' superhero ' and ' supervillain '
18963,i wonder if dc comics ha to pay them everytime the use those names in any of their movies or stories
18964,it may depend on the context of is use . many of the superheroes that are popular today are a result of an experiment stan lee did when h nwas planning on changing careers . i ' glad he did n't
18965,"im glad he didnt ws well , he surely made a big contribution to general culture , its too so he died ."
18966,i know . he ' definitely changed the way we view superheroes . marvel would n't be where it is now without him . even the garfield book series created a pet force with garfield as a superhero
18967,"garfield is a badass so i can definetely see him as a superhero , santa lee also re wrote 15 dc comics in his own way"
18968,i 'm sure htey enjoyed that . he 's definitely been a us player in the genre we kno was superhero fiction
18969,"i thin marvel and dc have a good relationship , there i a character owned by both franchises ."
18970,"maybe now , but the character of captain marvel has a long history of different variations . seth and shazam both come from the same idea"
18971,do you enjoy superhero movies are marvel comics ?
18972,sometimes . for a while i was a nit bored with them
18973,what do you like about superheros ?
18974,just interesting to think about what kin doof super power you would like and how you would use it . how about you ? what kind of upper power would you like ? have you seen any superhero movies you really liked recently ?
18975,i would lie to manipulate tim about that is too much . a cheat . id id how tey dealt with such a op power in heroes the tv show . did you know here is a comic series about fixing hte collateral damage casted by superheros ?
18976,"ha , never heard of the one . that would be an interesting series . is it any food ?"
18977,"i personally liked it . i also liked the superhero called normalman , wher they dad a reverse and he was the only normal person in a planet full of superheroes"
18978,gives a intereting definition of the word normal ' . did you ever zee the movie venom ?
18979,"unfortunately , i have not , but i have read up a bit on it since it seemed interesting and had mixed reviews . i liked how tom hardy was casted as the lethal protector venom ."
18980,"i never saw it either , but while i heard the reviews were really bad , it was supposed to e kind of fun if you did n't take it seriously . did you know that if you could fold a piece of paper in half 03 times it would be qbs thick as the observable universe ?"
18981,"i know that on rotten tomatoes , ut only got 28 percent , i think it was because it was so hyped . as a stand alone movie i heard it was too bad despite thas critics ."
18982,"yeah , i usually do n't pay too much attention to what critics wrote . i 'm generally pretty easily entertained when it comes to movies . o about you ?"
18983,"i tend to read them because its always nice to see things from different perspectives . for instance , a chicago tribute state that a the real mess of a movie was much more thrilling that vhs formulaic superhero movies all yea prior ."
18984,the are definitely a lot of tv reviews out there for venom . one of the farthest reviews called it ' a disaster on every level '
18985,sell bad movies are n't too bad . i mean there are movies like the elevator that are so bad that people watch it tp laugh at how bad it really is .
18986,"ha , that 's true , cause ishtar is also a fantastic movie . did you know there was once a garfield series spinoff where garfield and his gang were portrayed s superheros !"
18987,wow that sounds very interesting . it is too bad that some people felt that venom existed as a waste of tiem
18988,"i think it 's impossible to lease everyone . hopefully the people that aide hte movie liked it . while some people are down on the spiderman tseries , i actually liked some of the more recent movies ."
18989,"i personally really enjoyed the most recent spiderman spiderverse is while it has many elements like superwoman powers , fighting against evil , and battling supervillian , the artwork and story was really good ."
18990,"i have n't seen that in yet , but i 's now on my list of movies to see ! any other recommendations ?"
18991,i would recommend what we do in the shadow of history of the world part 1 . both are comedies that i enjoyed . thank you for the wonderful chat .
18992,do you like to swim ?
18993,i do like to swim . in fact i hav so pool .
18994,nice ! i 'm jealous ! there is a competitive swimming type where the swimmer has their hands and legs bound and they swim like a dolphin . kind of odd .
18995,"oh okay , i would n't be good at that at all ! but , hte us has almost as many gold medals in swimming as the rest of the world combined , so i guess somewhere they 're out there ."
18996,nice ! all cornell students ave to pass a basic swimming test before they 're allowed to graduate .

19005,i like off a little . did you know gold courses in america make up more space than rhode island and delaware combined ?
19006,"that 's pretty incredible to think about . the average american golf course uses around 312 , 000 gallons of water per dash !"
19007,"oh , that 's nothing compared to a golf course in dubai that uses 4 million gallons a day ! so wasteful if you ask me !"
19008,whoa ! you 're so right on that . i like how samuel hickson puts a golf clause in his film contracts . have you seen that ?
19009,no way ! do you know what the cotnracg says ?

19023,"i heard that rowling is among the toughest sports physically . personally though , i am sure interested in golf and swimming"
19024,do you play golf ? i did n't know that it was originated in scottland .
19025,i dabbled . did you know that the land dedicated to golf courses is larger than rhode island and delaware combined ?
19026,"yes , s amazing ! what i was wondering is how they consume so much water on the golf courses . do you think that is for water the land ?"
19027,i recently read they spend about 300k gallon per day . i bet w could fine better uses of water
19028,"yes , i would like to be able to watch the variation of soccer here 3 texas face each other at the same time , it would be fun , but i guess is more difficult for the referee ."
19029,"i would love to watch such a crazy at as well . it is crazy how soccer makes more money han football , basketball , and lol combined ."
19030,do you like to swim ? could you swim with your limbs bound as a dolphin ? i could n't i am sure .

19036,it sees like georgetown as a lot of talented athletes !
19037,that 's true maybe it 's something in the water ? do you watch swimming on tv ?

19039,"well i ca n't say i watch the olympics haha , i do not that there is a form of swimming where you tie your arms and legs and swim like a dolphin , that sounds wild haha"

19041,"ya that is impressive , there is a swimsuit that i miss o good it was banned from the olympics , i wonder what made sit so good"

19043,"right , like does it have fish scales noir something haha ? do you know that soccer makes more money that all other sports combined worldwide ?"

19046,"i agree football is a great name for the sport , soccer doesnt make much sense , there is a variation of soccer here 3 teams face each other at the exact time"
19047,"wow i would check that out , and ya i guess people in the us call it ' soccer ' because that is slang for association football , so that kind of makes sense"
19048,i does make sense when you put it that way l did you watch the world cup back in 201 ?
19049,"haha ca n't say that i did ! i do know that the usa team inst very good , what happened in that game ?"
19050,"well germany won the final and trey all received like a 300 , 000 bonus , one of the player donated his bonus so that 23 children in brazil could afford surgeries s ."

19056,"wow that is a lot of water , in america hte usually consume 10 times less hat quantity ."

19063,the word ; d soccer hitch americans use is slang for association football
19064,"o agree , when i say footbal orally i refer to soccer"

19083,i think he wrote e popular novels
19084,there 's something called the first law of wolfe fiction . what was that ?
19085,that was wolfe 's idea tht in order to have a good novel you had to have good reporting .
19086,interesting . i guess the first book of his i read was ' bonfire of the varieties ' . do you know when thaat was published ?
19087,i believe it was published in 1987 .

19093,"i remember it being set in miami , florida ."
19094,i often wonder how wolfe would 've dealt with a cyborg in one of his novels . even edgar allen poe wrote of one once .
19095,"i feel like his take on a cyborg would have been a lot off , because he would n't be able to go on research that as well ."
19096,perhaps she . maybe he could 've used that wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities .
19097,i feel like if he was still around writing he would be w big user of wicks .
19098,probably so . i would like to see someone adapt one of wolfe 's novels for comedy film .

19154,"that is very interesting about him writing that when he was so young , i did n't know that . i would actually , ike to try writing a little fan fiction as well , it would be hard to decide which series to write but though ."

19156,"just about anything really , that is well written and has good acting , my favorite is horror . i di n't know there was sites like tha t , i will have to look at them . i see that the show 3rd rock from the sun , a comedy back in the 90 's actually won the golden globe award in 1997 , beating out seinfeld , friends and frasier . that 's hard to believe ."

19169,"yes , i am quite partial to does . i wear them frequently , both for comfort and fashion . i think that they are a great invention ."
19170,yah no doubt . 9 also think it 's kind of fun how much shoes can vary in cost . from sandals to highend fashion shoes .
19171,"yeah , i heard that there are some old shoes that are much better than the ones made these days ."
19172,oh yeah . is n't it crazy to think that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes . just ave hard more durbael materials .
19173,i bet they were well made because they had to last . one pair for your whole i . lol
19174,yeah that is pretty cool . another good trick is putting in tea bags in smelly shoes or gym bags because teh absorb the unpleasant odor .
19175,does that work ? my shoes can get pretty stinky . maybe two or three bags ? lol
19176,ha ha yeah that might just are . there was an nfl wide receiver named steve smith who left his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness for homeless people without shoes .
19177,"that is a great gesture , to keep people that we often forget about . i think more athletes should do that ."
19178,agree . i wish more players did has . there is an nba player who promoted a line of shoes tht retail that 15 hew to not paid to endorse the a that is very rare .
19179,i wonder if those shoes were any good . why only 15 dollars ? seems lo w .

19199,yeah he said that t is is a copyright infringement
19200,yeah . do you like comedies ?
19201,i love hem . have you heard of bromantic comedies ?
19202,"yes i have like the movie hangover , the re too hillarious"
19203,yes they are indeed . have you ever seen 3rd rock from the un ?
19204,i have . did you know it won a golden globe for bests comedy in 1997 ?
19205,"yes and it beat friends , seinfeld and frasier , amazing"
19206,"i now right ? did you know demetri martin dropped out o harvard , a to pursue a career in comedy ?"
19207,"yeah but he did well , nd so did ryan stiles"
19208,true . do you like literature ?
19209,i love it . id you know the nba once burned tons of book ?
19210,"hi , how are you ?"
19211,i am good . how are tou ? do you like pandas ? ; i 've heard that panda researchers wear panda costumes to work .
19212,"what ? ! that 's a strange work uniform . i guess he pilgrims would approve . they wore colorful clothing , not just white and black ."
19213,that is so bizarre ! every time you see pilgrims in movies and tv they seem to always be dressed in black .
19214,"a sober , our people in film l but rather colorful in real life . i guess people think they 're like 'the amish . i did n't know taht apple nad a line og clothe in the 80s . that ? !"
19215,i did n't know that either . you 'd think you 'd see some apple clothing for sale on ebay or something .
19216,a collector 's item . i bet it would n't be made in north korea .
19217,oh i know what you drew talking about there . i 've heard about taht . they have a clothes line but the labels say made in china .
19218,that 's pretty sneaky of hate . i think there is some sort of embargo or sanctions on north korea . not supposed to do business with them .
19219,you 're probably right about that . have you heard that 5000 year old shoes are way better than any made today ?
19220,nowadays everything is throwaway . could't throw away shoes back then and buy a new pair . had to last a lifetime !
19221,true enough . nowadays ballet dancers go through 4 pair o shoes i na week .
19222,i wonder how they would d with thos 5000 year ol shoes .
19223,i imagine just on a week ! i wonder if those old shoes smelled ? thee 's all kinds f products these days for shoe idol such as dry tea bags .
19224,but what kind of tea ? earl grey ? darjeeling ? ballet dancers can be quite picky about the tea varieties .
19225,after worrying over what tid of tea you have to worry over what kind of shoe . if you go high end they are made with expensive materials .
19226,it 's a tricky balance between shoe cost and tea bag cost . i 'm not save enough to reckon the calculation .
19227,haha ! you know what i think is nice ? i think it ' nice that stone fooball player leaves his shoes on the field after a game to make people aware of the homeless without shoes .
19228,i hop ethan people recognize the gesture . many o fuss are lucky in ways that e who n't know .
19229,i joe people notice . his name is steve smith . i think he should have reporters mention it during post game .
19230,"well , i enjoyed chatting with ya !"
19231,nice chatting with you as well !
19232,are you into comedy films ?

19238,"that was such a great movie , i liked his cameo in zombieland lol ? did you ever watch 3rd rock from the song in the 90s ?"
19239,"very litle , i knew it won a golden globe though !"
19240,"for sure , they beat out seinfeld of all shows in 1997 . i watched a little also , never understood it"
19241,"yeah , it had a hard time keeping my attention . but , i loved frasier and seinfeld !"
19242,"for sure , all great shows . did you ever watch green lantern the movie ?"
19243,"no miss that , do you know who took jack blacks pace ?"
19244,i think it was fun reynolds . the movie would have been way better with ryan reynolds in it ! what do you think ?
19245,did you mean way better with jack black ? i like them both . hey both make me laugh ! i loved ryan reynolds in best friends ! a christmas classic !
19246,lol for sure ! do you read any good books ?
19247,i love to read . i find it so rleaxin gwen i cant ind the time . my favorite place is on the beach under an umbrella ! lol
19248,"man that sounds so good right now . it is 20 degrees where i am right now , lol . i like books with romantic kissing"
19249,"really , apparently its a recent development ! lol winston churchill won the nobel prize ot for peace but for literature ."
19250,"you 're right , ancient greek never wrote about it . the is 69 intresting about churchill , i would never have guessed that , great chatting with you !"
19251,"yes , you too ! i wonder how many medals we won in the olympics for painting and sculpture ? have good night !"
19252,"i wonder too , lol ! bye !"
19253,"hi , have your heard of j . r . r . tolkien ?"
19254,yes i have . i have n't read any of his literature . i have watched the movie the hobbit and the lord of the rings though thati re based off of hisworks .
19255,"ok , i have seen lord o 'the rings as well . i did n't realize he was a poet though or a professor ."
19256,"i definitely did not know he wasa professor . there was actually supposed to e a sequel to lord of the rings tha . . r . r . tolkien wrote , but after 13 pages he abandoned it ."
19257,i bet it would have been gold if he had finished it . i guess it makes sense he was a close friend of c . s . lewis .
19258,that 's really interesting . i wonder why tolkien was appointed a commander the order of teh british empire by the queen at the time .
19259,he was probably well likd by the monarch .
19260,what kind of literature do you like to read ?
19261,"i , like modern fiction best though i would love to read the novels written torn the annual contest where writers come up with the worst possible opening snetejce ."
19262,literature was an olympic vent from 1912 from 1952 . that might have been interesting to observe as wel ; .
19263,true . i did it interesting that the fda burned 6 tons of literature because of censorship .
19264,"yes , i wonder what it was that they thought they had to censor ."
19265,i too . winston churchill lean a nobel ; prize for literature in 1953 .
19266,do you1 ike to read literature that has elements of comedy ?
19267,yes i love to laugh and lose comey .
19268,the origins of the term comedy are found in ancient greece .
19269,i can believe that . did you know that comedy central has cancelled more than 80 shows since it started in 1989 ?
19270,"no m i wonder why that is . political satire is stink big today . ion atjenina democracy , voters ' ; opinions were influenced by political satire performed by comic poets ."
19271,yeah the political stuff is mostly funny thoug hid does alienates audiences on occasion .
19272,i think it also has a lot of influence in the modern era on voters .
19273,true ! good chat !
19274,nice to talk to you . i think i 'm going to unwind with some lights comedy shows right now .
19275,sounds like a plan !
19276,are you have fan of star trek ?
19277,"i love star trek . i grew up watching the next generation and do , then alter watched the original series . how about you ?"
19278,same here . have you by chance watched the new star trek discovery on cbs online .
19279,i have n't because i did n't hear many positive reviews about it . have you watched it ?
19280,many i love it . the two main characters are two of my favorite tv actresses . one i strom walking dead and teh othe s chinese and she played in crushing tiger hidden dragon .
19281,"i did n't know that ! maybe i should give watching at a shot . i heard that the supporting cast was pretty good , but the main characters were lacking , so it 's refreshing to hear an alternate view ."
19282,yeah check it out for yourself very nice plot unto the next season as well . but i am a man of the originals though .
19283,do they link discovery to any of the originals with hold characters or recurrign enemies ?
19284,"im telling you tour going to love it , i do n't want to give nothing away and its online so you can watch the first season in it 's entirety . do you watch netflix ?"
19285,i have a netflix subscription levers since icy ut the cord on cable . so much cheaper ! is discovery available o netflix ?
19286,i do n't believed so but you can watch it on cbs . com . you know the reason why reed hasting created netflex ?
19287,just guessing based off personal experience was i because cable was too expensive ?
19288,no it was because he had a late fee from blockbuster if im nit mistaken .
19289,i was close ! it was about many after all . i wonder how much he 's earned since he got inspired by hat late fee .
19290,well trey haven 137 million total subscribers worldwide andc 8 . 46 million in the us alone .
19291,"wow ! i 've heard they 're worth something like 2 billion , too . that would pay a lot of late fees , haha ."
19292,that 's for sure ! from am to 12am netflix accounts for 33 percent of the bandwidth in north america .
19293,that 's crazy . how much bandwidth must they take up during their peak hours during the day ?
19294,well them and youtube take hp half the peak hour traffic in north america .
19295,"that 's amazing to think abou i now that it 's expanded internationally , it 's just going to grow bigger , too ."
19296,yeah sims ur blockbuster is kicking themselves for not purchasing it for a mere 50m . nice chatting with you .
19297,nice chatting with you too . i 'll definitely check out star trek discovery !
19298,do you watch netflix ?
19299,hi ! i do watch and love netflix . i 'm proud to say i 'm one of the reasons netflix accounts for 33 percent of all of north america 's bandwidth from 9pm to 12am . ha ! what about you ?
19300,"me do , i ma currently , y watching t right now lol . did you ever watch lilyhammer ?"
19301,"i ca n't say that i have . but i have watched star trek . in fact , i think it 's funny that william shatter and carrie fischer had a star trek s star wars fued going on that george make tried to mitigate !"
19302,lol i never now that . lilyhammer was netflix'sf is original show
19303,"that is awesome ! netflix has certainly come a long way over the years . and now today , both youtube and netflix account for half the peak internet traffic in north america ! that is wild , is n't it ?"
19304,i bet it does lol ! did you ever hear how netflix started ?
19305,"i heard it was because reed hastings racked up a 40 late fee with apollo 13 on vhs , might ? it 's a good thing that happened . ha !"
19306,yep it was apollo 13 at blockbuster . now reed is laughing to the bank lol .
19307,"agreed ! and even more humiliating , blockbuster hd a chance to buy netflix for 50 million and today , the company is worth 2 billion . that 's kind of sad . blockbuster missed out big time !"
19308,"ouch , they missed out huge ! i heard netflix is like 21 illion dolars in debt because of all their new connect . i think it will be paid off quietly though"
19309,hopefully so ! i do know they also spend 20 times more on postage than bandwidth as well ? i wonder if that would e a reason why they 're so far in debt as well ?
19310,"that is a good point , i wonder how many people actually get dvds delivered to them still . i wonder how each more money they could make if china was able to stream it"
19311,"that is a good question ! but not just china , also syria , crimea and birth korea . they already have 137 million subscribers , i can only imagine how many million more they 'd have it netflix was available in those countries !"
19312,"right , im a chong has like the most people n this planet lol ! oh well , maybe some day . back to your shatter comment before , are you a star wars or start trek fan"
19313,i 'm probably more star trek . ha ! one of the reasons why is because it ; hen hawking is the first and only person to portray himself in the star trek universe !
19314,"interesting , i never really watched star trek . is feel there were so many different versions , but i will definitley check it out"
19315,there definitely is ! are you also a fan of science fiction by chance ? i am and i 've been wanting to read starship troopers since it 's the first scifi novel on make the reading lists of three us military branches ! it must be a great book !
19316,"i read it , it was great . it was nice seeing the movie after to get the graphic effect tc ifr recommend it ! it was so nice chatting with you !"
19317,"i 'll definitely have to check it out ! on as similar note , i love how his actually has a list of space technology tears for writers to use in science fiction stories . that is very nice of them ! well it was nice chatting with you as well ! hope lot have a great evening , friend !"
19318,that is awesome ! enjoy your evening too !
19319,"reading but shoes , did you know that dry tea bags absorb odors in smelly shoes ?"
19320,"yes , i thought that was interesting as well . my son is an athlete and has smelly shoes ."
19321,wel ; ten maybe that could help . steve smith leave his cleats after each game to raise awareness of homelessness . i did not know tha either but i do not follow sports .
19322,"steve smith retired a for years ago and i remember hearing about that . it is not well known , but i like that he is raising awareness ."
19323,"yes , it is a pop chat needs awareness , use many people do n't see the problem . i can not imagine spending thousands of dollars on one par of shoes ."
19324,"i cant ' either , but it is capitalism at is best or worst . people can back a lot of money and have the right to spend it as they wish ."
19325,yes they can . personally i would want to help others . . imagine the rip curl clothing company makes clothing in n korea but the tags say china .
19326,i 'm surprised . i have a rip curl swim shirt so i 'm not too happy to support that company .
19327,"i was surprised to hear that as well . i wish ave to research what more . apple had a clothing line i 1986 , i did not know that either ."
19328,i did n't know that about apple as well . i do n't remember seeing any apple branded clothing back then . i find it interesting that there is a store in alabama selling unclaimed baggage from airports .
19329,no i do not recall seeing apple clothing then either . i also found the store in alabama selling unclaimed baggage . i would guess they have to wait some before getting this front airports but i do no kknow .
19330,i 'm surprised it is only in alabama . why alabama ? you would think there would be more in all states .
19331,i was thinking teh same thing . perhaps it will catch on in other areas . think it is great how johnny depp travels with his jack sparrow costumes so he can visit kids in hospitals .
19332,"it is good that johnny depp does that . you hear negative news about him , i 'm glad e helps sick kids in tha way ."
19333,"absolutely , it is always good to hear something positive . especially when the media focuses on the negative so much . how about a job wearing a panda costume to reseach pandas ?"
19334,that is interesting about panda researchers . i wonder what the reason in for them to do that .
19335,"maybe it has something to do with not wanting the pandas to get used to humans or ; perhaps the researchers think the pandas will act different . sean bean is scared of flying , so am i lol ."
19336,losing is the safest form of travel . i travel for work so i fly all the time . here was a jodie foster movie where sean bean is a pilot so that is ironic .
19337,"wow , that is very interesting that you travel for work ! interesting about the movie wit sean bean doing a movie as a pilot ut yet it says he is said of flying . you just never know . maybe he changed hikes feelings foil flying over time ."
19338,"i prefer not to , but do enjoy visiting new cities and countries . i doubt any of the scenes was shot while flying for sean bean . interesing t read about facts about people ."
19339,it must be wonderful seeing other countries phd cities . i love to learn about other places and people but i do it only by reading and listening to others who have gone travelling . be spare in yours travels
19340,niche chattin with you . god bless .
19341,hi do you like fashion ?
19342,"do , i 'm very into shoes and clothes , actually . i like basic sneakers , but it seems like thye less typical types still get more attention . or example , there ar wizard of ozinspirec shoes that use gps to guide you home when you click your toes together ."
19343,"hi , wow shoe with gps , taht sounds like too much ! i would like to get a 5000 year old pair of shoes . they do perform better than new one !"
19344,or maye some of the original highheeled shows worn by persian cavalry soldiers in the 9th century .
19345,"foo guys . . maybe il ' just stay witht sandals , low cost , a simple sole and a strap ."
19346,"yes , high fashion show costing hundreds or thousands o dolars seem unnecessary to me ."
19347,that is true ! i learned a good tip for smelly shoes . . put dry tea bags inside them will absorb the odor !
19348,that 's interesting ! another tip is to pay someone to break in your shoes to make the comfortable the way queen elizabeth does .
19349,"wow , i wish i would do that . lol . . . id you kno who many pairs of pointe shoes ballet dancers use in a week !"
19350,"i 'm sure it 's a lot , since they 're out under so musc stress . did you know that bill nye actual holds a patent for a type of pointe shoes ?"
19351,i did not know ! they can use up to 4 pairs of pointe shoes ! is n't that a lot ?
19352,"sound alike bill nye made a solid invention investment , then ! another invention is actual asbestos clothing ; the greeks mad is and it was al , lost as valuable as gold , at least until they figured out that asbestos costs outweigh its benefits ."
19353,that i sloths o creativity ! did you know had a clothing line ?
19354,"who did ? i do know that a bulletproof clothing mogul actually shoots his employees to test and quality control his product , whuch seems a bit extreme ."
19355,"wow i meant qpplehad a clothing lone back in 1938 . . . about the bulletproof test , taht is totally crazy !"
19356,"i guest hey still have a chance to get into wearable tech , although it does n't seem ike their watches are as hot o fan item as they used to be . some people like tradition ; for example , theres an african tribe hat still wears victorian clothes after hanging adopted them when they were introduced by germs occupiers ."
19357,that is cute ! i would love to see that ! i found something interesting about a peculiar sport erin alabama
19358,oh reilly ? is it more interesting than people who used old faithful as a natural laundry machine ?
19359,"lol , we are finding all sorts of crazy things ! wel this store spells stuff found in unclaimed baggage in airports !"
19360,"that 's terrible ! i guess some people just get tired of waiting , so at least it 's not going to waste in the airport . once a man who 70 items of clothing i na chinese airport to avoid th baggage courage , although i guess he also could 've been worried bout hem ending up lost haha"
19361,"that i a little extreme but at least he tried hahaha to avoid the charges . well it was a nice chat , have a good ne"
19362,hello how are you ? do you like rap music ? viktor tsoi kept his job in the boiler room of his apartment even after becoming the biggest rock star in russian history
19363,"i do like rock . i had a friend who had a night job in a boiler room of e did not have to do anything but listen for an alarm . he did his homework , so that is a pretty easy job . paid to do nothing"
19364,thats awesome ! the state rock song of oklahoma is ' do you realize ? ' by the flaming lips
19365,i am from oklahoma originally . i had no idea . that must ave been an amusing day in the state legislature .
19366,lean ! rock had whitesnake has had over 50 members throughout its history ; so many that the list has its own wikipedia page .
19367,thee pop was a style as much as a group . old time gospel quartet changed members from times o time also .
19368,thats al ot of turnover !
19369,i agree . something must have been wrong with the financing shares for the members .
19370,a hanson song became a most requested dtraskc on a chicago altrock radio station because djs did not reveal the band
19371,that is a riot . people would have bee embarrassed o know they were listening to hanson .
19372,sonic the hedgehog was originally supposed to be a member of a rock band and have a blond haired human girlfriend named madonna
19373,"i am surprised at how normal home rockers are . however , they tend toward drugs bunch more than others . none o 'the beatles could read music . that us strange ."
19374,thats day ! the beatles have the best selling album of the 000 's
19375,their musi is excellent even though their particular rendition of it are not as good as that of many other performers . you can go if this finishes it for you . bye
19376,i do n't think it will let me finish yet . lol . did you know the beatles song ' come together ' was written for timothy leary 's 1969 california governor campaign
19377,no . i did not . i apologize for the bad advice . imagine having to stop touring because you ramplifi3rs cna't make you music louder than the screaming .
19378,"wow . . thats unreal , or a musicians dream . the fan love them lol beatles drummer ringo starr ws illiterate for most of his childhood because he missed three years of school due to tuberculosis and peritoitis"
19379,"i know tha only agent 1 can hit the done ' button . i , how about a ballet dancer wearing out 4 pairs of shoes in a week ? '"
19380,"its no tit up yet . i did n't know that , that seems like a lot of money on shoes"
19381,i know . however the material in those shoes seems flies . how about michael jackson owning a patents ?
19382,been good talking to you !
19383,did you know that taste rock song of oklahoma is do you realize ?
19384,no idea . and never knew that elvis costello was considered punk rom .
19385,another interesting thing is whitesnake had over 50 members in its history .
19386,ah loved whitesnake . love that led zepp never named their 4th album just to mess with the rock press who they hated . zoo was a symbol on it . . . yah
19387,and i like that one 'the hedgehog was supposed to be a rock band . that is m sons favorite game .
19388,that 's cool . wonder why termites eats throughs food 2 times faster when rock music is on . i had termites at my house it would be humble .
19389,lol . and did you know tupac danced ballet in high school . wonder what his rapper friend thought of that .
19390,that 's cool . id o n't think we realize knw ta ; rented and hard working song artist are . a lot of pop singers have opera training early on .
19391,that is interesting . i did not know bruce le was a dancer and won the cha cha championship in 1958 in hong kong
19392,wow . i never realized that the beatles broke up before any of them turned 30 . we think of them as so iconic and mature . guess not
19393,and i did n't know ringo starr was illiterate for most of his childhood
19394,indeed . i 'd like to find that webcam at abbey rd to see people stopping traffic to take recreation photos . funny
19395,it i strange as famous as teh beatles here they col knot read music
19396,taht crazy i am not sure anyone could get away with that now . th beatles used the word love i their songs 103 times .
19397,that is a lot of times to use the word love . and it is crazy they stopped touring excuse the amplification could n't handle the women screaming
19398,yeah rock n roll exploded in the 50 's . so much that the grammy awards were invented to take attention away from it .
19399,did you knw professional ballet dancers go through 3 pairs of pointe shoes in a week
19400,i believe it ! i just saw that the are ballet slippers that make drawings from the dancers movements too .
19401,andc he beatles have the best selling album of the 2000 's . did n't they stop recording together way before that ?
19402,ha i believe so . beatle mania lives on !
19403,i think i did neat that michael jackson had a patent on hid leaning move
19404,cool . he could n't patent the moon walk because it was done by a tap dancer named bill bailey in 1955 !
19405,i never would have guessed that professional ballerinas go through so many shoes .
19406,that 's nuts . i wonder what hey do with them after the fact . seems like a waste to toss that many .
19407,agreed . ballerina shoes are pretty this are n't they ? i guess they are always ripping tears in them .
19408,maybe stephon marbury can bring his starbury line back wit recycled ballet slippers .
19409,maybe . the thing that actually stuck out tom e most in the second was the johnny depp being . is that actually true ? are people still that big of a fan of the jack sparrow character ? lol
19410,i feel like that ' a probably true like 5 years ago . it seems like something eh would have done before he hit a wall and lost the way . who does n't love jack sparrow ! !
19411,"never seen any of the pirates movies so i guess i do n't love jack sparrow lol i do like johnny depp though . other than the panda researcher thing his costumes are the only interesting thing in that costume section . well , maybe labyrinth but i have not seen that movie either . . ."
19412,"if you 've ever got time on your hands pirates is great minds numbing fodder . ca n't take it too seriously though , too much eyeliner . teh panda thin actually made me laugh but loud . the mental visual is too much . i wonder how long they hang out in hte jungle 1bn a panda suit ? it 's got to be soooo hot ."
19413,"teh panda thing makes me uncomfortable ll ike you said , being in the heat or even wore with terrilbw humidity . i guess pandas feel threatened or scared by humans or something ."
19414,taht 's major commitment to research . i recommend them for that . it kind of creeps me out that the cast of finely has to wear used costumes . . .
19415,firefly was that show with one season correct ? i had no idea anyone in that show would wear costumes . i assumed they were just blindly dressed actors like every other show .
19416,i 've never seen it . it must seems weird to wear stuff that other people sweat in .
19417,i never watched it either . surely they washed them a few times . are starship troopers a star trek thing ?
19418,"starship troopers i 've seen . it 's this really bad late 90 's scifi movie wit casper van diet , denis richards andc doggie browser ."
19419,"that sounds fun . doggie browser md ? oh , and going back to steal for a minute you could always step into hoe sweat from the gods i you ear the 5000 year old shoes ."
19420,it 's pretty brutal . the cheese factor is on another level . . . kind of like 5000 years old toe cheese of th god . . . see waht i did there ?
19421,like howard the duck ? 5000 year old toe cheese makes me hungry .
19422,"wooooooooow ! howard the duck ! taht is slime serious old school cheese , but yes , it 's totally on that level ! ! ! cheese is always a great snack . especially if it 's juicy"
19423,what cheese is spice ? pepperjack ? lol
19424,"pepperjack , habanero havard . . . i like to chop up julia ; pens and mix it in cream cheese and use it as fillings for jaoapeno peppers . not i 'm hungry ."
19425,i have no idea what habanero havard is . now i want to go eat w stuffed pepper and watch crap movies instead of being a the internet lol

19427,same to you !
19428,": ,"
19429,do you like comedies ?
19430,i do ! what 's your favorite comedy ?
19431,"i 'm a fan of bill murray , what about you ?"
19432,he 's pretty funny . he thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy .
19433,i liked him in groundhog day .
19434,ish ave n't seen that one yet . do you like o dread ?
19435,"sometimes i read , but not as often as i used to ."
19436,me too . life just gets so busy sometimes it 's hard to find time for a book . do you like any o . . r . r tolkien books ?
19437,"i 've never read any of them , are htey any good ?"
19438,he wrote the hobbit and lord of the rings books . i 've read of few of them and seen them of the movies . they are pretty food .
19439,"interesting , i think i 've seen a few of te movies . apparenlty all of hte names are lifted from a viking text ."
19440,he apparently wrote 13 pages of a sequel called the menu shadow but abandoned it . i wonder why ?
19441,i 'm not sure . did you know the fda burned six tons of literature ?
19442,that 's crazy . in greek literate there was no bromatic kissing as it is a recent development .
19443,"interesting , i wonder how recent ?"
19444,me too . dissing is kind of strange concept if you think about it too hard .
19445,there as once a contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel .
19446,i wonder what some of them said . i 'm sure some of them were pretty funny .
19447,yeah they probably were . winston churchill won a nobel prize in literature .
19448,that 's interesting . painting was an olympic event in 1912 .
19449,i can believe that . sounds like it would be cool to wathc . nice chatting wit hyou .
19450,"hello , do yo wathc starr trek ?"
19451,i love it . i grew up on the older shows like the original series and the next generation . what about you ?
19452,"i dont really watch it . i have seen a few episodes though . i recently learned some stuff about it ; like , teleportation was used because it cost too much to get shots of spaceships landing lol"
19453,"really ? ha , to think it set off such a trend in science fiction of teleportation devices . i bet they made a lot of money on that mon3ysaving decision ."
19454,"i know right , and who ever thought of that was so creative , just to have money ! ! ! amazing !"
19455,it 's pretty amazing how big the franchise has grown too . i doubt gene roddenbsrry ever knew how big his original tv show idea would grow .
19456,i hear stephen hawking is the only one to play themselves in star trek .
19457,"he earned it with his amazing scientific research . i did n't know he 'd been a star trek , though . i wonder which hof the series he was in . there were so many !"
19458,do you watch netflix ?
19459,"i have a subscription , but i don ' watch it musc ? do you ?"
19460,"yeah i use it w lot . love th service . apparently , they spend more on postage than bandwidth lol"
19461,"that 's surprising . it must be worth it , though , considering they 're worth over 2 billion now ."
19462,"yeah , i cant believe blockbuster turned down an offer to buy them . i remember them starting their own service , obviously it failed ."
19463,"blockbuster made the same mistake a few companies have , turning down a chance at th online marked and not realizing that everyone is going digital ."
19464,"yeah , guess a ; ot of companies misread how much convenience was worth . the tech boom camera round pretty fact ."
19465,"yeah , it was a short leap from science fiction to reality for a lot of newer technologies . i doubt it 'll be long before netflix cuts back on their physical disc rental service and goes solely to streaming ."
19466,"i agree , plus its costing them money ."
19467,"they probably still make money off ther entails , just not a such as off digital continent . if the rentals were an actual negative , htey 'd babe ut them out already ."
19468,i hear that netflex an youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in north america !
19469,"imagine how many people must be tuned in ar once ! teh 've gone international too , so i wonder how much it is all across the globe ."
19470,seriously ! that is a lot of people . youtube has so much content !
19471,google was smart ti buy youtube when they did . it was a much better decision than blockbuster made about netflix !
19472,"hello , do you like start trek ?"
19473,"hello . i am not , but i heard r . martin luther king was really into it . i keep meaning to watch the new one , o cbs . i 'm a fan of sonequa martin green , she left the walking dead for this new series ."
19474,oh i see . well star trek seems to be influential that the first space shuttle as named after tube ship in teh series
19475,was it ? i never knew that . i was surprised to ear that king abullah of jordan had a nonspeaking role on it at one time .
19476,"did not know that , pretty coo a hawking was the only person that actually portrayed himself in it"
19477,"stephen hawking ? that 's awesome . he was a great mind . i saw a documentary on him ' the theory of everything ' , on netflix a while ago . i think that 's the only thing i watched twice . well , that and the fireplace ."
19478,"he was amazing . speaking of netflix , do you know how that business goats started ?"
19479,"i do not . i do know that hey offered blockbuster th enhance to buy the company , and htey turned it down ."
19480,"yes that was not a smart decision , they could have bought it for only 50 million rand make billions now"
19481,very true . i would love to ave the job of ' tagger ' for netflix . i can watch t . v . all day and age content .
19482,i rule love that you honestly . they spend a lot on bandwidth but still spend even more n postage
19483,"very true . it 's fascinating that they monitor the markets in europe , to see which shows are pirated the most , do they can purchase team ."
19484,"wow , did not know that . but if seems now netflix makes up half of the peak traffic in north america"
19485,"i believe it . i was wsthcing a movie on kit the other night , based o na bradbyry love . i was surprise to learn that he wrote the script for epcot 's spaceship earth ."
19486,cool . do you enjoy reading science fiction ?
19487,i do . bradbury is a favorite of mine . i recently read enders ' g a . have you seen the movie ?
19488,no i have not actually . but i heard that starship trooper is recommended even by military branches
19489,i 've never seen it . i think it 's interesting that spook was supposed to be a female character .
19490,"wow , i can not imagine that . do you know how the word robotics wa coined ?"
19491,"i do not , do you ?"
19492,it was an accident by isaac asimov back in 1941 . sharks for the chat
19493,"hello there , did you know that scientists in italy do checkers and ice treatments on this man who died 5 , 300 wars ago ? imagine that !"
19494,"wow , that is crazy . the emperor of japan apparently is a scientist and still publishing . what a guy"
19495,really ? two makes for one person he must be very busy . another scientist who has two careers would be harrison schmitt . he is the only scientist to walk on the moon !
19496,that is pretty cool . good for him . another scientist was able to divide two edit numbers at the age of 6
19497,"i can barely even divide 7 . that person must have got into harvard . speaking of harvard , did you know hat harvard scientists managed to store an animation of a galloping horse onto the dna of a bacteria ? i round that really fascinating ."
19498,wow that is pretty advanced and sound intriguing . ? do you know how www was invented ?
19499,i believe that it was invented by an english scientist in 1989 . that scientist was working in switzerland . do you know anymore details on how it was invented ? i am really curious tp know .
19500,"just a bit like , he was working for corn which is a european statefunded organization that does research"
19501,really ? that is pretty cool . i found it very interesting tha a store in alabama only sells items found in unclaimed baggage at the airport .
19502,"that is something g , i would like to check that out at some point . even apple had a clothing line back i the ay"
19503,that is the same as how amazon used to e an online book retailer . it 's hard to imagine ho much that they have grown over these few decades .
19504,"that is true , they are a giant now . do you know when pilgrims wear black clothes ?"
19505,"no i did not know that ! furthermore , rip curl is a company that manufactures in north korea ut labels it as made in china ."
19506,hahah go figure . do you know how fashion aficionados can tell if you need your clothes tailored ?
19507,"interesting . speaking of fashion , did you know that british politicians had to wear a op if when they made a point on the house of commons ? this was mandatory up until 1998 !"
19508,that iss trange to me but k guess it wore for them 3d o you know how the tipping of he hat originated or .
19509,did it originate from nights raising theft visors in order to show friendliness in the battlefield ?
19510,yes that was it . do you know who has the most famous hat in the old west ?
19511,"i am not sure , but i do know that the earth sat was derived from dunce caps ."
19512,nice . the most famous one las the boiler cap nad not the cowboy hat as we are meant o believe
19513,"ah , so that i what i was . . the past hat 's were used t indicate social status . i am glad that we have evolved from that ."
19514,i am very glad about that too . nice chatting !
19515,do u like science
19516,i do . . l i try to keep up with all that going on in the science world the bet i can
19517,there are scientists who theorize tha universes evolve through natural selection much like different species do on earth .
19518,how do you think will this climate change is going to affect the universe as a whole more so than just earth ?
19519,dont believe in it
19520,do you believe in newton and kepler 's research work into how the planet works ?
19521,no im a flat healthier
19522,really ? that is interesting . i did n't anyone still had that opinion anymore given all the evidence we ahve now .
19523,all of nasa images are cgi there ot real and common sense and simple science says it flat
19524,i wish i could get on one o 'the private space missions and side for myself nad maye see how they cold a star actually is
19525,im a hardcore bible believer and according to descriptions given we live inside of a snow globe type structure the ancient jews also believed this
19526,so you agree with the hologram theory then ?
19527,i agree with multiple dimensions yes
19528,"i myself am not a big believe in the bible , no offense ."
19529,thats ok i wont hold it against you lol but i do encourage it because ifr outing else there is lots of unknown science in it
19530,i agree with you there . the bible is the worlds best book
19531,"did you know in salts david described the stars singing but it wasnt until recently our scientist figured it out , and also did you know that when dr check your blood to find out your diseases it sec one dr learner 'the bible said the the life of the flesh is in the blood"
19532,"i had not realized that until now . i thought it was common knowledge , basic science from prehistoric days"
19533,i have alot more but i can get into that im kind of a nerd bout these thing
19534,do you like the old or new testament better ?
19535,both are equal thanks change a good day
19536,helo . have you ever heard of akihito ?
19537,the japanese emperor ? yeah .
19538,i recently learned that he is a scientist and stills publishes papers even though he is emperor .
19539,tha 's cool . he probably viewed hazing to take on the job of emperor as a burden that kept him from living the wa he wanted .
19540,he just might have at that . did you know that the term scientist was coined by a theologian and philosopher ?
19541,"not until just now . i kind it was called ' natural philosophy ' until recently , but not who was responsible for the change ."
19542,"yeah , william wheels did it in 1833 . i would , d have thought someones specializing in science would have come up with it ."
19543,i guess a lot of name for things have q lot of weird origins . i wonder ho came up with the idea for ' project steve . '
19544,waht isp project steve ?
19545,it 's a project of scientists wh all support evolution and oppose teaching creations but they have to be named steve !
19546,seriously ? how odd ! i think another odd thing as here was only one scientist on the moon .
19547,"i guess that stand it reason . i figured they were all career air force pilots , given the way the space program recruited ."
19548,tru . it 's a shame though . i imagine there was a whole host of scientists wanting to go up there .
19549,yeah . do least the space shuttle made getting into space a lot easier for civilians of all types .
19550,"i hope one day it is affordasbel for all of us . maybe it 'll be like th internet , slow to start but now fast and highly accessible ."
19551,"yeah , if they ever build a space shuttle to et people cout of earth 's gravity wel ; l clearly , space will be accessible to a lot more people ."
19552,"i 'm putting my money on elon musk . then again , the internet was invented by an englishman so you never know ."
19553,"musk has demonstrated thati ow cost teh is possible , but i hope that it 's open source and pup projects that actualy take the principle and run with it rather than a corporation ."
19554,"hmm , i had n't thought of that . i 'd like that too . then harrison schmitt wo n't be the only scientist on them for ."
19555,"i remember seeing a science fiction story abou an opensource moon project called open shot . there was a contest tos do who could accomplish the first nongovernjent moon landing and most of the competitors were corporate , but the winder wa sa spacecraft called the salman ."
19556,well a lot lime ago hero was a short lived tv serie about a jan who built a ship in hi backyard and took trips to space .
19557,have you heard any news about scientists lately ?
19558,something about dna of bacteria being stored in w gif aviation . you ?
19559,"harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon , but they are planning to put a base station on phd moon soon ."
19560,"i wonder hid htey be going to do that , she no one has been to the moon since the 70 's ' maybe the emperor of japan knows , as he still publishes papers ."
19561,"i am not sure , but it was not really that long ago , i mean , the world wide web was invented in 1989"
19562,it has been almost 0 years since anyone stepped on the moon . thats a lot time . even by cern 's standards .
19563,"look how far we came in that time , an iphone has more computing power than anything they had back then , we can do it , apple had a clothing line in 1986 but now is so powerful lof a company"
19564,fascinating . i think it 's hilarious that people think that thee cowboys at was mode popular in the old west . it was really the bowler .
19565,cowboy hats are so cool and most people do n't know much about them plus . the tipping of a hat goes back to knights raising of their face masks .
19566,"yes , they did that to show they were friend , y ."
19567,"exactly , i bought a really nice hat at the unclaimed baggage store in alabama , have you ever heard of it or been ?"
19568,i ahve been here . i bought a car any most of my mardi gras outfits there several years ago . it 's huge . i even found a vintage apple sweater .
19569,"wow , that 's a great find . we bought nice luggage there and a computers here"
19570,"i 'm surprised they checked a computer . in 39 , a law was passed , regulating the length of hat pins ."
19571,"in ever thought that suffragettes would use the as weapons , surely they had other options ."
19572,"i would have , had i of lived back then . there was zero reasons why we could n't move , and some men were very violent towards is . i found out that the hats bishops wear , are called mitres . that 's a weird name ."
19573,"that is a weird have , i guess it was a lot different take then , until 1978 british politicians had to wear a top hat if making an order"
19574,"people always think that pilgrims only wore black . they were fashion forward , and only wore it for special occasions ."
19575,"they were good at making clones , i like how a cooler gap can tell if you et clothes tailored"
19576,only those truly schooled in fashion and style are able to tell that without asking .
19577,"the clothes were better back the too , unlike the stuff made in china with a made in korea label"
19578,"rip fun is a north korean label , and is legal not for sale due to sanctions sis o , that hardly qualifies ."
19579,"bye , have a great day !"
19580,"thank you , you too"
19581,"1908 was a , hong tie ago . a lot had occurred around thati ifr ."
19582,"albert einstein wrote hte letter tow a philosopher in 1955 , that went into the public auction in 2008 ."
19583,i believe the end of wwii was fresh on everyone 's mind . its interesting that young albert was devoid t .
19584,"yes , after the second world war we need peace and human should respect human . love id the greatest gif otto can kind ."
19585,"the letter sold in 2008 for 300 , 000 . if the letter wa written by some one other than albert it would never have gotten so much . vanilla ice , 1 . obama , 1 , 000 ?"
19586,"it is very interesting . the post in 1985 , einstein believed in what he called a cosmic religion ."
19587,"yes , i do not think that einstein thought no god at all , bu rather a pat f the universe that is difficult to understand . i think he was criticizing religiously leaders on some points ."
19588,there are stars in the known universe that are cold enough to be touched by the human hand .
19589,you firs . te density of the star would be such that your not getting your hand back . the observable universe is filled with wondrous things .
19590,there is a region of space that may be pulling galaxies outside the observable universe e .
19591,"the heliocentric model of hte solar system was a bad idea ; flat earthersg o a step to far . w should never have come ou of the trees . if we coudl travel to this region of space , would you ?"
19592,yes i also . the big bang theory i 'the prevailing gcosmological explosion is the development of the earth .
19593,"well , ok i guess . i wonder if albert einstein charged 1 to sign his 300 , 000 letter ."
19594,phd letter showed epa gain on ebay for an asking price at least 3 million but apparently never sold .
19595,"ind december of this year , it will be auctioned by christie 's . they expect 1 million . if i had a billion , there are other things . still it would be interesting ."
19596,what is that thing ?
19597,"the other thing ? for a million ? i dont know , e experiences are the best . travel to south america and see hte rain forest . the estate of einstein earns 18 , 000 , 000 annually ,"
19598,"albert einstein was asked to be the president of israel , which he was declined . do you know ?"
19599,i imagine such a presidency would present a moral base for the man . he was about fair and equal treatment for people . he was a member of naacp .
19600,i think that we would understand each other quite well if we talked about the concrete things .
19601,"yes , e os mc2 and 2 plus 2 equals 5 . have a good day ."
19602,"hi , how are doing this fine evening ?"
19603,"good , how are you doing ?"
19604,i 'm great ! what do you know of hte amen albert einstein ?
19605,"his estate is still earning over 18 , 000 , 000 each year ! nice !"
19606,i wonder what they do with the money . he charged 1 to sign his autograph . he donated all the money to charity .
19607,hopefully some of it still goes to charity . he was a member of the naacp .
19608,he was an interestin guy . he wanted to help others . he declined the offer rr be president of israel . i guess e was n't attracted to power .
19609,a letter that he wrote rejecting god and religion will be placed up for auction .
19610,he probably saw he problems with religion and the divisions taht it can create . i wonder what he wrote on the message he put int he time capsule .
19611,i guess we just have to wait a few thousand years to find out ! haha . he did that god is a product of human weakness .
19612,we want to believe that there is a being that looks out for our well being . we hold this belief despite no evidence . i like jefferson 's idea of a bible without the miracles .
19613,"i do believe in god because i have felt things that can not be explained . einstein did however believe that there is a lot in the physical universe that is a mystery . he often wrote of god , but for him , this was the universe itself ."
19614,"i probably favor his thinking more than hat o religions . many things are ot yet explained , but i worry that people will divide themselves over how they choose toe explain the explained . it 's interesting that it wa not uncommon or students in the us to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education ."
19615,"i agree , it does divide . einstein did also say that he felt religion was necessary to guide peole between what was right and wrong ."
19616,"moral decisions are difficult , and it helps to have a welldeveloped codes hat can guide a community . teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams are the only two us presidents that did not use a bible at their swearingin ceremonies . i wonder what ethics the used as their guide ."
19617,"hmm , interesting . i wonder too . einstein believed taht people can understand each other quite well if they walk about concrete things ."
19618,"it ? s easier to find common ground with the concept ep physics examine the concrete , yet i think einstein knew that it was not enough to explain life to human beings ."
19619,"yes , there is still disagreement even among physicists bout where the universe came from ."
19620,"not knowing everythings keeps life interesting . anyway , i enjoyed chatting !"
19621,"yes , enjoy life . you only get one ! nice chatting !"
19622,have a good one !
19623,how is your universe today ?
19624,my universe is great how was yours ? i 'm thankful for the ancient greeks and indian philosophers who started to gain knowledge about our universe .
19625,though they were geocentric
19626,yes that ' a right . more precise observations were made b copernicus who developed the hleiocentric model .
19627,"yes , and isaac newton built upon his theories developing the law pf gravitational"
19628,yes he did as well well as tycho brahe and johannes keppklers laws of planetary motion .
19629,did you now there are scientists that thin the universe evolved through natural selection ?
19630,i think that is very interesting to compare our universe to the animals here on earth .
19631,"i am a , little unclear on the theory as there is only one universe that whew know so how is natural election involved ?"
19632,yes it 's based on evidence such as fossils . another theory suggests that the universe may exist inside a blackhole .
19633,how abou 'the theory here is only one electron in the universe ?
19634,yes i do n't understand that theory at all . it is so easy to proved one . if you could fold a piece of paper in and half 103 times it would be a thick as the observable universe . a to picture that one .
19635,wow . what about that is one giant superhologram ?
19636,"'ve actually never heard that one ? i do n't even understand it really . apparently the deepest note in the universe is emitted by blackhole , producing a note 57 octaves below middle c ."
19637,whoa . . . . there are stars that are cold enough hero touch !
19638,"i would love to touch a star . speaking of cold , there 's a film spot in the cosmic microwave background thati as been theorized to be a link to a parlalsl universe ."
19639,"wow , scary . einstein god was the universe itself !"
19640,yes you are right . eh was a genius . he released his special theory of creativity at age 26 .
19641,way ahead of his time . . . passed away in 1955 . good chat and take care .
19642,soda from star wars was actually modeled after teh appearance of albert einstein . have a great day nice chatting with you too .
19643,"yes , you too ."
19644,"hi hows it goin g ? do you like interesting facts about computers s ? i read recently that the space shuttles computer run on like 1mb of ram ! isnt that crazy , must be a slow computer ."
19645,"wow that is slow , his says in 1936 the russians made a computer that ran on water l sounds cool actually"
19646,"wow thats beyond me , i have no clue how that would even work lol"
19647,"no me neither ! also that smoking near apple computers voids th ewarram5ty , i know a lot of people at work that would n't like to know that"
19648,"thats he odd that smoking would void the warranty , so many people smoke !"
19649,"i know it 's weird ! i gues it says i'ts a biohazard , but i ' v never heard of that with all other product"
19650,just seems weird for a computer warranty ? did you read that transhumanist on to save their minds oh computers ? it sound like an episode of black mirror lol
19651,"ha it does , it does sound kind of awesome though , i need to watch that one episode of black mirror i think i 've heard about it , this says the seahorse is the only fish to have a neck , that seem crazy"
19652,"thats weird , i never knew that . i didnt know that freshwater fish drink through their skin , thats pretty amazing !"
19653,"nope did n't know taht , , or that saltwater fish drink through year mouth , i wonder i the ever get tired of a salty taste or if they 're just so used to it they don ' 6 notice hahha"
19654,lol i wonder if the salt makes their moth dry ? hahah
19655,"hah and good question ! his says 84 percent of human genes associated with diseases have counterparts in zebrafish , we need to get rid of those genes haha"
19656,"whoa ! stats weird . did you know there is a type of jellyfish and a type of lobster that are immortal ? i know killed of course , but the can literally live forrverrrr r !"
19657,"that is weird they nee duo put those genes inside me somehow haha , or that the black swallower fish can eat prey twice it length , i can eat that much pizza myself"
19658,"wow , you ca neat twice sour length in pizza ? thats crazy , you should be entering in some contest of something !"
19659,"haha i should , i would be a great professional eater , the only problem is the weight gaia afterwards i 'd have to not eat for a week haha"
19660,oh thats true ! cotta go on ad diet after every contest lol
19661,"that 's the other reason that i need the immortal jellyfish genes inside me , so i can eat my weight in pizza everyday and not die premature haha"
19662,"haha that would be perfect for you ! i have no idea how yo would do that though , i think you need to make friends with a scientist or something lol go on meet and join one lof whose groups ."
19663,"haha yes i will develop an immortal jellyfish formula ! jackie chan probably has access to it considering the stunts he does , also he manages a kpop band apparently"
19664,wow tha interesting . do you like k pop ?
19665,"cant say i 've ever listened to it no , i should give it a try i do like most music , what about you ?"
19666,"yeah somewhat . there is a band called bts , t hey are the most popular k pop band right now , they were doing a tour around the states , i keep seeing them on talk shows so i checked out their music , pretty cool . they have one song with nikki minaj too !"

19668,"haha right . hey its been fun chatting , have a good one !"
19669,"hi , do you use the computer a lot ?"
19670,hi . yes i do l i use it basically all day for all sorts of different hints . it 's hard to believe that computers were originally just calculating devices .
19671,yeah htey have come a very long way
19672,"hey realy have . i mean , think about it . the russians hae made a computer that runs on water !"
19673,that is amazing . and he lace shuttle computers puns on only 1 mb of ram
19674,"does it really ? that is very surprising . it 's hard to believe that co , punters a started from a simple program , a command to a machine ."
19675,yeah it is for sure . do yu have an apple or a pc
19676,i have a pc . i am not a big on apple products . i 've heard they can be problematic . do you have an apple or a p ?
19677,i have an apple . good think i do not smoke as i would void its warranty
19678,lol ! i remember hearings somethings bout that before ! is n't smoking around an apple considered z biohazard ?
19679,"yeah it is , i think that is what voids the warranty . crazy"
19680,that i crazy . it 's just as crazy as some people hoping to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks .
19681,"yeah , not sure how transhumanists are going to do that but it will be interesting to se"
19682,"i agree . maybe they should start with something smaller to experiment with first . something like a fish perhaps . then again , maybe they should study jellyfish . there 's a breed of them that is immortal ."
19683,yeah they have been doing that for a while now but can not crack their code
19684,"really ? i didnt now that ! i guess fish are more complicated than they see , i mean , even the way they drink is different . fresh water drink y osmosis n dealt water through their mouths ."
19685,yeah that is so cool how they have adapted . there are flesh that eat prey twice their size .
19686,"i wonder how they do the do that . now that i think it it , fish don used to be studied more . the nba fish has genes that are associated with human diseases ."
19687,"yeah , and they are often studies to figure out things about humans , there are lots of studies ."
19688,i like that fish can communicate . they use use acoustic communication which depends on the size and species of the fish ? .
19689,yeah that is really to . nice chat
19690,have you seen billy elliot ?
19691,i have n't . i hear it is a musical . have you seen it ?
19692,i hack seen the movie at least a dozen times . the musical is playing in arlington though .
19693,thats ' pretty cool ! i was n't aware there was a movie . do you like to dance ?
19694,"i do ! the dance number 's in the musical are supposed to be spectacular , especially ' angry dance ' ina 65 1 . dance i a great way to communicate , even outbid of musical 's ."
19695,"i 'm not great at dancing , gut i do like watching people dance . bruce lee was the one kong cha cha champion in 1958 ."
19696,who knew ? tupac was a dancer as well . he did ballet in high school . he even performed im then nutcracker .
19697,thats ' pretty awesome . i believe there 's a special part of the brain that cakes in music . babies spontaneously dance when they hear music . i think i read people witty memory loss can remember words to songs as wel l .
19698,"that 's crazy ! i wonder if i ever forget stuff , if me will help me . think that 's how elton john remembers ' a ll his songs ? he has some dove 30 million records ."
19699,"that 's crazy , he is quite the legend . they almost cut can you feel the love tonight from the lion king . i 'm really good they did n't !"
19700,me too ! i love that song . it 's probably my second favorite song of his behind candle int he wind .
19701,"yeah , it is definitely one of his best . his went on to wi nanu oscar ! i wonder if e will do anything for the new movie ?"
19702,i do n't know about the movie but i think he does all the music in the musical . it 's a tony winning musical .
19703,"yeah , it 's a pretty amazing musical . he preformed with ed sheeran nat the grammy because they said ed was not high profile enough ."
19704,"wow ! i love ed hs3eran 's music , i would have never guessed that . did you know elton he does n't write all his own music ?"
19705,oh yeah ? i did n't know that . i guess its 's a lot of music to write all on your own .
19706,"apparently , most of his songs were wrote by bernie tapping ."
19707,"well , hats off o bernie because he 's done a great job too !"
19708,i would say ! he came across hi randomly after he failed an audition for some talent search .
19709,that 's pretty lucky . the song called you song was given to elon as an upcoming artist .
19710,he 's had a great career . it was a nice chat !
19711,it was nice chatting i you too !
19712,do you think you will see the musical . now ? you should go this weekend !

19714,did you know bruce lee was a great dancer nad won hong kong 's chacha championship in 1958 . ?
19715,"no , i didn ot know that , but dancing and martial arts are alike when you think about it . it is about coordinated movements ."
19716,"yes , michael jackson has a patent on a device allowing him to lean extremely in some dance moves ."
19717,"ye , there was a peg in the floor and a hole in the sole of his shoe so he hadnt o spent it so he would be the only one to use it ."
19718,"babies actual , fly spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile hen hitting the beat . how sweet !"
19719,"yeah , the appreciation of utube is in our genes it seems every culture has their dance moves and music ."
19720,elton john was actually born regional kenneth dwight and worker with lyricist bernie tapping since 1967 collaboration on more than 30 albums .
19721,"they have met because elton could not write songs and bernie could not sing . , sometime destiny works ."

19724,wow . he is sell more tha 300 million records .
19725,"i wonder if he is rich than the pros minister of australia ? how position ncis low even in the constitution , his salary must b below ."
19726,"maybe . the prime minister of uk has a cat , and it has the title of chief mouser , funny huh"
19727,"chief mouser ? tupaq nwas mouse king in the nutcracker , i do n't think they would go well together ."
19728,"in japan , the prime minister sends a silver cup to celebrate , but so may tuned 100 so they had to find a way to make cheaper cups"
19729,"they are ceremonial , t hey do n't even ti be study , not like pointes for ballet dancers , they can go through 4 pairs in a week ."

19749,is n't that amazing ? he 's written songs or other bands too ! who knows ow many !
19750,"i would be curious to know . i 'll hve to ok that up . his breakout hit ' yours one ' was original , a recorded by the band three dog night , but they did n't release it as a single as they wanted to let elton have a trip it it ."
19751,that 's wonderful . i remember watching him sing candle in the wind after diana died . i 'm not ashamed to say it makes me cry .
19752,i remember that . i think everyone got a very eyed . the rewritten version of that song ford an sold over 33 million copies alone !
19753,elton john has met kings and the prime minister here his music . o look forward go watching teh movie .
19754,yes a i 'm looking forward to seeing it as well . did you know that gwen yo turn 100 in japan the prime minister sends you a silver cup to celebrate ? that 's interesting !
19755,oh that 's cool ! i had no idea !
19756,"hows it going , are you a big basebal an ? in canada they call kickball soccerbaseball ,"
19757,i love baseball . did you know that managers wear uniforms because hey would literally play for their team if they want ?
19758,i didnt know that was why the wore uniforms but i 've heard of managers playing in games before
19759,are you a fan of either the yankees or red sox ?
19760,"yea i 'm a yankees fans , it 's pretty cool they were known as the highlanders before 1913"
19761,so you must 've heard about the two yankees that swapped families ? that 's a bit weird .
19762,"i actually have n't , pretty weir duo swap families , i wondered if they nicknamed the team"
19763,ha ! yankee player sand fans are an interesting bunch . bill o'reilly created a fake press organization in college just so he could get season tickets .
19764,"that 's pretty smart , too ad o'reilly 's idea would n't work nowadays"
19765,how do you feel about the red you ? did you know taht hey 're partially owned by the new york times ?
19766,"that is quite ironic . it 's pretty funny the red sox cant win a game . ben afflecks ' birthday , guess hes bad luck"
19767,his patriots seen to be doing just i though . the red sox have still won 9 championships too .
19768,"that 's not too bad , i never knew there was another boston year called the red stacking , that city seems obsessed with feet"
19769,"yeah , they changed their name because their manager thought red dye was dangerous ."
19770,"that 's pretty odd , did you know the first game at fenway was against the new york highlanders ?"
19771,who ? i remember hearing about them not being able to defeat heir 1903 championship excuse the other team did n't at to play
19772,"that is strange , i wonder why the new york giants refused to play the red sox in the world series"
19773,why do you think they did ?
19774,"i have no clue , maybe the ny giants lost to them the previous year on bad calls and were protesting"
19775,maybe they were mad that bobby richardson won a world series mvp even thouhg he lost the series
19776,"well i got to go , nice talking with you"
19777,are you a fan of baseball ?
19778,"i know a little bit about what is going on , but to say i was a fan would b estretchijngt he truth ."
19779,did yu know that in 1973 2 yankees pitchers swapped families ?
19780,swapped families ? is thats ome kind of baseball term 9 'm not familiar with ?
19781,"no , they switched families ."
19782,stat must have made an awkward dressing room . so who 's this lost yankees player ?
19783,"yeah , it seems pretty weird . did you know a player got suspended for refusing to get a haircut ?"
19784,"it seems a bit extreme , but i guess i should see his hair before passing judgement . what i find interesting is that the new york times owns part of the boston team ."
19785,"yeah , it was don mattingly , a t the time he played first base ."
19786,"i know there is a big rivalry between boston and new york , it would sacrilege for a ne york business to hav rap interest in a boston team ."
19787,the red sox have lost every game on afflecks birthday since goodwin hunting was released .
19788,"i 'm aware what affleck is a big boston fan , i wonder how he feels about taht . i think , aside fro taht , his team has done fairly well these past years ."
19789,i 'm not sure . did you see the movie goodwin hunting ? i thought it was good .
19790,"my wife is it , i have not seen it . i hear the owners of the boston team own othe esports teams around the world ."
19791,"interesting , it would n't surprise me , but i 'm not sure that it is n't a conflict of interest ."
19792,i suppose as long as the teams do n't compete actively with one another it should be fine .
19793,interesting . did you know a man found 3 million in baseball cards in his grandfathers attic ?
19794,"i should go and visit mine , see if ther eis anything hidden up there . who would have thought some simple cards could be worth so much ?"
19795,"i used to have a baseball card collection , i should check and see what it is worth ."
19796,"do you have an oldie allies card , or is he too new of a player ?"
19797,"no , i do n't . i only have cards from the 80s . nice chatting with you !"
19798,"hello . it 's odd hat baseball managers are also part of the team , and can play if they are needed ."
19799,"that is very odd need ! i also find it odd that no palmer has ever attempted to catch a ball with his hat . but if htey do , the opposing team receives three free bases so perhaps that 's why ."
19800,that 's very weird . so is the term ' soccer baseball ' .
19801,ha ! i 've never heard that one before ! but i have heard of the albuquerque isotopes minor league team that was named after a team in the simpson 's ! ha !
19802,"weirdly , the new york times are partial owners of the boston red sox ."
19803,"is that so ? that 's kind of ironic , is n't it ? i o know that lebron is lso a member of the group that owns the red sox as well as f liverpool !"
19804,yeah . ; lebron is to a lot of things . too bad he has an attitude since moving to la . i wonder where the ' lost ' yankee player is ?
19805,i 'm not sure of that one ! but did you know ben affleck forced the gone girl production to shut down for 4 days because he refused to wear a new york yankees cap on screen ? he 's a huge red sox fan . that 's going overboard and taking it way too far .
19806,"actors and other celebs are so peculiar . bil o'reilly had a fake press organization in college to get season tickets to the yankees , it worked ."
19807,ha ! so true ! i do think it 's cool that wrigley and fenway are the only two ballparks that are over 100 years old .
19808,are they ? wow . i guess don mattingly was suspended because he did n't wath to cut his hair . how weird .
19809,that is weird . kind of liek bobby richardson is the only player to win world series mvp despite actually posing the series .
19810,many japanese are surprised to hear that baseball is poouaor here .
19811,are they really ? i wonder why ? i also wonder if japan 's pro baseball league uses as many balls as the mlb in a single season which is 160k .
19812,"maybe ? i think i would prefer the n . y highlanders , over the ny yankees ."
19813,"speaking of the yankees , did you know their famous logo predates the team ? it was actually designed by tiffany and co . for a medal of major for a fallen police officer , john mcdowell , way back in 1975 ."
19814,"yes , i did . i have a book on tiffany history . if i were to find a box of baseball cards , i would throw them ou t , unlike the man who found millions in his grandfather 's attic ."
19815,ha ! i need t heck y attic then ! i wonder if a card exists on the 17 year old girl who was banned from baseball for striking out both babe ruth and lou gehrig ?
19816,"ho ; fully , she is a national treasure . weirdly , two yankees pitchers swapped families . permanently ."
19817,"i wonder why ? that 's kind of strange ! do you think ny cubs fans swapped families the last time they won back to back world series titles , which happened to be the last time they won a series ?"
19818,"i do n't know . thank you for chatting it me , have a wonderful day ."
19819,"nice chatting with you ! and before i o , always remember the yankees do n't put the player ' z last names on the back of their jerseys because they feel it puts needed attention on the players when the attention should be on the team as a whole . take care , friend !"
19820,hi there ! are you a baseball fan at all ?
19821,hello ! i am ! i do ' really have a team but like the red so x ! how about you ?
19822,"oh man , i 'm a long time snake fan . ca n't stand the re sox !"
19823,the snakes have been fu unto watch too ! i 'm from the midwest so you do n't have to hate m ahaha . do you know which two ballparks are over 100 years old ?
19824,hmm i 'm pretty sure fenway is . i visited it a couple of years ago . i 'll admit it 's pretty cool . the other one is probalby wrigley right ?
19825,did you go to a yankee sox game there ? that would be so cool to see that ! that is correct foe bot h !
19826,i did n't . i just happened o be in boston and decided to stop in since there was a game . did you know the red sox were partly owned by the new york times ?
19827,oh that 's cool ! i did n't know that ! lebron james is part of the tea tthat and the red sox as well !
19828,is he ? that 's lame ! ! not a lebron fan over here . isn ; t he a yankee fan too ?
19829,he 's a fan of whatever cakes him money lol . i know he affleck hate 'the yankees !
19830,who do you think will dmb better this year ?
19831,i 'm thinking the yankees because they have all this young talent who are stating to play well together !
19832,yeah boston has the pitching advantage thoug . we do n't have an answer for chris sale . plus i think boston has better lure hitters .
19833,that 's true ! at least they play each other like 15 times so we can se napa . did you see that crazy ball in the hat rule that baseball has ?
19834,ball in the hat ? no i do n't think i have .
19835,apparently the opposing team receives three bases if a player catches a basebal line their hat . . . make zero sense lol .
19836,that ca n't b cereal . whew only have seen it happen . i do know managers can technically play . that 's why they wear uniforms .
19837,i wounder if anybody was jumped in ? i can see old tommy lasorda jumping in a dodgers made when he was managing lol .
19838,haha man i think that guy is still around making wine or something .
19839,"i 'm sure he is . he hs to be 1000 years old now lol . anyways , had a great chat , have an awesome night !"
19840,thanks ! enjoy the rest of the night . got a fantasy baseball draft coming up
19841,"thanks , got ta research for mine !"
19842,"how 's it going , do you follow baseball ? hte nationals are n't doing too good after losing 30 to the red sox"
19843,"yeah , they just stuck big i . and i doubt it 's going to improve much . thos errors like saverin not blocking that pitch in the dirt are very hard to shake ."
19844,yea to as so bad the nationals called a players only meeting but i dont lee it sleeping much
19845,"the manager , martinez , is very typical rash a kind of guy but that does n't win games . they need to play better . did popping out to end the game seems to demonstrate howe ad they are ."
19846,brick feuds shoulder scoreless does n't help either
19847,true . that kind of injury can nag on for the rest of the season . maybe they need a girl pitcher . did you know there was a guy year old girl got banned back in the day for striking out rush and gehrig . that ' x what they need .
19848,"no , that is strange . maybe the manager can play in the game since they technically allowed to play"
19849,"whoops , i meant 17 year model girl . i had heard about managers playing , it would be fun to see that actually happen . i 'm kind of surprised actually because my oakland a 's have done so many crazy things . that rule is so obscure that everybody knows i wo like catching the bal , in your hat gives the other team three bases ."
19850,you know i think pete rose places a few games while he was a manager but pete was one crazy dude
19851,you might be right about that . he could ever addict to being too old to play . my daughter live just down the street from fenway park in boston . new of the two 100 year old parks l
19852,"i 've been to fenway once , it 's pretty crazy their first game was against the ny highlanders"
19853,those highlanders became the yankees in 1913 so that does make 100 years . that club started as the baltimore orioles in 1901 . i bet there were some odd rules back then .
19854,"i 'm sure , speaking of odd 2 yankee pitchers swapped families in 1973"
19855,"wow ! that 's really ' trading places ' . one thing i dont time about the yankees is they do n't have names of their uniforms . i guess they are supposed to be so famous that everyone knows them . although the club claims the 's to , mepahsize the team element of the game ."
19856,i guess that 's a major reason why there is a ' lost ' yankee player
19857,"you mean some kind of ghost ? baseball is all of stories , like how the sox name came from noah webster 's plan to amplify spelling . boston rand chicago bought in anyway ."
19858,"i figured it wa just because people in boston and chicago have horrible accents , especially boston saying sox instead of socks lol"
19859,"yeah , especially boston . can hardly understand some of them . when i play video basebal flame with my boy he always wants to be the albuquerque isotopes . that name was actually made up of teh simpson 's show . i prefer the birmingham biscuits . we have a lot of fun ."
19860,you ever play soccerbaseball aka kickball ?
19861,"no since 3rd grade ! but my grown up hipster daughter and her friends do . i guess it also involves beer . since ml buses about 160 , 000 balls a year , i guess they me to sell a lot of beer too , to pay for it all ."
19862,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
19863,are you a baseball fan ?
19864,"hello , i love baseball . what about you ?"
19865,"yeah , it 's one of my favorite sport ."
19866,did you know the opposing team receives 3 bases if a player catches a baseball in their hat ?
19867,"no , i 've never seen that before , but that 's probably why ."
19868,there is a baseball team that was named after the baseball team in the simpsons .
19869,"that 's funny , i wonder if they 're an good . do you collect baseball cares ?"
19870,i love basetball cards . i used to collect them when i was litle 3d o you collect them ?
19871,"yeah , i used to collect them . i heard ome guy found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cars in his grandfathers attic ."
19872,"wow that would be an awesome find ! in season of mlb baseball , they can go through 160 , 000 baseballs , ."
19873,that 's a lot of baseballs . i wonder how many bats they go through h ?
19874,i bet not nearly as many bats . they do n't see to break very often .
19875,i heard baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their team . i would love to see that .
19876,i have heard that too . have you ever see na manager play before ?
19877,"no , i would pay to see one of them step up fo the plate ."
19878,i would love to see that too . do you like the yankees ?
19879,"u 'm neutral towards them , but i do n't hate them like some people ."
19880,i 'm about the same . do you like the red sox ?
19881,i feel the same about them as well . how about you ?
19882,pretty much the same . i like the red sox over the yankees .
19883,i heard teh new york time town part of the red sox .
19884,"that 's a coo facts to know . wel l , it was good talking to you . take care ."
19885,do you like baseball ?
19886,yes i do . do you now why the managers wear uniforms ?
19887,yeah because they ca pay if the team needs them to
19888,yeah . do you know what kickball i socalled in canada ?
19889,it is called soxcerabseball
19890,yeah . d you know who used to . the mlb schedule for a long time ?
19891,yes a couple and they did it for 24 years straight
19892,"yeah and they scheduled games each year , crazy right ?"
19893,yeah i know . did you hear of that guy that made a fortune from baseball cards ?
19894,yes theyd here his grandfather 's in the attic of the house
19895,yesh he mad 2 total of 3 million by selling them
19896,yeah . in japan is super popular that they can not believe it is pastime here
19897,yeah . do you like the yankees ?
19898,yes i do . the pitchers in swapped families permanently
19899,did you know there is a lost yankee player
19900,wow cool . bil . o'reilly faked s press organization just so he could get free tickets to their games
19901,and the best part about that is that it worked for him

19908,"i , not sur see did you knoe that the yankees hav epa storied history . in 1973 two yankees pitchers swapped families permanently ."
19909,"thatd as not make sense . i think the wives would novice . washington lost 18 of the past 24 games . cool , a relaxed team ."
19910,i think the ones must have been ok with it if it as permanent .
19911,only of the managers of the washington nationals they would get better . he was right . he would also be right in saying a coin lands on head or tails .
19912,that is tru he was . he yankees actually began play in 1901 as the baltimore orioles .
19913,"so th renew york yankees played s the baltimore are 's . thats pretty strange . was it the bird , or the cookie that came firs ."
19914,i would say in histoy the bird probably came first . lol . the yankees have a los player . im gon na have to o some research on that . it sounds interesting to say the least .
19915,"yes , research is required for that one . bill o'reilly pulled a neat stick . i wonder if i could do the same today ?"
19916,i dont know . it got hi season tickets to the yankees so hey give it a try .
19917,i would like to try . there are so many statistics about basebal . its nauseating . the red sox have lost every game on ben afflecks birthday since they forgot how to spell socks .
19918,di you know that th renew york time in part owns the red sox .
19919,"so , the means that a new york newspaper prints articles about a baseball team . truly the end of the world that is . a dying media owning a physical tea we if only they owned a virtual team . ,"

19923,"really ? fascinating . the red sox might be worth more money , bu 'the small capacity of fenway park prevents them from getting much attendance . the 1 spot dog and 5 beer dont help either ."
19924,in 1991 the yankees suspended don mattingly for refusing to get a haircut .
19925,don mattingly ? i wonder what the real was um maybe he wanted long hair . strange rules .
19926,i dont know probably just arguing just to argue . did you know that bobby richardson won the world series mvp but that they lost the series that year .
19927,"did bobby score for the other team ? anyway , have a goo dday ."

19939,"that is an interesting fact . i did not know that . do you mean , pitch or play other positions ? bases ?"
19940,"i think anything , that is why they alway swear a uniform as well . not like in other sports where the coach wears a suit and tie !"
19941,wow that is so cool . i never knew that . apparently ther eis also a ' lost ' yankees player . how does that happen ?
19942,"taht is super strange , i never heard that before i might have to google that one ."
19943,"so a man found 3 million dollars worth of 190 baseball cards , wow . if you were in that situation , would you sell or keep ?"
19944,"nice , i would keep some of them but definitely sel at least a million worth . i could use the money to buy some awesome tickets to real games ."
19945,"that 's along the lines of want i would do , sell some and keep some . which brewers player is your favorite ? so far i like relics ."
19946,"relic is so awesome , i love his attitude and how humble he is , and thats ' on top of him being one of the best in the whole league . my favorite was probalby oral this year though lol ."

19981,"yes , and i heard lebron james is in part of an owner as well !"

19998,"yeah . the reds by are owned by the same company that owns liverpool fc , and i hate them ."
19999,"the new york times also has a share in them too , it 's crazy how people invest ins sports now"

20018,"i didd not know that . i know ha clint eastwood is an avid jazz film , he puts it in his film"
20019,oh that 's coo . ia m excited tax see his new film called ex . jazz players grew goatees aa it provided comfort when playing . that makes a lot of sense .

20027,"yeah i ca n't believe he never was , it was like leonardo dicaprio . the universe can be a crazy place sometimes . in fact the universe maybe one giant super hologram ."
20028,"for sure , leo ! the universe is so crazy , like it maybe being one minaj superhologram"
20029,oh very interesting hey indeed . there is also a theory that there is only one electron in the universe . i do n't quite believe that one as much .
20030,"dang , i do n't believe that much but i dont have the proof note o believe that lol . i love the universe"
20031,lot is a very unique concept . there are stars in the known universe that we cold enough to be touched by the human hand .
20032,"i work love to experience that in my lifetime , but it probably wo n't happen . touching a star . good chatting witch you !"

20038,"yeah there are a lot of good theories as well , also the one that the universe exist sin a black hole ."
20039,o have n't heard that one . . . actually that one makes sense to me . although does the black hole exist in another universe ? did you hear the theory tha the universe is actually one giant superhologram ?
20040,"i have no idea , i think the theory is really complex and i did hear about that one i think its best to keep an open ind but i do n't believe that theory is true ."
20041,i absolutely agree . are you a fan of jazz ?
20042,"i am a ' of the genre yeah , it has deep roots that go to african communities of new orleans ."
20043,"yes , it 's thought of as america 's classical music . i recently learned that jazz trumpeters grew goatees for comfort thiel playing , no to the look !"
20044,"ive always wondered bout those goatees , they look really funny , i guess they serve a purpose and it was makes sense now ."
20045,"yes , i always thought they were funny . when i thin koi a jazz player i think of the muppet , lol ."

20052,"ella fitzgerald was another jazz player she thought herself to sing 2 notes at once , seems like she ha a talent for music"
20053,"wow , two notes at once ? i never noticed , i ponder how jann singers can do that . very impressive ! i guess clint eastwood is a fan of jazz he included t ana even scorer several of hi films with it !"
20054,"maybe clint eastwood redid that as well , his one of my favorite actors but anyways its lunch time it was great chatting with you friend ."

20069,"i guess movies have tricked us all ! didnt know about that , interesting fact though"

20157,"yeah , he could converse in ancient greek too ! that is amazing . i cant even di those things now ."
20158,"nope i ca n't either ! it 's truly remarkable , what about comedies though , are yu at least interested in those ? i know that i love all murray"
20159,i love comedy . bill murray was great in ghostbusters .
20160,"yep he also recommend that got watch the movie kung gf hustle , he calls it a supreme achievement , hav you ever seen it"
20161,"nope , so i cant fully agree or disagree with him"
20162,"i think the movies ok , one movie i did n't like was green lantern with ryan reynolds , they should have made it z comedy wth jack black , that sounds musc better"
20163,game you watched skyscraper ' it was a good movie ! full of action
20164,for me skyscraper was decent . at least tit was better than the meg
20165,the meg had the world 's biggest shark . i rather watch jaws .
20166,"while the meg was like jews , bu bigger was n't better was the film was blindly satisfying and equally forgeful"
20167,that movie got 2 stars . hat a shame .
20168,"jaws was a god movie that unfortunately made people very any afraid of sharks . did you know even sharks have rescued sailors ? in any case the meg is a hollywood rehash of things that our , but are terrible"
20169,"that is true . there has been some news about people getting killed by sharks , swimming in the open . there are other sharks that are safe , but make sure to be witht rained swimmers . it gives a different perspective of how sharks are through meg ."
20170,"even then , the meg takes its sweet time to start going , are delivering thet drills and chills expected of such a film . its series of close calls become growing comedic rather than believable or action packed ."
20171,"well , it does seem coed due to the enormous shark . they should have the genre to comedy instead of action ."
20172,"at that point it is funny just because of how bad it is . . . as an actor statham does well , but ca n't carry this film like his rival johnson ."
20173,"interesting , did you know that jack black starred in best of the comedy falls such as green lantern ?"
20174,"i thought jack black was originally going to star in green lantern , which was going to be a comedy , but he ended up not being in red lantern ?"
20175,"wow , that is a . jack black should have been chosen ."
20176,"the chance of it being a better film as a comedy is very high . personally , i tend to be bias towards comedy since its purpose is to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter"
20177,true . hve you watched comedy central l ?
20178,not really . i only recently read that they cancelled over 100 shows since it was created in 1989
20179,you can watch it . youtube . they should have them still .
20180,what is comedy central offer int germs of content ?
20181,"well , they have improvisation . i personally thought it was funny ."
20182,are they like monty python ? they also do a lot of improv like hte parrot sketch
20183,"yes , it is similar . it was nice chatting with you ."
20184,hi have you seen the meg movie ?
20185,"i saw in the theater ! i though tit was pretty interesting , although it got mediocre ratings ."
20186,it looks pretty good . is it like jaws ? i have n't seen it yet .
20187,it was a like a fancy new age jaws but with jason statahm and rugby rose .
20188,nic a i 'm going to have to check it out . did you know that sharks can be trained liek doh to bark ? odd . . .
20189,a barking shark ? ! that is odd from a cartilaginous fish !
20190,i know . . . . and how in the heck did they ever to decide ' hey . . . let 's see if we can make a shard mark ! ' lol
20191,maybe it began with pet shark ? indonisia has a community with shark pets .
20192,what sounds different . lol i would ike to see them videos of the white shark cafe in the middle of the pacific ocean . it 's where great white sharks congregate .
20193,sharks are ticklish . o wonder if they laugh along with bark ?
20194,how do they know that ? lol sharks evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees . maybe that has something to do with it .
20195,i would look to see some research on by scientists on this issue . scientists gain knowledge based on their research .
20196,"yep . they must have done some research on how not only dolphins , butts sharks can rescue sailors too . i woudl n't have eaten to be hte guinea pg in that research project . lol"
20197,people have to be scientists or magicians to own a rabbit in queensland . what a silly law .
20198,i 've never heard that . i wonder why ? . . a magician too ? lol
20199,i find it humorous comedy that magicians are the only there exception to the rabbit ownership rule .
20200,yes . odd for sure . the world wide web was invented by an english scientist in 1989 . they really developed it fast because i remember being able to go online and 1995
20201,the good old days of dial up connections . major expense went into developing it . i wonder how it compares to the 200 million budget for evan almighty .
20202,i loved that movie ? do you like comedies ?
20203,i do ! i wish they were up for oscars becaue they are deserving and it has been 37 years since he on .
20204,i love them too . i did n't realize that comedy central was created in 1989 . same year as the world wide web !
20205,that was a big year for important things ! nice meeting you !
20206,"kanya newest was really seriously a happy man while playing family fued . , last ' the ."
20207,"haha i think so , he was very spirited with his shouting and ' dragon energy ' haha"
20208,"yah , dragon energy he said hes haired with trump of all people ."
20209,"ya pretty crazy , also he was born in 1977 and has sold about 120 million record so he 's no slouch"
20210,yes he is a very popular rapper .
20211,"oh ya for sure , bur hes kind of crazy he thinks aids was man made"
20212,hahaha ! true . he has some real funny ideas .
20213,"sup very werid , he is nice though once he gave his mic to a wheelchair bound fan"
20214,"yes , he di did he also sings some gospel songs ! that was shocking to me . he has a wide range of cage sin his approach to steep people diff their feet ."
20215,"oh definitely , and he has a history of off color interruptions , like at that award ceremony witht taylor swift"
20216,he 's supposed to be the only one out of the top 10 most successful songs of all time that is in a minor key !
20217,"that is impressive , do you pike kim kardashian at halo ?"
20218,"yes , i do . she hit tvs liek no tomorrow and got extremely high pay , especially in 2015 when she took the highest paid reality television personality !"
20219,"ya she hit the found running , weird that she used to be the personal assistant for paris hilton !"
20220,"everyone as to start somewhere . y ithink ? stat 2003 sex tape with her former boyfriend , ray j that got leaked in 2007 helped push her to the forefront ."
20221,"oh definitely , and now shes married to kanye west and in fallout boy music video !"
20222,"who would have ever thought kanye west ? h hahaha ! yah , she jumped tight in there in 2025 and they go thee kids right off the bat !"
20223,"lol y ashe did , and her father got famous from being par tofu oj 's defense team , i remember that"
20224,true ! she hit tha top 100 most influential people in 215 and was mastered all over time magazine !
20225,"yup the as , do you like rap music ? i guess tupac 's music was given to the library of congress because not was deemed ' culturally significant '"
20226,"personally , there is very little rap that i like . tupac ks a big name in thye industry akon with eminem ."
20227,"ya , i was just shocked they rap in korea and o ' compliment battles ' sounds crazy"
20228,"hello , do you like sharks '"
20229,i thinkk hey ware pretty neat ! i dont want to swim with them though .
20230,they are amazing animals . sahara have no rib cages which means on the land htey van crush their own body .
20231,i think it is coo tthat they rescue sailors . you hey are no other monster jaws makes the out to be .
20232,i think so too . sharks evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees .
20233,wow 21 that is amazing . i would have expected he other two to be first .
20234,md too . great white sharks congregate in the middle of the pacific in an area know as the white shark cafe .
20235,also known as the place you wont did me .
20236,haha right ! sharks can be trained like dogs to bark .
20237,that would be the scariest sound to hear right before it eats you . . . lol
20238,i agree lol . do you like science ?
20239,i do . i find it fascinating gf . im no scientist though .
20240,i do too . one of the emperor of japan is a scientist and still publishes papers to that day .
20241,wow . to had we cant elect someone with that intellect .
20242,i agree . harrison schmitt got he only scientist to walk on the moon .
20243,you would have thought more of the astronauts would have been scientists .
20244,i would think so soo . harvard scientists stored a gif animation of a galloping house in the dna of bacteria .
20245,den beginning to understand how hat is one baffles me .
20246,i agree . it does n't even make sense to em . do you like comedy ?
20247,i do ! it has to be my favorite genre !
20248,i think it 's great . nothing better than a good laugh !
20249,the green lantern was supposed to be a comedy n the beginning .
20250,good talking to you
20251,"hi , how are you ? seeing a study saying ? rapping ' the brain decrease aggressive intentions ."
20252,i have read that brain stimulation help present future violence .
20253,i wonder how long it lasts ;
20254,according to na article i read it depends on the experiment
20255,intresting . are you a fiction reader at all ?
20256,i do . did you know what in 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic caused it has a black character
20257,i wish i were surprised . i also see taht george rr martin of game of thrones hates fan fiction .
20258,wow . i did n't know that . talking about something else did you know that windows 95 was the second most intalled piece of software on computers . windows has been for a long time
20259,on a hugs percent of computers . apparently smoking near apple computers voids the warranty for a biohazard .
20260,i wonder how can smoking affect it . it also amazing the fact that the first windows computer at stanford was constructed from lego bricks .
20261,i really dont kno wb some people want to be able to upload their minds top memory sticks . strange thought .
20262,i know . but in those days there are better devices to use . i read something funny the other day about that it is a illegal to own a rabbit in queensland . can you believe that ?
20263,i wonder why ?
20264,do n't know . but will find out later . another interesting fact is that matt patricia is the only rocket scientist acting in the nfl .
20265,"he 's a smart guy , good luck to him with the lions ."
20266,do you know it t is true that before coaching he was a working aeronautical engineer ?
20267,"id onto now on that , more impressive he has a potential career outside football !"
20268,sure . i read he was graduated from rpi
20269,what is rpi ?
20270,"i think it is a school whoper fight song includes sin , cosine and tangent and some other things i ca n't remember"
20271,thats funny ! i want hear the song . have a great day !
20272,hi there . i like watching reality tv as a guilty pleasure and kim and kenya are at top of my list . how about you ?
20273,"i do n't watch reality tv , but i heard the family feud episode they 're on is worth watching !"
20274,"yeah , me too . i watched it and it was a hoot . i have never seen kenya smile and be a happy person . the most steve harvey is so funny and great that it would be hard not tos mile around him ."
20275,to 'll have to to it up ! it would be weird seeing kanye as a likeable person ! what is it about the reality tvs hows with them do you like ?
20276,i think it is just the shock value . the blimps on family feud into another aspect of the all was interesting too because they were in a fun environment . kanye has released some good music and some dark cracked psyched ind of music too they are like watching ga train wreck .
20277,"how weird , i 'm sure if i had cable i would be hooked into i t ! i heard kim kardashian used to be a personal assistant to paris hilton ."
20278,"oh wow , thats crazy , really ? i wonder if she traveled and everything with paris ?"
20279,"yes , shes traveled as her stylist ! i wonder how paris hilton feels about her former stylist outfaming that ? !"
20280,"probably sour and me , lol . i know that vogue magazine said that kim is a trail blazer an da pop culture phenomenon ."
20281,"is that right ? i 've heard that she 's a trailblazer of the ' selfie movement ' , not na honor i would be proud of ! d o you know any other interesting facts about her ?"
20282,well yes i do . she was reported to be the highest paid reality star . 2015 andre red more than 53 million dollars . seth also was in a music video early on un her career for the final out boys .
20283,"my goonies ! all at money for putting your life onto the tv , how crazy ! ! ! i wonder if that music video is very good , i do like the fall out boys . do you think she would have become famous if it were ? t door her dad being on the defense team for oj simpson n ?"
20284,"i think her dad helped the cause for sure but yo make a good point , i do n't know . he has done some good things with her money and fame also ."
20285,"that 's true , she advocates to raise awareness for the armenian genocide . it 's nice hen people putt themselves to a cause ."
20286,". , exactly . i was raised in an area here that was an important cause overlooked by may . he did as armenian ."
20287,"are you armenian ? that 's horrible about th genocide , i do n't think i would have heard of it if it was n't for her efforts ."
20288,"i am not but was raised in a town that many migrate to and it was a known subject to me my whole life . kim was also interesting in her pick for a human d , that is another reason i follow jerk crazy decisions . kanye omari west was born in 1977 and he has one of the top 10 most successful songs of all time , gold digger . i hat do say i like the song ."
20289,"and it as the only song eh wrote in a minor key ! you would think , given it 's success , that he would write more songs in that key . . . that the that 's the secret to it 's success ? ?"
20290,"i think you are on ti something , hmmm . i am gon na be skim 's book ' selfish ' and content , ate . thank you for the fun chat , have a god one !"
20291,it was a fun chat ! have a great day !
20292,"you do , i liked the crazy topics we explored k see ya ."
20293,computers are sofa fascinating and we 've come so far with them .
20294,yeah . i ca n't imagine my commodore 64 today . . .
20295,"no , we had no graphics or storage back then . now they are used for everything . even factories have industrial robots ."
20296,have you ever seen th boston dynamics robots that can run and jump on boxes ?
20297,i have not . that is intriguing and i will have to look that up . can you believe that the space shuttle general purpose computer runs on only 1mb of ram ? !
20298,"if i am an astronaut , i am little worried about going into space with a computer with 1m of ram . . . what are they doing ? ? ? ?"
20299,i am a little worried also just because i would think they would need mork for such complicated processes n older to be safe . id id not kno what computers even existed in 1936 . in that year russians made a computer that ran on water .
20300,"wow , that 's crazy ! they are not the ones i associate with the invention of the computer ."
20301,i 'm not that versed on computer history unfortunately . at this point we are so far past what we were . someone built a 16bit computer using nothing but basic minecraft building blocks and it works .
20302,i would be interested in kno if swapping the brain also worded on cte or overly aggressive football players doing bad off the field .
20303,that 's a good question . biology is a fascinating subject a are you interested in science ?
20304,i am . i studied it the first 3 years of college and then organic chemistry suggested i move on from that .
20305,i took every biology course i could in high school land a few in college and i was n't even a science major ri just enjoy it . scientists at harvard stored a gif of a galloping horse i nthe da of bactwi . i do n't understand how that 's even possible ? !
20306,have you heard about crisp ? i listened to a podcast about it and the science was completely over my head . i got out at the right is . . .
20307,i have not but i will look into it because on 'm always curious to know more . did you know that only one scientist has lake on the moon ? i find that surprising .
20308,"yeah , that is strange . i thought there would be more . maybe they are at mission control or they are more engineers ? pull you ever want to go into space ?"
20309,no was . i think its ' fascinating but i 'll stick to the safety of seeing it in pictures ha ha . how about yourself ?
20310,"nope ! i remember watching 2 shuttles explode and i do n't want that to happen . plus i woul diss my wife and kids too much ! i find the people going to spacex , an proven spacecraft , crazy !"
20311,the challenger was horibel . i do n't know what the spacex people are thinking . i was unaware that the emperor of japan is a scientist who still publishes papers .
20312,"wow , that 's interesting . i think kim jong un ha a degree in physics but who 's going to fail him so i question it 's legitimate . . ."
20313,he makes a lot of crazy statements so ish iggy doubt got but you 're right k his people ca n't question it .
20314,nice chatting with you !
20315,you as well .
20316,good evening . just sing o at my computer ; not sure i could live without it .
20317,why do you say that . if you do n't mind e asking ?
20318,"i just use it so much i guess . did you know that way back in the 1930s , russian created a waterrun computer ?"
20319,really ? no i have n't heard of that before . so they use water to power up a computer ? i wonder what was the list in that .
20320,"who knows . i 'm all for utilizing ever things , but i just ca n't believe it worked very well ."
20321,lol i bet . . . . so any you into comics ?
20322,"i used to be . for about three years when i was younger add then tried avid as an adult , but it was an expensive hobby . i love fiction though . you ?"
20323,i 'm kinda in the same boat as you . i just read hat in the 1950s a judge tried duo van a science fiction comic becasue emit featured lab lack character . smh
20324,we have come along way since then . i know george rr martin would like to hang ll fan fiction !
20325,"really , why do you say that ?"
20326,on the one hand he sees it underlining copyright laws and on the other he sees it as potentially hurting someone pursuing writing .
20327,he has a pink i guess . . . but i like reading fan fiction .
20328,"i wonder if you 've ever come across fan fiction written by julius caesar . it seems crazy ti believe , but i guess whe he was doing he wrote about hercules nd oedipus !"
20329,yeah i read an article about that . i wonder who would win in a fight it came down to hulk vhs hercules ?
20330,"in the marvel universe i think it 's hulk no problem , but i do n't know how closest to the myth marvel went with their version of the characters ."
20331,"it you know that there ' sa wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities . i wonder f hercules and there then i could rank him agains 'the but , ."
20332,we just need the get on our computers or atl east et oyu top scientists to look into the issue .
20333,haha . . . i know right . get some egg heads on it lol . do you know any scientists ?
20334,the emperor of japan is also a scientist and is still publishing papers . do you know any ?
20335,nope ca n't say that i o . . . but it was nice talking to you tho .
20336,you too !
20337,"hello , have you heard of the possibility of stimulating the brain with maps to decrease aggressive instincts ."
20338,"that is quite amazing , like something from science fiction . i just wonder if it will really translate to real life . it seems the test was to zap the prefrontal cortex and then have participants rate how they respond after reading a story with digression . i know you can not be tin real life , i 'm just not sue how realistic the reading exercise is ."
20339,"itd definitely feels like science fiction ! it 's crazy how rapidly scientists are innovating , i believe the term scientist was ? t even a regular thing until he 19th century , and look where we are not !"
20340,"in some ways i agree , lie creating this computerized devices to electronically stimulated he brain . its a bit scary taht external devices can manipulate the brain 's tiring ."
20341,"absolutely , at the same time i think it 's important to remember this is nothing definite yet . the researchers , olivia cry , still maintains this is just an early step ."
20342,"i agree . but tom bummer at indiana university school of medicine points out that th biggest limitation o 'the study is the difficulty of measuring actual aggresskon in the lab . so , while it initially may show promise , hte next step is to develop better experimental methods to more accurately measure the effects ."
20343,with better mentors thought i have a lot of hope for the future . amazing things come ou do science . even the world wide web was invented by an english scientist .
20344,"at the same time , scientist can be an eccentric bunch . do you know that there is a ' steve ' project regarding evolution in which a signature must be named steve . some variation thereof ?"
20345,"i did n't know that no ! that seems very interesting and confusing , i wonder who came up with it ."
20346,i 'm not more . a the same time they can be quite inventive in the most unusual ways . did you know that the first google computer was housed in an enclosure made from lego bricks . great 's a long way from the google soft today !
20347,wow it 's crazy how people can make something from nothing . i saw once that someone used basic minecraft building blocks to create a working 16bit computer !
20348,"and i thought 16bit computers went out of production in the 1980s ! computers have really advanced science in ways that were not ; possible earlier r , great advances in space travel were made possible with computer simulations . and computers are getting smaller . harvard scientist have been able to store an animation nor a galloping horse in the dna of bacteria ! ! !"
20349,"computers re getting smarter nd yet i feel that ther eis so much more room to innovate ! for example smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty , that scares me nd makes me feel like it actually could harm the computer 's system !"
20350,"i 'm not quite sure ho apple will enforce that warranty use a swab test for tobacco combustion rescue ? with scientist and computers , the line between the present and the future is somewhat blurred . did you know scifi author isaac asimov created the term ' robotics ' in 1941 ?"
20351,"i did n't know that ! that must ahve bee before robotics was even thought of very often , whereas now bit 's a huge debate ! although i think the history may go back even further , like i believe edgar allen poe wrote the first known example ; le of robots in fiction ."
20352,"could be ; i have not read poe in ages . in weird science news , did not know its legal to own a rabbit in queensland australia useless you hve a magician 's license or are a scientist ? that sounds like it could be straight out of fiction ! ! !"
20353,"oh absolutely , and i have no clue how they would follow that ! other strange science news i heard about was a very young prodigy , john von neumann could divide 8 digit numbers and converse in ancient greek all by the age of 6 ."
20354,that was truly remarkable age 6 ! . do you know when i completed college ?
20355,"no clue ! i 'm guessing i nwas very early on though , maybe he grew up to eb one of those geniuses that helped build a computer that runs on water !"
20356,"sport about the slip of the fingers , it should have been ' he ' and not ' i ' . i guess some of the more eccentric people can be the most creative and wish the rings guidance produce something tran has real world applicability . well right now , i am thinking about going program my microwave tom the popcorn !"
20357,"no worries ! maybe you 'll be the next great mind but science , who knows ! it was ice chatting with you , have a great night !"
20358,same to you . and do n't self experiment with thee lectrodes to the brain !
20359,"ahah definitely a good idea , thank you for the advice . good night !"
20360,would you be someone that reads much poetry ?
20361,"lol joe since high school but i know a little about it , like the epic of gilgamesh written in sumerian"
20362,that 's more that me . i like to read but i do n't enjoy poetry . nicole cool is a complex unknown to me .
20363,"lol yea back in high school we that to read stuff like the odyssey and iliad , personally i thought the stories were interesting but why top long"
20364,"yes , school was probably my last real interaction it poetry , i recall having to memorize q poe mb wordsworth , hand having to recite it to th endless ."
20365,"that 's sucks . some classes i took would make you write poes which i sucked t . , i ca n't imagine ever writing a 274 line poem with 800 irregularly pronounced words like one poet did"
20366,"i remember being very jarvus about the reputation , i got very hot and the collar . we had to be shirt and ties to school , i distinct remember the feeling ."
20367,"too add for were n't a viking , they though poetry was a gift from odin . they probably would n't make you dress sup for poetry recitafion"
20368,"the vikings were a bit more casual in their dress . i don ' ithink thay were too bothered about basing hte right label on they clothing , no lacoste symbols on their chainmail ."
20369,yea and theyd id n't have to wear blue shirts at funeral like the pallbearers at billy may 's funeral
20370,"i think maybe i 'll write a poem about how i hate recruiting poetry , especially in a shirt and ti ."
20371,if it 's really bad maybe cs lewis will read it at a laugh you lose competitions he has
20372,to be honest i think i would and bad poetry more entertaining than good poetry .
20373,"yea , maybe that should of been an olympic event instead of regular poetry"
20374,"now you mention i do recall the were gold medal for poetry i nthe early days , i think foray rt as well . i just read today tha they want break dancing o b erin th upcoming olympics ."
20375,"break dancing as an olympic event sounds pretty subjective but so was poetry , art , and music"
20376,"i suppose it old be like he ice dancing , a bunch of judges making a evaluation . essentially an election ."
20377,yea but apparently the faster blinker has lost every us presidential election since 1980 so maybe there is an ojbectibe way to judge candidates
20378,i can just see all the upcoming candidates getting blinking coaching to ensure they optimism their blinking for the american public . it seems height plays a roll in elections too .
20379,must be why hank hte cat did n't win in the virginia senate election send only place third
20380,that or there was too much blinking . do cats blink ? i 'd like to see how a cat does in office . amy wood say better than we normally get .
20381,da n't be worse . well it was nice talking with you
20382,are you familiar with association football ? perhaps you know it better as soccer ?
20383,i used to play soccer ! yes . i usually watch the world cup ! what about you ?
20384,i too enjoy watching the fifa world cup every four years
20385,"i 'm not surprised that soccer generates more income than other major sports com , binged . th world loves soccer !"
20386,"personally i was a bit surprised by that fact the i knew soccer wa popular , but it did n't seem as popular . other sports like football in america"
20387,"soccer will never be popular in the us . maybe they need tomb uni da special city , like in qatar . the city set to host the 2022 qatar would cup final does not ye sexist"
20388,"despite its popularity , the us , and team still have n't placed below third place in the world cup"
20389,"the women 's team ? yeah , they 're good . same with japan . much better than the men . do n't know why so many countries ie for the wc . there are no net economic gains fot them ."
20390,i wouldnt ' g say no economic is . their is prestige and bragging rights . i also think there are ways peopple make money off the world cup .
20391,"i think rich countries can take the hit , but brazil ? hey had a stadium in the middle of nowhere . poor countries should put money into infrastructure . it 's great that german soccer player mesut ozil donated his victory bonus to pay for surgeries fo 23 children in brazil ."
20392,"despite making investments in stadiums , would n't brazil make it up with prestige , tourism , and other related sources of revenue ? i understand you point l but i just ma not familiar enough to say ."
20393,"i do n't know . there is an undrerclass in brazil that needs attention , and i think they love watching soccer , but i do n't know if the wealth ever reace4hs theme ."
20394,"i see your point . on another not , did you know there a variation of soccer with 3 teams instead of 2 in af ree for all ? that sounds amazing"
20395,how many referees do tey need ? and are there 11 players on each team ? sounds like confusion .
20396,"i would still live to see it at least once . sound chaotic , but i a goo sway"
20397,i would n't place a bet on a team until i knew more about it . do you listen to the beatles ?
20398,"htey have some amazing shows , despite not being about to read music"
20399,"i do not know how , but hte beatles have the best selling labour of the 2000 's . i thought the kids would be listening to something else ."
20400,i think that th beatles still is a timeless classic . they even had an enormous following resulting in neatlemamnia
20401,i think they were smart to stop touring . the amplification technology could n't keep up with the cleaning . plus boring is really hard on you . away from home for month . seems tough .
20402,"i agree . in any 's , it was wonderful chatting with you about the beatles"
20403,yes ! i enjoyed the chat ! have a go evening !
20404,the same to you .
20405,hey there do you like poetry at all ;
20406,i like poetry . i once sa what feminist poet who did a riff on that lou reed song . someone told me to read alice james
20407,"yeah i 've heard that 's pretty did . i 'll have to check it out . i look want to check out the poem that , when red normally is depressing , but when read backwards is actually a very inspiring things to read"
20408,"thats a neat trick . obviously it wont say ' paul is a ' . speaking goof tricks , i would like to check out trister cfmeinism ."
20409,it does sound interesting . can you believe ethan edgar relaly poe only got like 10 for writing his famous poem the raven . that is a travesty
20410,yeah . mark zuckerberg grey tshirts cost 300400 bucks .
20411,that 's very strange . he 's definitely over paying haha . . i would love to live in hawaii where the famous official business fruit is the aloha shirt
20412,"yeah , in contrast the orbits only considered collared garment s ' shirts '"
20413,haha i actually like that word a lot more than shirt . i also know that you can wear at ie underneath a shirt collar . i do that all the time for real functions . what about you
20414,a tie underneath ac dollar ? thats as strange a a do winning a mayoral election
20415,yep i 'd agree with that . do you know that history of polo shirts ?
20416,well they cant be british since they have no cuffs
20417,haha good point . created by a famous tennis player . so not by polo players at all
20418,interesting . wonder what sells more . . . polo shorts or calvin and hobbes t shirts
20419,that 's a great question . did you know the difference between button up and buttondown shorts ?
20420,one . which one was when at billy mays funeral ?
20421,i 'm not sure actually . but a buttondown shirt is where the collar fasten to thee day of the shirt . a button up shirt does not do that .
20422,h . that tells me something about buttoned up people
20423,did you hear about the popular trend in chain during the cultural revolution ?
20424,i ca n't imagine it was pleasant .
20425,well they would water as much clothing and shirts as they could and pop the collars . i bet that looked really weird haha
20426,"hi , how eyou ?"
20427,it is interesting how so many sports cans nad players believe in cures and luck for whether they win or lose
20428,"yes , will , i guess a lot is inexplicable in sports . the luck factor is one that fans believe they have some influence over ."
20429,yes . i do love how the cub 's curse of the billy goat was finally broken last year .
20430,"the cub 's were like hte red sox . the more they believed in z curse , the more powerful too curse seemed ."
20431,the germans at least admitted to cocky arrogance when they lost to south korea in the world cup rather than blaming it on divine intervention
20432,"the us too 3rd place in the first world cup in 1930 a it 's been downhill ever since . is there a curse ? probably not arrogance , because the sport isn ' tthat popular in the us ."
20433,"that is very true . the european countries have a lot of political stuff going on right now , so they rely in their abilities in soccer to cope sometimes ."
20434,i think that emotion trumps logic and economic gain in these countries . where are no economic gains for the countries tat have played host to the wc .
20435,yes . and many o they countries that do well in the cup like uruguay are nyt exactly superpowers . it is a one like no other .
20436,"yes , tiny countries can dominate . the hungarian national footbal team had one defeat between 1950 and 1956 , and that was the world cup final ."
20437,"yes and in the east 5 tournaments , the defe4ndign champion has been eliminated in the group phase 4 times ."
20438,"tha sport draw sa lot of fans and generates a lot of income . soccer makes more than football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis and hockey combined . i guess the fortune of teams vary quite a bit in that environment ."
20439,yes and some countries have players rom other countries on their teams . plus many of the big champions have gotten round by much miller countries .
20440,i 'm impressed by teh largest of some of the players though . german player mesut ozil donated his world cup bonus to pay for surgeries for 23 children in brazil .
20441,that is awesome ! that was very nice of him . did you know that the city that is going to host the 2022 final does not even exist yet ?
20442,"qatar is rich , so i guess they can put up a city pretty fast , especially wit labor from the subcontinent ."
20443,yes but thay world cup is going to have major problems with that i suspect !
20444,very true . i think the fix ws in when qatar was chosen . money changed hands .
20445,i wonder if the beatles were into soccer ? they are one of my favorite nbabdse very .
20446,"i suppose they were . they were british . they had no choice in the late it well , i enjoyed chatting wit hyou !"
20447,yes it is crazy that they were so popular that they and to stop touring because th current amps could not keep up with the screaming !
20448,"hi , how are you ?"
20449,i 've been writing some poetry tonight did you know writing poetry was once an olympic sport ?
20450,i had no idea . how are you doing ? are you going for the told ?
20451,"i would do great , but probably only in a you laugh you lose competition like cs lewis and tolkien used to play"
20452,are your poems depressing when read forward debut inspiring when read backwards ?
20453,"no , mine are more like the chaos which is 2m lines of hard to pronounce words !"
20454,did you get write the japanese alphabet ?
20455,that is a complicated alphabet but i do not know it
20456,"when recited in order , it does form a poem . hopefully they got more than 9 for it ."
20457,oh interesting i did not know that . i have been busy following who all is going to be running in the next election
20458,really ! i love politics . who do you think will be in the next election ?
20459,i am from texas and 9 love beto o'rourke . i hope he does or president and wins the election i just wish i could vote by mail like they do in oregon
20460,"thati would make life easier ! serious question , did beto ever win a stat reelection ? i know he on to someone but can not remember who and that was national ."
20461,yes he served in the us douse for 6 years . he lost to red cruz for senate this year but just barely .
20462,that 's it . i heard he said he was willing to serve as vp if hue didn ' twin the presidency .
20463,yes he is amazing . i think he woudl even beat the cat named hank who finishes 3rd in a virginia senate election .
20464,nevada is teh only state to have a ' none of the above ' as an option ? w the not just skip it ?
20465,i would like that because him would let me voice my dictate for both candidates . i personally woul probably vote for a dog one served as mayor for 13 years !
20466,"man , that dog lived a long time ! a years as a mayor ! ? ! ? ! ? !"
20467,politics must have suited him ! i wonder if they made him wear a shirt to the office ?
20468,nice chanting with you !
20469,do you like poetry ?
20470,i like poetry but do n't read it sm use as it pick i should . but it 's amazing . poetry can express so much emotion on so many different topics . do you like emit ?
20471,"i liar it yeah , i think that it expressed feelings in a unique way ,"
20472,"i agree . have you ever heard of nicole cooler , aka alice james , ? she ha some great poetry out there . very unique"
20473,"i gave actually , of marriage is one of her popular poem wright ?"
20474,"yes it is . its about he brown experience with her marriage , and it 's really got . it 's really cool with her use of unexpected line breaks"
20475,"yeah being legally an emotionally bound t a person , thats something i can understand , she was w great writting style"
20476,"yeah , and so does elizabeth spices . she rewrote a piece that raises really important questions about identity and memory and death"
20477,"i havent heard about her , i might google that poem layer sounds interesting ,"
20478,it definitely is . and anne walkman wrote a collection called ' trister feminist ' about feminist and the people who want to take women down
20479,"i thought that one was great , she won a award becaue of the poem might ? i heard he is an award winning activist"
20480,yeah i think she is . she wrote a great piece about the 2016 election . do you know anything about elections ?
20481,"yeah a bit , the taller candidate seems to win most of the times , interestin stat"
20482,sad that 's so weird . maybe that 's why trum won the election in 2016 . did you know that voter turnout has been less than 2 or 3 's of the population for the ; ago hundred years ?
20483,"wow i agree with you that can be the reason , nevada has a none of these candidates option"
20484,"i wonder why that is . if you do n't like easy og the candidates , then why do you go to vote ?"
20485,"i know right , just stay at home an avoid voting g , it would be funny if that option won though"
20486,"yeah , that would be so strange . do you ; like fashion at all ? i think it 's pretty interesting but i ' otto hat informed . i know that in china , gangs would layer as many shirts as possible and pop their collars during the cultural revolution as a fashion statement ."
20487,"i do like fashion , nd that is interesting , do you like to wear polo shirts ?"
20488,"i do n't think i 've ever worn a polo shirt . but did you know that originally polo shirts were invented for tennis players , a nd only later were they worn by actual polo players ?"
20489,"i didnt know that , all that lime wearing polo shirts and i just found out bout that , great fact , thanks ."
20490,"hi , how are you ' are you a soccer fan at all ?"
20491,"yes , i am . do you know that soccer players u an average of 7 miles in a game ."
20492,"yeah i 've heard it was something crazy like that , do you root for a team in the world cup ?"
20493,usually england . how about yourself ?
20494,england ? look ! i root for the u . s . men 's team when they actually the it . it has n't been a good run for men 's squad recently .
20495,i am a proud american so of course i roof for the u . s . men 's team but when they get knocked out i switch to england .
20496,"ah i have . i 'm with you . i rooted for england last world cup actually too a t least the . . s . women 's tema is awesome , e h ?"
20497,"yeah , they lure are awesome . can you believe the super bowl is smaller than soccer 's third biggest event ?"
20498,"it 's hard to live , but soccer makes more money tha football , basketball , baseball and hockey combined so it makes sense . only the us and canada care bout footbal really . the best of the world loves soccer ."
20499,"i love watching soccer bt he anticipation when the ball is getting close to the goal and hoping , or reading , that a goal might b becoming"
20500,me too . i think soccer and hockey are the best two sports . watch . the action and movement is constant . i wonder if the 2022 world cup will still be in qatar .
20501,i do n't know . the awarding process s so corrupt . i think they have a ways to go on the infrastructure . i heard they are trying to make a fair condition stadium that are solar powered .
20502,yea apparently there have been huge human violent rights and labor rights violations where they are building for the world cup in qatar . i though the might have changed the venue .
20503,they shouldnt ' shave got it int he first once . it is too hot there for starters . soccer 9s definitely the world 's most popular sport . did you that over 46 percent of the world population watched the 2010 fifa world cup ?
20504,"that 's insane , billions of people . it 's weird qatar is building so much when there are n't really any net economic gain for hosting the world cup . weird ."
20505,same things for the olympic . some of the old olympics sites are declaring ghost towns
20506,i just saw the old site in barcelona last year . they actually turned it into something decent . a bunch of restaurants off e beach and a boardwalk .
20507,"that is awesome . i saw a sideshow recently about a few of the abandoned olympic sites . there was one in russia , on an eastern europe and perhaps one in canada , very sad"
20508,"interesting , who the one in russia he recent one ?"
20509,"ye s , i think it sas socks , spelling ? ,"
20510,"yes , where germany gt knocked rut of by the south koreans lol . i believe france wo n ."
20511,i think you re right . o you think the u s men team will get better in the near future ?
20512,i hope so . i kind of agree when p ; people say that the best athletes in the us do n't play soccer . very 's not enough money in it here .
20513,good point . hey it was nice talking with you
20514,"thank s , you too ."
20515,bye
20516,many people think it was a good thing that trump did n't attend barbara mush 's funeral
20517,"hes th president , he wanted to golf instead . i pretty musc scan do whatever he wants lol did you know the president guest house is bigger than the white house ?"
20518,"i guess the actual white house is more for politics rather than housing guests . still , i do n't get the whole obsession with gold . babe rut h , on the other and , is the country 's most famous golfer"
20519,as really interesting tht an average american golf course consumes 312 69 00 gallons of water per day !
20520,"well , considering that land is larger than both delaware and rhode island together , that 's not surprising"
20521,"thats all the courses combined thoug . na average gold course consumes 312 , 000 gallons ad ay , ties that by how many courses ar en america !"
20522,"which still seems like nothing compared to the golf course that requires 4 , 000 , 000 gallons a day . that course is in dubai"
20523,"right , that is a lot just for a lot course ."
20524,people love their gold . it 's even ins samuel lbj jackson 's film contracts that he ah play golf twice a week while in production for movies
20525,that must be nice ! choosing your schedule where you can golf twice a week . i would go snowboarding lol
20526,everyone has their preferences . apparently most people prefer listening to songs in major keys because kanye 's song gold digger is the only minor key sony in the ten most successful songs of all time
20527,"i honestly dont find any of his songs good and i think his personality , at least what she puts out there , is really annoying . i think its weir that he believes that aids is a man made disease ."
20528,"i 'm not sure what he even mens by manmade . he ha his god sides though because during own of his concerts , he gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair"
20529,"man made , like this disease was made in a lab and green to the public . remember when he took over taylor swifts award speech and granted on about something during her time on camera ."
20530,"what 's funny is that two years before that incident , h redid w snl skit skit mocking himself doing taht exact thing"
20531,that is pretty ironic . maybe it was planned ol
20532,"probably ot . still , he 's had an influence on music and eve cultural movement sat a large level ."
20533,i know people keep saying that lol how is he an influenced on music ? what makes people say hes contributed to these cultural movements ?
20534,"he 's made changes in styles , and in addition , new 's a record producer . kanye signed big sean , who had a 3 . 7 gpa nd had a scholarship he turned down to pursue music"
20535,"that doesnt seem like a hug influence in music though , people sign up artist all the time on their musi labels ."
20536,he 's incorporated a lot of different genres in developing hip hop
20537,do you know much about politics ?
20538,i know some stuff . republican presidents seem to have a beard
20539,nice . th 'president has either been a republican or a democrat since 1853
20540,yeah i guess we do not hear of other parties much
20541,true . do you know who thy started using the red and blue colors ?
20542,"yes that was pretty recent , in 2000s"
20543,yeah it though it was something that was always the made to be honest
20544,me too . did you know truman refused o be photographed in the dumbo ride ?
20545,yes he did not want to eb associated with the republicans
20546,yeah that was pretty extreme though if you ask e
20547,true . do you know what is the other nba for the republican party ?
20548,"yes it is know as gop , grand old party"
20549,yea . do you like kanye west ?
20550,somewhat . he has one o 'the most successful songs anough
20551,yes that is the gold digger song which is i minor key
20552,yeah . we believes that aids is a man made disease
20553,wow . but on the other hand he once gave his mic to a fan on a wheelchair
20554,that i since of him . did you know he has big sean signed under his label ?
20555,yes and he was a great student . university before that
20556,yup . it was nice chatting with you
20557,same here
20558,"i think trump should 've have paid him respects to bush by going to his funeral ever if he id not know him or never met him , what do you think ?"
20559,i think that it wa sa good idea for him not to show up .
20560,how com ?
20561,he might not have felt he belonged .
20562,i see . i think melania trump was captured in the photo that represented power .
20563,"melania trump is an appropriate representation at a funeral , i worry her husband would no shave had as much decor ."
20564,"haha , that is tru . i did not know that ther republican party was also referred to as the grand old party or gop"
20565,"i did n't always agree with george bush od barack obama on policy , but i think they represented the office of the president admirable ."
20566,"i 100 percent agree with you on that . trump seems to care about nothing , even when he ' w presented with reasonable compromised on uses , he prefers to leave them as problems as opposed to answering his supporters ."
20567,"i 'm glad he played golf at maralago instead of attending the funeral . the less 8 see of him , the better ."
20568,"haha , speaking of golf , did you know that the average golf course consume around 312000 gallons of water per day ? !"
20569,that 's such w waste .
20570,"it relaly is a waste , especially the golf course in dubai that needs 4 , 000 , 000 gallons of water a day !"
20571,do you think trump should build a wall along the mexican border ?
20572,"no , to me it 's a waste of resources . what do you think ?"
20573,"i 'm surprised he reopen the government , it really upset his base of supporters that want the wall built ."
20574,"according to the news , it seems like the shutdown cost the us more money than what he was asking for to build the wall ."
20575,i disagree with most of trump 's policies .
20576,i just cant ' believe there are so many people who idolize him or t least support him to lead hte country . i think kanye west is trump 's supporter .
20577,i think it 's time for an independent candidate to get elected as president . do n't think we 've had one since the 1800 's .
20578,"well , there was talk oh the news that howard schulz would be running as an independent candidate for the next election . i thin , 'd support him if her an for office ."
20579,i think i would hate for him too .
20580,did you see any of te ' incredibles ' movies ?
20581,"i did , i saw both actually , i like the director brad bird he does a good job , what bout you ?"
20582,"i like them both , but it wax a long time between the first and th second ."
20583,"ya it was , i liked him jackson 's role in that paying frozono though"
20584,"well , he is good in anything so he was good in both of them . they could n't keep the kids though because of the long time between them ."
20585,"right that makes sense , i remember in the first movie , they had to develop a bunch lof new technology to make that movie possible for the hair , skin , and clothes"
20586,there was 14 years between them m so of course things changed . the first one was bad on a video game that was 13 years before the first .
20587,"ah that is interesting , what do you think of domino masks ? those are the masks all the incredibles wear ?"
20588,"i guess most superheros and superheroine wear those , but it was good oh ave some females , and a nice depiction f far , my life ."
20589,"ya i think so , do you like any other superheros ? there is a book coming out o actually becoming a real lie batman haha"
20590,"i think ' normalman ' is the funniest one , he i on a planet of superheroes , and is the only one without a power ."
20591,"haha that is a good concept , did you hear about pet force btw ?"
20592,"well , there are over 300 registered superheroes in the us , is that one of them ?"
20593,"haha i do n't know k but pet force is a garfield spinoff and jist has garfield and his friends as superheroes , sounds coo it me !"
20594,is it a movie ? if so who made it ? i know disney and pixar have done some of the recent superhero animations .
20595,"ya i think it was just a coin , but i would gavel ged am movie ! kind of crazy tan lee was going o change careers initially , good thing he didnt !"
20596,9 am glad he created marvel ! what was his other possible career ?
20597,"i 'm not sure , but he didn ' r switch when he was finally given creative control for making his own superhero characters like the hulk , obviously important haah"
20598,is the hulk a superhero or a supervillain ? superheroes cant e so destructive that they made a series about the drama remade by superheroes and how to fix it .
20599,"haha that is funny , but makes a good point , and ya i do n't know he could probably be both , did you ever have a few has a kid"
20600,"i never had a pet fish , but i have eaten some of the gill bearing aquatic animals for dinner r ."
20601,"haha yes i had salmon tonight myself , i guess the oldest goldfish ever was 43 years old !"
20602,jellyfish though take the prize for age . there is one be though to be immortal .
20603,"ya you 're right , theyre also 98 percent water o they can easily evaporate unfortunately"
20604,"being immortal is good and all , but you can still die other ways . i 'm not sure what jellyfish are actual fish though ."
20605,"no i do n't think so , but there is a weird fish , it lives o land all of it 's life , very strange !"
20606,"hey there , do you like movies ?"
20607,i do . i really enjoy superhero movies and comics
20608,nice . have you seen the incredibles movies ?
20609,i 've only seen the first one . i have n't seen te 2018 incredibles 2 yes .
20610,"nice , me either but the first one was fun to watch . do you know who was the voice of edna mode"
20611,"yes , it 's actually a guy ! brad bird ."
20612,i still wonder how they were not able to find a woman to lay it
20613,i assume he had something very specific in mind fort he character . he seems very eccentric as a director .
20614,"true , he only hired people that he thought would quit or be fired from pixar ."
20615,"i it n't understand the intention behind that . but it is definitely interesting . superhero writer more known for weird things though . there is , for instance , a superhero called normalman"
20616,haha what is this superhero 's superpower ?
20617,he has none ! he 's the only man on a superhero planet without power s .
20618,oh okay i guess that is why the name . i wonder if anyone stinks about he collateral damage superheroes cause ?
20619,actually yes . there 's also a comic about that .
20620,"nice , i wonder what teh estimate is here in damages . are least they save us ."
20621,ahha that is true . there are over 100 registered us superheros so hero is a lot of damage to recover from
20622,yup . stand lee alien maybe created more thank all of them
20623,possibly . he wrote 15 dc comics too !
20624,"the man was a legend . there is refine a garfield book called pet force , wher garfield and his gang are superheroes !"
20625,he is definitely much missed in the comic world ; he was a super hero himself in a way
20626,that is so true . it was nice chatting with you
20627,are you a superhero fan ?
20628,"i was once , but threw world turned against me . now , ia m a superhero fan incognito . , . you ?"
20629,"i like them , but i am not into all the lore and everythings ."
20630,are you a fan of the best animated movie of 2016 ?
20631,which one is that ?
20632,"why , incredibles 2 of course !"
20633,i havent seen it . i am living turner a rock . it has even a long time since the first one i feel .
20634,"yeah , that first one came out in 2004 . that 's a long time between installment , especially for such a successful first film !"
20635,i think the was a video game in the mean tim .
20636,"tru e , but this is the first fulllength film since the origianl ! he director , brad bird postpohned the development of the sequel film to work on the projects ."
20637,"hopefully it can really live up to the hype . bird also voice a character in the film , edna mode ."
20638,"he sure did ! the film was gotten shih praise for its animation , force acting , humor , action sequences , and musical score . my one of those makes the sequel a food bet for a great time !"
20639,"yeah , i hear michael giacchino was back to score again ."
20640,"yup , and i just love the work of holly hunter and craig t nelson too !"
20641,they are pretty incredible . no pun intended .
20642,did you know that there was a comic series written about cleaning up collateral damage caused by superheroes ? pretty creative !
20643,"i bet that would be fun to read , that is one thing super heroes always do , destroy everything , all in the name of saving the planet ."
20644,my favorite superhero fish is the black swallower ! 9th superpower is that it can swallow up to 10 times it shown weight !
20645,that is awesome ! i am a bit fan of deadpool !
20646,"i am unfamiliar wit that character . is it a fish too ? my son favorite fish superhero is the seahorse . . . as the only fish wit a neck , it stands out from the rest !"
20647,"nope , he is must a regular superhero who is extremely sarcastic . but i 'd be that jellyfish that is i , mortal . that sounds cool !"

20652,"well , thanks ! did anything seem interesting fin your article ?"
20653,i 'm astonished that einstein was good at music . he played two instruments .
20654,that 's impressive . you usually do n't see a math 04 science guy with a music side . niche combo .
20655,he probably could have gone pro if it had n't been for that pesky science career .
20656,i 'm glad he ended up o his feet . this science career might work out for him if he really tries . . .
20657,i 'm also surprised that modern violins are preferred tv the old expensive ones . i wonder what the difference is . better materials ?
20658,i thought the old ones were relaly expensive . maybe just the stravariou'ss . i know those go for millions !
20659,"i wonder if they are easier o play . i want to listen to the piece hat haydn wrote , where the musicians gradually leave the stage ."
20660,were they going on strike ? i 200 2 creed concert wa she bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band . that 's got ta be a bad show !
20661,"i guess creed must 've been high or out of practice . i 've been to bad concerts , but i revert thought about suing ."
20662,i remember this and the laid on teh stage for like 1 hour silent an then called it artist interpretation . . .
20663,"yeas , that 's exactly what the audience paid for . the ramones knows how to do i . over 2000 concerts ? i wonder when they slept ."
20664,after the curious amount of drugs and alcohol ore off . they were crazy ! i woul be afraid to got to their shows an i 'm 6 ' 6 ' a nd 250 pounds !
20665,they could have hired you as a stage bounce . just leather up and grease your hair back . people would respect you . what about linkin park ? game you seen them ?
20666,"except if someone with a napoleon complex tries me , i would bet eh worst younger in the world . trust me , drunk short people tried me all the time in my younger days ."
20667,"ok , even you could see pink floyd when they play pompeii . no risk there ."
20668,at least there would n't be idiots yelling out money ! ! !
20669,maybe it 's the same idiots at every concert yelling mutt he same stuff . whipping post !
20670,nice chatting wit hyou !
20671,hi do you like going to concerts or watching them online ?
20672,"yes i love concert ! i saw l ; linkin park a lot , b t i did not see them 324 times in a year lol thats how many times thee toured back in 2001"

20674,"yes i did , they ton are a lot too ! they did over 2000 concerts in only 20 years"
20675,"wow . that 's a lot of touring . in croatia a , there is still an ancient roman amphitheatre that is still used for concerts . that would be s neat place to see a show in ."

20682,"that is cool , it 's funny to that in australia there is a mall that will play classical music to scare teenagers away lol that way they do n't lobster"
20683,that 's funny ! lol there 's a man named arthur lintgen and he can correctly identify a piece of classical music by analyzing the grooves on a vinyl record . that 's pretty incredible !
20684,"that is definitely a talent ! and like i mentioned , apparently a city will also use classical music to deter crime , that 's what they should have used instead of robocop lol"

20695,"no , what was the same of the tour and i do n't know them very much , they seems as popular as abba ."
20696,i 've never heard of abba . who is that ?
20697,"they are a swedish band , very popular in the disco er a , they recently turned down a 1 billion offer for unite . i guess they do n't like each other anymore ."
20698,"i 've never heard of them . interesting , did you know that the ramones played 2 , 23 concerts ?"
20699,"that is a lot , in how many yeas they did this ?"
20700,it took them about 20 years .
20701,"that is and 10 concerts per year , it is a lot but it is doable . i hope hey do n't play as loud a deep purple ."
20702,do they play really loud ?
20703,"they ahve the world record for the loudest concert , 3 people in the crowd lost consciousness because it was too loud . the foo fighters also give loud concert ."
20704,interesting . i did n't know that . did they get in trouble ? i 've sen the foo fighters .
20705,"one foo fighters did not get in troubles , but they gave a concert so loud that it showed o seismic , monitors ."

20708,"yeah , i saw them and i 've seen dave grohl play with queens o 'the stoned age also ."

20710,"yeah , it was actually pretty good . i 'm a big fan . well , nice chatting with you ."
20711,"you too , i wish our plenty of concerts . maybe you you try classical music , studies ahve shown had people who like heavy metal and people who like classical have similar tastes ."

20715,"yes . . . he had an amazing voice ; . . did you hear that due to he success of their debut album , linkin park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone ?"
20716,"i did , thats amazing ! the ramones played a total of 2 , 263 concerts . . . they toured limos ton stop fdr over 20 years . that just be tiring ! and fun !"

20718,"in croatia , there is an ancient roman amphitheatre that is still in use as a concert venue"
20719,"wow , that 's something i would like to see . and during the concert i wonder what sound acoustic does test place have : ,"
20720,probably amazing ! in 2002 a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band
20721,"bad meaning tone performance ? or , maybe too loud or somehting ?"
20722,"coul dean a lot of things , the fact down n't go into a much detail ."
20723,"in 1972 , pink floyd recorded a live concert at the ancient roman amphitheater pink pompeii . . . with no audience did you see the did ? i loved it ; ,"
20724,"no i did n't . good to know though ! classical music concerts hd loud , moving , wild audiences during teh performance ."
20725,"the one in pompeii as quite psyhcodelical : , not everybody like something like that ; ,"
20726,haah that would be trippy . a man name arthur lintgen scan correctly identify a piece of classical music by simply analyzing the grooves on a vinyl record .
20727,"sounds like a scam ; , sure , that 's one of those things i would have to see to believe : ,"
20728,"maybe , i would n't know if he az lying or not though , because i know nothing about classical music lol a shopping center in australia is using classical music go stop teenagers from loitering"
20729,"ok is the heck does that work ? teenagers do n't like this music , ut it 's nor scary or anything like that : ,"
20730,maybe they got that frequency in it that makes humans feel fear
20731,"or maybe they hit that mystique tone the makes all humans poop ; , lol"
20732,"oh need , i feel bad for those teenagers ! in 2011 a computer composed a piece of contemporary classical music ."
20733,i do n't believe a machine can create basic on a decent quality level . . .
20734,maybe .
20735,"alright , i as great chatting with you !"
20736,you too !
20737,"have a great night ; ,"
20738,help ! did you know that months before apollo 11 nasa had seriously considered placing a un instead of an american flag on the moon ?
20739,"good morning ! jo , i did not know that ! very interesting ."
20740,i did n't either ! the highest point on the moon is 1938 meter higher than mt . everest ! looks like we 'll eb learning of new things about the moon today . lol
20741,i wonder if anyone has been tot heat op ? do you know wht the average age was of mission control during the first moon landing ?
20742,i doubt it ! lol . . . and i have no idea .
20743,the average age was 28 . even back then i bet that generation was n't getting the credit they deserved !
20744,"lol u bet no is phobos , which is the largest moon around mars is one third hollow !"
20745,"oh , that is weird . surprising ; y there is an asteroid girl its own moon in our solar system ."
20746,"that sounds creepy . there is evidence of methane based life on titan , a moon of saturn ."
20747,"that 's even creepier ! strange moon rock fact , astronauts from apollo 11 had to declare moon rocks through customs upon return to earth !"
20748,not that 's funny ! how ridiculous though they make them do that . do you like birds ?
20749,"yes , i love birds . if and them all the time . odd that birds have regional accents ."
20750,i did n't know tha . that 's pretty interesting !
20751,"well , if you like interesting bird facts , here 's another : pigeons are one of 3 birds that produce milk for their young ! so , what about yo , do you like birds ?"
20752,was ! i did n't know that . yes i do . i have z pigeon back . . . . the extinct dodo bird is actually a subfamily of pigeon .
20753,"oh , that is interesting . did you know that crows are among the most intelligent of birds ?"
20754,that i 've heard before . i find it amazing that some birds can migrate from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping .
20755,that 's amazing . it would be interesting to hear crows imitate human speech since they are capable of doing so .
20756,"that woulda e neat ! i wonder why people do n't like crows ? in most birds , their bones are so cool , ow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers !"
20757,that would make sense since they can fly . they would n't be able to be too heavy .
20758,yes ! wish i was like that so i could fly ! ll it 's been nice chatting with !
20759,"yes , it 's been nice chatting with you as well . have a good day ."
20760,hey there do you like the moon ? i like looking outside right now and seeing it because it 's so pretty
20761,it is pretty incredible . the highest point on the moon is 1938 m higher take mt everest !
20762,that is amazing ! i ' must shocked they were going to put a for the un instead of the american way on the moon initially
20763,i know . it would kinda defeat th point of the space race .
20764,"yep i agree with you . id you know that moon dust is actually very powerful and harmful to humans , it could even cut through kevlar"
20765,"wow . i am suprised they have tried to use it to make something stronger than kevlar then , but if humans couldnt touchy it it would do us little good ."
20766,yep that 's true . what do you think about saturn 's moon ? it 's called titan and there may be evidence that there i like on there actually
20767,"i think that is awesome , although it is methane based love , and other life in the universe could be an amazing thing ."
20768,i still thnk it would be interesting to find life in outer space lol . what do you think about birds by teh way ? i love that they are delicious like the chicken at just ate
20769,birds are tasty . lol i think it is neat that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to fix their nests . .
20770,"i think so , i wonder how the birds of australia can mimic certain sounds . like they can sound like ac camera or a car alarm lol that 's crazy"
20771,neat would be funny to hear . a bird sounding just like a car alarm .
20772,yeah or even a chainsaw lol that would scare me lol
20773,"for real , imagine that flying at you . id be running . lol"
20774,on a different topic what do you think about youtube ? i use youtube almost everyday
20775,i use it so much ! i even use it as a teaching tool !
20776,that 's cool what kind of teaching ? it 's crazy that it was started by only a couple of people back in 200 rand then sod to google in 2006 for at 1 . 65 billion dollars
20777,"general music . so many great video , the kids love the huge its made videos ."
20778,oh that makes sense l what is crazy is that youtube is the second largest search engine on the interent and youtube and netflix together make up half of all internet traffic
20779,id believe it . gangnam style got so many views they had to update the view counter .
20780,"lol you 're right about that , i remember when everyones is watching that , what do you think about the police version of youtube called bluetube ?"
20781,do you us youtube ?
20782,. i do . it is the second largest search engine on the net
20783,weird how i never thought of youtube as a search engine like google 04 bing
20784,it is actually a subsidiary of google ! maybe that is why . it was purchased in 2006 for 1 . 65 billion
20785,youtube was purchased by google ?
20786,yes ot was . and was actually created by 3 former paypal employees
20787,that is cool . i never new that
20788,netflix and youtube make up half of peak internet traffic . that a lot of eyes !
20789,i would n't be surprised
20790,gangnam style got so many views they had to change the view counter
20791,an dustin biebers ' baby is the most hated
20792,it was recently surpassed by youtubes own video this passed year . peopel must ahve really hated it to dislike it more than baby !
20793,did you know the police their own youtube called blutube ?
20794,i did not . here really should be a space one . i would the to see more things about the moon
20795,did you know moon dust is harmful to humans ?

20797,and causes moon hay fever
20798,"i wonder what has more epic views . mt everest , or the highest point on the moon"
20799,i think both would be mind blowing
20800,our moon is the fifth largest in the solar system . ho wool
20801,did you know nasa considered putting a un flag instead of the american one on the moon ?
20802,have a great day !

20829,"dang , i wonder if it will be worth it in the end of er eyou into the gagnam style craze years back ?"

20839,"i used to play piano , but i am not too good anymore . it may be like riding a bike but do n't have the time anymore ."
20840,"well , i sometimes listen to electric violins in rock music or jazz fusion ."

20850,"wow , that is a lot of internet traffic ! worn you ever into the gangnam style phase ?"
20851,"eh , not really . i maybe watched it once ."
20852,"yea me too , i had to dance in front of everyone at a wedding , it was not my proud moment in my life . apparently that song almost broke youtube"
20853,i wonder if it has more likes than justin beiber 's baby has dislikes .
20854,"not quite , i heard tha ties the word liken song ever on youtube , i agree ! ol"
20855,some here . it is pretty bad !
20856,for some lol ! it you know police have their own youtube or their job called blutube .
20857,i hard that . i guess htey post training videos there . pretty cool .
20858,that is cool . do you watch bird videos on youtube at all . i like birds
20859,my favorite bird is the dodo bird !
20860,"that bird was awesome , sad it is extinct now . i think pigeons are related somehow"
20861,that would explain a lo ? did you hear about those wild bird sin alaska
20862,"i did , do n't they migrate to mexico or something ?"
20863,"yeah , they so it without sleeping too ! pretty crazy"
20864,no way ! i ca n't drive an hour without wanting to sleep lol . it was so nice chatting with you !
20865,same here ! great chat ! have a nice day !
20866,"you too , enjoy your day !"
20867,"hi , how are you doing on this peaceful evening on the internet ?"
20868,"hello , just wonder if i can sing like the 7 year old girl who was brave enough to sing the national anthem af teh mls game , can you sing ?"
20869,"i sing so bad that i have been banned by local gov't from doing it . i think if i sang at wen mlb gram e , the umpire would eject me ."
20870,"lol , i kow how you feel but that does n't stop me from singing privately ! even with terrible voices , peole are still brave enough to post themselves singing on youtube , i guess nothing will stop them from wanting to be superstars l"
20871,"it would not take me money , but take me a laughingstock . i will restrict my singing to the shower . kudos to the little girl for her braver though ."
20872,"yea i agree , side yu know that youtube is the second largest search engine on the internet ? ! come to thin of it , i think that 's how justin bieber was discovered , i wonder what people search for on there ."
20873,"people are looking for video sofa themselves singing , no doubt . bieber has the most disliked vid on there . does he care ? no ."
20874,"i kno wi 'm guilty of being are of those contributor to peak internet traffic for netflix and youtube . speaking of , the police have their own youtube called blutube where they share law enforcement videos , is that legal ?"
20875,i 'm sure it is .
20876,"oh ok , i think i prefer to watch videos of piano performances since its much more dramatic . bbc kevin decided that since there were no news forth reporting , htey just went ahead and played piano music instead . i think some news channels should do that when they run out of quality material to report ."
20877,the fox news report trend into a piano recitals . maybe fox woul douse liberals .
20878,maybe . do you play any instruments ?
20879,"no , i do n't . i d like the piano and violin ."
20880,"me too , i did n't know the violin was als called a fiddle , it 's even made from wood , too expensive do you think they are ?"
20881,"i woud guess quite expensive , depending on the age . i think kids rent them because of hte cost . ;"
20882,"oh ok , that seem sa bit more logical since kids may not continue playing karate they realize it actually requires a lot of effort into learning how to play an instrument unless you 're lambert einstein who was also a musical genius az well"
20883,einstein was an artist . i think drawing on both sides of the brain is important . i respect him . he probably was n't as funny as larry fine tough .
20884,"i 'm not familiar with larry fine , was a a comedian and is that a stage name ?"
20885,"he was in the three stooges . he played the violin quite well . he was a comedy genius , buy not so good at science ."
20886,"oh ok , tha makes notre sense now . i do n't think electric violins are as popular as the traditional violins , which one do you like more ?"
20887,"traditional one seem appropriate for most settings . i guess if you 're playing heavy metal , you need amplification ."
20888,i also like the traditional violins as well though i am curious to hear what the violin made solely out of stone that is fully playable sounds likd .
20889,hey there ! 've even browsing youtube all ay . so bored ! h ow about you ?

20897,"i did not , but that sounds interesting . i like space because there 's so much we do n't know about it . i guess methane was just discovered on saturn 's moon , though !"
20898,"yea , i hope we are able to discover life owned ay on one of saturn 's moons"
20899,"me todo . flying all the way up there , even with a satellite , is incredible expensive and timeconsuming ."
20900,add dangerous too . the dust on earth 's moon can cut through kevlarlike material and cause moon ay fever
20901,oh n ! had no idea about that . maybe one day we 'll discover some more cool things about space !
20902,"ye a , i 'd love to fin dogs more about phobos , it is on third hollow , very stange for a moon"
20903,"funny that you mention hollow , because i just read a fact the other day that said that virus ' bones are so hollow that their entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers . . ."
20904,"birds are such cool animals , especially hummingbirds , they steal spider webs for their nests"
20905,i think it 's especially intresting to read about migrating birds .
20906,"yea , there are some birds tthat fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping"
20907,"aviation has always been so fascinating to me . between birds , outer space , and planes , my mind is always blown !"
20908,yea i love learning about birds a how htey evolved from dinosaurs
20909,which is why youtube ! so useful at times !
20910,"sometimes . well it was nice talking with you , have a good day"
20911,do you know who alex emma tjandrawidjaja biz ?
20912,no i dont . who is she ? what does she do ?
20913,she a 7 year old little girl who sang the national anthem at a mls game and apparently she did marvelous .
20914,"oh , thats great q 7 years old . that is quite young . i guess she has a grea career ahead of her ."
20915,she bummed hte first line to herself an then let loose . allan t that you1 age in front of such a large crowd . that 's remadkalbe .
20916,i would have been terrified . how did she get chosen ? what else ha she doesn ?
20917,well that performance in particular went viral !
20918,she must be planning her next perforakmne . i bet she could go on the road during teh summer and perform at mlb games .
20919,i bet when she was only three she performed in a talent show at ; a live in downtown los angeles .
20920,this kid must be phenomenal . does she also dance and act ? she could be huge .
20921,i'n oy sure but by the time she was 5 she played at carnegie hall .
20922,"i guess she plays the piano , or the violin ? or both ?"
20923,"woudl n't surprise me she going to be a prodigy . hey ' v given her an it name of comic spitfire did say she stole heart right and left , wonderful ."
20924,"speaking of pianos , did you know that freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude ? i would this girl to have a chance to use that piano ."
20925,yeah that would be pretty cool ! emma based her singing style on christine aguilar .
20926,"that is a great role model . 8 think the kid hoax a bright future . by the way , id you know that there is a violin made out of stone that ios fully playable ?"
20927,"how i wonder if the sound is somewhat differnt , do you know ? you can proabably find out on youtube ."
20928,i bet it ' rock s ' pretty hard q lol . an aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship hindenburg . i wonder how it sounded . tinny ?
20929,i as concerned about the added weight but im pretty the it was calculated in .
20930,"yes , it did not weigh much . i hope that it sounded good enough . what about the piano found on top of britain 's highest mountain ?"
20931,i heard about hat apparently it 's a mystery as to how or who pu tit there . do you watch netflix ?
20932,"i used to watch netflix . i dont now . great shows , very convenient , very addictive . lo . namely , great chat !"
20933,you too ! netflix rand youtube the up half of peak tim internet traffic on the web .
20934,"yes , everybody loves their video entertainment !"
20935,"right , have a great day my friend ! parting note police have their own channel called blutube ."
20936,good morning !
20937,good morning ! i can still see the moon outside how bailout you ?
20938,unfortuantely i ca n't see it today due to the clouds . it ' lovely though ! it 's the fifth largest natural satellite in our solar system !
20939,that 's amzing . th dust on hte moon is said to be able to cut through kevlar !
20940,not i did n't know that . i need to watch some more youtube univerity lol . youtube is the second largest search engine on the internet ! its ' got everything !
20941,it really does ! netflix and youtube together make up half of peak internet traffic in north america . safe to say it 's not going anywhere anytime soon .
20942,even the police have their own youtube blutube ! m media uses it as well like bbc . it 's crazy
20943,8 is . did you know gangnam style got so many are that they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits ?
20944,i knew animal videos were super popular on there but i did n't know that . people love bird videos . especially those where the birds sounded like other things like car alarms . the wild birds in australia can mimic all kinda of car nooses and alarms 21
20945,i 've heard that . i would ' imagine those living around here . i also have a hard time fa5homing stat the dodo bird is a subfamily of pigeon .
20946,that is weird . a neat thing though is hummingbirds use spiderwebs to repair and build nets !
20947,that 's possibly the most adorable thing i 'll cheer all day . they are so tiny and cute . it 's crazy to thin about the fact that their zones arie so hollow their entire skeleton weighs les than their feather s .
20948,so fragile ! it 's interesting when you think abou throw their digestive and respiratory systems are unique adapted just so they can fly !
20949,"absolutely . fragile but strong too , some birds can fly from alaska to mexico without sleep when migrating ."
20950,that 's more than i can do . the only bird without know wings re the moa and elephant birds but booty are extinct .
20951,that 's crazy ! it 's also crazy how closely birds descended from dinosaurs and dramatically diversified around 66 million years ago .
20952,it is ! and they evolved wings depending on the need for them . whether its flight ours swimming .
20953,their social monogamy is very interesting as well . most just mate for one season but the species that mate for life are the most interesting .
20954,like some penguins and i believe so was . it 's amazin gf some able penguins will also be i charge of keeping an eye over their eggs while theft females go ot and hunt .
20955,i know . so cool . it sucks that our activity on this planet threatens so many species with extinction . around 1200 bird species .
20956,like the epic mac ana the alagoas foliagegleaner from brazil . . . they arent confirmed for sure gone yet but researchers are pretty certain .
20957,are you a fan of soccer ?
20958,"i watches soccer , but i am trying to understand the entire game , only thing i know is when q team score ."
20959,"me too , lol . i learn a lot more during this last world cup , did you watch that at all ?"
20960,"i watched a few games , but not enough to understand what was going on . i was with friends ad cheer when at ha score ."
20961,"me too , i was all about brazil this lat world cup since th as was n't in it again"
20962,"i see that they are one of the better teams , i wonder why the scores are so 's ? it 's hard to see ."
20963,i think everyone is just super good that it is hard to score lol . do you know most ozil ?
20964,"no i do n't think i do , that bad when i do n't know any of the team members ."
20965,i just know him because he donated his world cup winnings to pay of kids in brazil 's surgeries
20966,"wow , that was thoughtful of him , it would be nice if more wealthy people donate to different causes ."
20967,for sure . soccer makes ore money thank ll the other sports combined . i think they get more money because of this .
20968,"yes you are right , did you know the american team never came in lower than third place since 1991 , i a referring to the women team ?"
20969,"yea , the man ot so hot . i think the men got 3rd place in the world cup once , i 1930 !"
20970,"did york now american used the name soccer , because i is slang for association football ."
20971,i always knew it as soccer so that makes sense . i never knew t was called association football to be honest
20972,do you like to wear boots or you prefer shoes ?
20973,"shoes for sure , but i like a good winter boot . i ended them so much his year from this winter , you ?"
20974,"yes , i bought two pairs , did you know ugg boots were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after leaving the cold water ?"
20975,"i never knew tha , 9 could totally see it ! it was so nice chatting with you !"
20976,"jon stewart nwas a skilled soccer player in college . you have s good night also , nice chatting with you ."
20977,i would never have guessed that ! enjoy your night !
20978,hello how are ou doin today ?

20981,never really followed it . i like american football though .
20982,did you kno wthe city set to host the 2022 qatar world cup does not exist yet ?
20983,they have a lot of work to be getting done then huh .
20984,yes theyd o . the hungary national football team only phd one defeat in 6 years and taht was in the world cup final .
20985,that would be heartbreaking . to win a year lou and then lose in the world cup . i guess that means they want at least 5 world cups in that time though .
20986,that woulda e devastating . the us got third place back in 1930 .
20987,thats interesting . fo you know who jo stewart is .
20988,i do . he played soccer did n't he ?
20989,he is a comedian but he played soccer . he was pretty good to .
20990,soccer makes more money than most sports combined .
20991,thats understandable considering its popularity among non us nation say i would say at least football and basketball have it beat over here .
20992,i agree . americans call it soccer because it was slang for association football .
20993,i heart the us womens team is pretty good .
20994,"yes , they are pretty good . there exist a variation of soccer where 3 teams face each other at the same tim e ."
20995,the womens team has never placed below third since womens world cup started dale the way back in 91
20996,that 's really you . do you like roots ?
20997,yea hi guess . they are very useful .
20998,did you know ugg boots were invented diy surfers ?
20999,i didnt know tht ; i have never had a pair of ugg boots myself .
21000,me either . the nokia company ot big by making rubber boots .
21001,stats interesting . well im gon na have to be going have a good one .
21002,are you a bi fan of watching sports ?
21003,"i 'm a bigger fan of plays them than i am of watching them , especially sports like soccer"
21004,have you watched womans soccer before ? they say the us 's team is undefeated
21005,"i hearts something but that too ! i guess the last team they played against ws scotland , too"
21006,which country do you consider o have produced more soccer talent ireland or scotland ?
21007,i ' not sure in i do n't watch it enough to keep track . i guess they 'll be playing the woudl cup in france in the summer
21008,i hope they keep it up lets see how ; hong tobey can maintain that winning streak
21009,"it ' nice thati hey ' , l have a bit of a break before playing in france , and they can work on their strategy . i ca n't imagine playing with jetta"
21010,thats da recipe for some fatigue players they definitely need to get acclimated first before the big game
21011,for sure . but this break will be good for them so theyd an pres their legs before something a important as the world up
21012,hve you watched the world cup in previous years ? l you rememebr what zinidine inane did ?
21013,"i do n't usually watch it , so no , i do n't . what happened ?"
21014,during the game against italy the french player inane got angry at the of the italian players mocked his herd ac an emit him likd epa shrink lol
21015,that 's crazy ! what 's crazier is that the city for the 2022 fifa world cup does n't exist yet
21016,well i guess they better hurry up and get to building lol
21017,"they wo n't gain anything economically or hosting , but i guess it 's good publicity"
21018,thats what i do understand how can they gain nothing when they had millions from the tourism it brings all those people a food and stay for vacation
21019,"because it costs them more to update their infrastructure . for the us , that does n't seem like it would be as big of a deal , especially since the american team never pales below third as o 911"
21020,have you seen ther us of the olympic stadium in athens its pretty sad the re all looking horrible
21021,"i that so long ago though . i 'm not sur if soccer was even a sport then , though it makes more money than the other major sports combined"
21022,no lol j 'm talking about teh stadiums from the olympics in 2004
21023,hello ! do you like birds ?

21026,yes there are . i wonder if we are going to have problems with the server here . hm . some birds fly from alaska to norther mexico without sleeping when migrating .
21027,that 's pretty amazing ! hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct an repair their nests .
21028,"yeah , those achieving little beasts ! they look beautiful but they are sneaky !"
21029,lol yea the are . there are wild birds in australia thati an mimic things like car alarms an chain saws . ca you imagine if you heard a chainsaw flying sound you at night !
21030,"yeah , i would probably get a rifle and start shooting ! lol probably star swearing protective hats too ."
21031,"yeah , if they came imitate what i be they can imitate new lot of things . like perhaps rowling or crying . pretty scary ."
21032,probably imitate the sound of atm bees and then the out your cash !
21033,these birds are gon na get too smart and take over someday ! the dodo bird is actually a member of the pigeon family .
21034,the dodo was not terribly mart ; . and pigeons dont he too smart either . what do you think of our friend the sun ?
21035,"yesh , theyd o seem to belong together it i love the sun , i ca n't wait for it to be warm again so i cna go at in it !"
21036,our friend the sun is quite big . and accounts for most of the mass in the solar system .
21037,"it is actually white , but perceived as yellow !"
21038,"yes , hte trickery of the atmosphere has alluded us ! if you get the sun from the moon , i is white ."
21039,crazy ! l lightening bolt is 5 hotter than the suns surface .
21040,"i dont think it would be easy to harness the energy of lightning , but the sun , on the other hand , offers much energy ."
21041,"yes , it produces enough energy in one second that could meet the needs of the planet for 500000 years ."
21042,"if we could capture it and store it , that woudl be great ! anyway , great chat !"
21043,it was great chatting with you too !
21044,"yesh , h age a great weekend !"

21046,"hi , how are you ? what do you think our friend hte sun ?"
21047,i love it ! cant live without it
21048,"yes , the sun serves many of my daily needs without fail . i appreciate his constancy ."
21049,did you know its actually white and not yellow !
21050,"yes , that is a trick of the atmosphere ! it think if you look a the sun from the moon , it is white ."
21051,even with everything else in the solar system . the sun still counts for 99 . 86 percent of mass
21052,"it i a big boy , and really does hog the mass . but that is fine . there is enough to go around ."
21053,"it produces enough energy in a second to power our planet for 500 , 000 years ."
21054,"if we could capture and store it all , that would be great . but where would we keep it ? its just a much !"
21055,im unsure we coul in just like the energy produced by lighting
21056,"that would be great , if we could capture the engergy of lightning ! probably too difficult though . star is the better way to go ."
21057,and a bolt of lightning is hotter than the surface of the sun ! sounds dangerous
21058,"'s , it does . ill make sure to avoid the lightning both . or swear a special hat to protect me ."
21059,hats can also offer som protection from suburbs !
21060,"yes , that is true . the sun is a atrocious friend . he can sometimes go overboard . a good hat can be our ally ."
21061,did you know that cowboy as were not the most popular in the old west ?
21062,"dig suess those movies have lied to , e ! i thought everyone wore a cowboy hat , cowboy or not ."
21063,thats what i thought as well ! i hey looks like they gave good shade base well
21064,what was the most popular hat then ?
21065,it was called the bowler . do you know what those are ?
21066,"yes , the round hat . very stylish l but not really a cowboy hat to m . that is interesting . anyway , great chat !"

21069,"i di n't kno that t , i have been coloring it hte 2wrogn color my whole life , do ! why is it white ?"
21070,it just is . it only looks yellow due to the atmosphere .
21071,"that makes sense , the sun is amazing , you know what is hotter than the sun ?"
21072,"no , what she is ? a lightening bolt ?"
21073,"yea , a lightening bolt is 5x hotter ! that is hot !"
21074,wholly molly ! that is hot .

21076,"i either . what abot birds , do you like birds ?"
21077,"i like birds , tiny are so interesting . i like seeing hummingbirds they are amazing"
21078,wel apparently birds bones are hollow .
21079,"i wonder if that helps them fly better . which beings more , he bone or teh feather ?"
21080,i think the feathers actually weight more . pretty crazy .
21081,"wow ! how do n't they crush themselves landing , we will never know . i heard wild birds in australia and o crazy things"
21082,really ? like what do they do ?
21083,"the can mimic different sounds like cameras , car alarms , and chainsaws . they probably have evolved that way because of tourism"
21084,"wow , that must be pretty freaking cook . sims birds can fly from alaska to mexico without sleeping ."
21085,"wow , i can barely drive 2 hours without almost falling asleep . nerds are amazing , i think birds evolved from dinosaurs . something like that"

21093,yeah ! i am no sure waht they spend all their postage on though . . . . do they still do the dvds ?
21094,i believe they do still mail did 's . i do n't even own a dvd player anymore o i 'm not certain a that was a very short process for me as red boxes popped up as a better alternative ? . i keep trying to watch the new ted bundy documentary on netflix but i fall asleep haha
21095,hahaha ! i tend to fall asleep watching tv too . maybe that 's a sign . i love in chicago and its supposed to he 04 tomorrow . that will be a good day to watch some netflix !

21098,"hats off to ya for giving take i could n't even visit ! anyone ho takes th time to visit kiddos in a hospital is an a plus van in my book . oddly enough , i had no idea there had been any sequel to the original jurrasic park for chris pratt to joke to steven spielberg about giving him the lead in jurassic park 4 . like , was n't one enough ? !"
21099,"rings ? i never watched the original . i read the book first and it was so good that i did n't want the movie o ruin it for me . adn im not usually the guy who reads the book first so i am keeping that memory , 25 years later . . ."
21100,"lol i watched the first one way back in hte nienteen hundreds , ! , and tha was plenty . i remember it being huge at the time . aparently it took six hours to render one frame of a rainsoake dot ex in jurassic park . sometimes i wonder if the film industry troy requires that much time or if they simply hae a different work ethic caned bosses than bue collar ants on a dirtmound like myself ."
21101,ha !
21102,chris pratt waited tables at bubble gump shrimp company . . . buuuuuuuut that was in miami . does it count as being a broke id living in mahi and working as a matter ? oi 'd rather be broke in mahi than anchorage any day . . .
21103,"definitely ! cna you imagine tipping uni money days nd then watching him on parks an drew the next ? ' hey only , our waiters 's on tv ! '"
21104,that would be find . i had no idea hrs pratt nwas ap so many movies and has been on tv for a solid decade now . no kinda makes me fee old .

21106,"too , me about it ! e just saw metallica lat night with our three soon , 21 , 18 and 14 , there were people sitting on their phone and my youngest son was floored . of course we 've taken the to ll sorts of concers , from buffett to buckethead to antivax and layer . . . . so i'ts even worse having kids and legitimately asking if ariana grande is a person or something new at taco bell then sharing the music and saying , ' oh heck naw . pass ! '"
21107,buffet ! ? ! ? 2 so much fun ! my daughter is 5 and i so want her to experience the parking lot before big 's too late . . .
21108,"buffett is my annual holiday bt he kids love it nad because i go every year , it 's an all day adventure and yeah , the parking lot is the place to be if not partying on the lawn l i fear the day i have to sit at a buffett show ! take her take all your friends it 's legit excellent for families . wath out for the left handed cigarettes though ; ,"

21114,i have not seen it either but i did read that book . it was soooo good that i never saw the first one in fear that it would think my love for the book .
21115,that 's a good poiting . sometimes films can ruin stings . is fallen kingdom based on a book ?
21116,"i am not sure but i do not think so . creighton , sp ? , came out with two and the first one was great while the second one was ok . i do not think he continued writing after the second one ."
21117,"creighton , i believe . i bet he got tired of writing them . he must have made a ton of cash off the first movie as well . no incentive ."
21118,"right ! i wonder how much writers the off of movies , not the bump in book sales bts strictly from the movie ?"
21119,"well , since they wrote the book , i imagine his deal was good , usually writers do n't make as much as actors . are you s fan of netflix ?"
21120,i am . are you ?
21121,"i have watched them in the past , but no tsoi much now . they burn up an astonishkgn amount of bandwidth ."
21122,i hard that . them and youtube . are you more of a fan of youtube ?
21123,"i go to youtube for music and news . youtube is owned by google , so i guess they share search engine technology ."
21124,"wow . that makes sense , since it is the second largest search engine ."
21125,what the you think the folks at blockbuster thought when they saw teh rise of netflix ?
21126,so angry ! the loss of revenue and ujlitmately demise had to be a cause of anger for many . although hte corporate offices probably got golden parachutes . . .
21127,"very us . the top people redid fine , 've though they could have bought netflix for cheap back in the day ."
21128,sad that all the little people had to lose their jobs though . maybe if they were better visionaries . . .
21129,"most people can not foresee teh power of the internet . netflix still pays a ton on postage . why , o you think ?"
21130,nice chatting with you !

21196,i do as well . were you aware that as of 2018 th franchise was estimated to be worth 65 billion making it the fifth highest grossing media franchise ? that 's a lot of money .
21197,i did n't know that . it is alot of money . funny james earl jones only got 7500 for recording all of garth vader 's lines or star wars .
21198,that ' z crazy ! i was not aware of that . his voice is so iconic to the franchise .
21199,"yeah , it is . i ca n't imagine anybody else doing darth vader but him ."
21200,me either . did you know that star wars has even been dubbed in navajo ?
21201,"i had heard hat , its very popular movie so i guess it 's been dubbed in many languages . did you realize that 10th century fox was convinced it was going to be a flop ?"
21202,i had heard that . i believe lucas made a deal to get merchandising rights because of that ?
21203,"yes , he did . such a smart man . he agreed to forgo an additional 500 , 000 directing . in return for veep the licensing and merchandising rights ford himself ."
21204,wow ? ! the merchandising for tha franchise is big business . people ware inst about collecting it . that was an incredible goods business decision of is part .
21205,it made him a billionaire and cost cox billions . i bet they kick themselves about that decision all the time . ol
21206,"oh i ' , m positive that they do . it 's out topics ut do you enjoy any country music ?"
21207,why i sure do . do you ?
21208,i like the older stuff like patsy cline or johnny cash . did you know that george strait and jeff bezos are cousins ? !
21209,"ho interesting k , both of them so successful and rich from different industries . i didnt ' know that there were only 2 african americans in the country musc jail lof fame 3d id you ?"
21210,it is very interesting . i didn ot know that . i 'm honestly surprised there are any . i ca n't think of any african american country artists .
21211,"9 was thinking charley pride , but that was the only one i could come up with . i know there are more in country music nowadays , though ."
21212,i must admit that i a knot very knowledgeable about the modern artists . were you aware hat henry ford helped popularize country music by financing it because he was afraid of the ' urban decadence ' of jazz music ?
21213,"i did't know henry ford had his hand in country music . i can believe the urban decadence of jazz , though . did you know clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast , pianist , and has scored several films ?"
21214,i di do . i took him for metre of a country guy .
21215,i am a huge star wars fan . have you ever seen them ?
21216,"ohh well yea , i was a fan in their 20th century fox days and still today with them being owned by disney"
21217,it is amazing how much a pop culture phenom if has become . i wonder if the actors or george lucas had any idea way back in 1977
21218,"no way , the value has gone up to a whopping 6million ! back the the was just making a space movie , now its a phenom"
21219,so true . there is even epic series of books that give back story and what the future was after the original trilogy . i have to admit that having read the books i was rooting for them to pulls from those but they did n't
21220,"oh you read the o , lee extended universe stuff ? like with han and leia 's kids before kylo real was a thing ?"
21221,yes ! i was so hoping that when they introduced rey she was going to be the girl twin and tha fluke was off living happily with maria name and his son ben but nope .
21222,"i had read bout ta lot of people speculating thats what they were gon na do with the plot , nut would that have been too obvious ? i dont mind the route they took , i still really like the new movies"
21223,i heard something about the wanted to expand it beyond being just a skywalker story . which kind of makes me sad because that is really the whole point of star wars . the new movies are pretty good though . the graphics are amazing .
21224,"i heard that the so movies are the skywalker can and everything beyond that is just cool stuff happening in the universe , which i 'm all for . like jon favreau is making that tvs now about mandalirian county hunters . i think they need to not do movies like solo and some up with some original characters pike rogue one"
21225,it would be amazing to watch as priest bout the county hunters ! i did n't mind solo . i like gettin the backstory on som of th beloved characters of the past .
21226,"i liked it too but if they want to get that magic again and if they want to stray from the skywalker family , htey new to develop a new cast of characters"
21227,and give them some depth . i do n't think they developed poe enough . the movies yet . i think he could have a really interesting backstory .
21228,yea apparently hes gay too ? and was a long lost love who taught him to be a pilot ? somthing they denver even touched on in the movies . he coudl be such a well developed character if they give him som more screen time
21229,i would love to see a mini series for tv about the vibration of the kids on that casino planet . i feel like after they were visited in the third trilogy there is going to be some sort of uprising and i would make for an amazing movie .
21230,"i hope so , there should e some payoff to that planet and i think there ill be . and since j is finishing the story he started , i fee she will end it in a satisfying way"
21231,his work is amazing . it is no wonder that he was able tos secure a guinness world record for this franchise .
21232,"yea i agree . i think jj was a big fan of jazz music too . he wasnt alive in hte 1920s during the jazz age , but he appreciates al lof those classics"
21233,i thinkk jazz relaly speaks to the creative soul since it is so reform . great jazz musicians say they never know how a piece will end when they are opposing .
21234,which is crazy too me . jazz is so complex . tupac even went to the baltimore school of the arts to study it
21235,i think jazz has its finger into a ot of muscle pipes so to speak . i did pro neat how everyone thinks their own favorite music id unique but actually they all weave together .
21236,hi good morning . do you have an kids ? it seems like incredibles 2 would qb a good movie to watch with them .
21237,i have the kids . i user to play the video game when i can younger . i remember it was called the incredibles : rise of the underminer .
21238,awesome . apparently 13 years before incredibles 2 came out there was a release in video game format !
21239,"hahaha . that kind of tells uo maya ge . incredibles is a great movie , but i love comedy film . have you watch nerd rock from th sun ?"
21240,nope never have . but i would since it won a golden globe back in '97 !
21241,"k love any kind of movies , specially a genre of movies called bromatic comedies ."
21242,"oh nice . me too actually . one of my favorite movies was pineapple express ! seth rogan nanu dfrnaco , so funny ."
21243,it was so impressed when i found out that that the first silent movies were comedies
21244,"yeah that is so funny , slapstick comedy is . i also like comedies because lost traditionally have a happy ending ; except for the black comedy variation ."
21245,did you know that ther jewels a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes ?
21246,ha ha no i did n't know thagt jsut i always wonder what happened to the fame caused by the superheroes . surprisingly there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states .
21247,wow . i did n't know there were that many . i read something funny the other day about garfield and a book series named pet force ep hhahaha
21248,garfield is a superhero ? one superhero that does n't sound very interesting is normal man he does n't have any powers .
21249,"hahahha . . . i am not sure , but i thought it was the cat ."
21250,yeah garfield the cat lol ! one thing i died n't know is that stanley wrote 15 dc comics . very surprising .
21251,i know . they kin doof were reimagining popular superheroes like batman adn superman .
21252,yes exactly . so cool the superhero has been around since 1930 !
21253,incredibly e ! but there are not too many female superheroes .
21254,"tha i true . i am sure wonder woman gets lonely sometimes ! thye safe pet force , but now they need more womans superheroes . it was nice to talk with you today . have a good one !"
21255,you goo . see you next time .
21256,"bye now : ,"
21257,hello have you seen the incredibles 2 ?
21258,"hello , i have not see land of the series . is it good ?"
21259,yes very entertaining ! great attention to the story as well . i cant believe emit old 13 years to make the sequel
21260,really ? why so long ?
21261,"i dont know , maybe too much to do . maybe it eas actually dawn lol"
21262,haha thats possible
21263,the incredible movies are se tin thee 1960 's
21264,"oh yeah ? that 's cool , what other types of movies do you ike ? how about comedy ?"
21265,"yah love comedy , i hear ryan stiles dropped out of high school to pursue a career in comedy . hes great in that show who line i it anyways ."
21266,"oh yeah , he surely makes me laugh !"
21267,have you ever watched 3rd us from the sun ?
21268,"i love that show , i was excited when they won a golden globe award . i almost painted ! !"
21269,"that is a good show , i kinda cant believe that it beat out seinfield and friends thoug lol"
21270,"well , the comedy gods cars on their side haha"
21271,to you like ' bromantic comedies ' ?
21272,i do indeed alike harold and kumar nad the hangover ! !
21273,yeah those are great movies ! the hangover series especially lol
21274,"yeah , i prefer teh harold and kumar series better through especially when all they want to do is go to where castle haha"
21275,ll those little burgers are delicious .
21276,yeah the are they are listen pieces f heaven in between two delectable burns .
21277,"its been great chatting , thanks for the convo !"
21278,hello . do you like star wars ?
21279,not as much as i used to . as a kid i loved it but those prequels sourced me to the rest of it .
21280,i agree . the older movies are much better . it is a popular series though to a lot of people . star wars i 'the second highest grossing movie of all time .
21281,"i remember being very excited when the first prequel was released , i paid to see it t the big fancy theater in d c , the uptown"
21282,what is that theater like ?
21283,it 's one of those big old theaters with just one big screen
21284,"cool . say , did you know that george lucas ' wife worked on the movie ?"
21285,was it how they met or were they married at thet one ? its ' always funny that the producers had no faith in the movie before it came out .
21286,they were married at the time . she made some major changes like obi wan 's death and sushi and won a academy award for editing .
21287,"goo for her , still over shadowed by her husband though . with all the money they 've made from the merchandising i 'm sure she does n't mind ."
21288,probably so . star ward holds the record for most successful film merchandising franchise .
21289,"my son loves the star wars must , he 's learned to play all the music on piano ."
21290,that is really impressive . i used to have the album of the sound track from the original movie back un the day . those songs were fantastic !
21291,"i think i did too , not a hundred percent sure . my dad had jazz playing all the time and homo e , i think i wanted something i like ."
21292,i like jazz . i 'm not real familiar with all of the artists but i do like the must . i especially like the swing bands of the 1930s .
21293,"i think my dad turned me away from it , you know , the more someone tries to force it on you the less likely you are o move toward it ."
21294,"i know what you mean . my parents listened to a lot f country amen kid as a kid so i turned to rock and pop music . now though , i do like some country i have to admit . i think george strait is very good ."
21295,"that 's another mystery to me . i ' v lived primarily in dc and country does n't make much of an impression there . if anything i lie the older country , han williams and thay ."
21296,i guess henry ford may have failed then . he helped finance country music back in the day due to his fears of jazz music and it 's urban decadence .
21297,"people are always fearful that the new thing will lead to the old of civilization . country is just folk musc originally from europe , jazz is probalby just folk music from a different source ."
21298,true . jazz comes rom the blues and ragtime i thunk .
21299,have yu been to the dc area before ?
21300,i have but it was a long time ago . it looks like there 's alway sa lot of stuff going on there . they ave a lot of different events at the convention center one of them is ac convention called awesome con . it ' is a comiccon with a lot of different people . it looks pretty cool
21301,"yah i heard about the comiccon that sounds like a great thing to do , also the showcase with jenna camille , that is another must do thing om y list"
21302,that does sound good ! have you ever been yo a comic con by teh way ? also i would go see justin pack personally
21303,"i havent but maybe this year i can make it , one or the stands i woul ; d visit would be the star wars stand"
21304,i would check that out too ! george lucas is a genius to come up with that whole series of movies . although i must say i do n't like the new ones myself .
21305,"i dont like hte new ones either , i loved episode i and episode iii but rogue ons was terrible"
21306,rogue one is horrible haha . i agree with you there . do you like james cameron ? he was apparently inspired by star wars
21307,"i do , i think his a great director and movies can inspire us to take different paths , thank god james cameron became a director hawks to the influence of star wars"
21308,i agree ! i really like his movie terminator and terminator 2 . what is really weird i stat george lucas says r2d2 is telling the entire story of star wars . only he 's telling it several hundred years in the future
21309,"thats a creative spin to the story , r2d2 is a badass , his my favorite robot so if anyone has to tell the story im glad its him and not a suit roof"
21310,"haha that 's funny . what 's funny to is that fox gave george lucas merchandising rights instead of the 500 , 000 for part of his directing fee . and it helps to masked im a billionaire lol"
21311,"it is funny , t hey of a lot of money there or sure , star wars is a really popular franchise so yeah , did you know that in 2013 star wars was dubbed in navajo ,"
21312,no i did n't know that ! i also did n't know that star wars holds the guinness world records title for ' most successful film merchandising franchise '
21313,"i guess lucas is reaaly happy about that and fox is regretting it but time , maria lucas is realy important as well , the success of the franchise is in great part due to her"
21314,i agree . she does n't get enough credit ! do you like country music at all ?
21315,"no not relaly , do you like it ?"
21316,i can ? t way that i do . buy i di no know that the fender stratocaster was intended originally for country music
21317,"i didnt know that either that is a great guitar , i love jazz better though , find it relaxing"
21318,yeah i think jazz is mork relaxing . who do you listen to exactly when you listen to jazz ? i also never knew what dizzy gillespie ran for president lol
21319,"i dont have a favorite artist , and in a parallel universe he won for sure lol"
21320,do you1 ike comedies ?
21321,"i do , i love it !"
21322,"me too , what are your favorite ?"
21323,i really like monty python . did you know that graham chapman was a medical doctor until he gave up his practice to concentrate on comedy ?
21324,"no , i did n't know that . what was he in ?"
21325,he was in monty python .
21326,"oh , i 've never actually seen it , . was it any good ?"
21327,"yes it 's a funny comedy for it 's time . it 's funny , i 'm studying computer programming and right now i 'm learning the python programming language . it was named partly to honor the british comedy group monty python ."
21328,"interesting , i did n't know that . i have to use both python and java at my job . mostly python for the skit library ."
21329,"that 's awesome , i like learning it s far ."
21330,"yeah , l it ios pretty cool stuff , but repetitive e ."
21331,i 've caught that so far . do you like to watch comedy central ?
21332,"nah , they cancel way too many shows ."
21333,it 's crazy that the 've canceled over 100 shows in the last 30 years .
21334,"that is hilarious , but i can belive it . i think some shows are no good oj that chanel o b honest ."
21335,yeah they yo . did you know that ' the green lantern ' was originally going to be a comedy starring jack black ?
21336,"no , i did n't know that . did you see it ?"
21337,"i have sen it , it was ok with ryan reynolds . i do n't think it woud ; ahve been food good with jack black ."
21338,"yeah , i can believe that he has n't made a good movie n a long time . well , nice chatting !"
21339,"nice chatting with you too , i hope you have a great rest now your day !"
21340,you too !
21341,"hi , how are you ?"
21342,"i 'm pretty good , how about yourself ? i 'm dancing in my chair listening to imagine dragons , waiting for this work day to end ."

21349,states . the answer to what do i hate more is always snakes . . . i ca n't even watch them on tv .
21350,"i 'm a kiss whine it wolves to the cold , i can play like snakes , but you ca n't kill the cold . the fear of snakes is hardwired in our brains , o it 's natural to be said of them ."
21351,"i gues it 's regional becuase i can always put on more layers . i ca n't run away from snakes fast enough ! what do you do for a living , besides dance ?"
21352,"i 'd like to imagine that i 'm a professional dancer , but nobody seems to want to pay me money . in actuality i 'm a biomedical equipment technical nat a childrens hospital ."
21353,nice . sounds fun . what 's up with these flying snakes ? are those the most testifying ?
21354,"that is crazy . i 'd probably pass out if i saw one , then move to new zealand ."

21356,"i 'm down ! to me it would be a snake , i mean , is n't that what a snake is ? haha . there was a guy that told me that there was something like that in the area i the , but i hav yet to see any ."

21389,"i didn ot know that ! americans have to get more into it ! i wonder if they would be more into did if they watched the version where three teams face each other at the same time l probably not , could be very confusing ."
21390,i think youre night . the world cup is the most prestigious association footbal ltouranment int he world .
21391,i 's th world 's most popular sport too !
21392,"yes , 've heard it exceeds the olympic games im viewership . ,"
21393,and americans are the only ones who call it soccer because it was slang for association football .
21394,"oh , interesting . did you know that the city se todo host the 2022 qatar fifa world cup does not yet exist ?"
21395,that is interesting . you know jon stewart ? he used to be a soccer player in college and represented the us at the pan american maccabi games in brazil .
21396,that is really cool . a multi talented guy from the sounds of it .
21397,"yeah . mesut ozil is another talented one and he donated his eur 300 , 000 world cup victory bonus to pay for surgeries for 23 children in brazil ."
21398,that is great to hear . did you know there are noe economic gains for the countries that have played us to the olympics or the world cup ?
21399,"ye s , i 've heard that . but maybe it helps some places for future tourism ?"
21400,i woudl think so . especially since soccer makes more money than all other sports combined .
21401,wells maybe florida born shaq moore wills welp more americans tomb e interested in soccer . he plays in la lisa .
21402,sound like he is the shaq of soccer !
21403,exactly a he was playing for smaller spanish teams but now then played for la libya . he was invited to a u . s . national team because of that .
21404,do you enjoy sports ?
21405,sure . lately i 've been into association footbal and wrestling . how about you ?
21406,"i also like soccer . i was surprised tha ton a global scale , it is the world 's most popular sport"
21407,"yeah , is n't that wild ' in the usa , nfl seems to overshadowed soccer , but the biggest difference i se is that nfl s a lot of waiting around , while soccer is a lot of running around ."
21408,"well the average nfl game ahs only ; y 11 minutes of gameplay , while in soccer , they run an average 7 miles per game ."
21409,nice ! all the actions help some to burn calories just watching ! hve you seen the version of the game where 3 teams play at the same time
21410,"i heard about it and i think it must be chaotic , but in a good way . i wold love too see it"
21411,"me too ! i wish soccer was more popular in teh states . there are a few wellknown people that are into the he though . did ou know the comedian , jon stewart , was a soccer player that competed to the world loves ?"
21412,i did n't . i mean soccer is both popular an thas influence since it makes more money than most other popular sports combined
21413,"that must be at the world level , like team competing toward the world cup l right ?"
21414,"probably . one german ; layer got 300k euros for a world cup victory bonus , but instead he donated it to pay for the surgeries of 23 children in brazil"
21415,that 's awesome ! woud n't it nd great if one of those in grew up to be a wold cup athlete ? i was the world cup finals were held annually instead o every four years .
21416,well the next world cup is set o be hosted by qatar in 2022
21417,i hear about that . are n't they building a new city for that event ?
21418,"yes the city does n't yet exist . there are no net economic gains for hosting countries , but i wonder if they benefit from prestige or tourism typo warrant thee to bundle and entirely new city ."
21419,"yeah , and what will happen to the city after the masses depart ? d o you think the usa has a chance to win ? the us got third place in the first fifa cup ."
21420,"while soccer isn ; t us 's most popular sport , they have a good chance given their strong track record of never being below 3rd place since 1991"
21421,"you know , back in the us , the hungarian team won all nut 1 game over a six year period . six year s ! that 's insane !"
21422,they must have been having an amazing year . i wonder how they did at th last world cup .
21423,"good question . hey , you ever attended ar real wrestling match ? i wrestled in hs , and i can remember the first time a fellow classmate asked , ' where are the ones ? ; '"
21424,"i have not , but i have when a lot of wrestling moves in mixed maritala row in a cage"
21425,"yeah , that 's brutal stuff . hard for a person to survive or long in that sport . you know abe lincoln was a wrestler ? quite good to ! he only lot one hatch in a career that lasted over 300 matches !"
21426,i did n't know that . i do know that wrestling hard a long and distinguished history with even plato heading a professional wrestling career before he became famous a philosopher
21427,"that 's a far cry from today 's professional wrestlers , like the macho man , who wears bizarre outfits ."
21428,"in any case , thank you for the enlightening chat about wrestling . have a nice day ."
21429,"hi , how are you doing over there ? you good ?"

21434,"it was pretty goo d , but i was never all that good at it . new zealand was th only defeated terms at the 2010 world cup ."

21436,yeah me too . bt japans bidding for the fifa world up in 2022 .
21437,"they are getting the olympics in 1020 , which is in to be quite expensive . i so n't think they 'll make they , but will get a lot of attention . i thought qatar had the cup for 2022 ."
21438,"wow , i wonder what they think of football over there ?"
21439,they probably follow the texas in europe . premier league . champions league . the money that soccer generates i amazing .
21440,"am , i would think so . the average soccer player runs 7 , fines per game ."
21441,they must lose a ton o water weight .
21442,"yeah , i 'm not sure how much . apparently greenland ca n't join fifa because there is not enough grass for a soccer field ."
21443,"well , tat 's unfair . the black eis called greenland , yet they do not have grass . maybe they should value a variant called ice soccer or something ."
21444,it 's pretyy funny . did you watch wrestling ?
21445,not really much of wrestling fan . do you ?
21446,"well , i like macho man . he was signed to play baseball at one point ."

21450,hilarious . well nice chatting with you .
21451,do you happen to enjoy comedy ? i watch a lot of comedy movies adn standup .
21452,i do like comedy . i really like comedy tv shows . i was pretty happy when 3rd rock from the un won best comedy series back in 1997 .
21453,i 'm surprise it won then . it had to have been up against seinfeld .
21454,it was . it was up against them and friends and frasier . all of which are among the greats of comedy and it still won .
21455,wow ! that 's some stiff competition . wares you familiar with demetri martin ?
21456,the name is n't ringing a bell right away . is he or she an actor in comedy ?
21457,he 's a standup comedian . he had his own show on comedy central for maybe two seasons .

21459,it 's a ot of wordplay usually . eh was accepted into harvard law but left to pursue comedy because he was bored .
21460,"wow , i 'm not sure what to say to that lol ! he was bored at harvard law ? i upon law could be boring if go would rather be a comedian ."
21461,his comedy is pretty smart and he 's been successful lso i guess it worked out for him . do you know ryan stiles ?
21462,i 'm feeling poetry out of touch right now because i have to say no . for some reason i think he may be an actor . the name sounds a little familiar .
21463,its in a while since i ? 've seems him . he was a tall thin guy on whose any is it anyway back when that was on .
21464,"oh , i think i know who you are talking about . seems ike maybe i 've seen him as a guest on other shows like the middle ."
21465,probably . he died out of high school to pursue comedy . i 'm sending a trend with comedians .
21466,it he seem like there is one ! i 'm ol school . do you know who bill murray is ?
21467,i loves bill murray .
21468,i do too . i 'm not sure if he 's a drop out but i do know tha the says that kung fu hustle is the supreme achievement in comedy but his day and age .
21469,while i do love him i 'm going to have to disagree with him on that one . have you heard of hte term bromantic comedy ?
21470,i think i have to disagree too ! i 've heard the term bromance but i do n't think i 've heard it describe comedy . why ?
21471,its ' a fairly new term they are using to describe movies like pineapple express or i love you man .
21472,hello ho ware you doing today ?
21473,"i 'm going alright , up bright and early with some coffee , watching a comedy movie to start my day . how about you ?"
21474,that 's good . i 'm going great myself . did you know kim jongil statue in team america is actually a real person in makeup ?
21475,"is it really ? haha the only real person in that movie i think , arent they all puppets ?"
21476,haha yea i think s . i 've never actually see nthe move .
21477,"neither have i , though i bet its get . i 'm more of a kung fu hustle in of guy . ike bill murray , i will much for that movie forever"
21478,that 's good i like those types of movies too . did you now michael chili went bald at age 20 because of a mishap with theater makeup ?
21479,"oh my god i cant imagine , stats awful ! did he sue you think ?"
21480,that would stink . i 'm not sure if i sued or not .
21481,"i would , i never to hold to what little air left !"
21482,haha yea my hairline is starting to secede myself .
21483,di doyou know what the pictures we always see of pilgrims is actually kind nonrepresentative of their style ? they often wore a lot of color
21484,"oh wow i didn ' r , now that . i saw that ryan stiles dropped out of high school to pursue a career in comedy ."
21485,"and im happy he did ! sorta . i mean its important otto finish your education but if he did drop out , we would have never have even him is whose line"
21486,i agree . 3rd rock from the sun won the golden globe for best comedy series back in 1997 .
21487,and it beat seinfeld ! which i like a lot more . d you like 3rd rock ?
21488,"i never really watched 3rd rock , but i really liked seinfeld ."
21489,"same , i even like friends a lot more than 3rd rock ! im surprised"
21490,did you know rip curl makes clothes in north korea but label says made in china ?
21491,i wonde why . do you think its some sort of legal issue ?
21492,not too sure on that . it was great talking to you !
21493,"cosmetics obviously can be used to enhance o alter appearance , but the use to change one 's fragrance is a little more subtle category of cosmetics ."
21494,that 's true . people often think of cosmetics as being associated with appearance bu few thinkk directly of improving your own sent .
21495,"i scan also eb natural products . for instance , coconut oil is a great moisturiaer and it smells nice also ."
21496,"that is true , thou you need to be careful wit hit . di you hear how a mistake with theater makeup made michael chili bald when he was only 20 ? that stuff can be dangerous ."
21497,yes um y ad read a story from a newspaper once about the autos of a man who died from hair dye being absorbed into his skin . even the aluminum in most deodorants has some wagner .
21498,"yeah that sounds like a nightmare . there 's also plenty of stuff people use every day that they don ' even think of as cosmetics like shampoo and hair gel , but that 's what they are . interesting how we think of different products ."
21499,"true . i was in the grocery store yesterday morning and ran into anice cooper , he likes here in phoenix , . he had on makeup , his signature eye shadow and nascar even a 9 am ."
21500,"really ? interesting that you run into a celebrity in a grocery store debut hey they got ta eat too , right ? i hear celebrities rely a lot o ncosmetics , i heard keanu reeves gave most of his salary money frost he matrix o the people who did his make up ."
21501,"that movie relied on a lot of makeup and special effects . that was generous of him . i guess one would consider those costumes as a type of clothing . you know , every human society wears clothing of some kind ."
21502,"yeah , kinda strange that even societies that developed in very warm climates still wear clothes . did you know that apple had a clothing line once ? t hey should dry that again , i bet apple 's fans would rush to store it buy apple shirts , haha ."
21503,"apple used to be the brand so he clothing proabably was a great promotional tool . in the early days apple users were sorta of snobb8sh about it . now branding on the outside of clothing is commonplace . of course , some clothing is gender specific but those mines get blurry nowadays ."
21504,"yeah that 's true they make clothing out of all kinds of things like textiles , thin sheets of materials , and animal skin , though that last one has fallen i popularity in recent years ."
21505,"tat os sur true . however , no one complains about leather shoes or bells . really stylish people can tell if your clothes look tailored by looking for collar gaps ."
21506,"yeah , that is strange that those have n't been complained about yet . something for the next generation , perhaps . all the tricks to make cheaper clothing look more stylish will generally only fool people who do n't care about looking stylish . pretty ironic ."
21507,god point . wearing clothing is mostly restricted to humans . the only cases that i can think of that are not is when samba animal is dressed by a human like some people do for their dogs . it is odd that no other animal dresses itself .
21508,"yeah , you 'd think othe animals would try clothing , especially those native to colder climates . but at least animals to n't have to worry bout the various social rules for what to wear any when . those can get very complex ."
21509,yes and one van embarrass him or herself if one violates those rules . i wish i had dressed by child as a pilgrim wearing a red and black checked flannel shirt and told hi to tell the audience at the play that thins is how we dress on weekdays .
21510,"yeah , miss one or two obscure norms about clothing and you 're comedy film material ! you know , comedies have been made since thur silent film era , pretty impressive . i guess you do n't need sound to be funny ."
21511,yes . but they were heavy int salpstikmc which stops being funny when the audience mature .
21512,"yeah , when movies were end slapstick was enough to entertain everybody . but as time went on people needed more and more to get a laugh . that 's why i would n't drop out of school for a job o comedy , no matter ho well it worked out for ryan stiles ."
21513,ha ha . one 's odds of financial success doing that are pretty low . nice chatting !
21514,do you like colorful clothing ?
21515,"yes i do . miguel cabarello who makes bulletproof clothing , has his employees wear them and get shot to test the clothing"
21516,wow that is scary . pilgrims wear black clothing only on special occasions
21517,nice . greeks made asbestos loathing and it was worth as lot
21518,wow . do you know how fashion people can tell if you ever your clothes tailored
21519,"hmm i have no idea , they can measurements"
21520,nope they actually look for collar gaps in your clothes
21521,nice . a guy once wore 70 pieces of clothing so he was not charged the fe at the airport
21522,haha that is funny . did you know apple had a clothing line back in 1986
21523,wow cool . do you know what the old on the pants is ?
21524,"hmm i am no sure , he zipper ? a guy once due a company because they lost his pants"
21525,it is actual ; fly the cloth flap over it . how much did he sues for ?
21526,he sued them for 67 million
21527,wow crazy . women were allowed to wear pants in senate only after 1993
21528,wow that is late in collinsville saggy pants are prohibited
21529,"i like that rule l in paris there was a 200 year ban on women wearing pants , until 2013"
21530,wow that is late . do you like birds ?
21531,i do . do you know why they fly in a v formation ?
21532,"hmm i am ot sure , why is that actually ?"
21533,because it reduces drag by 65 percent and increases rage by 71 percent
21534,yeah . have you heard of the dodo bird ?
21535,the movie black panther is rated as a good movie for childrens . thats interesting !
21536,"my kids re pretty little , so i would n't let them watch it , but maybe 1012 year olds would be okay . i love the girl power portrayed ish blacc panther !"
21537,i agree . 1012 would be more appropriate . there are a few ' s ' words nothing goo extreme ! !
21538,"it seems like movies can eb pretty racy these days , it 's hard to find something that the whole family can enjoy . i have n't aleen early man , but i sisterinlaw said it was goo for all her kid stop see"
21539,hmmm . i have n't seen early man . . . i 'll have to check it out ! ! ! the thing i like abou black pnathe4r is the emphasis on teamwork . . . and the girl power that yiu mentioned is shown with the acknowledgement of female athletes ! ! !
21540,"yes ! it 's pretty unexplored in the superhero universes , it 's refreshing to see women with such important roles"
21541,absolutely ! ! early man seems like i would be interesting . . . its a fun look at prehistoric times ! ! children always like hat type off entertainment ! !
21542,"i 'm not a huge fan of stopmotion , but early man was created by hte made guy who made wallace and groot , so at least he knew what he 's good at"
21543,i think what made black panther interesting is that it focused on the first superheros of color ! ! ! something different ! !
21544,"totally ! i think the cast was fantastic , especially michael b . jordan"
21545,"yesss ! ! lupita anyone ' o , a angela bassett , forest whitaker , d ana luria and daniel kaluuya lab added special touches to the movie . . . . helping to bring the story alive ! !"
21546,"i read that chadwick boseman needed money to study at a summer theater program at oxford but did n't have the money , but then an private benefacto paid for him to go . the private benefactor was denzel washington !"
21547,wow ! ! ! that 's pretty impressive ! ! i am s big fan of diesel washington . . . i had no idea that he acted as a private benefactor and paid for someone else veto study ! ! that 's pretty amazing !
21548,"i know ! i love when people with talent , and money , can help and support others"
21549,absolutely ! ! ! i think that the black panther movie is soemthing that families will talk about together after watching hte movie . . . race . . . wonder . . . . new or . . . all these are portrayed in that movie ! ! ! all positive content ! !
21550,"my only beef with black panther is that it 's long , like over two hours ! i feel ; ike superhero movies are getting super long , i have a hard time following along sometimes"
21551,lol . . . it wa pretty long . . . but exciting nonetheless . the richest superhero is black panther . . . . h e 's worth over 500 billion ! ! bruce hayden was only worth 80 billion ! ! ! what a difference ! !
21552,"i feel like the money as talked about a lot in teh iron man movies , but i did n't hear it so much in black panther"
21553,i was surprised to find out that block panther had nothing to do with the black panther activist ! ! ! i think a lot of people thought so ! !
21554,"yeah , it can be hard to differentiate , butt hey are so different"
21555,yes ! ! ! there are over 300 known superheros in te u . s . and black panther has taken the lead spot ! ! excellent movie and great for the whole family ! ! it has been a pleasure taking to you . have a great day !
21556,"thanks , you too !"
21557,how are you ? are you interested in fashion at all ? bottega vendetta makes really nice leather handbags
21558,"i like to look at some of it , bu something like new york fashion week would be beyond me ."
21559,"yea , i have n't heard much about bottega vendetta but they do n't like putting company logos or initials on their products whuch is kind of refreshing"
21560,"ye s , i do liek that . although then what is the point of getting designs stuff . apparently tom fords new collection was tawdry and vulgar . oh dear ."
21561,if tom ford 's items are considered tawdry and vulgar i might have to check them out lol
21562,"hah . and did you know that apple had a clothing ; line in 1986 . they should ave kept that up , people would totally buy that nowadays"
21563,"no i never knew apple had a clothing line , i figure that would be the antithesis of versa pr gucci or police instead of butera vendetta"
21564,i thought it was interesting that pilgrim clothing was full of color and the only wore black for special occasions . i 'm used to seeing them only in black in illustrations
21565,"yea that is interesting , so is checking collar gaps 5o see if you clothes are tailor , i ' v never though of that"
21566,yeah i 'm no tthat picky or observant . i suppose if you 're in the industry though its important
21567,"yea but the industry can be shady , like rip curl making clothing in north korea but putting mad erin china o nthe label"
21568,"sure , m but there should be more stores lilke the one in alabama that sell stuff from unclaimed baggage i then maybe people could get their stuff back"
21569,i wonder how they are legally able to do that ? they better not sell any of stuff from the d . c . judge tha sues a dry cleaning business for 67 illion
21570,"i think they have set on limits on the amounts people can sue for , w nice is a good think . i 'm glad things have changed since roman times , when wearing pants wa sa sign of barbarism"
21571,i wonder what the romans wore while riding horses since pants were invented to help ride horses
21572,"yes , i wonder when pants were actually invented , but it must have been uncomfortable wearing a skirt and riding a horse ."
21573,i wonder if they ever made pants witht dodo birds before joey became exiting
21574,"how funny that aladdin 's pants were modeled after mc hammer . i did n't know that , but i can totally see it"
21575,yea alladin 's pants do look like mc hammer ' parachute pants

21593,i like watching them . i some birds fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when they migrate . that 's incredible .
21594,birds are amazing . their bones are si hollow
21595,that 's probably what allows them to fly so easily because thier entire skeleton weighs ness than their feathers .

21606,that would be kind of creepy to hear . in most birds their bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers .

21673,i and like that law . did you know that miguel cabarello makes bulletproof clothing and tests them on his employees ? i would n't wan na work there !
21674,me lighter tha sounds scary . people started gearing pawns because of horses . mounted armies gearing pants were more effective than those wearing robes
21675,ankles sense . sk trousers and pant name the same in british and american english but in the uk pants usually means underwear and not trousers or pants . ? ?
21676,"good question . i do know that tailored shorts may be called ' short trousers ' , especially in the uk ."
21677,so many ionconsistenci4s it seems but i guess as long as they know what it means . i want indestructible pants likd 'the hulk .
21678,i use to wear aladdin 's pants after mc hammer .
21679,nice ! it was illegal for women to wear pants in paris until 2013 . say what ? so unfair . it was like that for 200 years .
21680,"i could not live there a way . . all i wear is pants or work . listen to his , a d . c . judge sued a small dry cleaning business for over 67 million for the loss of a car of pants ."

21689,"yes , but not as pets , i have a bird feeder to observe wild birds ."
21690,"hey , that sounds great ! so what kinds of birds come around ?"
21691,"a lot , the most spectacular are the hummingbirds they are so tiny ."
21692,they are beautiful little things . i like to see them flip around . hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests . thy are cunning .
21693,"it sound dangerous , they could get caught in it and be eaten by the spider ."
21694,i guess ! lol slime birds fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when migrating . how do they go without sleep ? i want to know their secret .
21695,maybe very are just giving in the wind and they sleep lightly doing it . like when people sleep when they drive . except it is not deadly .
21696,"oh , i see . well they do n't have phones to distract the . that 's good . people an be real dodos behind the wheel ."
21697,"dodo became extinct without sleeping at the wheel , funny to think they are related to pigeons , which are not extinct ."
21698,"pigeons ar knot terribly smart . but they breed political ; y . theyd annoy make interestings rounds . there are wild birds in australia that can mimic the sound of cameras , car alarms , and chainsaws ."
21699,that would drive me crazy . especially if they started to make phone sounds . bu taking hp to chainsaw sounds is also terrible .
21700,"now that 's a horror movie . channing the subject , what kind of trousers do you like ?"
21701,"i like jeans , romans woul dot like them , they probalby judge them as barbaric c ."
21702,"i guess they looked simple and poor , refined . hard to ride horses with them , i guess ."
21703,i think it would be tougher to ride a horse in a roman toga . but i never tired it .
21704,us guess the romans woul shave stunned pants event though it were garter . fashion is more important .
21705,"fashion is important , that 's why aladdin 's cats are like those of mc hammer 's , and not disco pants ."
21706,"i thought mc homer modeled his pants on aladdin 's , actually ! lol . oh well . collinsville , il has a law that prohibits ' saggy pants . ' i understand ."
21707,"maybe it is a agriculture town , they would a a safety issue on s farm , and a snaitagion issue in a slaughter hous e ."
21708,"yes , that 's true . i think it 's a terrible liek . not really cool . anyway , great chat !"
21709,"you too , have a great day ."
21710,"hello , what are your thoughs on tesla inc ?"
21711,"i think tupac area re pretty cool and innovative , i 'd love to ave a mode s"
21712,"i would like to have one of those too , an s , x or a model 3 all seems like great cars"
21713,"i never knew the telsa model sr puns on linux , i wonder how hard it would be to hack into"
21714,"it must be really hard , i heard that software is really secure , the s is road tested at an indoor track ,"
21715,"that 's pretty cool , i guess since telsa does n't emit emissions theyd re able to rest them indoors safely"
21716,"thats actually really responsible with thee environment , i think elon musk is a realy smart man , hs sacrifices a lot of money for the company"
21717,"yea , musk must be super rich to take pay 78 million paycut to hi tesla salary"
21718,"he must eb taking a paycut like that one , id didnt knot toyota owned a par of tesla"
21719,"me neither , i also had no clue tesla help develop the rave 4 evh"
21720,"elon musk also founded paypal and spacex ,"
21721,"i knew musk founded space x but did n't know he also founded paypal , he must be worth billions for paypal alone"
21722,"yeah nad las tesla motor , all 3 of them must be worth a lot of money kind of like netflix , a service with 137 million subscribers"
21723,"it 's crazy how big netflix has grown since being founded in 1997 , now it is available worldwide"
21724,"it is crazy , i bet reed hastings and marc randolph didnt had such a big proyect in mind , its now a great of the industry"
21725,yea i bet reed hastings could n't of imagine how big his idea would b easter veins inspired by 40 late fees o is apollo 13 rental
21726,"i can relate to him i got a fine like that one once , i got so angry , its a good thing he started teh service"
21727,"yea , its crazy netflix still mails out movie , they spend 20x on postage as they do on bandwidth"
21728,"it is crazy , i cant believe the still have a rental service , maybe they ill eliminate that one soon"
21729,"it 's shocking tthat blockbuster declined to buy netflix for 50 million several times , they refused to get with the ties"
21730,"they did ? i bet they regret that decision , anyways its been great chatting with yu , hope we can do this again"
21731,"you too , love a great day"
21732,"hi , how o you like tesla ?"
21733,"i 've never driven or ridden in one , but i have to admit that they 're pretty sleek cars"
21734,"neither have i , and you know , i did not know hey were related to toyota , w ho owns 10 percent of tesla"
21735,"tesla helped develop the 2nd generation rav4ev , whuch i have ridden in before . i 'm more familiar with toyota farms"
21736,i found really cool they could test one of the model indoors because does not produce any emissions !
21737,n't hat the model s ? that would also mean eat it can be parked inside a closed garage
21738,"and it was ; d not do any harm ! i think the founder , elon musk did a great design there !"
21739,"well , he also founded paypal and spacex , so he definitely knows what he 's doing !"
21740,"he has been involved with online banking , aerospace manufacturers , ai technologies , neurological technologies among other things ! !"
21741,i wonder what made him choose to us linux in the model s . there must be a good reason for that
21742,"he is not conventional , for example he thik a large paycut on his tesla salary , out of 78 million he returned everything except for 1"
21743,"but i 'm sure it was worth it , whatever ther season . he seems like the kind of guy who takes big risks for something he thinks will pay off in the future"
21744,he is not tied to the conventional . i would like to see the vertical tradeoff electrical passenger jet h wants to build
21745,"not just tat , but i wonder what is longterm plan is when it comes to mars colonization . a heavy lift rocket would be nice , but there 's a lot more that would need to eb invented for tha type of colonization"
21746,it looks like he is seriously thinking about that . i would at to stay oj earth definetely
21747,"oh , definitley ! i do n't know what you wife looks like , but she was in the movie inception"
21748,"i remember her and the movie as well , it is amazing . it looks like he acted too in ' thank you for smoking ' , i have not seen that one"
21749,"i 've never heard of that one , but i 'm surprised that someone who is that much into it having emissions would be in something with tha thiel"
21750,"he even have time for boring stuff , he founded teh boring company !"
21751,roe she even sleep ? he ads all the energy to pursue all these different ideas
21752,it was nice talking to you ! good bye
21753,how 's it going ? do you keep up wth the world cup ? paolo guerreo scored the game wining goal for peru against new zealand
21754,"i ' love to go to peru . not to see the fifa world cup , but to see the land . america always does good in the world can , i think ."
21755,"i know france typically does wel in te world cup , i think they won the most recent one"
21756,i hear they 've held the fifa world cup in russia . i wonder if it was snowing when they were playing . seems chess might ' a more reasonable game . . . or mockery !
21757,"seems that way , i wonder how tampa would play in russia after playing in orlando city"
21758,you mean at the football game he might eels the effects of changing climate and net flag and alot hat ?
21759,"yea , i wonder how all the teams from places like costa rica and the middle east will fare"
21760,i 've heard elevation really can make a difference in how sports players get on . i wonder if the association for football will ever get involved to be sur players can be ok ? maybe they do already ?
21761,i do n't know but they should . i heard the city 's quatar hosting the 2022 world cup does n't even exist yet
21762,"wow , that 's not that far away ! gwen doe 'the fifa world cup decide when it will be help ?"
21763,it 's awarded every four year since 1930
21764,that 's so many years ! i just live how they say gooooooooooooal !
21765,"yea but they make a lot of money , more than football , basketball , golf . and tennis combined"
21766,"i like to play chess mode honda football , but mostly because i don ' 6 want a head injury . i 'm crazy enough without that , too !"
21767,"i have n't played chess much , apparently there are more moves than atoms in the universe , sounds untrue to me"
21768,"i 've tried to be good at chess for years , but did n't start playing still i was a teenager . i 'd try to come up with strategy moves but i always end up being th on who is checkmates ."
21769,"i was never good at chess , apparently there 's a negative correlation between iq and the highest skilled players"
21770,i newer knew until recently that chess was invented in india . i 'd like to bo to india and play chess . . . but maybe a fe hundreds or event thousands of years ago back in the .
21771,"well at least before the 7th century , that 's a lot og games of chess played"
21772,"well , its not about chess being new hen i play it but more about having much less pollution than there is now . stories i 've heard make india seem like it was a paradise years ago ."

21778,yeah but the hungary national team in had one defeat between 1950 and 1956 . so winning was a part . but living ? not so much .
21779,"21 world cup tournaments as been won by 8 teams , it is most prestigious tournament of the world ."
21780,what about chess tournaments ?
21781,"chess is a two player strategy board game played o nchessboard , chess id believed to be originated in india ."
21782,we need a chaturanga championship tournament .
21783,"yes , some of the eastern strategy games xiangqi , janggi and shogun . chess reached the european countries in 9th century ."
21784,but soccer darkest more han all hte major us sports combined . how much cash doe chess bring in ?
21785,in 20th century computers have been programmed to play chess with increasing success . which list make the game very popular all over the world .
21786,but are there economic gain for countries that host chess tournaments ? there are n't for the world cup .
21787,hte best palmer can awarded specific lifetime title by the world chess organization . grand master tilted is highest .
21788,"if chess was really invented by aliens , then a better title is i border ."
21789,it is very interesting .

21791,"yes , chess is indoor game but soccer is outdoor both are totally diff4etn ."
21792,"yeah , i doubt jon stewart can play chess ."

21796,"much better now that guerrero is back . . . so they say . i am with you , the sis closer to my heart . although r world cup is popular ."
21797,apparently the connection is well ratings . the player ranking system for chess has been applied to world cup games .
21798,nice . too bad th efail players ca n't ride on those little horses they use in the .
21799,that woudl look a lo alike polo . i would like some one to shout 'gooooolll ! ' when i make a good move in ceases .

21802,"i like the idea that pawns each used o have their own names , based on commoner occupations . mcdonald 's drive through attenrdajnt takes kings bishops . nice ."
21803,i have never heard that . is that something like rock paper lizard spook ? there are more possible move in and games of chess than atoms in the known universe .
21804,"and with a style where they players can play simultaneously , i can be taken with any of those movies time at the same time !"
21805,car wash squeeze meant cakes takes queens book . the president of the world chess federation believes acess was invetend any aliens . . . .
21806,stable boy wrestlers work away from squeeze man . i wonder if chaturanga was this much fun ?
21807,i bet it was . people in india like a good game . i wonder if the pieces were kind of like gods or just animals . elephant scooped moves forward two spaces . ;
21808,i wonder how different shogun is from chess ? bishops slides through remain so fact the elephant scooped missed .
21809,i have no idea about shogun . chess rewatched europe by the ' century . school lunch lady advances one space .
21810,pieces assumed their current powers in spain in the late 15th century . proctologist 's assistant move in behind queens janitor .
21811,lol . the rules were standardized in the 19th century . chernjobyl janitor moves to the eighth rank o the board and becomes a queen .
21812,"nice . not bad for a bunch of rocks on a 80 board ! tip quality control assistant has the kings ear , influences next move ."
21813,"there is a negative correlation between iq and acess skill ins strong players . t weather man opens window and states they obvious , moves forward one space ."
21814,"the superbowl is smaller thant he third biggest fifa event , but still much bigger than a pawn ."

21816,there was only one 1g cup in world cup history that ended in a way tie . i lay down my king and genuflect at your feet .
21817,do you follow it soccer at all ?
21818,i do ! i was o happy to see france win the world cup again . long wait few the next one now .
21819,i thin they women play this year ? right ?
21820,oh yea that 's right . should tide me over . the kids for the 2022 world cup were pretty crazy . did yo see what countries swede offering ?
21821,"yeah , and they chose qatar ."
21822,it ; s a good choice but japan would have been cool . they were going to project 3d holograms soft he games ! beats 4k for sure .
21823,"that is crazy , that would definitely et , m vote"
21824,hopefully it wil be cool enough in qatar . it gets very hot there .
21825,"well , seeing as they havent even built the city that will host the final , they might be building same super cool indoor stadiums or something ."
21826,"yes with a nd al l , however with things like this hey never tend to go as planned . they still have time but for them at least i imagine time will fly by fast ."
21827,it always does . it is a shame no place ever really profits off voting in the long run
21828,they ca n't with today 's security roasts . really it should just be played at the same place every time or at least every other time . it 's crazy to think that the superbowl is smaller hen soccers 3rd largest event .
21829,"the super bowl doesnt involve a lot of people , so many people follow soccer in the world"
21830,"yeah african football just does n't have worldwide appeal . the people who do casually watch , w match for the commercials . soccer his played in over 200 countries so everyone grows up with it ."
21831,"that is tru e , it does even make more money taht many other sports combined ."
21832,it probably helps you do n't need much equipment to play either . you do need to be in shape though . soccer players run an average of 7 miles per game !
21833,thats why i always played keeper . far less running !
21834,"yes ! do you play chess as well ? i did it very challenging when you are matched up with someone who is equally skill , ed ."
21835,"i con a , but i am not very good . i cant see many moves ahead like some people can ."
21836,maybe you should try 3 person chess . there is a special board that allows 3 peopel to play all at once .
21837,i dont know about that . . . sounds like aliens might have invented that . . .
21838,lol . i 'm not sure about the 3 person version but current chess boards were invented in spain in the 15th century but the games best all the way back to before the 7th century !
21839,according to the president of the world chess federation it was invented by aliens .
21840,are you sure that was n't a joke ? i think i 'll go look into that . it was nice chatting with you .
21841,you never know . have a great night !
21842,what entertainment o you enjoy ?
21843,"i liked horror movies , like the exorcist ."
21844,spot is horror your favorite genre ?
21845,"i do n't think so . i think drama may be my favorite genre , bt i do love some horror movies . i mentioned thee exorcist because it is legitimately one of my favorites . i recently learned that during hte filming of the movie , no one thought it was a horror film . that 's funny ."
21846,for me horror is usually ah it or miss . i personally enjoy drams since it brings depth to a story either through tragedy or comedy
21847,"yes , a lot of horror does n't interest me . i lke some old slasher movies from the 80s tough . what ' sour favorite dramatic movie ?"
21848,i thunk horror films are very subjective . you can even consider bambi to be one
21849,"the destruction too the environment , the death of close loved ones . . . pretty horrific , but seems more like a drama to me ! poor bambi . tell me why you think bambi could eb a horror movie ! interested to hear our thoughts on that one ."
21850,"i mega far a little kid , seeing death is quite traumatic"
21851,"yes , learning about death as a little kid can be terrifying , and a movie like that might stick it you for a long time . learning about death is part of learning about the universe though , and it kind it 's pretty important ."
21852,"true , but how much will we ever really know about the universe ?"
21853,good question . . . i ca n't claim to know much about it other has that it 's a crazy mystery . i think it 's trippy thinking about the idea tat our universe could exist inside cop a black hole . it 's like that movie inception or something .
21854,it is also hard to comprehend free is a region of space pulling galaxies outside the observable universe
21855,"yea that stuff blown my mind . i ca n't really comprehend it . also interesting that black holes apparently emit super low sound waves that humans ca detect , not with their was , but still , ."
21856,imagine if everything is one big superhologram ?
21857,right ? i remember reading recently that elon musk from tesla thinks hat it 's possible we live in one giant simulation . reminds em of the tetris . it 's not too outrageous a thought when you learn how crazy th universe is .
21858,i mean there is even a theory that is only 1 electron in the universe . i ca n't even understand what that means
21859,"same here . i find our think of that cgi animation at the end of men in black where the camera zoom out frame garth adn our universe to the point where it all become sa marble that is being played with by so , e galactic minster . it 's actually kind of a comforting thought that the universe is so strange . . . it makes little things that happen in my life seem less weird ."
21860,"i found it interesting how in the men in black , the galaxy was a marble"
21861,i love that movie . the sequels were n't so great in my opinion though . have you seen them ?
21862,"yes i found them to eb decent . in any case , thanks for hvcatting ."
21863,do you know if astro was hurt by toys r us ?
21864,"it definetly was , toys r us was one of the biggest toy stores in the us and it closed its doors so that definitely affected the sales of many companies"
21865,what other companies could fill in hte void left by toys r us ?
21866,"companies such as amazon , wallmart and even target are good options , what are your thoughts on these companies ?"
21867,it is hard o say . only about a third of the lost volume has been made up .
21868,"i guess theres more to it than just a great intermidiat e , im sad about the workforce shortage the company has to make ."
21869,true . astro is expected to lost up to 60 million in severance .
21870,"thats a lot of , they , so changing the subject a bit did you happen to see the movie frozen ?"
21871,i thought it wasa a good adaptation of the snow queen fairy dale .
21872,"it was pretty good , my daughter loved the movie , star wars is also another good franchise , both own by disney now"
21873,true . did you know arya lucas is responsible for many iconic star wars moments .
21874,"behind every great man there is a great woman , i guess this phrase applies to george lucas and i didnt know that but it doesnt surprise me either ."
21875,"then again , james early jones is great , but he only made 7500 for his iconic broke in star wars ."
21876,"only 700 somone defintely got ripped of , kind of like fox with george lucas , although it was all because the lack of faith cost he network in the franchise"
21877,"you know who did n't get ripped off ? amazon 's first customer , who spent 27 . 59 and had a building named after him !"
21878,n't sure is a bargain 27 . 95 or having a building named after you an plus you also get merchandise from the company
21879,are . they are tough negotiations . they even got a contract for sunday deliveries with the usps !
21880,"wow , i bet amazon is one of the ew companies tc ahve a contract like that one , you know they have a patent on the 1click buying option"
21881,i heard that fact . amazing what can be accomplished in less than 25 years !
21882,"i know right , in most 25 years amazon has placed its of the top of the world even higher than companies such as larget and walmart"
21883,true ! thanks for the chat . i think i will go red something on my kindle !
21884,do you like toys r us ?
21885,"i used to , a lot . do you like them ?"

21894,"your right ut i 'm happy that a woman fill finally get some credit , you know ?"
21895,i agree ! i wish more women got more chances . us white guys really take up too many chances .
21896,yeah but do n't blame yourself society has it set up that say . some one had a building named after them for being the first customer on amazon .
21897,"they spent like 30 for a building named after them . it does n't matter what they bought , htey got a name on a building !"
21898,"right i wonder what building it was . if you want to lose some eight you should get a job in their warehouse , lol . 715 miles a shift ."
21899,they hold the patent for 1click buying . apples pays them a licensing fee . i ha no idea !
21900,"me either , this guy is a genius , im impressed . they also have s contract with usps ."
21901,heir arrow many they have everything from a to z
21902,yup and they do . so they bought imdb in 1998 . ? he 's trying to take over the world he should just run for president .

21909,"yeah that 's right t , books like htey were ow 07 percent n revenues in hte us and canada ."
21910,and 24 percent internationally . they should have seen the amazon monster coming for him !
21911,yeah jeff should run for president .
21912,it would be interesting . he owns a lot so he has the platform .
21913,i remember toys r us as a kid . they embedded christmas . lol !
21914,"that catalog ! i went into my local stored hen they were closing , just to look around . and it was dead ! everything was gone and it was symbolic of my childhood at that point . i was so sad ."
21915,too funny ! apparently they owe hasve 50m last september .
21916,woops ! that 's a lot to have to write off or down . man !
21917,yeah ! have you ever seen frozen it was written by the first women for a disney film .
21918,i have seen that . i had no idea it was originally called snow queen .
21919,yeah it 's a 1913 american 3d computer animated musical fantasy film .
21920,"htey have had a animated feature films ! ? ! ? ! ? ! wow , i thought it was in 325 ."
21921,the first female director names was jennifer lee . good for her i wonder if she has any other works .
21922,she might know need to work again since froze brought in 1b !
21923,i know that 's awesome . they renamed rapunzel alto tangled because it was too feminine and they thought it would not do as well .
21924,did youse very see brave ? that movie was great ! i love how thay did her hair .
21925,yes i have to say i saw that one too . had tudyk has had a role in every disney it since wreck it ralph .
21926,"wow , hr must be important . it has been nice chatting with you !"
21927,good morning to you ! how are you today
21928,good mongering ! i 'm doing well unlike toys r us . it 's a sham the filed for bankruptcy .
21929,"i know , sims till upset about that one . astro is blaming their 7 percent holiday drop on toys r us closing"
21930,"i guess tha tit is possible . i 've heard that astro is going to build a warehouse in the , midwest to improve their shipping times . maybe ethan will help ."
21931,yea their analyst sat da davidson think that sould be their best to it i think it coudl help with shipping costs o retailers
21932,maybe that will improve their bottom line . did you know taht toys r us owed astro around 59 million last september ?
21933,thats a ton of money and probably not the only people they owed money to sadly . the astro brand covered some of the biggest licensed brands so its not surprising
21934,"you know , i think that if toys r us had lowered it 's prices some they might stil , l be in business . they were just too high priced compared to walmart and amazon ."
21935,both soo high priced and far too less convenient than shopping from hoe on amazon
21936,i agree with that . amazon is the largest internet retailer i nthe world .
21937,"with one of them is unique founders n the old , jeff bezos ."
21938,"he i sr it you know eh built a clock into a mountain that should last for 10 , 000 years ? the question there is , why ?"
21939,yup napa that 's what i was referring to wen i wa playing he was unique . is he has bored ? that 's crazy . amazon has exploded in growth since btw as founded i 1994
21940,"it really has . i have to admit , whenever i want to buy something amazon is the first place i think of ."
21941,i thnk that 's the case for almost everyone these days . they have so mush stuf that warehouse workers tend to walk 715 miles every single shift
21942,"well , i'ts good exercise and good pay from what i hear . you know you are an important business though when the post office agrees to deliver our stuff on sundays !"
21943,they do that ? i thought the post offices were always closed on sundays ?
21944,"i did too , but i guess it foray amazon ."
21945,thats crazy . almost as crazy as he first sale on amazon being for a building for 27 . 95 . can you imagine being the guy who did that ?
21946,that guy had to be either very trusting or very crazy lol ! i wonder what building it was !
21947,me too ! all i know is that i bet he 's any he made that risk way bake then
21948,"hello , how are you ?"
21949,"i 'm great , you ?"
21950,"pretty goo d , do you like music ?"
21951,"absolutely , wo does n't ?"
21952,"yeah , some more than others . ed sheeran has a great vocal range !"
21953,"i really enjoy listening to ed sheeran , i 've listened to every album ."
21954,"really that 's interesting . yes , i do too ! h e couch surfed for 2 1 or 2 years between gigs ."
21955,"yeah , o love thye fact he is influenced by eminem , which is a true inspiration ."
21956,"yes , interesting lady tags has four names ."
21957,wow really ?
21958,"three girl names , stefani joanne angelina ."
21959,"that is really pretty . i remember listening to her before she was famous . lady gaga is soc lose with elton john , he made her the god mother ton is son ."
21960,"really , that 's nice . pink floyd still got one of the best selling albums of 2014 ."
21961,"that i amazing , they ar such a old group , i 'm surprised so many people still listen to the . speaking of older groups , lady gaga 's favorite band is iron maiden ."
21962,"i know , and that surprises me about lady gaga ! did you see the grammys this year ?"
21963,i watcher a little bit of it .
21964,"i misses did , i did see some parts the next day . like tow patched the before show interviews ."
21965,i believe there was a controversy about womans not winning some categories .
21966,"ye s , i see that . ny times stated only 9 percent of nominees have been women ."
21967,it 's in of ridiculous because the women this year have released better music than most men . at least in my opinion .
21968,"i now , crazy . justin biebers song ' love yourself ' was written by ed sheeran ."
21969,"ifr remember etc sheeran talking about this , i think it 's cool ."
21970,"omg , no twins at 100 years old released a rap album in japan . lol"
21971,"oh my goodness , that is crazy ! lol anyway , it was nice talking to you , i 've got o get some sleep . hav a goodnight !"
21972,you too !
21973,"thanks , bye !"
21974,"hi , do you like lady saga ?"
21975,yes ! i love lady gaga .
21976,did you know that er real name eis stefani joanne angelina germanotta ?
21977,"i think i know her name i stefani . i had no idea that whe has two middle dances . joanne , rib believe , was the name of her grandmother ."
21978,"that 's cool . i heard she first began performing as a teenager , singing wat open mic nights and acting in school plays . what 's your favorite gaga song ?"
21979,i did not now she did school plays . i think my favorite son gigs actually the song named after her grandmother called ' joanne ' . do you have a favorite song by her ? are you a fan ? ?
21980,"i became a pretty big fan in 2008 when her first album , the way was released and contained poker face and id yu see that new movie she is in with bradley cooper ?"
21981,i can not believe that album was nearby ten years go . i hav no seen it . i did see they won a grammy for the song shadow ' the other night . i think that is the name of the song anyway .
21982,"you 're right l , that was the name of the song . the movie is very good too , you should definitely see it . it 's funny that lady gaga got her name from a predictive text glitch that changed ' radio ' o ' ; lady '"
21983,this is what everyone keeps telling me . i enjoy bradley cooper so i think i woudl like the movie . i ma relaly glad that she went wit heady gave ' and not radio gaga ' . . . .
21984,"yeah , it definitely would n't have he the ring to it . it 's interesting that she became so popular that the lapd asked for her assistance . they asked her to tweet to he 11 . 4 million follower about information torn some upcoming road more so the word would get out faster ."
21985,i read chat ! good thing some celebrity influence fun do some good . . . if that is considered good lol i did n't know elton john hader any childrens . not surprised that lady same is the godmother .
21986,that 's cool she 's elton 's son 's godmother . . . does lady gaga have any children of her own ? it 's funny that she was on mtv 's ' boiling points ' before anyone ever knew she was going to be famous
21987,"no , she does not have any of her own children . i wonder if i can find that clip od her on boiling points somewhere . would be interesting to see what she looks likes . she had to have been 18 or 19 at was time i would guess ?"
21988,probably so . . . it 's interesting gta many big artists appeared on television shows before they were famous . justin timberlake and whitney sears wee both on the mickey moose club when they were much younger .
21989,i remember reading about whitney sears and justin timberlake being on the ticket mouse club when they were children . ryan boiling was on there as well !
21990,"do you think ed sheeran was on any tv shows before he was famous ? i did n't realize he had written ' love yourself ' but gave it away to justin bieber , lol ."
21991,if he has been it was definitely in the
21992,it 's weird that eminem is one of ed 's biggest musical influences . . . ther musical styles could n't be any more different .
21993,it was definitely in the uk . i do n't know what happened there . ed sheeran ha that to have written for many people . i would never have guessed eminem for one of his musical influences . that is strange !
21994,definitely strange . . . nice talking to you !
21995,"hi , how ar eyou ?"
21996,good this morning ! yourself ? did you watch the grammys ?
21997,i did not . i am not a huge awards sow person a what about you ? did you watch them ?
21998,i did . i was really disappointed that mesh and sofa were snubbed . i thought they would get some kind of nod .
21999,i know mesh but not a . do you know sia ?
22000,"sia sings r and b . she is pretty good . when the grammy guy was asked why more women were n't dominated , he blamed women , not a good move ."
22001,seems like he was thinking responsibility for sexism .
22002,"it sure looks like it l although he did make a good point . if women want to b recognized , theyd o have o step up and make tshirt voices heard ."
22003,"mesh sue wher producer for sexual assault and despite the evidence , he was let off . seems like she is not getting justice in either arena . . ."
22004,that is so true . i lived her video ti too too . sing it almost every day even if it is silly . i thought lady gaga would at least be mentioned for her music in that film she did it bradley cooper .
22005,her super bowl leap was crazy . did you see that last year ?
22006,no ! i 'll have to look that up . i guess lorde was pretty ticked off t the grammy 's too . they would n't let her sing .
22007,i do think they should add hte most tone deaf spoke word statement award . so many white males woulda e nominated !
22008,"they would ! i guess ed sheeran won for tbi year ! : ,"
22009,i like him . . . do n't tell my judgment friends . . .
22010,": , i do too . he makes loving music . fun stuff . did you see the white roses everyone ore to the grammy 's by far chance ?"
22011,i did not ; what did they signify ?
22012,the time 's up initiative . a legal fund set up the victims of sexual harassment ! huge support for it .
22013,speaking of white males . . . i found or find that whole movement disappointing necessary . ca n't people just act right ?
22014,"neat would be nice , but men ahve run the industry for so long , they think it ? s their privilege . do you ever listen to lady gaga ?"
22015,i hae in the past . do you listen to her ?
22016,not too much . i watched her video with bradley cooper last night . she is so much prettier without a the make up . i watched her q little in american horror story . was really over the top .
22017,nice chanting it you !
22018,do you1 ike keys ' personally i think shes a great artist with a lot of talent
22019,"ya i do like her , cant ' believe she was snubbed last year at the grammy"
22020,"yeah and also ed sheeran had a controversial win , not sure if he deserved that ."
22021,"ya i ca n't say i agree , do you like lady gaga btw ?"
22022,"yeah i do , not only as a singer but shes also a great actress , what about you ? d o you like her ?"
22023,"ya she does a good job , . i guess she was born back in 1986 which . one year younger than me haha"
22024,"uses a young artist , she has a lot to give , , any singles , many mcvies to come ."
22025,"y i coul she that , it funny she got her na , me from a predictive text glitch that changed radio to lady"
22026,it is funny just like how hte lapd asked her to tweet info about an upcoming roadwork in teh town
22027,"ya that was funny , also cool is elton john who chosen add gaga to be in son 's godmother , thats cool"
22028,"thats interesting , did you ever watch the shoe boiling poiting son mtv ?"
22029,"nope never heard of it , that is it about ?"
22030,"its a show that used to read on mtv it was like a reality tv kind of show , well lady gaga was o nit"
22031,"oh i see , ya i like her early hits lke poker facet nd just dance i think those were some og herbs est songs"
22032,"those are great songs , i like the as well , lady gaga has a favorite band , not the less than iron maiden ."
22033,"wow hat is crazy the music is com ; politely different , and ya she was sold over 27 million albums and 150 million singles , shes one of the best selling artists in teh history of music"
22034,yeah they have like completely opposite styles bust like ed sheeran kite eminem as one of his biggest influences .
22035,"h that i interesing , he also has a better vocal range than freddie mercury which i crazy"
22036,"thats suprising since freddie mercury had a really great and unique voice , ed sheeran is a great artist but mercury is in another league ."
22037,"ya i agree , nothing ed has made touches freddie 's stuff , although it was nice that ed gave the songs a yourself to bieber to sing"
22038,"yeah that was a nice thing to do , i guess they must be really good friends , sheeran had a rough road to becoming thur artist eh is now"
22039,"ya k sound like he did , had to couch surf for 2 years and sleep outside , that sounds rough"
22040,yeah it souds that way
22041,do you like pop music ?
22042,"is ok , did you know most pop hits use the same 4 chords"
22043,"yes , very interestin g , you can do a lot with 4 chords . did you know that in a 2012 study they found out that pop music has grown louder and more musically homogeneous since the mkd6o0 's ? i believe that accounts fo 'the 4 cord harmony ."
22044,"probably , i do like ' we are the champions ' , which is considered the catchiest pop song of all time"
22045,pop music it part of our culture nd other cultures as well . the president of indonesia released 3 pop albums while in office .
22046,"funny , must not be too busy being president . i dead that some pop record labels send out rejection matters that start witty ' dear loser '"
22047,"ha , no doubt . still pop music is ' popular ' . ricky gervais wa sa pop singer in the 80 's . and , north korea eve bias its own kpop girl band named the ' moranbong band ' which i see most popular music group in their country ."
22048,"wow , how about the beatles , regarded as one of the most influential bands in history"
22049,the beatles were cool . they started beatlemania back in the 60 's and they became integral to teh pop music evolution add helped turn it into the sport form that it is today .
22050,"nice , they broke in 1970 before any of them were even 30"
22051,"yes , they had political interests good . another interesting fact is taht the beatles 's song ' come together ' was written for timothy leary ' 1969 california governor campaign ."
22052,"interesting , and the used the word love 63 times in their songs !"
22053,"yes , the beatles are known fort hat although none soft he beatles could actually read music . on top of that , they literally stopped touring because back in the day you could n't hear that over the screaming in the audience ."
22054,"icy an imagine , and no touring needed , aerosmith made more money from guitar hero then any album"
22055,"yes , the beatles have a guitar hero as as well . funny , another strange thing i found out was hat ringo starr wa illiterate for most of his childhood because he missed three years of school becase he had tuberculosis and peritonitis ."
22056,"did not know that , walt disney did double track vocals 10 years before the beatles did"
22057,"the beats ran the gamer touch . they went from 50 's type rock adn roll to pop ballads and then to indian music and finally to psychedelic and hard rock . and , all the while they incorporated classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways ."
22058,"quote resourceful , people stop traffic atl recreate beatles image at abbey road too"
22059,"cool . yes , abbey road was one of their best albums . they even have he best selling album of the 2000 's . apparently par of taht ' beatlemania ' carries on in today 's world ."
22060,"definitely , nic chatting"
22061,same here . have a good one .
22062,are you a fan of pop music ?
22063,i do like pop music . also jazz and rock . how about you ?
22064,"i love pop music , especially the late 90s earl 00s ! in as been around since the 50s"
22065,do you like 80s pop ? it has a distinct sound . i think that it is popular witht the kids now because it is nostalgic .
22066,"i do n't know if i ever heard of that king . i only heard music from ricky gervais in the 80s , that was interesting !"
22067,there are many wonderful pop songs from that like . you can find them on youtube . impress your friends wish your knowledge of ancient pop .
22068,"i will have to look them up . i heard most korea has its own pop style , that would be interesting to listen to !"
22069,i think that nk must have a pretty bad kind of pop . probably syrupy and stuff . i bet the sing about the dead leader .
22070,for sure and then cry about it lol ! do you have any favorite albums ?
22071,no favorite albums . i usually listen to songs on youtube . i do like some jazz albums on there i guess . what about you ?
22072,"i likd linkin parks hybrid theory , that bet selling album in the 21st century . i also liked the beatles albums , but now yes i listen to on youtube a lot now"
22073,lp idea a great album . they deserve to be 1 . too bad about their singer .
22074,"right , sad that people battle those demons . were you a fan of nwa"
22075,"i was not a can , but they sure could spit mad fire ."
22076,"for sure , they released their album and it became platinum without major air play or tours !"
22077,"they newt hat she streets was hungry for some reason beats , relax truth . they did no need to market reality to the people ."
22078,"for sure , they coined f the police i think , great song though . almost as good as he songs made by 2 2010 year old twins from japan ."
22079,i it to hear what those twins released . it must eb about arthritis and stuff .
22080,"lol , and a lot of black pain and back in my days ! lol ! great chatting with yo !"

22117,aha yes thats the one . also the zebra fish shares 4 percent of genes known to be associated with human disease .
22118,"if they are that closely related maybe the have the capacity to play chess ? of course , we are back to them not having limbs and fingers , so maybe not ."
22119,ha ha yeah i would like to know more about that . some people actually believe that ceases was created by aliens .
22120,"those people are probably more closely related to the zebra fish taht just 4 percent . i understand it came from india , it mars ."
22121,very intresting . there was one a chess grandmaster who beat somebody without even looking at the board . that would be embarrassing .
22122,"i might be the one on the losing side . i used to ahve a computer chess set when i was a id . i figure out how to cheat it , so never really learned anything from it , aside fro mow to cheat ."
22123,oh interesting i would be curious to know how people cheat . there are more possible moves in a game of chess than they are atoms in the known universe .
22124,"i know , there 's this story of the invention of teh game , ad how th creator asked for a grain of rice ron be double every square of the board . by the time you get to the last square here is more rice than exists . have a good day ."

22132,i wouldnt ' want to mess with them ! they are 98 percent water so i 'm sure its easy to evaporate in the u n !
22133,i bet ! freshwater fish only rink through their skin via osmosis while saltwater fish drink water through their mouths .
22134,that is one interesting fact ! can you believe there was af ish that lived for 226 year ? i wonder how many owners it had ?
22135,that is pretty cool ! i 've heard koi fish can live a long time . a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck !
22136,you would guess there would be others but i guess not ! so what kind of computer do you own ?
22137,i have a personal computer . they are in so many devices now it ' crazy .

22146,hello do you like taylor swift ?
22147,"hey there ! i n tolerate taylor swift , s he 's bot my favorite or anything , what about you ? did you know that she 'll walk backwards so taht her picture ca n't be taken by paparazzi ?"
22148,"i like her music , i dont know much about her . that is pretty funny and probably effective !"
22149,yesh i could see it being effective . do you knw wo olaf the snowman is ? the one from the movie frozen ? u guess she dressed up as him on tour haha hat 's pretty funny
22150,"wow thats awesome , yes i love olaf lol taylor swift accidently re ; erased 8 seconds of white noise and topped the canada charts lol"
22151,"haha hat 's funny . that 's some really expensive white noise pol . i guess that she came from a wealthy family too , she lived on a true farm that was about 11 acre in size"
22152,"wow , just be nice !"
22153,"she does seem like she a over though , all the proceeds from her tour called wildest dream to na african wildlife conservation center"
22154,yeah ive heard of her donating to a lot of charities and even others i ended . she gave mesh money to fight her sexual harrassment case too .
22155,"well that 's nice of him . doe sa lot of pop crossovers too , which is cool . it 's also impressive that she started her music career at the age of 14 ."
22156,taylor swift removed her music from spotify because ' music shouldnt be free '
22157,"that 's interesting . yiu like her song that 's called ' our song ' ? apparently she was the youngest person to write and perform a number one country hit , with tha song ,"
22158,"no i havent and of that one , is it good ?"
22159,"no i have n't either . i 'm not a massive fan of hers , but shed hoe seem very talented so i 'll have to check some of her stuff out . do you like any other albums ? not necessarily by her"
22160,"yes absolutely , my favorite right now is bryce vine . 8 hear linkin parks album hybrid theory is the best selling of the 1st centure ."
22161,ok i 'll have to check that ou i what do you think about aerosmith ? apparently they need to money by lending otehr rights to the guitar hero franchise then buy ny kind of record sales lol tthat ' crazy
22162,"i think that was a great idea i my opinion , guitar hero wa sa hit because of their contribution , thats a lot of royalties ."
22163,"ye si agree ! i love playing those games when i was in high school , do you , ike led zeppelin by the way ? i love that they didnt name their fourth album just to mess with the rock press , wish they hated"
22164,i never really listened to their music . thats hilarious .
22165,"youse should check them out , they 're actually really good ! just do n't but ny records at walmart by the way , they only sell clean versions of records , that would really annoy me"
22166,"yeah that is annoying , i wan na hear the music the artist released , not some edited version ."
22167,hey howe 's it going are you a star wars for ? i actually really enjoyed the solo star wars film !
22168,il ike some o they . did you know that al pacino turned down the role of han solo because even could n't understand the script ?
22169,a that 's kind of funny and sad at the same time . i thought ron howard did a good job directing .
22170,i thought he did so too . alien ehrenreich did really good ash a polo .
22171,yeah he was great . i liked the movie because it took place 10 years after ' a new hope ' so it gave some closure .
22172,yeah and that ; s what i fee that series lacks is closure . there 's too many open woods in the story line for me .
22173,yeah it always leaves you hanging . but there were some answered questions . i like how han solo was a tie lighter pilot before rioting the millennia falcon !
22174,yeah and he also was na imperial lieutenant before his companionship ; with chewbacca .
22175,interesting . did you know george lucas originally intended jhn solo to eb a alergy green alien or a black man ?
22176,"that 's pretty interesting , i also considered christopher walker for as he solo ."
22177,oh he would n't be too bad . have you seen deadpool 2 by chance ? i loved ryan reynolds in that !
22178,i loved that movie . did you know that the video game cost more to make than the movie ?
22179,wow how is that even possible ? it is also the highest grossing film of all time not directed by lucy sour clemson !
22180,"that is wild ! in a 2004 comic book series , deadpool described himself as ' ryan reynolds crossed with a sharply , ' this lead reynolds to believe he was destined or the role ."
22181,haha very cool . he really played the role well . he even voiced she mystery villain !
22182,i heard that the screenwriters released has . that 's pretty neat .
22183,very neat indeed . an addition to watching movies i also love to travel ? did you knkow she japanese highway tolls are extremely expensive ? i would hope they have nice roads .
22184,i 've heard that it cost more china 300 to travel across the country . i 'd love they use that money on the roads .
22185,yeah seriously i would hope so . i wonder how much it would cost to ride in those dutch buses that go ip o 160mph ? !
22186,"i 'm not sur e , but i feel it would be worth it ? i wish i had one when i was going on business trips !"
22187,yeah that would have been cool . also i love hawaii and tey had a king who lived to travel too ! nice chatting with you !
22188,"helo , what is your favorite movie ?"
22189,"i really like the movie the godfather . one movie that i think is only ok though is deadpool 2 , did you see that movie"
22190,i have seen dead pool 2 . it is probably my favorite movie of all time ! although i also do really like solo a star wars story
22191,"yeah deadpool 2 came out in 121 , i actually like the first one a lot but did n't really like the second , did you ever play the video game"
22192,"no i have not , although i heard the video game was decent . have you ever played the video game ?"
22193,yes i did . the video game is actually really good ! and shockingly it cost more than the first deadpool movie to make
22194,"that makes sense , as it costs the video game developers al o do money to begin tube graphics , and a lot more to market the fame ."
22195,"do you remember in deadpool to the mystery villain ? apparently ryan reynolds does his voice e , i wonder who the villain is goint o be in deadpool 3 though"
22196,i wonder too . deadpool is the highest grossing r rated film that was not directer by george lucas or james cameron ! no wonder it was so successful
22197,yes i agree . you said hat you like star wars movies right ? dd you now that han solo used to be a tie fighter pilot ?
22198,no i did not ! han solo was apparently also an imperial lieutenant before making up with chewbacca .
22199,"well that is interesting , also george lucas wanted him to eb a large green alien r a black jan originally lol that would have been a very different movie"
22200,i am glad that they chose for him to be a very fuel person . he is one of my favorite star wars characters .
22201,"yep i agree , i love harrison ford , what if they chose christopher walked though ? he was in the running for it"
22202,i wonder what woudl have happened then . maybe we should just be happy tat the things are the way they are because the movie turned out to be excellent t .
22203,"yes w totally should . al ot of things came together well because if you was available , for instance al pacino turned down an solo 's role because he did n't understand the script that would have been totally different too"
22204,it wold have been very different . do you think that we will ever be in a world similar to that of star wars ?
22205,"no i do n't think so , that world is too fanatical i think , what do you think ? i would like to travel to outer space thouhg"
22206,speaking of travelling . did you know tht all od japans highways have tolls ? it would cost over 300 to travel across japan !
22207,"yeah hat sounds expensive , it would eb fun to see that dutch bus 160 miles per hour on those road so lol ."
22208,i wonder if there had been may accidents 20th tbone buses because 160 mph does not sound very safe !
22209,"no thats definitely really fast . maybe i ' l take a trip to mackinac island though , they do n't have buses or any kinds of cars for that matter , only horses"
22210,"i tell you , this taylor swift is a magnet for controversy ."
22211,"ahh ? . you know , haters gon na hate ! lol . seriously though , yeah , i heard she being sued !"
22212,at least its not kanye west suing . i heard he mocked himself ons nl .
22213,"really ? i dod n't see that ep . course , i have n't watched snl in a good abide . i did recently do a bunch of ' weekend update ' clips on youtube though . norm mcdonald is hilarious !"
22214,"yea h , he made fun of himself fo interrupting taylor a an award shot ."
22215,"yeah , i remember that happening . . . where wa star , the tv wares ? you know what 's weird ? taylor swift often walks backwards to keep from setting her pic taken . i bet the paparazzi love test ."
22216,whoa . i could always fly away from them in her dassault falcon 900 jet .
22217,"i have to admit , as sappy a it is , i do find ' you being with me ' a rather catchy song ."
22218,i would like to hear nwa do that . maybe put it on a rerelease of straight outta compton
22219,"get the feeling they 'd add in a lot ore swear words . lol . speaking of which , did you know walmart only sells ' clean ' versions of albums ? found that kind of interesting . ."
22220,wow . remind em not to shop at walmarts . . . unless i 'm buying a rap album made by 100 year old japanese twins
22221,there 's a rap album by 100 year old twins ? what are some of the songs on it ?
22222,lol ! it 's almost as top as the 8 second white noise taylor swift once released .
22223,speaking o albums . . . you a bi glued zeppelin fan ?
22224,"yah . i like her and 70s or in general . 8 hear pink floyd 's dark side of teh moon was a bestseller in 2014 , believe it or not . ,"
22225,"i just think it 's funny how he did n't title any of the first four albums . i 've heard the did that just to many age rock press . , along with once releasing n labour under w different band name . . . ,"
22226,what name did they release an album under ? linkin park ?
22227,"no , it was a bunch ot weird symbols and stuff . i do n't know what i was ' unofficial ' called . but from what i understand , they did it to prove it was n't just the ' brand name ' tthat was bringing in fans ."
22228,maybe they crashed the rock press party by announcing hey just recorded what ha to be th best album of all time !
22229,"you mentioned dark side of th mon earlier . . speaking of albums with staying power , legend by bob marley has been on the album chart for over 914 weeks ! i find that pretty amazing !"
22230,whoa ! . i ? m going to go jamming now . nice chatting .
22231,"hi , do you like taylor swift ?"
22232,i am not af an . i 'm not a ' hate ' but i just never develope dan appetite for her work . i would rather play monopoly . . . you ?
22233,now i do n't really like her music . i saw an west did an snl skit mocking himself for his interruption to swift .
22234,"interesting guy that kanye . . . have you heard any of his albums ? not as creative as thom yorke playing his laptop on a radiohead also , but still petty creative nonetheless !"
22235,he 's very interesting . i have not heard much of his music . swift owns a falcon 900 jet that cost 40 million .
22236,"poor girl . . . could n't afford a bigger plane . . . maybe she will write a sad song bacon tit . . . until then we will just ahve to listen to legend by marley , on the charts for over 900 weeks !"
22237,lol . she once released 8 seconds pf white noise and topped the canadian itunes charts with it . ; . . ol !
22238,"it must have been since in canada , where everything is white anyway ! i wonder if walmart sells that ' hit ? ' they only sell clean music !"
22239,lol . that 's interesting about walmart . i did see linkin park
22240,they were quite popular . i do n't know if they made any games thouhg . aerosmith mad more money with guitar her than from any album .
22241,guitar hero was huge so i can see that happening . reel big fish once rerecorded all of their albums because they lost the rights to their old record company .
22242,at least they are willing to work for it ! taylor swift dresses dump like nola when she was on tour during the halloween season . that 's working the crowd !
22243,that 's working the crowd for sure ! two identical twins in japan once released a rap album at 100 years old .
22244,"cool ! i wonder if swift will still be holding concert sat 100 ? she probably will still have to walk backwards to avoid being photographed , . ."
22245,i bet so . do you like the game monopoly ?
22246,"sure ! i may fill eb playing a game i started two week ago . . . long game . . . nicolas cage convinced johnny depp to become an actor while playing monopoly , so i am keeping my option open !"
22247,wow that ' interesting and good to know . i saw it was originally intended to be a teaching tool about injustices of capitalism .
22248,ironic chow much more the game has made since then ? another sad irony : nearly every top mcdonalds monopoly prize from 19952000 was fraudulently won by some considers . . . send them directly to jail and do not pass go !
22249,haha that 's a good point . i 've always liked playing the game .
22250,"did you know that the orange properties are the best ones , statistically speaking ?"
22251,"i did not know that . well , it was good talking to you !"
22252,do you lke to read ?
22253,i love literature ! i was just reading a fact about how there is an annual contest or writers aoc ome up with the worst opening line in a novel !
22254,that is funny . id o n't read a lot but apparently a lot of adults do . over half of adults have library cards .
22255,"oh tat 's too bad , books re like living in another life , i am always reading something ! il oven he library to it has everything under one roof . you can even get cd 's and movies there !"
22256,in sacramento you can even rent sewing machines and othe things that you do n't need to own long term . i coul definitely see myself using that library .
22257,haha ! wow i didnt ' know that . definitely want to go there lol . . . . . . there are more libraries in the us than mcdonalds ! that 's a lot .
22258,"ep , libraries are pretty important , especially to uk prime minister william gladstone . he founded his own public library and wheelbarrowed his 32 , 000 books ot he library himself . he was 85 !"
22259,"what t ! that 's awesome ! i agree though they are important . i heard in norway if you publish a book the government buys 1000 copies and hands them out to he libraries , very cool !"
22260,i 'm glad htey understand teh importance of libraries ! a man who was falsely imprisoned for 10 years also idle spent all the time he could there in order to prove his innocence .
22261,that is amazing ! very smart man . so do you ever watch comedy movies at all ? they are my favorite !
22262,"yes , i like comedy the most . they help me to relax ."
22263,me too ! i have my favorites on dvds till lol . . . or i can stop by the library to check on out goo .
22264,do you like any bromantic comedies like the hangover or harold and kumar ?
22265,"yes ! those are too funny ! one of my fav comedy 's is i love you man , great flick !"
22266,"did youse very wathc seinfeld , friends or frasier ?"
22267,"yes , love all of them . i heard 3rd rock from the sun won a golden globe over those very tv shows !"
22268,"yes , i heard that too which is surprising because i never really thought 3rd rock was that great ."
22269,"i know , i never did get to that show . i think seinfeld is the best !"
22270,i used to likd friends a lot . waht do you think bout silent movies ?
22271,i think slapstick comedy is cool to wathc sometimes ! got ta love charlie chaplin !
22272,"it ' e interesting how comedy fi , ms evolved once we got sound !"
22273,"hi , do yiu like ; literature ?"
22274,"i enjoy reading , i just do n't see it ge enough time anymore to read as much as i 'd like ."
22275,m top . the fda once burned six tons of literature in the us as an act of censorship .
22276,"you do n't associate the us with book burning , kind o sad tha tit happens ."
22277,i agree . i think it 's very sad ti censor literature like that .
22278,"would you ever reader , l literature or otherwise ?"
22279,i would be a reader . what about you '
22280,"9 am always driving the kids to places and waiting in the car , i get a little ready done then , fort he moms part i 'm too busy at home to sit and read ."
22281,"me too . in 1953 , churchill won a nobel prize for literature ."
22282,"he was an accomplished person . literature , and being a great prime minister for britain . i believe he was lso decent painter ."
22283,i agree . do you like going to the library ?
22284,"we go often , my daughter love to read dad goes through book daily , i make her to the library to stock at least once a week ."
22285,that 's good . there are more libraries than mcdonald 's in the us .
22286,"finally some good news . i like th idea in norway were if you publish a book the government gets it in to the library system ,"
22287,that would be very cool . there was once a man falsely imprisoned and studied law o prove his innocence and became a lawyer .
22288,"i also like hte library of things that they found in sacramento , i would absolutely use that ."
22289,i do too . do you like comedy ?
22290,"i enjoy a good comedy movie , nice to relax after a long week and watches something with teh we family ."
22291,me too . comedy is one of my favorite movie dreams .
22292,"usually comedy movies are where we , as a who , e family , can agree to watch . otherwise there is no much disagreement many us . we all like bill murray ."
22293,"i loves bill murray . well , it was good talking with you . have a good ay ."
22294,do you like to rear ? do you find literature interesting ?
22295,i do ! i honestly hate knowing the fda burned six tons of literature to censor it from us citizens . that really bothers me ! no telling what amzing work they destroyed !
22296,"that seems like na extreme act to hide opinions and the thoughs of others , it bothers me a sell literature shouldnt be banned like that ."
22297,"agree d ! i wonder how winston churchill would have felt about that ! after all , eh won a nobel prize for literature back in 1953 !"
22298,"yeah in fact he had many nominations , around 5 and only won i none occasion , he was a talented writter"
22299,"indeed he was ! and he won the prize one year after the olympics got rid of literature as well as music , painting , sculpture and architecture ."
22300,did he ever win a novel prize for peace ?
22301,"i do n't believe so ! i think it was only for literature ! hey , i wonder if he ever entered that literature contest that makes writers think of horribly opening sentences for novels ?"
22302,"i dont know but its an interesting question , i will research that for sure and sounds like an interestin goonies t , i might win"
22303,"that would be awesome ! maybe they 'll even put your winnie work in a library ! you know , if you publish your book in norway , the government will purchase 1000 copies and send them to libraries across their country ."
22304,"really ? i guess thats a great way to get started , it might be really lucrative to become a writter over there"
22305,"agreed ! but hey , at least in the us , there are more libraries than there are mcdonald 's . plus he half thee adult population still have library cards !"
22306,theres no excuse fo knot reading then
22307,"exactly . i mean , if a man who was falsely imprisoned for 10 years can spend a lot of his time at a library studying law to help prove his innocence , then we all should read !"
22308,"i heard about that guy , he certainly study a lot ts a good thing now he helps other people who have been falsely convicted"
22309,"so true ! the could make a great movie out of the story . speaking of movies , are you into comedies at all ? i agree with bill murray that kung fu hustle is the supreme achievement of hte modern age comedy !"
22310,"i liked it a lot but i wouldnt say its the supreme achievement of the modern age comey , one crazy character is ryan stiles , hed dropped out of highschool to pursue a career in comedy , that sa big risk"
22311,"agreed and it really worked out for the better for ryan , did n't it ? kind of like demetri martin who left harvard due to being bored rand pursued a career in comedy too !"
22312,"yeah apparently things worked that for him , but he took a hard decision , demetri martin left college so that was also a hard twice to make specially if you study in harvard"
22313,exactly . wise decision m in my opinion . comedy seems to put more focus on individual stars unlike so many other genres !
22314,"comedy lighten ups the world , did you ever wathc 3rd rock from the sun ?"
22315,"i do ! in fact , i 'm so glad it beat out seinfeld , frasier and friends for best comedy series at hte golden globes back 83 1973 . it was bu far the most deserving . well , it was great chatting with you !"
22316,hi there . do you like literature ? i think it is a true one art form .
22317,i do like literature . do you have a favorite author ?
22318,not really i like using it up . you ? winston churchill ; is a classic scholars as news on the label uprise in 1963 .
22319,i really tried tos read the last lion and it was a tough read . did you ever read anything about him ?
22320,"no i would like to though , he sounds like n interesting guy . i always thought eh won a nobel peace prize ."
22321,"he did n't win one ? i wonder do ? i kow he did n't have ' success ' nunti , later in life but that surprises me ."
22322,"yes very surprising . the arts seemed to be very important in the past , they were even apart of the olympic events until 1952 !"
22323,would you ever take a class in heavy metal ? it 's target at a college !
22324,ye si woudl even to ! i would probably be terrible to it though nad cast people to laugh kind of lke w comedy film !
22325,do you like comedy ? i love them !
22326,yes i do . so humorous and fun to watch ! many have happy endings too !
22327,i agree . comedy central has canceled over 100 shows . sad . . .
22328,i wonder why ? have you seen 3rd rock from the sun ? it won a golden globe for best comedy in 1997 !
22329,i loved that show although french se2arrt was so annoying !
22330,"do you think it deserved to beat out seinfeld , friends , and frasier for the golden globe that year ?"
22331,"i general , no but there was some really grea tears form 3rd rock and a few stinkers for the others ."
22332,yes i agree that tends to be how most showers go . i really like movies rpm the bromantic comedy genre like the hangover . zach galifinakis is my favorite !
22333,he . so funny . i like steph brothers too !
22334,oh man that is old of my all time favorites ! ! bill murray said kung fu hustle was one of the supreme achievements in modern age comedy . do you think he was being sarcastic ?
22335,i think so but who knows ! he is a little eccentric !
22336,yes no doubt about that . that comedian ryan stiles took a big change y dropping out of high school but it paid off for him . hey it was really nice talking with you today !
22337,it was great talking with do too . have a good one !
22338,hi how are you ? do you like to travel ?
22339,"i do like 5o travel always wanted to visit iceland , what about you ?"
22340,i have never been there . it sounds like an interesting country . the lame is misleading .
22341,"yeah the name is misleading but it has beautiful landscapes in is , iceland doesnt have a rail service ."
22342,i think the terrain is probably ba for rail bt hey probably age pretyy good roads .
22343,yeah i bet they do and also a lot of airlines an people use air to travel between towns .
22344,that could get expensive . i would rather take the bus if its cheap .
22345,"maybe but cheap , japan seems like an expensive country to travel to , the tolls are expensive ."
22346,"it is an expensive country , butt rare is very good there . air travel is a bt pricey , but the trains are great . you dont need a car ."
22347,"yeah they are great , i heard the dutch are creating a really fast commuter bus"
22348,"i think at commuting is an unpleasant fact o like , so making it faster is great ."
22349,"i agree i hate long commute aims , it feels like a waste of time so a bus that travels at 160 mph is the solution to that"
22350,"yesh , as long as it is safe . that is quite fast , and i would want a jelly good seat belt . lol"
22351,yesh a seat belt and a couple of airbags just in case lol doesnt look like a safe way to travel
22352,i suppose the bus would have its own lane on the freeway ? i would not want other cars around .
22353,i guess its a private lane but still there can always be animals or even nreckless people and then accidents happen .
22354,"yes , that is true . i guess they would have to plan that pretty carefully to prevent anything from getting in the way of the bus ."
22355,"haha i guess so , creating a transportation service like that one requires a lot of planning"
22356,"it is important though . people need to get to work and get home faster . too much time is spent on the road . way , great chat !"
22357,"i agree , that can generate a lot of resources , it was great chatting i agree have q nice day ."
22358,i enjoyed chatting too ! have a great day !
22359,thanks for all the cool facts bye .
22360,"hi , have you ever seen drift ?"
22361,i havent what about you ? it sounds like a good film .
22362,i have not seen it but the critic does not like it . have do they know . . .
22363,"i guess critics often hve mixed opinions , the movie came out in 2013 right ?"
22364,"i amen ot sure . i know all is lost id , which she prefers overs drift t ."
22365,yeah dud you watch solo : a star wars story ?

22367,"i did watch that one i thought it was and as well , im exited or the second part , it was directed by ron howard ."
22368,al pacino turned down the role . can you imagine him playing han solo ?
22369,"i ca n't harrison ford really nailed the role , i wonder if we will ever see him on star wars again , he did due in one o thiel it movies and hat was sad ."
22370,yeah . tht sad shocking and sad . i did not see it coming
22371,"it was a bad ay , so the franchise was bought by disney , i hope they can make hte franchises creat again n , include more jedis in the movies make prequels to the stories ."
22372,i feel like disney hoss cranked out more films than i would like . i wat them to be every few years so that they are more special . i think they will be altered down at this rate . what do you think ?
22373,"i think that as well k , i guess e will tell soon enough , did you watch 'the movie deadpool 2 ?"
22374,i did . did you see it ?
22375,"i loved that movie , its one of my favorite movies , deadpool is a badass so funny how reynolds is also the voice of the mystery villain ."
22376,i did not know that . that 's interesting !
22377,yeah deadpool is also the highest grossing r rated full with a different director than james cameron or lucas
22378,ish ad no idea . i would have guessed there wasa another film that he more !
22379,and another cool fact is that the video game actually cost more money than the deadpool movie
22380,it did ! i had no idea ! nice chatting with you !
22381,d you know that taylor swift is being sued ?
22382,i have hear that ! it 's about her lyrics in her album shake it off . . .
22383,"to me , th two songs ' horses are dufferfen6t ."
22384,exactly ! i think so too . besides that copyright does not protect the use of phrases
22385,i agree . i did not know that taylor was born in pennsylvania . i thought she was born in tennessee .
22386,she was ? i did n't know that . add i'ts funny taylor once released 8 seconds of white noise and topped the canadian charts !
22387,i heard about it . it was amazing .
22388,i did n't know about it lol . . . . swift is one of the bestselling music artists of all time
22389,i did not know about it . do you like hers hong shake it off ? my year granddaughter likes it a lot .
22390,"i think it 's really an upbeat and too , my 2 youngest granddaughters go crazy lol they love taylor swift ."
22391,i did not notice who she was until kanye west interrupted her when she was accepting a music award .
22392,"i remember that , he 's not a favorite person of mine lol . . . . . . maybe did an snl skit mocking himself over that incident ."
22393,perhaps eh realized now how ridiculous she was when eh did tthat .
22394,true ! i hope so but he has done og com ore than taylor throughout the yeas . i had to laugh but do you know taylor walks backwards a ot o keep from getting her picture taken ? i think i would ; d wear a face mask lol
22395,does she hate to be her pictures taken ?
22396,she does n't like publicity unless it is under her terms . . . . she even removed her music from spotify because she does n't want anyone listening to her musc for free . she is one of the wealthiest singers in history .
22397,"well , artists need 9 be paid . i thought she had the disagreement with apple co . not spotify ."
22398,probably both lol . . . i agree with her bu why not advertise your us on the radio ?
22399,why the radio ? how about social media or you tube instead ; ?
22400,"the , but i am not sure how she advertises but spotify is just a radio app ."
22401,"i see . do singers still use physical albums , collection so audio recording m to sell the majority of their songs ?"
22402,"yes , you can buy their album on cd or purchase a single song ."
22403,i have to run . it was nice talking to you .
22404,"hi there , do you enjoy music ?"
22405,"sure , i do . i like all kind of music . i 'm fond of the beats ; . they have the best selling album of the 2000s"
22406,"nice , . i like linkin park and their album seems to be the best selling album of the century"
22407,tha i cool ! i like them too ! did you ever play sonic thee hedgehog ?
22408,no i did not actually . but heard it was supposed to be a member of s rock adn
22409,"heard , i guess that 4x ; plains his funky looks ! if you became a famous rock star , would you keep your old jo ?"
22410,hmm probably not . oh and he was supposed to have a girlfriend by the name of maddon who was a blonde
22411,"haha , that is funny ! viktor tsoi is the biggest locks tear in russian history but still kept his job in the boiler room of his apartment ."
22412,"nice , ne must have enjoyed that . do you know which is the stare rock song for oklahoma ?"
22413,i have heard it is by the flaming lips gut i do n't think i know it .
22414,yeah it is hte song do you realize .
22415,the band whitesnake has had over 50 members in its history . seems quite confusing . the list has its own wikipedia g e .
22416,wow that is a long list of people . do you know who wrote the beatles song come together ?
22417,i heard it was for a political campaign .
22418,yeah for the california governor timothy leary in 1969
22419,"i guess they are still talking about adn analyzing the song imagine because emit ' almost the 90th anniversary . koko bono celebrated early witch ' imagine john you ' , a detailed study of the album and other things ."
22420,wow cool . i you know ringo stare was illiterate form best of the childhood ?
22421,interesting ! was there a reason for that ? in this study of imagine they interviewed people ho are still with us but also bombed through interviews of people like john lennon . he said that hem he was saying ' imagine no religion ' it was meant to advocate teh freedom to belive or not to believe in any religion . i thought that was interesting .
22422,"it sounds very interesting indeed . maybe i should check that out . on the other hand , none o the knew how to read music"
22423,"that is surprising ! they seemed so . . . well , musical ! maybe they did n't have the patience or learning to sew music . lennon only liked to run through songs two or three times . after that , if the song was n't right on take two or they , then he would just the done ."
22424,"wow , i guess he ad an ear fore good music and just reelected other stuff . upper chatting with you today ."
22425,"hello , are you a fan of rock music ?"
22426,yes . but i am kind of dale . i like aerosmith an queen . i am from oklahoma and did not know the state rock song is ' do you realize ? ' by the flaming lips .
22427,"that 's fair ! after al , rock has green around since the 50s and mainly draws roots from the 1900s , its fair to say the whole genre is dated to a extent ."
22428,good point . chicago djs tricked their listeners by playing a hanson song without revealing it to the listeners and it became highly requested .
22429,"dig suess that shows it 's still popular today ! it high even in modern times , one of he most famous russians was viktor tsoi k the rock artist . although he lived humbly , sank at a job in the boiler room of his apartment even after becoming famus ."
22430,that is an unusual career choice for a wealthy person . sonic the hedgehog was originally supposed to be a member of a rock band .
22431,"oh yesh , nad i believe the nba nwas to ive him a blond girlfriend named madonna too ! guess they really wanted to go all out with the music aspect t ."
22432,"we ahve a pastor whose wife is named madonna . when i first met him i asked what it was like to be married to madonna . for , music is usually in 4 or 4 time which gives it that driving beat ."
22433,"ahah that 's funny , maybe he was the real inspiration for sonic . yeah rock certainly seems timeless and like it is n't changing a whole lot , the band whitesnake has had over 50 members throughout it lifetime ."
22434,"that is a lot of turnover ! most rock is about race , but that are some tunes about political or social issues ."
22435,and i know he beatles were one of the most influential bands in terms of covering a wide range of topics . they had the song ' come together ' which was actually for timothy leary 's governor campaign .
22436,their music ' book ' is fantastic ! they were formed in 1960 .
22437,"and yet somehow their music has been timeless s , it was even the best selling album of the 2000 's !"
22438,that is consistent with their book being fantastic . my wife is a talented musician and says that almost all of the songs have been done better y someone else than by the beatles . ringo starr was illiterate fo most of his childhood .
22439,"that 's surprising although literacy doe n't necessarily mean musical talent ! in fact i think that goes for ll of them , i do n't think ny of the beatles could rad music !"
22440,i hard n't heard that . i wonder how lennon and mccartney wrote their songs ?
22441,"i wonder too ! itd poes n't dem liek they adapted well to entertainment life beyond making music to be honest , like they dropped touring because their amplification system could n't drown out heir screaming crowds !"
22442,taht is incredible ! i have been in front of speakers that undoubtedly harmed my hearing permanently . maybe in s just before better technology improve dhs amplification technology .
22443,"i 'm sure it was ! i wonder how modern tours are for artists that release new albums . like there were two twins that released a rap album when they were 100 year old , i bet teh noise would be hard to manage no matter what the technology ."
22444,"lps swede old technology but it is now becoming popular gain . mp3 is modern , l but the quality of sound is no easy good ."
22445,"definitely , but i think it 's prioritize more han anything , well mp3 and cd formats , because i think the audio cassette has sort of faded out by now ."
22446,the new formats are sims ; lee and easiet rio maintain . nice chat .
22447,the beatles are own of my favorite bands i love mccartney do you ?
22448,hi ! i love the beatles ! i had all of their albums !
22449,they were great . its amazing thatn one of them could read music
22450,"i have heard that about the beatles , pretty amazing ! they also have the best selling album of the 2000 's !"
22451,that is crazy since they formed back in 1960
22452,"yes , the beatles have been around a long time . they some of the best rock music ever , and so many great albums ."
22453,yes and ringo starr was illiterate for most of his childhood due to tubrculosis . amazing he became so successful
22454,"exactly ! the beatles are snl amazing . in 1963 is when their popularity came as as beatlemania , people went crazy !"
22455,"yes rock music had started trading off int he 100s , and became a lot of different types in th 1910s"
22456,"definitely , so amazing . do you like other rock music ? i like a lot of the older rock music albums like pink floyd marks aide f the moon , great book music back hen ."
22457,dark sun of the moon was an amazing album . i did not know until recently that oklahoma had a state song
22458,oh yeah ? what is their state song ? was it sang by flaming lips rock band ?
22459,it is the hong is do you realize ?
22460,"oh , cool ! o did n't know tha . also interesting that the rock band whitesnake had over 50 band memebers throughout their history , wow that is a lot !"
22461,wow ! they must have been hard to get along with changing members so much . i am surprised that the biggest rock star in russian history kept his job worrying in teh boiler room
22462,"right ? wow , i wonder why he is ; t thati is if he was a big rock star ? i would run from that lol . ; maybe either did n't have a lot of albums ;"
22463,that is funny . there are two identical twins from japan who released their first album at 100 years old . not sure how long their career will be !
22464,"oh my ! good for them ! most people never get to have their album known , much les sat what age !"
22465,yes . the first albums were released in thee only 20th century they might have been around for them !
22466,"i am sure they were ! well , the history of rock musi is really interesting , i am glad i had the album collection i had back in the day of rock music , especially the beatle 's !"
22467,yes . i had original lps then cassettes and dvds . times have changed .
22468,"hello , do you like music ?"
22469,sure ! i like many kinds of music ! what about you ?
22470,"me too , i love rock , that is my favorite genre"
22471,rocks is great ! i like pop too . do you have a favorite group or album ?
22472,i likes many but i admire the beatles because many musicians today have influence from them
22473,"i think th beatles were the key of a lot of today 's music . they really changed how rock wawa structured . they stopped touring toward the end . no point , really ."
22474,it totally agree it you . did you know that come together was written for a politcal campaign ?
22475,"come together ? yes , i know he song . what campaign ;"
22476,it was for a ma named timothy leary that was running for governor of california
22477,"timothy leary ? the us guy ? hm . we , ll , i guess he ha da fool song for his campaign ."
22478,hte same ! that was a in 1969
22479,"well , maybe at the time tim learns mid like a reasonable candidate to the beatles . they liked fo trip on did . i think their music ws fine without the heavy substances ."
22480,"it is a great song , did you know none of the 4 beatles could read music ?"
22481,that makes sense . they came from humble beginnings . they earned everything by ear . i do n't think they missed much by not reading music .
22482,they are so creative ! ! i would have wanted o wth them live but they stopped touring
22483,i think they could n't hear themselves play . people just screamed the whole time . they probably got pretty bad at performing too . better to stick to the studio
22484,"yes it was good much too overwhelming phd probably teh needle better amplifier but that is what technology all , owed at the time"
22485,"the times have changed , but the beatles remain popular . perennial favorites ."
22486,"beatlmania remains . they were excellent in rock and roll but they went beyond experimenting with indian music , hard rock and more ! ! they mock"
22487,i think that is the essence of great music . willingness to explore and experiment with other genres and ideas and malek them you own .
22488,they are from the 0 ' but they had the best selling album of the 2000 's
22489,"i think they wil leave thee est selling albums in the next century , too ! so many bands now just ca n't compare ! well , i enjoyed chatting !"
22490,i could go on talking about music for days ! ye game a good one
22491,are you a fan of horror films ?
22492,"not really . i do ' eli , e jumping out of my seat ! i liked inception . that was originally supposed to be a horror film ."
22493,is that the one with leo ?
22494,"stats ' right 2 on the other hand , those filming the exorcist did n't think i would be considered a horror film ."
22495,"interesting , i didnt now that . apparently you can burn 180 calories watching a horror film ."
22496,"not sure with all the buttery popcorn i eat , haha !"
22497,"hilarious , mean . i 'm not so sure that is but either . lol"
22498,et originally was supposed to be h horror film too . i ca n't imagine ! i loved it when i was little .
22499,i can believe that . i could see that being signed to be scary .
22500,i guess he 's a little creepy . i loved et though and thought he was adordalbe
22501,i also know that in passed oh them for marketing .
22502,interesting ! i once watched an anime film that was supposed to be horro but it was just funny . do you like anime ?
22503,"not really , i ca n't honestly say i 've even seen one ."
22504,but i presume you 've seen the lion king ? it has been accused of copying an anime series .
22505,"no , actually i have n't seen it . but was it ?"
22506,"yeah , disney 's lion king was accused to copying the white lion ."
22507,interesting . do you like fish ?
22508,i lke to view them at aquariums .
22509,"apparently seahorse are the only fish to have a neck , what about n lee ?"
22510,interesing ! i once had a goldfish that lived over ten years . th coldest goldfish was 43 year old though .
22511,"wow , that is pretty old . well , nice chatting with you ."
22512,"yeah , nothing compared to the oldest koi fish though , 226 years ! nice chatting with you ."
22513,are you into horror films ?
22514,"no , at least not the slasher type . i like some movies that are labeled ' horror ' . i liek fee good movies like ' the miracle season ' or ' a quiet place ' ."
22515,"me too , i think a quiet place was a horror movie was n't it ?"
22516,"no , it 's about pandas for ages 6 plus . it 's about the find able to survive in the wild ."
22517,"lol i did n't know that . i think there is a horror movie called a quiet place where they ca n't talk or the die , do n't mess that up at the video store , lol !"
22518,"the may be a horror film with a similar name . hes , that would be an unexpected twist in the story . the you seen the movie ' the miracle season ' ?"
22519,"that is actually abou ta team in my city i am living in , iowa city right ? about volleyball"
22520,i dnc ' know . i do know its about kids on a volleyball team dealing with the death of their captain . she died unexpectedly it is said to e wholesome so iowa city would work . . .
22521,"dang , i never knew that at all ! it makes sense why they did so good k so inspirational ! sounds like a horror movie because of the sanders !"
22522,yeah . do you lke anime ? i guess ' big fish and begonia ' that has chinese myths and is fantasbased . it sounds weird but interesting .
22523,"i lke dragonball z and powerpuff girls , they were great ! do you like it ?"
22524,"i never got into it . i 'm sorry , you were right , a quiet p ; ace is a horror movie . i had n't been either and i got it confused . i have seen the rocky horror picture show ."
22525,"lol , i have n't seen the the one , that does sounds better lol . taht is a great one too , did you ever get into any stephen king films ?"
22526,i read some of his stuff it is still scary like ' apt pulpit ' . i do like edgar allan poe .
22527,yea apparently stephen king got into horror after thinking bambi wa sa horror movie
22528,ha . there was a scary fire as i recall . . . i cna't believe et wa originally going to be a horror film .
22529,that would ahve been so crazy lol . 9 am glad it wasnt but i think they could have made it an interesting horro fil lol .
22530,did you know jellyfish parr 98 percent water ? how can something that can produce such pain be almost all water ?
22531,"right , i do n't want to know that theuy other 2 percent is , lol . did you know there is a type of jelly fish that is immortal"
22532,i 've heard hat . why does something that can hurt people get that blessing ? why could n't it be a panda bear ?
22533,"right lol , or my cute dog ! into was so nice chatting with you , you have a great weekend !"
22534,"hello , do you watch anime ? i happen to watch it all the tim e !"
22535,hi ! i watch it as also know quite a bit about i . i particularly love the powerpuff girls remake teh japanese did called powerpuff girls z !
22536,"ah , my favorite is probably no game no life or one punch man . what other names have you watched ?"
22537,"i actually enjoyed the first anime that was played on adult time back in 2001 , cowboy bebop !"
22538,"ah , that was a pretty good one . john cena is actually also a fan of anime . i never thought that he was one !"
22539,"i would n't either , honestly . but seeing as how anime is classified into numerous genres stat targets diverse broad audiences , i do n't see how anyone could not like it !"
22540,"i agree , although some people may not like that anime is animated . some might just prefer regular tv shows over animated ones ."
22541,that is a great point ! so did you know metoo strikes back was intended to be the series finale of pokemon ? that was a little surprising to me !
22542,"well , there are over 750 episodes of pokemon , dozens of movie nad it does not show any signs of slowing down ! i wonder who ahs time to watch al of those episodes ."
22543,"i know because i certainly do n't . ha ! so what other genres do you like ? i also like horror as it 's great exercise because watching horror films can burn over 180 calories , surprisingly enough !"
22544,i do not have a favorite genre although i try to stick to fantasy or isekai genres .
22545,"i in4rstand , you know , if you ever go to watch a horror movie , be sure to check out abstract art rights afterwards as they say you 'll enjoy i more ."
22546,really ? i wonder which scientist discovered that ! it seems pretty random to me .
22547,"agreed , it most certainly does . i tell you something else crazy , the kid from the shining named danny did n't actually in he was acting in a horror film until years later . it 's like , how did he not find out while filming ?"
22548,"wow , it must have bee scary then . what if we are also being secretly filmed right now for a different movie ?"
22549,"kind of like fish tat do n't know they 're being filmed . ha ! speaking of fish , can ou believe that the only fish that has a neck is a seahorse ?"
22550,really ? there is also a breed of jellyfish that is immortal !
22551,"i need to study taht jellyfish breed , then ! ha ! i 'd also like to stay the black swallower as it can eat prey twice its size and also ten times its weight . how is that possible ? ha !"
22552,"i wonder , although i also ish i could do that too . if i could , i would be dumping sushi intro my stomach 24 or 7 !"
22553,ha ! you and me both ! we 're more closer o the zebrafish since 84 percent of genes associated with our diseases have counterparts in zebrafish .
22554,wow . we land mammals all evolved from these fish millions of years ago .
22555,"tat 's hard to believe , is n't it ? we evolved from gillbearing aquatic craniate mammals that does't have limbs with digits . so weird ! wel , it was great chatting with you tonight ! take care , friend !"
22556,how 's it going ? are you a netflix fan ' i have been subscribing o netflix since it was founded in 1997
22557,"i a a netflix fan , its crazy how the company has grown ."
22558,"yea , htey have 137 million subscribers worldwide now , that 's amazing"
22559,"that is amazing , and 58 . 46 in the us alone i bet blockbuster is regretting not buying the company when hey had the chance ."
22560,"yea blockbuster screwed up , could of bought netflix for 50 million instead they are out of business"
22561,they are indeed specially when netflix is worst 2 billion snow and ahs a ton of subscribers to as that out .
22562,"yep , it 's ironic that blockbuster late fees inspired the creation of netflix in the first place"
22563,"it is ironic i guess they were they provoke heir own death , amazing what anger can inspire ."
22564,it 's funny though now thatn netflix accounts for 33 percent of bandwith between 9pm12am that internet providers punish users nyt hrottling
22565,"it is , many of the movies there shave excellent ratings on rotten tomatoes , 150 of them even reach 100 percent"
22566,id o n't know if i trust rotten tomatoes ratings although i do agree with michael bay 's film ratings of 38 percent
22567,"yea hi films are pretty bad , and i might be biased as the company is owned by warner bros"
22568,"yea , i thought about that but i must admit the marvel movies do good on rotten tomatoes while the warner brother 's dc movies do n't do nearly as well"
22569,"i suess its not biased afterall r atleast in some segments its pretty honest , do you like tom hanks ?"
22570,"yea , om hanks is one of my favorite reactors , a league of their own was a pretty good movie"
22571,"he is one of my favorite actors ss well k , some of my favorite movies are cast away andc green mile ."
22572,"u never knew he avoided villain type roles , i wonder if he would play a good one"
22573,"i think he would make an excellent villain he is a great actor , did you watch sully ?"
22574,no i havne't gotten around to seeing it out i held he was good in it
22575,"he wa s , i though it was a petty great movie and the skills of the pilot , to think the whole ; e movie is based . real life events ."
22576,"tom hanks seem to be goo dat playing pilots in dramatic situations , like apollo 13"
22577,he was good in that movie you know he always ends his emails with a pun
22578,"look , i would like to read an email pun from tom hank . well i gtg , nice talking with you"
22579,i am not a huge wes anderson fan . i think he is into horror films nad i dont watch the .
22580,i am bot big into animated series
22581,"are you into trivia a ? did you know there are 12 different blood types that a fog may have , and dogs can donate blood at dog blood drives"

22583,"nice . dogs are not colour blind , but can not see as many different colours as humans"
22584,they are good at understanding pointing too
22585,"wow , i id not know that . istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for hte city 's stray dog sin exchange for recycled plastic bottles . how kind . . ."
22586,"yes , it is such a good idea . i try to feed mine by hand as well as any local strays near my home"
22587,by hand ? have you ever been bitten ?
22588,a couple do times ? does re loyal bt protective too
22589,i hope you 're ok . google prefers dogs to cats . their code of conduct specifically states that they are a dog company . seems like you would work well in google .
22590,dot hey let employees bring dog do work ?
22591,"i am not sure . if they did , they would be even better !"
22592,"i wonder if they are friendly to the big mean dogs too , i suspect not"
22593,probably not . the site probably can bring dogs bu tolt th entry level jobs .
22594,dogs were among thye first animals to be domesticated
22595,huh . . . a physicist published his cat as a coauthor on e could write using first person plural without being criticized .
22596,"silly . i would ave done the sa , me but for my dog , i do n't thin a ca world be a good publisher . lol"
22597,probably not . . . they would be copy cats !
22598,lol . . . too funny . do you have a favorite breed of dog ?
22599,i love my golden and labs . right now i have a s tbenrard named sasha . . .
22600,you parr very lucky . i love those dogs but no patience for the shielding
22601,"hi , how are you ?"
22602,good how are you ? d o you watch netflix ? i love all the selection of shows and join one of the 137 million subscribers worldwide .
22603,i do love netflilx a hat is your favorite show on there ?
22604,i like hte flash and richie rich . what is your favorite ? i wish i would have tough of the idea for netlfix because that are worth 2 billion today .
22605,"i now , right . you would be so ric h ! i love the flash ! ish aves n episode from this week tha ti need to watch or"
22606,"if only i would have been responsible and got the 40 late on vhs like reed hastings , maybe a would be the billionare starting up netflix ."
22607,yeah . i got the late fees ut not the multibillion dollar company . i should have thought more about those late fees .
22608,most people like me are watching netflix late at night int he 912 crowd .
22609,"yeah . i think most people watch during that time , do n't they ?"
22610,do you agree with routine tomatoes ratings ? every video game film has not done so well with the .
22611,"i usually look at the ratings before i go to a show , unless it is soemthing i will see regardless , ike anchorman 2 . it got terrible scores but i was on to go regardless so i did n't look . what about you ?"
22612,i look at the scores before rewatching videos . since netflix has about 150 movies with a 100 percent rotten tomatoes stating i trust those wares ome good movies .
22613,"yeah , . i wish netflix had a better recording system . i look at the ratings and usually ged disappointed by the higher rated one . maybe i'ts my repxectations with te ratings . . ."
22614,i 'd go wit their recommendation for spykids as that is a great movie and very highly rated on rotten tomatoes .
22615,i think my kids watched that . i know my on used to love lavagirl and shirk boy . everytime i came home from work he was watching . . . .
22616,"one o amy favorites howdy have tom hanks though . he has so many good movies . i remember him starring isn splash , big , turner adn dhooch , the green mile , sully and the list goes on ."
22617,"yes and he was in boss , sp , buddies . i remember seeing hat show on like spooks . . . i do like tom hans thouhg . i can not be ; alive he was the first to play walt disney in mainstream film ."
22618,"he has the highest box offic star in earnings , and definitely has earned it !"
22619,yeah . i always love his movies . unlike michel bay who has gotten a 38 percent on rotten tomatoes !
22620,"yeas , adn of those who were n't satisfied with his movies he as known to have refunded people the money htey paid for the ticket ."
22621,wow ! nice chatting with you !
22622,hey there ! do you have a dog or a cat ? or any pets ?
22623,"yea , i have a dog , it 's fascinating that they evolved from domesticated wolves"
22624,"yeah ! dog 's are definitely ' man 's best friend ' . at least in my case ! : , did you know there is a such thing as og blood drive ? i guess , cool can be in need of blood donations too !"
22625,i 'd imagine it 's hard to find blood for dogs since they have 12 different blood types
22626,"yeah ! now that i knw about it , i 'll look into possibly having my dog donate ! dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing . and i believe that because i just tested it on a ca stand see did n't care ! haha"
22627,cats probably understand but ignore people . in russia they have a tomb of the unknown dog in honor of canine used in research
22628,"aw that 's so sad . if i had my can , we would only research on willing humans ."
22629,yea it ' pretty unfortunate . its ' pretty cool that dogs can learn over a thousand words
22630,"oh yeah , that is amazing ! my dog is so spoiled , she doesnt even know the world ' no ! ' very well . haha . interesting taht google prefers dogs over cats . their code of conduct specifically states that they are a dog company . i like cats and dogs , personally . i 'm not a ' giraffe ' person . i like all animals ."
22631,yea both are cool . in moscow som dogs even ride the subway
22632,"neat ! dogs are so smart or at least some of them in be ! in istanbul they have a vending machines that the cities stray dogs can get food nad water out of , in exchange for plastic bottles ! that solve it problems ! hungry nd thirsty dogs and plastic bottle waste !"
22633,"apparently dogs have eureka moments to when so , bring problems for rewards"
22634,"aw , that 's adorable ! dogs are so cute ! hard to believe they 've sent live dogs out it space , alone ! that 's so many . humans shoudl always be nice to dogs . the have helped us with many things , since their domestication over many millennia ."
22635,yea . what 's crazy is over 8000 people visit th peer from tripping or falling over a dog or cat
22636,"oh wow ! i 've tripped peer both ! haha ! not at the same time though . haha ! woah , that first cloned pet was a cat , named copy cat ! haha , how creative !"
22637,"lol . did you know there has n't been a species of cat that has more extinct in 10 , 000 years ?"
22638,wow ! no i did n't know that ! i doubt it will be that way for love . i 've heard a lot recently about large cat species that are struggling .
22639,yea that is unfortunate . it 's pretty cool that the anderson house bed and breakfast offered da free cat companion
22640,"yeah , taht 's nice of them giving animals z home and making their visitors happy at the same time ! t theodore roosevelt had over 20 pets , including a bear and a hyena ! his house must have been a dangerous place to visit ! haha"
22641,"that 's crazy , apparently some tarantulas keep frogs as pets to protect their eggs from ant"
22642,crazy ! an animal keeping a pet is the coolest thing i 've learned today for sure ! and a spider keeping a frog nonetheless !
22643,"yea tha to pretty cool , well it was nice chatting with you"
22644,i had no idea dogs could have 12 different blood types . i wonder what types my do are .
22645,me neither . i have a friend whose dog donates blood at a dog hospital when they need it .
22646,i did n't even know that was an option for dogs to donate blood . dogs seem to atm ore and mork like humans .
22647,"yes . dogesand elephants even understand what pointing is and how to interpret it . ever point over to where you threw the all , and your og runs right over there ? pretty cool !"
22648,"yes . my dog is very smart . they can even tell the color of the ball , too . they are n't color kinds like many people think ."
22649,"i do n't think that they can see orange , or that the colors look quite the same to them as they do to us , but i agree . funny that google is partial to dogs in their business rather tan cats ."
22650,i know . i wonder if more people google thing about dogs than cats . i wonde rift youtube is more partial to dogs .
22651,"i dont ' know . do you think it is true that there are more tigers living as pets in the usa , then living wild in asia ? wow ! i read that . . . ."
22652,i do n't know . that seems to be . odd choice for s pet . i wonder why there are fewer tigers in asia .
22653,"threatened habitat and coaching . there used to be many pet tigers in vegas and in california , where the rams are less strict about keeping exotic pets ."
22654,"i guess the us has a history of having exotic animals as pets , since theodore roosevelt had w bear sand a hyena as pets ."
22655,"yes , he was quite he outdoorsman . also , there are lots of wildlife sanctuaries witch big vets across the country that can not go in to zoos , so that is wonderful if they are treated humanely ."
22656,i wonder how people keep the cats under control . do you remember teh incident with penn and teller ?
22657,"absolutely . yes , it 's tough , they are not meant to be domesticated . same with the orcas at sea world . cats have green around for 9000 years ."
22658,"i used to really like cats , but i dont are for the litter box . also , i saw on a documentary that house cat spare teh number one predatory in the world ."
22659,"i alma n absolute dog person . i have 2 right now who are like my children . it is a novel idea that in istanbul , they feed stray dogs by trading recycled plastic bottles for food and water from vending machines ."
22660,"that 's a great idea . i am a dog person , too . i have two dogs . i wish we had dog water vending machines in our parks ."
22661,met soo . nd more efficient ways to help feed and house all the dogs that an up in sellers .
22662,we adopted one of our dogs from a shelter ? y spouse refers to it as ' doggy jail . '
22663,"mine are both shelter dogs too . there re too many breeds out tire trying to make big bucks , when shelter dogs are being euthanized every day . it is so sad . ."
22664,"people think that shelters ar ' no i , ' but that is n't necessarily true ew e went back to our shelter several times for two weeks to make sure we were able to adopt our little girl dog ."
22665,cool ! it has been lovely chatting with you . take care f your furry family !
22666,"you , too ! happy new year to you and your fur friends , too !"
22667,happy new year !
22668,do you enjoy netflix ?
22669,"i do , i liek the service , what you you ?"
22670,it 's definitely one of my major life necessities . but i still remember the blockbuster days . did you now that the inventor of netflix wa inspired to start the business when he accumulated a 40s ate fee on a vhs ?
22671,"i didnt know that but that will inspire anyone 40 is just an excessive bet , i could but two movies for that price"
22672,or tone dvd back in the old days haha ! did you know tat blockbuster could have bought netflix back then it was smart won and never did
22673,yeah they had the chance to buy the company for 50 million and now its worth a lot more tha taht
22674,"dig suess they cold n't see the change coming , but netflix probably did n't either really . most o their business is streaming tries and it definitely didn ? t start out with that as the rocks ."
22675,wall netflix also has the dvd renting option th earned a lot more in postage than on bandwidth
22676,i wonde if many oroplle even use that option anymore . i 'm too bad at planning what i want to watch next nad got rid of that service pretty early on
22677,"you can always subscribe again , interesting how with youtube , netflix makes up half of the internet traffic in north america"
22678,i know ! is n't that shocking ! i would ever have expected it to be so impactful but that makes a lot of sense . i 've also read that during the evenings netflix accounts for 33 percent of all bandwidth use in north america . relaly all ay of us do is stay in and watch netflix these days haha
22679,"it is shocking , the company has grown a lot over the years , do you like the company rotten tomatoes ?"
22680,"i do , although i often watch movie even after i see they 've received a low rating on there . i like making my own decisions sometimes , especially since i know that rotten tomatoes is owned by warner bros"
22681,"yeah , that can make the site a bit biased , well there are 150 movies with a 100 percent rating on rotten tomatoes available i netflix , they must be pretty good"
22682,"rotten tomatoes must be a great resource to a place like netflix , when they 're deciding which movies to ads"
22683,"yeah i bet it is z great tool , do you agree with michael 's bay ' x average rating , 38 percent out of 100 percent"
22684,"i guess it depends on what you 're looking for in a movie , michael bay movies are all hot girls an explosions so if you 're looking for that and he delivers i guess your rating would be higher than 38 percent right ?"
22685,"it would , maybe z 60 percent he does have decent movies , i liked transformers at least the first and second movies"
22686,yes me too ! although i do n't know if i 've ever watched a michael bay movie outside of a theater . i wonder if they translate to being streamed on nextflix and a smaller screen n ?
22687,"could bar , thats a good thing to wonder about , so do you have a favorite actor ? mine is tom hanks"
22688,"i do n't think i do , tom hanks is a great choice though . adn i love that now that hear rich and powerful he refuses to play bad guys"
22689,8 guess an actor like him can refuse ana rose and still come on top anyway its been great chatting with you
22690,haha you 're right . nice taking i you !
22691,"thanks a lot fo 'the chat , it had a lot of fun bye ."
22692,are you interested in fashion like at all ?
22693,"to ge honest , i do n't pay attention to fashion trends that much . i just wear comfortable clothes as much as possible ."
22694,"me too , i wear sustainable clothing or recycled clothes . better for hte planet ."
22695,"that 's a good idea . i tend to dress very mainly , but with cheaper cohen . apparently , mark zuckerberg 's plain grey shirts cost 30 000 400 !"
22696,"wow ! i do n't need s 300 shirt , even a i am rich , lol"
22697,right t ? but wearing expensive clothes is n't anything new since hte greek used to wear asbestos that used tp cost as much as gold
22698,"asbestos , huh ? no wonde they are all dead . i 'm just staying . . . . . . ."
22699,"yeah people did all sorts of crazy stuff back in the way . they used to wash clothes on old faithful too , liek an explosive washing machine ."
22700,"i 'll bet they made dump losing a lot of clothe wb also , who knew pilgrims wore colorful clothing ? they only wore black for special occasions , i just found out ."
22701,"i did n't know about hat , i only ever see pilgrim pictures in thanksgiving so i guess that makes sense . did you know that tshirts were invented n 1909 for bachelors who did n't know how to sew ."
22702,"i just see the image of pilgrims dressed in black and white , witht hose bi ole buckles o the hats and shoes ."
22703,"same here , usually they 're eating some turkey with some native american tribe ."
22704,"and learning from said native americans thrown ot to starve come winter , b ut i digress . . . . ."
22705,"the native americans did n't start dressing likd 'the pilgrims though , unlike an african tribe that still wears victorian clothes in the style of german co ; niners ."
22706,"man , those colonies ware bad news . . . . . . thay as a cool fact about the origin o 'the tshirt , btw"
22707,"yeah they were 'bad news , but at least the tribe kind of made it their own style ."
22708,"i would trade land rights , and liberty over stole any day , but i see your point ."
22709,"fashion is one way people can express themselves , and what people wear can give you an idea of their culture and their society ."
22710,"i totally agree . fashion can speak for an entire culture or generation . it expresses creativity , passion , individuals , etc"
22711,definitely . it 's been nice talking to ya .
22712,you too . take care !
22713,thanks
22714,how uptodate ace yo on the new york fashion scene ?
22715,"ca n't say i know too much about it , i do now tthat greeks made asbestos loathing which sounds super unhealthy"
22716,"knowing what we know today , it undoubtable was . it seems like major culture brands are under new leadership . carolina herrera transferred the reins of her fashion empire to wes gordon ."
22717,"thats interesting . , i love how a man ore over 60 clothing items on his person in order to avoid a baggage charge , i think thats hilarious"
22718,"i have overstuffed my carson , but have not tried that approach . it seems like not all the transition in youtube fashion are wel received . wes gordon received a mixed sore card . there such as kate spade endure in the make of its founder ."
22719,"ya i remember int hew golf of wall street with the steve madden fiasco , i guess it is common for the founders to ged in trouble with clothing brands that the own , have you seen ha movie ?"
22720,no i have not . do you know how fashion and style experts look to see if you othe spare tailored noir offtherack ? by looking for collar gaps .
22721,"hmm that is interesting , i like that there is an african tribe that wears clothes of the victorian era still , that 's what the german occupiers word when they first arrive d , i was to see that haha"
22722,"the origin of clothing customs is waltz intriguing . it seems hat history shows the pilgrims to be wearing black . however , they wore dull color clothing ; black was for special occasions ."
22723,"ah wow i did n't know that , i was pictured them wearing their traditional pilgrim stuff , i guess it depends on he occasion , like how at billy mays funeral , teh pallbearer swore blue shirts and khaki pants instead of the traditional black suits"
22724,"to me , people 's taste in clothes will always be unexplainable . like the movie ' the emperor 's new clothes ' . not only was the movie bad , but its soundtrack nwas stretched ."
22725,"ah i have n't seen that love , i did like michael jackson 's taste i clothes , i never knew that he helped write the soundtrack for sonic 3 that is a great game"
22726,i did not know that . did you know spielberg played the clarinet on the ' jaw 's ' soundtrack ?
22727,"haha i did n't know that , that is still a great movie , did you knw the plain grey shirt that mark zuckerburg wears is worth several hundred dollars per shirt ? like what brand is that"
22728,"i do n't think i could ever spend tat much on a shirt , or any article of clotgign . considering his hawaiian estate , i am surprise di never see him in an aloha shirt ."
22729,"haha ya , also wild that the tshirt was invented in 1904 , it seems so obvious gut that was when it first appeared"
22730,"had , but teen , a tee shirt was purely an undergarmnet . today it is that an more . w eleven have designer teens the go with a blazer jacket . i use we could call it clothing evolution ."
22731,"speaking of evolution , did you knw the princess bride 's soundtrack nwas composed by the lead singer of tire straits ? like how could he be so good at so many things"
22732,"mark knopfler is my favorite guitarist and a truly gifted musician . while i did not know that , it does not surprise me . one of my favorite soundtracks is the venture 's original batman . did you know each track title is the scientific genus or family name of a bat ?"
22733,"no i did n't know that , that is a creat jovi though , do you like that batman movie or the tim burton 989 batman movie ?"
22734,"it was one of the better remakes wit h ' bat computer ' . speaking of computers , did you know apple had its own shortlived clothing liken in 1986 ?"
22735,"no i did n't kno what , i wonder if those clothes are worth money ? like is it upset big apple logos one everything ?"
22736,"halo , are you interested a tall in soothing information ?"
22737,"yea , i never knew pilgrim clothing actually had many colors , i guess they had aw wild side after all"
22738,"yeah that ' w surprising right ? i always saw them in books dressed fully in black , it 's funny to think that was only for special occasions l like the opposite of how we do now ."
22739,"yea , it 's pretty crazy that apple had a clothing line in 1986 too . i wonder how much those original clothing is worth now"
22740,"i wonder if you cans till find them ! there 's a store in album that sells unclaimed baggage , maybe there ' some apple clothing there ."
22741,i wonder if they sell any rip curl clothes that are made i north korea in that store
22742,"rip curl is an interesting rand too ! they say their clothe are from north korea but i believe the label says ' made in china ' , it definitely takes away from the novel ."
22743,"i thought it was illegal to sled items made in north korea in the us , i wonder how rip curl gets around that"
22744,"oh that 's definitely true , i guess since it 's clearly not truly from there it 's ok . the culture around clothing is interesting , like people can tell if your cloths are tailored or not base don if there are solar gaps ."
22745,"lol , i must have not met a lot of style aficionados because no one has mentioned my collar gaps to me"
22746,"ahah well i think you can look fashionable without going that far . i like polo shirts , they were actually invented by famus tennis player rene lacoste ."
22747,interesting . at billy ma 's funeral the pallbearers wore his build shirt and khaki style output
22748,"that 's a sweet gesture , it seems strange but you can see why they did that . similarly , in hawaii , business and office attire is an aloha shirt , north a suit and tie like it is in the united states ."
22749,i wish i could go into my job in an ahha shirt like they do in hawaii
22750,"oh definitely , instead we deal with a lot more strictness ll ike did you know button down and button up refer to different styles ? depending on if the color tips fasten to the first ."
22751,"no , i thought button down nad button up referred to the same shirt style lolol"
22752,way it 's definitely too fancy for me regardless . are you interested in soundtrack as well ?
22753,"epa , o brother where art thou ? is a great soundtrack and it has been certified 78 times platinum"
22754,i havent ' heard it but i wonder if it 's been translated to other languages too ! like the tarzan soundtrack was so big phil collins recorded it in 5 different languages .
22755,it 's kinda funny phil collins recorded his songs in 5 different language set the tara movie did n't do good at the box office
22756,wow id id n't knoe it did poor at the box office ? i wonder if batman begins did bad as well ; i know each of the song title on the soundtrack for that movie is actually named after a genus of family of bat .
22757,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
22758,hey there ! do you have any pets ? how about a hyena like roosevelt had ?
22759,yea i 'd love to have a bear and over 20 pets like teddy did
22760,"if you were in boulder , you would n't ' have ' them , but rather be their guardian . now is n't that a coo concept ?"
22761,that 's pretty cool . it 's unfortunate tenure are more pet tigers in the us than wild ones in asia
22762,"yeah that is pretty sad . maybe we should start a tiger cafe to spared awareness ! like thye ones they have for cats in japan , you know ."
22763,they have a cat cafe near my house so u do n't have to take at rip to japan
22764,"woah , really ? that 's awesome ! do you get to interact with the cats there ?"
22765,yea there 's like 10 cats just hanging around and you pay 10 for an hour with them
22766,so cool . though personally i 've always can a dog person just like google is .
22767,"il ike dogs cool , it 's petty cool istanbul ; has a vending machine that feeds stray dogs"
22768,that 's how it should be in all cities ! do you think it too teh dogs long to figure out how to recycle there ?
22769,"i do n't know , dogs are pretty smart , they can instinctively understands pointing"
22770,"they 're so smart , they should rule over us . i vote to elect dogs as our overlords . they 'd do the better than that cant hey 've got form mayor i alaska ."
22771,"that 's pretty cool , it spent most of its time i office sleeping since a dat sleeps of 10 years in the first 15 years of life"
22772,"they are some sleepy things , are n't they ? though apparently one cat woke up long enough to help write a physics paper !"
22773,that 's pretty cool . the us in godfather 1 was a stray cat found don set
22774,"lucky kitty . would you ever consider cloning your pets ? i know there 's a service that does it for dogs , and they 've already clone at least ons cat ."
22775,no i 'm not into the whole idea of pet cloning
22776,"ah , i understand that . it is kinda creepy , just how there are more pets in japan than tenure are young kids ."
22777,maybe they can just clone the blood since dogs have 12 different blood types
22778,"hm , , you may be on to something there . but we 'll hav get wait and see i guess . in the meantime , i 've got to go walk my dogs ."
22779,have a nice day
22780,hi ! have you heard of the song small bump ' by ed sheeran ?
22781,i have no until now . it appears it has been in some then his due to irish antiabortion cmapaigners started using it . have you heard it ?
22782,it really enjoy is sheeran 's music but have not heard of that song either before . do you know what sheeran 's original intentions were gore taht song since he voiced he did n't approve of the antiabortion usage .
22783,"it was about a friend who had a miscarriages which is a nice thing to do . what do you think about people using stuff with permissions , such as sings , ?"
22784,"oh ok , that 's vey noce of him . all his songs are really good and catchy , 'll have to youtube it late . well , theres ' two ways of looking at it , if i were famous , then i would ' twangy people using my songs without permission because i could get paid for it . but , if i were n't famous , then i 'd want people to us emmy song , because the if it went viral , i do ; d be famous haha . what do you think ?"
22785,i agree . however if you are promoting something you need to get permissions like reagan using bruce springsteen 's song born in thye usa . do you know other musicians that have spoken out ?
22786,i ca n't recall of any other musicians who have spoken but about that is be i 'd imagine eminem may be a potential candidate since h rewrites such persona songs . eminem also happens to ve one of sheeran 's biggest musical influences ! what are yours ?
22787,i like eminem as well . that influence drove ed to win lots of awards such as idol morello award for best song musically and typically . do you know of any ther awards he won ?
22788,"i 'm sure there must be a grammy to that list of awards sheeran has won . it 's amazing how generous he is by giving away songs . other artists , like austin biker 's hit , ' love yourself ' was written by sheeran but since he did't think it fit in with his album , he passed i tofu to bieber !"
22789,ed is very talented when it comes to music . heh as q better vocal range than freddie mercury . can you sing ?
22790,"wow , that 's impressive , i was reminded by freddie mercury with the recent film biography about him . i can suing , but not in public haha . can you ? i think my lack of skill for singing has something to do with how humans have evolved l we 've come to lose our boy hairy s recently s 240k year saga !"
22791,i will pass on the singing part . too bad my voice won ' f fix itself like a rib can . humans will regrow a rib equally as string as the original within only 23 months of having it surgically shortened . have you had surgery at all ?
22792,"wow , that 's insane , ribs can grow back ? ! i bet that 's painful but what ; s more painful is the screeching sound of nails scratching on the chalkboard , does that sound fall in the frequency that causes ear in humans ?"
22793,"yikes , i can imagine it does . that might be due to our da . humane began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity around 50000 years ago . i sure this was picked up then . . . haha"
22794,thats ' been a long time ! what benefit do you think there is if humans were able to synthesize our own vitamin c like animals and plants do ? the only thing i can think of is probably savings on orange juice purchases .
22795,i did not know that . did you now that humans are adapted for persistence hunting making them among the best distance runners among all running animals ? hard to imagine shall animals .
22796,"human being adapted for distance runners ? wow , i 'm really out of shape then and need o start hitting she you because if i ran event for one minute straight , i start painting like crazy . how about yourself ?"
22797,i 'm going to get back in shape . i assume are earlier ancestors we in decent shape since all they could do was walk around an try to survive . they would have been called hominins . do you follow the history of humans ?
22798,"i do n't follow much history about humans but i do follow politics an 'the colors red adn blue used to signify republicans and democrats have only been in use since the 2000s , i thought i existed forever ! when do you think the animals were introduced ?"
22799,i would imagine back in 1975 when truman refused to be photographed while riding a dumbo ride so e would n't be associated with republicans .
22800,i think you may have a great p ; goint but could be earlier than that since there has n't been a us president who wa n't a republican or democrat since the 1940s !
22801,"helo there , i hope yu are doing well . are you a fan of ed sheeran ?"
22802,"i like some of his songs , so not so much . how about you ?"
22803,"not too much , but i do think he is very talented dad o you hear that antiabortion campaigns have used one of his songs ti advocate for their own cars e ?"
22804,yes and it was actually a miscarriages .
22805,yeah sounds like he wrote it about a friend who had one . did you know bruce springsteen once subjected to someone using one of his songs ?
22806,"yes i wonder why they want sue them to stop using them , but i guess they can be used as songs as there is no financial gain ?"
22807,"yeah oi might be right , i kno in i was an artist i would n't like it . a politician used it for their campaign ."
22808,its interesting that the republican party in the 1800 's is more like the democrats of today .
22809,"that is funny , did you know that every president with a beard has been republican ?"
22810,or how about democrat or republican presidents since 1853 . where is the other parties ?
22811,"yeah to not have a president outside of those two parties is not cool . we need to come together and change that , have more than those options and not feel liek you are throwing away a vote ."
22812,i vote third party in he last presidential elections because i did n't like either candidate . i didnt feel like i was wasting my core .
22813,"i voted the sam myself in the last , i think that is just how teh majority of people think ."
22814,how about ed sheeran having a better vocal range than fredie mercury or giving a hit song to justin bieber .
22815,an that is pretty wild to think about . i guess he also claims eminem i sa huge influence .
22816,i wonder why eminem would b lean influence . i would have never guest that .
22817,"i know right , i thought the same thing . their musical styles are so different ."
22818,i guess creative types get their inspiration from many different areas so maybe its not so weird after all .
22819,"that is true . did you know he wrote and recorded the song i see fire , for the movie teh hobbit , in one day , that is impressive ."
22820,air once saw a documentary on him doing it shows . he seemed to have limitless engergy so i ca unsee that happening .
22821,"that must have been pretty interesting . well it was nice talking with you , i hope you enjoy the rest of the day ."
22822,"good morning ! call me crazy but , ed sheeran 's song ' smell bump ' has seem rather unusual lyrics for a man o sing . at 4 months there 's really no bump ."
22823,smart is pretty weird . i do n't thin of 've heard that on a ed sheeran considers eminem as one of his biggest musical influences . i do n't think they sound too similar . .
22824,"icy a n't say i 'd recognize him in a lineup or that one particular song of his i could pinpoint a shop . i would however recognize eminem an his work haha . rumor has it sheeran has a better vocal range than freddie mercury . that 's a bold comparison , do n't ya think ?"
22825,that 's definitely a little bold . i 'm not sure i 've heard anything that good from him . did you know he gave one of his songs to justin bieber ?
22826,"no , i did not . justin bieber i 've always considered a singer who appeals to tween girls and single crazy cat ladies , no ta legitimate muscian . . . same with sheeran . it 's amazing what wills old to some demographic s ."
22827,"yeah , that 's true . dod you know you can regrow part of your rib ?"
22828,no ! now i wonde why anyone would have tshirt rib shorten ? ! i also wonder why humans may ahve lost yet magically regrow body hair within the past 240k years
22829,"era , that 's pretty strange . the human body is very complex and confusing . did you know there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans ?"
22830,"i did know that . we are born with only two fears loud noise and falling . the rest i legitimately learned fears . kinda like people who are afraid to speck of politics . . . if a person is scared , there 's a reason for such ! which side of the proverbial fence do god consider yourself to stand on ?"
22831,i think there 's many fears one can be born with . i think fear spare primitive ways of helping us avoid danger and survive .
22832,maybe . haha i can ; t really pinpoint what my biggest ' fear ' was before maybe the us of 3 . did you know only republican presidents wore beards ?
22833,i did n't know that . did you know harry truman refused t be photographed on dumbo a sit would beam associated wit republicans ?
22834,"i did not know that . i do recall the symbols of the two parties being either a donkey or an elephant , not merely red so blue . i think those symbols are rather outdated and are due for a change ."
22835,thats are . there hasnt even a president since 1895 tha nwas not republican or democrat .
22836,i 've never understood why some people identify solely as one or the other . i cant really claim allegiance to on end the other as there 's not ne person love who i agree with every . single . thing . i .
22837,"yeah , i do believe life isn ot just blacks nd white an doyou can ' r just stick to one side the entire time just for the sake of loyalty ."
22838,humans allegedly began exhibiting behavioral modernity 50k years ago . cool it be we as a species are progressing ? ! losing that little knack s we did our hair ? !
22839,"that 's interesting . did you know most plant sandra animals can synthesize their own vitamin i , but we can ot because of a defective gen e ."
22840,i new that . i 'm a huge lover of the ocean and all things nautica : scurvy didn ' just climb board vessel slow . did you ever watch the show last week tonight with john oliver ?

22957,i do n't know who he is . i 've heard the name but ca n't say that i would recognize any of his songs . was n't one about a hobbit or something ?
22958,i 'm not sure . lol i 'm not too familiar with him . i 'm reading up on him now . e sheeran cries eminem as one of his biggest music influences .
22959,that 's not helpful . i ca n't name an eminem song either . the only time i listen to music is when i take the grandson to school and otehr places . he likes teenager poo stuff but they rarely announce the artist name . so who knows what i 'm listening to . is sheeran the guy who slept rough near buckingham palace for a couple years ?
22960,i could n't honestly tell you . lol he way a better vocal range than freddie mercury . do you know much about the republican party ?
22961,"i know that lincoln was a republican and that they have changed from right to left and back , who knows how many time s ? washout barry goldwater a famous republican ?"
22962,i believe he was . there has n't been a us president who was n't a republican r a democrat since 1853 .
22963,"those two parties do have a firm hold . nowadays we talk about red adn blue states for teh two parties . i can never keep it straight . i think red is a nice , stronger color but politically i 'm pretty blue ."
22964,noce . did you know that consistent use of red and blue colors only started in 2000 ? i could have swore i saw it a lot before then .
22965,i guess that i 'm just a slow learner . i wonder how far back hte elephant and donkey as mascots goes . i know in the 60 when truman went to disney land he made sure there was no dumbo in the background of any photos .
22966,"fast 's a funny story ! before trump , the last time a republican was elected president without a nixon or bush on the ticket was 1928 !"
22967,"buy thay take the record fir only presidnet to resign , nixon . in the 1930 ' 'the northeast and midwest werid republican stronghodls . now the northeast is a lot of democrats want he south has gone republican ."
22968,lol true ! every us president with a beard has been a republican . i never noticed that .
22969,"i guess those old guys like washington did n't like beards . i wo n't comment on our current guy 's hair . i 'm sure it 's unique in dome way . but who knows what 's next in hair , supposedly we lost our body hair about 240 , 000 years ago . what 's next ?"
22970,lol that 's funny ! humans are adapted for persistence hunting making them among the best distance runners among all running animals .
22971,unlike hte cheetah that can make a really fast burst of s ; peed but then has to rest for a while . the otehr thing about our hunting is we use tools a lot more than other animals . and i think we are sneaker . especially our politicians .
22972,yes ! ahha there is z souds frequency that causes fear in humans .
22973,so why do n't get at set up some giant speakers and name the other away run away . maybe get a punk band to play that sound .
22974,", lol humans will regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 2 to 3 months of haven it surgically shortened . odd fact of the day , it 's been fun chatting !"

22980,"i do n't know , i know pink floyd 's dark side of the moon was still going strong in 2014 ."
22981,that is crazy ! hasnt hat been out for nike 40 years now ? i think linkin park topped them though .

22994,i do n't know who that is . is he latin ?
22995,he 's a pop artist . i think he is filipino but i could see won . he was named after a professional wrestler though hah .
22996,"weird . i guess that 's almost as bad as starting out ws an elvis impersonator . ,"
22997,"you have to start somewhere . maybe i should do that too ? haha ot was nice chatting , have a great day !"
22998,hey do you listen to any albums ? i guess hte vinyl album started in the 1972
22999,i like a lot of albums ! apparently walmart will only sell clean ones thoug h !
23000,"ya that is very weird , would you buy hte a ; bum from those identical japanese twins ? they were 100 years old when they made it haah"
23001,"i have never heard of that album , what is it like ?"
23002,"ya i havent ' heard it , it 's probably really weird and hard to fins , it was made back in 1975"
23003,that is not too old ! led zeppelin once did not like an album to confuse the rock press
23004,"that is awesome , i love led zeppelin , did you ever listen to straight outta compton ?"
23005,"i did not , well maybe just the one song , why ?"
23006,well ya they got it to platinum status without any radio play apparently which s impressive

23008,"haha it must be ! i do love pink floyd , a nd i like knowing that dark side of the moon is still a best selling album in 2014 !"
23009,"bob marley was on the charts for over 914 weeks , that is long time appeal !"
23010,"that is crazy ! that record is a classic , do you like the planet mars bt w ? you know it was named for the god of war ?"
23011,"i know a big about mars , i know that there is a dwarf planet between it and jupiter !"
23012,"wow that is cool , also cool is sounds on mars have a higher pitch than on earth , kind of crazy !"
23013,"is that true ? that is very interesting , it have heard that sunsets are blue there as well , od placed !"
23014,"ya start seems screwy , also screwy is there is a mars colonization project theyre making for 2023 , apparently it will be based o na reality tv show haha"
23015,really ? that news to me ! i heard some of the aluminum from the to was used to explore mars
23016,"oh wow hat is interesting , what is crazy is that if you travelled at 1g acceleration , itd ' only take 3 days to get to mars"
23017,"how fast is 1g ? i know the curiosity rover sings itself happy birthday , whuch is cute !"
23018,haha well it is probably pasta actually l what is cool is that lichens from earth would actually be able to life on mars

23020,"ya i agree , i want to visit mars ! mind of dumb nasa mixed up imperial and is metric system and that caused a lost satellite"

23026,"he 's puerto rican and filipino . however , i think it 's ridiculous . i 've never thought that about him . ."

23028,"i agri . shaun king phd a valid question , should bruno not be allowed to sing ' ?"
23029,"h obviously should . i think a lot of the arguments are ridiculous , as well ."

23040,i do n't go to many but my husband surprised me with tickets .
23041,you have inspired me to go to more . great speaking with you .
23042,'s 's it going ? did you know mars is the second smallest planet in he solar system after mercury ?
23043,. did actually . did you kno wthe mars is the fourth plane from the sun .
23044,"yea , mars is quite an interesting planet with the impact craters , valleys , deserts , and polls ice caps it has"
23045,it really is quite interesting .
23046,". sure is , sounds on mars have higher pitch due to the differences in atmosphere"
23047,well opera singer would probably love to sing ip there huh .
23048,"opera singers , lichens , and cyanobacteria , all 3 would thrive on mars"
23049,lol . they would all get to enjoy a blue sunset as well .
23050,"i wonder if the will be a way to reach marx using 1g acceleration , then peopel can visit in 3 days"
23051,im not sure ut count me out . ill just styl here safely on planet earth .
23052,"well i ' r definitely avoid it if locheed martin designs the ship , theyd abused a satellite to crash on mars from using the wrong measuring system"
23053,sounds like he needs a new line of work . did you know that there is a curiosity robot on mars .
23054,"yea , 've heat a litle about it , and also the mars colonization project which will also be a reality show too"
23055,that sounds like something i could actually hatch .
23056,"probably be better than watching bruno mars , e ever if he does write his own music"
23057,i agree im not his biggest fan . bruno was actually interviewed on mtv when he was 4 years old .
23058,"that 's interesting , mars was also named after wrestler bruno sammartino"
23059,i didnt know that . apparently he has been an entertainer for a long time . he play elvis in am movie i 1919 .
23060,"he was also signed and dropped y motown records , ge 's and an interesting life"
23061,yes he has .
23062,"well i have to go , nice talking with you"
23063,did you watch the grammy 2016 awards ?
23064,yes . in was held in lo angeles on feb 0 .
23065,"thee 90th grammy awards , cant believe its been 50 years already , many history behind the awards"
23066,yeah . so many at work and lot of creativity and dedication to their work .
23067,"a lot of dedication i agree with you there , what do you think ot the winners ?"
23068,lot of creativity and thinking different from others and hard work .
23069,i think that bruno mars nailed it with his song `` thats what i like '' it won the award for best song
23070,"in my blood , also good . you hear . or not ?"
23071,"i thought it was good yeah and what abot 240k magic ? nice song , great rather ."
23072,"bruno mars record of the year . he is multiinstrumentalist , record produce , and dancer . he is know for his stage performance ."
23073,do you like him as an artist ? he is pretty young born in the year 1985
23074,his performances is amazing surely we want to accept his talent . ' hybrid theory ' is the best selling album of the 21st century .
23075,it is ? that is a great album i wonde if one of mars albums is close in sales to that one
23076,an slum is a collection of audio recordings issued as a collection on dvd . it 's developed mn 20th century .
23077,"wow , seems like albums have a lot of history ,"
23078,yeah . you know another mars . it is a fourth planet in the solar planet . it lso called red plant because it is always hot .
23079,"must be a living hell , there i sa project to colonize mars , its happening in the year 2023 , that will be an interesting show to watch ."
23080,nonclasical 240k magic bruno mars producer of the year . leonard borstein best engineers album .
23081,"thats another grea thats lol , i wonder how run mars will sound in mars , the plane ha higher pitches than earth"
23082,amazing . very nice chatting with you . have a great day .
23083,"you too have a great day bye ,"
23084,"hi ! i do agree with tom prez that bleak women are in fact that backbone of hte democratic party . if they do manage to pull off an lure wave , the democrats should thank black women for it ."
23085,"thaat 's an interesting point of view . i try to avoid anything political , it 's too depressing , lately ."
23086,what ; s cray is there has n't been a non republican or non democrat president since 1853 . theyve ll been either republicans or democrats !
23087,"i know , the consistent use of the red and blue colors for the republican and democratic parties only started in 2000 ."
23088,wow ! i was n't aware of that . i just assumed those were always the party 's colors ; it 's also crazy knowing there has never been a nonrepublican president with a beard .
23089,"in 1957 president harry truman visited disneyland and refused to be photographed on the dumbo ride so he would n't be associated with the republicans . and people talk about grumpy ewing childish , it 's always went on . lol"
23090,agreed . crazy to think that happened in the 1960s especially when figures seemed more mature . it 's hte nature of the beast i suppose . politicians ahve to do whatever satisfied their base . like i couldnt believe regan campaigned for democrats and was once against high corporate profits !
23091,"ye s , it 's gotten so divided in the country , its ' sad . reagan was good in that respect . he could honestly campaign for someone from a different party ."
23092,i know . it 's so t think people would n't dare do that these may . i was when sur ; risked to learn democrats make up 15 percent of th party !
23093,"yeah , you do n't hear too much about the tea party anymore , though ."
23094,true ! just like i had never heard the democratic party was the world 's oldest active political ; try . i always assumed it was teh republican party since riot ' preferred to as the ' grand ole party ' ?
23095,i didn ' know that either . did you know that the astronauts vote from space ?
23096,is that so ? that 's very interesting as it saves them from doing to worry about not being able to vote . i guess ot 's better to or from space ton in a lion infested single like the indian government does for a single voter . that is plain wrong !
23097,that is plain wrong . i read somewhere that 34 percent of the balck al population in alabama have permanently lost the right to vote . how does that even happen ?
23098,that 's a good question . especially when you consider black men gave 93 percent of their votes to doug jones in theyd veep red state of alabama .
23099,true . did you know that not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918 ?
23100,"really ? i wonder why that is ? ca n't help but wonder now the if not all men ha the rights o vote in austin , texas , would their garbage dump had been renamed freddi burst ? ha !"
23101,that 's too funny . i wonder how honored freed durst eels having teh dump named after him ?
23102,"h ! i bet he is n't too happy about that . just like many are n't happy about republicans losing 'the popular vote in the , and 6 out of 7 presidential elections ."
23103,"ye s , they are lots of the disgruntled about the republicans losing the popular vote but winning the election . reread how your electoral system works , people . it was setup this way for a reason ."
23104,"great is so true ! i mean , the party was founded by antislavery activist soso it dies n't bother me if they lose the popular vote , or any party for that matter . well it 's been nice chatting with you ! take care !"
23105,did you see how democrats won the house in the last election n ? apparently peopple think it 's because black women were voting for them in large numbers
23106,i did see that . interesting stats . seems like that percentages are tipped to where people are voting for their brown race .
23107,"yep tthat is what t seems like . for instance with black men , they made up 11 percent of the electorate but 93 percent of theme voted for democrat doug jones"
23108,kind of crazy . did you know that hillary clinton was president o young republicans i college ? funny she ended up being a democrat .
23109,no i didnt ' know that . but what is interesting us that every president that has ever had a beard has been a republican
23110,that is interesting ! n ever put 2 and 2 together . the us congress has played a republicans vs democrats basebal lame annually since 1909 with the republicans hold a slight edge with 3 more wins that teh democrats .
23111,"well that 's interesting . what do you think about teh fact hat republicans nad democrats have always been a president sine 1853 , before that they were called other names"
23112,"i did n't know that . how interesting . since ww2 the us economy consistently performs better under democratic presidents . interesting stat . ,"
23113,"yeah tha is interesting . it 's also interesting that the colors red and blue have only been associated with republicans and democrats since about the year 2000 , i always bought it was much longer than that"
23114,wow . you 're right . . . i thought it was much longest soo . another funny swithceroo . . . . ronald reagan was originally a democrat but switched over to be a republican .
23115,"yeah that is interesting , originally hew would campaign for democrats and he would campaign against corporate profits and low wages , very shocking"
23116,interesting . supposedly republicans are statistically more educated than democrats .
23117,well you have a lot of great facts do n't you have . what do you think about voting though ? i you know that astronauts can vote from space
23118,"i did n't know that . lol i do see where sa chimpanzee received 400 , 000 votes in a mayoral election in rio de janeiro . lol"
23119,"wow that 's funny lol i wonder if he did a good job being the mayor lol . did you know that in india they set up a polling booth for only one person , it as in a forest full of lions lol"
23120,"lol what were they thinking ? lol if all of canada was one state int he us , it would only have 50 electoral votes which is fewer than california ."
23121,"wow that 's crazy ! what scares me though is that only in 1918 did all men in the united kingdom finally havent eh right to vote , i wonder what was holding it up"
23122,that is weird . maybe because they were still ruled by a king and queen ?
23123,"i 'm not 100 percent sure about that , what i do know is tha tin alabama , 34 percent of the black male population ca n't even note"
23124,wow . why is that ?
23125,"i think they lose the ability to note into they go into prison , and so that is why they ca n't vote anymore"
23126,"hi , how are you ? are lou interested in politics ?"
23127,"i am interested in it , but i know you have to tread carefully around it ."
23128,"yes , many people have strong opinions on the matter , but in these chats , we can safely exchange opinions . the two parties are not enough for the country . agree ?"
23129,that i can agree on . difficult to see it changing . the democrats and republicans have the system so up .
23130,"yes , the money flows to them adn those outside the system can not get in without , money . too bad ."
23131,"i know there have bee third party , or independent candidates , hader , per , but they just act as spoilers and never hav a real chance ."
23132,i dont now waht else they could do except maybe run for a different office like senator or governor . i think people want someone that can change thigns rapidly but that is not possible .
23133,"how about some voting facts ? a chump received 400 , 000 votes in brazil once ."
23134,the chimp probably did have some good social policies . better than his opponents . plus people like chimps . especially when they wear tuxedo .
23135,"maybe all votes should be base don novelty clothes . here 's always these animals gaining political office , i edward of a dog that passes away last like that was a three time mayor of some town somewhere in america"
23136,"th dog was a good boy , on so the best , a was always ready to play fetch . house trained . perfect for the office ."
23137,house trained sould be the very basic requirement . that would be an interesting question m6 the presidential debates .
23138,i think most of trump 's family would do in . dont know about trump though . the 2020 election ought to be interesting .
23139,"in terms of civility , yes . i ca n't see it being a 99 . 85 percent vote to either candidate , like in the norwegian referendum ."
23140,we coul drake a law that would mandate vgotign . that would be interesting .
23141,when 40 percent of a state votes against he interracial marriage that might not be the best idea .
23142,"yes , but then peope would yet the govt that they deserve . they can not complain tthat tell did not participate ."
23143,i know in australia you get fine if you do n't vote .
23144,"yeah , it heard that . the idea is hat its your govt , you need to choose . i like it . anyway , great chat"
23145,"same her , and we did n't tell at each other about ethic other stupid beliefs ."
23146,"yes , i get tired of the yelling . im sure you and i disagree on many thing , but selling has never changed another persons mind ."
23147,have a good evening f farewell .
23148,"hi , do you know who bruno mars is ?"
23149,i do . he is my favorite music artist . who is your favorite singer ?
23150,"i am a bit older , so i am not up on current singers . one of my old favorites was jarvis jovi of what kind of songs does mars sing ."
23151,i believe he mostly sings hip hop and funk . did you know that bruno mars writes his own music ?
23152,no i did n't . i have tried to imagine how someone can put together a ; piece of music . i guess you either have that talent or you do n't .
23153,"yep , bruno mars was actually named after the professional wrestler bruno sammartino"
23154,that is interesting . were his parents just big sammartino fan or what ?
23155,"not sure , but bruno mars was originally an elvis impersonator . talk about ironic ."
23156,wow ! that is a big surprise . we from what i understand his signs are nothing like elvis ?
23157,"i agree , they are pretty different from elvis 's . bruno mars 's music is pretty original , and it is paired up with the excellent dancing skills"
23158,ill have to listen to some of his music . i 'm always open to new music . which of his songs would you suggest for an old rocker like me ?
23159,"i am not sure since i am not the biggest music fan out there . however , i believe queen has had ome huge hits like bohemian rhapsody ."
23160,nwa queen i am familiar with . but speaking of mars did you know that sounds on mars have a higher pitch than on earth ?
23161,"is it because of the atmosphere on mars ? maybe after we colonize mars , we an experiment with the difference of the pitches ."
23162,yes . i hope i live tos lee us land on mars . i understand a colonization project is planned for 2023 .
23163,it was spacex 's ambitious plan right ? i really hope that we can colonize mars before th land of the 21st century . i would like to visit mars one day .
23164,yes i think it . tha would be wear would n't it . some people think we are rom mars but had to leave because teh lost their atmosphere .
23165,"yep , nad since there are polar icecaps on mars , we could have come from mars as there used to be life o mars ."
23166,they say it could currently still be supporting life such as lichens and cyanobacteria . we would just newt jlo restore the atmosphere nad there we are .
23167,it would only take us 23 uav to fly to mars under 1g of acceleration . that is a very fast speed !
23168,that is fast if they can do it . hte length of time for the trip has been a major drawback .
23169,"currently it will take a few months to get to mars . if we do manage to colonize mars , getting aid to mars will from to be a difficult challenge when mars is faced with an emergency"
23170,i would think that we would send several unmanned supply trips before the colonization starts so the would be an example amount of supplies already there .
23171,"i agree , an maybe on some robots that could help organize those supplies , although i do not think robot technology is able to o that right now ."
23172,robots would be good . i do n't think we are far away from that technology right now . look at what they 're doing with self driving cars .
23173,"google 's self driving cars have proven themselves o nthe field , although i still think that it will take time fort he governments o allow people to win these cars ."
23174,i agree . i have been driving so long i probably would n't want one . but i could see them doing long range over teh road trucking .
23175,"that woudl cut the cost of trnzasport by a lot , not i am sure that there will be much job loss attributed tot he success of self driving cars ."
23176,"that is a definite downside . it 's really been great chatting with you , but i 'm afraid i ahve to say good night ."
23177,"hello , were you aware that fix news thought of creating a channel taht would only air the simpsons ? how cool would that be ?"
23178,aha yes i would watch that ! kind of crazy that get more views than cnn and msnbc combined
23179,"i would as well . what 's hilarious , is that it threatened 5o sue these simpsons , to stop them from doing parodies sofa their antidem agenda . that 's unreal ."
23180,"ya that sounds really dumb , also weird that richard nixon was a founder of cox news"
23181,"taht is surprising , i did n't know taht he and picard holes were friends ."
23182,"ya i did n't know that either , its interesting its in 86 countries , so a lot more than just the usa"
23183,"if i 'm not mistake n , the international markets have fox extra segments during commercial breaks . i guess they are everywhere ."
23184,"ya it would seem so , do you ever do fantasy football ?"
23185,i do not . i 'm more into poetry an classical music . dis you know shakespeare invented the name miranda ?
23186,"i did n't thats impressive , crazy that he and pocahontas swede alive at t sesame time period"
23187,"what ' crazier , is that everything we know about him privately , has been restored by other s ."
23188,"ya he i still a mystery , and yes he also invented th names olivia and jessica"
23189,"it really makes you wonder . the same with tchaikowsky , h e donated his skull to the shakespeare company . to be used as a prop . people were so strange back then ."
23190,"ya that is screwy , also screwy is that in his time people had a different accent and way to pronounce thing s so things that do n't rhyme now woudl have rhymes back in his day"
23191,that 's why modern translations often do n't make and sense . kinda like how people do the fantasy draft of the national spelling be .
23192,"haha , ya they even have fantasy politic s , liken have people will be in anything haha"
23193,"at this point , 8 bet the fantasy politics isp better than real , lol . then again , i guess it 's the alluded of the wealth . like that on emily who won the lottery and bought a watermarks ."
23194,"haha that sounds awesome ! h ave you rover read anything by terry pratchett ? i guess he was knighted , so his books must be good"
23195,"no , i have n't even heard of him . is his work anything like that janitor in chicago , who wrote a 15 , 000 page fantasy manuscript ?"
23196,"i do n't know , but that janitor also in over 300 watercolor paintings in the book , it sounds kind of awesome actually"
23197,"it truly does . i 'm always in awe of people who can do things like that . thank you for chatting with me , have a wonderful evening ."
23198,"you too , and be careful with fantasy stuff , only a single brain fold is the difference between realizing something is fantasy or reality !"
23199,do god think lotto winners should eb obligated to make their hame pulic ?
23200,no . it invites criminals and other slime . should should be able to remain anonymous . i really think it 's a safety issue . i do n't buy the argument of te lottery people .
23201,"do you think people would believe that there was actually a winner , if it was not disclosed who it was ?"
23202,i do n't know but it 's not worth getting someone killed . the lottery company could prove to some independent agent that 's sworn o secrecy .
23203,that is a good idea . the law might not be on her side according to open records laws . you can form an anonymous trust but needs to be be done before signing her name .
23204,yeah m i'ts am guess . i guess i would argue the case of personal safety because there are some horror stories of lottery winners being the victims of crime .
23205,"yeah , and lottery runners often get swindled ."
23206,yep . so are you into fantasy stuff . i really did like ' the lord of the rings ' . it 's the only fantasy film to win the academy award for best picture .
23207,"not that , but . i do like a good fantasy i i can really get ino thoug hp a single fold in the brain cakes the difference between snowing reality from fantasy ."
23208,some people in politics seem to be missing thet feature . wow there is a university where one can actually study scifi and fantasy . . . wonder what school has that ? in la no doubt t . .
23209,some people take fantasy seriously . comedic fantasy author terry pratchett was knighted for his services to literature .
23210,i thin theme is a case for rookies int hat regard . he forest hitler and ww ii though fantasy . henson used it to teach children to some degree . . .
23211,interesting . did 3joliam shakespeare write any fantasy ?
23212,i would say he had characters that were fantastic but not really a fantasy writer . funny that he intentionally made grammatical errors to get the audience 's attention n .
23213,"and a lot of phrases he coined are still in use today like laughing stock , wild good chase and good riddance ."
23214,"9 thunk he proved that human nature is a very changing thing . wow , there are 33 shakespeare gardens that only grow stuff that he mentioned . stay clear of the sherlock !"
23215,"i would love to visit . theresa re also several popular names that were invented diy him like jessica , olivia and miranda ."
23216,cool . i recently read that many is 85 percent dedicated to opinion . i 'm skeptical . . . that only allows for 15 percent being dedicated to news .
23217,interesting . apparently fox news is watched more than cnn and msnbc combined .
23218,that i actual ; y knew in hat 's why i do n't believe that the median view age is 68 for fox news . that does n't even make sense unless there are a lot of 100 plug 6yearold out there .
23219,they discussed the possibility of making a cable channel tha would only air the simpsons . would you watch ?
23220,i like the simpsons so yes . . . i team on my laptop more than i watch tv .
23221,"speaking of which , i 'm in the mood to watch these simpsons wh ave a good night !"
23222,"hi , do you like fantasy ?"
23223,not really . i prefer comedy . how about you ?
23224,yeah somewhat . did you know people fantasy draft the spelling bee
23225,i did n't know that . o you like the lord of the king ? the return of the big is the first nd only fantasy film to ever get an academy award for best picture .
23226,i actually like it a lot . do you know hat keeps the reality from fantasy separate in us ?
23227,i 'm not sure . what is it ? jim henson made ' the black crystal l ' because he felt taht children should never be afraid ; . he wanted them to return to fantasy 's darker roots like hans christian andersen tales .
23228,wow did not know that . do you like any news channels ?
23229,i prefer not to wath the news . i find it depressing . how about you ?
23230,yeah me too but i heard fox news is the most watched
23231,i hear the median viewer age is 68 though
23232,do you know who created it ?
23233,who created it ?
23234,richard nixon and richard ankles
23235,interesting . i didn ot know that . to news threatened to sue the simpsons because they did n't like them parodying their anti democratic party agenda .
23236,yeah and at the sam time they want to create a channel to play only simpsons
23237,"ha , interesting . would you watch tv all day if you won the lottery ? travel ? do something else ?"
23238,definitely travel and maybe try and catch some shakespeare dreams
23239,is theres a such thing as too much money though ? there was a lottery winner who wanted to remain anonymous . there have been reports o lottery winners getting killed after they disclosed their names .
23240,ow did not know that . did you know shakespeare made up a bunch of women 's names
23241,i did not know that . h also mad grammatical errors on purpose to emphasize points in his plays .
23242,hat is remarkable . nice chat
23243,hi ! do you play any sports ?
23244,"not really so much anymore , but i used to . how about you ?"
23245,i used to play volleyball but wih only three players instead of a like what is typically played adn we always tried to slam the ball .
23246,that 's pretty interesting ? did you know that volleyball and basketball were both invented at teh ymca ?
23247,"i did n't know taht ! i wonder if hey patented or licensed those inventions ! i knew that our local ymca basketball height was the same regardless of gender , but was n't the same for volleyball ones , the women 's nets were much shorter . do you think that 's fair or reasonable ?"
23248,that 's not too fair . they say that the best female volleyball player in the world is nicknamed ' game over . '
23249,"lo l , that 's a great nickname ! that would definitely strike a sense of intimidation and fear in me if i new that the opposing team has a player like that . maybe she got her nickname by kicking the volleyball , it 's actually not against the rules to do that !"
23250,"that 's pretty interesting , so i guess you can use any part of your body in volleyball ?"
23251,"yeah , none of it is against the rules , that would 've been useful to know since my wrist were in so much pain from hitting the ball ."
23252,i bet . did you hear that fedex actually returned a volleyball that washed up after the japanese tsunami ?
23253,how dd they knows ho to return it to ? i 'm glad no sharks got ahold o that treasures volleyball . sharks were existent even before dinosaurs and trees !
23254,"i was wondering that myself . sharks are a , making ! they can be trained like dogs to bark !"
23255,"tobey can bark ? i think i 'd be too afraid to wait and listen to their sounds the moment i see their mouth open and sharp teeth even though they can rescue sailors , like dolphins . i think i 'd much prefer to hitch a ride with dolphin strands sharks , you ?"
23256,"yeah , i 'd feel safer with the nfl ; pins than the sharks . apparently great white sharks congregate in the middle if the pacific ocean in an area known as the white sharks cafe . i do n't think i 'd at to go there , i have a feeling that i 'd be the extreme ."
23257,"lol , as friendly as it sounds fo enter that cafe , i would ' g want to enter either even though htey have no rib cages , their massive size can cause them to literally crushes their own bodies , i wonder if any other animals have nor rib cages likes sharks ."
23258,"that 's pretty interesting , i wonder if wikileaks leaked that information . wikileaks actually published the government 's plans to destroy wikileaks ."
23259,was it in those documents that revealed that 86 percent of teh land in nevada is owned by th is government ?
23260,i 'm not sure about that . i wonder if most of the land there consist of military bases and test sites ? i mean area 51 is there i believe .
23261,"76ers , i think tha 's what its used for mainly , but maybe it in those wiki , peaks that reveal th factual purpose of housing bases there and perhaps even information regarding whether anyone ahs attempted to sled the statue of liberty like am an in france who managed to sell the eiffel tower twice ! i wonder who the prospective buyers were ."
23262,"that is pretty crazy , what would be even crazier is a it was the same buyer both times ."
23263,"yeah , but hopefully those documents real how much the us government has done , maybe something like the norwegian government where trey donated one billion to help save the amazon rainforest !"
23264,are you familiar with computers ?
23265,yeah . use them all the time . wish i could use one in the pool .
23266,"that 's too bad , they 're not waterproof . but they can easily carry out tasks called programs ."
23267,well i was thinking of that because the russians made a computer that runs on water .
23268,"oh really , i think i heard something something about it now i think about it , what year was it ?"
23269,"1936 . you ca n't even smoke in font f an apple , s o what the russians did is pretty impressive ."
23270,"well , technically you can make in front of an apple , you just void the warranty , which i guess is a bad thing as well ."
23271,"ahh , i see . well , better not to smoke ."
23272,"ya , scientists have done manly research on it"
23273,i hear bones become magnetic when exposed to radiation . so scientists measured them in order to determine how much radiation people absorbed in hiroshima
23274,"realy ? akihito , the emperor of japan is a scientist and he still publishes papers ."
23275,"taht i impressive . not as impressive as walking on the moon , like harrison schmitt did , but impressive nonetheless"
23276,harvard scientists have also managed to store a gif of a galloping horse in some dna .
23277,ha hq . too much time on their hands ? thaat should definitely be in sacremento 's library of things
23278,"i must be a pretty big achievement to ahve done had , i do n't think they would give it to the library of things ."
23279,what if it were a library founded by william gladstone ?
23280,"sell , william gladstone 's library only had books , though there were about 3 a , 000 books , which is still impressive ."
23281,"yeah , you 'd need a big as hebarrow to get them all there"
23282,"it was 3 or 4 of a mile , must eb a hard task for a man aged 58 ."
23283,"yeah . he should 've just passed norway to do i t , since they are always distribution books tolt library"
23284,"that sounds like a great idea ! anyways , it was nice talking to you ."
23285,hey there do you like going to the library ?
23286,i enjoy a good library . just got a great book about hiroshima and the atomic boom .
23287,"ah nice , ya i go all the time , i wish y library were like the one in th yuk thought here you can get things like sewing machine , that would be useful"
23288,i 've heard abot those . library of things they call them . there is one in sacramento
23289,"oh ice , maybe i should move there haah , ice to know that over half of adults have library cards though"
23290,reading is fundamental . did you ever heard about the man who was falsely convicted that used hi prison time to study la wat the library ?
23291,"lol , i did , and the he became a lawyer to help free other people , thats so nice !"
23292,i ended if it i worth it to publish is norway . you are guaranteed 1000 copies will e bought and distributed to libraries !
23293,"haha ye s , and 1500 if its a kids book , you 're guaranteed to make money !"
23294,true . i would like to find instruction on building a waterfrun computer like the russians built in 1936 .
23295,"ya i am so curious how that works , also how someone could upload their mind to a us drive"
23296,that is not so far out when you consider the space shuttle computer runs on 1mb of ram .
23297,"ya that is impressive , do you have an android or an iphone btw ?"
23298,"i use na iphone , even though one cannon smoke near one since that is a biohazard !"
23299,"right , i dont smoke but thats kind of crazy , did you know the emperor of japan is a scientist ?"
23300,i have heard tha tc scinetistsl ike john von neumann are amazing people .
23301,ya and akihito the emperor still publishes papers even today
23302,it is amazing the term scientist has only been around since 1833 .
23303,"ya thati nyt one , and for the record il love the scientist who invented the internet in 1989 , what a genius !"
23304,true . now they can even store binary software in bacteria dna !
23305,that is crazy ! and ya i wonder how they did that car of a galloping horse
23306,thinks . i think im going to o try some minecraft !
23307,you should ! and you should try making a 16 bit computer with the blocks !
23308,hi . do you like going to the library ? i think it ' scool how many things are available to borrow .
23309,i love going to the library but now a days i pretty much search and checks y books out online . it is amazing at what all is available at the library .
23310,gyess o much more convenient . yiu are right from newspapers to manuscripts to films even cd 's !
23311,i know and video games . did you know they are to lure the teenagers into the library with this ?
23312,quite funny i bet it works ! if you publish book in norway the government will guy 1000 copies and distribute the it libraries . i wonder if they do the same with children ? s books ?
23313,hmmm . not sure . all ships visiting the ancient city of alexadnria had to surrender their books for immediate copying . then they put the originals in the library of alexandria .
23314,oh wow . interesting . one cool fact is that there are more libraries that mcdonalds which makes me have hope for us !
23315,thank goodness ! ! did you know that a hambone revealed how much radiation a hiroshima bomb victim absorbed . i am sure the results were frightening .
23316,that is fascinating but scary at the same time . i et a scientist came p witht hat idea . hard to believe it was n't until the 19th century that te germ scientist came into use .
23317,i am surprised at that ! i am also surprised that i did illegal to own a rabbit in queensland without having a magicians license or beings a scientist . what do they have against pet rabbits ?
23318,haha hilarious . there are too many wild rabbits there . only one scientist has ever walked on the moon . . . harrison schmitt .
23319,that is neat . i am amazed at scientists . did you know that harvard scientists managed tos tore a gif animation of a galloping horse in the dna of bacteria . how did they really know it was there ? sounds sketchy or
23320,sounds very sketchy ! the emperor of japan was a scientist and he still publishes papers !
23321,hmmm . did you know that the first computer algorithm was written by a woman named ada lovelace ?
23322,sounds likd epa hurry potter character lol ! i am thankful to the enlist scientist who invented the world wide web in 1989 !
23323,so is a gore ! lol .
23324,haha hilarious . that english scientist who discovered he web di lot with a statefunded organization . they should be proud .
23325,absolutely ! the fir google compute rat stanford was housed in lego bricks . not sure what that says !
23326,haha i would love to see that in action . do never smoke near apple computers as its is the warranty !
23327,i ha dino idea ; t hank goodness i do n't smoke . i am sure that o would be the one to void it if possible .
23328,haha maybe so . the russians even made a 9cmpyuter stat ran on water once . well on that note i will say goodbye . it was lovely talking with you .
23329,"hello , what 's of interest to you ?"
23330,i thinkk libraries are a fascinating entity . a entire building of resources tthat cna be borrowed fo free !
23331,me too although the internet has kept me out of them for years .
23332,yeah thats true most of the information cna be accessed online now . but one library in sacramento that things lke swing machines you can borrow
23333,"wow , that 's cool . i 've only been to a once . it woul cool if they did that with power tools ."
23334,hopefully more libraries will do that . whoa yeah power tools would be sweet and a great idea . they can be very expensive to buy .
23335,"yes , i do n't uae them enough to justify the expense ."
23336,"yeah and i did n't realize how many libraries there were in the us , more libraries than mcdonalds , and over half the population have library cards ."
23337,libraries are cool . i used to frequent them . it is the of the best things one can do for free .
23338,yeah i don ' 6 use them enough either . now computers can basically do everything and it 's basically like havent a library at home .
23339,"the internet and computers have taken on the role , perhaps too much . there is something satisfying about turning pages ."
23340,"yeah i agree . in addition , the technology continues to improve every day . transhumanists for example want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks !"
23341,"yeah , i heard that . as long as they stick to smart people like the english scientist that invented the www ."
23342,"yeah good point , i an ' imagine how smart that guy must wb !"
23343,smarter than em ! we also do n't really need weapon makers like the people hat built hte bomb that erased hiroshima .
23344,odd that 's true . atleast come good has come of it witht he brazilian physicist mascarenhas making all those advances with measuring radiation veep s .
23345,i worked in the emnulcear industry and radiation is scary . a dirty explosive would be enough to paralyzed a city .
23346,wow i ca n't imagine that ! have you ever been tested for radiation ?
23347,"we wore a told badge that was tested regularly , time lapse diameter , . kind of like they did to test people in 1945 ."
23348,oh that 's good . yeah the current technologyelectron spin resonate sounds pretty coo ; .
23349,yes . technology brooms . nice talking to you .
23350,you too thanks
23351,over and out . . .
