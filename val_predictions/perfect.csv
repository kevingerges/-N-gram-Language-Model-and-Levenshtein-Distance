0,are you a football fan ?
1,"yes , i'm . a football fan ."
2,did you now that the university of iowa's visiting football teams locker room is painted pink ?
3,"yes , i do . i think they want to intimidate the visiting teams ."
4,something like that would just make me mad and geek my team up ! you ?
5,"yes , lol . do you know about espn winning an emmy ?"
6,"yes and that superimposed line made life a little easier , lol ! hard to believe that there are only 11 minutes of live game play ."
7,"yes , what did they do the rest of the time ?"
8,i know right ! did you know that in the 60's top bowler made more than top nfl players ?
9,i do . they now make pennies compared to professional football players .
10,"i would hope so , just goes to show how little the nfl paid back then . do you know what the highest scoring football game was ?"
11,nfl or college football ?
12,think college back in the day when they wore those ridiculous helmets .
13,cumberland was defeated by georgia tech . the scores were 2220 . it was in 1916 .
14,"yup and i know my hint helped , lol . did you know in austria they call football rugby ?"
15,yes . i wonder why though . do you know why ?
16,apparently the different variations are called football codes . it's called other things in other countries .
17,"greenellis , an rb , has never fumbled the ball in his nfl career ."
18,now that's an achievement . do you know if he's in the hall of fame ?
19,"no , i do not think so other wise i would have heard ."
20,"do you watch tv at all ? it's just a mass medium for advertising , entertainment and news ."
21,"yes , i do watch television once a day . i like to watch national news . i've got to run now . great chats !"
22,"i love to watch tv , what about you ?"
23,"yes , sometimes . i watch the nfl a lot . while i'm not a fan of the redskins . i do like adrian peterson . he's a machine that can run and run , without fumbles ."
24,do you prefer watching nfl or attending the event ?
25,"i would prefer live it the weather's good . the bad thing is that the possibility of injury is a big concern , especially for qbs ."
26,ah see . most of the stadiums can be changed to indoors . . right ? i feel like people watch the game for the qb . .
27,i'm not sure how many are outdoors only . i like to watch managers and coaches like gruden . fun to see their reactions .
28,the pissed off reactions ?
29,sometimes . sometimes it's a happy reaction . like when brad johnson threw a td pass to himself in a superbowl !
30,"i don't really know how nfl came to be though . there's so many different variations of football that exist . . . rugby , gridiron , soccer . . . just so many"
31,i think there were college people that still wanted to play . 14 of the 25 largest stadiums are u . s . college stadiums .
32,with all the prevention on the high school level against concussions . . . isn't that the end of the game already if the parents don't want their kids to go into football ?
33,i played in hs and my parents made the call . my mom didn't like the idea . i didn't have my dad do the fight song like snoop dogg's son .
34,hopefully you are still throwing the ball around on your free time ?
35,"yeah , i do with my nephew and brother once in a while . my son's are far away unfortunately . i'm no qb through and not lefthanded like kellan moore , the only lefthanded qb in the nfl ,"
36,are you able to run and do carries like adrian peterson ?
37,"yeah , in my dreams . did you know that only two africanamerican qbs have won the superbowl . too bad warren moon didn't ."
38,there also seems to be more records being broken every year . . . especially when the patriots have been at the superbowl so many times . . .
39,yeah . i wonder in homer simpson has a record for having 188 jobs in 400 episodes ?
40,lol . gotta love the simpsons . been on the air for so long .
41,yeah . i still get a kick out of homer . i'm not much for things like ' the shark tank . ' i hear the deals they make are phony .
42,well a lot of people go on shark tank just to get the name out . i think that does wonder than actually get a deal with any of the members on shark tank .
43,"that's true . thanks , you were an excellent chat partner !"
44,hey there do you have a favorite quarterback ? i personally don't watch the nfl that much but i do like tom brady
45,i don't have a favorite qb . i guess brady just won the sb again . how many times is that ?
46,i think it's 6 at this point isn't it ? another quarterback i like is kellen moore . he's the only lefthanded quarterback in the league
47,why the small number of lefties ? does it have something to do with setting up the offense differently for a lefty ?
48,"it might be ? i wonder if it gives him an advantage or a disadvantage being lefthanded ? what quarterbacks are geniuses though like alex smith oh , have you heard of him"
49,alex smith ? what team does he play for ? why is he a genius ?
50,well he took a lot of ap tests when he was in high school and so he got into his university as a junior . then he got his bachelor's degree in only 2 years and was almost through his master's degree before becoming the first choice in the 2005 draft
51,"impressive . got through college that fast , then studied at the graduate level while playing ball ? bright guy ."
52,yes i think so . another interesting guy is baker mayfield . he's a quarterback and thought about becoming a professional gamer before finally getting drafted into the nfl
53,i wonder how many girls he would get as a gamer . seems like the popularity factor is better with the nfl .
54,"oh he made the right choice haha . another guy who made the right choice is paul d hubbard , he was a deaf quarterback and created the circular huddle that football players use today"
55,i guess i thought the huddle was something that was there from the beginning . a deaf qb ? i wonder how well he did .
56,"that's what i was wondering too . i guess maybe he could still yell out calls and different things like audibles , but you'd think that you would have to be hearing in order to be a quality quarterback . but he did invent the huddle so he's done more for football than me haha"
57,true . what do you think of u of iowa's locker room painting tactic ?
58,"i don't know , i'd be curious if that would help or hurt them . if i went into a locker room and it was painted tank it would make me mad and i would play better i think haha . what do you think ?"
59,"i would get mad too . if that tactic worked , then other teams would copy it ."
60,yep i think so . although i wonder if that's what happened for the highest scoring football game of all time . it was 222 to 0 maybe the winning team had the other team's locker room painted pink lol
61,that's true . or maybe somebody goofed when they made the schedule . why would gt do that to a team ? seems wrong .
62,i know right ! it's a hundred to zero i think the game is officially over haha . do you like the patriots at all ? i know they have a player that's never fumble the ball which i think is awesome
63,i hope he got a bonus for that feat . that's amazing . he must have special gloves or something . what's his name ?
64,"his name is benjarvis greenellis , and yes you must have a secret as to how he was able to pull that off haha although i would be very concerned every time i played because every game you play is a chance to ruin that record haha"
65,hello how are you doing ?
66,"hello , i am doing great , you ? do you like football ?"
67,i love it . did you know that top bowlers used to make more than football stars did ?
68,"i love it also ! that is interesting , i wonder how much more football players make now than bowlers"
69,i would say it is a whole lot these days .
70,i agree lol . did you know the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80 yard field in chicago
71,thats amazing . look what it has grown into . billions of dollars in it . millions and millions of fans . its great .
72,right ! now they even have chip technology in players should pads tracking data for them
73,that really is amazing technology . did you know that benjarvis green ellis has never fumbled in his career .
74,"i heard that before , that is a great feat ! he needs to teach a clinic to these new era rbs on how to hold on to the ball !"
75,well there had to be a touch of luck involved . he played for a long time .
76,for sure ! i liked his name lol . do you know the lions coach matt patricia ?
77,yeah didnt he use to coach in new england
78,"yea the assistant , now coaches the lions . the guy is a rocket scientist !"
79,really . i wonder if that helps him with football at all . other than having a really good mind .
80,i was thinking the same thing . do you watch college football at all ?
81,not really . i did hear that the university of iowas visiting locker room is painted pink . i thought that was pretty funny .
82,"that is true , i live down the street from that stadium . it is because pink has a natural calming effect on people who see it !"
83,yeah im sure thats why . lol .
84,"for sure , maybe why they are good at home for football . it was very nice chatting with you !"
85,nice chatting with you to . have a great day .
86,"hey how are you , you think cte is real ?"
87,"i think its real , players end up with brain damage and that is a sad thing"
88,"for sure , i wonder how much of it is in the player before they start too ? got to have something going on there to want to play in the nfl but yah , too many concussions is way too much and too many people getting hurt ."
89,"yeah traumatic brain injuries that are also difficult to diagnose , the symptoms take a long time to disappear ."
90,"they do , usually caused by repeated blows to the head , very difficult to diagnose indeed . it's something but no one wants to pay attention to it it seems ."
91,did you watch that movie the one with will smith ? i thought it was revealing and the game should evolve and change for the better
92,"what was that movie called again ? i did see it , was it called concussion right ?"
93,"yeah i think thats it , self explained name when you think about it and also ''chronic traumatic encephalopathy ' sounds like a serious condition ."
94,"that line ' tell the truth ' is pretty iconic in my opinion , it was a good movie for sure . made me view the nfl a bit different . i guess it makes us think if millions of dollars for a few years is worth all that ?"
95,"i don't think it is , i do love the game but think it should be safer for players . have you ever heard of gaelic football ?"
96,"i have not , what is gaelic football ? is it like rugby ?"
97,its another variation of football haven't watched it but i guess its also really interesting .
98,very interesting . i wonder if it has more than 11 minutes of live football like the nfl has on average per game .
99,"that is not a lot of time , the superbowl was really long lasted more than 3 hours"
100,"oh wow , that was such a boring super bowl though , tom brady is so good , and i'm not even a fan of his lol ."
101,"yeah , he is one of the best qb ever to play the game . engineers end up earning more money than football players"
102,"i could see that , i'm sure nfl players have a lot more fun in their 20s , maybe not so much their 40s and 50s though when they are so sore haha ."
103,"i have no idea about that lol , what are your thoughts on the tracking chips the players have embedded in their shoulders ."
104,"i think it's pretty cool , the chips help them with their analytics , that's why you see so many 3's in the nba now , they've studied all the data and for some people it's beneficial to lob 3s instead of jumpers ."
105,oh so you are basketball fan as well and yeah it is pretty cool all the interesting stats we can learn thanks to those chips .
106,"for sure , data is really changing the world . great talking with you though , i hope you have a great night ! take care !"
107,do you like sports ?
108,"i do , did you watch the superbowl last month ?"
109,it was okay
110,"i liked it , my favorite team was playing although it was a slow superbowl ."
111,which team ? how was their performance
112,"the patriots and their perfomance was good considerng they won , what do you think of brain damage and the game"
113,i like the patriots too . much like the lannisters of football
114,"they have dominated the nfl for a while so yeah , thats a valid analogy ,"
115,"ya and they have amazing players like brady . surprised he is still playing , but his performance is still solid"
116,"i agree , he is 40 years old but still one of the best qb on the league , wonder how much money he makes , must be a lot"
117,i hear his wife still makes more . power couple
118,she is a famous model or was a famous model to think engineers actually end up winning more than pro football players
119,i think it is due to the high rate of injury leading to early retirement for many players
120,"yeah , football players carreers seem to be short due to injuries , did you hear about the tracking chips they have ?"
121,in their shoulder pads or in the football ?
122,"both , i guess that they give all kinds of interesting stats ,"
123,i wonder if it is any help in reducing injuries
124,"i think it could , if you meassure the impact and then find a way to protect the players"
125,i don't think protective football gear has evolved much
126,"no , i hear they wanted to change certain rules to protect players but easier said than done ,"
127,"in any case , i hope less people get injured . thanks for chatting ."
128,are you a fan of nick foles and the eagles ?
129,no . i like the new york giants .
130,i remember the day when bowlers made more money than nfl players
131,really ? that is very surprising to me . when was this ?
132,i believe it was back in the 60s .
133,i have heard that the highest scoring football game was 2220
134,yeah that was a college game . i believe it was against a division ii team named cumberland
135,yep ! all the way back in 1916 .
136,this years football season has ended and now it is time for the playoffs .
137,the best team from the nfc will play the best team from the afc . this is called the superbowl .
138,do you prefer the american version of football or the english or australian versions ?
139,the american version for sure .
140,espn has added a field goal line to their emmy winning yellow line for first downs
141,i find it interesting there is no rule preventing women from playing in the nfl .
142,"i hope to see one in the nfl sooner , at least as a kicker"
143,that would be interesting . you may be surprised to know that a typical nfl game only has 11 minutes of gameplay .
144,"yeah , i spend hours in front of the tv only to be watching a few short minutes of the actual game"
145,it's frustrating when you put it like that .
146,"that is where they make all the money , the ads and constant commercials"
147,the nfl uses tracking chips on their players as well .
148,do you know why ?
149,jerry jones plays football .
150,he actually own the dallas cowboys . apparently he has been pushing for an 18 game season .
151,"yeah , i thought he was a player , but he is the owner . i like the commercial with the two football players who make cupcakes ."
152,ha ha . troy aikman disagrees with expanding the season by two games on account of the players health and he has many supporters with the recent research regarding brain health . i agree with troy .
153,does mean sickness or injuries ?
154,injuries leading to brain damage over time . jones has countered by saying they could shorten the preseason by two games to even it out and it would be even safer . but i disagree with that because teams are more careful with their players in preseason for fear of them being injured for the actual season when it counts .
155,"i don't know . cte is dangerous , but they can't diagnosis it officially until someone is dead due to the way the test is performed on the brain ,"
156,true but they seem to be finding at least some degree of it in the majority of autopsies they have performed . jones also cited more money as a reason to extend the season which i believe is his only real motivation . i find that upsetting when he has to have more money than he could possibly spend at this point . it's very greedy .
157,it's greedy and dangerous
158,that's true . it seems to damage their impulse control . he says the players would make more but there is no guarantee of that and i don't think it's worth their health . they are already making a staggering amount of money .
159,i think it won't pass . nfl is a big corporation .
160,i don't think it will either . did you know that the average football game only has 11 minutes of actual live game play ! i knew that they felt way too full of commercials and interruptions .
161,"yes , the commercials make a lot of money ."
162,"yes , that is a prime advertising time . i do not like the way they treat their cheerleaders . saints cheerleaders aren't even allowed to eat in the same restaurant as players and if a player enters and they are already eating , they have to stop eating and leave ."
163,that's probably due to sexual harassment . there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free .
164,not sure because i also recently found out that the cheerleaders make nearly minimum wage which is ridiculous . that's interesting . i know those were the height of entertainment at one point but i wonder if they hold up now .
165,radios are interesting . jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio .
166,that's pretty fascinating especially given the distance .
167,"yeah , i wonder if aliens listen to music ."
168,i know we have sent music into space just in case .
169,i didn't know that . hopefully soothing music .
170,it's been a while since i heard the list but i know there is some classical in there .
171,do you like the nfl ?
172,yes i do . did you know that women can play in it as well ?
173,yes there is no rule in place that says that they cannot play
174,yes and if they qualify they are good to go and play
175,yes . the gameplay is averaged at 11 minutes anyways
176,yes and yet we are glued to the tv for hours to an end
177,true . did you know engineers make more than footballers over the lifetime ?
178,yes but they also have longer careers so that helps i think
179,yes true . did you hear of that rule for the saints cheerleaders ?
180,yes they are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players
181,yes and they have to leave mid meal also if they walk in
182,yes it is so sexist and it really needs to go
183,i agree . do you watch much tv ?
184,a lot actually . i like to watch the simpsons and you ?
185,nice me too . there is an episode where bart does not appear
186,yes and he is not even mentioned in it
187,yeah . how about that 70s show ?
188,yes i like it but in the uk it really flopped
189,yes after just 10 episodes because they remade it verbatim
190,yeah their bad and mistake . nice chat
191,same here and have a good one
192,"hi , do you like nfl ?"
193,"yes , i watch a little . what about you ?"
194,i am big fan of nfl . the 32 teams are great .
195,do you have a favorite nfl team ?
196,"yes , the team was new england patriots . what is your favorite team ?"
197,"that's cool , the new england patriots are my favorite team , as well !"
198,that's great . and they win the 6 nfl championships .
199,"yes , they are great . did you watch them play in the superbowl in february ?"
200,"yes , i did . it was great ."
201,"yes , it was , but it seemed like it took three hours to play . especially , when you consider theaverage nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay ."
202,"an average professional football game lasts 3 hours and 12 minutes , but if you tally up the time when the ball is actually in play , the action amounts to a more 11 minutes . ppart of the discrepancy has to do with the basic rules of american football ."
203,i feel there is alot of wasted time .
204,"maybe , it was waste of time . the nep owner was robert kraft ."
205,"yes , he's the owner . on a different subject , do you watch television ?"
206,"yeah , i watch television . because i love watch movies , comedy shoes , and sports ."
207,"me too ! have you ever watched , ' the simpsons ' ?"
208,i like the simpsons . it was released in 1989 .
209,did you see the episode where bart is neither seen or mentioned ?
210,i watch all 30 seasons . what about you ?
211,"oh , wow , you are a big fan ! i never remember seeing this episode , though ."
212,i also can't remember that series . but i was great .
213,"yes , it was a great show ! well , it has been nice chatting with you this morning . i hope you enjoy the rest of your day ."
214,"yes , i really happy to chat with you ."
215,have a good day !
216,good morning ! do you like football ?
217,"hello there , i do enjoy football , both american and international , how about you ?"
218,i do ! i'm learning a lot of jerry jones ! have you heard of him ?
219,"oh yeah the cowboys owner , i thought they would have made a longer run in this years playoffs , are you a cowboys fan ?"
220,i am ! he is trying to expand to 18 games instead of the 16 they have now .
221,"yeah i could agree , if they took two of the preseason games away ."
222,i agree ! who wants to deal with a unexpected brain injury ?
223,exactly ! did you ever see the concussion movie with will smith ?
224,i haven't ! is it good ? did you watch it on tv ?
225,"yeah i thought it was really good , and it really makes you concerned about all of the brain damage football players of all ages take during the game ."
226,i will have to look that up . i wonder how that would affect female players in the nfl ? there is no written rule against them .
227,"i think i read about that , i think it would be so cool if a female player did make a roster and made an impact in the league ."
228,"one has been drafted ! with only 11 minutes of actual play , maybe the chances are low of her getting one ."
229,"that is very true , i don't think most people realize just how little actual gameplay there is in games ."
230,the nfl tracking chips that are in the players uniforms have been quite handy for finding info like that out !
231,"yeah they sure have , i hope they are using that technology to help with player safety as well ."
232,me too ! have you ever watched the 70's show ?
233,"yeah i sure have , i grew up in wisconsin and had a very similar teen life lol . how about you ?"
234,i just loved watching it ! was a lot of fun ! but did you know they tried to remake it in the uk and it bombed ?
235,yeah i heard they did it verbatim and it was really bad !
236,"i guess the uk could just not relate ! i watch the simpsons , but have you seen f is for family ?"
237,"i love the simpsons , but wish they would have stopped making the show after season 12 or so ."
238,kinda getting old isn't it ? too bad ! kinda like pokemon for me ! my kids loved that show !
239,"that is incredible how many shows they made . it was nice talking with you , i hope you have a good day !"
240,hi there ! do you have a football team that you like ?
241,"not really . i'm not into sports that much , but it's an interesting subject to me . do you have a favorite team ?"
242,i do . i love football facts . i know former nfl'er benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled a football in his nfl career .
243,"i guess recently discoveries have been made linking football to traumatic brain injury , obviously , but even worse , also degenerative brain disease and chronic encephalopathy ! i'll be looking more into it , as i said , i'm interested : ,"
244,i believe it . it is a rough sport .
245,"absolutely ! running back larry johnson is battling self destructive impulses and surely cte . it seems unfair to me , to have a sport in which the players are suffering for the rest of their lives !"
246,wow . i had no idea of such issus . hard to believe the nfl has no rules against females playing in the league as long as they can meet eligibility requirements .
247,"shake my head ! and i was just reading about it and found out that in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ! we should all just go back to bowling ! it's much safer : ,"
248,far safer indeed ! amazing that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live game play .
249,"yeah that is amazing ! i would think the average game play would be much longer . hm . i wonder why ! so , it's hard to believe women could play too , but they might not be as offended if they were playing against the university of iowa who painted the visiting teams locker room pink ! ha ! talk about good sportsmanship : ,"
250,no kidding ! did you know the nfl uses tracking chips to track player movement ?
251,no i didn't ! i hope they put the chips in say the shoes or helmets versus implanting them in the players bodies ! the very idea of tracking chips scares me !
252,they put the chips in the players shoulder pads so they can track every move the player makes on the field .
253,"oh whew ! okay . that isn't sooo bad : , i wonder why the new orleans saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat at the same restaurant as any nfl player ! i heard that if the cheerleader is eating at a restaurant and any player comes in , she has to leave ! that's absurd !"
254,"sounds sexist if you ask me . an engineer's average lifetime salary is higher than that of an nfl player . not as exciting , but interesting ."
255,"something tells me that being an engineer is much safer than being an nfl player . hard to say which job would be more satisfying or more worthy of doing . considering engineers get paid more , i'd go with that job !"
256,i would agree . it is notable though that it is only a 17 week regular playing season for nfl teams .
257,"oh wow ! if that is per year , i'd love to only work 4 months and 1 week a year . but i'm sure they have to practice and do other things , like media events throughout the year . so maybe i will look into being an engineer and put my football dreams behind me . haha . kidding of course : ,"
258,i would too . it was really nice chatting with you today !
259,thanks ! same to you ! i hope you have a wonderful day !
260,goodbye !
261,goodbye !
262,"hey , there , fellow chatter ! how are you doing ?"
263,good thanks . how are you ? do you like football ?
264,"i enjoy the sport called football , but i do not watch it much . you ?"
265,i don't watch it a lot either . i dont really understand it though espn's superimposed line does help a lot . they won an emmy for it .
266,"must have been a weak field of competition that year . next year , they change the color , and win another award ."
267,haha . it's amazing how much popularity football has gained . in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars
268,"bowlers had the ideal physique in the day , is my guess . people wanted to look like them , in their polyester pants and multicolored shoes ."
269,"oh , yes ! well , maybe if i was around for the football game where a team lost 0222 , i would be interested in football ."
270,could you make money on the game though ? and was there just 11 minutes of action in that game ?
271,haha there would have had to be more right ? !
272,the cumberland players would have made more money as engineers .
273,i find it interesting that average earnings of engineers is higher than average of fooball players
274,plus there are fewer concussions in engineering . probably engineers have better helmets . no cheerleaders though .
275,"yeah , too bad there is no respect for the cheerleaders in nfl . saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant even if they are already eating , if players want to eat there ."
276,i guess the cheerleaders have to wear tracking chips so that the team knows what restaurant they're in .
277,"haha , yeah i find it cool how technology has advanced so much in the nfl but i certainly hope tracking isn't necessary off the field ."
278,"that would be terrible for the players , but perhaps quite entertaining for fans . speaking of entertainment , did you ever play the nes ?"
279,i used to ! it only had 54 colors !
280,"and plenty of games . it got retired in 2003 , well before it's time . it should have been here for another century ."
281,"haha , true but i would have though it retired way before then !"
282,"too many people loved that little system . anyway , i enjoyed the chat !"
283,yeah i did too !
284,"hi there , hope you are having a good afternoon . when you hear the word football , do you think of american or canadian football or rugby ?"
285,"i actually think of soccer lol ,"
286,"well , so do a lot of people around the world ! it's funny that the top bowlers in 1960 made more than the top nfl players . i'm sure that's not true anymore for american football or soccer !"
287,"i dont think its true anymore , pro football and soccer players make a ton of money , bowling was a popular sport back then , not as much today"
288,"ye , the games have changed over the years . like when espn started superimposing the yellow first down line over the field . they won an emmy for that , which is also amazing !"
289,i guessed the creation of the line is of great contribution to the game not only back then but it changed the game forever
290,"it made history for sure . speaking of history , i've seen a few georgia tech games when i lived close by but wow , their score of 2220 made the history books as the highest ever score !"
291,"that is a humiliating defeat , i wonder if the other team was blind"
292,can't really imagine how that happened ! what else do you enjoy for entertainment ? did you play nintendo back in the day ?
293,"i did , i liked it , it was primitive only 54 colors right ?"
294,"yes , hard to imagine back then , what game systems would become . japan continued to sell them until 2003 but then they finally stopped ."
295,"i guess nobody was buying them anymore , still a great system , i used to play the mario games in that console and then nintendo 64"
296,my kids also loved bill ney the science guy too ! i never thought he looked like steve martin but apparently he won a lookalike contest !
297,"they look like twin brotheres lol , that show was really fun , i liked it , was informative and interesting"
298,"ronald regan was another tv and movie star , and he even played a football player too . funny that he lost a part because he did look presidential !"
299,"that is funny ! they had it all wrong then ,"
300,another thing i think is wrong is that the new orlean's football team makes their cheerleaders leave a resturant if a player comes in . i get that they don't want them to socialize but that seems wrong on several levels .
301,"i heard about that rule and it makes me so angry , that is really unfair to cheerleaders having to leave in the midle of your meal just because a player comes in , makes me really angry"
302,i guess they would be better off being an engineer than cheerleaders anyway . engineers have a much higher lifetime earning than nfl players do !
303,"maybe thats because they tend to have longer carreers but i agree , football also causes brain damage and unwanted injuries"
304,"right and who wants that . i guess the cheerleaders could also go out for the team , since there is no ban of female players ! then they wouldn't have to leave and they wouldn't get head injuries very often either !"
305,"i guess they could also play , they can switch roles and it will be the other way around"
306,hi how are you ? do you like sports ?
307,"hi there , i'm good thank you . i love sports ! how about you ?"
308,i like basketball and football . sometimes i get a chance to watch .
309,"i used to be really into basketball when i was growing up , i still watch my favorite team though . do you know what the highest grossing basketball movie ever was ?"
310,i enjoyed playing when i was younger . i try to watch the finals . the highest grossing ? what ?
311,the top grossing basketball movie ever ? it was space jam . did you hear there is another space jam in the works ?
312,another one ? with lebron ? i guess that makes sense . the producers probably waited until another superstar appeared .
313,"yeah i think so , i think lebron will be the star of the movie ."
314,"yeah , he just makes so much money . endorsements , salary . it is amazing ."
315,"he sure does , i wonder if he is among the top grossing athletes around the world ?"
316,he makes so much money . i wonder when he'll retire . he is about 34 years old .
317,"he is , and i don't think he will for another few years yet . do you follow the nfl at all ?"
318,"i try to watch the super bowl , and maybe the playoffs ."
319,"yeah i always watch the super bowl , i mostly follow my team . the playoffs are always exciting as well ."
320,i usually root for the underdog in the superbowl . i like to seem the long shot do well .
321,"i think i usually do the same . did you there is a high school football stadium in texas that seats 18 , 000 ?"
322,in texas ? im not surprised . football is a religion in texas .
323,"yeah they love football down there , especially high school football , i think they take it very seriously ."
324,"yeah , the fans probably wanted a bigger stadium too . anyway , great chat !"
325,"i guess it cost 60 million to make , wow . yeah same to you it was fun chatting ."
326,have a good night !
327,"thank you , i hope you do too !"
328,do you watch the nfl ?
329,"i am a big fan of the nfl , how about you ?"
330,"i am , but i don't like that there is only 11 minutes of gameplay ."
331,it is sort of frustrating that there is so little actual gameplay . sometimes it does not feel that way though .
332,"yeah , did you know that an engineer on average makes more than an nfl player ?"
333,i know a lot of players have short careers so they don't make as much as the elite players in the league .
334,interesting . did you know that iowa's locker rooms are painted pink for the visiting team ?
335,i did not know that . i wonder if they think that will throw off the visiting team's performance ?
336,i think it does
337,i don't see that playing a factor with teams these days . i would like to hear an opposing school talk about it
338,"yeah . well , you are probably better off being an engineer than an nfl player ."
339,i would imagine that being an engineer comes with a lot less health risks such as brain damage !
340,that is for sure ! did you know that in the 60s bowlers made more than football players ?
341,"i know some of the philadelphia eagles had to have offseason jobs in the 60s . that's how chuck bednarik earned the nickname ' concrete charlie ' , he sold concrete when the season was over ."
342,"that's crazy , but i can believe it . maybe they should have been bowlers ?"
343,i would be curious to know why bowlers were being paid so well then .
344,i suppose there were a lot of fans for bowlers . in 39 out of 50 states the highest paid state employee is a football or basketball coach .
345,i think it's pretty crazy that some of these coaches get paid so much . the schools could use that for better purposes .
346,"yeah , it must be a huge suck on the resources for students education ."
347,"i know they bring a lot of revenue in for schools and you want the best candidates for the job , but other professors must feel real cheated by those salaries ."
348,"i hear yah , but i bet if they are tenured they get paid pretty well ."
349,are you a football fan ?
350,yea i watch the nfl and a little college . i'm glad to see danny johnson made it onto the redskins despite playing at southern university
351,yes ! did you know that the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink ?
352,"yea , i guess iowa was trying to psych out the visiting teams by painting the lockers pink"
353,no doubt . lol in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars of the day . times have sure changed since then .
354,"yea , espn won an emmy for it's coverage of the nfl , it's never won an emmy for its bowling coverage"
355,lol i love that superimposed line they created .
356,"yea , it's too bad there was not tv when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 , i'd love to see highlights of that"
357,talk about a blowout !
358,"yea , i wonder how much live gameplay that game had since the nfl averages 11 minutes"
359,lol did you know that the nfl has no written rule that prevents females from playing ? maybe we'll see one someday . maybe a kicker ?
360,"possibly , i wonder if a female player was on the saints if she would not be allowed to be in the same public places as the male players like the cheerleaders are"
361,isn't that an odd rule to have ? i don't get it .
362,"yea , the saints rules sounds really outdated and sexist"
363,"i agree . what do you think of the tracking chips they are putting in the players shoulder pads and footballs ? they claim it's to track the players moves on the field and to track the velocity , etc . of the balls ."
364,"it's pretty interesting , i know in baseball people are making a big deal out of tracking ball speed and velocity"
365,it's crazy . i'm wondering with the chips in football could they be programmed so that say the chip in the ball is programmed to go to the the chip in the shoulder pad ? seems kind of shady . . .
366,"i guess so but it might be cool if they put chips in basketball , i'd love to know how much force kareem abduljabbar's dunk had"
367,i remember him ! he was famous for his hook shot and in college he dunked so much that they banned it for almost a decade ! it's been fun chatting with you !
368,"yea , i wonder i jabbar ever coached , they are the highest paid employees in 39 of 50 states"
369,crazy that those college coaches are paid that much ! have a good one !
370,good morning ! do you like football ?
371,hey there . yes i love football . i am sad that the nfl season is over .
372,i am too . a 17 week regular season is just too short .
373,yeah i agree especially with only 11 minutes of average gameplay per game .
374,"they definitely should make that longer . say , i've heard that women can play if they want to and meet the requirements . do you think they should ?"
375,i think they should if they are good enough but they shouldn't if they are smart . it is such a brutal game . and they don't make all that much because of injuries .
376,"yeah , the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than that of an nfl player and a mlb player ."
377,did you hear how the saints cheerleaders can't interact with the players ?
378,i think i have . isn't that where if a cheerleader is in a restaurant and a player comes in she has to leave ?
379,yeah exactly . the nfl even tracks player movements using tracking chips !
380,you mean on the field right ?
381,yes on the field ! they put it in their shoulder pads and also the football itself !
382,wow ! i knew a little about the football but i had no idea they had chips on the players too .
383,yeah no wonder they can get such good accurate stats !
384,you know you're right ! it does make sense when you think about it . i wonder if they'll ever use those chips like nascar does their cars and be able to tell if players make touchdowns and first downs .
385,good question . i also really like the yellow first down marker when watching games on tv . espn won an emmy for that .
386,i like that too . it makes the game more intense and exciting when you see how far a team has to go to make the first down .
387,agreed . i wonder if the nba uses chips to track stats too ? there is even a bball court on top of the usa supreme court building .
388,"hmm , i never thought about that . if they don't , they should . that bball court you're talking about by the way is called the highest court in the land ."
389,oh very cool . wonder if anyone famous has played there ? kareem abul jabbar used to have such a dominant dunk that it got banned in college !
390,it got banned ? he must have been overpowering teams and winning all the time !
391,hello !
392,"hello , do you have good knowledge about football players ?"
393,i am not a huge fan of football but i like basketball . . . .
394,same ! i like basketball . i am a big fan of the golden state warriors . how about you ?
395,"cool , i am a big fan of phoenix suns . . . my team !"
396,nice ! have you been to a game ?
397,"yes , not too many but a few . how about you ?"
398,a few as well . i always go to the stadium early to receive bobbleheads of the basketball players .
399,"that's awesome , i have a couple of those too but bought them from a friend ."
400,"awww man , i hope they are worth the price . reading from the factual section 3 , i agree that space jam is the highestgrossing basketball movie . have you watched it ?"
401,i think i have but it has been a long time lol . . . . i too think it is interesting that the us supreme court building has a basketball court on the top floor how cool is that !
402,that is cool . i guess they need some exercise after a hard day's work .
403,true ! basketball is definitely good exercise lol
404,do you play ?
405,"i did back in school but not anymore . i play softball on a league though and its pretty fun , how about you do you play any sports ?"
406,"it's been a while since i played a sport . i used to play basketball , but now it's all about tennis and badminton . of course in this kind of weather is a no no ."
407,"yea , i live in a warm climate so we play sports more in cooler weather when its 70s and 80s outside ."
408,"for sure , i bet . i am waiting until the sun comes up ."
409,have you ever played football at all or ever had a team you like in the nfl ?
410,"well , in middle school , but not a fan . i only like the 49ers . it is because of my relatives ."
411,"oh , yeah . . . i only watch sometimes because of friends lol"
412,it was nice talking to you . happy new year .
413,happy new year ! ! ! bye !
414,how is it going ? do you like football ?
415,"hello ! i am . i prefer college , but i am pumped for the playoffs this weekend !"
416,awesome ! i don't keep up with football much . who is in the playoffs ?
417,"'there are four teams from the national and american football conferences . the nfc has la rams , cowboys , eagles , and saints . the afc has kc , la chargers , ne , and indianapolis ."
418,"oh ok , i only know some of those . its kinda crazy to think the nfl actual gameplay is only like 11 min when it usually last about 34 hours !"
419,"that is crazy ! to think they spend all that money , going as far as tracking almost every move of a player through specially designed chips for such a relative short time of actual game play ."
420,"i heard about that too , technology has improved so many things , like also when you are watching football they can draw on the screens and show different plays and when the line is they highlight it . they also have amazing playback or forward replays !"
421,great point . how many of us are indebted to madden for breaking down football like that ?
422,"probably millions lol football has some weird customs , what is with a team painting the opposing teams locker room pink ?"
423,"ah , i know that team all too well . that's iowa who is my team's rival as we are neighboring states ."
424,oh i see . do you know what the tactic or custom is ? why do they paint it pink ?
425,"i am pretty sure it was hayden fry , who the old tv show ' coach ' was loosely based on , . i think it was that the pink would demotivate the opposition or make them lose their edge ."
426,"ah i see , maybe to soften them up i guess . that's pretty smart , unless they knew about it already . did you know there is a football player that never fumbled in his whole career ? why isn ; t this guy more sought out after lol that sounds incredible ."
427,"wow . maybe he just isn't as explosive as others , but it's pretty impressive ."
428,i know right ! i believe he played for the patriots .
429,"do you like any other sports , like basketball ?"
430,"kinda the same , i do not follow it much . i watch the warrios sometimes though , how about you ?"
431,"i watch a little . i will admit that the warriors are not my favorite team . i guess it's because they are so good , but i have to remember that they really built that team from scratch and then added amazing players around what they drafted ."
432,"yeah , true . i find it funny that the inventor of basketball is the only losing couch in kansas university history lol"
433,"i wonder how much he got paid for that ? in the vast majority of states today , the college basketball or football coach is the highest paid employee of the state ."
434,"hmmm good question . i hope he gets some sort of royalties lol this sport has blown up , it is so popular and generates so much money ! anyways its been good talking to you !"
435,i love the nfl i cant wait for the season to start back up ! 17 weeks is not enough ! do you like football ?
436,i have a passing knowledge
437,thats great ! do you watch football or just keep up with it in general ?
438,mainly watching it time to time
439,cool ! i really like how hightech they are getting adding micro chips into players pads and the football or . it makes the game fun !
440,they sure get a lot of data . i wonder what they use it for
441,ive heard football speed when through and other stuff . funny that the biggest thing for them was the addition of the yellow first down line . won them an emmy !
442,that was by espn right ?
443,yeah ! really cool that something so simple had such a huge impact ! nothing like in hockey when they highlighted the puck .
444,"i mean considering there is only a dozen or so minutes of real gameplay , any help understanding what is going on is a huge plus"
445,true ! they dont even play that much ! if they are only playing for 11 minutes they figure out a way to make games more fun . you know . . make a game with some huge scores like 200 or something .
446,the winner were just that good and the losers just that bad i guess
447,i bet youre right . you really need a poor team to go nothing against a team that scores 222 . i dont even know who cumberland is . .
448,i mean the winners must have had talent like tom brady or green ellis
449,i always that greenellis was great . he was amazing and i think never fumbled the ball . ever !
450,indeed . that is an impressive feat
451,yeah it is ! i dont think he even got paid that well . nothing like leveon bell and his 13 million a year
452,well at least these players are much better paid now than in the 1960s when even bowlers made more
453,ain't that the truth ! for how physical the game is they should be getting paid a lot .
454,it is a dangerous contact sport after all . it is probably due to forced early retirement that the average football player's lifetime earnings is less than that of engineers
455,yes it is . have a great day !
456,to you as well .
457,are you a fan of the nfl ?
458,nfl ? the national football league ? i dont really know it well . you ?
459,"yea that is , do you know any of the 32 teams ?"
460,"yeah , i guess i have heard some names . the patriots is one that i hear a lot"
461,"yea they keep winning super bowls and have the greatest quarterback of all time , tom brady . you don't watch much nfl , do you watch college football much ?"
462,"no , i dont . i guess the game is more fun at the college level . the kids probably enjoy playing the game ."
463,"yea , my favorite team is iowa , they paint their visiting locker room pink"
464,"i wonder if that has any effect all . if so , i would expect everyone to do it ."
465,"i wonder also , i would have to check their home record to see a trend . are you a basketball fan since you don't watch much football ?"
466,"i like basketball , but i usually watch around the playoffs . i like golden state . you ?"
467,"me too , i like the bulls , but golden state is fun to watch . do you know who james naismith was ?"
468,he was the guy who invented the sport . he was canadian i believe .
469,"he was the worst coach in kansas history , you think he could have rigged the game in his favor"
470,he might have had bad players too . maybe he just didnt get the strategy . oh well . i think he has an award named after him .
471,"for sure , i heard that also . do you ever catch anything on espn ?"
472,"no , though it guess it is insanely popular . sports all the time would be a big hit in the us ."
473,they won an espy for their yellow line on tv
474,an espy ? i dont know that award . the yellow line ?
475,"sorry they won an emmy , lol ! that is a big thing for something so small"
476,"oh , an emmy . yeah , the tv award . a yellow line ? hm . a weak year for awards . anyway , great chat !"
477,"you too , it was so nice chatting with you !"
478,"hello , do you like football ?"
479,"i do like football sometimes , not all the time , but sometimes . you ?"
480,"i watch a few games a year , but i do not keep up with it at all ."
481,"i try to watch the playoffs , maybe the superbowl ."
482,thats cool . did you know the nfl has no written rule against female players ?
483,"i have heard that , but i don't think that women can qualitfy . it's a tough game"
484,"yeah , just depends on the woman . i hear the nfl uses tracking chips on the players and football ."
485,"i would like to see a woman that could do that . i have no problem with that . if she can play , let her in . put the tracking chips on her ."
486,the average game play of a football game is 11 min ! it takes like 3 hours usually to see the whole event lol
487,"those players spend a lot of time standing around and waiting . i figured that 11 minutes was a bit short , but now that i think about it , it sounds right ."
488,"lol yeah i know right ! so many time outs , fouls , huddles , etc ."
489,"yes , basketball is a sport that flows a lot more ."
490,"i agree , a lot of consistant action ."
491,basketball was invented by a canadian . a canadian
492,lol cool . i hear the inventor of basketball is the only losing coach in the university of kansas history . ironic .
493,"he really could not coach . i guess he knew how to create game , not play them ."
494,"yeah , thats unfortunate . i hope he gets royalties or something , this game has blown up ! it generates so much money !"
495,"yes , it has . the college coaches make so much . it seems like a distortion of the purpose of college ."
496,yeah 39 out of 50 states the highest paid employee is the college basketball or football coach .
497,"i wonder where this all going to lead . soon the degreegranting aspect of college will become optional extra . anyway , great chat !"
498,great speaking with you .
499,hi do you follow football ?
500,"i am a fan yeah , do you have a favorite team ? 32 teams 2 division 1 winner"
501,my favorite team is the buffalo bills . lol the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink . i think the bills might have stepped in there once . lol
502,how did they do past season ? and that is funny lol a pink locker room for the visiting team
503,the bills didn't do well . they rarely do well . haven't been good since the jim kelly days . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars did back then . that's sure changed now .
504,"twice as much woah , that is impressive , thats a lot of money , things have changed a lot for players over the years"
505,yes ! former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the ball in his nfl career . impressive !
506,"that is impressive , did you hear about coach matt patricia ?"
507,i haven't heard of him . what did he do ?
508,"he is a rocket scientist and also a coach , he must be a really smart man ."
509,i bet ! i'll have to look him up . espn won an emmy for creating the yellow superimposed first down line on tv .
510,"i guess the yellow line is a big contribution to the game , also the tracking chips , those seem great also ."
511,yes i agree ! the nfl has no written rule against female players . wonder if any have ever tried out ?
512,there's no written rule against female players really ? i guess we wont see them play in the league as its a physical game
513,i know . maybe as a kicker maybe . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
514,"only 11 minutes ? that seems really unfair , so since the re introduction of the nfl in 1999 the qb with most wins is ben roethlisberger"
515,that must be in the cleveland browns stadium ?
516,"i think he played for the steelers , he must be a hall of famer ."
517,he is their current qb . the highest score ever for a football game was when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 . it's been fun chatting !
518,"oh i see , didnt know he still played and that is a humiliating loss , hope you have a nice day , its been fun chatting bye ."
519,have a good day !
520,"hi , how are you ?"
521,"i am well , how are you ?"
522,i am well . do you know anything about virginia football ?
523,i know that virginia football has been trying to fix it's program with a new athletic director . they have not been doing well in past seasons .
524,they have not . their basketball program has been better under tony bennett .
525,is tony bennett new to the basketball program ?
526,"no , he's been there for a few years . got them up to a top 5 rank . slow and boring to watch though ."
527,i am hoping that the football team will do better this year . they only won 6 games this year .
528,yeah . i think they should be better . theyve got a good recruiting base there .
529,they're trying to get the recruitment even better . they are also adding a football operations center to draw even more attention .
530,nice . clemson just added something like that and it has a recording studio in there for their players !
531,that reminds me that the supreme court building has a basketball court on the top floor .
532,that's a strange place for it . i wonder how often the notorious rbg plays . . .
533,she will get dunking banned like kareem abduljabbar
534,i often get those two confused . . . the highest paid coach in many states is their basketball or football coach .
535,an amusing contrast to the fact that the players are not paid anything
536,yeah . really sad for them . i don't feel like free education is enough for many of these players .
537,through free schooling in exchange for about 11 minutes of gameplay seems like a good deal .
538,"when put like that , yes that seems like a great deal !"
539,hopefully the whole department can work together and improve things for both he players and the staff
540,yeah . nice chatting with you !
541,did you know steve spurrier coach the redskins ?
542,lol . . . yeah ! i still remember that scene where he did duck lips and the tv station slowed it down .
543,"i know , its hard to find characters as known and famous as steve lol , he sure is a strange thing ."
544,yeah . . . a heisman trophy winner and also coached at florida state .
545,in what year did he win the heisman trophy ? thats new to me .
546,it was 1966 at university of florida
547,"oh i see , it was a long time ago , i heard he also led a team called the tampa bay bandits ."
548,"yeah , he's been around quite a bit . that's just crazy though that the reskins don't even have him listed on their web site when listing past coaches ."
549,"they dont ? i wonder if thats because of an internal problem , he was one of the highest paid coaches in nfl while on the team"
550,"i am sure because they are embarrassed . . . but come on , you hired him !"
551,"he has 12 victories in 32 games so maybe thats why he got fired , i think the team had high hopes on him ."
552,i am sure they did . . . that's just disrespectful and childish . . . there are a lot worst coaches out there !
553,"there sure are , speaking of lack of respect the lockers for the visiting team of the university of iowa are painted all pink"
554,"omg . . . that's just mean ! ! ! how about the disrespect the new orleans saints cheerleaders get . when a player come into a restaurant , even if the cheerleader was there before the player the cheerleader has to leave !"
555,"that is really rude and sexist , i mean why do they have to leave if they dont want players mixing with cheerleader why dont make it both ways ."
556,exactly ! ! ! it's the nfl playing god ! ! ! geez ! ! !
557,"i get you , so heres a cool fact you know benjarvus green ellis ? he used to be an rb in the patriots and he never fumbled a ball ."
558,"wow . . . that does not surprise me with the patriots luck : ,"
559,what are your thought on the superbowl on sunday ?
560,i hope the patriots lose ! lol
561,lol thats mean i am a patriots fan but its ok if they lose im not a bigtime fan either .
562,do you watch much football ?
563,"i do like to watch it , what about you ?"
564,"i love watching both college and nfl , do you have a favorite team ?"
565,"i do have a favorite , the new england patriots , what about you ?"
566,nice ! i like the vikings . were you a benjarvus green ellis fan ?
567,"no , who is benjarvus green ellis ? im not sure i remember that player"
568,"he was the rb years ago , he never fumbled the ball once in his career !"
569,never fumbled the ball ? whoa that is really impressive not many players can say that maybe he is the only one .
570,"right , they fumble all the time now . have you heard of the university of iowa ?"
571,"yeah i have heard of it , they have a nice football team ."
572,"they are good , they are my hometown team and alma mater ! they paint their locker rooms pink for the opponents"
573,"they do ? i think that is a really funny strategy i wonder if it works , it must confuse some teams ."
574,that is what i am thinking . they do play good at home for sure ! do you watch much basketball ?
575,"i like basketball yeah , mainly any sport out there , i love sports ."
576,"me too , sports are so awesome . did you hear who the most losingest coach is at kansas ?"
577,was that coach the same person that invented the game ? coach james naismith ?
578,"yea , crazy , you think he would have rigged it in his favor to win some more games !"
579,"i know right , if you invent the game then you can also bent the rules a bit , did you know about the court in the top of the supreme court ?"
580,no way ! i can just picture ginsberg throwing down a 360 dunk in it
581,"its called the highest court on land , cool name and yeah that would be funny lol"
582,"nice , that is a cool place , i wonder if it actually gets used . it was so nice chatting with you , enjoy your day !"
583,hey did you know in the 60's the top bowlers made 2x as much as teh top football players ?
584,"hello there , no wow i didn't know that . that is pretty crazy to think how much has changed since then ."
585,"ya i don't even know how much bowlers make now , probably only the top ones make decent money now"
586,yeah i would say you are right . did you know that a high school football stadium in texas cost 60 million to build ?
587,"no thats crazy , espeically for high school which is not serious and i'd imagine doesn't generate close to that much revenue , i wonder why they spent so much"
588,"yeah that is a crazy amount of money for high school football . i guess it seats 18 , 000 ! !"
589,"ooof , i don't know i don't personally like football that much do you ? this says the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay which doesn't surprise me haha"
590,holy cow that is very little . i guess you don't notice so much while watching it on tv .
591,"no but it makes sense , there's lots of them positioning and replays and referees calling stuff , like the actual action is only 11 minutes that's very wild to me but it makes sense"
592,yeah it does when you think about it . do you know what year was the first nfl playoff game ?
593,i don't was it in the early 1900's ?
594,yeah it was in 1932 on an 80 yard dirt field in chicago . i bet that was pretty rough being tackled on .
595,"oooof ya that sounds like it would hurt , i saw on youtube the first team to have helmets with symbols on them were the rams , one teammate just painted the circular horns on his helmet one day"
596,"that is awesome , old football stories are pretty interesting . are you a basketball fan as well ?"
597,"not so much but i do watch games from time to time . i'm more of a tennis fan , i like that there is no team and it is 100 percent on one person to win or lose"
598,"yeah i like them both , i am a sports fan in general . i always said i would get into hockey if i had a local team to cheer for ."
599,"oh what area do you live in ? i'm in detroit so most people are red wings fans , but i like pittsburgh cuz thats where a lot of my family is from"
600,i am from wisconsin and we don't have a team in this state .
601,"ah that is true , ya you'd think being so far north that they would obviously have a team , and being close to canada haha"
602,yeah that is true . at least we have a pro nfl team .
603,"what i didn't know is the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl playr or mlb player , on average"
604,"wow i would never have guessed that , maybe because they are working more years . it was nice talking with you today ."
605,hi how are you today ?
606,"i'm great , it's really inspiring to hear about how steve spurrier played so hard in his day and earned the reputation to garner the highest paying coaching position in history ."
607,"yeah , and did you know that he actually coached the redskins for two seasons ?"
608,"yes that's exactly the position i am referring to , they paid him almost 25 million for a five year contract . i wonder why he only coached two seasons ."
609,"yeah really , haha . in the 1960's top bowlers made as mauch as top football stars"
610,"wow , i could have done that since bowling is a lot easier than football ! but apparently nfl players really don't make as much as other careers , like engineers ."
611,really ? should have been an engineer .
612,"yes seriously but some of us lack math skills . it sounds like it's tough working in athletics , can you belief new orleans saints cheerleaders aren't even allowed to eat at the same restaurant as an nfl player ?"
613,i can't believe that . i wonder why ? how about the highest score ever in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 .
614,they are southern so maybe they just have a very prim and proper reputation to protect . that was crazy . it makes me wonder if they rigged it ! it reminds me of great gatsby talking about the world series being rigged around the same year .
615,yeah ! i was suprized to read that a former rb patriots benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball in his entire football career . that's amazing !
616,"yeah seriously , we've come a long way since then considering that we now can track players with chips to know everything about their speed , velocity , rotation and more ."
617,true . did you know the university of iowa painted the visiting team's locker room pick . they got a pretty good sense of humor .
618,oh i hope they were good sports about it .
619,"i totally meant pink . glad you got that . yeah , i'm sure they were ."
620,wow i didn't even read it as anything but pink haha . i could imagine football can get pretty aggressive and competitive when so much income is involved .
621,oh yeah ! it's pretty cool that there are so many variations of football . they are known as football codes .
622,"i can never get in to football , you only ever get to see like eleven minutes of actual live gameplay per game !"
623,that's true . the rest is comercials . although i do love the new superbowl commercials . those are fun .
624,i also enjoy watching the superbowl commercials . i wonder if watching superbowl commercials was always so possible even back in the early days in the 70s
625,i wonder too . i'll have to look it up . i just found out that espn created the yellow line represtenting the first down line for football .
626,i always saw that on tv but never before thought about where that came from . did you hear they won an award for that ?
627,"yeah , they won an emmy . pretty awesome . i wonder who came up with it ? it had to start with one person ."
628,probably some network graphic designer guy or team i guess .
629,"happy holidays , nice talking to you ."
630,do you like football ?
631,"i'm a fan of all sports , but football happens to be one of my favorites and i follow the nfl closely . you ?"
632,i don't really watch it that much . i did watch the super bowl which is the first sunday in february .
633,"oh , did you hear anything about what's been going with le'veon bell this past season ?"
634,i heard he is back in pittsburgh .
635,"he held out this year , hoping to get a big contract from pittsburgh or become a free agent next year . you wouldn't believe how much he money he cost himself ."
636,"855 , 000 a week . is that really true ? wow !"
637,"yeah that's years and years of salary for me lol . he will likely get a huge contract this summer , he's one of the best running backs in football ."
638,"right , but i guess since nfl players don't play for so many years , the average lifetime earnings of engineers are higher ."
639,"yeah , you have to figure we mostly hear about the top players who make a ton , but the average guys don't make as much as say le'veon bell . i think the average career is like a few years in the nfl ."
640,he made 12 . 1 million in 2017 but had not been paid anything this season .
641,right . did you know they track player and football movement now through chips ?
642,"yeah , lots of cool technology in football these days . espn got an emmy for the superimposed yellow line ."
643,i can't imagine watching football without that yellow line . do you like basketball better than football ?
644,i do find basketball more interesting . i find it funny that the inventor of basketball is the only losing coach in the university of kansas's history .
645,haha that is funny . must have been a while ago . do you have a favorite team or player ?
646,i guess the golden state warriors since i am from that area . how about you ?
647,i'm a knicks fan . not a lot of good things to say about them these days . they have a tough time putting 5 decent guys on the court .
648,i like seeing basketball players slam dunk .
649,"me too , it was banned periodically from college basketballi"
650,that was because of kareem abdul jabbar right ? pretty funny !
651,hi do you like basketball ? did you know the inventor of basketball is the only losing coach in the university of kansas' history ?
652,i do follow basketball closely from time to time and no i didn't know that about inventor of basketball .
653,"i do not know a lot about the sport but i do know about a few players , like kareem abduljabbar . his dunk shot got banned from college basketball ."
654,wow ! ! do you know the length of this particular ban ?
655,apparently they banned the dunk for over a decade .
656,thanks i didn't know this . how many points is a field goal worth in basketball ?
657,i just learned a field goal is worth two points but i thought field goal were in football not basketball .
658,thanks . how much is it worth behind the three point line ?
659,i think it is worth three and that is why it has the name three point line . but i know so little of the sport . i know that basketball games can't tie and must play overtime for a winner .
660,does time stop when someone gets fouled in basketball ?
661,"yes . i just learned after a foul , time played stops and the player fouled against or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more onepoint free throws ."
662,thank you so much . you mentioned earlier about the inventor of basketball do you know by any chance his name ?
663,"yes . his name is james naismith . he was a college coach . in 39 out of 50 states , the highest paid state employee is either the college football or basketball coach ."
664,thanks . i didn't know anything about this . very interesting . do you know how many players are in each team that play basketball ?
665,i know when the game is active there are five players each on the court . i am not sure how many or on the bench .
666,thanks . i heard that the new zealand basketball team have a nickname do you know what they are called ?
667,i just learned they are nicknamed the ' tall blacks . ' i think they could have come up with a more appropriate name .
668,me too ! ! they could of come with a much better name than that .
669,"here's a fun fact , the us supreme court building has a basketball court on the top floor and it is known as ' the highest court in the land '"
670,i'm very surprised with this fact . thanks for chatting with me today . i hope you have a nice evening ! ! ! bye
671,thanks for chatting as well . i learned a lot of new and fun information . goodbye .
672,"hi , how are doing this fine evening ?"
673,"good . enjoying some of the extra time i have now that the nfl season is over . the season runs for 17 weeks , so it lasts a few months"
674,quite true . i didn't get a chance to watch the sb . i'm surprised that an average nfl game has only 11 minutes of action . i thought it would be more .
675,i guess all the stops and talks about stats make it seem longer . i wonder how they kept track of all the stats before they embedded the ball and shoulder pads with chips to measure
676,"i think the chips for tracking are good . i bet it helps with strategy , but also maybe with profiling injuries ."
677,it's possible . did you know women can play in the nfl if they meet eligibility requirements ? i'm surprised by that .
678,"i guess for some positions , it could work . kicker . punter . place holder ."
679,"maybe . there's still a risk , but at least the playoffs are single elimination rather than best out of 4 like the mlb"
680,"i think it would create controversy , which the league likes because it attracts viewers . then again , would you rather have your daughter be an nfl player , or an engineer ?"
681,"engineering is a hard field for women too due to discrimination , but over a lifetime , they'll make more money on average than football players ."
682,"true , and we need all the engineers we can get ."
683,whereas there are many men who will play football . it's interesting how the nfl is divided into the nfc and afc
684,"i think historically there were a couple of leagues brought together in the 60s , when top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars"
685,that's definitely changed with how televised football has become . espn knew what they were doing by creating the superimposed line for the first down
686,that line seems so basic ! how did they win an award for it ?
687,i guess no one had thought of how important it would be for those viewing on television . it's funny how simple things can make a big difference . i wonder what rb benjarvus greenellis' secret was to never having a fumble in his career
688,he had special gloves ? i dunno . a great feat . i hope he got a bonus .
689,still not as unbelievable as the georgia tech game against cumberland . 2220 is a tough break for the loser
690,"i hope that gt put in their third string . that's a horrible score . what was the spread , i wonder ."
691,who knows . i wonder how many of those players went on to play in the nfl
692,"i don't think the nfl existed at the time . college ball was the big thing . anyways , great chat !"
693,it's very possible !
694,do you like to watch football ?
695,love football . . i like the titans .
696,i don't really like football . maybe it's because each nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay
697,there is a lot of action in those 11 minutes .
698,"even so , i get bored in between . it's interesting how much nfl has gained in popularity . the top bowlers made twiceas much as top football stars in the 60s ."
699,i think engineers make more than football players .
700,"yes , over a lifetime it seems they make more . but i don't think that accounts for sponsorships some nfl players get"
701,some are smart business men . . how many teams are in the nfl ?
702,as far as i know there are 32 teams .
703,super bowl is coming soon ! ! first sunday in february .
704,i might get together with some friends for that . who are you rooting for ?
705,i wish the titans were going but they aren't so we shall see ! ! i'm excited for lamar jackson youngest rookie to make it to the playoffs .
706,it's interesting how much technology there is in football these days to make sure things are accurate
707,espn won an emmy for using the yellow line .
708,and now there are tracking ships in shoulder pads and footballs to track various things
709,that's amazing . do you have a favorite team ?
710,i do not . perhaps i would say the 49ers simply because i'm from there .
711,the 49ers had a few good games this year .
712,i haven't really been following .
713,you like watching the halftime shows ?
714,"i think they are exciting , yes ."
715,did you know the nfl has no written rule against femal players ?
716,i did ! i wish more women met the eligibility requirements so we could see them in action .
717,"well , there won't be much action . an nfl game actually only has 11 minutes of live gameplay !"
718,the real game play to watch is from the chips in their shoulder pads showing their moves .
719,"yeah , apparently they put chips in their shoulder pads !"
720,do you like basketball ? i like the smaller team of 5 as opposed to the larger football teams .
721,i watch it sometimes . they banned the dunk for awhile because kareem .
722,what did kareem do ? did he play for kansas where james naissmith was a losing coach ?
723,he was just a really good player that could slam dunk .
724,he should have gone into coaching . some of the highest state paid employees are coaches .
725,i believe it . did you know espn won an emmy for the first down marker ?
726,i did not ! pretty cool ! almost as cool as playing basketball at the us supreme court on the top floor !
727,"interesting , they have a court up there ?"
728,they do ! i would love to play and take into over time by tying the game to get some extra time up there .
729,well in the 1960s top bowlers made twice as much as football stars .
730,that's amazing since bowling is not very popular . i love to bowl even though i am not very good .
731,"i bowl in a league , but i don't make any where near a football star ."
732,do you know the dimensions of a bowling ball ? i believe they are bigger than a basketball at 9 . 4 inches in diameter .
733,i don't know . but i think some are bigger than others depending on weight .
734,it would be an interesting sight to see a bowling bowl go through a basketball hoop of 18 inches in diameter .
735,that would be hilarious .
736,hey there you a football fan ? i love the american version but not so much the rugby or australian rules variation .
737,i love football ! did you know that the nfl has no written rule against female players ? a woman would be allowed just as long as she met the requirements .
738,i would love to see that ! she probably wouldn't mind playing at the university of iowa with the pink locker room !
739,"agreed . it'll happen eventually , especially now that there are female refs . i wonder if they'd be allowed to eat in the same restaurants . . saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat in a restaurant a player is in and if the player comes in while the cheerleader is eating , she has to leave ."
740,true . that is an odd rule . not sure if i agree . the nfl also uses tracking chips in the players shoulder pads to track movement .
741,very interesting ! and an average nfl game has only 11 mins of live gameplay .
742,wow . too much time for ads lol . engineers even make more lifetime earnings than most nfl players !
743,"i believe that . are you a fan of basketball ? the inventor of basketball , james naismith , is the only losing coach in the history of the university of kansas . pretty ironic ."
744,yes i love bball ! very ironic . i wonder who the best coach in kansas history is . the new zealand basketball team is nicknamed the all blacks !
745,a little inappropriate but if it doesn't bother them then ok ! haha did you know the the us supreme court building has a bball court on the top floor and it's called ' the highest court in the land ? '
746,"i would love to play on the highest court in the land . college coaches get paid so much , they are the highest paid state employees in 39 out of 50 states ."
747,"me too . that's pretty wild , i would have thought it would be football coaches or players would be top paid . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football players !"
748,"me too . that is a funny stat , never would have expected that . i love watching football on tv . i remember watching greenellis because he never fumbled the ball ."
749,oh yeah the player on the pats . that's awesome . i love watching football too . i'm already looking forward to next season . the highest score ever in a football game was 2220 . i'd call that a shut out .
750,yeah no doubt . that happened back in 1916 i don't think that would ever happen currently .
751,"definitely not in the nfl with only 11 minutes of game play . also , i didn't know this until recently , but the nfl also uses chips inside the footballs to track the velocity , speed , and location ."
752,that explains how they get such accurate stats and stuff . they also put the chips in the shoulder pads to track player movement .
753,"well with it being the highest professional level of american football , i know the nfl definitely invests in the best technology ."
754,yes you said it right . with only 17 regular season games they have to pack it all in ! well i really enjoyed conversing with you !
755,"yes , definitely a good conversation ! have a great day or night !"
756,unfortunately no football to watch this weekend because the superbowl already happened ! bye now !
757,"hi , do you like football ? by football i mean nfl football ."
758,"i love watching both nfl and college , how about you ?"
759,i mostly just watch nfl but i do watch some college too . now is the hardest time of the year . super bowl over . it's a long ways until september . .
760,"right , at least they have that new league , but i don't watch it . do you have favorite teams ?"
761,me either . i don't really have a team i'm a die hard fan of since there is no nfl team where i live . did you know the nfl puts chips inside the footballs to measure velocity and rotation ?
762,"there is no nfl team where i live either , i like the iowa hawkeyes though for college . i never knew about the chips that is interesting ."
763,"they are even inside players shoulder pads too ! i think that is to measure how hard of a hit they are taking , or giving ."
764,"wow , i wonder if they are created by the engineers who make more money in their lifetime than nfl players"
765,probably ! the time it would take to design that . also making them small enough so they are noticed by the players . i think the average nfl salary is low because their careers are so short and unlike other sports they all have non guaranteed contracts .
766,"for sure , you only hear of the star players making the big bucks . have you ever heard the worst score in college football ever ?"
767,"i did , but i don't recall . i remember it happened a long time ago and was super embarrassing . i take it you know ?"
768,"it was 2220 in 1916 , georgia tech vs cumberland . i would have quit after that game lol"
769,wow ! i was thinking maybe 100 point spread . they could have at least shown mercy . i guess back then teams were a lot more ruthless . too bad espn wasn't around then i'd love to watch the highlights and see the faces of the cumberland players .
770,right or just left the field to never play again lol . i would hope a mercy rule was created after that game
771,or at least some kind of gentleman's agreement where you stop trying to score more points which is probably what would happen now . it was a different time back then .
772,"for sure , a lot different back then . nowadays they have pink locker rooms for college lol"
773,"i saw that , although i don't think that would really bother the visiting team much . they are so focused on the game ."
774,actually the pink messes with them . pink is a calming color and relaxes them extra
775,i guess that makes sense . did you know espn created the superimposed yellow line for 1st downs before any other broadcast network ? they won an emmy for it !
776,wow ! i never knew that ! i used to think it was real growing up lol . it was so nice chatting with you !
777,have a great night !
778,thanks you as well !
779,i read a lot of sports illustrated . im a big fan of the nfl
780,"interesting . i'm a space junkie , and i'm jel of the internet speed that the international space station has ."
781,i heard its faster than ours here in the us . is that true ?
782,"it sure is . it's weird that there are more automated software programs on the internet , than humans ."
783,maybe its trying to stop people from clicking links on the internet . it can be an addiction
784,"maybe , as egosurfing is very real . i've never looked myself up , though ."
785,do you you read the full terms when buying a product online ? only 7 percent of people do
786,i do not . are you a snoop dogg fan ? he wrote a song for his son's football team . how cool is that ?
787,that is pretty cool . i wonder if the song is longer than that the length of live game play in the nfl which is only 11 mins
788,i don't know . it's amazing that college football teams have 14 of the largest stadiums in the world . i would have thought those would belong to nfl teams .
789,they even have a pink visitors locker room located at iowa !
790,"that's funny . surprisingly , the coaches of the military football teams , are the highest paid employees at the department of defense . seems a little silly that they are worth more than the people who put their lives on the line to keep us safe ."
791,in many states coaches are also the highest paid person
792,that's insane . so is the stadium in tx that cost 60 million . . . for a highschool team .
793,was that all paid my taxes ? you have to wonder
794,"who knows . it's a little disgusting to think that they spend so much money on a tracking chip that monitors players every move , and all the stats of a football , yet . . . we don't have those capabilities on cars ."
795,maybe its because the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than that of a player . got to learn how to keep them healthy
796,"there is a rocket scientist who coaches in the nfl . matt patricia , ever heard of him ?"
797,i have ! he coaches the lions . thats a crazy career path for a person
798,"his school's fight song has six digits of pi in it , that would be a fun school to attend ."
799,thats funny
800,"thank you for chatting with me , have a wonderful day ."
801,you as well thanks
802,good morning .
803,good morning . do you follow football ?
804,"off and on . i do watch it occasionally , both college and the nfl ."
805,"i first learned football in high school just sitting in the stands . i wasn't there , originally , for it , but i got to learn the rules and such . it sure helped me count or math by 7s !"
806,"that is an interesting skill to pick up by watching football . for how long of a game it is , it is surprising that they average game only has 11 minutes of live play time ."
807,"i wonder how that compares to baseball , which is often regarded as a boring , noaction sport . soccer and hockey have continuous action , by comparison . i'll be the highestscoring game ever , a 2220 rout , had more than 11 minutes . it would certainly take me more than 11 minutes to run 222 football fields ."
808,that is a huge score for 1 football game . i would have likes to see that . too bad that was in 1916
809,"i think it would have gotten boring after they reached 60 points , then exciting again after 100 , when the novelty of it is just ' how high can they go ' and ' will the other team score at all ? ' i'm much more interested in the strategy behind the game . only real players can give you that insight , like paul zimmerman , who wrote for sports illustrated ."
810,"yeah , i know he was highly respected and it was very sad when he passed away ."
811,"i love hearing those more technical aspects of the game , ' behind the scenes , ' like he was able to give . have you learned such tidbits about football or other sports ?"
812,i think the funniest fact i ever heard about football was that the university of iowa painted the locker room for the visiting team totally in pink .
813,"pink . . . did you know that 100 years ago , pink was the color for baby boys , not blue ? it's a fact i heard on the internet , so it must be true ."
814,"i had heard that too . people don't believe me . the internet does had a vast tange of information , but it isn't all accurate , that's true ."
815,"i'm largely skeptical too . for instance , i can't believe that the current library of alexandria has saved a copy of the internet . what does that even mean ? explain that to me , internet !"
816,how exactly do you save a copy of the internet . that sounds like a bogus claim . did you know people can get an addiction to the internet ?
817,i'm pretty sure i'm addicted to it . at least some aspects like social media . you ?
818,"i try to limit my time on social media , but , yeah i spend more time than i should on it . it's just amazing that the internet connects you to people worldwide ."
819,"it does . my grandfather , who immigrated from eastern europe , still connects with other refugees via skype . in his eyes , it has to be true magic ."
820,"that is amazing . i just learned the other day , that 'internet' comes from the contraction of interconnected network . i never realized that is what the name meant ."
821,"i never knew that . i just knew that internet is supposed to be capitalized , in english at least , like we give it the respect of a proper title ."
822,"really ? i didn't know that . did you read that on the internet ? ; ,"
823,"autocorrect , the greatest gift to us from steve jobs , always seems to correct me when i type it . and yes , internet tells me how to spell its , his ? her ? , name ."
824,"autocorrect is pretty great . well , i am off to do some research via the internet . thanks for the chat ."
825,hey did you ever read any articles by paul zimmerman ? he just passed away
826,yes they were great articles about football .
827,yes i agree . what you lived until 86 so that was a full life i think . i think is most famous book was a ' thinking man's guide to pro football '
828,speaking of football . so many countries call other sports football
829,yes there are a lot of different versions of football . one of them is australian rules football and another is rugby football
830,they are known as football codes
831,yep that's true . do you ever watch football on tv ? do you know who invented the yellow line that shows the first down ?
832,i don't know . did you know a high school stadium cost 60 million to build
833,"no i didn't . that's quite an amount ! also quite an amount , is that bowlers in the 60s made 2 times as much as top football stars at the time"
834,"i did hear that . those huge flags they have at the games cost 50 , 000 and weigh 1 , 100 lbs !"
835,"that's very impressive ! i would never buy one of those personally haha . what do you think about the patriots running back benjarvus greenellis ? he's never fumbled the football , he's awesome !"
836,that's awesome . did you know they put tracking devices in the shoulder pads and football
837,no i didn't know that . do they take them off when they're done playing ? that sounds like a breach of privacy to me
838,it's to track the players moves and distance of the football during the game .
839,"ok that makes sense . they should track the average nfl game length , apparently it's only about 11 minutes of live gameplay"
840,that's such a short time for a game that seems so long . the first n playoff game was played in 1932
841,that's a long time ago ! i wonder if they recorded the first game ? do you know that females can actually play for the nfl too ? there's no rule against it
842,not sure if they recorded but the field was only 80 yards . do you think a female will ever play ?
843,yes i think that one will eventually . they will be a kicker or something to start . i'm just shocked that an engineer will make over their lifetime more money than an nfl player
844,probably be their careers are long and not as physical . matt patricia is a coach and he's a rocket scientist
845,yeah he seemed really smart . how often do use the internet by the way ? have you ever clicked the hamburger button before ?
846,"hello , do you like football ?"
847,i do like football but i like the internet better . do you use the internet much ?
848,yes i do . i use it daily .
849,"there are a lot of little known facts about the internet . for instance , did you know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button ?"
850,"yeah i did that is really interesting , i wonder why it is called a hangurger . apparently , constant clicking can cause an addition ."
851,"or , a hamburger looks like that icon , two buns with the hamburger in the middle , get it ? anyway , yes i agree that constant clicking can cause an addiction . i think i've got that one as well ."
852,"oops , sorry about the spelling error . you have an addiction to clicking ? are there any support groups that help with this addiction ?"
853,"funny , not that i've heard of but one never knows what could started . another funny fact is that only 7 percent of people read the full terms when buying a product or service on the internet . i , myself am guilty of that sometimes ."
854,i believe that for sure . it full terms is so much reading and sometimes hard to understand .
855,"true , it can get complicated . even the internet itself can be hard to understand with its vast range of information resources and services like hypertext documents , www , email , and file sharing ."
856,yeah . did you know there is 3g cell service at the top of mt . everest ?
857,"wow , imagine that ? i couldn't imagine how that happened but i do know that the current library of alexandria has a saved copy of the internet in case of catastrophe ."
858,"now you can take selfies and post them when you get to the top of the mountain lol wow , the internet is backed up , thats cool ."
859,"and also consider how huge the internet is . since its a network of networks that consists of private , public , academic , business , and government networks of local to a global scope , it's size is immeasurable to me ."
860,"yeah , the internet is amazing , it's so convenient . i can't imagine doing research the old fashion way . or even using a phone book lol"
861,"yes , technology has taken over most manual processes for sure . even the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in the player's shoulder pads to records all of their moves ."
862,"also , in the football !"
863,"yes , they put a chip in the football to record and track the velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location of the football which probably saves a lot of time ."
864,"yeah , looks like technology has made a great impact on football and other sports ."
865,"yes , i think it will help to give more game play time . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
866,"its been good talking to you , have a good one ."
867,"hi , do you watch football ?"
868,"i'm not really a fan , but i compete with my brother to pick the most winning teams each week ."
869,nice . did you know women can play too ?
870,"we actually had a girl on the football team where i went to high school , though i have never seen a girl play football professionally ."
871,"me either , would like to see them though playing there"
872,i'm sure popular football writer paul zimmerman would be surprised to see it happen .
873,"yeah , too bad he passed away"
874,he had been having poor health for a while . it's good to know he isn't suffering anymore .
875,yes that is true . did you know there is only 11 minutes of gameplay in a game
876,there are four quarters of 15 minutes each . how are there only 11 minutes of actual play ?
877,i guess there is a lot of getting in position and stuff that does not count
878,"not like the sport called ' football ' in other countries , what we call soccer , there is always action in that game !"
879,yeah that is for sure . do you use the internet much ?
880,i am actually addicted to the internet .
881,yeah me too i think actually you can develop addiction from clicking too much
882,email and file sharing are very useful internet services that i use daily .
883,those sure are . do you know what hamburger has to do with the internet ?
884,"i'm not really sure , though sometimes i get hungry when using the internet and order dinner to go from an online food delivery service ."
885,yeah those are convenient . it is the three horizonal line menu
886,i wonder why it is called a hamburger menu ?
887,i guess it looks like one . nice chat
888,"hello , lets talk abut the nfl . did you know that there is no written rule that women can not play ?"
889,"hi , yeah , i had heard that . wonder why one hasn't tried to play , yet ?"
890,"if they meet the leagues's eligibility requirements they could play , i wonder what the requirements are ."
891,"probably physically tougher than a lot would want to attempt . a kicker would make a nice start , though !"
892,"the games seem so long while watching , but there is only 11 minutes of live game play on average"
893,i feel your pain ! the last super bowl dragged on over three hours . too much standing around and other nonsense . it should be streamlined and made faster .
894,did you know that over a life time an engineer can make more money then an nfl player
895,"wow , that's interesting . but , i guess that's an average player , not a tom brady type . do you have a favorite team ?"
896,"patriots are mine , what about you ? engineers can also make more then an mlb player over a lifetime"
897,"new england patriots are my favorite team , also ! go pats !"
898,there are tracking chips that are located in player's shoulders pads to track them on the field
899,"i read there are also chips placed in the balls that track various things , as well . the nfl is getting so high tech , aren't they ?"
900,"yes , lets talk about the nba next . nike used to pay the fine for jordan to wear air jordan's"
901,"i remember when they were banned when they first came out . nike had the money to pay all those fines , it didn't matter they made it all back from the exposure it gave them . everybody wanted a pair of air jordan's !"
902,tim duncan could have went straight to the nba but decided to stay in college instead .
903,"that was very smart of him to do . always good to have a fall back career , in case basketball doesn't work out . the statistics are not good for the average player after leaving the game . within 5 years , most are bankrupt ."
904,"interesting , i dont think that will happen to allen iverson since he signed an endorsement deal with reebok paying him 32 million at age 55"
905,he made one good deal ! i would like to have him negotiate for me ! lol
906,"i agree , it also pays him 800 , 000 a year which sounds like a really good deal to me"
907,do you have a favorite basketball team ?
908,i dont really . you ? reggie miller's sister was also very good at basketball breaking 8 national records . nice talking to you today
909,it's almost superbowl time ! ! did you know that the highest score in a football game was 2220 in 1916 ? georgia tech did that ! ! ! pretty impressive !
910,it is almost super bowl ! ! ! i am so exited . who are you rooting for
911,"i don't really have a preference . . . just looking forward to a good game . . the nfl uses tracking chips inside the shoulder pads that track the player's moves . . . rotation , velocity , speed , all that's tracked ! !"
912,i will be using chips super bowl weekend too ! i'm leaning towards doritos . . . . di you know steve smith when he played ?
913,"no . i'm not familiar with him . i recently found out though that the nfl has no written rule against female players ! as long as they meet requirements , they can play ! ! that's interesting !"
914,yeah . i am not sure i have the stomach to watch a woman play against some of those men .
915,"well , one thing for sure is she has to be able to hold her own to get out on the field . players have to be mentally ready for the challenge , whether male or female . . . its pretty demanding . . . and could lead to anxiety !"
916,i wonder if she could eat at the same restauarants as the players . the saints cheerleaders cannot . . . .
917,i know ! ! that's an odd rule . being able to relax and enjoy good company might be what is needed to get rid of depression . steve smith probably could have used a little laughter and fun when he was struggling in 2014 .
918,he has been in 2 or 3 known fights with team mates . he broke one of their jaws and he was out for like 8 weeks . i wonder if all the head collision has anything to do with it ?
919,could be ! ! he admits that the demons he fights are inside . . . but he's learning to cope with them and to understand things and seek help . that's a start !
920,yeah . i worry about the mental health of these football players . a lot of pain and depression in the whole league .
921,"yes , i agree . smith has some advice to anyone suffering from depression . he recommends asking for help ! he wants to relay the message that they are not alone and there's help ."
922,most nfl teams have a psychologist on staff . i hope they reach out to them when they need it . i know a lot of players are retiring early . . .
923,yes they are . . . theysend powerful messages to fans everyday with the actions that they choose . like tim duncan of the san antonio spurs . . . he chose going to college for four years over going into the nba and making loot !
924,yeah . i am glad he didn't get hurt . it's always a fear of mine when people go back to college instead of the league .
925,"absolutely . . . there's always the fear of missing an opportunity ! they have to weigh their options closely when making life changing decisions , just like anyone else ."
926,most athletes are now being told to go pro to end their rookie contract a year earlier . it's that second contract that makes all the money .
927,"well , sometimes it pays not to listen so much but to take risks and go against the grain ! like michael jordan . when he first introduced jordan's to the nba , they were banned ! imagine that . but mike kept wearing them anyway , faithfully , and nike had his back , they agreed to pay all fines ! !"
928,he's the one that put nike on the map !
929,"absolutely ! ! ! well , its been nice talking to you ! ! i hope you enjoy the rest of your day ! ! stay warm ! ! goodbye !"
930,you too !
931,"hi , how are you this morning ?"
932,"lol . . . . just trying to wake up ! i hope you're well , how's your sports chops in football and basketball ?"
933,"i'm good , thanks for asking . i love football more than basketball , but only by a little !"
934,we match perfect then . shame that tom bensen of the saints passes away after his team was ripped off this year in the playoffs .
935,"yeah , i was sad to hear that ."
936,"though in the national football league my favorite team is the browns . , and it hasn't been easy being a fan of them in the last 25 years , but this year they were a lot better with baker mayfield and the gang ."
937,"yes , i agree the browns have had a tough time of it , but things are looking up for them . did you watch the superbowl ?"
938,"no , not this year . it's the first super bowl i've ever missed . i was boycotting the game , because i didn't think the rams belonged in it . the new orleans saints were a far better team , and they got ripped off ."
939,"i agree with you on that . i watched just to see if the goat , tom brady could pull off another one and he did . lol"
940,yep ! i did bet the patriots to win that and i won a little coin . thanks football !
941,cool beans ! you know i've played football since little league and watched it all my adult life and i was shocked to find out that there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay .
942,"i know , i can't believe that . next year when a football game is on , i'm going to have to grab a stopwatch and actually time the gameplay . . . . i still can't believe it's only 11 minutes ."
943,do you ever wonder why the nfl doesn't have a female player yet ? i mean there is no rule against female players .
944,"i've known a couple female football players in my life , and they were good ; it's just that they both agreed that they aren't anywhere as near as strong as males . i think that's the whole thing . would like to see it though ."
945,me too . a nice jiggly one ! not a big bertha !
946,"lol . . . . man , we do think the same . i haven't watched any of the national basketball association since cleveland lost lebron james , yet again , . but , we understand why he left . and go figure , it may be his first time in forever that he may not make the playoffs . good for that silly laker team"
947,that's so true . do you know that the granny style of shooting is the absolute best technique for scoring points on the line ?
948,"wow . . . never knew that ! hey , have you watched any of the new alliance of american football yet ? it's not too bad , and i've bet all 8 games this year , and won 6 . they set the over or under way too high for guys that barely practiced as of yet . i'll bet the betting lines go way down this next week ."
949,"nope , i haven't caught any of those games , yet ."
950,"you'll have to check one out . decent football . well , it's been nice chatting with you this early . good luck in picking up good payers on mturk today . and have a great day my friend !"
951,"you too , my friend !"
952,to the next survey . . . . lol .
953,do you like the nfl ?
954,i do . did you hear they are using tracking chips on the players now
955,oh cool what for ? did you know women can play too ?
956,on nice . yes they are tracking velocity and rotation and stuff like that
957,nice . i hope they can use that to make the game safer too .
958,good point . so how come women can play too ?
959,"well there is no written rule against them playing so if they make the cut , they play"
960,i see . did you know there is a coach who used to be a scientist ?
961,"i have not heard of that one , who is it ? do you know how long the gameplay is"
962,"it is matt patrica . i have no idea , is it not the entire game ?"
963,nope it is actually 11 minutes the average
964,and yet we are glued to the tv for hours for the game to end
965,true . did you know engineers make more than football players over the lifetime ?
966,i guess they have longer careers too though to maybe more time to make money
967,true . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
968,oh wow no did not know that . did you know more than half of the largest football stadiums are in the us ?
969,i guess that makes sense it is such a popular sport here now
970,true . do you know how much the flags in the stadiums weight ?
971,"i have no idea but i bet you it is a lot , they are huge"
972,"yes , they weight 1100 pounds an cost about 50 000 to make"
973,wow that is amazing . it was nice chatting with you .
974,"are you a nfl fan ? there are currently 32 teams , i'm a huge giants fan"
975,"i am a broncos fan , and i love football . the 32 teams are divided into two conferences nfc and afc"
976,"yep , it's the highest level of american footbal with 16 regular season games a year"
977,they get to rest one week
978,yep . the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements . i wonder if there will ever be a female player anytime soon
979,that would be fun . it would have to be a very strong one . and i found it very hard to believe that in average and nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual play
980,"well they do take a lot of time to set up between plays , kickoffs , timeouts so i can see how there is only 11 minutes of actual action"
981,i enjoy the whole game . there is so much we can know about the players because they are using tracking chips that they locate in the player's shoulder pads .
982,"yea , and they also put chips in the ball to track velocity , rotation , speed , and location . pretty wild"
983,"that makes it way more interesting , did you know the new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating i the same restaurants as the players ! ! kind of crazy"
984,"yea , i read about the cheerleader not being allowed to eat with the saints players . i think the cheerleaders are suing the team"
985,"the should . if they are already eating there and a player comes in , they have to leave . i think this is can not be real !"
986,if they have to the players and cheerleader separate it should be whoever comes in last
987,hopefully that will be changing pretty soon . i found amusing that the university of iowa's locker room for the visiting team is painted completely pink !
988,i found it funnier top bowlers made twice as much as football player in the 1960s
989,"wow how differerent it was ! ! there is a game i would like to watch and it was played in 1916 , the score was 222 to 0"
990,"yea i might have to youtube that georgia techcumberland game too , well if it's on film"
991,hopefully it is . we are getting close to the superbowl which is the second week of february !
992,"yea , that's awesome , hopefully they stick to the superimposed yellow line that won espn an emmy and not try any other stuff"
993,the playoffs are actually like another tournament consisting of six teams of each conference . that is when it starts to be way more exciting !
994,"yep , i wonder if benjarvus greenellis is still playing , he's never fumbled the football in his nfl career"
995,"there are other types of football like the australian , rugby and gaelic , but nfl is my favorite ! well it was super nice talking to you !"
996,do you like watching football ?
997,hi . yes i love watching football . how about yourself ?
998,"sometimes i do but i have to be in the mood . it's sad that football players , even though they are successful , they suffer from depression as well ."
999,yes i agree . some players have reported feeling free after retiring .
1000,"steve smith is known as a tough wide receiver but throughout his career he felt trapped , inferior and alone ."
1001,yes its amazing the grip depression has over some lives .
1002,his own words were overwhelmed and broken .
1003,sometimes the best thing players and others can do is to get help .
1004,"a philadelpha eagles great brian dawkins even said he was considering suicide , but thinking of methods that his family could collect life insurance on . yeah , getting help is a must but sometimes kind of tough ."
1005,i agree . it is tough i have needed to get help myself .
1006,hours upon hours of counseling is sometimes needed even for nfl players
1007,do you like basketball any ?
1008,"yes , i like it better than football . how about you ?"
1009,yes i do too .
1010,do you ever see nba players shoot granny style ? apparently that is actually statistically the best technique .
1011,i can not say that i have . that would be very funny though .
1012,"i know , wouldn't it ? do you like the shoes air jordans ?"
1013,my boyfriend loves them . he has too many pairs to even count .
1014,they were banned when they first came out by the nba . jordan wore them anyway knowing he would just pay a fine every game .
1015,its been very nice talking to you .
1016,you too !
1017,"i know depression affects everyone , but that really surprises me that a top nfl player struggles with it"
1018,"i know , i have heard a lot about head injuries with nfl players so i wonder if it is connected"
1019,"that could definitely be a part of it . it's cool that people are talking about it , even people like michael phelps"
1020,yeah it's very groundbreaking for steve smith to speak so openly about his feelings .
1021,"yeah , mental health awareness is important , and i agree with brandon marshall ."
1022,what did he say ?
1023,that mental health awareness is ' the civil rights issue of our era ' at the end of article section 3 .
1024,"i don't have that , can you tell me about it ?"
1025,it's another wide receiver in the nfl agreeing with other athletes who are coming out about mental health issues . he thinks that it is the next social problem we have to solve
1026,"wow , that's very interesting ! so many athletes seem to be speaking up lately like michael phelps , kevin love , demar derozan , brandon marshall , just to name a few ."
1027,i like that steve smith says that having depression doesn't mean there's something wrong with him . i think a lot of times people think having a mental health issue means you're broken
1028,"i know , excactly , just being open like phelps was is great"
1029,what do you think about the nfl in general ? like professional football in general ?
1030,i think it's pretty fun to watch but like i said the fact that all of these players suffer depression it makes me concerned that the players are maybe hurting themsevles !
1031,what do you think the nfl or nba can do about it ?
1032,"i'm not sure , perhaps they can offer the players a large platform to tell people to seek help like brandon marshall did"
1033,"yeah , maybe they can offer them counseling , too , in a more transparent way . there's a lot of money in these leagues , i'm sure they have enough"
1034,"that's true , hopefully they pay for the athletes to have insurance policies which cover all of these mental health needs ."
1035,"and if coaches are talking about this stuff , too , and not just players , it could go a long way towards changing the culture"
1036,yeah which makes sense since people in our culture in all industries like music even have been speaking a lot about mental health
1037,"nice talking to you , take care"
1038,"you too , merry christmas"
1039,merry christmas !
1040,"hi , do you watch football ?"
1041,"i don't , but i do attend a super bowl party on the first sunday of february ."
1042,nice . did you know women can play if they want ?
1043,"yeah , if they met the eligibility requirements . i wonder if that will happen one day ."
1044,"i hpe so , it would be interesting . do you know about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?"
1045,"yeah , that seems pretty sexist . even if the cheerleaders were already eating in that restaurant , they have to leave if the players want to eat there . i mean , i know players are more important to the game , but still ."
1046,"yeah , it is so sexist , i do not see the point of it either"
1047,"i am a woman and don't know if i'd want to play in the nfl even if i could . i'd rather be an engineer . anyway , over a lifetime , engineers make more than the average nfl player ."
1048,yeah and i am glad that is the case because engineers contribute more to the society
1049,"right , though i am sure many engineers do watch nfl games to unwind ! i am not too interested in football , perhaps because there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game ."
1050,i know yet we are glued to the tv for so long to watch the entire thing
1051,yeah . since espn created the superimposed yellow line it has helped out too . they won an emmy for that
1052,that is crazy to win an award for that . did you know now they use chips on the padding of the players ?
1053,"yeah , and in footballs too . the sport of football has sure progressed a lot ."
1054,yeah for sure . do you watch much tv ?
1055,"i don't watch that much . i like to watch comedy , light things . i heard that jim carrey doesn't make dramas anymore because he believes he should only play in movies that project positivity ."
1056,well if that is what he prefers . did you ever watch house ?
1057,i did but i got bored of it . apparently others did not since hugh laurie is the highest paid actor ever for tv drama .
1058,"yeah he made so much money off it , 700 000 per episode"
1059,"wow , that's awesome . i wonder what motivated him to become an actor . for michael caine , it was because all the prettiest girls at his school were in drama class ."
1060,"hahah what a reason , good for him . nice chatting with you"
1061,"hey there , do you like nfl ?"
1062,sure ! have you been following the leveon bell saga with the steelers ?
1063,not so much really . did you know women can play too if they make the cut ?
1064,"yeah , while the nfl has written rules against having female players , what woman in her right mind would choose to do that ?"
1065,"it is a violent sport for sure . but the game only lasts for 11 minutes , play time"
1066,"yeah , but they train for years to play for just a few seconds a game . i could see a female punter doing well , but they only play for seconds per game . and the avg lifetime earnings of an nfl player is less than that of an engineer . women are too practical to make throw away real money on a few seconds worth of playtime ."
1067,new orleans cheerleaders on the other hand are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players . i wonder why that rule is .
1068,another reason why women won't play for the saints . . she would be prohibited from socializing with her cheerleader friends !
1069,strange rules sometimes . it is cool that now the players carry chips on their padding .
1070,"that is the final straw ! tell a woman you if she plays football , you will monitor what she eats , track he every movement , prevent her from socializing , and then televise statistics on he age , weight , and historical choices ? not gonna happen !"
1071,"i think they use the chips for good things though , like hits and such to prevent concussions and stuff"
1072,"hey , the reason that the univ of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink is to help encourage recruitment of female players ?"
1073,i have no idea . do you know what the highest score in a football game was ?
1074,"well , there was a game in college ball where the score was run up to 2220 . georgia tech trounced cumberland . but that was years ago . could be another game too . it would have been hard to keep track of yardage in that game ?"
1075,that is very true . did you know espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line ?
1076,"nice feature ! finally an emmy decision i can agree with . did you know that in greenellis's career with the patriots , he never fumbled the ball ? neither did i , but my nfl career was restricted to a recliner . still , a great accomplishment considering that i had a beer in one hand and chips in the other . . ."
1077,hahaha that is funny . do you watch much tv other than football
1078,"sure . i watch a lot of reruns of classic programs like house , starring hugh laurie . he made 700k per episode for that series , so it's gotta be good , right ?"
1079,yeah that show really rocked so i am not surprised he made that much money .
1080,"laurie is a great actor . unlike the classic overactor , jim carrey , who gave up drama because of ' personal beliefs ' . . . i think when he played the role as andy kaufman it messed with his brain"
1081,seems like it . he has really changed . it was nice chatting with you .
1082,"how's it going , do you follow football ? the redskins have a challenge ahead of them when they play the giants offense"
1083,"i don't watch football much , but it does interest me some . who do you think will win that football game ?"
1084,"probably the redskins , they have a great defense and the giants qb has been playing badly"
1085,"don't barkely and beckham jr . play for the giants , though ? or am i thinking of the wrong nfl team ? they're in the news for being really good lately ."
1086,yea bekham and barkley play for the giants but they were still 16 .
1087,"i see . which nfl team do you think has the best cheerleaders ? i think they're pretty talented , too . and they have danger like the football players , too ."
1088,"no idea , i feel bad for the saints' cheerleader though , they can't be in the same place as the football player"
1089,i don't like how some nfl teams have strange rules like if the cheerleaders are at a restaurant and the football players show up the cheerleaders are expected to leave . very strange .
1090,yea those rules on cheerleaders and players are outdated and sexist
1091,lol those were the same rules you meant ? it is very odd . i think it might have started because it would be too distracting for the cheerleaders and football players to have relationships together ?
1092,i don't think that's an issue on the professional level .
1093,true . i think there's actually a music video made based off of that with football players and cheerleaders like that . i think it's interesting no females have played for the nfl .
1094,maybe there will be a female place kicker soon since there are no rules forbidding women from playing
1095,that sounds like it would be reasonable . i think the average football game only has just over ten minutes of play . think of how much time that leaves for commercials !
1096,i guess that's a big reason benjarvus greenellis has never fumble the ball if he only actually plays less than 10 mins a game
1097,did you know that despite how much nfl players make that engineers make more in a lifetime ?
1098,"that's pretty crazy , plus engineers make more than mlb players too"
1099,i like now the nfl uses chips to track players and the ball . i wish i was the one who invented that or even the one to have the job analyzing the tracking of them . seems interesting .
1100,"yea , maybe one day they will combined the chips with the superimposed first down line espn made for some crazy tv viewing"
1101,that would be interesting almost as interesting as how there's a university where they have the opposingfootball team's locker room painted pink . i'm gonna go watch some netflix now . ttyl
1102,have a good one
1103,hi ! are you a fan of the nfl ? i think it's hard to believe the average game is only 11 minutes long in terms of live gameplay !
1104,"yeah . . . i like alex smith . he's gotten a raw deal in past , like with sf"
1105,true . but he seems to like what he sees with the redskins as they're not like washington teams of the past ! plus they don't like using the word drama too much !
1106,"yeah , no hype . can't hurt to have adrian peterson involved too"
1107,"agreed . so speaking of the nfl , do you think we'll ever see a female player drafted or signed ? they can actually play as long as they meet the eligibility requirements !"
1108,i dunno . . . but i think that would make for quite a drama . patrick stewert would probably lecture about it
1109,ha ! maybe so ! but i don't think anything could be more dramatic in football than if a saints cheerleader is caught dining in the same restaurant as a saints football player . i can't believe there haven't been any lawsuits filed over that misogynistic rule .
1110,at this rate they'll probably insert tracking chips on their cheerleaders .
1111,"yeah , that would be crazy if they did ! those engineers are geniuses . with technology like that , no wonder they make more than the average lifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players !"
1112,"yeah , you don't need to be a rocket scientist to play football . however , it might help . lets see how things work out for matt patricia ."
1113,no kidding ! it takes more physical talent it seems . like benjarvus greenellis who's never fumbled the football in his entire pro career . now that really takes talent !
1114,that's why they make the big bucks . the highest paid people in the military are football coaches
1115,"are they really ? that is almost unbelievable ! but i used to think a yellow first down line was unbelievable as well until espn pulled it off and even won an emmy for it , which they rightfully deserved !"
1116,what unbelievable is that the qb with the most wins in cleveland doesn't play for the browns .
1117,"that is unbelievable and kind of funny ! ha ! on another humorous note , did you know the university of iowa's visiting football team's locker room is actually pink ? that would drive me crazy if i was a visiting football player ! ha !"
1118,well locker rooms are soap operas . they even have soap in them .
1119,"ha ! so true ! and there's a lot of drama like soap operas as well . speaking of drama , can you believe michael caine only became an actor because he said all the prettiest girls at his school were drama students ? i should have taken drama then . ha !"
1120,well joe hamm taught drama in high school . ellie kemper was his student .
1121,"it's a small world , isn't it ? i can't believe hugh laurie of all people is the highest paid actor for tv dramas . he made 700k each house episode . that is insane !"
1122,a few more of those and he could afford a texas high school stadium . . . which cost 60m to build
1123,"holy cow ! i couldn't imagine a high school stadium costing that much to build ! well , i'm off to to visit this website that has thousands of classic radio dramas available to listen to for no charge . it was great chatting with you today ! have a great evening !"
1124,take care .
1125,football apparently comes in different forms and names around the world . what do you think of american football ?
1126,"i like it , im watching the superbowl for sure this year , what do you think about the redskins this season ,"
1127,"they were okay . it was a shame that alex smith , the quarterback , got hurt ."
1128,"yeah i thought they were going to do better , it seems the team has a lot of determination , and it is a shame ."
1129,they have some good players and do things quietly in a way . adrian peterson worked out for them and hardly anything was said .
1130,"they used to have flashy names now the team is decent , fears can always slow you down specially with all the talent out there ."
1131,"true . alex smith is known , he's been around 13 years , but he's not flashy if you know what i mean ."
1132,"yeah i get you , sports what team are you a fan of ?"
1133,"well for the superbowl i can't really decide . i'd like to see the rams win but then again , it'd be great to see drew brees win . what about you ?"
1134,"i am a patriots fan , i really like them i became a fan of the since benjarvus greenellis , so i am rooting for them in this superbowl ."
1135,my bad a bit ago . i was still thinking of the nfc championship game . i am pulling for the rams to win . did you know that greenellis has never fumbled in his entire career ?
1136,"i didnt know that , he is one of my favorite playes but didnt know that about him and what are your thoughts about the nfc championship game ?"
1137,considering the rams player himself admitted that it should have been a penalty i think they should replay the game . i'd like to see what would happen . i also think they should play it out until a winner . let it go like back in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 .
1138,"2200 that is close score lol , i bet the other team retired from football forever ."
1139,that would be pretty bad . so what do you think about the nfc championship game ?
1140,"i thought the saints were going to win , i was kind of rooting for them ."
1141,i had thought they would win for a while too . it was a bit of a surprise . i also thought kansas city was going to beat the patriots . did you know the saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players ?
1142,"i didnt know that , that rule should be abolished , its unfair cheerleaders have to leave if a player arrives ."
1143,it is unfair . the nfl has no rule against women players though so that's fair .
1144,yeah i guess so although i don't see a pro team lining up a woman
1145,i agree . a woman would have to meet eligibility requirements first .
1146,"hi , are you familiar with the nfl ?"
1147,"oh yeah , i'm a chiefs fan ."
1148,"apparently , the nfl has no written rule against female players . it surprised me when i heard about it ."
1149,"yeah , let 'em play as long as men can play women's sports too . i heard the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . they won't get hurt , right ?"
1150,i was surprised to hear about it . what do players do then since 11 minutes is very short ?
1151,"wait . . . i played in hs and they were always moving chains , officiating , timeouts , etc . now they are going to put chips in things like shoulder pads to get even more information ."
1152,technology is available for teams to be more efficient . coaches are smart to take advantage of the available technology .
1153,"yeah , but i wonder if the u . of iowa is smart in painting the visitor's locker room pink ? it may just make them more motivated . . ."
1154,i would be more motivated if i were a member of the visiting teams .
1155,"yeah . as a dude , i don't hate the color pink . i love espn's yellow 1st down line . the best emmy ever awarded !"
1156,i agree with you . i cannot imagine an nfl game without the superimposed yellow line .
1157,"it makes the game more exciting to me . . . wow , former pat' rb greenellis never fumbled in his entire nfl career ."
1158,"it must be very stressful to have that kind of record . as some people say , there is always the first time ."
1159,"yeah , as a rb , that's a tall order . my alma mater once beat cumberland 2220 . i'm not sure i like that . . ."
1160,that was amazing . i wonder if cumberland players were sleep walking .
1161,i wonder if they ever played again . i can't remember playing them when i was there . do you like michael caine . i guess he got his start in acting by taking a drama class because it had cute girls in it .
1162,that was funny because he is a brilliant actor .
1163,"yes , he's cool . so do you follow the redskins ? i guess they have a good defense but they have their challenges too ."
1164,"no , i do not follow the redskins . i would watch any nfl team if they were in the superbowl ."
1165,"same here . all nfl teams are good . funny , even they were sweating playing the 16 giants . i guess even being good against the run may not help against certain teams ."
1166,"i agree with you , all nfl teams are good . anyway , i need to go to bed . it was nice chatting with you . good night ."
1167,what was the issue with le'veon bell ?
1168,i am not sure about that . i think he wanted more money . it was definitely a contract dispute .
1169,which nfl team did he play for ?
1170,"oh , he played for the pittsburgh steelers . he was their running back . if he didn't sign a contract and join any team he wouldn't be able to play for the season ."
1171,oh . i also heard they had someone replacing him at his position . who was that ?
1172,i think it was james conner . he's only been around for two years whereas bell has been around for a while and even been to the probowl twice .
1173,"well , age is always an issue . any reason they did not trade bell ?"
1174,"most likely due to his record . he is a good running back and they need one . however , with connor stepping up his game it seems bell might not be so needed anymore ."
1175,"who would make that decision . the head coach , right ? what is his name ?"
1176,mike tomlin is the head coach and he would be the one to make the decision along with others . tomlin's a good coach so he knows talent when he sees it . word is he's happy with connor's work so far .
1177,i would guess the quarterback has some role too . that big ben guy . do you know his last name ?
1178,"i do , but not sure on spelling . it's rothelsburger . he's a good quarterback that's been around for a while too . i've heard he likes connor as a pass catcher ."
1179,football is a funny game . what about that final game coming up on the first sunday in february ?
1180,the superbowl is coming up . that's the game between the nfc and afc champions . the nfc and afc are divisons of the national football league .
1181,thanks ! how many teams total are in the national football league ?
1182,"there are 32 teams in the league , equally divided between both conferences ."
1183,cool . how long is the regular season ? i know it goes all fall .
1184,they play 16 games and then there are playoff games and the superbowl .
1185,it seems there is a lot of dead time when i watch on tv . do you know how much action there actually is in a game ?
1186,"it seems like i heard there is only about 11 minutes of actual playing time . however , to me it seems like there is more ."
1187,"perhaps , but i guess they know , given all the chips inside footballs and shoulder pads ."
1188,that's true . football is studied quite a bit . i suppose all the different kinds of football are studied .
1189,"other than soccer , are there other types of football ?"
1190,"yes there is canadian football and ruby , and australian rules football ."
1191,do you follow the redskins or any team in particular ?
1192,i keep an eye out for a few specific teams and have many friends who are redskins fans . do you have a particular favorite team or opinion on the redskins ?
1193,"my favorite team is the patriots bur i think the redskins have a nice team , i thinik they have a good qb and could surprise us next season"
1194,there has been recent backlash against the redskins because of their name . how do you think that has affected team morale ? they've also had some qb issues lately . do you think they have that settled ?
1195,"i think they have settled the qb issues , i think the team is motivated and will move forward , hopefully they can add new talents to their roster ."
1196,do you think there will be an adjustment season ? the chemistry and dynamic of the team has certainly changed but i do think they have potential .
1197,"i guess will just have to see how things play out , hopefully they can have a good campaign , do you have a favorite team ? mine is the cowboys"
1198,i thought you said you preferred the patriots ?
1199,"i actually like both teams the same , the cowboys a bit more but in general i just like football , i also like gergia tech"
1200,ah i understand ! i'm sure you know about the crazy georgia tech 1916 game with the 2220 score ?
1201,"i didnt know about that ! that is a crazy victory , it happened back in 1916 so maybe thats why i dont know about it , do you think the other team retired from football ?"
1202,"you know , i don't know enough to say with confidence . the other team was cumberland ? it's not a team that i've heard of . that is an absurd football score though ."
1203,"i would have nightmares about the players of the other teams lol , another interesting fact is how espn won an emmy because of football ."
1204,for the creation of the lines for downs ? i find that very interesting . it's not your average emmy
1205,"yeah , for the creation of the first down yellow line and i agree its not common although it has influence the game for sure ."
1206,do you know what year that happened ?
1207,im not sure but definetely a long time ago .
1208,fair enough . did you know that women aren't technically banned from playing in the nfl ? if a woman met the eligibility requirements it would be permissable for her to play !
1209,i didnt know that but who knows if we'll be seeing one playing anytime soon
1210,yes i think you are right . i wonder if there are male nfl cheerleaders . saints cheerleaders can't eat at the same restaurant as an nfl player . even if the cheerleader was there first they are required to leave !
1211,"that seems really unfair and sexist , that rule make me really angry , the saints should change that ."
1212,do you watch football ?
1213,"yes i do , i am a redskins fan and like the team this year ."
1214,that's cool . the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 !
1215,"that is an epic win ! i wasnt aware of it , what foorball team do you like ?"
1216,i like the eagles . amazing game last week ! did you know an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
1217,"i didnt know that either , interesting stats , it sure seems like a lot longer , do you know other interesting facts ."
1218,it definitely does ! the nfl has no written rules against women players .
1219,it would be interesting to watch a woman play .
1220,"yeah , that aspect is pro woman , but the saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave !"
1221,"thats interesting , i also heard that the iowas university locker room for visiting teams is completely pink ."
1222,that's really funny ! in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars !
1223,"i know , it must be weird to be in a pink locker room , what do you think about the nfl chips ."
1224,it's a little creepy but gives some cool detailed information .
1225,"its interesting , i wonder how those stats change the game ."
1226,i'm not sure . espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games !
1227,"i didnt know they gave emmys for that , what is your favorite nfl team ?"
1228,"yeah , i didn't know that either . kinda neat . i like the eagles !"
1229,"yeah , that an interesting fact for a gathering , i like the patriots and the redskins ."
1230,very cool . espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games .
1231,i wonder if espn won other awards .
1232,former partiots rb benjarvus breenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career ! i learned a lot . thanks for chatting !
1233,are you a fan of the steelers ?
1234,i love football but am not a steelers fan . are you ?
1235,"me either to be honest , i'm a redskins fan . what's your team ?"
1236,bears . how did your season go ?
1237,"terrible , like usual . ever since dan snyder bought them , they stink . how about the bears ?"
1238,"we made the playoffs but lost in the first round thanks to cody parkey's double doink . . . didn't you lose your qb near the middle of the season ? kirk cousins , right ?"
1239,"we did , i think he is good , but not worth the money . they made a huge mistake with rg3 a few years ago ."
1240,mistake ? in letting him go ? drafting him ? shannahan getting him killed ?
1241,"in drafting rg3 . he's a great athlete , but he isn't nfl material . he is just way to small and prone to injuries . which is what happened to him ."
1242,"the shannahans got him killed . i remember seeing nota , big ole dlinman from the ravens , land on him and worried about his health ."
1243,"yeah , i think he ended up going to the ravens . like i said he was really small entering the nfl and he told people here in dc he was gonna bulk up before his 1st season , but he never did ."
1244,he had that track speed which was appealing . do you remember when people that he would be better than luck and thought he should have gone number one overall ?
1245,"yeah , i remember that . the good qbs always tend to have similar traits . they can take really hard hits , stand in the pocket , and are around a really long time ."
1246,yeah and i wouldn't want big ben on my team . would you ?
1247,"i'm not sure . he's pretty good , but he's had some bad off field antics ."
1248,i would hate for him to call out me on the radio like he has a few of his receivers . seems like he tries to be a leader without leadership qualities .
1249,"oh , does he do that ? i didn't know that . hilarious !"
1250,yeah . did you read about leveon bell holding out ?
1251,"oh yeah , i did . was that why ? that's absurd ."
1252,he wanted more than 15m to play running back . 15m just doesn't go as far as it used to
1253,"yeah , man that is a lot of money though . i would totally take it . well , nice chatting with you ."
1254,saquon barkley and odell beckham jr . make a dynamic duo for the ny giants .
1255,"they sure do , and odell has that crazy beef with josh norman as well !"
1256,beckham jr . has always done well against washington db's . averages 8 catches and over 100 yards per gain against them .
1257,that is pretty impressive since the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of game !
1258,and barkley has so many long runs . it's amazing what can happen in those eleven minutes .
1259,"barkley had 7 20 yard rushes not even half way through the season , he is an animal !"
1260,"washington should do well against him . they have stopped david johnson , alvin kamara , christian mccaffery and ezekiel elliott pretty well ."
1261,"that is impressive , those are some of the nfl's best !"
1262,washington will also have to deal with barkley's receiving skills . he is good out of the backfield .
1263,"he sure is , and then pair that with beckham and it can be hard to stop !"
1264,the key to stopping the giants will be to pressure eli manning .
1265,maybe if they do that they can win 2220 like georgia tech !
1266,"maybe . . . that's stretching things . then again , the redskins have alex smith and adrian peterson ."
1267,"that they do , and they are a great tandem , hopefully they stay healthy !"
1268,"healthy is the key . nfl careers are notoriously short , partly due to injury . the average nfl player earns less in their lifetime than an engineer ."
1269,"i have heard that , and engineers certainly have a safer job !"
1270,even worse are fraternizing rules . new orleans saints cheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant as an nfl player . really !
1271,"i have heard that as well , i wonder what the rationale is there ?"
1272,who knows ? yet the nfl has no rules against female players .
1273,"that is true , i wonder what girl has come the closest to playing ! maybe as a kicker ?"
1274,who knows ! the university of iowa's visitor locker room is painted pink .
1275,hello .
1276,"hi , do you like football ?"
1277,i love it . im a steeler fan . how about you .
1278,"i am red skins fan , like the guy who won the contest at at bucs game ."
1279,oh . well im sorry to hear that lol .
1280,"i like what he did , i was force to wear a bucs shirts , but underneath there was a redskins shirt with the number 47 ."
1281,thats funny . did you know the iowa university locker room for visiting team is painted pink .
1282,"no , i did not know that , why did they do this ?"
1283,i would say to pysch the other team out . do you think it worked .
1284,"i don't know , pink , beside being feminine , is quite a neutral color . i would have chosen to decorate the locker with clowns if it was me ."
1285,or like a bloody nightmare on the walls . something crazy like that would be awesome .
1286,i think i would be almost cheating . do you like watching football on tv ?
1287,no it would be funny . cheating happens on the field . lol .
1288,do you think that georgia tech cheated when they won 222 00 against cumberland ?
1289,i think that is just crazy . how could that even happen .
1290,"maybe it was their first game . or they did not have even a team , so cobbled something with a group of somewhat fit students ."
1291,i dont follow what your saying .
1292,"forget , it is too complicated , how would you feel if you won 22200 ?"
1293,"i would feel like a real jerk for running the score up so high , but i suppose i would feel accomplished about my ability to do it ."
1294,"me too , i would feel a little proud , but if i injured myself during the game i would feel really bad , it was not worth it ."
1295,i would say if you are able to beat a team by that much . they are no match physicaly . it would probably be them who needs to be worried about injuries .
1296,"but people hurt themselves without the aid of the others team . do you like the other kind of football , like soccer ?"
1297,not really . i think people hurt themselves because they are giving extra effort because the other team is good .
1298,there could be some rivalries between the players of the same team . but usually it happens in teams that are already struggling .
1299,have a good day . gotta run .
1300,do you like football ?
1301,"i like to go to the games , yes . i've been reading a lot about the redskins ."
1302,oh yeah ? i wish they'd do away with that name already .
1303,why's that ?
1304,"it's pretty offensive , but i guess i'm not surprised ; there are a lot of offensive things in football . apparently , the saints cheerleaders have to get up midmeal and leave if a player comes into the same restaurant ."
1305,"i've heard that as well . yes , i agree there are many offensive things in football . i've even heard that the university of iowa's locker room for visiting teams is painted completely pink ."
1306,"if only we could go back to when bowlers made twice as much as football stars . i'd get into bowling , for sure !"
1307,"i hear that ! but , nowadays , the biggest money is now in football for sure . did you hear what the highest score ever was in a football game ?"
1308,i believe 222 ! during a college football game .
1309,"yes , that 's the same thing i heard . not only was the highest score 222 but the other team only had 0 . that was georgia tech who defeated cumberland way back in 1916 . what an embarrassment that must have been ."
1310,that is a pretty crazy number . did you know the former running back of the patriots never fumbled the ball once ?
1311,"yes , that would be benjarvus greenellis . that pretty unbelievable that he never fumbled the football in his nfl career . not even once ."
1312,i wish americans had rugby football .
1313,"yes , i like rugby football . as far as i know , it's more like soccer but there might be different versions of it as well ."
1314,"i believe it's like soccer , but you can hold the ball . football , after all , is just a sport that involves kicking a ball to score a goal ."
1315,"yes , and scoring is the most important part of the game . did you know that espn won an emmy for creating that superimposed yellow line on the tv screen to signify first down ? that was pretty cool ."
1316,it definitely makes watching the game on tv much easier .
1317,"that's for sure . not to change the subject but let me ask , do you use an iphone ?"
1318,"i do not , but i have a smart phone . crazy how information is just spread with a 2 . 7 ' cable laying across the ocean floor ."
1319,"that's true . even though neither you nor i have an iphone , i heard that it has more computing power that the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent . now , that's something to write home about"
1320,way different than rotary phones . they chose the area code 212 in ny because it was the easiest to dial on rotary phones .
1321,good morning .
1322,good morning ! did you hear about the die hard redskins fan ryan totolo who wore a buccaneers shirt during an on field promotion ?
1323,thats nuts . i am a steelers fan . i would never do something like that .
1324,i'm a steelers fan too ! awesome ! nothing like steelers fans .
1325,nope . most loyal fans in the league . as a steelers fan i am getting sick of the patriots though . lol .
1326,yes . i agree . lol do you ever watch pittsburgh dad on youtube ? you'll have to check him out . funny stuff . did you know that former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled during his career ?
1327,i haven't seen that . i will check it out though . that is pretty amazing to go your whole career without fumbling .
1328,i agree . the highest score ever in a football was in 1916 georgia tech . beat cumberland 2220 . that's a crazy stat there .
1329,i just dont see how that could happen . everything would have to go perfect .
1330,lol it's like a crazy backyard game of football another interesting tidbit is the university of iowa's locker room if painted completely pink for visiting teams .
1331,i wonder if it has any effect on the other team being ready to play or not .
1332,it might . maybe it's for breast cancer awareness ? i think it's funny how they call soccer football in other parts of the world .
1333,yeah we americans are a little different in that regard . they take their soccer seriously in other countries .
1334,yes . i've worked with a few people from england and they were crazy about their soccer . i was just reading something interesting . the president of indonesia realeased 3 pop albums while he was in office .
1335,you would think he would have more important things to do huh .
1336,yes . lol . up until 1805 the runner up in the u . s presidential election automatically became the vice president .
1337,think about if it was still like that today . trump and hillary running this country together . id like to be a fly on the wall in some of those meetings .
1338,lol yes ! i agree . the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana ! lol
1339,"now introducing , president banana . snickers from the crowd . lol ."
1340,"lol the top 3 wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk , washington , and jefferson . i thought someone from this era would have made that list ."
1341,me as well . did you know the presidents guest house is actually bigger htan the white house .
1342,i never knew that . interesting ! too bad we can't have a steeler in politics . i think rocky bleire was in politcs for awhile .
1343,i heard that . well its been good chatting with you . got to be getting ready for work .
1344,hello ! are you a big fan of football at all ?
1345,yep ! da bears ! how about you ?
1346,da vikes lol . i'm from iowa and am a iowa hawkeye fan as well .
1347,well at least we are in the same division . did you know that in the 60's pro bowlers made more money than top football stars ?
1348,dang i should have been a bowler back in the day ! i would have been somebody ! i wish i could have seen the college game that was 2220 !
1349,i think that happened in 1916 . a bit before my time . i guess they didn't have mercy rules back then . lol
1350,way before mine too ! i bet the other team wished it . i wonder if georgia tech painted their locker room pink like iowa does .
1351,"football includes so many types of games . rugby , soccer , and gridiron to name a few ."
1352,and they are all different sports too lol . football is even winning emmy's lol .
1353,i was upset that the patriots won again . although they had a rb that never fumbled the ball in his career .
1354,"that is one crazy stat , was it benjarus greenellis ?"
1355,yep . what do you think of roger goodell ? as president of the league i wish we could vote his butt out !
1356,yes i agree ! he hasn't done much to improve the game like he said he would ! he is so rich from it too !
1357,"speaking of presidents , how do you like the one we have now ?"
1358,no comment . . . i would like to see him release pop albums like the president of indonesia has haha .
1359,no comment ? ! lol . its hard to believe that washington was among the richest presidents in american history .
1360,yes i think jfk and jefferson were up there too ?
1361,"honestly , trump would end up selling more pop albums than most singers today . they would get upset and investigate his street cred . lol"
1362,"hahaha too funny ! if the first president of zimbabwe was called banana , was the second called orange ?"
1363,"nice ! ! zimbabwe , thats in africa . that's where our last president came from . you know , mr . obama . he was from kenya ."
1364,yes that is interesting ! i'm going to look up more crazy facts ! have a great day !
1365,i wonder what interest unicef has in reducing cell phone usage .
1366,i heard they are donating a day of clean water for children in need for every minute you don't use your cell phone .
1367,"yeah , i know . that's why i wondered what their interest was in reducing cell phone usage ."
1368,"that i'm not sure , seems like other things could be given up that would help ease waste produced ."
1369,"yeah , and it's an agency concerned with children , so that's weird . i don't have a cell phone anyway , so i guess it's a moot point ."
1370,"speaking of phones , do you know why new york's area code is 212 ?"
1371,"yeah , they gave the lowest numbers to the cities with the highest populations so it would take less time to dial them on rotary phones . i guess ny was the biggest city at the time ."
1372,"good call , did you ever use one of those rotary phones ?"
1373,"yeah , i'm that age lol . i grew up with a rotary phone in my house . how about you ?"
1374,"yeah same here , we didn't have one very long , but in my friend's basement we still had to use it for years , one buddy was always confused ."
1375,unfortunately with all the automated phone menus these days it would be hard to get by with one any more .
1376,"yeah it sure would , not many people own landline phones anymore , i'm assuming you still do correct ?"
1377,"yeah i have to i live in a wireless dead zone , so i also get internet access through a dsl connection ."
1378,"nice , how about tv , do you watch much nfl football during the season ?"
1379,i don't have tv either . not much of a sports fan anyhow . do you ?
1380,"yeah , but i mainly just follow my local favorite team , they didn't do very well this season ."
1381,what team's your favorite ?
1382,"i like the packers , always have and will . i used to love watching brett favre play . did you know women can technically play ?"
1383,"no , i don't know much about their rules , but i guess they just assumed it was something understood when they wrote the rules and then society changed ?"
1384,i think it would be very cool if a female player made a pro roster and played . it would give hope to young fans out there .
1385,i agree . that would be awesome . nice chatting with you !
1386,do you watch much football ?
1387,"hi ! i really enjoy american football though my peers claim that their version of 'football' is much better , otherwise known as soccer . do you ?"
1388,i'll watch it if it is on but i'm not a huge fan . i confess i don't really understand it .
1389,"so from an 'outsider' , want to take a guess at why the university of iowa's opposing teams locker room is painted completely pink ?"
1390,i'm guessing they did it as an intimidation thing since pink is considered by some to be a girly weak color .
1391,"yeah ! i wonder if it worked and whether they were able to score anywhere close to what georgia tech did in 1916 , when they defeated cumberland by 222 points !"
1392,wow that seems like a complete slaughter . at what point do you just sort of give up when the points go that high ?
1393,"yeah , i think my pride would be very defeated and they probably just let them win when they realized a turnaround wasn't like to happen ."
1394,i was surprised to learn that the nfl has chips in their uniforms and the ball . i wonder what they use the data for .
1395,my guess is to collect information and sell it to teams like what all data is used for but maybe the agents can use it to negotiate better contracts for their players .
1396,that makes a lot of sense . i hope they are using some of it to make the sport safer for the players too . those head injuries are just terrible .
1397,"i agree , football is such a dangerous sports and concussions definitely result from that , since espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line in games , i wonder if the researcher who makes breakthrough findings will win nobel prize ."
1398,i'd be willing to give him one . there are so many reports of post concussion mental health issues . i don't think for the emphasis that we put on football we are doing enough to make sure that we aren't permanently damaging these young men's brains .
1399,"i agree , i actually read a book about this which delve into aaron hernandez , the patriots player who killed people and then committed suicide and researchers are now studying his brain . pretty great of the family to donate his brain for science !"
1400,that is awesome . i hope that some of the research done can help the people that are still dealing with the same issues .
1401,"if you had kids or have kids , would you let them play football or other sports ?"
1402,i do have kids and i want them to play sports but i worry about the impacts . i think it will depend a lot on the local leagues and what they are doing to play safe .
1403,"i know , there are so many advantages of letting kids play sports but when i read about stories , i imagine the worst . the nfl doesn't have written rules against female players from playing , but i think if a female were to play in the game , it would catch everyone's attention and be heavily publicized in the news ."
1404,i think the media would have a frenzy . it would be called radical feminism or women's empowerment . of course all of us stuck in the middle would be like well let's see if she can whup the patriots .
1405,"lol , considering there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay , the female would only have to survive those intense 11 minutes and try not to be tackled by those 300 pound linebackers !"
1406,that's true . i always thought that some of the female soccer players would make excellent kickers .
1407,do you like football ?
1408,i do like it somewhat . i used to love the game but it's so expensive to get tickets now . how about you ? so you enjoy the game ?
1409,"i do enjoy it and yeah tickets are expensive so i usually watch the games at homes with family and friends , did you watch the superbowl ?"
1410,"yes , i was pulling for the underdog , but the patriots are tough . what other kinds of 'football' sports have you ever seen ?"
1411,"i like to watch rugby and soccer as well , rugby has a lot of different rules"
1412,i always am amazed that they don't get hurt more in rugby . i don't understand it but it is interesting especially when they get into those big huddles and push and shove !
1413,did you ever watch the player benjarvus green ellis play ?
1414,"no , who is that ? a football player or a rugby player ?"
1415,"he is a former football players , used to play for the patriots was a rb , well thing is he never fumbled a ball in his career"
1416,that's quite an accomplishment . i imagine a lot of quarter backs would love that stat ! i think it's so funny that the university of iowa painted their visiting team all pink . pretty obvious psychological tactic !
1417,"that sounds like a really funny tactic lol , i guess the other teams are taken suprise by this , at least teams that dont know the locker rooms"
1418,"right ! but why are we so caught up in a silly gender specific color ! since it's not against the rules , i assume some day there will be female players and then there may be lots of feminine things in a locker room ! ha ."
1419,"i guess so , yeah , espn made a great contribution to the game with the yellow first down line ,"
1420,"wow , yes ! you forget how many innovations tv has brought to watching the game . its funny that they won an emmy for it . i only think of emmys as acting awards ."
1421,"yeah me too but i guess the yellow first down line deserves the price , crazy how bowlers made more money and fooball players back in the 60s"
1422,that is funny . i bet that same thing isn't true today . nfl players make so much . can't imagine that its even close to bowler's winnings now . tv has made a big difference in the game . crazy that they actually only play for 11 minutes each game !
1423,"i agree tech has changed the game in some cases for worse but also for the better , did you know the players have chips embedded in their shoulders ?"
1424,i guess that's how they get all those stats . i wonder if they will ever use those chips to determine whether a player steps out of bounds or actually crosses the goal line ?
1425,"i bet they will in a future , the football also has tracking chips , all kinds of cool stats are taken out of them"
1426,"so coaches who contest rulings , may be able to use those chips to get the calls reversed to their side ?"
1427,"that would be a good application for them , but maybe football should stay as is , tech can take the fun out of it sometimes"
1428,hi ! are you a football fan ?
1429,"hi , how are you ? sure !"
1430,"i tend to watch more college ball myself , how about you ?"
1431,i follow the nfl around playoff time . i like those games because the stakes are high and there is a lot of energy .
1432,same here . maybe a bit more than the 11 minutes of average live game play .
1433,"i thought it would be more , but i guess the players are waiting and standing a lot . still lots of injuries in just 11 minutes ."
1434,yeah . had to be a lot more action in that 2220 game . hard to score that much in 11 minutes .
1435,yes . i thought that blowout was cruel . what was the point there ?
1436,"i am not sure . but major kudos to the losing team , it isnt easy to keep going like that but they did ."
1437,"yes , they played the game that should never have been scheduled . i wonder what their coach said to them after the game ."
1438,"i dont know , that would be a hard thing to coach them through . i wonder if there is a mercy rule enacted after that ."
1439,perhaps there is . i thought one team would put in its weakest players to balance things out . maybe even the cheerleaders .
1440,"speaking of cheerleaders , did you hear about how the saints cheerleaders are treated ?"
1441,"the cheerleaders in the nfl are underpaid and overworked . they are sex symbols , but really get little respect ."
1442,they also cant eat in the same restaurant as a player and if a player walks in they ave to leave .
1443,i think that system is sexist . why did they institute that ? was there a problem with romance or something ? is that even legal ?
1444,"i dont even know . i mean if there was a problem with romance , then you address it with the people it applies to . they are adults , they should be responsible for their own decisions ."
1445,exactly . no need for ridiculous rules that make the cheerleaders look like hussies .
1446,for real . i heard they also must block players from following them on social media .
1447,"hm . i guess there have been problems with relationships . well , everybody is entitled to make mistakes . i figure they are responsible adults . anyway , great chat !"
1448,it was a good chat ! have a great night !
1449,did you know that the average nfl game only had 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
1450,"that does not surprise mehere is so much stopping and going . i guess if you add it up over the 16 games a team plays over the course of a regular season , it's a couple of hours haha"
1451,since i do not watch football i would not mind if the games reflected those few hours without the averaging lol
1452,"yes , i think the ways other varieties of football are played in other countries are a more efficient use of time"
1453,possibly . do you think it is really impossible for to separate two phone books that have their pages overlapped ?
1454,"well , i suppose you could just burn them ! it's a good thing they're obsolete ; did you know that in iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent ?"
1455,that is true . it would be less time consuming lol i had no idea . i wonder if that is true for all iphones or any of them .
1456,"it's amazing how physically fragile all of our information systems are , considering how much data they store and move . the phone and internet data cables on the ocean floor are only 2 . 7 ' in diameter !"
1457,it really is amazing . that is such a tiny cable to be responsible for transporting our data . and we trust it makes it even more odd . at least it has been sturdy so far !
1458,"yes , there still is some robustness in metal and plastic objects . remember rotary phones ? ny has the 212 area code because it's the quickest number to dial on one of those ."
1459,rotary phones should make a come back . i want to know why 212 was chosen for new york and not for somewhere else .
1460,"i bet it's because it was the biggest city in america in the beginning of the 19th century , as it is now , . i don't imagine too many people had phones on the west coast back then , it would've been crazy expensive to get those cables in place !"
1461,i was thinking that had to have been the case .
1462,"yes , they didn't really have radio back then , either , and now it's used to transmit internet data and track football players moves via chips in their should pads !"
1463,they really have internet data stored in chips in the shoulder pads of football players ? ?
1464,"well , wifi uses radio waves to relay information , as do rfid chips that they use to track objects' movement and identify pets and stuff ."
1465,i didn't know anyone was tracking football player activity though . i don't know much about football or what they do outside of the field .
1466,"well , both nfl players and those associated with them have to follow rules . new orleans saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as an nfl player !"
1467,their rules need updating a little . i suppose the separation of the cheerleaders and the team is to keep focus .
1468,"yes , especially since they have such short careers as players . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than that of an average nfl player !"
1469,wow ! most nfl players seem to not really make much money at all . good thing i notice a lot attend college or plan to after retiring or forced retirement .
1470,some players say that their major in college was staying eligible . . . it's a pretty bleak future for them if they don't save their money and set up business opportunities while they're famous .
1471,very true . it helps to invest while you have some value and a positive public opinion .
1472,"yes . nice chatting , have a pleasant evening !"
1473,you too !
1474,bye .
1475,i had a good super bowl weekend . do you enjoy the nfl ?
1476,"i didn't catch the game due to lack of cable . i prefer college , but i watch nfl games every now and then ."
1477,it was not a good game but i got to eat bad food ha ha . did you know that in a game there is only an average 11 minutes of actual gameplay ? that's insane when games are that long .
1478,"it really is crazy to think that out of an hour long clock time , 3 hours or so of time the game takes , that there is only that much real action in the game . i think it is interesting that the lifetime earnings of an engineer exceed that of the average football player ."
1479,that is surprising to me . it's much less difficult on your body so i would lean towards going that route . i just recently learned that the nfl has no written rules against female players .
1480,"i don't know if a female has ever played in the nfl , but i heard a few years ago that there was a female referee on one of the crews ."
1481,i don't know of any female players . apparently they would have to meet the league's eligibility requirements and i'm not sure what those are . i don't know if very many women would be large enough .
1482,"i agree , as an athletic woman myself , and knowing some very fit women , none of them would stand a chance being smashed by some of those guys . nor would they want to . you only get one body ."
1483,agreed . a lot of those guys are enormous . as a woman myself i do not appreciate the sexism that the saints treat their cheerleaders with .
1484,"i know ! that is crazy . i am surprised that things like that can even happen today . i have too much respect for myself to ever agree to something so sexist , or stupid . they should be able to eat where they want when they want , regardless of who walks in ."
1485,yes . i can't believe they have to stop eating their food if a player enters and leave . they were there first . what is the reasoning behind that kind of treatment ?
1486,entitlement . i can't think of any other reason . i have known a person who was a bucs cheerleader . as well as a woman who played gaelic football . she was one tough chick .
1487,sounds like it . i have also heard that most cheerleaders make around minimum wage which is also ridiculous . did you know that they use chips in the footballs and players shoulder pads to track every movement ?
1488,"i had heard something about helmets to track movement for concussions , but i just heard about pads recently . if they have all that technology , they i don't know why there are so many questionable calls ."
1489,i was just going to ask that . why don't they use that then instead of just reviews ?
1490,i wonder if it is to just track speed and impact like the sensors in the balls . but even the sensors in the balls can track location .
1491,yes i do not understand it . did you know that in the 1960's pro bowlers made more than pro football players ? that seems crazy now .
1492,"it does , but so does espn winning an emmy for creating the yellow line in the football games . sometimes , things don't make sense , you just have to smile and accept it ."
1493,i'm very glad that they created that . i can't imagine watching a game and tracking it without that line . have you heard of benjarvus greenellis ?
1494,"i know , the line is a life saver , when my mom watched her first high school football game for my brother she wondered why it wasn't there . lol ."
1495,ha ha . it makes watching way easier .
1496,"hello ! here's a shout out to the 212 , ny area code that is . . . , you know why they chose 212 ?"
1497,"actually , no , i don't know much about area codes !"
1498,212 was the easiest number to dial on the old rotary phones !
1499,hah ! that actually makes a lot of sense ! i didn't know that but i did know that the guy who invented the dial telephone was an undertaker !
1500,that's a guy i would not want a call from ! you know the unicef will donate clean water to needy children for every minute you do not use your phone ! sometimes it pays to shut down !
1501,"i had no idea about that ! i will have to look into that . sounds like you know a lot about technology , do you know anything about the nfl ?"
1502,sure ! the average gameplay time in an nfl game is only 11 minutes ! we make a lot of fuss over 11 minutes ! are you a football fan ?
1503,i've just started to understand it a little bit better . that's crazy about the gameplay time ! i just found out that nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players' shoulder pads to record all their moves !
1504,"yeah , and i think new orleans tracks their locations off of the field too ! they do not allow cheerleaders to eat at the same restaurants as the players . who keeps track of that ?"
1505,well that's pretty crazy ! funny story snoop dogg actually wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team . i bet that would be interesting to hear !
1506,awesome ! you what else i love about football ? those yellow lines they project on the tv screens to keep track of the location of yard sticks . espn won an emmy for thinking that one up !
1507,"yeah , that actually helped me a lot when i first started trying to figure out football ! the american flags at stadiums are pretty amazing too . they weigh 1100 pounds !"
1508,"nice ! that's a lot of pomp for those circumstances ! and to think that back in the 1960s , the best bowlers made twice as much money as the top football players ."
1509,"what ? ? that's pretty incredible . did you ever keep up with the whole debacle with urban meyer , the football coach from ohio state ?"
1510,"no , what happened ? did he take his team to the univ of iowa visitors pink locker room and freak out ?"
1511,apparently there were a bunch of domestic violence allegations against him from a former assistant and he didn't handle it very well !
1512,"didn't handle it well ? perhaps , maybe if he had taken lessons from the patriot's benjarvus greenellis . their former running back who never fumle a football his entire nfl career , then he would have handled it better !"
1513,"haha ! that's a pretty amazing stat . well , there's a long line of domestic violence in the nfl that's just kind of been glossed over , so i think there's a pattern there unfortunately ."
1514,"i imagine there was a bit of violence after the historic 2220 loss cumberland suffered at the hands of georgia tech . it had to be off the field , because it doesn't look like cumberland even showed up for the game !"
1515,whoa ! ! i've never heard of that happening before ! do you know what year that happened ?
1516,"1915 . and after 104 years , it is still a record ! nice chatting with you !"
1517,do you watch football a lot ?
1518,"hi , no i don't but i do sometimes . i think it is a great sport !"
1519,i am not too into it myself . perhaps it's because there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay on average in each game .
1520,"very true ! it takes hours to watch lol , i think it's great that the nfl has no written rules against female players . . . ."
1521,"yeah , i wonder if any women will ever meet the requirements . i just wish that people were more willing to watch women's professional sports ."
1522,me too ! i love women's sports ! i think it's crazy that the new orleans saints cheerleaders are never allowed to eat at the same restaurant while any nfl players are dining in !
1523,"yeah , i wonder why that is . it's crazy how glorified football players are . in the 60s , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
1524,"wow , that is interesting , you would never think that could be true ! i find it interesting too that the nfl uses tracking chips in the players shoulder pads to record their moves on the field , i had no idea !"
1525,"yeah , it's interesting how much attention is put into technology in the nfl . did you know espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line ?"
1526,"really ? that's awesome , it is a good invention for sure . i didn't know the nfl merged with the afl way back in 1966 , never knew that !"
1527,football has progressed so much . i don't think we've seen a score as bad as the cumberland football game in 1916 where they lost 0 to 222 .
1528,"wow , that is a high score ! i think it's great that everson griffen spoke up about his mental health issues after he took time off from the vikings and when he came back he spoke openly about it . i think their is such stigma about mental health that was brave of him !"
1529,"yeah , it seems like a lot of nfl players battle with depression , and some of them do not want to speak up about it . steve smith sr . recently talked about battling depression as well . he's one of the toughest wide receivers ."
1530,"i read about that too , more and more people are coming forward about it and i think it is a good thing . also brian dawkins spoke about his depression during his hall of fame induction speech . great men ."
1531,it must be hard to admit what he did .
1532,"he did and even other athletes have come forward about their struggles who play other sports as well , even michael phelps came forward about his struggles ."
1533,"yeah , and joe barksdale not only came forward about suicide consideration but also about the abuse he suffered as a child ."
1534,"wow , that's amazing and brave of him to do , none of that can be easy to discuss but it helps others to seek treatment and we need that in america , nfls brandon marshall has called it the civil rights issue of our era ."
1535,i agree . griffen said that he got treatment and it was the right thing for him . hopefully that makes others brave enough to seek treatment .
1536,i think it already has among these athletes and hopefully this spreads the positivity to others to get help and suicide is not the answer . very good thing these men who are looked at as invincible and strong can even have these issues . . .
1537,"yeah , it is interesting to learn the men behind their tough facades ."
1538,"hi , do you have a favorite football team ?"
1539,"good morning . yes , i do the new england patriots . how about you ?"
1540,same here and i can't believe the running back benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football not even once ! that's no easy feat !
1541,"no , it's not . i can't imagine the pressure he felt ! do you watch any soccer ?"
1542,"yeah that's immense stress ! i do , sometimes , actually i think i only watch the world cup , do you ?"
1543,that's about how much i watch too . i read somewhere that snoop dog wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team . how cool is that ?
1544,"that's pretty neat . i wonder how much game time the average high school football team has , it's got to be more than the nfl which only has 11 minutes of live gameplay !"
1545,"i know that's true and so hard to believe . that last superbowl i watched was about 3 hours long . i tell you , i was shocked to find out those humongous us flags at football stadiums weigh like 1100 pounds and cost about 50 , 000 to make !"
1546,"exactly , with only eleven minutes of game play and yet i devote an entire afternoon or evening to watching the games ! they look very heavy but i didn't realize they were that expensive , has anyone ever tried to steal it ?"
1547,"idk ? probably be very hard to smuggle out weighing that much ! lol i know nfl football is popular , but i had no idea college football was so popular , also . 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams ."
1548,"that's true too ! wow , do you have a favorite college football team ? i wonder if the college cheerleaders are treated like the saints cheerleaders where they are forbidden to eat in the presence of the football players !"
1549,"yes , my alma mater , university of florida gators . go gators ! that's a weird rule they have , makes you wonder what happened to prompt that rule to be put in place ?"
1550,"oh my goodness ! i used to live in jacksonville so i know what you're talking about ! exactly and how come no cheerleader has come out to speak up about it , maybe they want to avoid bad publicity but i think it's doing the exact opposite !"
1551,"me too ! you know as big as nfl and college football are , there is a high school football stadium in texas that seats 18 , 000 and cost 60 million to build ."
1552,"i have never been to that stadium , i have been to a couple longhorns games but i don't think that stadium seats as many people as 18 , 000 ! so it's true , ' everything's bigger in texas ' , even stadiums !"
1553,"apparently , that is true ! on a different note , do you own a car ?"
1554,"yes , i do own a car and drive through the drivethru of restaurants all the time , the drivethru came about from mcdonald's to accommodate soldiers who weren't allowed to get out of their cars while wearing their uniforms , that's a great invention !"
1555,"yeah , that was nice of mcdonald's to do and it has revolutionized the fast food industry for sure . i just moved to ohio , where it is cold and just found out it is illegal to warm my car up in the morning . isn't that crazy ?"
1556,"wow , i didn't know that , so i guess car sellers can't advertise the cars come with remote start function !"
1557,it's useless up here . i can't wait to get back to florida . i freeze every morning !
1558,"lol , i hope you stay warm and i also moved from the south up to the north , i still can't get over having to shovel the driveway every morning !"
1559,"hi , how are you doing today ?"
1560,"i'm doing ok , have you heard of cte ?"
1561,"yeah , it seems awfully scary for football players ."
1562,"yeah , i'm not surprised it reminds me of punch drunk boxers ."
1563,"i've heard that north carolina football coach , larry fedora has questioned the relationship between football and cte and some have backed him , like fox sports . i'm not so sure ."
1564,i saw that . they should question it . the problem is that they have not found a way to diagnose it until after death when they can look at your brain .
1565,"bad way to get a diagnosis . i agree football is a lot safer , nowadays . but , some of those collisions are pretty hard ."
1566,"yeah , it is still brutal if you play . the nfl did concede 2 years ago the connection ."
1567,"fedora and cte is kind of like trump and climate change . lol but , i think there are many sports where your head can get banged pretty hard , besides football ."
1568,what is climate change ?
1569,global warming or climate change lol all the same
1570,did you know the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink ?
1571,high intimidation factor there . do you watch any canadian football ?
1572,i have seen a few games . we just watched the super bowl here on sunday .
1573,"cool , were you rooting for the patriots to win the super bowl again ?"
1574,neither team . the game wasn't that good either . apparently espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line for first downs .
1575,"i agree it was a pretty non descript game , lowest scoring game ever . i didn't know that about espn winning an emmy for creation of the yellow lines for first downs"
1576,"i have to admit , they deserve the emmy for it . it makes the game enjoyable . apparently green ellis never fumbled in his career ."
1577,i agree . that's an impressive feat to never have fumbled a ball his whole career .
1578,"yeah , he must have been a great player . in the 1960s bowlers made twice as much as top football players ."
1579,"that's funny about the bowlers , especially knowing how much money these football stars get paid today . however , the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of a nfl player . plus , you don't have to worry about cte ."
1580,"i'm not surprised , the less known players probably only play a year or so ."
1581,hi ! guess what's allowed in south africa to prevent car jacking ?
1582,i guess you can use flamethrowers on your car to keep someone from car jacking you . how does that work ?
1583,i don't know ! i'd like to see it . cars sure have come a long way since they were first made available to the general public in 1908 .
1584,"the first modern car was made by a german inventor , karl benz ."
1585,yes . i wonder if mercedesbenz is named after him . i hadn't known that cars came from germany . they seem so american .
1586,i believe that they were . i was surprised to find out that the mcdonald's drive thru was designed for soldiers who couldn't get out of their cars in their fatigues .
1587,"yes , it's interesting that they were not allowed to exit their cars while wearing fatigues . i don't think that rule exists anymore . i wonder what the reasoning behind it was ."
1588,"it was in the 1970s , so maybe there was a lot of animosity because of the vietnam war ."
1589,"yes , 1975 . 89 years after the birth of the modern car ."
1590,the old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back . that's why the back of the car is called the trunk .
1591,yes . it makes sense . although the trunk is called a boot in the uk . i hope they didn't make cars with an actual boot on the back .
1592,that would be funny . maybe that's where the saying ' kick him to the curb ' came from .
1593,you never know ! did you know that cars were slower to catch on in europe than america ? i wonder when they caught on in other parts of the world .
1594,i don't know . i think that henry ford made them more accessible with his interchangeable parts .
1595,"yes , the model t ."
1596,the cadillac car brand was also made in detroit and was named after a french explorer .
1597,yes ! the arrival of cars really transformed detroit .
1598,i wonder what led to the city's downfall . there is a lot of media coverage about the downtrodden city of detroit .
1599,"yes , i think that also has to do with changes in the automotive industry . but maybe it will recover . did you know that someone became a pro race car driver by beating 90 , 000 people at gran turismo ?"
1600,"no , i didn't ! i wonder how he even did that ?"
1601,i have no idea ! i'll look it up and give you a call later on . it's been great talking . have a good day !
1602,hey do you ever watch football on tv ?
1603,"hello there , i do , did you watch the super bowl recently ?"
1604,i did watch it with the patriots . they are awesome ! did you know a team in iowa painted the opposing team's lockerroom pink ?
1605,"yeah the patriots won again , very impressive . and i read that , i wonder who gave the final ok for them to do that !"
1606,yeah i don't know . have you ever gone bowling ? the top bowlers used to make twice as much as the top football players
1607,i love going bowling and that shows how far the nfl has come since back then .
1608,bowling is awesome ! i wish i could see the highestever scoring football game . it sounds like a major blowout . 2220 !
1609,that sounds like no defense or even no other team even showed up to play that one !
1610,no i feel bad for cumberland . they got a complete blowout on that game haha . this was back in 1916 though .
1611,"yeah same here , i wonder how many of the fans were still there when the final whistle blew ?"
1612,yeah i would have left almost immediately haha . do you like the patriots though ? benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball and he plays for them
1613,"i don't like them , but think they are one of the best teams ever this past decade or so . and that is incredible !"
1614,i agree ! have you ever seen football on tv and they have the yellow line that makes the first down marker ? that was developed by espn and they won an emmy
1615,"yeah i remember when they first came up with that , it really helped make the game more exciting to watch on tv ."
1616,it definitely makes it a lot easier to follow . did you know that the nfl allows female players technically ? there is no rule against it
1617,"i read that , i think it would be so cool if a female player made a pro roster soon ."
1618,"yeah i think that will happen in our lifetime . what is weird to be is that an average nfl game only last for about 11 minutes , if you're counting life gameplay"
1619,"that is weird , i don't think you notice so much when watching on tv but do when attending live games ."
1620,well the super bowl this year was kind of boring so i kind of noticed haha . did you hear about how the new orleans saints treat their cheerleaders ?
1621,"yeah it wasn't as exciting as last years thats for sure . and i read that , seems a bit outdated to me ."
1622,yeah they shouldn't have to leave if a player comes into a restaurant that they're already sitting at . that is so stupid
1623,hello do you like football ?
1624,"yes , i do , do you ? in 1960 top bowlers made more money than football stars ."
1625,"i do like it but i do not follow it . thats pretty amazing , must have been a good time to be a bowler ."
1626,"yes , 2220 is a defeated game in 1916 !"
1627,that is a very impressive score by georgia tech .
1628,"yes , very . hard to believe there is a football locker room painted pink in iowa !"
1629,"yeah must be a tactic of some sort , i think to soften them up ."
1630,"yes , that would . no written rule against female players ."
1631,"thats interesting , i wonder why we dont see more female football players then"
1632,"i know , didn't know new orleans cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if any nfl player come in ."
1633,that is really rude . maybe the football players should give them a schedule of where they are eating so the cheerleaders can plan accordingly instead of having to leave in mid meal
1634,a better idea ! those tracking chips must help alot !
1635,is amazing what technology contributes to sports
1636,"agree , how would you like your car equipped with a flamethrower ? lol"
1637,"eeek . i dont think i have a need for a flame thrower , maybe if i lived in snow lol"
1638,"ha , ha , ha . yes ! did you know how the name of trunk for the car was from wooden trunks ?"
1639,"i guess that makes sense , they used to tie them to the backs of cars ."
1640,"yes , can't imagine beating 90 , 000 people in a video game ."
1641,people have pretty crazy stats like that on super smash bros .
1642,"really , wow ! did you know cadillac was named after a french explorer ?"
1643,yeah i think he was from detroit .
1644,"yes , love the benz ! great chat ! !"
1645,good talking to you .
1646,do you like football ?
1647,i sure do . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
1648,yes and i wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on the players
1649,good point . in the 60s bowlers made more than football players
1650,yeah i guess it was a more popular sport back then
1651,yeah . do you know the highest score in cllege football ?
1652,yes it was 220 and do you know who was playin ?
1653,yes georgia tech beat cumberland and that was in 1916
1654,"yeah . espn won an emmy once , do you know what for ?"
1655,yes it was for the superimposed yellow line
1656,yeah . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
1657,yes the guy that never fumbled the ball in his career
1658,yes . did you know that football means different things in various countries ?
1659,"yes it can be canadian or australian football , it can be soccer or rugby"
1660,yeah . did you know that women can play in the nfl ?
1661,yes there is no rule against them if they qualify
1662,yes . the game play in a game is actually only 11 minutes
1663,yes and we are glued to the tv for forever it seems
1664,i know . did you know engineers earn more than football players over the lifetime ?
1665,i guess their careers are longer to so maybe that helps
1666,good point there . nice chatting with you
1667,"hi , how are you doing this evening ?"
1668,"very well , just thinking about football . love how its a family kind of sport . rather watching or playing"
1669,that's so true . grandkids love to play and i love watching the nfl games on tv . how about you ?
1670,love watching on tv and paying . years ago espn won an emmy football . love that it gets reconation
1671,"yeah , espn won the emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down , i believe ."
1672,yes which is great . the 32 teams that the nfl consist of make it a fun creative venture to go on for tv productors
1673,did you watch the recent superbowl ?
1674,i did . i saw a commericale about a women who might become the first player in the league . theres no rule there cant be .
1675,"that's true , i'd like to see at least one female player , maybe a pretty one ."
1676,very cool to see her take full advance of those 11 mins a standard game last .
1677,"you know , i never realized an actual game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay . i swear that superbowl was three hours long ."
1678,"all the stop and go makes it look long . only 17 weeks of play , but at times it feels like a full year"
1679,i hear that . just crazy .
1680,"very cray , i love how they have new tech in the sport as well . lost of tracking going on with the embedded shoulder pads"
1681,"yeah , that's pretty cool all the new technology . kind of scary how closely every move is watched on the field ."
1682,dont like how they make so much money much like enginners
1683,"well actually , i read somewhere that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player ."
1684,"yeah they do , doesnt seem like thats how it should work , but ok . they buy all the things they want witl that money . like fast cars"
1685,do you own a car ?
1686,yes cadilac . got that one because its a detrout made family car from the founders of the city na dits my home town
1687,"that's cool , well it's been nice chatting . i need to get to work , i'll talk to you later , friend ."
1688,daniel snyder is a great business man although im not sure if cutting links with his radio stations is the best choice
1689,he seems to be . . . but he can't run an nfl franchise if you ask me !
1690,"yeah i agree , the redskins are an ordinary team , that could change under a better management , maybe he doesnt have the time ,"
1691,lol . . . he's a business man that owns a multimillion dollar franchise . how is that an excuse ?
1692,"well maybe the radio stations take too much of his time and thats why he decided to cut them loose , do you listen to the radio anymore ?"
1693,"i am sure if someone can make a ventriliquist act be succesful on radio , then there is no excuse for him . by the way can you please respond faster ? i don't have all day !"
1694,"ok sorry im just a slow typer , there is a canadian law that says that 40 percent of the music has to be canadian"
1695,yeah i saw that ! i wanna hear solar activity into sound thts cool !
1696,"that does sound cool , jupiter also has storms that are so strong an am frequency can pick them"
1697,"man . . . can you believe that the only president ever to have a phd was woodrow wilson , thats crazy !"
1698,that is crazy ! the only one ? at least we dont have pop stars running the country
1699,and the last president to speak a foreign language was fdr . . . geez !
1700,"we should have better educated presidents , the nuclear football shouldnt be taken lightly , what are your thoughs on trump ?"
1701,he's fine . . . . i think all politicians are fake . . . he's probably the most real one we have had in a long time .
1702,"i see , well he sure is creating controversy in the white house , his guest house is larger than the white house that must be a really big house"
1703,"i a , sure it is . . . it is for the president ! lol see snoop wrote a fight song for his hs ?"
1704,"i didnt catch that one , do you watch the chanel espn ?"
1705,"i used to , but i don't have cable anymore ."
1706,"i see , well espn won an emmy because they created the yellow first down line in football ,"
1707,wow . . . that's awesome ! i love that yellow line ! ! ! see college stadiums are some of the biggest stadiums in the world ?
1708,really ? bigger than pro football stadiums ? they must cost a lot of money to be built
1709,great chat . . . thanks for picking up the pace !
1710,"hi , how are you ?"
1711,do you like the nfl ? i read the other day that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameaplay
1712,i love the nfl . only 11 minutes ? the junpero serra high school jv football team recorded a historically bad season in which they failed to win a game or even score a touchdown yet they never attempted to start their backup quarterback . that backup quarterback they refused to start is 4 time super bowl champion tom brady .
1713,wow that is crazy . i also saw that the nfl has no written rule against female players
1714,"i am watching the pats game now and there's the first female official working the post season , sarah thomas ."
1715,that is interesting . i saw that the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move
1716,"i love chips . hopefully doritos . . . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a junior . the quarterback received his bachelor's degree in two years , and began working on a master's degree , before becoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft ."
1717,wow that sounds great . i just saw that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player . maybe staying in school is good !
1718,"the circular huddle used in todays american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not read his hand signals ."
1719,oh well that is helpful for sure . i saw something strange . the new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining and one walks in they are required to leave
1720,"thats sexist . . . . baker mayfield , quarterback , university of oklahoma , once considered quitting football to pursue fulltime competitive gaming , and claims to be able to beat anyone at the university of oklahoma oneonone in halo 3 ."
1721,ha ha thats funny . i saw that the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football team is painted pink .
1722,speakking of football . . . kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl
1723,wow that is crazy that he is the only one . did you know that the highest score ever in a football game occured in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220
1724,"you gotta pull the qb at 600 , right ?"
1725,i am not certain about that . i saw that the espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the firsts down line for american football games
1726,the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements .
1727,that would be fun to see . i saw that former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career
1728,the law firm . . . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player .
1729,"yes , i think i've heard that before . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football starts"
1730,nice chatting with you . . .
1731,do you ever keep up on brett favre since his retirement ? apparently he auditioned for monday night football
1732,"oh wow didn't nkow that , did you know that the nfl has no rules against female players ?"
1733,i guess it's one of those rules people don't know about since no one has done it . another rule people likely don't know is that cheerleaders for the saints aren
1734,"ya i don't like how they aren't allowed to eat with players , that seems like an outtdated rule and also really dumb"
1735,there might be a legitimate reason for that rule though . all the rules in the nfl make the 11 minutes of live gameplay seem longer than it really is
1736,"ya they definitely stretch taht over 2 hours sometimes , did you know the avg earnings of an engineer is more than that of an nfl playier ?"
1737,"i guess engineers make enough per year and have a longer career . plus , then they're not at risk for injury . still , a 17 week season wouldn't be terrible"
1738,"thats true , thats lots of down time , are you aware of teh tracking chips the nfl uses ?"
1739,i heard there's chips in the footballs and shoulder pads to keep track of speed and all the stats the diehard fans care about . it's pretty cool how that works
1740,"that is cool , hopefully they dont use those on the saints cheerleaders , that would be creepy !"
1741,very true ! that's much more strange than the visitor's locker room for football at the university of iowa being painted pink
1742,"ya that is weird , i wonder if that hurts or helps them , i think that would make me play better haha"
1743,"but still not as good as rb benjarvus greenellis . in all his nfl career , he never fumbled the ball"
1744,"haha true ! crazy how popular bowling was in the 60s , the top bowlers made more than football players !"
1745,i wonder if television has changed that . espn might have had a hand in that like they did with the yellow line they created for the first down
1746,"good piont , can't believe the highest scoring football game was 2220 , thats a blowout !"
1747,"i feel bad for cumberland , but maybe that was a really good season for georgia tech"
1748,"haha true , do you think kellan moore being left handed give him an advantage ?"
1749,"i've heard that left handed qb's throw with a reverse spin , so his teammates would have to get used to that . maybe that's why he's the only lefty in the nfl"
1750,"huh that is interesting , did you hear about how smart alex smith was in school ?"
1751,didn't he start college as a junior and even started on a master's degree before being drafted in the nfl ? that takes a lot of dedication
1752,"oh ya , he could have done a lot even outside of the nfl"
1753,"hi , how are you ? are you a fan of sports ?"
1754,"yea , i like the nfl . , don't think colt mccoy's signing with the redskins was a good move"
1755,"mccoy could have had better , you think ? where else ?"
1756,"i think colt mccoy made out good , he gets to stay with coach jay gruden , i think the redskins could of found someone better or paid less for him"
1757,do the skins have a choice ? will the talent come to the skins ? i figure they gotta compete hard for the best .
1758,well they did have alex smith and were on the way to the playoffs until he got injured and 32 year old mccoy started
1759,thems are the breaks . i figure that someway they can find a combo of rb and qb that will make the yardage to win .
1760,"yea , i guess gruden finds mccoy a great sideline presence"
1761,gruden has lost my friends too much money . i think that he should pay them for all their losses . maybe he should let women play on the team .
1762,"well there is no rule in the nfl against women player , i'm sure they could be place kickers at least"
1763,i bet on the skins they could play other positions . maybe even coach . they could start with placekicker . i would bet on that .
1764,i wonder if gruden was the coach of tom brady's jv footbal team that failed to start him or win a game
1765,that jv coach probably had a personality issue with tom . tom wouldn't eat his wife's strawberry shortcake or something .
1766,probably . did you know alex smith started college as a junior and was working on a masters before being drafted ?
1767,he was a genius ! how many football players could do something like that ? he must have been the smartest qb of his class .
1768,on the other side of the spectrum baker mayfield was considering being a competitive gamer instead of a qb
1769,"i would totally go football . the cash , the women , the fame . no video games ."
1770,"yea , plus the average nfl game only has an average of 11 minutes of gameplay"
1771,"that is insane . you can't get hours like that playing video games . anyway , great chat !"
1772,"you too , i think i'm going to watch some football on espn and enjoy the emmy winning yellow line they invented"
1773,"yes , that line was a breakthrough . like walking on the moon . thanks !"
1774,have a good one
1775,"i think that jon gruden is a sensible loss for the team ,"
1776,what do you mean by sensible loss ? i think john gruden is a huge mistake for the team .
1777,"well i think his a good player , hard to replace , thats what i meant or at least in the raiders team his become an important piece for the coach"
1778,john gruden is an nfl head coach . he's not a player . the 3313 loss to the rams was just the beginning of a miserable season . are you familiar with the nfl ?
1779,"oh i see , i guess im confusing him with a player of the team , what was his name i think it was khalil mack , and i do follow some games what about you ?"
1780,football is one of my favorite sports and i follow all 32 teams . khalil mack was traded to the bears by john gruden for some picks . they definitely felt his absence . i don't know why they didn't just resign him .
1781,maybe he demanded a high salary ? what is your favorite nfl team ?
1782,"i like the giants best , you ? . he did demand a high salary . he's the highest paid defensive player in the nfl . i guess the raiders tied up too much money in carr and gruden ."
1783,"i like the patriots best and yeah thats probably the reason then , too much money but i mean he might be worth it , theres few players with his skills in the league ."
1784,well congratulations on the super bowl . did you know the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of game play ? no wonder my girlfriend gets bored .
1785,"thanks , it was a boring superbowl but good thing the patriots won that cheered me up , and no , i didn't know that so out of the 3 hours a game lasts only 11 minutes are of actual gameplay ? wow"
1786,yeah who knew ? it's quite an interesting game and a big business . they use tracking chips embedded in shoulder pads now to track players . they even have them inside footballs now .
1787,"thats interesting indeed , i wonder how that has changed the game , i bet all kinds of interesting stats are available now because of that data"
1788,espn actually won an emmy for the creation of the yellow line for 1st downs on tv . the power of technology .
1789,"i guess that did change the game forever , i think it's a well deserved award ."
1790,do you follow any other kinds of football besides american football ?
1791,"i like soccer as well , in fact is one of my favorite sports , i also like rugby , what about you ?"
1792,i mostly just an american football guy . interesting that rugby is also considered a type of football
1793,"yeah , rules are completely different but i guess there are some similarities ."
1794,do you remember benjarvus greenellis ? he was a rb on the patriots .
1795,"yeah he never fumbled a ball , incredible player"
1796,are you a fan of the nfl ?
1797,i definitely am . watching the super bowl has become a family tradition . what about you ?
1798,the same i like watching both college and nfl . do you have a favorite team ?
1799,"for college , yes , but i don't have a specific rooting interest when it comes to the nfl . i have a feeling i end up cheering on the american football conference in the super bowl more often than not ."
1800,"true , me too . my favorite college team is the iowa hawkeyes , have you heard of them ?"
1801,"it just so happens i have . i'm a nebraska cornhusker fan , which makes us rivals , even if the last several years haven't gone our way , . i bet when we are the road team it's those pink visitor locker rooms that are doing us in ?"
1802,"yikes lol . i think it does a lot of people in . i like nebraska football too though , probably my second favorite big ten team . the pink is a calming effect ."
1803,hats off to you for being able to like both teams . i guess we were separated by conferences for a long time . at least we never had any 2220 type outcomes on either side . can you imagine what cumberland must have felt in 1916 after georgia tech did that to them ?
1804,"right , i think i would have quit right after the game . or maybe after it was 1000 lol ."
1805,"considering i have never heard of cumberland , maybe that was it for them ? or maybe they lasted until the 1960s when , amazingly enough top bowlers were making twice what football players were ."
1806,"i can't believe that , but i guess it was more popular at that time . i wonder what the pay difference is now ."
1807,"i have no idea . i bet tv had a lot to do with the shift though . think about all the innovation in television have come through sports . i couldn't imagine a game without the first down yellow line and have to remember that isn't actually on the field . i give espn trouble , but all credit to them for that creation which earned them an emmy ."
1808,"i love the yellow line , i used to think it was real when i was younger , glad to know it was digital lol"
1809,maybe espn's tech department is filled with brilliant folks like alex smith who got is degree in two years !
1810,i think they are too . and the engineers do some crazy things . have you heard about the tracking chips they use ?
1811,"i know they invest a ton of money in the game , but i'd love to hear more about these chips ."
1812,"they put them in footballs and shoulder pads to track velocity , speed , and how players move around the field . probably made by the engineers who make more money during their lifetime than the players"
1813,it's a rough sport ! it's crazy to think that just 11 minutes or so of actual game play or hitting over the course of three hours can be so damaging .
1814,wow they take a lot of blows so that is good it is only that long ! it was so nice chatting with you !
1815,you as well ! have a great evening !
1816,"thanks , you as well !"
1817,do you like football ?
1818,i love it . do you know what color is the u of iowa visitor locker room ?
1819,yes it is pink but i a not sure why they chose that color
1820,i wonder if it is supposed to have some effect on them
1821,i wonder too . bowling was more popular than football in the 60s
1822,yes that is why bowlers made way more than them
1823,wow cool . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
1824,"yes that is 2220 , do you know who played ?"
1825,yes it was georgia tech who beat cumberland in 1916
1826,yes . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
1827,yes they won it for the superimposed yellow line
1828,yes . do you know greenellis never fumbled the ball ?
1829,amazing . did you know that women can play in the nfl ?
1830,yes there is no rule that says that they cannot play
1831,yes as long as they qualify they are good to go
1832,yeah . did you know the average live gameplay is only 11 minutes ?
1833,yes and yet we are glued to the tv forever
1834,true . engineers make more than football players over the lifetime
1835,i guess it makes sense since they have longer careers too
1836,true . what do you think of that rule for saints cheerleaders ?
1837,it is sexist and needs to go honestly . nice chat tonight
1838,are you interested in football ?
1839,"i am not . i watch it because i have a son who likes it . also , i think the saints are sexist with how they treat their cheerleaders , and the league should do something about it ."
1840,you're right ! it's something about how cheerleaders and football players can't be in the same restaurant at the same time ? that's crazy ! i wonder what started that !
1841,"i don't know , but it must be frustrating to have to leave in the middle of your meal ."
1842,i was surprised to learn that there is no rule against female players being able to join a team . they just have to meat all the same eligibility points as the men . i think i saw an ad during the superbowl that featured a female player . have you seen it ?
1843,"i have not seen it , i don't watch the superbowl . i know there are a lot of girls who play in high school , many are kickers . i hope a woman decides to try out one day ."
1844,something i just learned about football is that the circular huddle was invented by a deaf player who didn't want the other team to learn his ndigns
1845,that's interesting . especially since it is still in use today . it's funny that the top bowlers used to make more than the top football players .
1846,"i wonder how much that was ! do you think they used to pay football players way less , bowlers more or both ?"
1847,"i don't know , it was back in the 60's . then again , engineers make more than the average player these days"
1848,"i think that's how it should be really . engineers are actually vital at times , football players not so much . did you know that there has only been one left handed quarterback in the nfl ? seems insane given the odds , right ?"
1849,that does seem weird . i guess there is a rb for the patriots who has never fumbled .
1850,"that's interesting , although i'm always suspicious of the patriots after all that stuff about ' deflategate '"
1851,"nothing surprises me anymore . although , with the browns getting obj in trade , i'm thankful baker mayfield didn't quit football to become a pro gamer ."
1852,"i can see the appeal , there's way less risk in gaming than in football and sometimes the money can be pretty similar , right ?"
1853,"some of them make millions at one tournament . i guess he's pretty good at halo 3 , which is a hard game ."
1854,i know about as much about halo as i do about football which isn't much ! haha did you know that espn won an emmy for the creation of the fake yellow line they show on football broadcasts ?
1855,"wow . that must have been a bad year for hollywood , if they won for that . its funny when you realize that tom brady's highschool coach didn't want to play him ."
1856,i wonder what the reason could be for that ? do you think the coach was bad or he didn't like brady personally ?
1857,"maybe he was that bad ? lol , i know i shouldn't say that about a super bowl champ ."
1858,"maybe he just liked the other quarterback better ? haha well it was nice chatting with you , have a nice day !"
1859,ram's become the youngest head coach .
1860,thats really interesting . i wonder if that effects the next years team
1861,which is your favourite sports ?
1862,"i like the 49ers , how about you ? i recently found out that the nfl uses tracking chips ."
1863,super bowl is my favourite . the 2019 nfl season will be the 100th of the national football league .
1864,wow thats great . i prefer baseball than football though . what do you like about football ?
1865,yes . football is the team sports that involves to kicking the ball in various degrees to score a goal .
1866,did you know there was only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
1867,yes . the middle century is the greatest rises for football mainly in england . many group of matches conduct between towns and so many clubs were formed .
1868,that is interesting . the left handed quarterback was named kellan moore .
1869,it is very interesting . english public school played the important role in the development of the football . the only organised the team and they teach the difference between running and carrying .
1870,the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback .
1871,"in modern american football , the quarterback is usually considered the leader of the offensive team ."
1872,"yes , he calls the shots basically ."
1873,baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue fulltime competitive gaming .
1874,"lol well professional gamers dont get injured as much , i say go for it ."
1875,while playing injury is unavoidable . in training only we avoid it .
1876,"yeah thats why i suggest professional gaming , they dont get injured lol"
1877,yes . it makes sense to protect from injury it is very hard to lift the trophy .
1878,do you alex smith ? he took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a jounior .
1879,yeah . it is very nice chatting with you . have a great day .
1880,thanks you as well .
1881,"hi , do you watch football ?"
1882,"a bit but not regularly . i did see the beginning of the superbowl a few weeks ago , but i only have a passing knowledge of football"
1883,i see . do you know who reggie miller is ?
1884,"do you mean the basketball player on the hall of fame ? otherwise , i don't know a reggie miller in football"
1885,"i meant to say alex smith , not sure why i was thinking of reggie ."
1886,i don't know much but i think he was a quarterback . correct me if i'm wrong
1887,yeah he is and he was so good in school he wrapped up a college degree in two years
1888,wow he must be brilliant or a very hard worker . i like quarterbacks since they lead the offense .
1889,"that is true . i think it is a bit of both . he took many ap tests , that's why"
1890,"while i don't know much about alex , i tend to follow players like kellan moore who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl"
1891,"that is amazing , amongst so many players he is the only one"
1892,i mean i know it is inherently harder if you are left handed as a qb
1893,yeah . and baker mayfield once considered quitting to become a competitive gamer
1894,i also think brady johnson is impressive as well since he has even thrown a touchdown pass to himself
1895,that i would like to see . do you know who created the circular huddle ?
1896,"i don't know his name , but i think he was deaf right ? what is his name ?"
1897,yeah he was deaf . his name was paul hubbard
1898,"in any case , i like following players like tom brady , brady jonson , and etc"
1899,they are all great players . did you know women can also play in the nfl
1900,"while there aren't any explicit rules against them , don't the requirements pretty much disqualify them anyway ?"
1901,"i am not too sure , i hope not though . nice chat"
1902,do you like american football ?
1903,i do ! i love football ! ! hard to believe the nfl is made up of 32 teams .
1904,it is harder to believe the average game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay
1905,that is crazy ! i know the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field .
1906,they even put them in the football itself
1907,"oh wow ! that is something . it must be to track ball velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
1908,i hope this data will help reduce the number of injuries to players
1909,"i do too ! did you know that the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80 yard dirt field inside chicago stadium , the then home to the blackhawks ."
1910,what has happened to it now ?
1911,"that i'm not sure of , but i know chicago has changed a lot ."
1912,no doubt . do you like any particular position ?
1913,i would say quarterback is one i know the most about . i know that only two africanamerican quarterbacks have won the super bowl .
1914,i like tom brady . he is still a stellar athlete despite being around 40
1915,he is . i agree . did you know kellan moore is the only lefthanded qb in the nfl ?
1916,yes . he is definitely worth respecting since it is much harder to be left handed as a qb relatively to other sports
1917,"i can't even imagine . superbowl winning quarterback , brad johnson is the only quarterback in history to throw the winning touchdown to himself !"
1918,i wonder how you would even throw the touchdown to yourself ?
1919,it had to be a recovered fumble . did you know that qb russell wilson is still under contract for major league baseball ?
1920,really ?
1921,yes ! he has not played since 2011 .
1922,that is why i was surprised . i should go check it out after this chat . thanks for chatting .
1923,how familiar are you with football and the nfl ?
1924,"i don't follow pro football that much . i was following the saints , home team , when it looks like they were on track for another super bowl , but then got robbed of a victory ."
1925,but you do know that the nfl is among the top 4 major professional sports leagues in north america
1926,"yes , it has a big draw , especially today when a lot of people are glued to their tvs for the super bowl . what do you think of the quarterback match up : patriots brady , age 41 , versus rams mannion , age 26 , ?"
1927,"i think it is an interesting one , but personally rooting for brady . i like the qb position the most since they are the core of the offense . do you like any position in particular ?"
1928,"it is a battle of experience versus youth . i am not set on any position , but it seems like in grade school football being qb was everyone's goal . did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback , paul d . hubbard , so the opposing team could not read his hand signals ?"
1929,"yes , also kellan moor is the only left handed qb in the nfl . i wonder if that is a advantage or disadvantage ."
1930,"i don't know , but doubt it . a left handed hitter is a plus in pro baseball , but i can't see it mattering in football . i tend to follow collegiate' s more , my alma mater lsu . did you know university of iowa painted the visitor's locker room pink ? you got to wonder if it is intimidation , disrespect , good humor , or a combination of those ?"
1931,i tend to follow players more than teams like green ellis who has never fumbled in his entire nfl career
1932,"i did too , louisiana boy terry bradshaw , qb for the steelers . he is one of the reasons the steelers have the most super bowl wins of any nfl team . if you followed the nfl playoffs , you might have noticed that the nfl has a female ref , sarah thomas . do you think they will every have female players ?"
1933,well the nfl doesn't have any written rule against female players
1934,"we will have to wait and see . some of the traditions in football are peculiar , if not humorous . for example , saints chearleaders cannot be in the same resturant with any nfl player , even if they were there first ."
1935,"i agree . however , i think there are some interesting things going on for the nfl , not just on the team level . for instance , they are putting chips into players shoulderpads and footballs to gather data and make better plays"
1936,"i would have liked to have known the g forces the saints receiver took in that ' no call pass interference ' play in the playoff game with the rams . what do you think of the salaries . we know what the stars make , but not the backups and the 2nd string . i wonder how the average salary with the short career span stacks up against other jobs ?"
1937,"well the average lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than that of an nfl , but you have to remember as you pointed out the hour they work respectively ."
1938,"they do earn more per hour playing , but it is a short career , often 10 years or less , while a good engineer would likely get 3540 years of service . you brought up the chips in shoulder pads , but other techs have also changed the game , or at least how it is viewed . did you know espn won an emmy for the tv yellow line showing the first down position ?"
1939,well the yellow line definitely helped many viewers better digest the situation and action on the field
1940,"i agree . with the yellow line , you can really visualize how far they need to move the ball . it also lets the armchair qbs speculate on what plays the real qbs will call . most of these guys are really smart . did you know qb alex smith entered college as a junior and was working on a masters when he entered the nfl draft ?"
1941,"i agree that most of these guys are brilliant . i mean the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay , but so much goes on in those few minutes that the espn won an emmy for helping to break it down and these players have to make the smart decision in fractions of seconds"
1942,"i agree , but they also have coach to qb communications in the qb's helmet these days . what i really don't like is when the qb is a prima donna . they need great backs and receivers . like benjarvus greenellis who never fumbled in his nfl career ."
1943,"i agree . in any case , i enjoy our chat about football . thank you"
1944,same to you . i guess i will go man the grill for our half time feast .
1945,i hope you enjoy your feast . anything on the grill is always delicious .
1946,did you know that theoretically females can play for the nfl ?
1947,i heard about that . i wonder if a woman will ever play in the nfl . i heard there is a really good kicker who is in university right now .
1948,"see that would actually seem to be the most likely position , do they have a whole female football team at that school ? i haven't heard of this ?"
1949,her name is becca longo . i believe she plays on the men's team .
1950,"ah interesting , did you know the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback a while ago ? he used it to block the other team from seeing his hand signals"
1951,"cool . speaking of inventions in the nfl , espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line ."
1952,"that is crazy . it's something we take for granted , kellan moore is the sole lefthanded quarterback in the whole league , i wonder if that is an advantage or not ."
1953,"huh , interesting . i'm not really that into football , perhaps that's because there are only about 11 minutes of live gameplay per game ."
1954,"ya i'm the same way , i don't care at all for football , but i will watch the superbowl because my friend is having a party , what about you ?"
1955,"yes , my friend is having a party too . i'm looking forward to it . i guess the super bowl is held the first sunday in february each year ."
1956,"yes that is true , also wild how the nfl has chips that are put in players clothes to record their stats , i guess that is good . it allows for lots of analytics , almost like a videogame"
1957,"yeah , it's crazy how seriously our culture takes football . i guess that has evolved lately because in the 1960s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
1958,"ya that is wild , definitely the opposite today as far as pay goes , i think its crazy that an engineer will make , on average , more than an nfl player in their lifetime"
1959,"yeah , nfl players really have to be careful about where they spend , and i don't think most of them are ."
1960,"no you're right , and apparently they have to be careful where they eat , for instance with the saints , cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat at the same restaurant as any nfl player , and if an nfl player happens to come in then the cheerleader is required to leave ."
1961,"hmm , that is an odd rule . it also strikes me as odd that the university of iowa painted their visiting locker room pink . that must have been before pink became trendy for men ."
1962,"haha yes that is very odd , i wonder if that increased or decreased their win percentage , i could see teams getting mad and actually performing better"
1963,"haha , that is an interesting thought . some other numbers that i am curious about are the score from the football games in 1916 between georgia tech and cumberland . georgia tech won , 222 to zero . how on earth did that happen ? if only we had footage !"
1964,"yes i would watch that game ! although back in the day , i think i would have left after the score hit 1000 , there's no coming back from that haha"
1965,another thing i find amazing is that ben jarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
1966,"that is crazy , think of his anxiety every time he gets the ball , will this be the day my record is ruined ? haha ,"
1967,hey did you know that the nfl has no rule against having female players ?
1968,i was not aware of that . i'm surprised because they do have some sexist policies . do you know about their rules regarding saints cheerleaders ?
1969,"i haven't heard about that , what are the rules ?"
1970,they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant with players . if a player enters and they are already sitting and eating they have to get up and leave .
1971,oh weird why do you think that is ? it seems very silly to me
1972,i don't know but i find it upsetting . it seems completely unreasonable . did you know that the average gameplay time in a game is 11 minutes ? !
1973,"i didn't know that , are you going to watch the superbowl tomorrow ? it's always several hours long yet like you said theres only 11 mins of gameplay , that's silly !"
1974,i am but i'm just using it as an excuse to eat bad food ha ha . were you aware that players and footballs have tracking chips in them to record their every move ?
1975,"no i didn't know that , i hope they don't adopt that into regular people to watch our every move , that would suck !"
1976,me either . i wonder why they don't use that for plays instead of just reviews ?
1977,"ya that'ss true , also crazy is that the earnings of an engineer over his lifetime is more than the average nfl player , crazy !"
1978,that is shocking to me . i'm sure they leave with way less medical issues also . i was shocked when i learned that in the 60's bowlers made more than football players !
1979,"that is crazy ! i can't believe the highest scoring football game was 2220 , like wouldn't you stop once you got to 1000 haha"
1980,i do not understand how that is even possible . are you familiar with rb benjarvus greenellis ?
1981,"no i'm not , what is he famous for ? i don't watch sports personally"
1982,he never fumbled the football once in his whole career which is astonishing .
1983,"that is crazy i'd give that guy the ball all the time ! i guess alex smith plays quarterback and had a lot of good grades on his ap test , it's kind of like he's wasting his brain talent on football haha"
1984,well he was badly injured and i doubt he comes back so i'm sure his intelligence will get him somewhere else . i believe he was already working on his master's when drafted .
1985,"ah interesting i didn't know that , also i didn't know that espn won an emmy for developing the yellow line that we see in every football game on the first down line"
1986,i can't believe that was so recent . i can't imagine watching a game without that line .
1987,"no , that was definitely a huge improvement i'm glad they won the emmy !"
1988,do you watch football ?
1989,i sure do . did you know that women can play on the nfl ?
1990,"i heard that , i wonder if there is any chance it will happen soon , what do you think"
1991,i have no idea but it is good that if they qualify they have that option to play
1992,i think there may be a kicker in college that has the chance in a couple years . we will have to wait and see . do you have a favorite team ?
1993,i do not but i enjoy watching the games even though there are only 11 minutes of gameplay altogether
1994,"that is so small of an amount . you figure it would be more , the games last like 3 hours lol"
1995,i know we are glued tot he tv for what feels like forever
1996,"for sure lol . i am an iowa hawkeye fan , do you know them ?"
1997,i cannot say that i do for sure . did you know that engineers make more over their lifetime than football players ?
1998,they paint their locker rooms pink for the opposing team . pink has a natural calming look . those engineers probably developed chips that players use in their shoulder pads .
1999,yeah they seem to be collecting lots of info with those chips like velocity and rotation and such
2000,"i agree , i bet they get so much good data from it . did you know in 1960 top bowlers made more money than nfl players"
2001,wow that is mind blowing . i wonder if they they can use that data in any way to make the game safer too
2002,i bet they do . i wish they had chips in the helmets to track blows to the head and what they do . maybe that will be next
2003,"i hope so . do you know that espn won an emmy once and if so , what for ?"
2004,"i never heard about that , what was it for ?"
2005,"it was for the superimposed yellow line , pretty cool"
2006,"wow , that is awesome and it is so helpful . i always thought it was real growing up lol . it was so nice chatting with you !"
2007,same here and hope you have a great one .
2008,"you too , enjoy the rest of your night !"
2009,"hi , do you watch nfl ?"
2010,"hi , how are you ? sometimes ."
2011,did you know women can play too ?
2012,"i think that there could be women at certain positions , like kicker . women would probably draw a lot of interest , increase the tv audience ."
2013,yeah and make it more interesting as a sport . did you know an average game only has 11 minutes of playtime
2014,"on a perminute basis , they make a great wage . did you know that there is only one lefthanded quarterback in the nfl ? kellan moore . i'm surprised . i thought there would have been more , considering the number of lefty pitchers in the mlb ."
2015,yeah exactly . do you know about that weird rule for the new orleans cheerleaders ?
2016,they can't be in the same restaurant as the players . not cool .
2017,"not cool at all . worse , they have to leave if the player walks in mid meal"
2018,"probably not the same for high school football , though . funny story : the junipero serra high school had a season in which they didn't win a game or even score a touchdown . nevertheless , they never started their backup qb , tom brady . and , as a sarcastic comment , we all know what a loser he was ."
2019,my godness their loss . did you know now they put tracking chips on their padding ?
2020,"that makes sense . helps with strategy . the highest score ever in a football game was in 1916 : georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 . what was the spread on that game , i wonder ."
2021,that is a huge difference . did you know espn won an emmy ?
2022,i heard . for that yellow line . hm . probably a weak year for awards .
2023,yeah i think so too . did you know there is a player than never fumbled the football in his career ?
2024,"hard to believe , but i guess it had to happen eventually . in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . still , i wonder how much bowlers made overall . was it that much money ?"
2025,"i do not think so , i just think football players were not paid too much then"
2026,the college game seems to be a bit silly in some ways . the university of iowa tries to use cheesy psychology on the other team . they pained the visitor's locker room completely pink . i wonder whether that works at all . why wouldn't other teams do it as well ?
2027,that is curious . do you know benjarvus greenellis ?
2028,"no , never met the guy ."
2029,he is the only football player to have never fumbled in his career
2030,"well , it's been fun talking with you ! have a great evening ! enjoy the football !"
2031,"hi , how are you today ?"
2032,good morning ! doing well ! are you much of a nlf fan ?
2033,"friend , i tell you i feel like i have had football on the brain for the past couple of weeks ! yes , i love football . how about you ?"
2034,"yes , i enjoy watching a good with friends and beers ! who's your team ?"
2035,"don't hate me , but my favorite team is the new england patriots !"
2036,"no hate at all it's pretty impressive what they've done and look to continue to dominate . by proxy , i follow the cardinals , but don't really consider them my team i just like good games , teams , players"
2037,"that's cool . i find most people feel towards the patriots like they feel towards trump . it's usually strong feelings of hate or love , not much in between . but , tom brady is the goat !"
2038,tb and bilichek are definitely goats ! interesting comparison to trump it's hard not to have an opinion !
2039,"how true . speaking of tom , did you know his high school jv football coach never attempted to play him , even though the team never won a game or even scored a touchdown ?"
2040,that reminds me of the story where michael jordan had a hard time making his hs varsity team some coaches cannot see greatness if it's staring them in the face !
2041,"that's a fact . i bet they feel foolish , now ?"
2042,it's amazing how far the nfl and professional sports in general have come in terms of popularity and revenue . i've heard that pro bowlers used to make more money than football players !
2043,"that's funny , but i hear the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are more than the lifetime earnings of an average nfl player ."
2044,"i think the average career in the nfl is 3 season , for the average player with a league minimum salary , so a life time career as an engineer should make more money !"
2045,"somebody's done their homework and it shows ! anyway , do you realize the nfl only has one left handed quarterback ?"
2046,"interesting who is the lefty qb . is that a system thing , are lefties discouraged from qb at an early age . i don't see what the big deal is baseball pitchers can be both . does it really matter that much in football ?"
2047,"kellan moore and to tell you the truth , i don't why there are not more of them ? i would think it's an advantage ."
2048,"right ! anything to give a different look , roll the other way . once the ball is in the air , whats the difference . i need answers from the nfl !"
2049,me too !
2050,"congrats on another lombardi trophy ! it was a strange playoff season , but great win for the pats great chatting with you today , really appreciate it !"
2051,"thanks , friend . it was nice chatting with you as well . enjoy the rest of your day ."
2052,hello do you like football ?
2053,i do . do you ?
2054,"i like it , i dont watch it too much though ."
2055,i watch all the time . my wife is not happy about my sports adiction though . my favorite team is the bears . do you have a favorite team ?
2056,i like the 49ers . did you know the nfl puts tracking chips on the players and football ?
2057,i put chips in my belly . does that count ?
2058,"lol absolutely ! i had no idea alex smith was so smart , he took so many ap tests , he entered a university as a jounior ."
2059,chicago hosted the first playoff game in 1932 on an 80 yard dirt field .
2060,thats cool . that was a long time ago lol
2061,yeah . did you know there's a 60m stadium in texas ? for high school ?
2062,thats insane . football generates a lot of money in texas though lol not much to do .
2063,i could not imagine being so rich i donated to the construction of a 60m hs football stadium . im just trying to keep my lights on .
2064,lol the struggle is real . i cant believe that the average nfl game has only 11 min of game play .
2065,i feel like there are too many commercials and replays and measurements .
2066,"yeah , too much fluff . and whats with all the time outs and fouls and huddles . football can take so much time ."
2067,maybe that's why i usually drink too much watching the games .
2068,"lol i think thats why we all drink too much , we are waiting to watch the game lol"
2069,at least i am not the only one ! although i am usually the only one watching football and drinking .
2070,did you know the average lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than football players and mlb players ? that is probably not including like sponsorship and extras though right ?
2071,agreed . but i also think the lower end of the spectrum's avg career is like 2 years .
2072,thats cool . its been great chatting with you .
2073,do you like football ?
2074,i love it . do you know what color is the u of iowa visitor locker room ?
2075,yes it is actually all pink but i do not know why
2076,me either . did you know bowlers made more than footballers in the 60s ?
2077,i guess it was a more popular sport back in the day
2078,true . do you know what is the highest score in college football ?
2079,"yes it was 2220 , do you know who played ?"
2080,yes it was georgia tech that beat cumberland in 1916
2081,yeah . did you know that espn won an emmy once ?
2082,yes they won it for the superimposed yellow line
2083,yeah it has made game watching so much easier at home
2084,very true . did you know that women can play in the nfl too ?
2085,yes there is no rule that says they cannot if they qualify
2086,yeah . the gameplay is only 11 minutes anyways
2087,i know and yet we are glued to the tv for hours to an end
2088,i know right ? do you know of that rule for saints cheerleaders ?
2089,yes they cannot eat in the same place as the players
2090,yes and they also have to leave mid meal if they walk in
2091,yeah too bad it is still around . do you like brady ?
2092,i sure do . he was a back up qb when he was in high school
2093,yes and he was never started despite the fact that they were not doing well as a team
2094,their loss really i guess . nice chat today
2095,"hello ! are you much of a football fan ? i don't watch it much tbh , but i do find a lot of facets of it to be pretty interesting . ."
2096,"good afternoon ! football is not my favorite sport , but i do enjoy a good game ."
2097,"get this , iowa's locker room for visitors is painted pink . trying to psyche out the other team , i bet . lol"
2098,that psychology might be a bit antiquated because i think a lot of guys don't feel the same about pink as they used to in the good old days
2099,"that could be true . i'm told that they did an experiment where they put weight lighters in a pink colored gym and found they couldn't lift as much . but , i heard about that in high school , some twenty plus years ago , so things may be different since then ."
2100,"interesting i have heard about the subconscious affect that color has on mood , never paint a kitchen red , but i wasn't sure if that was just an urban myth ?"
2101,"i don't know , i think it varies and could be different from person to person . some people , for example find blue to be smoothing and calming , while others think it makes things feel cold ."
2102,"very true and circling back to the pink locker room , i'm sure the initial intent was to emasculate the opponent and beat them before they take the field"
2103,"you know , neatly enough , there's no rules in the nfl against women being players . so long as they meet the physical requirements , that is ."
2104,"i've heard that , that they didn't think they needed the rule because in the old days the game was much different as were the social norms . i know some females have played in college football recently"
2105,"hey , i say if they can do the physical stuff let them go at it if they want . although , admittedly if i had a daughter playing football i'd worry about her being tackled . . . . some of those guys are huge ."
2106,"totally agree if they have the ability and the desire to play in the nfl , awesome . but i sure as heck wouldn't want my daughters anywhere near that field !"
2107,"even if they were cheerleaders i'd be concerned . believe it or not , cheerleaders have more injuries than any other sport ."
2108,college cheerleaders for sure have a ton of injuries as they do way more of the flipping and gymnastics . i've seen nfl cheerleaders up close and they basically just stand there for 80 percent of the game . . . .
2109,"some teams have some pretty strict rules about cheerleaders , especially in terms of their interaction with the players ."
2110,"i bet back in the day the distraction proved to be big enough of a problem that those nonfraternization rules were implemented . today , it's so much of a business that i doubt it would be much of an issue"
2111,"well , new orleans saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as one of the players . if a player enters and they're already eating , they have to leave . how nutty is that ?"
2112,"i bet if the cheerleaders had a union like the players do , they could get that rule thrown out !"
2113,"maybe i dunno . . . here's another weird tidbit . . . for as long as nfl games are , there's only about eleven minutes of live gameplay . can you believe it ?"
2114,"i did know that , because the nfl network replays games during the week and they are able to trim them down to about a 30 min segment , with commercials , it is amazing how little action there is in an ' action packed ' game !"
2115,"guess all the set ups , coaches talking , huddles , etc , etc , take up way more time than you'd think !"
2116,"and the incessant tv timeouts ! ! ! after a bad game , i feel like i just wasted 3 hours of my life and it was only really 11 min ! ? ! ? !"
2117,"yeah , it's crazy . did you know they have high tech chips put in the players shoulder pads ? keeps track of where they are and whatnot ."
2118,i wish they would put those chips in the ball so they could tell when it crosses the endzone or out of bounds !
2119,"weell . . supposedly they have one in the ball that tracks it's speed , rotation and location . i don't know why they don't use that instead of relying on the referees . , guess it's just tradition or something . . . ,"
2120,"you're probably right tradition over technology ! hey , in case this ends abruptly it's been great chatting with you !"
2121,"are you an nfl fan ? if you don't know , there is a 17 week regular season ."
2122,"hey ! well , i follow games , but i wouldn't say i'm really fan . how about you ?"
2123,did you know a female can play in the nfl because there is no official rule against it .
2124,"no , it's absolutely surprise for me"
2125,"also , in a whole nfl game , there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay ."
2126,"friend of mine told me that . yes , it's fact"
2127,that is crazy . the new orleans saints have a rule were there cheerleaders can't eat at the same restaurant as the players .
2128,"it looks like old tradition , which doesn't make any sense ."
2129,"and if the cheerleaders are already there when the players come in , the cheerleaders have to leave ."
2130,don't you think this rule is terrible ? what if they were eating ?
2131,that sounds sexist to me . some more football facts you may not know is that the university of iowa has a completely pink visitors locker room .
2132,it's very funny . they want to shock enemies . anyway it's funny
2133,something i could not believe was that the top bowlers made twice as much as top football players in 1960 .
2134,me too actually . did you know that the highest score ever in a football game was 2220 in 1916 ?
2135,"no , that is a lot of points . i did know that rb benjarvus greenellis , who played for the patriots never had a fumble ."
2136,me too . it's even difficult to guess . also i'm surprised that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than average lifetime earnings of an nfl player . i was sure they make a lot .
2137,i just can't believe that . did you know tom brady was a backup quarterback in high school .
2138,i guess my dad knows it . he knows about tom brady quite a lot .
2139,"he was either bad or the coach was an idiot . but even though his team was having a historically bad season , he never got a chance to start ."
2140,i agreed . he didn't show his best . anyway it is sport . you never know . . .
2141,i also know that there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl . it is kellan moore .
2142,"yes , i know . i don't know a lot of such facts , but somehow i've heard about it ."
2143,"well , have a great day ."
2144,"thanks , my friend ! have a good one !"
2145,happy new year .
2146,i didn't find this article very interesting . how about you ?
2147,yeah i'm not very interested in football so it took me a while to get through . i did think it was a little crazy that the nfl uses tracking chips on their players and equipment though
2148,yeah some of the facts caught me of guard too . like that fact that there is no written rule against female players .
2149,right ? i would love to see a female in the nfl . i also couldn't believe that the american flags they use weight 1100 like i know they're big but its hard to imagine a flag weighing that much haha
2150,i do not understand the rule about new orleans saint players and cheerleaders .
2151,"i don't remember reading about that just now in my article , but it sounds familiar . it has something to do with them not being able to hang out right ? like they can't go to the same parties or other places at the same time , yeah ?"
2152,"yeah even if a cheerleader is eating at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in to dine at the restaurant , any nfl player , they are required to leave . wow"
2153,"is it always the cheerleaders that have to leave ? like if she's already there and a player walks in , she has to be the one to go ? thats really strange"
2154,yeah that's what it says . no fraternization at all .
2155,"that's . . . really weird . speaking of weird , i guess there is a high school stadium in texas that cost 60 million to build and seats 18 , 000 people who knew people cared that much about high school football ? !"
2156,"oh sure , in some parts of texas there is nothing else to do for a hundred miles at least . for some small towns , high school football is all the excitement they get ."
2157,"yeah that makes sense . i guess if i had nothing else , i might have to turn to football for entertainment haha . did you read about matt patricia ? apparently he was a rocket scientists before his nfl coaching job ."
2158,i think we have different facts . but that is interesting . one of mine is that the university of iowa's visitor locker room for football is painted completely pink . hilarious !
2159,"hah that is actually pretty funny ! i wonder if its effective in throwing off the opposing team a bit . i read that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl not the most interesting fact , but kind of surprising . i didn't think being lefthanded was that uncommon . i wonder how many left handed ones they've had overall ?"
2160,that is interesting . i thought there would have been more as well . just like in baseball .
2161,"is being lefthanded unusual in baseball too ? or are you saying its not uncommon ? speaking of baseball , i guess russell wilson is still under an mlb contract ? i didn't know that was possible !"
2162,"lol all these crazy fun facts . i was saying it is way more common in baseball , to see both left and right handed pitchers ."
2163,right that's what i thought ! i feel like these are good for potential trivia questions haha like i read that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school team . i wonder what that sounds like haha
2164,yeah and that the highest football score ever was in 1916 222 0
2165,222 ? thats insane . i wonder how long that game lasted ?
2166,right ?
2167,much of a football fan ? interested in redskins or buccaneers ?
2168,only if they have a female player on their teams .
2169,"we may be out of luck on that one . i lived in dc for a number of year , so some would thin i have an interest in dc winning ."
2170,"i'm a new orleans native , and won't support the saints , until they get rid of that archaic rule regarding cheerleaders being in the same restaurants as the players ."
2171,"agreed , i really don't like the whole cheerleader thing . i have a young daughter and would hate for her to want to be a cheerleader ."
2172,"mine doesn't cheer , as i don't like the culture . my son's girlfriend plays football for their school , she's their kicker . i'm surprised no nfl team has a woman kicker ."
2173,"well there is no rule against it . i'm sure there would be a lot of fuss in the media for a few weeks , and then once she played it would be forgotten . i know in uk soccer they have women referees , once they started doing it everyone got over it ."
2174,do they also have tracking chips in their balls over there or
2175,"probably , i know most big sports leagues track just about everything the players do , always looking for that edge ."
2176,"thats insane . i think it's invasive , and wouldn't want a tracker in my shoulder pads , if i were a player ."
2177,"i think the compensation football players get now would allow me to get over it . although i think we assume most players are set for life after a career , it might not be true ."
2178,"maybe . i still can't believe espn won an emmy for that superimposed yellow line . must have been a bad year , if they won for that ."
2179,"i suppose if you are really into the game it matters to you , remembering a number in your head can be difficult . i remember my son wondering how the line moved on the pitch when he was really young ."
2180,it's interesting that baker mayfield thought about becoming a pro gamer . i wonder how that would have worked out for him .
2181,"i've been hearing more and more about pro gaming , apparently there is money in in now . colleges have started offering scholarships for esport league players . not sure how i feel about that , i guess it's safer than football ."
2182,"he is a halo 3 guru , i guess . if they are at that level , then they probably make more than what a scholarship is worth . i know some of the pros make millions ."
2183,i wonder how long a pro gamer career lasts ? if it's not longer than a football players they will run into the same issue where a regular career pays more than a short sports career .
2184,"i suppose as long as their reflexes hold out . it's funny , pro bowlers used to make more than pro football players ."
2185,"i think a pro bowling career might last a little longer , doesn't seem much chance of injury . espn needs to come up with an innovation for bowling , its very repetitive ."
2186,the same could be said for footall .
2187,"guess you have a point , i still don't understand how you can turn 11 minutes of play into three hours of tv . it's been good chatting to you ."
2188,"i don't understand that either , any more than i understand why there is only one left handed quarterback . it's been fun , have a good one ."
2189,"have a good day , goodbye ."
2190,hello ! how are you today ?
2191,hello ! i hope you like football ! because i am ready to talk about football ! do you ilke football ?
2192,i am so ready to talk about football lol . i love it it ! do you like nfl or college more ?
2193,"i love any type of football ! association football , known as soccer in some countries , , australian rules , rugby football ! but the good ol' national football league , nfl , might be my favorite !"
2194,i can't believe there are so many different sports called football though . who is your favorite nfl team ?
2195,"with 32 teams , it's hard to pick ! who do you like ?"
2196,i'm a vikings fan but i like watching the broncos since i live in colorado springs . can you believe there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
2197,"wow , just 11 minutes ? is that it ? i know the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in shoulders to track players moves . that's a lot of work for just 11 minutes of live play !"
2198,it makes the data analysts job very easy i'm sure haha . espn even won an emmy for that yellow first down line !
2199,they sure are an innovative league ! did you know there is even a rocket scientist coaching in the nfl ? !
2200,isn't that matt patricia ?
2201,"it is ! he was an aeronautical engineer before coaching in the nfl ! his school , rpi , even had the words ' sin ' , ' cosine ' , and ' tangent ' in their fight song !"
2202,oh wow ! i'm not smart enough to even go to those football games ! it would be interesting to see that 2220 football game in 1916 though !
2203,"yeah ! i do like the entertainment thought . you know , we talked about fight songs a minute ago ; did you know that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football game ! ?"
2204,i bet that jumped to the billboard charts after being written huh ? lol that is funny !
2205,"i thought so too ! you know , even high school football is really popular . there is a high school football stadium in allen , texas with 18 , 000 seats !"
2206,"didn't it cost 60 million dollars ? that is insane , i bet the teachers are still underpaid there too !"
2207,"yup ! that's the one ! so much money is spent on football ! did you know that those humongous american flags at football stadiums cost 50 , 000 to make ! ?"
2208,"it is cool to see but that is a lot of money ! i hope it goes to a good cause ! anyways , great chat have an awesome day !"
2209,"indeed ! and those flags weigh 1 , 100 pounds ! go big or go home , as they say ! good bye !"
2210,that's right ! take care !
2211,do you like to talk about football ?
2212,"hi , yes , sports in general ! ! and of course about football !"
2213,nice ! the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink ! lol
2214,hahaha that is pretty funny and not intimidating at all !
2215,i know . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars !
2216,wow that shocked me . . . nothing like that today did you know three football coaches are the highest paid employees of the us defense department !
2217,that's incredible ! the highest score ever in a football game is when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 !
2218,wow what a score ! ! did you know there is a fight song from a school written by snoop dog !
2219,i didn't . that's neat ! espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line on tv .
2220,"i think that is cool ! technology has allowed for a way more exciting game , like the tracking chips !"
2221,i agree ! baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career .
2222,"wow , i wouldn't want a change like that . . did you know there are many other types of football like soccer , rugby gaelic football ! !"
2223,yes i've seen them . i had a friend that was in rugby club years and years ago .
2224,"cool i love soccer , follow the fc barcelona . . . but do not know anything about australian football !"
2225,that's funny . that same friend was from england and was big on manchester united . the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay . seems crazy to pay all that money for a ticket when looked at from that perspective .
2226,"seems like it but the reality is that the whole show if worth it and with the tracking chip you get info like the ball speed , the velocity and that adds to the average 11 minute hahaha"
2227,lol the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player .
2228,oh wow . but i think is way more fun to play football . . . but i think the engineer has to work many more years . . have you seen the super super big flags at the football stadiums
2229,i have seen them ! those flags are huge !
2230,"they weight more that 1000 pounds and cost about 50 , 000 wow !"
2231,holy smokes ! i had no idea they weighed and cost that much . thanks for chatting !
2232,hi . do you watch football at all these days ?
2233,yes i still watch the nfl of another season is over . it was an exciting 17 weeks . you ?
2234,i do watch the nfl and i do agree with you it was an exciting season and especially when my new england patriots won the super bowl ! ! !
2235,oh congratulations . another one under your guys belt . speaking of the playoffs the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 !
2236,i didn't know this . do you recall by any chance what were the teams playing that game at that year ?
2237,i believe it was in chicago stadium on an 80 yard long dirt field !
2238,oh wow ! ! ! i didn't know this . do you know what was the highest score ever in a football game ?
2239,"yes and the field was home to the chicago blackhawks at the time . no , what was the highest score ever ?"
2240,"i think you answered the wrong question . what was the highest score ever recorded in a football game , do you know ?"
2241,sorry i was just telling you more about the field whether first playoff games held . i don't know the highest score ever . what was it ?
2242,that's okay . it was a game between georgia tech crushing cumberland 2220 in 1916 .
2243,holy cow how does that even happen ? i bet matt patricia would never let that happen . he is the only rocket scientist coaching in the nfl .
2244,yes i heard that matt patricia is a rocket scientist a while back in my local news and when he was our defensive coordinator under bill belichick .
2245,"oh wow . he graduated from a school whose fight song includes sin , cosine , and tangent lol ."
2246,i didn't know this . that is very interesting . matt patricia is a really smart guy and i think he will be great as a lions head coach .
2247,"yes i agree with you . do you like watching high school football ? it is huge in texas , they have a stadium that cost 60 million to build ."
2248,i don't really watch high school football these day but that is a lot of money to build a high school stadium .
2249,"yes it is . it seats 18 , 000 people ."
2250,nice . did you know that alex smith received his bachelor's degree in just a couple of years ?
2251,"that is amazing he sounds so smart . speaking of quarterbacks , russel wilson is still under a majorleague baseball contract . it was nice speaking with you today ."
2252,i didn't know this about russel wilson . it was fantastic chatting with you today as well . i hope you have a great day ! ! !
2253,you too ! have a good one !
2254,"i don't know much about football , but apparently adrian peterson is a new star on the redskins team ."
2255,"he seems to have done well , alex smith struggled in that game . he is typically on point , to what i know ,"
2256,"it's pretty amazing how he got a shot , seeing as he wasn't in the training camp . it sounds like he has a lot of stamina ."
2257,he is ready and willing to do what ever gruden will give him . definitely a hard worker .
2258,"i think nfl players make a lot of money these days , so i bet he's glad to be on a team again . however , i didn't know that bowlers in 1960 made more than football stars ."
2259,"that is kinda crazy , i wonder how much that pay was , and what the gap is today ."
2260,"it's probably not as much as it was in 1960 twice as much , wow . that makes me want to take up bowling ! i think the game peterson played wasn't a very clear win , only a few scores . there was one game in 1916 where the final score was 2220 . i didn't know the game could go that high !"
2261,"neither did i . that is a pretty large gap . in most games there is only 11 minutes of live game play anyway , that game must have had a lot more ."
2262,"yeah . i didn't realize it was only around 11 minutes of actual play . thinking about it , though , i guess they time all the huddles and positioning . i didn't know the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback . i thought that began with the game so they could all hear each other ."
2263,"it is amazing that what they come up with , the huddle has become iconic ."
2264,yes it has become iconic . this peterson is called a running back . is that the guy who tries to throw it to the quarterback or tries to catch the ball ?
2265,he is the guy that the quarterback hands the ball off to .
2266,"oh ok . i knew the quarterback was an important guy for offense , but peterson's position sounded important too . i think football players have a lot of pressure to do well . apparently the nfl uses chips to track lots of stats about them . i wonder if that affects their pay ."
2267,"im not sure , but i know they do use the data from the chips to make play safer for them and make their pads better ."
2268,that's a good thing . i think they can easily get injured without pads . i think padding is more like the american kind of football . i've seen some clips of rugby played without pads . that looks pretty rough .
2269,"yeah , gaelic football is the same way , im not sure how it works but it isnt for the weak ."
2270,"i personally like the european type of football , also called soccer . i like the strategy and skill . i've been to an international soccer game before , it was really awesome to watch ."
2271,me too . i always played growing up . i loved watching the world cup this past summer .
2272,"i haven't watched sports lately . it's funny how things change , like how tom brady became a super bowl champ , but in high school they didn't even give him a chance ."
2273,"i know , i bet they feel a little stupid now seeing what he has become ."
2274,"yes i think so . i wonder if peterson wants to win such an award before he has to retire . hopefully the redskins will do better than the game against the broncos , so he has a chance to prove himself ."
2275,"i know he has become a more dominant force as he gains experience . anyway , nice chat ! have a good night ."
2276,i was just reading about the nfl . are you a football fan ?
2277,"i love football , go detroit lions ! ! what about you ?"
2278,"i am a vikings fan , big time . i was reading about nick foles' up and down career . the eagles sure killed my vikes in the playoffs last year !"
2279,"it will be interesting to see how foles does from here on out , must be irritating for eagles fans never knowing !"
2280,"yes . i was surprised that the patriots lost the super bowl last year . did you know that when tb was a qb in high school as a backup , they never played him on the jv team when they were having a really bad season . funny !"
2281,"that is funny , i don't care for patriots but can't help but like brady , a michigan man go blue ! !"
2282,exactly . you cannot fault his tremendous commitment to the game . i think a bears or patriots superbowl would be fun again .
2283,"i've read that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's football team in high school , that could be interesting !"
2284,yes . that is probably a pretty vivid and inspiring song !
2285,i was also interested to read about the lions' coach is a rocket scientist ! have you seen him during a game ? so rough looking
2286,"matt patricia ? he is super smart ! so is alex smith , one of my favorite qb's . he got a bachelor's degree in 2 years and a master's soon after ."
2287,"that is good to hear , some of those nfl players don't seem too intelligent , and can be so cocky and"
2288,"i agree . here's a piece of football trivia . the huddle was created because of a deaf qb , so that the other team could not read his hand signals . interesting . . ."
2289,oh how cool is that ! also interesting is that they embed chips in the should pads to track the players every move
2290,i had heard that somewhere . plus all of the wonderful new technology in the helmets to help with the concussion problem .
2291,yes that is a scary thing !
2292,"seems to be getting worse , despite the tech advances . players must be stronger , bigger and faster ?"
2293,"definitely , so many people can be so competitive it gets scary ."
2294,yes . hey do you know the highest score ever in a football game ? you'll never guess !
2295,"i have no idea , but would guess maybe 77 ?"
2296,"good try ! in 1916 , it was 2220 . georgia tech defeated cumberland . wow !"
2297,"holy cow that is a huge score , and cumberland didn't even make it on the board !"
2298,awful ! it was great chatting with you . thanks . go lions and vikes !
2299,are you a football fan ? do you have a favorite team ?
2300,i like the steelers . how bout you .
2301,i'm a steelers fan too ! i live right on the ohio or pa line . did you know that there is only 1 left handed qb in the nfl kellan moore .
2302,i did know that . you would think there would be more .
2303,i know . what do you think of the nfl using tracking chips in the players shoulders and in the footballs ?
2304,i think its an amazing technology . the things they can do these days .
2305,i know . i just wonder though what exactly those chips do . like . . . could they read where other chips are on the field ? . . and if so . . . could a chip in the shoulder pads of a wide receiver be programmed to the chip that's in the football making the football come to the receiver's chip location ?
2306,that's interesting to think about . i bet belichek has already checked into that .
2307,hahaha an average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay . crazy when they make it stretch out to over 3 hours .
2308,i know right . they get all that money for 11 minutes worth of entertainment .
2309,it pays to be an engineer as their lifetime earnings are higher than that of the lifetime earnings of an average nfl or mlb player .
2310,yeah but i think it would be a lot more fun to play football for a living .
2311,i'm with you there ! lol in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars .
2312,i think the players union has rectified that situation .
2313,yes ! lol i wonder why the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink ? probably to mess with the team . lol
2314,to mess with the visiting team . do you think it worked .
2315,i don't think so . lol how about the highest scoring game ever when georgia tech beat cumberland in 1916 by a score of 2220 !
2316,they were just rubbing it in that last 200 points huh .
2317,lol poor cumberland . did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf qb so the other team couldn't steal his hand signals ?
2318,yeah and the huddle has become so engrained into football . its hard to think of the game without it .
2319,i know right ? it was fun chatting with you !
2320,hi . do you like the nfl and the ravens ?
2321,i like the nfl . not so much the ravens .
2322,"same here . i guess lamar jackson is back , or has been back , . . . so many injuries in the nfl ."
2323,im a steelers fan and we play them twice a year . i promise you im not worried about lamar jackson .
2324,ha . i see . . . i'm a chiefs fan and i'm not losing any sleep . i think the ravens would do better if they could the players out of jail . i didn't know the saints had an 81 record .
2325,jackson can run but he cant throw at all . you all got a pretty good qb up there in kc tho
2326,"yeah , mahomes is a great surprise . if he stays healthy , he'll give brady a run for his money , career statswise ."
2327,brady will be out in the next few years . i would say staying healthy and not falling off like a lot of guys do after one good year is his main concerns .
2328,"yes , i agree . . . maybe he'll be like luck and avoid those sacks . hope so , i'd hate to see him go and he's so young ."
2329,to be honest the chiefs scare me more than the patriots do at this point .
2330,"yeah , i was surprise to see that rams come out on top . i think the pats are going downhill ."
2331,i sure hope so . im sick of them . lol . did you know that there is a rocket scientist coaching in the nfl .
2332,i did not . is he doing well ? i can't believe that or that there is only 11 average minutes of gameplay in an nfl game .
2333,his name is mat patrecia . im not sure who he coaches .
2334,i'm not sure those are transferable talents . . . nor do i think painting a visitors locker room pink is going to do anything at the u . of iowa .
2335,yeah i dont see that doing much . it would make a good team laugh and who cares what it does to a bad team . lol .
2336,i played in hs and on away games we used the girls locker rooms . it had no effect although i did break a barry manilow album after a loss . i regret that . . . we did have a circular huddle thank to a deaf qb of yesteryear .
2337,that huddle has grown into a major part of the game .
2338,yeah . . . i don't remember alex smith being so smart or being a 1st round draft pick . . .
2339,i think he was drafted by the patriots wasnt he . i didnt think he was a first rounder either .
2340,this article i read says he was a first rounder in 2005 doesn't say to whom . thanks for the chat and good luck to the steelers .
2341,have a good one .
2342,hello are you familiar with football ?
2343,"yes , i do . i'm mad that new orlean saitns cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player . they have to leave if a player comes in to the same restaurant . it's discrimination ."
2344,i agree such old fashion rules are a shame . at least the nfl has no written rule against female players
2345,that's good . when do you think we will see female players ?
2346,"that i am not sure . even though an average game only has 11 minutes of real gameplay , football is still among the most dangerous sports so the requirements are quite up there as well"
2347,"i think you are right . apparently , nfl uses tracking chips to keep track players' every move on the field ."
2348,it must be for more data . it is hard to catch all the action in those few minutes . that why espn won an emmy for the yellow first down line because it helps digest the information much easily
2349,i'm sure coaches use the data from these chips to make various strategy in addition to watching video replays .
2350,i wonder if the nfl provides the data to individual coaches
2351,i don't know . thank you for telling me that espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow first down line . it's an interesting fact .
2352,"do you follow teams , positions , or players ?"
2353,i used to like 49ers since i lived in sf for 30 years but now i follow the patriots .
2354,i used to follow green ellis on the patriots since he still has never fumbled in his entire career
2355,"it was amazing that ellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career , how about brady ?"
2356,"well he is better known as an amazing quarterback , having won 4 super bowls . he probably isn't in a position to fumble balls , but he sure can throw"
2357,do you know that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
2358,yes . it is definitely impressive since being left handed is more a disadvantage than advantage in football unlike in other sports
2359,do you think brady is the best qb in the entire history of nfl ?
2360,"given his performance , despite not being given the chance in highschool , i think he probably is the best qb in history"
2361,you are probably right . no one has won many superbowl championship like he did . 5 times ?
2362,"something like that . anyway , i enjoyed our pleasant chat ."
2363,do you watch football ?
2364,yes . i watch it all season long and even have been watching the alliance league .
2365,i watch it too . did you know kellan moore is the only lefty ?
2366,i didn't know that . come to think of it i can't recall any lefties . former patriots running back benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball once during his career . impressive .
2367,"interesting , was he the best running back then ?"
2368,i would say that would go to jim brown . espn won an emmy award of creating the superimposed first down line . nice .
2369,that is probably worth it . that line is super cool .
2370,i agree . in the 1960s top bowlers made two times as much as the top football stars of that era .
2371,"wow ! that is pretty cool , gives me hope then !"
2372,lol do you know what the highest score ever was for a football game at the college level ?
2373,"no , what was it ?"
2374,2220 ! georgia tech beat cumberland in 1916 .
2375,wow ! that is a lot . did you know that university of iowa paints their guest locker room pink ?
2376,lol that's funny ! they must do that to get in the heads of who they are playing .
2377,"i think so , but honestly you have to wonder if it just makes the other team angry ."
2378,i don't think they probably really care . do you know who alex smith is ?
2379,"not really , is he a football player ?"
2380,yes . he's a qb . he was the first pick in the 2005 draft by the 49er's . what's impressive about him is that he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 2 years !
2381,interesting . is he left handed too ?
2382,no . he's a righty . i'm surprised that there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay per an average nfl game .
2383,"that figures , every time i watch a game it is people standing around on the sidelines ."
2384,"hello , do you know much about quarterbacks ?"
2385,i do ! i know that kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl .
2386,that's interesting . what about vick ?
2387,"he's retired . but , he's coaching one of the teams in the new american alliance of football league . do you have a favorite qb ? mine is baker mayfield ."
2388,i did not know that . i would say mahomes is my favorite right now . i also like andy dalton .
2389,mahomes is good and i like dalton . be curious to see what mahomes does next year . see if teams can adjust to him . baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career . yikes ! that sounds too risky .
2390,i agree . did you know alex smith took so many ap classes in high school that he was a junior when he entered college ?
2391,i didn't know that . that's pretty impressive ! the circular huddle was created by a deaf qb named paul hubbard so the other team could not read his hand signals .
2392,that's pretty interesting . i had no idea . do you like the nfl in general ?
2393,i do . i've been an nfl fan my whole life . probably more so though before big money changed the game .
2394,me too . did you know the nfl has no written rule against females playing in the league ?
2395,i did know that . i wonder if we'll see one soon . maybe a kicker ?
2396,i bet it will be a kicker too .
2397,did you know that there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game ?
2398,"i did not know that , but that is pretty amazing . i would have never guessed that ."
2399,short time considering they stretch out a game to 3 hours . lol what do you think of the tracking chips they put in the players shoulder pads and footballs to track data ?
2400,"i agree . yes , i heard they do that to track rotation , ball speed , location , and velocity ."
2401,i've wondered if they could be attracted to other chips ? like would the chips in the balls be programmed to be attracted to the chips in the wide receivers shoulder pads ?
2402,"i'm not too sure how that works , but curious to know ."
2403,the highest scoring football game ever was 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland in 1916 . what a blowout !
2404,it was good talking to you !
2405,"hi , do you like the nfl ?"
2406,it's pretty entertaining . can you believe the very first playoff game was in 1932 ?
2407,that was a long time ago ! like when georgia tech beat cumberland !
2408,"yeah , on an 80yard long dirt field that was the home of an nhl team !"
2409,"wait , what ? what was the field ? the cumberland game ? tell me more !"
2410,the field of the first playoff game in 1932 was actually on a dirt field inside the chicago stadium which was where the blackhawks played their games at the time .
2411,that's crazy ! im in chicago and i did not know that ! i did love the old stadium though !
2412,nice . did you know there was a football coach in the nfl who is also literally a rocket scientist ?
2413,i did ! but i am also a huge football junkie . matt patricia ! he is the lions head coach .
2414,that's cool . the lions have a pretty good quarterback .
2415,"i agree . although he is long in the tooth . as a bears fan , i hope they do poorly !"
2416,i can't believe there is only one lefthanded quarterback in the league .
2417,is it byran leftwich ?
2418,"no , it's kellan moore ."
2419,"wow , i thought it was byron leftwich . he was good too ! do you have a favorite nfl team ?"
2420,"i don't , i'm more of a baseball fan . though russell wilson plays both !"
2421,i love baseball too . i am a cubs fam though . big fan . watching mlb network now !
2422,"cool . yeah , wilson is technically still under an mlb contract even though he hasn't played since 2011 ."
2423,he has been to a few spring trainings though . rnagers an yankees .
2424,"yeah , the rangers traded him to the yankees last year ."
2425,nice chatting with you !
2426,"you , too ! have a good one !"
2427,"hello , did you happen to watch the superbowl yesterday ?"
2428,yes i did . did you ?
2429,"i did , i thought it was a good game , both teams had strong defenses i think tom brady did a good job even though he finished as the third most valuable qb"
2430,both defenses did play good . who were the two qbs more valuable than tom brady ?
2431,im not sure but if had to gues i would say aaron roders and drew brees .
2432,i see . are you talking about the super bowl or the entire season ?
2433,"im talking about the entire season , i think he might go up to second or first with his performance last night , he threw a great pass for the only touchdown"
2434,but there were not passing touch downs last night .
2435,"i know , but the pass that was almost a touchdown , thats the one im refering to ."
2436,i see . yes that was a very good pass . not many qbs could make that throw .
2437,"yeah , too bad it wasnt a touchdown though , so close just a few more yards , so what is your favorite nfl team ?"
2438,the dallas cowboys . i've been watching them since i was a little kid . how about you ?
2439,"my favorite team is the patriots so i had a pretty good time last night , how did the cowboys do this season ?"
2440,that's awesome . it's always nice when your favorite team wins the championship . the cowboys won their division but lost in the 2nd round of the playoffs this year .
2441,"thats too bad , maybe next year they will make it , you know the saints have this unfair rule and if a cheerleader is at a restaurant and a player goes to the same place she must then leave"
2442,really ? that's a pretty crazy rule that i have never hard of . did you also know that brad johnson is the only qb to ever throw touchdown pass to himself ?
2443,"how is that possible lol , i might have to look for that strange fact in youtube later , i wonder how the pass went"
2444,it was near the goal line and when he threw the ball it was deflected by a lineman but went right back to him . he caught it and ran it in . was pretty crazy .
2445,"it must have been great and really usual since he is the only one to have done that , i dont know were the fact of the 11 minutes of gameplay comes from , it sure seems like a game is a lot longer and the clock is always paused ."
2446,yeah it would seem like a lot longer than 11 minutes to me as well .
2447,"yeah , football sure is a beautifull game too bad the season is now over ."
2448,do you follow football much ?
2449,"hello there i do watch it , how about you ?"
2450,i love watching it . do you watch both college and nfl ? who are your teams ?
2451,"i follow the packers , how about you ?"
2452,"me too , i love aaron rodgers . i am an iowa hawkeye fan , did you hear that they paint their locker room for the other team pink"
2453,"i heard about that , that is too funny , and i guess it's proven to help the other team relax ."
2454,"right , i think it has worked , they have beat quality teams at home . did you know there is no rule against females playing in the league"
2455,"i think i heard that , i think it would be very cool to see a female player make a roster and play ."
2456,"right , i heard there may be a female kicker going to play college football somewhere , that would be neat"
2457,"yeah it sure would be , even if it was just kicker to start ."
2458,"for sure , that would open up a lot of opportunities . did you hear about the saints cheerleader rule ?"
2459,"i think so , the one where they would have to leave a place if members of the team show ?"
2460,"yea that is pretty sexist in my opinion . that makes the female potential in the nfl take a step back , my opinion"
2461,"yeah i would have to agree with you there , seems dumb to me to be honest ."
2462,"for sure i agree , do you watch college"
2463,"yeah i watch some college but not very closely , always seems like the same schools , how about you ?"
2464,"same , just the hawkeyes mostly . did you hear about the game in 1916 that ended 2220"
2465,i heard about that wow ! i wonder how many of the fans of the opposing team were still in the stands at the end ?
2466,i wonder if they still had a football program after that lol ! i would have quit once the score got to be like 1000
2467,"yeah they just cancel the whole program lol , and how did they even score that many ? you can't even score that much in tecmo super bowl ."
2468,"right lol , that is so crazy . i feel there should have been a mercy rule created after that game lol . it was very nice chatting with you !"
2469,"hi , i read somewhere that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual game play , that's hard to believe isn't it ?"
2470,"yes , anyone who has ever tuned into an nfl broadcast knows that plenty of air time is spent showing players huddling , coaches yelling , and fans cheering"
2471,"yeah , it seems like alot of wasted time ."
2472,i do not like that
2473,"ok , when do you think the nfl will get its first female player ?"
2474,i do not know that . it would be nice if it happened .
2475,"i don't understand , but i would think they are people sitting around and betting on the date the first woman player will be admitted to the nfl ."
2476,sorry i do not know that details .
2477,"ok , that's fine . do you know that the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink ?"
2478,"yes i think , college football . . . visiting locker rooms are often cramped places that aren't meant to be . for a home team's opponents , but the hawkeyes take things up a notch"
2479,i'd say so too . do you know nfl payers have tracking chips embedded in their shoulder pads to record their every move on the field ?
2480,"yes i know little bit , sep 7 , 2017 last season , zebra technologies brought nextgen stats to the nfl by implementing their rfid chips in nfl players' pads to track speed ,"
2481,"that's cool , i wonder who's the fastest player ?"
2482,"i think , ten running backs were faster , and wide receiver john ross set the combine record at 4 . 22 . but it's fournette , the 240pound bruiser"
2483,does fournette play for the jacksonville jaguars ?
2484,sorry i don't know that details please explain .
2485,i was just wondering what nfl team he played for . what is your favorite football team ?
2486,"i like , the green bay packers are a professional american football team based in green bay , wisconsin ."
2487,"oh cool , the packers are good . i like the dallas cowboys , america's team ."
2488,"okay , that nice . which player you mostly like ?"
2489,i like the great tom brady . it's been nice talking with you .
2490,"hello , do you know much about the quarterback position ?"
2491,"i do ! i know that the nfl only has one left handed quarterback now , do you ?"
2492,that's interesting . i did not know that . i know vick was a lefty .
2493,and the great steve young haha . can you believe bowlers once earned more money than football players ?
2494,i find that hard to believe . bowling has really gone downhill since then .
2495,"it really has , or has football gone up ?"
2496,maybe just football has gone up . baker mayfield once thought about quitting football to pursue a career in professional gaming .
2497,"i wonder if he is still great at halo 3 ? i'm surprised alex smith is still playing , given he's basically a genius !"
2498,i have no idea if he is . that's pretty amazing about alex smith . he must be very smart .
2499,"oh for sure . i love watching football games , but hate that there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay ."
2500,that's very surprising . did you know the nfl has no written rule against women playing ?
2501,"i didn't know that , i wonder if any have tried out for teams ! i hate that the new orleans saints kick cheerleaders out of restaurants if a player comes in though !"
2502,i think many teams have rules about players interacting with cheerleaders .
2503,maybe it is needed for the players ? could you imagine being at that college game where the score was 2220 ?
2504,i can't imagine losing by that much . i would be very sad .
2505,i think the whole team would just quit after that haha . that was in 1916 though so it might have gotten better !
2506,iowa painted their opposing team locker room pink .
2507,"i thought that was always interesting , i wonder if it actually did affect other teams ?"
2508,not too sure . i don't see how that would really work all that well .
2509,maybe they should get an emmy like espn did for their yellow line during gameplay ?
2510,"that's pretty awesome . well , it was really good chatting with you today ."
2511,do you know what afc stands for ?
2512,i have no idea is it american football champions ?
2513,i think so . it makes sense .
2514,"haahahaaaa , ok thats awesome i hope so too , why is it called football anyways ? they play it with their hands . i dont get it some times ."
2515,"yes , football should be for soccer games since soccer players play using their feet ."
2516,"you got that right lol , i feel the same way too , i love soccer , and i love watching the players brawl in american football though , so talented i just hope no one dies in the field one day they are talented and strong though , did you know that kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl ? i guess right handed people are just more fit to be qbs ."
2517,i did not know that . are you watching football games this season ?
2518,"not in perticular i am forced to follow them though because of my job , i love talking about sports with my clients"
2519,people talk about sports during business conversations but we need to avoid talking about politics . how do teams choose quaterbacks ? is it like choosing leaders in a company ?
2520,"exactly i agree with you , with sports everything is into play though including race , i dont know how they choose the qb , but i know a fact that only 2 black qbs have won the super bowl"
2521,"thanks for the info . by the way , since we talked about it earlier , afc stands for american football conference , i just did some research while talking to you ,"
2522,"ohhh lol we were not so off then its close to american football confrence , they have come from far though , for example i read somewhere that the first nfl play off game was played on a dirt field in chicago , but now look how fancy the fields are too much money lol , do you think players are overpaid ?"
2523,i just found out that nfl consists of nfc and afc
2524,"ohhh wow , now i know what nfl and afc are so what is nfc then ?"
2525,nfc stands for national football conference .
2526,"wow too complicate , i know though that nfl is one of the 4 majoy pro sports leagues in north america . i think thats pretty boss , and one thing i like is that they play football here in america and it makes enough money to get the robert krafts rich literally the nfl does not have to sell the sport anywhere else if it does not want to ."
2527,nfl owners make so much money i do not mind if the players are overpaid because they are doing dangerous jobs . do you know that there is no rule against female players ?
2528,"i hear you my friend they have so much money if they can pay the athlets that much , lol how much do you think they keep ? ? wait what do you mean no rule against female players ? you mean they can play on a male team ?"
2529,as long as they meet eligibility requirements .
2530,"ohhh wow ! those guys are giants literally , but surprisingly young too , tom brady is getting too old for them i think thats why patriots are not doing very good this year , do you believe women should play on an nfl team ?"
2531,i agree . nice chatting with you .
2532,are you a fan of the nfl ?
2533,"yes , i am a big packers fan !"
2534,"nice ! i like the packers also , i like aaron rodgers . do you like the saints at all ?"
2535,"no way , hate them . what about demarcus lawrence not getting the praise like he should ? he is a great pass rusher !"
2536,"i heard that , i think he will get that big contract though . did you know the saints cheerleaders need to leave a restaurant if the players come , kind of sexist i think !"
2537,"yeah , that would suck to be them . the cheerleaders already don't get paid . i would be so embarrassed ."
2538,"for sure , you know who does get paid well , engineers . they make more than nfl players over their lifetime"
2539,"what ! thats crazy and those quarterback better stay in school and not rely on their bodies . alex smith is very smart , ya know ?"
2540,i heard that and a great player . didn't he get his degree super early ?
2541,yeah and did it right . he can play and get degrees ! did you know the huddle was created by a deaf man ?
2542,"i think i heard that ! wasnt it paul hubbard , he was so good for the browns !"
2543,"exactly , he didn't want anyone to see his hand signals . that is so cool ."
2544,for sure ! are you a college football fan at all ?
2545,"yes , and mayfield is my guy ! he is from ou and we would go watch him play all the time . ya know he wasn't gonna go for football once in his life ?"
2546,"nice . i heard he was a gamer for halo 3 . i could have beat him . i am an iowa fan , they paint the locker rooms of the visitors pink !"
2547,"ha , nice ! i like confidence ! yeah mayfield was gonna go become a gaming pro because nobody could beat him , according to him . yes a pink room would be embarrassing and deflating for the other team . ."
2548,who plays halo 3 anymore lol . i was playing that like 15 years ago . i think the pink calms the other team too much
2549,"oh , that is an interesting outlook . i think i agree . lol ya know the highest scoring game occured in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 . can you believe that ?"
2550,man i would have quit when the game got to 1000 . so embarrassing . good chatting with you !
2551,thank you for the new perspective ! im gonna run with it
2552,"me too , bye !"
2553,hello . how are you .
2554,"im great , are you a football fan ?"
2555,yeah . what do you think about vontaz burfict .
2556,"i think that was a low shot , hitting antonio brown like that , what are your thoughts ?"
2557,i thought it was really low . he does it all the time too only good part was that it cost his team the game . .
2558,"it did , i bet his teamates were upset because of this , it was late in the game so yeah , serious consequences"
2559,yeah . i dont like that dude .
2560,"thats not sport friendly , there was no flag on the play i dont think a suspension is a likely thinng the steelers won 2821"
2561,so what do you think will there ever be a womean in the nfl
2562,"i dont think so , theres no rule against that but i think its unlikely , what do you think ?"
2563,"maybe a kicker , but i doubt it ."
2564,yeah i think it's unlikely .
2565,just think the first time a woman got seriously hurt . it would not go over to well in the media .
2566,what do you think about the 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
2567,i think the game shouldnt last 3 hours with only 11 minutes of gameplay .
2568,"i have the same thoughts , seems like an insult for fans and for viewers , too many adds , too many interruptions"
2569,yeah . i can understand the super bowl taking longer but not regular season games .
2570,"i agree , it does take a long time , the nfl uses tracking chips"
2571,i know they have them in the players shoulder pads as well as in the footballs .
2572,"yeah the chips in the footballs allows us to tell track , velocity , rotation , ball speed"
2573,its such a good invention . we get a bunch of new stats from it .
2574,"i agree a lot of interesting stats , tech is taking over sports ,"
2575,well have a good one . i gotta get off here .
2576,hello . have you ever heard of baker mayfield ?
2577,yes i have ! did you know he actually came close to quitting football in order to pursue a competitive gaming career ? glad he didn't as i would guess football is much more lucrative !
2578,i did hear that and i'm glad he didn't too ! it surprises me though in a way to picture him being so good at video games . in another way i'm not because he is very competitive .
2579,that is true . but you know what really surprises me ? i can't believe there's only one left handed qb in the nfl and that's kellan moore . i figured there'd be far more left handers !
2580,i've never actually noticed but it just seems like there should be . maybe there will be more quarterbacks like patrick mahomes . i think he can throw with either hand .
2581,maybe so ! i wonder if the deaf guy named paul . d . hubbard who created the circular huddles used today to keep opposing teams from reading his hand signals was left handed ?
2582,i don't know . i think it's neat that there used to be a deaf quarterback and i wonder why there's none in current times . the huddle is a smart way to protect his conversations though !
2583,"indeed it is . since we're on the subject of quarterbacks , do you like tom brady ? i bet his old jv high team still kicks themselves to this day for refusing to start him when he was a backup despite never winning a game or scoring a touchdown that season . it's kind of sad , really ."
2584,oh wow ! i bet they do too ! that coach may not even coach anymore after realizing what a mistake he made . i wonder why he just wouldn't give the backup a chance when clearly the starter was not doing so good .
2585,"it's a mystery , isn't it . but coaches sometimes make back decisions . i tell you what i often wonder is why we haven't had a female player drafted yet . females are allowed to play as long as they meet the eligibility requirements , believe it or not !"
2586,"i guess they haven't tried or been able to meet requirements . i've seen a few female players , mostly kickers , on the news and other shows . i know there is a female ref and i think an assistant coach of some kind now ."
2587,"is there really ? i mean , since the average game is only 11 minutes in terms of live gameplay , you'd think we would have at least seen a female kicker by now , right ?"
2588,the nfl is slow moving on some things . just look at the new orleans saints . they have a rule for the cheerleaders that if they are at a restaurant and a player comes in they have to leave .
2589,"that is hard to believe and i can't believe lawsuits haven't been filed yet unless it's just some silly voodoo superstition or something ? either way , in terms of money , women would be better off becoming engineers since they make more than the average lifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players anyway ."
2590,"wow , that really surprises me . i mean , some of these contracts players get are so extreme !"
2591,"hey , even crazier , back in the 1960s , the top bowlers made more than the top football players . that is so depressing considering how rough football is compared to how easy bowling is ."
2592,i guess people weren't that into football back then like they are now . now espn wins an emmy for creating a yellow line to show where the first down is during the game .
2593,that is true and that yellow line is so innovative . i couldn't watch a game without it today ! but thankfully people are more into football today as i couldn't see a bowler making more than benjarvus greenellis who's never fumbled the football in his entire pro career . that would be plain wrong !
2594,that would be wrong and i like that line too . it makes the game more intense and exciting when you know just how far a team has to go . do you watch any college football games ?
2595,i do like to watch college football . but i feel sorry for those teams who play iowa at their stadium and have to sit in a pink lockerroom . i'm not sure if that's good or bad for the university of iowa . ha ! what about you ?
2596,"i love college football ! i think it's better than the nfl actually . have you ever heard about the georgia tech or cumberland game of 1916 ? if not , check it out when you have time . i've got to go . it's been great chatting with you !"
2597,do you know the details of quarterback ?
2598,you mean the position in football ? i know a little
2599,quarterback is one of the most important position in the national football league .
2600,the qb certainly has a challenging role . the game has evolved around the position .
2601,"yes , it's true . do you like football ?"
2602,i watch it from time to time . i'm surprised to learn that tom brady was overlooked by his jv team in high school .
2603,"junior varsity players are the members of a team who are not the main players in a competition , usually at the high school and college levels in the united states ."
2604,i would have expected the coach to recognize talent in the qb that would eventually win 4 super bowls . have you heard of alex smith ?
2605,i think alexander douglas smith is an american football quarterback for the washington redskins of the national football league . is it right ?
2606,i think so . he took a lot of ap tests in high school and started college as a junior . smart guy .
2607,"okay , that's nice ."
2608,"if he doesn't do well in the nfl , i bet he could become an engineer . they make more on average over their careers ."
2609,"okay , last offseason the redskins traded for alex smith , hoping he would fill that hole for several years . but when he suffered the compound spiral fracture of his right leg in november , it left his career in doubt and the redskins needing to plan for life without him . the redskins have made it clear that smith's health , regardless of football , is most important ."
2610,it's good to hear that the team is concerned . i think that he needs to consider other alternatives besides football .
2611,what is your favorite team in national football league ?
2612,probably the green bay packers . they are the only nonprofit team in the league . they are worth a ton of money .
2613,"i like too . the green bay packers are a professional american football team based in green bay , wisconsin ."
2614,they have sold out every game since 1960 .
2615,the packers compete in the national football league as a member club of the league's national football conference north division .
2616,"the players make a lot of money , but an average game has about 11 minutes of live gameplay !"
2617,"yes , and i think this is one of the most famous game in the world ."
2618,did you know that engineers tend to make more over their lifetimes than nfl players ? i guess it's better to be an engineer .
2619,"hi , how are you ?"
2620,im great . how are you ? are you a football person ?
2621,"i'm good , thanks for asking . yes , i like football ."
2622,i don't watch too often . i usually follow the nfl right around playoffs . did you watch the super bowl this year ?
2623,"yes , i watched my favorite team , the patriots pull out another win with my man , tom brady ."
2624,the patriots seem to always win . werent they called the lannisters of the nfl ?
2625,"yes , they've been called that . hey don't hate , appreciate ! lol"
2626,lol . ok . i guess i usually root for the underdog . didnt the pats win last year too ?
2627,they've won a few times the past couple of years .
2628,"um , doesnt brady have like a dozen rings or something ? half a dozen ?"
2629,"yeah , but he deserves every one of them , he has a very good work ethic ."
2630,"yes , he also seems to have a unique diet . strawberryless ."
2631,"don't forget the avocado icecream , he loves so much !"
2632,why avocados ? are they a vegan thing ? he is a vegan right ? is his wife ?
2633,"i'm not sure about that icecream , it's supposed to be creamy with all the good fats , but it sounds just plain gross . i ain't eating it !"
2634,i guess he sees the results and doesnt mind the taste . maybe you add salt or something ? salsa ? i wonder .
2635,uggh ! you're making it worse !
2636,lol . sorry . i got carried away . i guess i should control myself during the chats or i might disgust my partner . sorry .
2637,"lol , he can eat whatever he wants as long as i can eat my chicken wings and drink my beer while watching him play . i sat for over 3 hours watching that last superbowl and about ran out of beer before the end ."
2638,you flirted with tragedy there my friend . you need to be better prepared ! does amazon do sameday delivery of beer on sundays ? plan for success !
2639,"i was a little mad , especially when i keep hearing that there are only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay in a game . wtf ?"
2640,"yeah , a lot of standing around and waiting waiting waiting . anyway , great chat !"
2641,same to you ! have a good evening .
2642,"hello , do you watch football"
2643,"yup . i assume you are referring to american football , like the nfl , and not to the world cup football ?"
2644,"yeah the nfl ? i missed the superbowl this year , did you watch it ?"
2645,yup . brady did it again ! to think he wasn't even a starter in high school . . .
2646,"i know , they missed on a real talent back then for sure"
2647,"another patriot i admire , former running back benjavus greenellis . . . the dude never once fumbled during his entire pro career !"
2648,how amazing is that really . do you know what the highest score in football history is ?
2649,2220 ! talk about shooting a man's horse !
2650,i know that is quite something . georgia tech must be still raving about that
2651,cumberland was scarred for all time ! i bet their players all switched to bowling . . .
2652,hahaha could be . back in the day they would have made much more money
2653,"true . you know what they say , guys do for the girls , the gold , or the glory ! you know , the nfl has no rules against female players ? so the girls could go for the gold and the glory too !"
2654,"i really wonder if we will see that anytime soon . i would like to see it , it might make the game more diverse and fun"
2655,yeah . did you know the univ of iowa painted their visitor locker room pink ?
2656,yeah that is so strange . did you know the espn won an emmy once ?
2657,of course ! they made that gamechanging superimposable yellow line that tells every armchair quarterback where the first down marker is located . only noteworthy thing espn has ever done .
2658,"i guess , interesting to win an award for that . good for them . did you know baker mayfield considered quitting the sport ?"
2659,no ! tell me it isn't so ! why ? was he jealous of alex smith's stellar academic performance ?
2660,hahhaha maybe and also because he wanted to become a professional competitive gamer
2661,"well , he is still just one concussion away from a career as a couch potato , so maybe he should rethink his decision . . . alex smith , who took so many ap courses in high school , he started college as a junior , and yet he still chose a sport where men twice your size try to kill you every sunday . think again alex . . ."
2662,hhaha i know but what a dedication on his behalf go plan that ahead for your career . nice chatting with you
2663,are you a fan of the nfl's cincinnati's bengals ?
2664,"no , i don't follow much the nfl , are they doing good this year ?"
2665,i don't know . i do know that the bengals have a linebacker in trouble for late hits . his name is vontaze burfict .
2666,"now i remember , i think there getting a lot of penalties these day , don't they ?"
2667,i guess . i didn't even know the steeler had a problem with burfict . he sounds like kind of a dirty player .
2668,do you think all the chips and sensors they put in the players' equipment will do anything regarding this issue ?
2669,i'm not sure but i could see where it might help officiating the game . i think it could help qb safety .
2670,"it is a rough sport , i hope they will enforce the rules and increase the safety of the players ."
2671,"yeah , some of them get brain damage . i guess with all the bad hits from burflict , the guy he hit ended up making the gamewinning touchdown ."
2672,do you think they have the same problems with the others variation of football like rubgy or canadian football ?
2673,"probably anything that's a contact sport . it's bad in boxing too . . . then again , the average length of real gameplay in the nfl is only 11 minutes ."
2674,i knew there was a lot of advertisements and replays but not that much . do you think they should do something about that ?
2675,i played in hs and there is a lot of standing around . most of it's moving the poles or substitutions . they could reduce commercials though .
2676,"yes , but it seems that it is still very popular 14 of the biggest stadiums are football stadiums in the us , people seem to like it the way it is ."
2677,"yeah i prefer college football . my alma mater beat cumberland 2220 in 1916 . wow , the coach must of have a vendetta . . ."
2678,"yeah , i would you feel if you were on the winning team ?"
2679,i think i would feel like a bully . we did use circular huddles but i didn't know it was invented for a deaf qb .
2680,they would not have need one for the play of the qb who threw a touchdown pass to himself .
2681,i would have liked seeing that . did you know the nfl has no rule against women playing ?
2682,"no , i did not know that , do you think they want women players or they don't want to offend feminists ?"
2683,"probably just never thought it would come up . in today's ' victim ' society , they are probably keeping it that way for feminists . thanks ! you were great ."
2684,"you too , have a good weekend ."
2685,hello . do you watch football ?
2686,"yes , what is your favorite team ?"
2687,"i don't really have a favorite . i like a few on both sides , the nfc and the afc . what's your favorite ?"
2688,"i like the giants , eli manning is struggling , but i believe that he will come back ."
2689,"maybe , a lot of people say it's all on eli but i think it's a team thing . their offense , not just him , has had trouble performing lately ."
2690,"he did improve , he made changes in his personal life , but the results are not there . . . ."
2691,what kind of changes did he make ? when they played the saints he made 31 of his 41 passes but they still lost the game . that just tells me there's problems with other players .
2692,"he was benched in 2017 , so maybe he had issues with his coach ."
2693,"yeah , i remember that . i wonder if part of the issue is his age . he is 37 now ."
2694,"yeah , he has to get better if he wants to ends his career on a high note , like when georgia tech won 2220 ."
2695,true . is that that game from back in the early 1900s ?
2696,"yeah , it was a long long time ago , against cumberland . how would you feel if you were on the losing team ?"
2697,"if i were cumberland i would feel terrible , demoralized . then again , maybe people just really didn't care all that much about football back then . in the 60s bowlers made twice as much as football players ."
2698,"i think i would just laugh it off , there is nothing to learn from a 222 point defeat ."
2699,you can learn that your defense needs a great deal of work as well as the coaches because whatever game plan the coaches came up with clearly did not work .
2700,"yeah , do you like watching football on tv ?"
2701,"i do . hey , do you think cumberland should have painted their locker rooms pink like the university of iowa does ?"
2702,"maybe , it could not have been worse . do you think there is too much advertisement in football , there is only 11 minutes of live game play in a game ."
2703,yes i do . it seems like they go to commercial after every down practically . what do you think about women becoming players ?
2704,"i think it is a good idea , but is it feasible , they they have the physical strength to compete with men ?"
2705,i don't know . i know there's no rules against them playing if they can meet requirements .
2706,do you like the nfl ?
2707,yes i do . do you know that kellan moore is the only left handed qb ?
2708,wow cool . do you like brady of the patriots ?
2709,"yes i do , he is a good player , is he your favorite ?"
2710,one of them yes . in high school he was a back up qb and never got started
2711,wow their loss i guess . brad johnson once threw himself a touchdown shot
2712,wait what ? how is that even possible ?
2713,"exactly , that is why he is the only guy in history to have done that"
2714,yeah i guess so . alex smith finished college in two years only
2715,"nice , he must be smart . did you know russell wilson is still under contract though he is not playing regularly ?"
2716,wow that is interesting . yes alex was smart but he also took lots of ap tests in high school and managed to move fast
2717,great planner too . snoop dog once wrote a song for his son's team
2718,nice . u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
2719,i wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on the players
2720,i wonder too . in the 60s bowlers made more than the football players
2721,i guess football was not that popular back in the day as bowling was
2722,true . do you know the highest score in college football is 2220 ?
2723,"wow what , when was that and who was playing ?"
2724,yes it was georgia tech who beat cumberland in 1916
2725,wow what a defeat . nice chat
2726,"same here , have a great one"
2727,hello did you know the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink ?
2728,hi ! is it the opposing players locker room that's painted pink or the players locker room ? why would they paint it pink ?
2729,it's the opposing players locker room . it's probably a psychological thing .
2730,"wonder if there's any actual effect or they just want to get in their minds . i have never followed canadian football , i would imagine hockey is considered america's favorite sport instead of football . don't think hockey is quite as big as it is in canada ?"
2731,i think hockey is definitely bigger in canada . i think football and baseball are bigger in america than hockey .
2732,"even basketball too especially for march madness ! maybe canada have women playing in their football leagues because there's no official written rule preventing female players from playing , but no one has yet met the physical requirements to my knowledge ."
2733,did you know the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ?
2734,"does that still hold true , i'd imagine not since it seems as if football stars make a lot more than that and they make much more from endorsements too , if a bowler endorsed something , i don't think i would know them ."
2735,i bet it doesn't still hold true .
2736,unless the league factors in that they only average about 11 minutes of live gameplay so maybe it still does
2737,that's crazy it's only 11 minutes of play .
2738,"yes and yet i devote an entire afternoon to watching the games ! the circular huddle that's used in games today was actually created by a deaf quarterback so the opposing team couldn't read his hand signals , he should've trademarked that !"
2739,that's a cool stat . i saw that greenellis has never fumbled the ball in his nfl football career .
2740,"that's not an easy feat consider people are literally chasing you when you possess the ball , wonder if he can negotiate a better salary with that stat ."
2741,i can't believe he never fumbled . never heard that stat before .
2742,"kellan moore is the only lefthanded quarterback , would the opposing team need to adjust their plays to accommodate that dexterity bias ?"
2743,i'm not sure what the opposing team would need to do to adjust .
2744,"if only the superbowl was as entertaining as the 1916 georgia tech game when they defeated cumberland by 2220 , actually i think that'd be a pretty boring game as well ."
2745,that would be pretty crazy . this past super bowl was pretty boring . probably the most boring one ever .
2746,"yeah , it really was but i still watched the whole thing . to my knowledge , i don't think the rams or patriots cheerleaders are treated like the saints cheerleaders where they are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as the players ."
2747,it was good talking to you take care !
2748,"hi , how are you ?"
2749,"hey i'm good , do you have a favorite quarterback ?"
2750,i like jay cutler . do you ?
2751,"ya he's good , i also like tom brady , kellan moore is interesting because he is left handed and the only quarterback like that"
2752,yeah . i thought there would have been more leftys but i guess he is the only one . do you know who alex smith is ?
2753,"no i don't , i think hes a quarterback but thats all i know"
2754,"he took so many ap tests in high school , he entered college as a junior ! i barely passed high school . what a show off !"
2755,"wow he sounds really smart ! what is weird is that only 2 black quarterbacks have ever won the superbowl , i wonder why"
2756,racism . . . the huddle was created by a deaf qb . who knew !
2757,"ah interesting ! and ya apparenlty a quarterback threw a touchdown pass to himself , how is that possible ?"
2758,was it baker mayfield . he's good at halo 3 ! he claims he can beat anyone at ou in the game .
2759,"wow thats impressive , also impressive that over half of the biggest world stadiums are all american football stadiums"
2760,"there's only one stadium that has a visiting locker room that is pink though , the university of iowa !"
2761,"ya i bet ! only 1 team has a snoop dogg song for their anthem , and that is snoop doggs son's team haha"
2762,espn won an emmy for that yellow line of the field for first downs . seems like a low bar for an emmy .
2763,"ya it seems obvious but maybe it was a big tech breakthrew at the time , have you seen those huge american flags at football stadiums ?"
2764,i have . the ones for the national anthem that is unfurralled ?
2765,"yup those , they cost 50k and are over 1000 pounds , thats nuts !"
2766,i can understnad the cost but 1000 pounds seems really heavy ! for only 11 minutes of play too !
2767,"yup it does seem like a waste , did you hear about the tracking chips the nfl uses ?"
2768,"i love chips , especially doritos ! nice chatting with you !"
2769,do you like the cleveland browns team ?
2770,"not really . i do kind of feel sorry for them . even with joe thomas , i wonder if they could turn things around ."
2771,i don't really follow football at all to be honest . only my hometown football teamthe buffalo bills
2772,i'm a chiefs fan myself . they do say the thomas will soon be in the pro football hall of fame . cold there ? it is here at 15 degrees and snow .
2773,"i think that's great that he will be in the pro football hall of fame . yep it's cold here . it's in the 20s , but not much snow"
2774,"well , i have some snow you can have . i've been to canton , oh but regret not going to the hall of fame ."
2775,i've never really gone anywhere . it doesn't snow as much in buffalo as people think . only in certain areas . tyrod taylor used to be our quarterback .
2776,i remember him . a super browns fan gave me a browns cap on a flight i shared with her . i guess she was a member of the dog pound .
2777,"that's so great ! i hear the browns have really great fans . buffalo does too . we don't have a great team , but we love them ."
2778,back in the day the bills did well . was it the late 1980's ? did you know that the nfl has no rules that women can't play ?
2779,"yep , i think it was the late 80s that we did well . we went to 4 super bowls but couldn't win any of them . the first one was the closest . it still breaks our hearts . the missed field goalwide right are 2 words we all hate"
2780,who was the qb ? i can picture him but can't think of the name . . . did ya know that kellan moore is the only lefthanded qb in the nfl ?
2781,that is interesting about keilan moore . what team does he play for ? our qb's name was jim kelly . we love him . he's battled cancer and won . we really admire him
2782,i'm not sure . i'm more of a football fan my alma maters . i played in hs and we used circular huddles . i didn't know that originated for a deaf qb .
2783,that's great that you played in hs . what position did you play ? i didn't know circular huddles originated for a deaf qb ! that's fascinating !
2784,"i started as a defensive back , safety and special teams . ah , the glory days . funny , we didn't have any pink locker rooms for the visiting team but they did have to use the girls locker room ."
2785,"are you a female ? you had mentioned girls can play in the nfl . i'm a female , but never played sports . i'm not very good at any sports"
2786,"having played football in hs ? nope , i'm a dude . i went to georgia tech and i had no idea we beat poor cumberland 2220 in 1916 ."
2787,that's awesome ! i think it's sad when football players have to retire before they're ready due to injuries
2788,that is terrible . i am grateful that espn created the superimposed yellow first down line . that makes the game more exciting .
2789,i agree . it makes the game much easier to follow for me . makes it more clear whether the player made the first down .
2790,thanks for the excellent chat ! good luck to the bills !
2791,seems like the redskins are in need of a wide receiver
2792,terrelle pryor did struggle quite a bit .
2793,"yeah he didnt catch on and the redskins need something more , among the prospects are alex smith , teddy brigewater , i think they can be good options for the team"
2794,it seems like they have a lot of good prospects that were successful in college . but they have been really lacking in that position for years
2795,"yeah seems like they need each , maybe they can help each other get better they used to be great players so maybe they can recover their level"
2796,"maybe they just need a qb like brad johnson who once threw a touchdown pass , to himself ."
2797,"yeah or like tom brady , he didnt get a chance to play when he was a junipero high school so he might identify with the wide receiver the team wants"
2798,it is kind of crazy that brady didnt get that chance . he really showed them !
2799,"he did , i bet the coach of the former juniperra high school team felt really stupid when he saw brady win all those superbowls , the js high school team was really bad"
2800,definitely . did you know there is only one left handed qb in the nfl
2801,"no i didnt , do you know the name of that qb ?"
2802,kellan moore .
2803,"oh so its kellan moore , i thought he was a righty , nice to know , do you know baker mayfield ?"
2804,didnt he almost leave football for professional gaming ?
2805,"no , i think he was considering going it but stayed with football , he was a great halo 3 player , i wish i could play against him i have mad skills too"
2806,"i heard he thought he could beat everyone at his school , i have never played myself ."
2807,"yeah i did hear that too , he must be pretty good , good thing he stayed in football he is a great qb ,"
2808,"did you know that the flags that span the field weigh 1 , 100 pounds and cost 50 , 000 ?"
2809,"thats really heave and also really expensive , 50000 a pop ! thats way too much money"
2810,"i wonder if there are just a few and they pass them around . that is a lot of money , but they are also playing some of the players millions ."
2811,"football players do make a lot of money , its a good thing to be a pro player , great business specially if you are a qb"
2812,do you like football ? my favorite player is the quarterback
2813,i like football . the player i hate the most is the quarterback
2814,why is that ? what position do you like better ?
2815,"i like defense . defense is most important on the field . they must be the toughest , the roughest , the best ."
2816,"i agree , a qb is no good without a solid defence , so yeah they are really important"
2817,i figure that a good coach knows the value of defense in stopping those pesky qbs . the qb is a target . the qb is a meal the qb is for eating .
2818,"there are some great qb out there , even the best ones get sacked"
2819,i like sacking qbs ! they never see it coming because they're behind the line .
2820,"thats why they must have a great defensive line , do you know who baker mayfield is ?"
2821,is he a qb ? who is he ?
2822,"he is a qb , he considered quitting football and become a pro gamer , apparently he is really good at halo 3"
2823,he probably should stick to video games . that is the safe bet . career is much longer .
2824,"i agree , you can get really injured by playing football then theres also the brain damage ,"
2825,the brain damage from video games is pretty bad too . i had a friend that played them too much . ended up about a simple as a retired player .
2826,"really ? i didnt know about that , but it makes sense , playing video games that long can have negative consequences for sure"
2827,"the brain is a fragile organ , not designed to withstand hours of banal stimulation and entertainment . there should be a warning label on games about cognitive impairment ."
2828,"there should be , but i doubg that will stop gamers , did you hear abouut the qb that created the circular huddle ?"
2829,i have not heard that joke . whats the punchline ?
2830,"not a joke lol , he was a deaf qb that invented the huddle so that the other team wouldnt read his signals"
2831,"oh , ok , that is cool . i thought you were telling a joke . he invented the huddle ? the guy is a legend . anyway , great chat !"
2832,"nope , wasnt joking lol , good chat ,"
2833,"hi , how are you ?"
2834,very good . did you see the super bowl last sunday . as usual the afc and the nfc champs squared off on the first sunday of february ?
2835,"unfortunately , i did not get a chance to watch . what about you ?"
2836,yes . tom brady was the winning qb again . the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . but those are a strenuous 11 minutes .
2837,"on a perminute basis , they get paid pretty well . there is no rule against women in the game . what do you think : will we have women any time soon ?"
2838,"maybe a kicker someday . probably for publicity purposes mainly . since there are 32 teams , each year there are 31 losers ."
2839,"a kicker , or a punter , i agree . there is only one lefthanded quarterback in the nfl : kellan moore . there are many lefthanded pitchers . why so few lefty qbs ?"
2840,"left handed pitchers are hard for left handed batters to hit . i was an assistant scout for the phillies in years past . however , a pass from a lefty in football spins the opposite way and is a little difficult to defend if you don't see it often ."
2841,so lefty qbs have an advantage ? interesting . i thought maybe the front line had to protect the qb differently because the blind side is different . but what do i know anyway .
2842,the alabama qb is a lefty and came in second for the heisman this year . he may win it next year since he was a freshman . how would you like to enter the visitor's dressing room at iowa and dress with pink walls .
2843,"i guess that's supposed to psych out the opposition , but it seems weak . how many games has u of i won at home ?"
2844,"they are better than average , but not elite at home . in the 1960's , pro bowlers made twice as much as pro football players ."
2845,"bowling is a ' sport , ' but not nearly so strenuous or violent as football . probably have good career longevity . nobody watches bowling the same as they did then ."
2846,"that's the amazing thing . the market for the nfl was much smaller and they have to pay a lot more players . smaller than now , not smaller than bowling's market ."
2847,"i guess tv changes everything . the first sb was in the 60s , so i guess the league hadn't organized itself well enough . college ball might have been the bigger draw ."
2848,"i think it was . i mentioned tom brady before . in his jv high school years his team did not win a game , did not score a td and he was the backup and never played a down !"
2849,the coach really blew it there . i think brady has succeeded because of his teammates and head coach as well .
2850,"true . in college , he played for michigan and they hardly passed the ball . so he was drafted 199 . he had talent and no one knew how much . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he entered college as a junior . qbs can be smart ."
2851,i don't know much about the college game . the highest score ever in a football game was in 1916 . georgia tech crushed cumberland 2220 . i wonder if the gt coach put in the third string . what was he trying to prove ?
2852,"my brother played guard in high school and they were beating some team 740 and my brother got to play qb , and he scored . i am surprised he knew where to stand in the huddle where the qb calls the plays ."
2853,"the game should be fun , especially for kids . i enjoyed chatting with you ! have a good night !"
2854,"thanks , bye ."
2855,hey my friend do you have a favorite quarterback ?
2856,"well , i am not into football but i think i would be crazy to not say payton manning ."
2857,"i like brady myself , and i didn't know that kellan moore is actually left handed"
2858,i like tom brady as well . his super bowl wins are so impressive .
2859,"ya i agree , did you hear the backstory to baker mayfield ?"
2860,"yes , he once considered quitting football to game competitively ."
2861,"ya , he made the right movie ! did you hear how the football huddle was created ?"
2862,it was created by a deaf quarterback who did not want the other team to read his hand signals . i like knowing the reason behind the traditions .
2863,"ya me too , it is a genius thing , can't believe the highest football score of all time was 2220 , thats a blowout !"
2864,that sounds like an overpowered team having fun at the other teams expense .
2865,"ya , i would feel so bad to be a cumberland fan that day ! that was back in 1916 though"
2866,football has changed a lot over the years and is even very different in different countries . i like the way they play football in canada .
2867,oh what is the difference in how they play there ? i just think that it was great espn won an emmy for the yellow line they created for first downs in tv football games
2868,they have a larger field in canada . they also get espn in canada and it is very popular .
2869,"ah interesting ill have to look into that , do you like the patriots ? they have 1 player who actually has never fumbled the ball"
2870,everyone loves the patriots except those who have to compete next to them in the super bowl . was that tom brady who never fumbles the ball .
2871,"haha it was not it was benjarvus greenellis , i'd give him the ball every time !"
2872,"oh , i should learn more names from the team . are the patriots your favorite team ?"
2873,"yes i do love the patriots , i'm just glad they make a lot of money too , unlike in the 60's where bowlers made more than nfl players !"
2874,apparently the average lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than the average nfl player .
2875,"ya that is shocking , also shocking is there is no rule against female nfl players !"
2876,if a woman could meet the requirements then they would be eligible . i can imagine that would be very difficult .
2877,"ya i would think so , but i could see a kicker or something happening in our lifetime"
2878,"hi , do you watch american football"
2879,i do not . i used to go to some games in high school but would get distracted by whatever else was happening . i had no idea that there are so many different variations of american football . i have watched rugby before though .
2880,"ohh , i have not watched any rugby game before . btw , did you watch the super bowl last year between the patriot and eagle"
2881,"i did not . if so , i usually only watch for the musical guest . i know that the patriots seem to make it every year . i think its crazy that brad johnson threw a touchdown pass to himself . he must be fast ! did you watch ?"
2882,"i did watch the game . actually the quarterback that threw the pass to himself was nick foles , if i am not mistaken"
2883,"is it ? i just read it in factual section , never actually saw it ."
2884,i have rewatched the game so many times because it was one of the best super bowl games in the history
2885,that's cool . who's your favorite team ?
2886,"green bay packers , you ?"
2887,none of the above . i think its cool though that the nfl started from such humble beginnings .
2888,"yeah , they grow so fast and become the most popular sport in north america . also , did you know that there are only 11 minute of live gameplay in an nfl game ?"
2889,"wow ! and that game goes on forever ! hours ! why do you like it so much ? i'm curious how sports can grow to make stadiums in texas that seat 18 , 000 ."
2890,sport game makes me both feel nervous and loyalty to the team that i root for . what do you feel
2891,it makes me feel bored . are you from wisconsin ? that's where the green bay packers are from ?
2892,"i am from california , but i am a green bay fan because their fan's loyalty got my enthusiasm for football ."
2893,that's cool to hear . football watchers are a pretty loyal bunch . even snoopdogg wrote a song for his high school football team .
2894,"yeah , i heard those snoopdogg's songs and they were hilarious and enjoyable . btw , did you know that women are eligible to play pro football if they are qualified ?"
2895,i wonder what the qualifications are ? i didn't know that before this . i never realized how serious it is . its crazy how one of the coaches is a rocket scientist !
2896,"if a woman has the skill as a man , then she can play the game as long as a team recruits her playing for them"
2897,are there any women in the nfl right now ?
2898,"no so far . btw , nice chatting with you . enjoy your holiday"
2899,you too ! merry christmas ! and next year be your year for your team !
2900,the browns have made a strategic move and are expeced to do well because of it .
2901,i saw they agreed to trade to draft picks to the dolphins .
2902,"yes , yes , and they got jarvis landry who led the nfl in the past season ."
2903,he had 112 catches last season . they also agreed to send a 3 round pick to the bills .
2904,they got tyrod taylor for that trade . it looks like a potential trade for damarious randall is still in the works .
2905,todd haley will have a nice roster and plenty of potential .
2906,the browns might even get their pick of prized quarterbacks .
2907,wouldn't that be awesome ? they are wondering if taylor was the right selection . he was benched in favor of a rookie .
2908,"yes , he did help to reach the playoffs but seems like he was in over his head against jacksonville ."
2909,taylor's just the temporary starter quarterback . they could draft sam darnold or josh rosen .
2910,that is good . it seemed as if taylor's performance is a bit unpredictable .
2911,he started the last three season and only has 51 touchdowns . i would be a little leary . there's always room for improvement .
2912,why do you think they traded for taylor ?
2913,he wasn't valuable to them anymore . they could get a new player who would pair well with the players .
2914,it seems that they have several different choices for quarterbacks and that it's a step in the right direction .
2915,or what if they go with penn state running back saquon barkley ?
2916,i don't know too much about him but it seems like that would be a surprise choice .
2917,they wouldn't have their choice of quart backs .
2918,"yes , but it seems they would still get one of them ."
2919,"the consultant to the browns , scot mccloughan like mayfield ."
2920,"yes , he likes mayfield , but apparently mayfield is polarizing . i wonder what that means ."
2921,he just has a presence about him like lamar jackson . people want to see him play because he all the great attributes .
2922,i see
2923,"hello , the national football league , nfl , is a professional american football league consisting of 32 teams , divided equally between the national football conference , nfc , and the american football conference , afc , ."
2924,did you know that they use tracking chips in footballs and shoulder pads in the nfl ?
2925,"not at all , what does this work for ?"
2926,"they use it in footballs to track velocity , rotation , ball speed and location . in the shoulder pads they record players every move on the field"
2927,"go , they want to have all the movements calculated , this football is fantastic"
2928,if you visited iowa's locker room it is pink .
2929,"yes , yes , i've heard a lot about it , i heard that they do it to scare other teams or show that they are better"
2930,that is strange ! former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled in the nfl !
2931,"he's talented , i think that's what i think competitiveness"
2932,do you watch favorite football games on thanksgiving ?
2933,"yes , i am always aware of the matches"
2934,predictions were that the cowboys would beat the redskins . the jaguars were stated to be an unreliable team in the nfl .
2935,"wow , this team must have an excellent football behavior"
2936,steelers ben roethlisberger ranks 8th in qbr
2937,"well , they should improve if they want to occupy the first place"
2938,haha . the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback to prevent his hand signals from being read
2939,there are so many surprises everywhere
2940,in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars
2941,seriously ? there must have been more public on one side than on the other supporting the sport
2942,also the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl and average mlb player
2943,"well , being an engineer was a lot of things"
2944,hey there ! are you a fan of the nfl ?
2945,hello ! i am ! are you ?
2946,"i am ! do you have a favorite team ? i'm from texas , so i'm obligated to root for the cowboys !"
2947,haha i am a vikings fan ! the cowboys are fun to watch too ! can you believe there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay ?
2948,"no ! that's wild ! it's hard to follow on the tv sometimes , so thank goodness they created that superimposed yellow line for the first down ."
2949,didn't that win an emmy for espn ?
2950,it did ! a tv network won an award for tv shows !
2951,oh nice ! i wish they had footage of that game that was 2220 in 1916 !
2952,right ? ! back when georgia tech beat cumberland
2953,that would have been a sight to see . a very sad sight lol . do you have a favorite quarterback ?
2954,haha ! i don't . . . none that still play anyway . are you a tom brady fan ?
2955,oh gotcha ! i think he's a good player but i wouldn't call him my favorite haha .
2956,"yeah , people disagree with his morals , i guess , haha ! did you know his jv coach didn't care much for him either ?"
2957,he didn't even put them in when they were doing absolutely terrible ! jokes on him i guess !
2958,right ? he went on to win 4 super bowls !
2959,6 now actually lol . do you ever think a girl will ever tryout for a team ?
2960,"i'm not sure . i know they're technically allowed , and i would love to see that ! it's just such a sexist industry ."
2961,it really is ! i would love to see it too ! the saints are sexist about their cheerleaders as well !
2962,"i know , can you believe the cheerleaders are forced to get up midmeal if any nfl player walks in ?"
2963,"that is crazy ! they need to update that like they do their technology ! anyways , it was great chatting with you !"
2964,enjoy your night !
2965,hello do you watch nfl ?
2966,i do watch the nfl . do you ?
2967,love it . great team sport .
2968,absolutely . i can't believe an average game is only 11 minutes without commentary and commercials .
2969,i wish the season than 16 games .
2970,"i wonder why female players are playing football , apparently it's not against the rules ."
2971,maybe one will start as a kicker ?
2972,that would be cool .
2973,did you know there are chips in the footballs to track ?
2974,"no didn't , that is interesting . what exactly do the chips track ?"
2975,good question since the refs still get a lot of calls wrong lol .
2976,i know right . maybe that's why the highest scoring game ever was 2220 !
2977,georgia tech should be ashamed to run up the score like that !
2978,"haha , i know it's crazy ."
2979,or you would think cumberland would have forfeited
2980,yeah you would think so . do you think it's kind of mean to paint a visiting's team locker room pink or smart ? the university of iowa did .
2981,mind games i guess ? did you know espn won an emmy for inventing the yellow line ?
2982,that is a weird thing to win an emmy for .
2983,i wonder if rb green ellis ever got anything for not fumbling for his whole career ?
2984,"i'm not sure but he should have , that's a huge accomplishment ."
2985,yeah i would be proud ! nice talking to you and good night !
2986,"you too , bye !"
2987,"hello , how are you today !"
2988,"good , do you like any variations of football , from rugby to soccer ?"
2989,"yes , i love to go to the football games and soccer !"
2990,but do you have a favorite between soccer and football ?
2991,"long time buccaneer fan , and new england !"
2992,"ok , you seem to know more than a few things about football if you can appreciate 2 teams at the same time . since when do you watch the nfl ?"
2993,since jr . high school a long time . a whole family thing ! and you ?
2994,"i don't watch football regularly , not even the superbowl , there are 11 minutes of live gameplay in a game . it is not enough to sustain my attention ."
2995,"yes , i understand . do you like soccer ? i love that too !"
2996,"i wish i watched more soccer , but they don't show matches where i live , do you have a favorite soccer team ?"
2997,"we have a new team , where we live so getting popular . i didn't know there is no written rule against female players . lol"
2998,it is either progressive from their part or regressive as an unlikely concept
2999,"ha , ha , ha , i was thinking the same thing !"
3000,"i have ambiguous feeling about the nfl , it is quite violent , there are only 16 games in a season , it is probably because if there were more there would be too much injuries among the players ."
3001,"yes , i agree ! those tracking chips are helpful as far as tracking . how about that 2220 score in 1916 !"
3002,that is around 30 touchdowns ! or a td every 2 minutes . i think people just stopped clapping to save their hands .
3003,"lol , picture that ! omg . . . top football stars made less than top bowlers in 1960 ."
3004,"it was another era , it bowling could be as violent as football today , bowler would be paid more ."
3005,"your right ! lol , didn't know cheerleaders have to leave when football player comes into restaurant . guess too much togetherness ! lol good chat ! !"
3006,"that is another retrograde attitude from the nfl , i hope that will change that soon ."
3007,"yes , i do too !"
3008,hey ! do you follow football ?
3009,hello ! i follow football as much as i can . probably equal parts college and the national football league . how about you ?
3010,"i tend more to the college side , but it is all good by me"
3011,"i guess you might as well through in high school as well , especially if you are in texas . allen , texas , has a 60 million , 18 k seat high school stadium !"
3012,that is huge ! that team is probably pretty good to have that kind of facility . much better than cumberland from 1916 !
3013,tell me more about cumberland . do they have a team anymore ?
3014,"im not sure , but they lost to ga tech 2220 in 1916 ."
3015,"wow . it must be some sort of record . speaking of lovable losers , the cleveland browns returned to the nfl in 1999 . despite playing eight home games per season , do you know who has the most wins in that stadium ? opposing steeler quarterback ben roethlsberger ."
3016,"wow , even more wins than the browns ? that's sad . my team , the dolphins isnt much better though ."
3017,"at least the weather is nicer . maybe you need a rocket science head coach . believe it or not , coach matt patricia actually is a rocket science !"
3018,maybe he can figure out why it takes 3 plus hours to play a game when there is only 11 minutes of active game play .
3019,he should get right on that . they spend so much money already . players and even the footballs have tracking devices that record every movement on the field .
3020,i wonder how they use all that data . it seems like gathering it they should have a big purpose for it .
3021,"i am sure part of it is to ensure they are getting the most out of their investments . i wonder how that works for russell wilson who hasn't played baseball since 2011 , but is still on an mlb contract !"
3022,id like that kind of deal !
3023,"amazingly he is also only one of two africanamerican quarterbacks to win a super bowl . doug williams was the first . interestingly , they both got their wins over the broncos ."
3024,"that's pretty incredible . i remember when warren moon played in the nfl for the vikings , i think he was the first african american quarterback in the nfl , but not the first to win ."
3025,"some big name quarterbacks for sure , but none may ever reach brad johnson who actually is the only qb to throw a td pass to himself . it must have been tipped !"
3026,"had to have been , although i am curious to see the highlight reel for that one ."
3027,"the nfl has definitely come a long way since . i mean , way back in 1932 the first playoff game was actually played on a dirtfield in a hockey stadium that was only 80 yards long ."
3028,"wow , it certainly has . even recent years improving home viewing with replays and that yellow line ."
3029,i couldn't imagine a game without it and constantly have to remind myself the players can't see it !
3030,"haha ! me too , my mom was shocked when she went t my brothers first high school game years ago that the line wasnt there ."
3031,lol . i wonder what she would think if she found out that those big american flags in the stadiums cost like 50 k and weigh about a ton !
3032,ill have to tell her ! its been great chatting tonight !
3033,"did you watch the nfl games last weekend ? my favorite team the ravens , and their new qb lamar jackson , unfortunately have already been eliminated ."
3034,i did watch . what happened to joe flacco ?
3035,"he's gt hurt , missed a few games , lamar took his spot , and that's all she wrote ."
3036,what do you think of saints quarterback drew brees ? he's good whether he's under pressure or not .
3037,"yeah , he's been good for a long time . they had been crushing teams until this past weekend . even their defense was clicking . oh well . that was a bad call though ."
3038,i heard they wore white because the coach lost a bet to the eagles coach .
3039,possibly . if i had to start a team though i'd definitely take andrew luck over brees . he had a good season behind his revamped offensive line .
3040,so what do you think about a possible female coach ? the browns want to talk to condoleeza rice about the job .
3041,i don't see it . i know there is no written rule preventing female players either but not sure how realistic that is .
3042,strangers things have happened . matt patricia is a rocket scientist or aeronautical engineer .
3043,"i know . maybe he should do that because he hasn't been very successful as a head coach . through the 17 week regular season , he hasn't proven enough to me yet ."
3044,i think he needs another year to see . it's tough to judge a coach based on their first year .
3045,"i suppose . he must like it though . the average lifetime earnings are stastically higher for an engineer than an nfl player , so you could do fine elsewhere ."
3046,true . seems like more is spent on stadiums than people . a high school football stadium in texas cost 60 million to build .
3047,"yeah , i knew hs football is huge in tx . not as big as the superbowl which is usually held the first sunday in february , but still huge ."
3048,college football is getting huge too . 14 of the worlds largest stadiums are from american colleges .
3049,yup . baker mayfield from the university of ok played in a pretty large stadium .
3050,yes he did . players can do more than just football to earn money though . russell wilson was under contract with the texas rangers baseball team til last year .
3051,and baker mayfield actually considered quitting football to pursue full time competitive gaming .
3052,now that's interesting ! the military football teams coaches work for the department of defense . they are the highest paid employees there .
3053,that must be a cool job . defensive coach for a military foot team . i wonder how much gamplay time is in the college game . the average nfl game on has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay .
3054,"i don't know . i guess it's be close to the same . but then again , football has different variations and rules globally ."
3055,do you like football ?
3056,i love it . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
3057,i wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on the players
3058,good point . bowlers made more in the 60s than football players
3059,yes i guess football was not as popular back in the day
3060,true . do you know the highest score in a college football game
3061,yes that was 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
3062,yes and that was way back in 1916
3063,yes . did you know that espn won an emmy once ?
3064,yes that was for the superimposed yellow line
3065,yeah it has made gamewatching easier for sure
3066,yeah true . do you like brady ?
3067,i love him he is so good . did you know he was a backup qb in high school
3068,yes and they never started him even when they were doing really bad in the field
3069,yeah their loss . do you like alex smith ?
3070,"yes i do , he is good at school too , finished college in two years"
3071,yes he took lots of ap tests in high school and planned ahead
3072,yeah smart kid . do you know who invented the circular huddle ?
3073,yes paul hubbard who was deaf and did not want other to understand him
3074,yeah smart . it was nice chatting with you
3075,"same here , take care"
3076,"hello there , do you follow the nfl at all ?"
3077,"hello , i love the nfl . what about you ?"
3078,"yeah i follow pretty closely during the season , i thought the super bowl wasn't nearly as exciting as last year though ."
3079,this super bowl was so boring lol . did you know iowa painted the opposing team locker room pink ?
3080,"yeah it was and i think i heard about that ! too funny , i wonder who came up with that idea in the first place ?"
3081,not too sure lol . the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars .
3082,"that is pretty wild , i would have loved to been a bowler back then . it also shows how much the nfl has grown since then ."
3083,i agree . bowling stars probably don't make much these days .
3084,"no , and definitely not much compared to the salaries that pro football players now make ."
3085,most definitely . the highest score ever in a football game was 2220 .
3086,"that is incredible ! i think i have read about that game , i think it was poor cumberland on the losing side of that one ."
3087,that would be one very boring game to watch . i would have given up if i was on cumberland .
3088,"yeah those fans too , i wonder how many of the cumberland faithful were still there when it ended ."
3089,i bet no one was still around lol . greenellis went his entire football career without fumbling the ball .
3090,"that is very impressive , i wonder how many total carries he had in his career ?"
3091,i bet he had a lot because he was a starter . i remember watching him with the bengals . i'm a bengals fan .
3092,yeah and if you have played for multiple teams chances are you have had your fair share .
3093,i bet . did you know the nfl uses tracking chips in players pads ?
3094,"i have heard that , crazy how much tech is in the game now , do you think it will be used to improve safety ?"
3095,"i hope so . they track ball speed , velocity , rotation , and location . nice chatting with you !"
3096,"yeah same here , hope you have a good day !"
3097,i was so glad the patriots won the super bowl ! they're my team because i lived in new england for awhile . did you watch the game ?
3098,"yes , it was good . the game started off slow until the fourth quarter ."
3099,yeah it was a pretty low scoring game . and i thought the halftime show was just as boring . are you a maroon 5 fan ?
3100,"no , i was sure who they were until i looked them up online , i think the lights and fire display help their performance ."
3101,"i knew of them , but i didn't know of any of their songs . what i think is funny is that the university of iowa's locker room for the visiting football team is painted pink ! that's sort of petty !"
3102,"i agree , i guess they painted it pink especially for visitors , in a way of speaking visiting teams are weak ."
3103,yeah exactly . and it's crazy how much football players are paid today compared to the 1960s when professional bowlers were actually paid more than football players .
3104,"yes that's true , back in the 1960s the players weren't protective as they are today with padded helmets and so many penalty calls ."
3105,yeah i bet they had a lot of injuries ! also it shocked me to hear the highest football scoring game was 2220 ! ouch !
3106,"wow , i wonder what kind of football team they were playing and what about the coach , what did he had to say ?"
3107,"it was college football , but if that happened in the nfl , they would be heckled for running up the score for like rubbing it into their competitor's faces . i guess that didn't exist back then ."
3108,"yes you are right and maybe i am wrong , but i think the coach wouldn't have any excuse to remain coaching that team ."
3109,yeah that could be it too . and i also didn't know espn won an emmy for being the first channel to use the artificial yellow line to marks where the first down line . that really helps to know where the teams actually have to go to get a first down .
3110,"i didn't know that either , never cross my mind , yes i can't imagine playing on a team without known where the first down marker ."
3111,do you have a favorite football team or are you not interested in football ?
3112,"i like football , i like college football better than pro football . my favorite team pittsburgh , what about you ?"
3113,my favorite team is the patriots . i really think tom brady will be one of the best qbs in the hall of fame . it's crazy that in high school he was a backup qb and never got a chance to play .
3114,"forgot , you did tell me your team earlier , yes , people think that the patriots won too many games super bowls , but not really , talent is talent , their sixth ring ."
3115,yeah the most super bowl wins ever . i wonder if that title will ever be broken .
3116,"i don't think so , because the patriots always had a smart coach , come from behind team and a calm quarterback ."
3117,yeah belichek is one of their secret weapons along with tom brady . they make a good team .
3118,do you follow football ? my favorite position is the qb
3119,i do follow football im a chiefs fan but i do like tom brady he is very talented
3120,"he is really talented , i am a fan of the patriots so i definetely love him ,"
3121,yeah the patriots have had a lot of good players like ellis . he never fumbled a football in his entire career with the nfl .
3122,"that's amazing . the level of skill that requires , i bet only a few players have accomplished that or maybe ellis is the only one , sounds like a hard thing to do ."
3123,yeah i bet it would be hard to do . . this last superbowl was kinda sad . . i mean the scores where just so low . .
3124,"it was sad , i was happy because my team won but it was a boring superbowl , hopefully next year we can watch a better show"
3125,yeah hopefully i went to a chiefs game this year it was exciting mahomes is a great quarterback
3126,"i havent seen him play , how old is he ?"
3127,he is 23 i think he is like the youngest player to ever get the mvp of the nfl
3128,sounds like the chiefs have a qb for a while . he can be the next brady .
3129,that's what i hope will happen . before becoming the first overall pick in 2005 draft alex smith recieved his bachelors degree in two years . then he went on to get his masters . i couldn't imagine being a quarterback and doing that much school in that much time .
3130,"sounds like he is not only a great qb but also a really smart person , he received the degree in just 2 years and then his masters , thats incredible"
3131,yeah it is . . . did you know that the huddle was started by a deaf quarterback paul hubbard . . he did it so the other team couldnt read his signals
3132,"he started a legacy , that is a sure thing , do you know who baker mayfield is ?"
3133,no who is he
3134,"he is a qb not only talented in the game but also a master video game player , he almost left football to become a pro gamer"
3135,well he can always do that when he retires from football
3136,"i guess he can , he will have plenty of time and money to pursue that other dream ,"
3137,most definately . . when tom brady was in highschool his coach never started him
3138,"thats ironic , considering brady is like the best qb in the history of nfl lol"
3139,good morning ! how are you ? i am sad football is over for the season . are you a fan .
3140,good morning ! i am a fan and am sad as well . i'm watching the new football league to make up for it . it's not the nfc or afc conferences but it's still nfl .
3141,i've not heard of that . i'm only familiar with the 32 nfl teams .
3142,i think it's called the alliance of american football . it started up after the superbowl back in february .
3143,i'm surprised that i've not heard of it . i like that the nfl allows women to play as long as they can meet league requirements .
3144,i think all of the games are shown on the nfl network . i like that too . maybe someday there will be women on the teams .
3145,i think it would be dangerous for women to play alongside men . i guess the nfl rules are more forward thinking that the rules the saints have for their cheerleaders .
3146,perhaps but if a woman can meet the requirements then she would have had to prove herself strong and capable . what kind of rules do the saints have ?
3147,"yes , i guess that is a good point . saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as an nfl player ."
3148,maybe they do that to prevent scandals in the news and such . keep the players focused on the game ?
3149,"maybe , but i think it's extreme to think that if a cheerleader is already at a restaurant and a player comes in she has to get up and leave , even midmeal ."
3150,"well yeah , that is extreme . they should change that to the last person to walk in has to leave regardless of whether they are a player or a cheerleader ."
3151,i agree . i can not believe how little actual live game play there is in an average game .
3152,what do you mean ?
3153,i guess an average game only has something like 11 minutes of actual game play .
3154,"wow , that is a surprise . i mean , a game lasts three hours and they only actually play for 11 minutes ?"
3155,i know ! an even more interesting fact is that an engineer over a lifetime earns more than an average nfl player .
3156,that is interesting . it really makes you think . especially when you realize all that goes into a game and player . the nfl spends money to put tracking chips on the players to record their every movement .
3157,"yes , i've heard they put tracking chips in the players shoulder pads . i bet it helps make strategic game plays ."
3158,"i bet it does too . then there are chips inside the footballs to record it's movements too . in a way , football is becoming very scientific ."
3159,"yes , i agree ! it has been fun chatting today . have a good day !"
3160,are you a fan of the nfl ?
3161,hey ! yes i am a big nfl fan . the bears are my team !
3162,"nice , they are just one of the 32 teams . sorry but i am a vikings fan . . . ."
3163,"haha , my wife is a vikings fan so i cheer for them too . it is crazy to love a sport so much that only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay !"
3164,"nice good to hear that . that is so crazy to think only 11 minutes , i wonder what is the other 3 hours lol"
3165,"a lot of filler and cheerleaders ! fun fact i recently learned about cheerleaders , the saints forbid their cheerleaders from eating in the same restaurant as any of their players ."
3166,"that isn't too fun , it sounds kind of sexist , what do you think ?"
3167,"it is sexist for sure and wrong . interestingly enough , the nfl has no rule prohibiting female players !"
3168,"i'm surprised ! i couldn't imagine that happening , but i did hear a female kicker may be the first soon"
3169,that would be cool . i know some college teams have had female kickers . colorado is the biggest school to have i believe .
3170,"wow , i did not know that . my team is the iowa hawkeyes , they have a pink locker room for visitors"
3171,"that is some subtle gamesmanship ! i actually went to maryland . our recent coordinator hire , matt canada , had to take over the coaching duties last year ."
3172,"yea that was unfortunate on what happened with the player and coach being fired , sad to hear"
3173,"yes , a very sad story all around . canada was pretty good last season . he set school records at pitt for his offensive production ."
3174,"nice , i did not know that . i wonder if benjarvus green ellis played for him in college . he never fumbled once in his football career"
3175,that is a crazy stat ! it is amazing how far football has come . at one point in the 1960s the top bowlers were making double the top football stars !
3176,"that is so crazy , now it pays to be an engineer though , they make more money in their lifetime than most players do"
3177,"that is shocking ! i wonder if some players are actually really smart like alex smith . he had so many ap credits , he was able to enroll in college as a high school junior !"
3178,"that is crazy to think , and he became the first overall pick in 2005 , smart man ! good chatting with you ."
3179,nice chatting with you today too !
3180,have a great day !
3181,"hi , do you watch nfl ?"
3182,"hey , yeah i do ."
3183,did you now women can play too ?
3184,"no , really ? i thought it was just for men ."
3185,"nope , if you make the cut , you play"
3186,that's cool . i hope to see a woman in the nfl one day . do you think it's true saints cheerleaders can't eat at the same restaurant as nfl players ?
3187,yeah but i totally diasgre with that rule . they have to even leave if they are mid meal
3188,i know ! that is insane .
3189,did you know they make less than engineers ?
3190,"i wonder how much engineers make because nfl players make a lot . oh , i seen where the nfl uses tracking chips in player's pad and the footballs !"
3191,yeah that is really nice becuase they can get lots of useful statistics from those now
3192,"yeah , i didn't know that . it makes sense how the announcer are able to view the replays and stuff ."
3193,yeah for sure . did you know there are only 11 minutes of gameplay in a game ?
3194,"yeah , and everything else is commercials and replays ."
3195,yeah exactly . you know what the highest score in football history is ?
3196,"no , i'm not sure , what is it ?"
3197,it is 2220
3198,that is insane ! what teams ?
3199,"georgia tech beat the cumberlands , yeah it is insane and boring i would assume"
3200,"very boring , a complete blow out ."
3201,for sure . nice chat
3202,hi . are you a college football fan ?
3203,i like the nfl
3204,"okay ! me , too . which team , s , do you like best ?"
3205,i like the patriots since they are like the lannisters of football
3206,definitely . did you see this year's sb ?
3207,the opening was a bit slow
3208,"sure , but the 4th quarter made up for it ! what do you think of tom brady ?"
3209,"despite his age , he is still an amazing player"
3210,"agree . did you know that , when he played jv football , his team didn't win a game or even score a td , yet his coach never put him , as backup qb , into a game ! think he's come a long way since those days ?"
3211,ya he was underappreciated and now he is considered the biggest steal in nfl history
3212,"for sure . prob . the greatest qb , with 6 sb rings to date . watching his throws is a thing of beauty . wonder why fb teams don't huddle much anymore ?"
3213,well the huddle initally were created by a deaf qb to prevent other players from seeing his hand signals
3214,that makes sense . does huddle take too much time ?
3215,"not really , but it is kind of like a group cheer too"
3216,"i see . am a big ten penn state fan . loved to watch saquon barkley , now a rb w or the ny giants run . think he just won rookie of the year . have you seen him ?"
3217,"no , but curious to learn more"
3218,"watch 2018 season highlights on youtube . barkley is featured . do you like patriot's rb , gronkowski ?"
3219,i liked green ellis more
3220,"okay . know him , too . great player ! brady has a lot of choices really deep offensive line , don't you think ?"
3221,ya i mean the qb is the core of any offensive
3222,"and its leader . do you think , if they met elig . requirements , we'll ever see women on nfl teams ?"
3223,"anyway , thanks for chatting and i hope you have a wonderful day ."
3224,"you , too . catch saquon's magical athleticism if you have time ! cheers !"
3225,"hello , do you play or watch football ? , american football ,"
3226,"yea , it's funny how the redskins were able to blow the nfc east lead after winning over dallas earlier in the season"
3227,"haha , agreed . did you know that greenellis has never fumbled a ball in his entire career ?"
3228,"that is pretty crazy , i remember greenellis use to play for the patriots , i don't think i've seen him fumble"
3229,"yep , imagine not fumbling a ball for your entire career . must have been hard !"
3230,"yea , i wonder if the nfl was able to find out how he did it with the tracking chips they put into player's equipment"
3231,i wonder . they also put tracking chips in the football to track its velocity and rotations . maybe that helps as well .
3232,"possibly , it's amazing how much info they can get when the game only averages 11 minutes of live gameplay"
3233,yeah . i wonder how people do not get bored while watching football .
3234,"i don't know , i wonder if that was why top bowlers made twice as much as football players in the 1960s"
3235,i wonder how they made so much . engineers also make more than football players in their lifetimes .
3236,"i heard engineers make more than mlb players too , i guess paying attention in school pays off"
3237,"yep , although i am guessing that you have to be a veteran engineer to make that much ."
3238,"i suppose so , i bet cumberland had a team full of engineers when they lost to georgia tech 2220"
3239,"well , that was back in 1916 but that still must have been a very embarrassing defeat ."
3240,"yea , tv wasn't even around back then but now we got yellow first down lines winning emmys"
3241,did you know that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
3242,that's pretty crazy but not as crazy as deaf quarterback paul d . hubbard
3243,i wonder how he even communicated strategy with his team then .
3244,hubbard invented the huddle just to do so using hand signals
3245,"and to make it so that the other team could not see his hand signals . anyways , thank you for your time ! it was nice chatting with you !"
3246,"you too , have a good one"
3247,hi ! do you follow sports of any kind ?
3248,"not usually , but i do keep an eye on the nfl when it gets near the playoffs"
3249,"so i take it you don't participate in sports gambling then ? it's actually legal in any state that wants to pursue it according to a supreme court ruling , i had no idea !"
3250,i can understand that being a state level law though with how much money nevada's government probably makes . the trends would be hard to predict though
3251,"yeah , so far new jersey , delaware , west virginia , and mississippi have participated in it and legalized it and it's also open to ncaa as well as pro sports as well . seems so risky though !"
3252,definitely ! i'd much rather watch the game for enjoyment than bet my money on anything . i went to a few high school games back in the day . their fight song wasn't nearly as cool as the one snoop dogg would have written for his son's team
3253,"yeah , i think i would feel so antsy and suffer from immense tachycardia if i were to place money on the outcome of a game . i wonder if players are paid ' side money ' to throw the ball a certain way or purposefully not catch it when there's sport betting involved ."
3254,"probably not , but there may not be a way to find out for sure . quarterbacks typically make enough to not need side money . i guess it pays to be the leader of the offensive team if you make it to the nfl"
3255,"yeah that's true but may not be so true if it was still back in the 60s because top bowlers back then made twice as much as top football stars did ! i don't even think bowling gets broadcasted anymore , does it ?"
3256,"it might if you have all the expensive espn channels . football has become a big deal over the decades though , to the point that there's a stadium in texas that seats 18 , 000 and cost 60 million to build . the most shocking part is that it's a high school stadium"
3257,"a high school stadium ? ! it really is true , everything sure is bigger in texas , even stadiums ! espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line that represents the first down for football , i didn't know they created that ."
3258,"it sure is helpful in watching the games though . they spend 50 , 000 for the huge american flags at football stadiums . in addition , it takes a lot to lift all 1 , 100 of the flag"
3259,yeah good point . i wonder when the athletes train at those nice stadiums whether or not their egos are affected . who's job is it to lift those flags ?
3260,"i'm not sure . i wonder if all the stadiums have them . of the largest stadiums , 14 of 25 are for college teams"
3261,"oh ok , i didn't realize flags were that expensive ! wonder if they're locked up somewhere each day . i would think that even though the nfl has no written rule against female players , it would be difficult for females to meet the league's physical requirements in order to play ."
3262,"it would be a risk to get tackled . the only professional football i see girls playing is association football , also known as soccer"
3263,"yeah ! i think there might be a lot of controversy surrounding that if females had played but considering that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the lifetime earnings of an nfl player , it might not be worth the risk afterall"
3264,"engineering is another field that has a sparse number of women , pun intended , . have you ever heard of the quarterback brad johnson ?"
3265,"lol , that's a great observation ! no , i'm not familiar with brad johnson , what is he known for besides being a quarterback ?"
3266,"not only did he win the super bowl , but he's also the only quarterback to throw a touchdown pass to himself"
3267,oh wow ! that's an amazing feat ! i don't think even tom brady has one of those under his belt .
3268,"no , but he does have six super bowl rings . there's only one quarterback in the nfl who is left handed"
3269,what are the rings worth ? ! they seem a bit excessive but they did work hard to get those
3270,"hi , do you like football ?"
3271,"yeah . i watched the last superbowl . i was surprised to see the rams win , even with coach mcvay . the had a balanced offense and defense ."
3272,i heard mcvay is the youngest coach in football . that is cool .
3273,"yeah , he is wise beyond his years . it's hard to find holes in his defense ."
3274,"they have a lot of talent on that defense , albeit , troubled talent ."
3275,yep . all teams seem to have their share of offfield troubles . the rams defense has a great secondary . something i wish my chiefs had .
3276,but you have mahomes . . . that seems like a good weapon !
3277,"yeah , he's really young and really good . i hope he can stay healthy . the article i read recently was dated but it correctly picked the rams as superbowl favorites ."
3278,didn't the pats win the super bowl ?
3279,"yes , that's right . doh ! the rams lost 313 . back in 1932 the first nfl playoff game was on an 80yd dirt field . it's improved a bit since then . . ."
3280,"kinda . . . the raiders play on the baseball field . i feel bad for them , well , when they were in oakland ."
3281,"i think they are moving across the bay to sfo this year . funny , snoop dog wrote his kid's team's fight song . did he leave out the expletives ?"
3282,how would you like to be his son . i was reading that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of play .
3283,"i played in hs and , although there was a lot of standing around , that seems too low ."
3284,i get the redzone and i cannot watch a regular game any more because it is too slow . i would be bored watching just one game .
3285,"do what i do . record it and ff the hell out of it later . only two black qbs have won the superbowl . i say , so what ?"
3286,my remote ff by like 27 seconds and it needs to be 25 seconds . i can ff but miss the start of the play . i do that once in a while and rewind when i see something good happen .
3287,yeah . i have direct tv and it works well . it automatically backs up a little . did you know kellan moore is the only lefthanded qa in the nfl ?
3288,i was just having a conversation with someone about that . i wonder if the rotation of a lefthanded ball means anything . do you know ?
3289,i don't but the number seems low . mlb has many lefthanded pitchers . did you know a qb actually passed a td pass to himself ?
3290,i did not know that . it was nice chatting with you !
3291,"hi , do you like football ?"
3292,"i do , i dont follow too closely though , you ?"
3293,i love football . did you know iowa painted the opposing team locker room pink ?
3294,"i heard about that . personally , i think its a bit childish , but whatever works for them"
3295,"i think so too . in the 1960's , the top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars ."
3296,"that is shocking , i wonder what the pay was back then ? i didnt realize bowling was ever that popular ."
3297,i never realized that either . pretty amazing .
3298,"it really is , but not as amazing as benjarvus greenellis , who have never fumbled the football ."
3299,that's pretty amazing and hard to do as a running back .
3300,"yeah , of course he was on the patriots too"
3301,of course lol . the highest score ever in a football game was 2220 .
3302,wow ! i cant believe one team could score that many points !
3303,i know . i bet that was a very boring game to watch !
3304,not if you were a ga tech fan . lol
3305,lol very true . did you know an average nfl game is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay ?
3306,"yeah , that sees so little for the amount of time it takes to actually watch a game ."
3307,for sure . the nfl uses tracking chips embedded is shoulder pads .
3308,i heard the ball has them too ! that is so cool !
3309,"very cool . they track ball speed , location , velocity , and rotation ."
3310,i hope they can use that data to also improve player safety .
3311,"i hope so too . well , it was good chatting with you !"
3312,i enjoy the nfl . how about yourself ?
3313,i love watching it ! i watch all 17 weeks during the regular season .
3314,i agree . did you know that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are actually higher than that of an nfl player ?
3315,i did not . but it makes sense . there is only 1 left handed qb in the nfl kellan moore .
3316,i'm surprised there are not more but since you mentioned it i do not recall seeing a qb throw left handed .
3317,i can only remember michael vick being a left handed qb . i'm sure there were some more at some point .
3318,i forgot he was left handed . did you hear about the sexist policy the saints have towards their cheerleaders ?
3319,i didn't . tell me more about it ?
3320,"they are forbidden from eating at the same establishments as players . if the cheerleader was there first and already eating and a player enters , they have to stop eating and leave ."
3321,i wonder if we will see a female player any time soon . there is no written rule against them playing in the nfl .
3322,i had heard that . it would be difficult with a lot of positions because of the size of the players but i see no reason why we have not had a female kicker .
3323,i agree ! did you know that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
3324,wow ! that seems like very little . i knew there were a lot more commercials and setting up and reviewing plays than gameplay but that is an extremely small amount of time .
3325,i know . that's what i thought . did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf qb so that the other team couldn't see his hand signals ?
3326,i did not . i would think it would be very hard to be a deaf qb . you would not be able to hear play changes or calls in your helmet .
3327,hahaha right ! baker mayfield almost quit football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career . i would never do that .
3328,that seems like a bad idea in the middle of your career . if he stays good though he has a second career ahead of him and that's always a good idea .
3329,i agree . are you familiar with the qb alex smith ?
3330,i am . i was sad to see him so severely injured .
3331,i agree . i think he will be back in time for next season . i was suprised at how educated he is . he took so many ap tests in high school it allowed him to enter college as a junior . he then got his bachelor's degree in 2 years !
3332,what a smart man . i'm glad to hear that because it means he can have a great career in other fields if he so chooses after football .
3333,are you a fan of the nfl ?
3334,"i am , the bears in particular . are you ?"
3335,"i love the bears , doing big things !"
3336,yeah . i am fearful we are just resting on our laurels though . we didn't sign a big free agent . what do you think ? ?
3337,"i think coming back from last year to this year , we will be solid . do you follow college football at all ?"
3338,i do . do you ?
3339,"i do also , i love the iowa hawkeyes , have you heard about their locker room for opposing teams ?"
3340,"no , what's with it ?"
3341,they painted it pink . pink has a natural calming effect and relaxes you . i bet that is why they win some big games at home
3342,they always beat my illini . but that's not a difficult feat . i do like how they wave to the children's hospital .
3343,"yea , sorry about your illini , maybe next year ? i like the wave also . talking about the nfl though , do you know there is no rule against having female players"
3344,i did not know that . do you think they would be successful in the nfl ?
3345,"personally i don't think so , maybe a kicker would be a good start . your thoughts ?"
3346,i do not think the american public is ready to see them in a physical sport . i think kicking is a good start .
3347,"that is a good point . it wouldn't be bad though , there is only like 11 minutes of actual gameplay they would need to watch"
3348,"yeah . i don't want to come accross as sexist so if it is something a female player wants and is ready for , im all for it ."
3349,"for sure i am with you . speaking of sexist , did you hear the rule against saints cheerleaders ?"
3350,"no , what was it ?"
3351,"if they are at a restaurant and the players come , they need to leave . interesting for sure . it was so nice chatting with a fellow bears fan !"
3352,ditto . have a great day !
3353,thanks enjoy your day also !
3354,hi how are you today ? do you like football ?
3355,"yes , i go to the games ! do you ? what do you think of baker mayfield ?"
3356,i have never been to a game . the tix are quite expensive . id love to go one day . what team do you like ?
3357,patriots and the bucanneers ! did you know there is no rules that women can play football in the nfl ?
3358,i guess if they have the strength and speed . ive never seen a woman like that though .
3359,i know maybe a kicker would be okay ! what teams do you watch ?
3360,a kicker ? maybe . can women kick as far a men ? i try to watch the playoffs so whatever teams are in the playoffs are the ones i watch .
3361,"oh i see , okay , thinking only if she's a very strong girl ! lol at least she wouldn't get hurt . did you know there is only one left handed quarterback ? kellan moore"
3362,that is an odd fact . i guess the lefties are unusual for a reason ? does the offense have to shift for a lefty ?
3363,"i guess not , a deaf quarterback created the huddle , so they couldn't read his hand signals ."
3364,that is a clever way to keep plays secret . he was an innovator .
3365,do you know who rb bejarvus greenellis is ?
3366,no i dont . is he famous ? rb is running back ?
3367,hes is so talented he has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
3368,that is a tremendous feat . he must be the only player like that ! does he have giant hands or something ? lol he should get a bonus .
3369,"lol , right ! have you played halo 3 ?"
3370,no i havent but i hear it is a challenging game . have you ?
3371,"very little , qb baker mayfield claims he can beat anyone at the university of oklahoma ."
3372,"he is probably quite good then . i have heard that you can make money at games now . anyway , great chat !"
3373,"yes , its been interesting ."
3374,thanks ! have a great day !
3375,you too ! good chat !
3376,are you a fan of either the redskins or cowboys ?
3377,i am a fan of neither . are you a fan ?
3378,i do like the cowboys and their running game will make things complicated for the redskins
3379,i guess that's a part of football that i will never understand . why run the ball when you can throw it oh so very far ?
3380,"well throwing the ball can result in an interception and if you have great rb then its better to ran the ball , its a safer play"
3381,"i guess that is true , but what is the running person bobbles the ball ? i've heard that bobbling is a big error in the football ."
3382,"yeah they can also fumble the ball , well if you have a rb like benjarvus green ellis then that wont happen"
3383,i guess he has big hands then ? does he wear special gloves ? he must be the best ball runner in the history of nfl ?
3384,"he must or had a magnet for footballs in his hands , and i think his one of the best , i think his one of the few if not the only one to never fumble the ball"
3385,he is a miracle man . he must teach his secret technique to the others .
3386,"he must yeah , share his knowledge with others , do you like the espn network ?"
3387,he could use the espn networks to share the knowledge ! that is the greatest of ideas ! he will be a hero to the many running men in the league !
3388,"he must be a role model to many rb out there , no doubt , and espn won an emmy because of football"
3389,"espn , is that the spanish network ? espanol or something ? i don't really speak spanish so i don't know them ."
3390,"not sure what it stands for , but its also popular in america , well they created the first down line"
3391,i guess the lines are important to the game . i figure the running man with the big hands carrying the ball can benefit greatly from the line of the first down .
3392,"yeah i share your point of view , did you know bowlers used to make more money than pro football players ! !"
3393,"i guess it is a way to a football career . start as a bowler , make the money , then become the football player . the ball is heavy in bowling so the hands get big for become the running ball man !"
3394,"yeah i guess thats a good idea , maybe bowlers also have tracking chips like in football"
3395,the bowlers use the tracking chips to find their way to the ball ? what are the tracking chips for ?
3396,"no , football is , to track the speed of the ball , rotation and other cool stats as well ."
3397,do you know much about football ?
3398,i know a little bit like how former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
3399,that is amazing . brady has totally changed the game for the patriots . it is crazy the charges that have been made against kraft the owner .
3400,i agree . how crazy is that ? espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow first down line on tv .
3401,i always wondered how that happened on tv . it always got my attention .
3402,do you know what the highest score ever was for a football game ?
3403,was it 2220 georgia tech ? that was a crazy game .
3404,correct ! in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars !
3405,who even watches bowling ? haha
3406,lol the university of iowa's visitors locker room is painted completely pink .
3407,i heard that before . i think it would only be for the other team . it's kind of sexist saying they are girlie . haha
3408,lol yes there is no written rule that prevents a female from playing in the nfl . lol maybe someday one will try to make it .
3409,maybe they were trying to attract females . lol .
3410,lol why not ? the more the better i say . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . short time for the big bucks they make off of the fans .
3411,it is amazing . since it goes on and on and on when you watch it on tv . sells a lot more beers that way .
3412,lol the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player .
3413,"plus , you don't have the medical bills as an engineer ."
3414,true ! didn't think of that . baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career . that would have been a crazy thing to do .
3415,he should have become an engineer . he would have been very wealthy .
3416,lol no doubt . do you have a favorite nfl team ?
3417,i guess the buccaneers since they are from here . i really don't watch much football . it used to be only so i knew if there would be traffic when i went to work . my job was only blocks from the stadium .
3418,nice ! mine is the steelers . well it's been fun chatting ! have a nice day !
3419,hi !
3420,hi there !
3421,"i had to giggle about junipero serra high school , who refused to start their back up qb despite failure after failure . that qb was tom brady !"
3422,that's too funny . are you excited about super bowl weekend ? not sure who to root for . was initially thinking the seahawks might make it this year .
3423,"i root for the team who is not the patriots , but they will probably win anyway . although for a while i was pumped that the colts were making a good drive . andrew luck had a careerhigh passes ."
3424,"ha ! i know what you mean . , did you read about that kid who did a science fair project that proved tom brady's a cheater ? , but yeah , andrew luck has a pretty good year considering his surgery ."
3425,i did read about the science fair kid ! ha ! brilliant ! luck has a strong defense to help the team as well .
3426,"marlon mack , also coming back form injury did a lot to help the colts out as well . man they had a good team this year ."
3427,it gives me hope for the future ! sure miss peyton haha ! i loved watching him . although there is really only 11 minutes of live game play on the average game . seems longer ! ha !
3428,"yeah , i read that . it's pretty amazing that it's only 11 minutes . but just taking a look at the super bowl , it does seem like more commercials than anything else . wonder what the first super bowl was like . think that was in 1966 ."
3429,the commercials are a show of their own !
3430,"yeah , but you know what i find interesting during the game . call me a geek but i like that superimposed yellow line representing the 1st down ."
3431,yes ! that's the one espn won an emmy for creating !
3432,"heck yeah , they deserve an emmy for that . keeps me interested and focused . guess espn and the nfl need to find ways to keep viewers . all about the business or money i guess . gotta pay those athletes right ?"
3433,"it would be a riot if athletes didn't get paid . although back in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as even the biggest football stars . hard to believe , ha !"
3434,"yeah , weird . i had heard that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player . ha ! guess i can tell that to my daughter . not that she'd play in the nfl ."
3435,"right ! she could play if she wanted to though . she just has to meet the league's eligibility requirements ! i'm not sure what those are , but it probably includes being 300 pounds and 6 foot 5 ."
3436,"ha ! yeah , that's not in our family genes . she's more of a cheerleader type ."
3437,nothing wrong with that ! probably safer .
3438,"someone told me though , new orleans saints cheerleader aren't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player ."
3439,"i think you are right . if an nfl player walks in , the cheerleaders have to leave !"
3440,"hi , do you watch nfl ?"
3441,"hi ! yes , did you watch the recent superbowl game ?"
3442,"i did , the whole 11 minutes of gameplay"
3443,"i think that's how long actual game play is ! it was a very dull game in my opinion . i was ready for some action , like edge of seat tiebreaker but was a bit disappointed ."
3444,yeah as were most people . did you know women can play too ?
3445,"i think women can play , at least it's not against the nfl rules , but i have yet to think of any women who can meet the physical requirements for eligibility . do you know how many pounds you have to be at least in order to play ?"
3446,i have no idea maybe that is one of the reasons why they do not play
3447,"yeah , it could be . the nfl's actually the highest professional level of american football in the world , i don't think i've ever heard of them drafting players from other countries like they do for other sports ."
3448,that is true . did you know about thet rule that applies to new orleans cheerleaders ?
3449,"no , what's the rule for the new orleans cheerleaders ?"
3450,they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players
3451,"what ? ! there seems to be some gender disparity treatment with that rule . i think they should revisit that rule and change it , i wonder why that is , do you know ?"
3452,i have no idea but the worst part is of the cheerleader is eatingn they have to get up and leave
3453,"that's a little overboard , it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that there is something wrong with that rule . speaking of rocket scientist , matt patricia who is a coach in the nfl was actually a rock scientist before he started coaching for the nfl !"
3454,that is soo cool . good for her . the university of iowa's locker room is pink . i wonder why though
3455,"to remind the players to be tough and play tough ! i don't know , i'm just taking a wild guess since the nfl uses tracking chips to record the players every move on the field ."
3456,i have no idea . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
3457,"no who is that ? that is an odd first name though , i wonder if his nickname is ben or something because that is definitely not a common first name !"
3458,he is a former rb who never fumbled in his nfl career
3459,never fumbled ? that is an amazing feat ! that almost ties with the accomplishment of brad johnson who is the only quarterback in nfl history to throw a touchdown pass to himself !
3460,that is amazing indeed . nice chatting with you .
3461,do you like the nfl ?
3462,yes i do . did you know that women can play ?
3463,yes there is no written rule that would prevent them from doing so
3464,yeah as long as they meet the requirements they are good to go
3465,yes . did you know there are only 11 minutes of gameplay in a game ?
3466,yes and yet we are glued to the tv for hours watching one game
3467,true . engineers make more over the lifetime than football players
3468,true . did you hear of that rule for saints cheerleaders ?
3469,yes they are not allowed to eat in the same places as the players
3470,"yeah , and worst , they have to leave mid meal if the players walk in"
3471,yeah i think it is sexist and it really needs to go
3472,i agree . do you like brady ?
3473,i do . in high school he was a back up qb for his team
3474,yes and he was not started even when they were doing really bad
3475,yeah their loss do you like alex smith ?
3476,"yes he is a great player and super smart , finished college in two years"
3477,yes and started his masters before he was even picked in the draft
3478,yeah such a well rounded kid . do you know who invented the circular huddle ?
3479,yes that was paul hubbard who did not want the other team to understand his signing
3480,yeah smart one . nice chatting with you
3481,same here
3482,"hey there , do you watch nfl ?"
3483,"yes , i'm a fan of the kc chiefs . funny how these people pick odds . . ."
3484,did you know women can play too ?
3485,yep . it's just a matter of time before there is a woman playing like brady .
3486,"yeah , they have the right to play so it is a matter of making it to the team ."
3487,i think there has been a kicker ? maybe they will like the u . of iowa's pink locker room .
3488,yeah i guess . and the game is short only 11 minutes of play time after all
3489,i played in hs and there was a lot of down time . we had circular huddles like the pros with a lot of wasted time .
3490,yeah so true . yet it takes forever for the game to finish
3491,"things change , like in the 60s when bowlers made more that top football players ."
3492,that is true . did you hear about that rule for the new oorleans cheerleaders ?
3493,i remember something about that . . . they can't eat in the same place as the players i think .
3494,yeah and even if they are eating and the player walks in they have to leave
3495,that doesn't seem right . they are big and some are smart like alex smith . earned a bs in 2 years .
3496,i know he took so many ap tests . good for him
3497,"i studied engineering . it's hard to believe that , over time , engineers make more than nfl players ."
3498,yeah i guess not all of them make a lot of money . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
3499,didn't know that . i do know i probably can't touch the money brady makes . he's the 3rd most valuable qb per espn's rating .
3500,yeah and yet his wife makes way mor ethan him modelling
3501,yeah and models don't have to do all the stats like who's going to win at a fashion show .
3502,true . it was nice chatting with you
3503,"hey there , do you watch football ?"
3504,"hi ! i do watch football . . . i used to be a big st . louis rams fan , but since they moved to los angeles i am no longer a fan . i still play fantasy football every year , which keeps me engaged with the rest of the league . i also enjoy college football a lot too . how about you ?"
3505,yes not as much but i do watch the games from time to time . do you have a favorite player ?
3506,"my alltime favorite players were some of the rams old players like kurt warner , marshall faulk , and isaac bruce . nowadays , i really enjoy watching patrick mahomes play . he was my quarterback on my fantasy team so i saw many of his games and highlights . he is incredibly exciting and it's nice to see new young talent injected into the league . aaron rodgers is also very fun to watch , but unfortunately , i think his best may be behind him . how about you ? any favorite teams or players ?"
3507,i do not have any favorites per say since i am not a regular fan but i was reading that women can also play if they can qualify
3508,absolutely ! there are no rules that prevent women from being in the nfl . do you think a woman will ever play in the nfl ?
3509,i do not know we just might have to wait and see if any of them try to make the cut
3510,"i think the first time we see a woman play in the nfl will be as a kicker . kickers don't have to tackle and take hits like the rest of football players do . however , i could see a very strong woman actually attempt to play a different position ."
3511,"yeah me too , why not , there are very tough women out there . have you heard about the new orleans cheerleaders and that strange rule ?"
3512,"i feel like i've heard about it , but i can't remember the details . . . can you give me the rundown ?"
3513,"yeah , they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant with the players"
3514,"that's really weird . . . what is the reasoning behind this ? i will admit , the nfl is an extremely poor run ' organization . ' lots of corruption , dishonesty , and unethical behavior . teams , such as the new orleans saints are also pretty unethical ."
3515,"i really have no idea . and the worst is , if the players walk in and they cheerleaders are eating , they have to leave"
3516,"that is very degrading to the cheerleaders . it's not like there are safety concerns or anything . . . they're in a public place . i can understand they not wanting the players and cheerleaders alone together , but it seems like there is a very small chance of something bad happening . seems like the players just have a superiority complex ."
3517,yeah for sure . do you know how mych game play time there is in a game of football
3518,"if i remember correctly , each quarter is 15 minutes long and there are 4 quarters to a game . did you watch any of the super bowl last week ?"
3519,"yeah and apparently out of all that , there is only 11 minutes of active game play"
3520,"yeah , it's pretty pathetic , haha . there is a couple seconds of action and then several minutes of standing around . it can still be very exciting at times though ; much more than some other sports . baseball is pretty bad with a lack of action and lots of standing around ."
3521,"yes , very true . did you know nfl players make less money than engineers ?"
3522,"good , they don't deserve to make as much as engineers . engineers actually do something productive for society . nfl players play a game and then generally don't contribute much to society ."
3523,that is true . nice chatting with you .
3524,do you watch the nfl ?
3525,i do sometimes . how about you ?
3526,every week i try to watch . did you know that there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
3527,i know and that seems crazy knowing how long a game actually is .
3528,"yeah , it seems like they mostly stand around , but that might just be me ."
3529,another crazy thing is the saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in a restaurant with any nfl player . if they are already eating and players walk in they have to leave . that must be an old time rule .
3530,"it isn't that out of the ordinary of a policy , the redskins have the same one ."
3531,"i don't know it just doesn't seem fair , but what is cool is that there is no law prohibiting a woman from playing in the nfl if she meets requirements ."
3532,"yeah , there were players in high school . i wonder how people would react though if one got injured very badly ."
3533,and i am left handed and i find it pretty cool that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl .
3534,"yeah , that surprised me that there is only one left handed qb in the nfl ."
3535,hey it makes him unique and makes him stand out
3536,"yeah , i wonder if it is due to the offense having to adjust ."
3537,"some football stuff i find funny , like the university of iowa's visiting locker room being pink . they must hate being in there"
3538,"yeah , some it is funny . i think they do that to intimidate the opposing team ."
3539,they probably do . and did you know that benjarvus green ellis never fumbled a ball in his nfl career . that is awesome .
3540,wow ! no i didn't . he must have glue for hands !
3541,he must be hated by the opposing team for sure .
3542,i'm sure they've taken note of him . did you know that in the 60s bowlers made more than nfl players ?
3543,that seems crazy but you don't see a lot of bowling anymore . did you know the highest score in a football game was 2220 . how is that even possible .
3544,"no , that is shocking ! well nice chatting with you ?"
3545,hey do you like the redskins ? apparently they are looking to increase their defense because that is lacking right now
3546,"hi ! i do like the redsksins and you're right ! they do have a huge hole on the defensive line and sadly , their run defense ranked 32 in the league back in 2017 which is embarrassing ."
3547,yes that is embarrassing . how often do you watch the nfl by the way ? apparently their season runs for about 17 weeks which i didn't know
3548,it does from the beginning of september all the way to late december and then the playoffs begin after that ! i try to watch it all . how about you ?
3549,"i watch it sometimes . i'm very interested though in the super bowl mostly , and also do you think that we will ever see a female player in the nfl ?"
3550,"who knows honestly ? perhaps one day we will . after all , the league has come a long way since the first playoff game that was played on an 80 yard long dirt field inside of chicago stadium back in 1932 !"
3551,"that's crazy that's how they started ! i think we could see if you know player , i also wish we could see games that have more than only 11 minutes of live gameplay"
3552,"is that how long they last ? the games do seem to fly by , sadly . but i guess with the tracking chips they stick in the players' shoulder pads to record their every moves , it's really less to record , i suppose !"
3553,"yes those chips are interesting , they can actually track things like player speed and location , do you think they put tracking chips on the new orleans cheerleaders ?"
3554,"ha ! i honestly don't know ! so do you like football in general ? like high school football as well ? there's a stadium in allen , texas that actually seats 18k and cost 60 million to construct . . . and it's a high school stadium . can you believe that ?"
3555,"i know that seems weird to me , i don't know why a high school football team needs such an expensive stadium , do you know any engineers by the way ? on average they will make more their lifetime than an nfl player"
3556,"that's surprising really ! i guess it's due to engineers having longer careers , maybe . but i do know the highest paid over all us department of defense employees are football coaches of three service branch teams !"
3557,yes those coaches make a lot of money ! what do you think about the team that painted their opposing team's locker room paint ? you think that helped them out in the game
3558,"maybe so ? ha ! i also wonder if those massive us flags hanging at football stadiums that weighs over 1 , 100 pounds and costs 50k to make are a help as well !"
3559,"yeah those seem huge ! also huge is the difference between what professional bowlers make now and what professional football players make now , and that used to be reversed in the 60's where the bowlers would make twice as much as a football player"
3560,"that is sad . i wonder why that was ? i guess today , football is a more popular sport than bowling since 14 of the world's 25 biggest stadiums are all football stadiums in the us !"
3561,"yes i think it depends on how good the players are , in terms of how popular it is , for instance i really like the patriots and they have a running back who has never fumbled the ball before , that's amazing"
3562,really ? that's almost as unbelievable as hearing kellan moore is the only quarterback who's left handed in the league !
3563,"that is unbelievable ! i wonder if it gives him an advantage or not , i also love baker mayfield , he was almost a professional video game player kind of like me haha"
3564,"wow ! ha ! i'm sure he made the right choice , at least in terms of money for now ! speaking of quarterbacks , did you know brad johnson is the only qb in nfl history to throw a touchdown pass to himself ? that is amazing !"
3565,"it is amazing i need to see a video ! i also want to see a video of the deaf quarterback who invented the huddle , that's genius"
3566,i love football and the redskins are ranked fourth in the nfl total rushing yards . wow ! !
3567,i had no idea . were they that good ?
3568,"yes , it seems like they are having a pretty good start . the mobility of alex smith , the redskins quarterback , along with the play calls and schemes of coach gruden the team looks good ."
3569,they have graded poorly in runblocking . will that hurt them ?
3570,"well , that is a good point so i don't know . adrian peterson has been a huge playmaker for them ."
3571,alex smith has 48 rushing yards . is he a good running back ?
3572,alex smith is the quarterback for the redskins . he is a great player and can throw some bombs but then at other times be sort of a let down .
3573,is that because of the runn pass option ? seems like they should do that more ?
3574,"yes , he needs to use his legs more but as he gets older he doesn't run as much . he has more than 10 percent of the team's total rushing , like a runner . ha !"
3575,it sounds like smith ran with kansas city last year too . why did he switch teams ?
3576,ya never really know the truth about why people switch teams but comes down to performance i would guess . washington has deployed a readoption look with smith 16 times this season so he is a good fit for this team .
3577,is he the same alex smith that took a ton of ap classes and started college as a junior ?
3578,"yep , that's him ! he is a brilliant guy who was working on his masters degree when he was the first overall draft pick in 2005 . do you remember what school baker mayfield was from ?"
3579,i do not . who is he ?
3580,"he was the first round draft pick last year . oh , he is from oklahoma state university . he is the brown's quarterback ."
3581,it says that he wanted to be a gamer . is that football thing working out for him ?
3582,"i remember hearing that about him from different websites and bloggers . who would have thought it , ha . he has brought life to the nfl team the browns . they were horrible before him ."
3583,were they good this year then ? how many games did they win ?
3584,"oh man , i am not sure actually . but i do know that an average of 11 mins of live play in every game , is all that we have !"
3585,is kellen moore any good ? he is the only left handed qb
3586,"well , we will see ? that will be fun to watch and find out . see ya ."
3587,hi how are you ?
3588,im great do you like football ?
3589,yes i do ! do you ?
3590,"i do as well my favorite team is in the afc , what about yours ?"
3591,"i am a steeler fan , whats your team ?"
3592,"i like the patriots , i guess we are tied in superbowl winds as of a sunday ago ."
3593,boo ! haha did you know theres no written rules against females in the nfl ?
3594,"i didnt know about that , i guess its logical not to let them play , men tend to be a lot stronger and it wouldnt be fair"
3595,only thing i can see is if some beast soccer player wants to try out for a kicker position .
3596,"yeah that would be different and would be a great fit for the team for sure , i think football is a great sport 32 teams , 16 in each division and each of them with great players"
3597,did you know there is only an average of 11 minutes of live gameplay per game ?
3598,"i didnt , that doesnt seem like a lot , i guess ads take over the screem , whats your favorite position ?"
3599,"probably running back . i never played football , i was mostly into soccer . whats your favorite position ?"
3600,"i like the qb position , im guessing you know who tom brady is ?"
3601,"yea i obviously hate him , but unfortunately i cant doubt he is the best . funny that he never started on his high school team ."
3602,it is funny i guess the coach never knew what he had on the bench until years later when he saw him play .
3603,he probably felt like an idiot .
3604,"yea i agree its not common to have a hall of famer in your team and never use him , he did lose almost everygame that season"
3605,thats too funny . did you know there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
3606,really ? only one ? whats his name ?
3607,his name is kellan moore !
3608,"oh kellan moore , he is a great player , imagine being a football player and loosing by 222 points ? well that happened back in 1916 poor cumberland"
3609,they must have fallen asleep or something .
3610,"i agree , something was up in that game , football is a game with a lot of interesting facts and stats , you know espn won an emmy because of football"
3611,i did not know that . they deserve it !
3612,"i think they did , the yellow line has changed football forever , it sounds like something simple but its has change things for sure"
3613,seriously ! it was nice chatting with you if this ends ever !
3614,its been nice chatting as well
3615,have a great day !
3616,"you too bye , and good luck to the steelers this season"
3617,"hey , i just found out some interesting things about football"
3618,i am interested to hear what you have learned about football . did you also learn about football positions such as the quarterback ?
3619,"i did , they are the leader of the team and they line up behind the offensive line ."
3620,that's true ! you can also call them ' qb ' for short .
3621,did you know the reason they huddle was because there was a deaf quarterback and he didn't want them to read his hand signals .
3622,that is an interesting story ! i had not considered that deaf players could be so influential on the game . did you know that female players are also allowed in the nfl ?
3623,"no , that is very surprising ! but , i do know the use tracking chips in the shoulder pads to record the players ."
3624,that is very hightech ! especially given how little actual movement and gameplay occurs in a game of american football . i heard an average game only has 11 minutes of actual action occurring .
3625,"wow , 11 minutes of action that's not much . i did learn the locker room for the visiting football teams at university of iowa in pink ."
3626,"what a curious decor decision . if you think that's odd , did you know the new orleans saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat in the same place as the players , and have to leave if a player comes in ?"
3627,"you are kidding me ? i would be so pissed , i wonder if they would have to stop eating and just go . there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl do you know how it is ?"
3628,"yeah , it's kellan moore , right ?"
3629,you got it . what is the name of the guy that wanted to quit football to play video games ?
3630,i don't think i know that one . was it alex smith ? he seems like a nerdy sort based on all his education .
3631,"no , i remember now it he was from oklahoma baker mayfield . he that he was the halo 3 king ."
3632,thanks for letting me know . i've always thought it's interesting that there are several sports called ' football . '
3633,"i know right ? soccer , rugby and gaelic ."
3634,and most of them are all called just ' football ' in some parts of the world . i would be very confused in australia if someone asked me to join a game .
3635,"funny ! so , do you think it is true that the lifetime money earned by and engineer is higher the and nlf player ?"
3636,that surprises me given how much players make today . but did you know back in the 1960s football players only made as much as pro bowlers ?
3637,"no , i didn't that is so hard to imagine !"
3638,it would be interesting to compare what top players in different types of football earn
3639,hi are you a football fan ?
3640,yes i do . did you know that women can play in the nfl too ?
3641,i see that . the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink . wonder why ?
3642,yes me too probably it is supposed to have some effect on the other team
3643,in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of the day .
3644,yes i guess football was not that popular of a sport as bowling was back then
3645,you're right . do you know what the highest score ever was for a football game ?
3646,"yes that was 2220 , quite the game and do you know who was playing ?"
3647,whoa ! who was playing in that game ?
3648,it was georgia tech that beat cumberland in 1916
3649,what a blowout ! espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line that we now see on tv .
3650,yes to be honest it has made game watching much easier now
3651,i agree ! former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the football in his nfl career . impressive .
3652,"that sure is . alex smith also finished college in two years , and is a great player"
3653,that's impressive ! baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career . crazy if you ask me . lol
3654,i know right ? he still claims that he is great at halo 3 and can beat anyone at u of oklahoma
3655,nice ! an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . kind of short for a game they stretch out to 3 hours . lol
3656,yes it certainly feels like forever . do you know who invented the circular huddle ?
3657,was it a deaf qb named paul hubbard ? it's been good chatting
3658,"same here , have a good one"
3659,have a great day !
3660,"hello , the u of ia visiting football team's locker room is pink . talk about getting in their heads from the start ."
3661,that seems like a lot of work for such a prank . do you enjoy football ?
3662,i prefer high school football . i think it's silly that pro nfl players have tracking chips in their shoulder pads .
3663,i heard they were in the footballs too . i wonder why they don't use those for calls instead of just relying on reviews when they have that data ?
3664,"one would think . how would you feel about a female player , as there isn't a rule against it ?"
3665,i'm for it . many positions would probably be difficult because of the size of the players but i see no reason you could not have a female kicker .
3666,"many high schools have female kickers , many of them are soccer players . i think the saints rule of making the cheerleaders leave , if a player comes into the restaurant is archaic ."
3667,i heard about that . even if they were there first and already eating they have to get up and leave if a player enters . i find it sexist and disgusting frankly .
3668,"they really have a long way to come , before i would ever consider supporting them . it's interesting that in the 60's pro bowlers made more than football players ."
3669,really ? ! that's surprising . we are a long way from that . i don't even see bowling on tv anymore .
3670,"i don't think there are any bowling alleys in my area . i know i haven't seen one for a very long time . it must have been a slow or bad year , if espn won an emmy for that superimposed yellow line ."
3671,that was a great invention . can you imagine watching a game on tv without that line ?
3672,"actually , i can . lol , i don't watch games on t . v . i think it's amazing that the hand signals were created by a deaf quarterback . that was brilliant ."
3673,i would think that being a deaf qb would be very difficult . you couldn't hear play calls or changes in your helmet and you would think you would be more likely to take sacks .
3674,"his other senses would more than compensate for it though . i think it would be interesting . also , how weird is it , that there is only one lefty quarterback ?"
3675,really ? you would think there would be more but when i think about it i don't recall seeing a qb throw with their left hand .
3676,"as a lefty myself , that surprised me . is it true that nfl games only have 11 minutes of gameplay ?"
3677,"that seems like a shockingly low amount . i know there is a lot of time spent on commercials , penalties , reviews , and setting up plays but that's very little time ."
3678,"it sure is . baker mayfield actually wanted to be a pro gamer , and almost stopped playing football . that's crazy ."
3679,luckily if he's still good after he can start a second career . did you know that an engineer has larger lifetime earnings than an nfl or mlb player ?
3680,"he is good at halo 3 , lol . thank you for chatting with me , have a wonderful evening ."
3681,hello ! so do like football ?
3682,"i do , i'm a big bills fan ."
3683,"i don't follow the nfl much but yeah , i like the bills . was reading that josh allen"
3684,"their quarterback situation has always made me mad , but they've done good with josh allen in his rooking season ."
3685,"that's what i hear , it was looking like the bill's was considered the worst team of the season . not sure how that all worked out though , if it changed ."
3686,they weren't the worst with their 610 record . they ended up 3rd in their conference behind the patriots and dolphins . if they can make some moves this offseason to get some linemen to protect him and a receiver or two they'll be doing really good .
3687,"oh , that's great ! hopefully they can get everything set right . well i have heard allen is very talented but by drafting allen was a risk . sounds like they didn't do too bad at all ."
3688,"yeah it was a risk , they had already picked up a quarterback in the last draft and alot of fans were perturbed about it . i really wanted them to stick with tyrod taylor , who got them into the playoffs the year before , but they traded him to the cleveland browns ."
3689,"oh , that sucks . my guess is they will get their act together and get back to normal . so do you play football ?"
3690,"i did in high school , but now only on playstation ."
3691,"oh , that's cool . never been a football player type . i love basketball though . but i am female so not very smart to play football lol , although i heard the nfl has no problem with women playing as long as they meet requirements ."
3692,i wonder why no women have tried to play in the nfl . with the way some teams treat their cheerleaders i can see why they wouldn't want to .
3693,"exactly , i definitely wouldn't want to be a cheerleader for the saints . . . . can't even eat in the same restaurant as the team ."
3694,that is so unfair . even if they're already dining in the restaurant and a nfl player comes in they are required to leave . i wonder why ?
3695,"i think it is ridiculous lol , and i can't think of a reason for that . they probably want to talk shop and don't want anyone to hear them , not sure ."
3696,"i'm going to have to research this . i'm intrigued . i mean the players on play on average for 11 minutes , i'm sure the cheerleaders are more active than that . they should be held at higher regard ."
3697,i agree ! i was thinking of researching this rule too . that's not right and makes me wonder if that is the only team that does it . . . . or all of them .
3698,apparently it's league wide with ridiculous rules . that's horrible . did you know that average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player ?
3699,"seriously ? wow , never thought that could even be possible for anyone to make more money than an nfl player ! i did hear that in the 60's bowlers made twice the money as top football players , that's nuts"
3700,i'm guessing the average nfl player isn't in the league that long and most engineers don't retire until they're in their 60s .
3701,true ! the engineers work a lot of years so i can see that . but i thought football stars made millions ?
3702,"they do , the average pay is like 1 . 7m and the average length of career is around 3 years . i think engineers on average are around 100 , 000150 , 000 so i guess they can catch up once the nfl player is out of the league ."
3703,"wow , that's a lot of money . i bet being a qb makes more money i would think . well enjoy your football on your playstation ! it has been a great chat !"
3704,"i've enjoyed it too , i hope you have a great evening !"
3705,hi there . are you a fan of the nfl ?
3706,"yea , it's crazy how the redskins games had no lead changes"
3707,"i'm not really a redskins fan . i'm more into the cowboys , myself ."
3708,"i'm a giants fan but follow the division rivals anyway . we suck though , the giants haven't won a game in 2017 that they trailed in"
3709,did you know the nfl technically has no rule against a woman player ? i'm surprised there hasn't been one yet .
3710,"i never knew that , i did know kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl though"
3711,"or that tom brady's highschool jv team failed to ever score a touchdown , but never tried starting him since he was the backup ."
3712,that's pretty appalling . did you know tom brady's old defensive coordinator matt patricia was an actual rocket scientist ?
3713,"i did know that . he went to a pretty weird college , too , right ?"
3714,"yea , some college called rpi who are obsessed with pi"
3715,"it's funny he chose to start coaching , though coaching it pretty lucrative . it's more lucrative to become an engineer , though ."
3716,"maybe as a player but coaches make a lot , the highest paid dod employees are the football coaches"
3717,"i'm sure engineers still do better , i would imagine their careers last longer than a coach . did you know that top bowlers back in the 60s made twice as much as the top football players ?"
3718,"no , i had no idea but football has grown in popularity since then , the 14 largest stadiums in the world are for college football"
3719,"ugh , college football . everyone is obsessed with it . did you know the university of iowa painted their visitor team locker room pink ?"
3720,"lol yea . high school football gets too much attention too , in allen texas they spent 60 million to build a high school stadium"
3721,"that's a little aggressive ! who needs that nice of a stadium in high school ? it can't possibly raise that much in return , can it ?"
3722,"people in texas are pretty crazy about high school football . so is snoop dogg , he wrote a fight song for his son's team"
3723,"yeah , people in texas are super crazy for football . friday nights lights is based on a real culture !"
3724,"football and flags , the us flags at games weigh 1 , 100 lbs !"
3725,"and i think i remember them costing something like 50k ! anyway , it's been a good chat ! enjoy your day !"
3726,"how's it going , do you follow football ? did you know the qb usually touches the ball on almost every offensive play ?"
3727,did not know that . did you know brady was a back up qb in high school ?
3728,yea at junipero serra high school . it's pretty mindblowing his jv coach never started him despite the team never even scoring a touchdown
3729,"yeah , their loss i guess . did you know alex smith wrapped up college in two years ?"
3730,"yea , smith was a pretty smart student , able to start college as a junior from all the ap tests he passed"
3731,yes and then got started on his masters before he was picked on the 2005 draft
3732,smith sounds a lot smarter than baker mayfield . mayfield considered giving up millions playing football to be a competitive gamer
3733,yes he claims that he is super good at halo 3 and can beat anyone at u of oklahoma to it
3734,maybe left hander kellan moore could beat mayfield at some halo 3
3735,"could be , you never know . do you know who invented the circular huddle ?"
3736,"yea , paul d hubbard in order to prevent opposing teams from stealing his hand signals"
3737,yeah and he was deaf himself so that was genius on his behalf
3738,"that's pretty impressive , i wonder if the nfl will ever have female players since there is no rule preventing it"
3739,i wonder too . i do not think i have heard of anyone trying for it at least .
3740,"i've heard of female players at the high school level , but none that played college or in the nfl"
3741,yeah . did you know that there are only 11 minutes of active game play during a game ?
3742,no but that might help explain why an engineer makes more on average than an nfl player in their respective lifetimes
3743,good point . what do you think of that rule where saints cheerleaders cannot eat in the same place as the players ?
3744,"sounds pretty antiquated and sexist , i have no idea why the saints still enforce that rule"
3745,"i agree completely with you there . on a different note , they are using tracking chips on the players during games now"
3746,"that's pretty cool . well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
3747,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
3748,"i do , i love football , what about you ?"
3749,yeah me too . did you know women can also play if they meet the requirements ?
3750,"i didnt , it does seem unfair , football is a game of strengh and men tend to be stronger ."
3751,yeah i guess . but maybe everyone can last in a game with only 11 minutes of play time
3752,"that fact is a bit odd , only 11 minutes of gameplay ? thats not much , noth much at all"
3753,"yeah i know , pretty short . did you know engineers make more than football layers over their lifetime ?"
3754,"i didnt know that but it does make sense , engineers work for a long time football players have short careers ."
3755,yeah that is true . did you hear about that rule for the new orleans cheerleaders
3756,"i did , that rule is so unfair and sexist , i hate it , the saints should change that immediately ,"
3757,i agree there completely . the worst part of it is that they have to leave mid meal if the players walk in .
3758,"that is the worst part , did you hear about the tracking chips footballs have , ?"
3759,yeah i hope they can use that data like velocity and rotation to make the game a little safer too
3760,"that would be a great use of the data , football can be a risky game full with injuries , a lot of the players end up with brain damage"
3761,yeah exactly . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
3762,"i didnt , why did espn win an emmy award ? i though emmys were only for the music business i guess i was mistaken"
3763,"i thought so too , but they won it for the superimposed yellow line ."
3764,"i guess that was a really important contribution to the game not sure if it deserved an emmy though ,"
3765,yeah not sure either . do you know what the highest score in football is ?
3766,"no maybe 80 to 7 ? or 120 to 3 ? i have no idea , im just guessing here ,"
3767,"it was actually 2220 . i was mind blown , good for georgia tech"
3768,do you watch much football ?
3769,"i catch it when i can , mainly into college ball . how about you ?"
3770,i watch a little of pro ball but not a ton . college ball always seemed way more intense to me .
3771,"it does , i think it is because you are playing solely for pride ."
3772,so true . plus they can get away with fun stuff like silly pranks and not have the media in their face or huge fines .
3773,like painting a locker room pink . lol
3774,only in iowa i swear . speaking of college rivalries that one between their two college teams is crazy intense .
3775,really ? i guess you would have to be near it to know . here in florida uf and fsu can get pretty heated .
3776,that is the gators and the seminoles right ?
3777,"yeah . i went to fsu so i am a bit invested , but honestly dont care too much ."
3778,i'm hoping that the nfl shares some of the chip tech with college teams so we can get more data about hits and ball spin . i really like the math and science side of it .
3779,it is fascinating indeed i think it could be used to prevent injury too and develop better safety equipment .
3780,it would be great if they could use that data to make helmets better to avoid concussion injuries .
3781,i think they have started some work on things like that with the placement of the inner padding .
3782,now if we can also get rid of the horrible attitudes towards cheerleaders on some teams it would be golden .
3783,that would be great ! i cant blame females for not running at the chance to play in the nfl with they way the treat the cheerleaders .
3784,i can't even imagine trying out . technically they could but i bet the coaches would make it hard as possible for them to make it .
3785,"very true , the requirements might be prohibitive themselves ."
3786,at least they aren't throwing them out because some male players show up . those poor new orleans cheerleaders . i can't imagine putting up with that .
3787,i wonder if it is like that all around the league ?
3788,it seems like it depends on the team . i'm sure that there is probably a reason for it but it seems super sexist . especially in this day and age .
3789,for real . i dont know what could have happened to spur a rule like that .
3790,who knows . probably some scandal between a qb and a cheerleader . it always seems to be the qb in trouble .
3791,"it does , but then there are some like alex smith who just lead the charge and stick around to get a masters ."
3792,i think it is amazing when they stay in college instead of just depending on a pro career . shows really forward thinking and plan for when football is no longer an option .
3793,"it does , so many players go broke 5 years after they retire , something like 60 percent"
3794,wow that seems crazy to me because you think they make all this money but it is only for those few years so most jobs actually bring in more .
3795,"like being an engineer you will make more in a lifetime , you have to work longer , but you make a lot more overall ."
3796,makes sense to get that degree then . well it has been nice talking to you . have a good evening .
3797,hey what do you think about dj moore ? how good do you think he is ?
3798,i haven't seen or heard too much about him . hes up with washington right ?
3799,"yes he is , he is a wide receiver . and he normally works well with the quarterback kyle lauletta , they play at the cole field house by the way"
3800,wow . i think it is great that there are a bunch of good up and coming players .
3801,"yes i agree , they definitely got a good draft last year , what do you think about the nfl in general by the way , how often do you watch it"
3802,"i dont watch too much , there is only 11 minutes of live action . i dont have time to spend 3 hours watching a game for 11 minutes ."
3803,"nope i agree . that's why i don't like sports because i think that they are really boring personally . on the other hand though , what do you think about females playing for the nfl"
3804,"they dont treat cheerleaders well , so i dont imagine that they would treat female players well either ."
3805,"no i agree with you . i think it's really dumb how a female cheerleader would have to leave restaurant if a male player walked inside , that seems very dated"
3806,"it really does , i wonder why that rule exists , or if it is even enforeced ."
3807,"i think it is enforced unfortunately , do you know any engineers by the way ? apparently an engineer will make more over their lifetime then a professional nfl or nba player which is incredible to me"
3808,"i know few . none that are paid that highly , but it is cool that engineers have that earning potential ."
3809,yup thats cool ! what do you think about the team that painted their locker room pink ?
3810,i think it is a bit childish and in a way toxic .
3811,yes i agree . i wonder if they did better or worse after they painted it that color ? what do you think about the patriots player who's never fumbled the ball ? he sounds amazing
3812,it is leaders like him and brady that really make that team what it is . i doubt anyone else will ever be able to do that .
3813,yep it takes a special person to be that good . it also takes a special team to set a record for the most points scored in a football game lol did you hear about that game
3814,"yeah , it is hard to believe . how can you even score that many 222 , that explains why the other team had 0"
3815,"yep they must have been so good , georgia tech was definitely on their game that day"
3816,cumberland must have forgotten to get off the bus . . lol
3817,"yep that's certainly possible ! or they should have used the one player from the patriots who's never fumbled the ball , he would have definitely helped cumberland to do better that day"
3818,football seems to just be increasing in popularity in the us . do you follow much of the games ?
3819,"i do , i just watched the superbowl on sunday and like the game , do you like it ?"
3820,i don't follow it too much . i am more of hockey fan . is there a lot of teams in the nfl ?
3821,"yeah there are 32 teams in the nfl and there are two divisions as well , 16 in each"
3822,it doesn't seem like there is a lot of actual game play when you watch a football game . there seems to be a lot of talking and standing around then a few minutes of intense play .
3823,yeah there is a stat that says that a game has only about 11 minutes of gameplay i guess the rest is just ads or time wasting .
3824,it seems like they play a lot of ads . i wonder how much of that money goes to the teams and then the players . they seem to have quite the high salaries if you look at their lifestyles .
3825,"im not sure as most players end up backrupt of with financial problems , you know the nfl uses chips to track players movements and to get interesting stats of the game ."
3826,like they put chips in the uniforms ? that is really neat . it would be cool to have a camera in the helmets to see the gameplay from the perspective of the players .
3827,"yeah they put chips under the shoulderpads of players and it would be cool , that is a great idea , the football also has a chip"
3828,that's awesome . i wonder if they ever include that info in the sports broadcasts that they do during and after the games .
3829,"i guess its a possibility , theres a lot of money in football , and the game has evolved since the first playoff game back in 1932"
3830,the halftime shows and all the cheerleading certainly has . it is almost like a concert when you go to a professional game now .
3831,"i agree , those have become really popular as well and move a lot of money , stadiums tend to be really expensive ."
3832,i heard that it raises the taxes exorbitantly when they build a new stadium . i wonder if any of the ad money for those sponsers goes to the community or just to line the pockets of the owners .
3833,"i can imagine , in texas there is a stadium that costed 60 million dollars , that sure is a lot of money ! and in american we have 14 of the 25 biggest stadiums in the world ."
3834,wow that is crazy to me for a sport that has such a short season . especially one that is played during the most volatile weather seasons . don't some states have outdoor stadiums ?
3835,"yeah some states do , but im guessing the construction is still heavy , flags at football stadiums are also really expensive like 50000 each"
3836,wow that seems really excessive for just a flag . i get that it has to stand up to the elements but good grief ! no wonder things are so expensive when you go to a game .
3837,"yeah i guess that makes a lot of sense now , they also weight like 1100 pounds so not only are they expensive but they are really heavy as well , probably a good thing since it cant get stolen that easily"
3838,i can't imagine wanting to steal one of those but i'm sure there are people out there that would think it is funny .
3839,do you watch football ?
3840,"i used to , i dont watch the nfl anymore after all of the kneeling and protesting"
3841,"nice , did you know that kellan moore is the only left handed qb ?"
3842,"yeah , hard to believe kellan moore is the only lefty ."
3843,i don't follow him that closely .
3844,did you know that the nfl has no written rule against female players ?
3845,"yeah , i can believe it ."
3846,nfl using tracking chips to track ball velocity and rotation .
3847,interesting . i've never thought of something like that .
3848,"how about the rule that tells new orleans saints cheerleaders they are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as players . if a player comes in , they have to leave ."
3849,i think all the clubs have something like that though . the redskins do too .
3850,i don't know that i would listen to that rule if i was dealing with it .
3851,yeah . i wouldn't listen to the rule . none of the redskins did either .
3852,if the average nfl game only has on average 11 minutes of live gameplay ? why does it take all of sunday afternoon to watch a couple of games ?
3853,they stand around and make play calls .
3854,which nfl team do you follow ? i used to follow the broncos and the bucs
3855,the redskins .
3856,are there still people trying to get them to change their name ?
3857,"probably , every year they do that . never ends . i remember chris cooley married a cheerleader and they made a big stink about it . that's why i say all teams have this rule ."
3858,yeah they wont be happy until that name is gone .
3859,it won't ever change . nobody in dc will let that happen . nice chatting with you .
3860,sam darnold's professional football career got off to a great start against detroit . 2 td passes in a 4817 win .
3861,do you remember sam darnold well ?
3862,"yes , this is his first season in professional football , and he plays with the ny jets ."
3863,what position did he played ?
3864,"darnold plays quarterback . his first pass was intercepted for a touchdown . after that , he played great ."
3865,"he was the youngest to start the season , what was his age ?"
3866,"he is only 21 years old , that's the youngest qb to start a season opener since the aflnfl merger ."
3867,"did he retire or what happened , i heard of him but don't remember him ."
3868,"no , 2018 is his first year . if he is successful , he could play well into the 2030's ."
3869,"oh wow , i am a nfl fan and didn't know that ."
3870,"on the first week of the season , tampa quarterback ryan fitzpatrick also had a fantastic game ."
3871,"if you had to chose , which of the two would you say better quarterback ?"
3872,"fitzpatrick is better today . we will have to see how much darnold improves . a good start doesn't always mean a long , successful career ."
3873,"that true , if you was a coach , and your team about to enter the superbowl , would you pick darnold's as your starting quarterback ?"
3874,"some qb's who had good starts have done well , newton , palmer , wentz , . others have been busts , griffin , ramsey , weinke , ."
3875,"yes , you are right . did he play for the jets in 2018 ?"
3876,"yes , darnold played for the ny jets ."
3877,did you like the jets before they got eliminated from the playoff ?
3878,the jets did play poorly this year . here's an odd fact about another nfl rookie qb . baker mayfield once considered pursuing professional egaming as a career .
3879,"yes , most of their games were close . i thought that they would have made the playoff , i don't know what went wrong ."
3880,the jets simply weren't a good football team this year .
3881,hello do you like football ?
3882,not so much . . . are you a big fan of football yourself ?
3883,"not really . i hardly watch anymore , sometimes if the 49ers play ."
3884,quarterbacks are one of the most popular players for football it seems . i cannot name any off the top of my head though . can you ?
3885,"tom brady , eli manning , joe montana , alex smith . those last 2 arent current lol"
3886,"i think it's interesting that matt patricia is a coach for football but yet he is also a rocket scientist . really , how does he have time for football ?"
3887,maybe it pays better lol
3888,that would make my day if i learned football would be a more lucrative profession than rocket scientist . what is the world coming to ?
3889,"i know right . i would rather be a rocket scientist though , i dont want to be costantly injured lol"
3890,that's true . . . although coaches and owners seem to be in the permanent safe zone ! did you know that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's football team ?
3891,"thats cool , i wonder if it was any good lol"
3892,"well , that football team is one of the luckiest around to be involved with snoop dogg . i don't think they needed to do much fundraising for equipment at that school !"
3893,i hear the former running back of the patriots never fumbled the ball benjarvus greenellis .
3894,wow a football player that never fumbles the ball ? that sounds like some sort of football god . is he a quarterback ?
3895,"running back . not a quarter back . i know right , really impressive , i wonder why this guy isnt more well known ."
3896,"running back , quarterback , tight end . those are about the only football positions i know . . . the last one sounds pretty funny , actually ."
3897,"i dont know many either , only the common ones . espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow line that tells you where there is a first down ."
3898,"even as hard as they try , in football or any other sport it can be hard to call . there is always human error . differences of opinion , too , i bet . . ."
3899,i recently read that the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback .
3900,"was that so the football players on the other team or other people couldn't see what the quarterback was signing ? that's very clever , if so !"
3901,"it doesnt go into detail but yeah i assume so , very smart of them and also awesome to accomodate a deaf quarterback ."
3902,good morning ! cool . . . love talking national football league !
3903,hey there . yes the nfl is an awesome organization . i watch the super bowl this year it was held on the first sunday in february . but it wasn't that good of a game i thought .
3904,"i like defensive games . i didn't watch it for the first time because i was protesting how the new orleans saints were screwed by the officials . but , that's me . . ."
3905,yeah that was one of the worst no calls i have ever seen . truly terrible . nfl uses tracking chips and players shoulder pads but they can't even review a call ? not ok .
3906,"yep . . . . i don't know if you've been watching any alliance of football games , but they have a referee on camera that's supposed to catch a lot of those callls . i hope the national football league brings that same approach to the games ."
3907,yeah i definitely think the nfl should adopt that . they have no written rule against female players so why not have a referee on camera too .
3908,"agreed . i'm glad that jacksonville is finally going to get rid of blake bortles with that philly qb , can't remember his name , . they should be a lot better with him ."
3909,yeah i agree with you there . i remember the former patriots running back green ellis he never once fumbled the football .
3910,"he was good . strange he didn't last long with the patriots . but , they also say in the afc east that sam darnold looked good at qb , but i think baker mayfield was better for my team , the browns , . we finally have a quarterback ."
3911,i hope your team does well in the future you guys definitely deserve it . i am also glad baker mayfield didn't pursue his competitive gaming dream . he makes a better football player i think .
3912,"yes , we are very excited about baker mayfield at quarterback . the cleveland browns have been so pitiful for so many years . we have 21 year old kids that don't even know we ever had a good team ?"
3913,yeah well hopefully that will change lol . sometimes i forget that there are 32 teams in the nfl because we only hear about the same teams every year .
3914,"if i have to hear the new england patriots name one more time , i'm gonna barf ! i hate that they are the one football team that are in the playoffs every dang year . uggh !"
3915,i know it is very annoying . i really wish they didn't win the super bowl again . i would've really like to see the new orleans saints win this year .
3916,"agreed . and that's why i didn't watch it for the first time ever . i was under protest , lol . . . then again , i did bet on the pats to win ,"
3917,well it was a smart bet and i hope it paid off for you . it's kind of interesting that the new orleans saints cheerleaders can't be at the same restaurant as any nfl player .
3918,probably a good idea . . . . lol . . . . . cheerleaders are the last thing a national football league player needs to see when trying to concentrate on football . those gals are too gorgeous !
3919,i completely agree with you . sometimes i would rather watch them in the game . surprisingly though the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player .
3920,"well , i'm glad they do ! engineers deserve more money than a sports player in baseball or the national football league ."
3921,yeah i agree with you . the football players just get injured too often which is surprising because there's actually only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game .
3922,"yep ! well , i'd like to keep talking football with ya . but , i'd better get going . great chatting with you and would like to do it again . . . . you take care now and have a great day !"
3923,do you watch football ?
3924,i sure do . snoop dogg once wrote a song for his son's team
3925,wow cool . u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
3926,i wonder if that is supposed to have some impact on them
3927,i wonder too . bowlers made more than football players in the 60s
3928,wow cool . the coaches are the highest paid ever though in the states
3929,i bet . do you know what the highest college football score is ?
3930,"i am not sure , what game was that ?"
3931,"it was georgia tech and cumberland , 2220"
3932,wow what a score . did you know kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl ?
3933,cool . do you like brady ?
3934,"i like him , he is good . do you know brad johnson ?"
3935,i have heard of him . brady was a backup qb in high school
3936,wow a backup ? brad is the only guy to have thrown himself a touchdown ball
3937,wow i did not know that was even possible
3938,me either . only two africanamerican players have won the superbowl
3939,wow . baker mayfield wanted to be a game player originally
3940,wow . did you know the nfl is using tracking chips now ?
3941,cool what for ? what are they collecting there ?
3942,they are collecting velocity and rotation and a bunch of other stuff
3943,"oh i see , can they use that to make the game safer too ?"
3944,do you follow the nfl ? the la chargers lost to the broncos 2322 last week to win the afc conference .
3945,"hello , no i didn't . you keep up with football a lot ?"
3946,not really . i prefer watching the band ! but some fun facts about football are that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are more than the average nfl player and mlb player .
3947,"i read that too crazy ! nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
3948,that is way too much for me ! the huddle was created for american football when a deaf quarterback didn't want to give away hand signals
3949,that's really considerate !
3950,in the 60's top bowlers actually made two times the amount as top football stars
3951,"maybe bowling was much more popular back then . matt patricia is the only rocket scientist coaching in the nfl . before coaching , he was a working aeronautical engineer who graduated from rpi : a school whose fight song includes ' sin ' , ' cosine ' and ' tangent ' , as well as six digits of pi ."
3952,smart guy ! i wonder if he visited the pink univ of iowa college football locker room
3953,"lol must be some sort of strategy or something ,"
3954,espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games . that is cool !
3955,"yeah ! the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80yard long dirt field inside chicago stadium , then home to the nhl blackhawks ."
3956,there was a patriot football player named greenellis who never fumbled the football . i guess they should pass to him !
3957,"nice , i wonder why that guy isn't that popular , never heard of him ."
3958,not sure . the highest scoring game racked up 222 points and the other team unfortunately got 0 when georgia tech won over cumberland .
3959,wow ! snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team .
3960,alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he went in as a junior to college .
3961,"wow that's impressive ! those humungous american flags at football stadiums weigh 1 , 100 pounds and cost 50 , 000 to make"
3962,that's huge ! arizona is apparently doing worse in scoring than predicted for football .
3963,that's unfortunate . 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams .
3964,"i wonder if public or private ? i guess i may be funding them ! better go watch some football : ,"
3965,i didnt know there was navy football as well
3966,there seems to be a league for everything
3967,"i agree , i wonder if navy football is any good , seems like its really competitive"
3968,there seems to be an official governing body so it seems quite proffesional .
3969,"it does seem that way , theres different teams like the midshipmen , seems like they have still chance to win the tournament"
3970,i did not even know the quarter back was classed as an offensive player .
3971,it does make sense sinse they are behind the offensive line and only participate in offensive plays
3972,its strange that cheerleaders are required to leave if a player enters a resturant it seems an outdated concept .
3973,"that is a terrible rule , the saints are a sexist team"
3974,but there are no rules against women playing in the nfl
3975,no rules agaisnt that really ?
3976,i wonder how strict the requirements are and if any women try .
3977,they must be really strict .
3978,have you ever seen the data from the trackers ?
3979,"no , i havent what about you ? it might be interesting though , all kinds of data"
3980,"i dont follow football , but its interesting to know an engineer has better earning potential than a football player ."
3981,"well thats because they work for a lot more years than a football players , foorball players usually retire at age 40 or so"
3982,i bet the engineers body will be in better shape as well
3983,"yeah and with a better brain function , many pro football players end up with terrible injuries or braind damage , in some cases both"
3984,"that is bad , but i was also suprised to know that an average live gameplay is only 11 minutes"
3985,"only 11 minutes ! that seems like a scam ,"
3986,they say it's time to stop sleeping on the chargers . what do you think ?
3987,"kansas city ? they had a good 2018 season , didn't they ?"
3988,"los angeles charger's had a 83 season . they say they should have a definitive shot at the super bowl this year , what do you think ?"
3989,"they didn't make it to the super bowl . don't know how close they came , do you ?"
3990,out of the thirty two teams they are one that did not . the chargers have made the play offs 6 times .
3991,that's a solid record . the la rams got the spotlight ; guess the chargers have been overlooked . who are their star players ?
3992,good question ! you know the iowa university locker room is painted pink for the visitors .
3993,fun college football fact ! do you have a fav . college or nfl team ?
3994,well it use to be green bay but i don't get to watch sports much anymore so i always just hope for a good game when i do .
3995,packers . bret favre . remember those great teams well . used to never miss vikings or green bay games ! what makes a good game for you ?
3996,"great plays , fair calls and strong defense . how about you ? another fun fact top bowlers in the 60's made more than top nfl players did ."
3997,heard that . fair calls : well said ! vikings used to pride themselves on defense . great plays makes me think of the qb . was favre your favorite ?
3998,"through the years but he's up there with the greats , montana , elway and some of the other's . how was your favorite ?"
3999,"have to say tom brady , but his jv football coach would not agree . jv team lost every game , and never scored a td . brady as backup qb sat sidelined ; coach never put the kid in a game ! hasn't brady's career changed since then ? ?"
4000,so very very much . he's got a bunch of rings and they just won this years super bowl . plus i heard he wrote a book .
4001,"6 super bowl rings now , all with ne and coach belichik . brady has written a book ; some call it a kind of football ' bible ' . he is very serious , almost religious , about commitment to the game . i'm suspicious of that kind of fervor . . . how about you ?"
4002,well not the fervor but what i'm hearing about him and this book gives me pause . apparently there is a degree about bill that states in bill we trust and some call his book a little cultist .
4003,"yes , have read about that . the patriot fans can be pretty ' faithful ' to their team . jees ! football is meant to be about passing , kicking balls and scoring td , field goals , etc . it's a sport , not a religion , don't you think ?"
4004,i agree 100 percent too much credence is placed on the wrong things . hey did you hear about espn's emmy award ?
4005,"yes , the one they won years ago for creating that superimposed yellow line on the field that shows viewers how many yards the offensive has to go to get a 1st down ? so used to it now , i can't picture watching a game without it ! but somebody created it ."
4006,"yeah it made watching the game that much less frustrating , lol ! you know that if you are a new orleans cheerleader and you are eating at a restaurant and a player comes in then you have to leave . i think that's kind of sexist . well it was nice chatting with you !"
4007,"will leave you w or a thought from my dad , who coached hs football for 41 yrs : his fav . thing was to watch fervent boys run up the field in the wrong direction ; what he hated most was that boys wouldn't report injuries to him . they wanted so badly to keep playing . good chat . cheers !"
4008,you too mate !
4009,give her watch high school football ? apparently gonzaga and st john's are in the top 20 now
4010,does gonzaga play quarterback for st johns ?
4011,"i think gonzaga is a team , but i'm not 100 percent sure i don't follow high school football that much , i only watched a local game when my nephew is playing lol"
4012,i see . then you probably know i do not watch high school football ! i really don't even watch the nfl . do you ?
4013,"no i don't watch the nfl either . i do like tom brady though , that's the only thing i know is that he's really good lol"
4014,i hear that ruby is a variation of football . it's even literally called rugby football in places .
4015,yes i think you're right . i only like american football though . they also have gaelic football and canadian football
4016,"sorry , meant rugby , not ruby ! i hear some of the stadiums have flags that weigh over half a ton . i wonder if they've ever fallen ?"
4017,yeah i would be so scared if i saw that flag falling on top of me lol . did you ever hear about the highest scoring football game of all time ?
4018,"i didn't , was it a very high score ? i know it's a high price to build a football stadium . i've heard just a high school one can be sixty million !"
4019,wow that's insane ! you think that a high school team does not need a football stadium that complex . did you know that in the 60s top bowlers made more than top football players though ?
4020,"i like bowling more than playing football . one reason is that i like how you can practice alone because for football it's always teamwork , but bowling can be done alone ."
4021,yes i agree . it's also a lot less work to get a team together lol . what do you think about espn winning an emmy for the yellow line on tv ?
4022,"i guess it's a good idea , but i'm not sure if it was the best . i agree that schools spend too much on elaborate stadiums . out of the 25 largest stadiums in the world , 14 are at american colleges . i wonder what their food is like ?"
4023,"yes i'm curious too . i'm also curious why the university of iowa painted a locker room pink , i wonder if they thought it would help or hurt them"
4024,"i think they did it for just a joke , or i hope so . i know snoop dogg has a son that plays football . have you ever seen him play ?"
4025,"no i haven't seen him play . the song he made is really interesting though , you should look it up on youtube"
4026,"i haven't heard it , i will ! i think quarterbacks tend to be popular players in football , although i'm not even sure what they do ."
4027,"yes quarterbacks are the ones that touch the ball the most and also throw it to other players , baker mayfield is one of the most famous ones"
4028,"i've heard that kellan moore is a famous quarterback in the nfl known for being left handed . he's the only one like that , it seems ."
4029,"yes you're right . he's very talented too , baker mayfield though played this video game called halo 3 back when he was in college , he was unstoppable at that game , i was also really good at it too lol"
4030,hello do you like watching football ?
4031,"i love football , the eagles are my team !"
4032,"awesome . they won the 2018 super bowl . i don't really know a lot about football or sports in general , though ."
4033,"they sure did , that was one of the happiest moments of my life !"
4034,was that their first super bowl win ?
4035,"yes , they had never won until that year , that is what made it so special !"
4036,cool who did they play against .
4037,"they played against the new england patriots , who lost to the gints twice in the 2000s , they are not so great anymore though !"
4038,i guess not ! i found it interesting to learn that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
4039,"that is true , it is very strecthed out , but the eagles won in fantastic style , they added new players like ajayi and darby who helped win"
4040,"it looks like they added quite a few new players , like torrey smith and patrick robinson ."
4041,"yes , and they are both gone now , the nfl moves very quickly !"
4042,they didn't stay long . did they move to new teams ? i know they make a lot of money in the nfl .
4043,"yes , some players use that superbowl as a chance to improve their value and worth . blount also left the team , and he had won the year before that"
4044,are you looking forward to seeing what the team does this year ?
4045,"we have a shot at the playoffs , but many players are injured like clement , barnett and darby are injured , and that makes it tough to win"
4046,"yeah , i bet . injuries probably happen a lot in football ."
4047,"they do , it is partially why the giants collapsed this year , as well as the redskins"
4048,well it was nice talking to you even though i don't know a lot about football !
4049,"you as well . it is an interesting sport , there is a lot of nuance to it"
4050,goodbye
4051,do you like the nfl ?
4052,i love it . did you know women can play too ?
4053,yes there is no rule on paper that prevents them from playing
4054,yeah if they meet the requirements they are good to play
4055,yeah . do you know how much gameplay is there in a game ?
4056,yes it is actually only 11 minutes in total
4057,and yet we are glued to the tv for hours to an end
4058,yeah i know . did you hear of the rule for the saints cheerleaders ?
4059,yes they are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players
4060,yeah and they also have to leave mid meal if they walk in
4061,"so sexist , i really think it needs to go"
4062,i agree did you hear they are using chips on the players now
4063,yes they are tracking stuff like velocity and rotation and such
4064,i hope they can use that to make the game safer somehow
4065,yeah . do you like brady ?
4066,i do . he was a back up qb in high school
4067,yeah and they did not start him even when they were not doing well
4068,yeah their loss . do you like alex smith ?
4069,"i do . he is a good player and a super smart kid , finished college in two year"
4070,yes took lots of ap tests in college and managed to do that
4071,yes good planning . nice chatting with you
4072,"hey there , do you watch nfl ?"
4073,"hello there , i do follow the nfl , did you watch the superbowl this year ?"
4074,"part of it , how about you ?"
4075,"yeah i kind of fell asleep at the end , but i woke up and saw i had won some money so i was happy . do you have a favorite nfl team ?"
4076,i do not have a favorite one . how about you ? i like that they have no rule against woman who can also play in the nfl ?
4077,"yeah i think that is super cool , i really want a female player to make a team and play and the field soon . i think it would be so great for all the young girls into sports . and i follow the packers ."
4078,"yeah , i mean even the locker room for university of iowa players was pink ."
4079,yeah isn't that hilarious . i wonder how they got the ok for that to get painted in the first place .
4080,yeah i wonder too . in the sixties top bowlers made twise as much as football players .
4081,"that is so funny , oh if i could have a choice to do it again , i would be a top bowler in the 60's . i would have the life then ."
4082,yes so true . did you know that espn once won an emmy ?
4083,yeah i heard they won it years back when they came out with the yellow line shown for the first down line .
4084,that is so interesting . the highest score in football was scored when gerogia defeated cumberland .
4085,wasn't it a crazy score of over 2000 ? i think i read about that one time .
4086,yeah that is truly crazy . a former patriots rb never fubled the football in his nfl career .
4087,"i heard that . what was his name , i don't remember but know he played for the patriots ."
4088,his name was benjarvus greenellis . pretty interesting .
4089,yeah that is amazing . do you know when the first nfl playoff game was held ?
4090,no i do not know that . do you ?
4091,"it was way back in 1932 ! in chicago stadium , and the field was basically dirt and only 80 yards long . it was the same place the blackhawks played !"
4092,oh wow it has been around for so long . it was nice chatting with you .
4093,are you watching the superbowl this year ? wouldnt it be interesting to see a woman play for either team .
4094,"i'll probably watch it . are you ? you know , the nfl doesn't have any rules against a woman playing ."
4095,"yeah i just found about that though i dont we will ever see one at a pro level , i also didnt know the average game play is 11 minutes"
4096,"i didn't know that either . next game i'm going to watch to see if that is true . i do know , though , that there is only 16 regular season games ."
4097,"really only 16 thought there were more games , so anyway whats your favorite football position ?"
4098,"well , there is if you count playoffs and preseason . oh , and each time has a bye week . my favorite position is either quarterback or wide receiver . you ?"
4099,"mine is runningback , its been my favorite since i saw benjarvus greenellis play , so much talent ."
4100,"i've never heard of him . i'm old school and have to admit that my favorite running back was tony dorsett back in the day . but now , as far as talent goes , there's some good players out there . baker mayfield for example . he's so talented at stuff he could even do professional video game playing !"
4101,"yeah i know who mayfield is , he is talented i heard he was pretty good at halo back in college ."
4102,yep . i like multifaceted players . alex smith for example is reported to be very smart . he was working on a master's degree before being drafted .
4103,"wow , i guess he is one of the few football players with a masters degree , that is admirable ."
4104,"i think so too . football can be inspiring like that . i mean , tom brady was a second string quarterback in high school and now look !"
4105,"i bet his coach didnt think he would get so far , his been in almost every superbowl since 2002"
4106,i agree . i wonder what will happen with the patriots when he retires . the quarterback is the leader of the team and they don't seem to have a good replacement in place .
4107,"i know , the qb is so influential that he touches the ball in every play , they are going to have a hard time finding a good replacement , not sure how the second string qb is right now ."
4108,"knowing that , teams need really good quarterbacks . did you know that kellan moore is the only left handed one ?"
4109,"i didnt know that , football sure is a nice sport , there are many crazy stats like the one in which georgia tech defeated another team by 222 points"
4110,that is crazy ! i would have loved to see that game ! i bet neither team had any defense at all !
4111,"yeah , or the other team was probably full with blind people ."
4112,maybe the home team should have tried to psych their opponent out like the university of iowa does . they have the visitors locker room painted pink .
4113,yeah that can certainly demoralize a team .
4114,do you know who baker mayfield is ?
4115,i'm not sure if i do .
4116,"he is a quarterback , he used to play for the redskins and now is preparing for the senior bowl"
4117,"oh , okay . i love the game of football , although i find it odd that the nfl has no written rule against female players ."
4118,theres no written rule really ? i wonder if well ever see a female player then
4119,"well , we might . as long as a female can meet league eligibility requirements , she is free to play ."
4120,"great maybe some day , did you hear about those tracking chips the nfl use ? amazing how much the game has grown over the years"
4121,"yes , i've heard the nfl uses the chips in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field ."
4122,"i think thats intersting , they use it to track their position and then they also place the chips on the footballs and all kids of interesting stats are pulled from them"
4123,well then i guess they can really hold the players accountable for how they are playing and also make some really good plans too .
4124,i agree so did you hear about the rule the saints have against cheerleaders in their team ?
4125,"yes ! it sounds completely sexist to me . i can not imagine being at a place eating as a cheerleader , having a player walk in , and having to get up and leave without finishing my meal !"
4126,"i kwow right , having to walk away would be humiliating specially if you are with friends and family , humiliating and totally unfair"
4127,i agree . seems dated . can you believe that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of an nfl player ?
4128,"that actually make sense , most players have a carreer of 20 years and then enginneers work for 40 years or even more"
4129,"well , yes . i'm not sure which career i'd like better . it would be nice to have the nfl perks , that's for sure ."
4130,yeah but then theres are all the injuries associated with the game and the brain damage
4131,"well , yeah , that is a drawback . even top bowlers in the 1960's made twice as much as top football stars . i think i'd rather bowl !"
4132,"i like bowling , it seems like a safer game not a lot of room for injuries , well bowlers make a lot less now"
4133,yes . i'm sure they still make better money than a 95 though . they have to be talented though . like former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the fb in his nfl career !
4134,"i have to google that like right now , he never flumbled the ball ? wow , anyways its been great chatting with you i feel lot smarter now"
4135,"no , never in his career ! nice chatting with you as well ."
4136,"im googling that for sure seems unreal , thanks for all bye ."
4137,hey how are you ? you watch the nfl at all ?
4138,"yes i am a real nfl fan , i try to watch most games ."
4139,"right on , you a ravens fan by chance ? or you like another team ?"
4140,"the ravens is pretty good , but i like the pittsburgh steelers , even though they aren't a come from behind team ."
4141,"oh man , i'm sorry you're a steelers fan lol . antonio brown and le'veon bell gone in a year ?"
4142,"that's what i am thinking about , but that always been my team , they do need better players , they seems to fall everytime against a good team like new england ."
4143,"true , juju smithschuster and james conner are both special players too , even if they only play for 11 minutes throughout the game ."
4144,do you actually believe that a four quarter game only 11 minutes of live plays ?
4145,"i could maybe see that , i thought it'd be a lot less to be honest . if we're just talking about from snap to whistle . what do you think ?"
4146,"i would say no way , including quarterback time , run time , field goal time , it almost takes the average person 11 minutes to enjoy a nice dinner' just my opinion ."
4147,"haha for sure , i think it's just between the whistles though right . like a fg would start when the ball is snapped and end when the whistle is blown , so like 5 seconds ? it'd be interesting to see the way they came up with that stat ."
4148,"i would agree with that , what do you think about women in the nfl , do you think the ratings will drop to a low ?"
4149,"not sure , if they can keep up that would be cool to see , i just don't see it happening anytime soon , what do you think ?"
4150,"i am not trying to be negative , but i don't see it either , because it would be hard to find a 250 to 300lbs player hitting a woman head on , i can't see that happening ."
4151,"true , maybe as a kicker or punter sometime ? i don't know who would really want to play in the nfl anyways . alex smith is pretty smart too , took a lot of ap tests in high school"
4152,"that's true , i would be upset if i play the nfl pool and a player let another player run by and make a touch down just because she's a woman ."
4153,"true , i could see that . how much did juniperro serria hs regret not playing tom brady ?"
4154,"wow , i bet he still regret it , did you know in 1961 georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 ? i never heard of cumberland , have you ?"
4155,"i have not , they're in georgia though i'd assume right ? they probably shut down the school after that game haha ."
4156,"hahaha , they probably did , because i pretty sure they most have fired the coach . i didn't know kellan moore is the only left hand in the nfl ."
4157,"for sure , i wonder why he was the only one . i'm going to take off though , take care and great chat !"
4158,hi ! do you like football ?
4159,hi . yes i do . i especially like american football . do you ?
4160,i'm not that big of a fan . i did find it interesting that there is only one left handed qb in the nfl
4161,that is interesting . another interesting fact is that the huddle was started because of a deaf quarterback .
4162,that's very interesting ! the junipero serra high school had such a bad year they failed to even score a touchdown .
4163,i think i've heard of them before . during that year wasn't their starting quarterback tom brady ?
4164,"actually , he was their backup . they never played him !"
4165,that's right ! he was the backup . he's been a starter for so long now i just automatically said it lol ! have you heard of baker mayfield before ?
4166,"yeah , i have heard the name but i don't know much about him ."
4167,he was the starting quarterback for the university of oklahoma . word is he's not only great at football but also at video games . he's so good he considered becoming a professional gamer .
4168,that's cool . do you know who alex smith is ?
4169,his name sounds familiar . isn't he a professional quarterback too ?
4170,"yes , and he's smart . he earned his bachelor's degree in 2 years and got his masters before becoming the first pick in 2005 draft"
4171,"wow ! that is impressive ! good for him ! he must have worked very hard in school . i mean , quarterbacks touch the ball for practically every offensive play so you know he was busy with football and to still do so great academically is fantastic ."
4172,no doubt ! i wonder if he every played iowa in college . their visitor's locker room is pink !
4173,"that's funny . i guess that school has a good sense of humor . speaking of schools , have you heard of georgia tech ?"
4174,i have heard of them . i'm guessing they have a good team ?
4175,"not sure if they do now , but back in 1916 they did . they scored the most points ever in a game . they beat cumberland 2220 ."
4176,"wow , that's quite a thumping ! could you imagine being on the losing side of that game ?"
4177,i would feel awful . that bad of a beating would probably make me highly consider quitting playing . i can't help but wonder though why they just didn't call the game at some point .
4178,i totally agree . great chat ! have a good one !
4179,"hi there ! looking forward to chat with you ! ; ,"
4180,"you too brah . do you watch football ? the nfl has 32 teams , the ny giants are my favorite team"
4181,"i don't really watch . . . i'm from europe we watch football , soccer , ; , giants huh ? where you're from ? all my neighbors are cheering for giants ; ,"
4182,"i'm from connecticut , right next to ny . we don't have any of the 16 teams from the nfc or afc in my state unfortunately"
4183,"ahh , i'm from long island ny , so i guess we're neighbors ; ,"
4184,i wonder if european football uses tracking chips like how the nfl embeds them into shoulder pads
4185,"yeah i don't think so ; , i mean , i've never heard about that . i wonder what's the point . . ."
4186,"i guess the nfl uses them to track the players movements and they also have them in the ball to track velocity , rotation , speed , and location"
4187,"holy crap , so much data for running with the ball and passing it from time to time . . . : , hey i heard that the highest score in football was 2220 ? is that really high ?"
4188,"usually in the pros once you break into the 40s its consider really high , in college there will be a game once in a while that breaks into the 60's or 70s"
4189,what . . . so how the hell did they do that ? 222 ? that's like 4 times bigger score than that . . .
4190,"yea , it must of been the best team in college football at the time facing another college that's team had the skill equivalent of a high school team"
4191,are matches like that entertaining to watch ? soccer matches are really exciting even with score 00
4192,"if the games are close in score they tend to fun to watch , if it's onesided and you're not a fan of the high scoring team then no , that's why i don't really like college football 90 percent of the games aren't competitive"
4193,i see . . . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars was bowling that popular in usa ?
4194,"not really , back in the 60s football wasn't as popular and there was no unions , players during the offseason worked regular job"
4195,"ahh , ok . . . hey what's up with those pink locker rooms in university of iowa's ? did you hear about that ?"
4196,head games i guess . did you know 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams ?
4197,probably huge budget stands behind it . . . that's why it's also so popular . . .
4198,"yea , kinda a shame sports are more important than academics , the highest paid across all u . s . department of defense employees are three football coaches of the service branch teams ."
4199,"i agree , but it was always like that . . . entertainment above all whatever brings more profit . . . hey , it was really nice chatting with you !"
4200,"you too , have a good one"
4201,are you familiar with college footballs ?
4202,"hello , actually more familiar with the nfl"
4203,"me too . so , why are quarterbacks so important ?"
4204,the are very very important because the are the leaders of the offensive team
4205,do they really make calls during huddles ? i thought coaches do those .
4206,"it looks like that is the way ! well and we are getting close to the superbowl , how you like that ?"
4207,i am going to watch superbowl on tv .
4208,me too ! did you know there is a crazy rules for the new orleans saints cheerleaders ?
4209,no i don't . please tell me about it .
4210,the can't eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player !
4211,"i just read about , after you mentioned it , . what is the reason for that ?"
4212,"i think that makes no sense , i the cheerleader is already eating there , an a player comes in , they have to leave . i do not think there is a valid reason ."
4213,is it legal ? it is discrimination . i think the cheerleaders should stay if they are there before players .
4214,i totally agree with you . and at least the nfl has no rule against female players .
4215,i heard about that . no female player has been interested in joining the nfl so far .
4216,if a woman wanted and met the requirements she could get in but i doubt it would happen anytime soon .
4217,i agree with you . do you know that nfl places chips in players shoulders pads ?
4218,"yes , i heard something about it ! tell me more"
4219,the league wants to know the players' each move on the field .
4220,"we enjoy the game so much , but did you know how much is actually actual play time ?"
4221,"no . please tell me about it . also , who do you think will win the superbowl ?"
4222,"just 11 minutes , we will just wait and see . it was a pleasure talking to you !"
4223,hey ! how's it going ? do you like football ?
4224,yes i do . . . very much ! do you ?
4225,"i do , what do you think about baker mayfield ?"
4226,he seems pretty good so far ! who's you're favorite team out the 32 teams in the nfl ?
4227,"i'm a new orleans saints fan myself , how about you ?"
4228,that's cool . . . i like them . . . although payton's faces are pretty funny ! i am an eagles fan .
4229,"yeah they are . i like the eagles too , there's been a lot of good players come through there ."
4230,yeah . . . be nice to have a consistent quarterback ! i can't believe kellen moore is the only left handed qb !
4231,i can't either . i find that odd . i guess the last quarterback i knew of in the league was tim tebow .
4232,so i wonder when we will see a female player in the nfl ?
4233,"i'm not sure , i'm surprised there hasn't been one since there's no rule against it ."
4234,so true ! what position you think she will play ?
4235,i'm not sure . i could see a defensive back or something .
4236,i was thinking more like a kicker .
4237,that would work too . i would just hope they would get treated better than the cheerleaders . the saint's cheerleaders are forbidden from eating at the same restaurant as any nfl player .
4238,crazy isn ; t it ? you ever heard of that before being a saints fan ?
4239,"i had not , it's pretty horrible . even if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , they have to leave . that is crazy to me !"
4240,extremely unfair . . . they need to change that rule . . . it's very rude !
4241,i agree they do . the game has changed so much in the nfl . in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top nfl stars . now i'm sure that's reversed tenfold .
4242,oh yeah . . . for sure ! how about we sit around for 3 hours watching a game for only 11 total minutes of live gameplay . . . we muct be crazy !
4243,"i know right ! i can't believe it ! well i have to run , it was nice chatting with you . i hope you have a good night !"
4244,hi ! are you a football fan ?
4245,yeah i loe football how bout you .
4246,"i watch more college than the nfl , but yes i am ."
4247,i dont watch much college other than the mountaineers every now and then . im a big steelers fan so i watch them every week .
4248,"i watch fsu and sadly i grew up a dolphins fan , so there is no hope there . lol"
4249,lol . as long as you pick a team and stick with them . i hate it when somebody just goes with a team just cause they are doing well .
4250,"yeah , not a fair weather fan . i would stick by my team even if they were losing by 222 . like the highest scoring game ever ."
4251,"that would be emberrasing to lose by that much , but i would still stick with them as well ."
4252,it is more embarrassing on how the saints treat their cheerleaders in my opinion .
4253,yeah i read that to . that is rediculous .
4254,in the 60's nfl stars werent making as much so their egos probably werent as big .
4255,"i know right . if bowlers are making more than you are , i dont think you can get to big of a head on your shoulders . lol ."
4256,"i cant even name 1 professional bowler , ever ."
4257,me either . i just think of that movie with woody harrelson . i think it wcup or something like that . it also as tin
4258,kingpin ? that is the one i think of .
4259,yeah that might be it . lol . brings back memories .
4260,"yuo . a time before that yellow line , that espn won an emmy for . lol"
4261,well that yellow line is prettyawesome if you ask me .
4262,"i totally agree , i dont know how to watch without it . its just not the same ."
4263,nope . it really give you a new perspective . you can physically see where we need to get to . when a guy stretches out you get to make a judgement on the spot whether he got it or not . love it .
4264,did you know there is only 1 left handed qb in the nfl ?
4265,i didnt know that actually . i figured there would be at least a few . good chat though ttyl .
4266,"how's it going , are you a football fan ? it's amazing benjarvus greenellis never fumbled in his career"
4267,he was a graet player he used to play for the patriots right ?
4268,yea and i believe he may of played for one of the other 32 teams in the nfl
4269,"i wonder if he ever won a superbowl with the team , i guess he played with brady ,"
4270,i think he did . it's crazy that brady never started for his jv team despite them never winning a game
4271,"so much talent wasted , the coach made a terrible decision ! i bet he was teased for that years later"
4272,"hopefully he no coaches at junipero serra high school , not only did they not win a game they didn't even score a touchdown"
4273,"wow his high school coach must be like the worse coach in the history of the game lol , he had a legend on the bench , he is a 4 or 5 time super bowl winner i bet he could handle a high school game"
4274,"alex smith also went to high school in ca , not only was he a good qb he was a smart student who passed a bunch of ap tests"
4275,"yeah i hear he got his ba in just two years and then began on his masters degree , i wonder if theres a phd as well"
4276,well alex smith did begin working on his master's degree before he was drafted into the nfl
4277,i think thats great many players wont study and then they will end with deep financial problems after their carreers are over
4278,"i don't think baker mayfield did too much studying , he plays a lot of video games when he's not playing football"
4279,he considered becoming a pro video game player once right ?
4280,"mayfield did , he claims he can beat anyone at halo"
4281,"he and i must have a halo contest then , i am a great halo player one of the best"
4282,i wonder if the nfl would use tracking chips to record mayfield and you playing halo
4283,"i would have no problem with that as long as i get a shot to defeat mayfield , he wont see me coming"
4284,"good luck with that , i hope the match would be longer than the 11 minutes of live gameplay a nfl game averages"
4285,"11 minutes doesnt seem like a lot , specially when each quarter is 15 min long"
4286,"well i have to go , nice chatting with you"
4287,hello ! how are you today ?
4288,doing well thanks . how about you ?
4289,i'm going great as well ! do you like football ?
4290,i follow it some . do you think there will ever be a women playing in the nfl ?
4291,maybe as a kicker to start with ! more and more girls are getting into it which is awesome ! what do you think ?
4292,"i think there will be , i'm all for it if they can do it . did you know the average nfl game only has 11 minute of live action ?"
4293,"that's great ! i didn't know that , it's too funny though because we waste 3 hours watching it haha ."
4294,"yeah , and also think about how many hours of practice they go through for just 11 minutes ."
4295,i agree ! i bet the 1916 game that was 2220 took more than 11 minutes of gameplay lol .
4296,i'm sure . i can't believe they didn't stop that game .
4297,i would have just walked off the field lol . i wonder if they were in a trance because of a pink locker room like the iowa hawkeyes do ?
4298,maybe . if i was on the team that had their locker room painted i would retaliate by shutting off the hawkeyes hot water .
4299,haha that would be a nice revenge measure ! would you rather have been a bowler or a football player in the 1960s ?
4300,in the 60's i would have rather been a football player . today i have more sense . how about you ?
4301,i would have been a bowler because they were paid much more than football players !
4302,i can see your point . what do you think about the tracking chips the nfl uses ?
4303,i think it is great because it records a players every move on the field . i wonder what they do with the footballs !
4304,"well , tom brady could how many times the football rotated and then let some air out ."
4305,"haha i'm sure he somehow ' lost ' the chips on that football haha . i see his jv high school football team was terrible , but they never put him in !"
4306,"ha , right . i have to give brady credit , no matter what else he has had quite a career ."
4307,"he really did . it was nice chatting , have a great day !"
4308,"i don't keep up with individual players much , but the nfl gains a lot of attention when it's not in the 17 weeks of the regular season"
4309,"yeah it does , i know it still has the highest tv ratings of all of our major sports ."
4310,i wonder how much more popular it would be if there were a female player . there's technically no rule against that happening
4311,i think that would be so cool if a female player did make a pro team . to young girls into sports it would be huge as well .
4312,can you believe each game is only really eleven minutes of live gameplay
4313,"isn't that pretty crazy , doesn't seem like anything , but there are tons of stops in the game ."
4314,"still , that seems so short . i wonder how they used to keep track of all the stats before they had chips embedded in the footballs and shoulder pads . then again , people weren't as obsessed with fantasy football before all the technology"
4315,that is true and there wasn't nearly the amount of focus and attention to injuries as there are now . especially all of the stuff on concussions .
4316,also true . it can be risky even now . i'm not sure if all the money is worth it if engineers can make more money over a lifetime
4317,"yeah i think when you add it up those engineers make more because they work for a much longer time , but i could be wrong ."
4318,that's probably also true . the work is likely more steady and requires less moving unless you're as good as tom brady and can stay with the same team over a long period of time
4319,i wonder how many years tom has left in him . i would say he has won enough .
4320,who knows ? maybe he likes being the leader of the offensive team
4321,"speaking of football , do you know what the highest scoring game ever was ?"
4322,wasn't it when georgia tech played against cumberland ?
4323,"good call ! yeah it sounds like the defense didn't show up that at all , or the offense i guess ."
4324,maybe georgia tech had a good rb . greenellis never fumbled the ball during his nfl career
4325,"that is some stat , to be a pro running back and never had a fumble , that is impressive ."
4326,very true . the visitor's lockers at the university of iowa are painted pink . i wonder whose idea that was
4327,that is pretty funny that whoever is in charge at that school gave the ok for them to paint it that way .
4328,true ! i wonder if the other variations of football have funny traditions like american football does . i'm sure rugby players have similar stories
4329,"hey , how's it going ? are you a big football fan ? i'm not the biggest fan , tbh but i find a lot little facts about it fascinating . ."
4330,"i love watching football , my favorite teams are the iowa hawkeyes and minnesota vikings ! do you have a favorite team of the 32 nfl teams ?"
4331,"i wouldn't say i have a favorite , per se , but i like some of the quirks of certain teams . for instance , do you know university of iowa's visitor's locker room is painted pink ? ha , i find that funny !"
4332,"of course i do , they do it for psychology purposes , it tends to be a calming color"
4333,yeah colors have different effects on people . i remember in high school reading about an experiment where they painted a weight lifting room pink and they found the people in there couldn't lift as much weight !
4334,"wow i need to read up on that , that is amazing what a color can do lol . have you heard of alex smith ?"
4335,name sounds familiar but i don't recognize it offhand . . .
4336,he was the 1 pick in 2005 as a quarterback . he got his college degree his sophomore year of college because he was so smart
4337,"wow , that's amazing ! really helps break the stereotype of jocks not being that bright . speaking of quarterbacks , this one fellow baker mayfield considered quitting football to pursue competitive video gaming ."
4338,"i heard that too , i think halo 3 was his game . i could beat him one on one !"
4339,"dunno . . . i think i'd stick with football then use the video games as a backup . then again , you're less likely to be injured playing video games , so i dunno . . . ."
4340,"for sure , no one plays halo 3 much anymore , the game is like 15 years old already ha"
4341,did you know the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback ?
4342,"i think i knew that back in the day , paul hubbard i think was the quarterback . look what he started , i wonder why they huddled"
4343,"yeah , he didn't want to risk anyone reading his hand signals and knowing what they were up to ."
4344,"that is smart . do you know any lefty quarterbacks in the nfl , apparently kellen moore is the only one right now ."
4345,"i haven't heard of any to honest . speaking of which , do you think a woman could play football ? there's technically no rules in the nfl against it , so long as they meet the eligibility requirements ."
4346,"that would be interesting to see . i would watch that if it happened , it would be legendary"
4347,"speaking of legendary the biggest score ever in a football came was 1916 . georgia tech defeated cumberland with a whooping 2220 . wow , get the feeling somebody wasn't even trying that night . . ."
4348,that would have been so crazy to watch . i would have quit after the score got to 1000 . there should have been a mercy rule
4349,"well , listen , it's been awesome talking to you ! you have a terrific day !"
4350,"you too , have a great day !"
4351,hey are you an nfl fan ? i am and i like to speculate about next season . one hot topic is whether dez bryant is still elite . what do you think ?
4352,i'm not a big fan don't know a lot about football . i know he is a player for the cowboys .
4353,oh thats too bad . yeah football can be a tough game . an nfl game only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay isn't that odd ?
4354,yeah that is odd . also odd that new orleans saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as an nfl player . very strange .
4355,yeah i have heard that . i don't like that ruleapparently they are worried about the cheerleaders distracting the player . football wasn't always popular thoughin the 1960's pro bowlers made more money than football players !
4356,wow that's really surprising . i know they bring in the money now . even though an engineer still earns more in a lifetime than an nfl or mlb player on average .
4357,"yeah thats a great pointbecause the nfl career is so shorttoo many injuries , no longevity . did you know the nfl uses chips in the players shoulder pads to track their movements on the fieldprobably to make sure they don't kneel lol ."
4358,haha yeah and they track the football itself too !
4359,oh interesting . no wonder they have so many interesting statistics ! do you think there will ever be a woman nfl player ? they are allowed to play you know .
4360,yeah i was kind of surprised to learn that . i'm sure it will come up at some point . i wonder if it hasn't happened yet because women aren't aware of this or because they fail to meet league eligibility requirements .
4361,probably because they are smart and don't want to trash their brain and body lol . but i think there is a woman player who is becoming very closeshe is one of the best players in recent years i saw on espn . i don't remember what position though .
4362,yeah it can definitely do some damage playing football .
4363,definitely . but football players definitely know how to live large and have fun . the university of iowas locker room painted their visiting teams locker room pink .
4364,that's something i would like to see . i guess that is supposed to mess with the opposing team before the game haha
4365,"yeah i bet it works ! one exciting thing to watch during an nfl game is when a player fumbles , but former patriots running back greenellis never fumbled in his life ! crazy ."
4366,that's pretty impressive . also interesting that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl .
4367,"yeah totally agree . interesting because in some sports like tennis it can be an advantage , but apparently not in the nfl ."
4368,"also pretty interesting that the circular huddle was created by hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team couldn't read his hand signals . pretty smart and the huddle has stuck with the sport ."
4369,that is very interesting . i always wondered about that . it is funny how certain behaviors and acts just stick over time and no one questions where they originated .
4370,yes that is very true . well it has been nice talking to you .
4371,you too . have a great day !
4372,goodbye .
4373,hello do you like football ?
4374,"i do , what about you ? i'm a huge redskins fan ."
4375,"i dont follow it much , if i do watch it , its only cuz the 49ers are playing lol i like the niners , but they havent been doing well in awhile lol"
4376,"nice , did you know the nfl uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads to record their move on the field ?"
4377,"yeah thats pretty interesting , i believe they put it in the football as well ."
4378,really ? what do they do with the data ?
4379,"probably use it for stats , not sure exactly or"
4380,"interesting . well apparently matt patricia is a rocket scientist , so maybe he knows !"
4381,"yes , maybe they use it for rockets ! ! lol did you know there is no written rule about females playing in the nfl , like technically women can play !"
4382,"yeah , i'm not sure that people would want to see them get injured on tv though ."
4383,"i dont want to see anyone get injured on tv , but they still do it lol"
4384,"yeah , this is true . did you know there is only 1 left handed qb in the nfl ?"
4385,yeah thats a interesting fact .
4386,"yeah , it is . apparently it is kellan moore , he is pretty good , right or"
4387,"i have no clue , i never heard of him . do you know the patriots ? they used to have a player that never fumbled the ball in his career ."
4388,"yeah , they just won the super bowl , did you watch it ?"
4389,"no , i didnt watch it , i went snowboarding instead lol"
4390,hilarious . did you know snoop dog wrote a fight song for his son's high school team ?
4391,that sounds pretty cool . i wonder if it was any good lol
4392,i bet it's a different sound than his current music ! are you a fan of snoop dog ?
4393,yeah i know a lot of his songs .
4394,"nice , i haven't heard any of his new stuff , but hopefully he is still good . anyways , nice chatting with you ."
4395,do you like football ?
4396,"i kind of hate it , but it seems like i'm a minority in that respect amongst americans . i think i like rugby better haha ."
4397,"i dont follow rugby that much but it seems like a great sport , gaelic football is new to me , first time hearing about that variation of the sport"
4398,i think any variation is more efficient than american football . did you know that there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay in the course of an average nfl game ?
4399,"only 11 minutes ? wow , that seems unfair to fans and to viewers of the game ,"
4400,"well , there are 17 weeks of the regular season , plus the playoffs , so i guess it adds up ! people just watch the super bowl for the commercials anyway ."
4401,"yeah , i guess commercials are pretty good . did you watch this years super bowl ?"
4402,i did not . maybe i'd watch if women playedthere's actually no official rule against it !
4403,"that would be interesting , you know top bowlers made more money than football players back in the 60s"
4404,"i wonder if that applied to female bowlers , too . did you know that an engineer actually has a higher average lifetime earnings than a typical nfl player ?"
4405,"i didnt know that no , that seems a bit unreal considering how much pro football players make"
4406,"well , their careers are pretty brief , although some players like tom brady last a pretty long time , and he was backup qb of his high school jv team ."
4407,"he is 40 years old and still the icon of his team , and really he was ? wow ? so much talent wasted on the bench"
4408,"well , some qbs have other interests , too , like schoolfor example , alex smith entered college as a junior because he had so much credit from all the ap courses he took in high school ."
4409,"sounds like he is a really smart qb , not only a great player but smart guy"
4410,"yes . another qb who was good at other stuff is oklahoma's baker mayfield , who considered quitting football and becoming a fulltime competitive video game player ."
4411,"i think he made the right call there , football players make tons of money"
4412,there's a lot of money to be made from all of the tv rightsespn even won an emmy for creating the superimposed first down line .
4413,"they did ? i guess espn changed the game with the creation of the yellow first down line , its on every game"
4414,"i wonder if canadians get the same line , or no one cares enough to bother there haha ."
4415,"i guess no one bothers lol , espn deserved the emmy , the first down line will continue to be part of the game for years to come ."
4416,hi . did you know espn won an emmy for that superimposed yellow line of theirs ?
4417,i did not know that ! i guess espn discovered something that people needed all along .
4418,"i don't see how it's needed , but i'm not a football fan . maybe they should have used it in that game of georgia tech , where they defeate their opponent 2220 ."
4419,it help understand just how close the team is to a first down . sometimes its not clear . i figure that gt did not need to do that to poor cumberland .
4420,"ah . okay . thanks for explaining it . i thought it may have been something to do with being owned by disney , and their imagineers were bored , lol . i would love to see the u of ia's pink , visitor's lockerroom ."
4421,i would love to see it too . and talk to the person that decided to do that . does it have any effect ? i wonder
4422,"i would think they would enjoy the ambiance , lol . it's weird that there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
4423,i guess there is a lot of standing and waiting and the officials conferring and stuff . great pay for all that waiting lol
4424,they sure do . what do you think of the use of tracking chips in the balls ?
4425,i think it is good to understand how the game works . i would like to improve player safety . i think the chips might help there .
4426,same with the ones in the shoulder pads ?
4427,"yes , they could help understand situations when players get hurt . maybe understand how to minimize risk of injury ."
4428,"i'm shocked a woman hasn't been on a team yet , the nfl doesn't have any rules prohibiting it ."
4429,"i would expect that some positions could be open to women , like kicker or punter . but there is pipeline of male talent ."
4430,"sounds kind of sexist , same with the saint's archaic rule against cheerleaders eating in the same restaurant as the players ."
4431,"yes , it is sexist and misogynistic . the cheerleaders are adults . they can be with the players in a public space ."
4432,"it's disgusting to think that if they are in the middle of their meal , they must leave when one comes in . it's for that reason alone , i don't buy any saints merch when i am in nola ."
4433,i dont know why that rule was started . there must have been a problem like romantic relationships or something .
4434,"one would think there would be more teams that hae that . being from cleveland , i'm grateful that baker mayfield didn't decide to become a pro gamer , for the tweets by the cpd alone ."
4435,i guess some people should become gamers because they dont have other sports to play . but he had a choice . that is an easy one to make in my mind .
4436,"supposedly , he's pretty good at halo 3 . that's a tough game , and pro gamers can rake in big bucks at tournaments ."
4437,"i guess they can , but how long is the career ? football can lead to many things . anyway , great chat !"
4438,"thanks , have a nice day ."
4439,quarterbacks are always the most known position of any football team in america . i guess that's because they have the ball on almost every play .
4440,whats your favorite football teams ?
4441,my favorites are the dallas cowboys and the kansas city chiefs . what are yours ?
4442,the dolphins and the eagles . who is your favorite quarterback of all time ?
4443,"that's a hard one . i like roger staubach , troy aikman , john elway , and currently patrick maholmes and baker mayfield . you ?"
4444,dan marino and cam newton . do you know who the only left handed quarterback currently is ?
4445,i think it is kellan moore . did you know that baker mayfield considered going into professional gaming ? he says he can beat anyone at halo 3 .
4446,idk if he can beat anyone cause my roomate is pretty good lol . do you know how many teams are currently in the whole league ?
4447,i am thinking 32 but i think they should add more and make the season longer . which conference do you like the best ?
4448,i like the nfc what about you ?
4449,i like the nfc too . will you be watching the super bowl ?
4450,definitely i'm going to be grilling some steaks and ribs a nice bbq to sit down and watch the game . who do you think will win this year ?
4451,"if dallas goes , then dallas . but if they don't , then kansas city . who do you think will win ?"
4452,i hope dallas wins it will be great for all the old school cowboys fans to see their team holding that trophy again . the chiefs have a good chance but i'm going for dallas .
4453,an eagles fan going for dallas ? that's a surprise !
4454,lol well i'm also a dolphins fans so you have to know i have family down south so i can definitely appreciate the team . do you know what the highest score in a game ever was ?
4455,makes sense . what was it ?
4456,says it was back in 1916 gerogia tech blew out cumberland 222 to zero
4457,definitely no defense from cumberland ! i like that the university of iowa paints the visiting team's locker room pink !
4458,lol its classic mental tactics to get into their heads . iowa's coach is a genius .
4459,true !
4460,"hi , how are you ?"
4461,"hey there , pretty well , how are you ?"
4462,"i am well , thanks . do you like football ?"
4463,i do how about you ?
4464,i do like it . my favorite team is the bears . how about you ?
4465,"did you know women can play in nfl as well , if they qualify ?"
4466,i did not . wow . there's only 11 minutes of play in an nfl game .
4467,i know yet we are glued tot he tv for hours to an end
4468,do you watch a lot of tv ? i wish i watched less .
4469,i do because i like to watch sports games a lot
4470,me too . that's what i watch all the time . do you know who tom brady is ?
4471,yes a very very famous quarterback that plays for the patriots
4472,his high school team was terrible and he still couldnt get into the game . seems like a giant misstep now .
4473,yeah go figure life sometimes . do you know alex smith ?
4474,"i do . he is a qb , right ?"
4475,yes . he was so good in school that when he entered university he was bumped to junior .
4476,"wow , i was so bad , they tried to keep me back a year . turns out i was just learning disabled ."
4477,yeah at least nowadays there are better way to figure those out . did you hear about the new oorleans cheerleaders rule ?
4478,"no , what is it ?"
4479,they cannot eat in the same restaurant as the players
4480,that's sexist . nice chatting with you !
4481,"hi , how are you ?"
4482,"hello , im great , so do you follow the nfl or college football ?"
4483,i follow both . do you follow either or both ?
4484,"i follow both , have you seen virginia tech play lately ?"
4485,i did a little last year but not recently . i went to illinois so i am a big 10 guy . do love the sec though . . . kind of have to .
4486,"i see , well it seems like the defense needs a complete make over , they have a terrible defense hopefully the team can get better this year ."
4487,wasnt' 2017 a really good year at vt ?
4488,"i think they had a good campaign in 2017 , i think there performance wasnt as good on 2018 , so do you have a favorite nfl team ?"
4489,i am a bears fan .
4490,"i see , too bad they didnt make it to the superbowl this year , when was the last time the bears made it ?"
4491,2006 . it was payton manning's first superbowl . he was with the colts . devin hester had that opening kickoff for a td and it was awesome ! i got so drunk that game .
4492,"that sounds like it was a great game indeed lol , its amazing how tech advances and now we can tell different data like the velocity , the rotation of the ball among others with the use of a simple chip ."
4493,i wish football had the tech tennis does . did you watch any of the australian open ?
4494,"i dont im not a big tennis fan , more a soccer or football fan myself"
4495,ok . . . the tennis tech is like the soccer tech when they try to figure out a goal . cant football use that tech ? it would be so much quicker
4496,i agree although players have also chips and i think that is really advanced .
4497,yeah but i feel like it's a waste if they are not using them to further the game . they use it for data and not game enhancement .
4498,"i can see your point , you know there is a high school football stadium that had a cost of 60 million dollars , what a waste of money ! !"
4499,i bet it's in texas ! there's like 10 of them there . big oil money plus football crazy is 60m stadiums !
4500,"hopefully it didnt come out of drug money , we waste enormous amount of money on stadium we have 14 of the biggest stadiums on the world on a list of 25"
4501,jerry's world should count twice !
4502,"hi , how are you ?"
4503,i'm doing well . i'm surprised kirk cousins was worth such a huge contract to other teams .
4504,i guess it depends on the fit of the qb with the team and the coach .
4505,did you know the circular huddle was originally for a quarterback that was deaf so he could hear ?
4506,i thought it was to shield the qb's hand signals from the other team .
4507,yeah . did you know that kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl ?
4508,really ? is there something about being a lefty that makes it difficult on offense ?
4509,"i'm not sure , it might be hard for them to succeed since so many players are used to right handers ."
4510,i wonder about blocking assignments and receivers and such . there's no rule against women playing in the nfl . i wonder if we'll ever see a female on the field .
4511,"maybe , it depends . the average earnings of an engineer is higher than an nfl player on average ."
4512,probably safer for women to become engineers . plus we need more engineers . they could improve the chips in the players shoulder pads .
4513,"crazy , i read that they follow them that closely , i don't know if it is worth it ."
4514,"it might help understand strategy , or cause and nature of injury ."
4515,this is true . but then again the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of game play .
4516,not much action . a lot of time for commercials . a lot of standing around .
4517,that and a lot of fiddling with the play clock and running out the clock .
4518,"that's true . the game has changed a lot . for example , in the 1960s , pro bowlers made more than football players ."
4519,"that's insane , i be engineers made more than the average bowler back in the day too . sounds like being an engineer is the way to go ."
4520,"if you got the brain and the interest ! lots of people find it tough and boring . well , i enjoyed chatting !"
4521,nice chatting with you too !
4522,bye !
4523,hi how are you ? do you like football ?
4524,"hi ! yes , i learned to like it with my husband and father in law . they are hardcore fans . how about you ? i like to bears , im from illinois but my husbands family like the chiefs"
4525,i am not really a fan . i try to watch the playoffs and the super bowl . i like to root for the underdog .
4526,"i agree , me too ! i only watch it when its on . i did watch the super bowl i know some people love brady some hate him but there is no doubt he is amazing !"
4527,"i dont love or hate him particularly , but the patriots seem to win a lot . i would like to see another team have a chance ."
4528,"right ! this is the 6th super bowl they've won i think and i agree . there are a lot of great players who have done great things for instance brad johnson , he threw a touchdown pass to himself ! lol he made it into history hes the only one to do that !"
4529,how on earth did he do that ? i want to see the footage of that .
4530,"haha , i know ! i didnt know that was possible . . . maybe rules changed after that . there is also a left handed quarterback in the nfl , kellen moore , he is the only one . im sure he has thrown some people off at first . there are a lot of interesting facts surrounding football , i must admit ."
4531,i guess the defense has to adjust to a new rhythm a different blind side .
4532,yes ! i know brady takes all the shine but there are alot of great players and coaches . like matt patricia . . . he is a rocket scientist besides a coach ! how cool !
4533,he must have a terrific mind to be able to do both . i envy him .
4534,me too ! i cant even leave my house . . . i have 2 year old twins ! can you imagine how loaded he must be . i wonder if he is one of the highest paid coach of the service teams . apparently there are only 3 .
4535,"ok . i wonder about that too . the services have football teams , but are they competitive ?"
4536,"im not sure , but it seems to be a lot of money as i expect especially since they humongous flags at football stadiums cost about 50 grand and weigh 1 , 100 pounds ."
4537,i wonder what kind of cloth they are made out of . that is really heavy . you could get trapped under that .
4538,"for sure , and a lot of money ! i would hate to be under that if it fell , its a very expensive and lucrative sport ."
4539,i think that the focus of college has shifted too much to sports . the money is driving the schools away from their focus .
4540,"i agree , there is a high school stadium in texas that cost over 60 mill to build !"
4541,"it is like a megachurch dedicated to sport . anyway , great chat !"
4542,"yes , pretty much . it seats about 18 , 000 peeps . its better than a concert ! and its only a high school . . . fun chatting with you too !"
4543,have a good day !
4544,"you too ! sending you hugs and love to you lovely stranger ! hope you have an amazing day : ,"
4545,how are you doing ? do you like watching the nfl ? surprisingly there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay .
4546,"i'm great great , how are you ? yes i love watching football and that blows my mind to think since we sit and watch a game for hours !"
4547,yes half the time i feel like i'm watching commercials . i'm still waiting for the first woman to play in the nfl because there is no written rule against it .
4548,"that would be a great day for society ! i wonder what position she would try out for , kicker ?"
4549,"yeah kicker if she was smaller but maybe wide receiver if she was a bigger . one thing is for certain , i wouldn't want to be a cheerleader for the new orleans saints because they can't eat at the same restaurant as the players ."
4550,imagine getting a steak and then having to leave because somebody came in . that is crazy to me ! i do like the nfl technology though !
4551,"yeah you bring up a good point they have a lot of technology at their disposal . they even have chips inside of the footballs to track velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location ."
4552,players can have their every move tracked on the field as well ! espn even won an emmy for that yellow line we see on the field haha .
4553,oh wow ! i wonder if they track the quarterbacks every movement ? i also wonder if a lefthanded has different movements then a right had a quarterback . kellan moore would know .
4554,"isn't he the only left handed quarterback in the league right now ? the only others ones i can think of are brunell , steve young , and michael vick !"
4555,yeah are used to like watching michael vick . but i think he is the only current one now . quarterbacks are so important . baker mayfield almost quit football to become a competitive video game player .
4556,"i'm sure he's happy he changed his mind . if he keeps it up , he'll be making much much more than he would have playing video games !"
4557,yes good point . although not as much as an engineer !
4558,"i guess if they take all the players that only play one or two years into that average , i do believe engineers in fact make more in their lifetime !"
4559,"yes that is very surprising , it must be because the nfl players career is so short . top bowlers in the 1960s used to make more than top football players as well ."
4560,"i think i would have loved being a bowler back then , but yet again , how much is more for payment back then ?"
4561,yeah i'm not sure that's a good question ! there is only one running back i have ever heard of that has never fumbled the football and that is been benjarvus greenellis who played for the patriots .
4562,"that is a crazy stat because he played in the league for years ! these days , it's common for a running back to fumble like every other game ! i wonder how many fumbles were in the 2220 game back in 1916 lol ."
4563,wow what a beating that was . georgia tech must've been really good or cumberland must've been really bad . well it was nice chatting with you today !
4564,i think i would have just walked off the field at that point . it was nice chatting with you as well !
4565,"have a good saturday , see ya !"
4566,"hi , how are you ?"
4567,good and you ?
4568,i'm fine ! shall we chat about football ?
4569,sure . do you know much about football ? i confess i only have a basic knowledge of the sport .
4570,"i only know a little myself . for example , the huddle is such a fundamental part of the game that i didn't even think about its origins . paul d . hubbard created the huddle in today's football . reason : he's deaf quarterback . he didn't want the other team to read his hand signals ."
4571,i wonder if any of the hand signals have an signifigance in asl since there are deaf and hard of hearing players on the teams .
4572,"that's a good point . in the 60s bowlers made twice as much as football stars . still , i wonder how much bowlers made overall . was it that much money ?"
4573,i think back then the players in the nfl weren't getting the exorbident sums they are now . given all the injuries they sustain though i think the pay is mostly justified .
4574,"on a perminute basis , they make a great wage . there is only 11 minutes of action on average ."
4575,that has to be without the huddles and hikes and all that because there is a clock that ticks down . i think it must be 11 minutes of actual moving .
4576,"did you know that there is only one lefthanded quarterback in the nfl ? kellan moore . i expected more , considering how many lefty pitchers there are in the mlb ."
4577,i didn't know that . i wonder if it is because of the way the ball is thrown and caught . it seems like it would be harder to do lefthanded than with say a baseball .
4578,i wonder if the plays have to be reworked for a lefty . the receiver routes and such
4579,i would imagine so . it is hard to catch things from a lefty . everything is always just a bit off .
4580,"the nfl has no rules against women playing . i think that women could play at certain positions , like kicker . women would probably draw a lot of interest , perhaps increase the tv audience ."
4581,if a woman is kicker does she still have to meet the same requirements as the other players ?
4582,"i suppose there is a lot of competition for kicker , so it would be tough . plus there is no feeder system like for men . women soccer players might qualify ."
4583,i would think that when it comes to kickers there would be more crossover between football and soccer . i think there woudl be alot less missed field goals .
4584,"if there were a compelling case for a women , i think a team would hire her . well , it's been great chatting with you ! have a good day ! enjoy football !"
4585,yes it has been very educational . i learned quite a bit about it .
4586,thanks !
4587,do you like to watch football ?
4588,"i love watching football , how about you ?"
4589,"it's not my favorite sport to watch , honestly . i prefer to watch soccer , tennis , skiing , ice skating . but that's just me . what is your favorite football team ?"
4590,"i like the vikings and the university of iowa for college , you ?"
4591,"honestly , i'm not sure . maybe the patriots because i'm from new england ? but honestly , they have won a lot and i like underdog teams ."
4592,i like underdog teams too . did you ever hear about iowa and their pink locker room for their opponents ?
4593,i have . i am not sure how i feel about that . i think its stupid and sexist . they should instead paint it some bright neon distracting color .
4594,"i think they use pink for psychology purposes , not sexism . it is a natural calming color and it is used to relax the other team"
4595,really ? hm . did you know the nfl has no written rule against female players ?
4596,"i did not know that , i wonder why there hasn't been a women playing before , not even a kicker"
4597,"i think it is because they still have to meet the league's eligability requirements . speaking of sexism tho , new orleans saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player . if they are eating in a restaurant and an nfl player enters , they are required to leave . crazy !"
4598,"i heard that , that is sexism 101 ! i wonder why no one has taken them to court over that . now is the time to end that"
4599,"yes . imagine you are in the middle of eating your meal , and you have to leave because an nfl football player walked in ?"
4600,"right , that is not cool at all . let them enjoy their meals !"
4601,"seriously . like i can imagine a rule against socializing with football players of the opposite team , but to have to leave the restaurant is absurd ."
4602,that is true things need to change . did you hear about tracking chips in shoulder pads for players now ?
4603,i have heard about that . makes sense . did they not have them before ' deflategate ' . lol
4604,maybe they were created because of that lol ! i bet they were created by engineers who make more money in their lifetime than most nfl players
4605,"that is surprising , but then i guess nfl players have a short career time while engineers have a long career ."
4606,"for sure , i should have dreamed to be an engineer as a kid ! it was so nice chatting with you !"
4607,"but then , good for the engineers , because being one requires a lot of skill and knowledge . and it's very important for keeping everyone in society safe ."
4608,"for sure , have a great weekend and enjoy your day !"
4609,do you watch the nfl ?
4610,yes i do . do you like brady ?
4611,yes i do did you know he was a backup qb in high school ?
4612,yeah and he was never started when they were not doing well
4613,yeah . do you know who alex smith is ?
4614,yes he is the qb that finished college in two years
4615,yeah he took lots of ap tests in high school
4616,yeah smart kids really planned ahead of time
4617,yeah . do you know who invented the circular huddle ?
4618,yes it was paul hubbard who was deaf and did not want the other team to understand him
4619,yeah cool trick . baker mayfield wanted to quit football to become a gamer
4620,wow better that he did not . do you you u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
4621,yes and i wonder if it is supposed to have some effect on them
4622,i wonder too . in the 60s bowlers made more than football players
4623,yea i guess it was not as popular of a sport back then
4624,true . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
4625,yes that was 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
4626,yeah that was back in 1916 and that was quite something
4627,yeah . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
4628,yes for the superimposed yellow line
4629,yeah it has made game watching much easier for us
4630,i enjoy the nfl . how about yourself ?
4631,"i do to , but don't really follow the nfl . . . but wish i could !"
4632,sometimes it's difficult with so many games . did you know that there are no written rules against female players ?
4633,"really ? that's cool . i wonder if there will ever be any female players in the nfl , like maybe a quarterback ! haha"
4634,"they still have to meet requirements and with the size of those men i kind of doubt it . while i am glad they do not have rules against female players , i am angered by the sexist way in which the saints treat their players ."
4635,i agree ! being forbidden to eat in the same place as they do is ridiculous . they even have to leave if they were there 1st ! football can have some crazy rules even outside of the game .
4636,you got it but i meant to say players not cheerleaders even though they are team players in their own way . yes i do not understand why they would have to stop eating and leave . that's ridiculous and i can't think of a single good reason for it . it seems humiliating .
4637,"oh , gotcha . yes it is definitely insane if you ask me . very humiliating ! i do like how the university of iowa painter the locker room pink for visitors haha , crazy !"
4638,that seems like some kind of psychological warfare . did you know that in the nfl they use tracking chips on players and footballs to track their every move ? i wonder why they don't use that to make calls instead of just relying on reviews ?
4639,"wow , didn't know that , but i agree ! it would make sense ! there was a patriot's player who never fumbled the football in his nfl career . . . if they were tracking maybe that would change ! i bet he was an excellent player though ."
4640,that was benjarvus greenellis . i believe he was a rb .
4641,"exactly ! so do you have a favorite team or player in the nfl ? i like the quartebacks , they are such an important part of the game ."
4642,i like the bears . their new qb needs some work . how about yourself ?
4643,"i gotta stay with my home team qb , josh rosen . . . i know , they are not the best but hey , i love them ."
4644,they've certainly had their moments over the last few years . are you familiar with alex smith ?
4645,they have had there moments ! is he the guy that got his bachelor's degree in 2 years ? and became the 1st overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft ?
4646,yes he did . he entered college as a junior and was working on his master's when drafted . he's a very smart man .
4647,"wow , i do remember that . very smart to get that education . just like baker mayfield . . . . he is an excellent video game player . he even considered quitting football to play video games !"
4648,it would certainly be easier on his body . he could always do it later . are you familiar with kellan moore ?
4649,right ! those players get beat up some games . isn't kellan a qb ?
4650,yes he is and the only left handed one in the league .
4651,do you like football ? i read that tom brady in highschool jv team was never allowed to play and now he is the super bowl champion
4652,i love football . glad the playoffs are here but sad the season is drawing to a close too
4653,i read that the circular huddle was created by paul d . hubbard who was deaf and he wanted to make sure his teammates could his hand signals
4654,that is true . who do you think will be representing the afc and nfc in the super bowl this year .
4655,i thinkk maybe the saint and chiefs
4656,are you a fan of either team ?
4657,yes i like the saints . what about you ? did you know that the nfl has no writtn rule against female pllayers
4658,i hope to see one at least as a kicker in the nfl soon . i like the saints too
4659,an article i read says that the nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
4660,"yeah , they are too busy showing us ads to generate revenue ."
4661,speaking of saints . the cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player
4662,"thats a bit hypocritical of the team and the nfl given their stance against violence against women , don't you think ?"
4663,"yes , i find it quite odd . it also says that even if they are already eating at a restaurant and one of the football players come in the cheerleaders are required to leave"
4664,"i would like to see the nfl season extended by giving another bye week , especially if games are being played overseas"
4665,that would make sense . i saw that an engineers lifetime earnings are higher than an average nfl player
4666,i find that hard to believe given the enormity of some of the nfl contracts these days
4667,that is actually what i was thinking . i saw that espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line that represents the first down line for american football games
4668,"yeah , maybe they will get another one for the projected field goal line they have nowadays for next years awards"
4669,i saw that the highest score ever in a football game was when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 they must have been a really bad team
4670,i thought the colts were going to score that many during the houston game yesterday . . . lol
4671,lol . . i feel bad for that team back in 1916 . it must have been a depressing game to play
4672,time to watch the football games !
4673,good evening . do you like football ?
4674,i do like football . do you have a favorite quarterback ?
4675,all time joe montana . did you know the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink
4676,i didn't . that's an interesting tactic . i think it's pretty interesting that ben roethlisberger is the winningest quarterback in the cleveland browns stadium .
4677,that is an interesting fact . i also read that the cheerleaders from the saints can not eat in the same restaurant the players are in
4678,i've actually heard about such restrictions . seems a little antiquated to me . did you know that russell wilson is still under a mlb contract even though he hasn't played in a regular season game since 2011 . he got traded to the yankees this year .
4679,wow . i wonder how that was possible ? i don't know much about baseball
4680,seems an odd thing to do . his contract must not be worth very much and maybe they hope he'll retire from football and start playing baseball again . wilson is also only one of 2 africanamerican quarterbacks to have won a super bowl .
4681,did you know that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay
4682,that is amazing . i guess it makes sense . they apparently have chips in the players shoulder pads and the footballs to record movements and other statistics .
4683,i did read about that . former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
4684,i actually had no idea . brad johnson is the only quarterback in nfl history to throw a touchdown pass to himself . i'd like to see some video of that !
4685,"that would be an amazing video . the circular huddle used in todays american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not read his hand signals ."
4686,clever . kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl . i guess football doesn't attract left handers like baseball does .
4687,i did not know that . did you know there is no written rules against female players
4688,"if i had to guess we'd probably see a female kicker first . speaking of firsts , the first nfl game was played in 1932 inside chicago stadium ."
4689,did you know tom brady was a backup quarter back who was never played by his team and they never won a game
4690,"well , i bet they wish that they had played him now . matt patricia is the only rocket scientist coaching in the nfl ."
4691,here's something crazy the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220
4692,poor cumberland . college football teams have some of the largest stadiums in the world . in fact 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums are college football teams .
4693,you would think it would be the professional stadiums .
4694,"you would , but they're note . high school football stadiums are also somewhat out of control . there is a high school football stadium in texas that seats 18 , 000 ."
4695,wow that's amazing . well texas is a big state .
4696,it is and if there is anywhere that they love football it is certainly texas . high school football is a really big deal in certain areas . snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team .
4697,i read that about snoop dog . have a great night .
4698,"hi , how are you ?"
4699,"hello everything good , do you like football ? i didnt know there was no rule against a female player ."
4700,i do like football . i was shocked about that too . and that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay
4701,"yeah that seems unreal as a game tends to last really long , that might explain why an engineer would eventually earn more than a player ."
4702,i thought it was because the average career is 2 yeras vs an engineers beings 30 years . do you have a favorite team ?
4703,"yeah that could be it , i do have a favorite team i love the patriots i became a fan with the rb benjarvus greenellis , crazy how he never fumbled , what about you ?"
4704,"the saints . new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave ."
4705,"thats kind of demeaning , that shouldnt be a rule . what is your favorite football position ?"
4706,i like the tight end . what about you ?
4707,"i like qb , i just like how he seems to be the leader of the team , i like tom brady ."
4708,i may like the te but i do love baker mayfield . i love his swagger . . .
4709,"he is a great player , did you know he considered quitting football once to persue a gaming carreer ?"
4710,really ? i did not . i know he left texas tech and went on to oklahoma as a walk on .
4711,"yeah , it seems like he is a really skilled gamer , he beat anyone in halo 3 no one could beat him at his college"
4712,wow . that's crazy . do you play video games like that ?
4713,"yes i do like to play halo 3 and other video games , what about you ?"
4714,i used to play modern warfare all the time and then i got married and my priorities shifted . really haven't played since then .
4715,"yeah that is a good game , i like it as well . i also like the madden game"
4716,"i used to love madden . i stopped playing for like 15 years and when i returned , i got mollywhopped . it was sad . . ."
4717,"i can imagine lol , if you stop practicing then your skills can be seriously hurt . i was pretty good as well i think even a 5 year old can beat me now ."
4718,"nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
4719,hi . do you like football at all ?
4720,"hello there , i do like football , i usually follow pretty closely during the season . how about you ?"
4721,me too . have you watched patrick mahomes of the kansas city chiefs ?
4722,"i have , i was hoping that he would have gone to the super bowl this season . how about you ?"
4723,i'm a new england patriots fan so i'm glad that he didn't but he will go to the super bowl eventually with the numbers that he put in this season .
4724,"yeah you sure are glad then , your team has been dominating the last decade or so i would say . speaking of qb's , do you know who the only left handed one in the league is ?"
4725,i believe its keelan moore but i'm not sure .
4726,"good call ! yeah it's him , i am surprised there aren't more . did you know baker mayfield is an excellent video game player ?"
4727,yes . i heard somewhere that he is a very good halo 3 player and that he thought of quitting football to pursue full time competitive gaming .
4728,"yeah that was it , halo 3 , have you ever played any of the halo games , i used to play the first halo back when i was at school ."
4729,i loved halo 3 and i use to play it all the time a few years ago .
4730,"i don't think i have ever played that one , 1 and 2 i did . speaking of qb's again , do you know which one invented the modern huddle ?"
4731,i believe if i'm not mistaken it was paul d . hubbard .
4732,"good call again ! yeah and he was a deaf quarterback as well , so that is even cooler !"
4733,wow i didn't know that he was deaf . that is amazing ! ! !
4734,do you know what the highest score of any football game ever was ?
4735,i think it was something like 2220 and it happen long time ago .
4736,"yeah it was , way back in 1916 , poor cumberland lost to georgia tech , sounds like it was never even a game ."
4737,yeah ! ! ! it appears that game was over very quick .
4738,"yeah sure does , wonder how many cumberland fans were left when the final whistle blew ."
4739,yeah ! ! ! i bet not that many that's for sure .
4740,and only the die hard cumberland ones too lol .
4741,yeah ! ! it was a very embarrassing performance by them that day .
4742,"yeah and that's an understatement . anyways , its been fun talking , i hope you enjoy the rest of your night ."
4743,"hello there , do you follow the nfl at all ?"
4744,i love the nfl and i do follow it every week when in season .
4745,"yeah i follow as well , mostly my team , but more so when the playoffs come around ."
4746,who is your team in the nfl ?
4747,"i follow the packers , was a big brett favre fan , how about you ? do you have a team that you follow ?"
4748,i'm a big new england patriots fan . we just won the superbowl against a not so tough la rams team .
4749,"nice ! i was hoping for a bit more scoring during the game , but it got very exciting near the end ."
4750,yes it did with the rams running out of gas . do you know by any chance how many minutes does the average nfl game has ?
4751,i think i read somewhere it was like 11 minutes or something on average of actual game play .
4752,you're correct . do you know if female players can play in the nfl ?
4753,"that is right ! there is no rule about female players , i think it would be so cool if one did make a roster and played ."
4754,that would be very nice . did you know that baker mayfield considered quitting football at one point ?
4755,"i think i heard that he was really good at video games so that might be why he thought about quitting , am i right ?"
4756,yes that is correct . he is a very good halo 3 player .
4757,"yeah i think you're right , did you ever play any of those halo games ?"
4758,i did and i think i was pretty good .
4759,"speaking of football , did you hear that espn once won an emmy for football ?"
4760,no . i didn't know . do you happen to know for what they won emmy ?
4761,"yeah it was way back when they started putting that yellow line in to show where the first down yard line was , it did help a lot i will say ."
4762,wow that is very nice . i do agree with you . do you happen to know who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
4763,"right now , i think it's kellan moore , but i could be wrong ."
4764,you're correct . its is kellan moore . well it was very nice chatting with you today . i hope you have a nice night ! ! !
4765,"nice ! yeah same to you , i hope you have a good night ."
4766,"hello , are you a fan of american football ?"
4767,"yes , i am huge american football fan . are you ?"
4768,"i am somewhat , i mainly follow interesting facts about it . i'm in new england , i never knew how bad tom brady's high school team was !"
4769,yes ! tom brady has come a long way from junipero serra high school football . i'm curious what alex smith studied when he was at university .
4770,"that's true , i heard he was so smart he got a bachelor's degree in two years all before declaring for the draft ! guess it really does pay to take ap classes huh ."
4771,"smith has plenty of options is the whole football thing doesn't work for him . just like baker mayfield , who could become a fulltime competitive gamer"
4772,"that's interesting though , i wonder if that would have been a better option . a lot of quarterbacks are unique , i heard kellan moore is the nfl's only left handed quarterback ."
4773,it would be really unique if a woman was playing football . there are no rules against women playing as long they meet the eligibility requirements
4774,"shocking , especially considering i would say the league hasn't successfully represented itself as not sexist . i know in new orleans , saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if football players come in to eat after them ."
4775,that's incredibly disappointing . even the university of iowa paints the visiting teams' locker room pink .
4776,"i bet that doesn't really faze people at this point , at least it shouldn't . at least things are improving more than they are getting worse , i believe they use tracking chips in shoulder pads to better track players and learn ."
4777,i like your positivity ! it's important to innovate . espn even won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line .
4778,i bet that wouldn't have happened back when they didn't care about football as much . i think in the 60's bowlers got paid more somehow .
4779,"good point . football is so risky . over their lifetime , an engineer would make more than the average nfl or mlb player . it's a much safer route !"
4780,"that's certainly a shame , and surprising . i feel they should get incentives for exceptional play . benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the football his entire career , that should certainly be worth some money ."
4781,that is talented . the bucs should look at signing him . especially if they fire everyone after their 4810 loss to the bears
4782,"oh yeah that's an embarrassing loss for sure . still it can get worse , i heard the worst loss ever was 2220 , i can't imagine showing up after losing by that much ."
4783,"well ryan fitzpatrick is still employed by the bucs , even though he was benched for jameis winston is that terrible loss ."
4784,"i heard james winston has done some terrible things though , like he was investigated after groping an uber driver . i don't feel comfortable with him being employed either !"
4785,"if true , that sort of behavior cannot be tolerated . even if he was drafted by no . 1 by tampa bay in 2015 ."
4786,"definitely , we'd hope players don't get preferential treatment just based on how valuable they are to the game . anyway , it was nice talking to you , have a nice day !"
4787,are you a fan of the nfl ?
4788,i am ! my favorite team is the dallas cowboys . what about you ?
4789,"i am a vikings fan , but not religiously . good thing you aren't a saints fan , did you hear how they treat their cheerleaders ?"
4790,i actually did ! i couldn't be one and agree to leave a restaurant simply because an nfl player decided to eat there too . i think that's ridiculous !
4791,"right , very sexist , i hope other teams don't do it . i wonder what the reason is"
4792,"i'm guessing , but probably to prevent dating the nfl players and socializing with them ."
4793,right and distracting them before big games . did you know the nfl only has like 11 minutes of actual gameplay
4794,that's crazy since a game typically takes 2 hours or so to actually complete . football actually can refer to a number of different sports depending on what country or region you use the word ' football ' .
4795,even 3 hours sometimes lol . i know football is soccer everywhere else besides the us lol
4796,"actually , it can refer to rugby , australian rules football , and gaelic football as well as soccer . so many variations !"
4797,"wow , that is so many variations ! do you have a favorite quarterback ?"
4798,"my favorite qb used to be troy aikman until i met him and learned how much of an arrogant , rude , inconsiderate person he is . my husband loves tom brady . you ?"
4799,"yikes scary , i never knew that about troy aikman ! that stinks ! tom brady is so good !"
4800,"yeah , but i still love emmitt smith . he was humble and nice . tom brady is good ! he has 6 super bowl rings to prove it !"
4801,"for sure , did you know in high school though , tom bradys jv team never won a game and the coach refused to put him in !"
4802,haha ! well he is probably regretting that decision !
4803,i bet lol . do you follow college football ?
4804,"not very much . my husband does though , so we watch uga play a lot and he likes to watch sony michel with the patriots ."
4805,"nice , good team ! i am an iowa hawkeye fan , did you hear about their locker room ?"
4806,oh yes ! ! ! i heard the visitor's locker room in painted pink ! ! ! haha i think that's awesome !
4807,"right , it is psychology 101 basically ! great chatting with you ! enjoy your day !"
4808,"hi , how are y'all tonight ?"
4809,i'm still depressed that the patriots won the nfl super bowl .
4810,why ? did you lose money on a wager or something ?
4811,i hate the patriots because they win every year . i like the redskins but they can't keep a quarterback with two working legs .
4812,legs are overrated . they got that controversial mascots . that will get them noticed ! perhaps they could paint the visitor's locker room pink ?
4813,"yes the university of iowa did that . it was different ! back in the 1960s the top bowlers made twice as much as football stars , crazy !"
4814,"i think the bowlers probably bribed them tv people ! football is a better sport , objectively and biblically !"
4815,certainly a lot of tech has come about from football espn won an emmy for the yellow superimposed line
4816,"for the u of iowa , i think they do a pink line for visitors ."
4817,laugh ! the nfl even uses tracking chips in the players shoulder pads as well as inside the football .
4818,maybe it's to make sure women aren't posing as men .
4819,actually women are allowed to play nfl football
4820,no ! i can't believe there isn't anything in the rules ! check again !
4821,you must be from new orleans where the cheerleaders are not even allowed to eat in the same restaurant as a nfl player
4822,perhaps it's to prevent fraternization . a lot of players can be distracted by cheerleaders .
4823,that is why the engineers earn more money than an average nfl player not distracted by any girls !
4824,"engineering , like football , is a profession mostly taken up by men , so i'm sure some would be distracted by women in their career ."
4825,trust me the girls don't want to date engineers you must be one !
4826,"if i am an engineer , then women won't date me . if women won't date me , then i'm an engineer ? where are my earnings then ? well , i enjoyed chatting !"
4827,well 11 minutes of gameplay in the standard nfl game is about how long we chatted .
4828,"i did not earn as much , unfortunately . may the officials be on your side , sir ."
4829,yes perhaps take up bowling and make some more cash . good night !
4830,"the nfl is a professional american football league consisting of 32 teams , all the player are eager to lift the trophy ."
4831,some just never seem to get close . lol
4832,"the nfl has no written rule against female players , women would able to met the leagues eligibility requirement . the first evidence of women playing football is organized in 1926 ."
4833,"yeah , there is gaelic football which some women play too ."
4834,"the team won the most championship is green bay packers , with 13 wins the highest afterwards , super bowl with 9 wins ."
4835,i am surprised it isnt the patriots . they have won 6 alone with tom brady as the qb .
4836,yeah . pittsburgh steelers also won 6 wins . all the team and coach working hard to lift the trophy .
4837,"did you hear about that one game in 1916 , 2220 . crazy score . georgia tech was definitely working hard there ."
4838,i feel sad for cumberland . it was the greatest in the history forever . people never forget this defeat .
4839,"i dont even understand how a score can get that high , there are usually only 11 minutes of active game play per game ."
4840,yeah . i also feel the same . nfl uses tracking chips in the player shoulder pads to record their movement in the field . this shows how aggressive to lift the trophy .
4841,i think they also use the data to prevent player injury and to improve the pads themselves . which is cool
4842,they tracking the ball speed and how players react in the pressure situation .
4843,"i bet it changes things for kellan moore , hes the only southpaw in the nfl"
4844,"yeah . sports commonly called football in certain places include association football . it is also a team sports , many countries like this game ."
4845,which is what the us likes to call soccer . it is also a great game .
4846,"in modern american football , the quarterback is considered as the leader of the offensive team . quarterback can also spike ."
4847,there was once a deaf quarterback that actually created the modern day circular huddle .
4848,it is very interesting .
4849,"yeah , he didnt want the opposing team stealing his hand signals ."
4850,such tactics are also the part of the game . he want to win the game for his team .
4851,"alex smith did as well , he stuck around after earning his degree and started work on a masters ."
4852,the cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if the player comes cheerleaders are asked to take leave the restaurant .
4853,i think that is horrible . that is no way to treat people .
4854,they are focusing on their game . to avoid distraction .
4855,what does eating at a restaurant have to do with the game ?
4856,the nfl regular season starts from early september to late december . each team playing 16 games with each other .
4857,"that seems like a long time . its been nice chatting , but i've got to get going . have a nice day"
4858,"hi , how are you ?"
4859,"good , do you follow football ? the ravens did pretty good against the raiders offense , att judon had 3 sacks"
4860,"i don't know the football too good . the sacks are a good thing , yes ?"
4861,"yea , matt judon also had three tackles against the raiders too , he had an awesome game"
4862,the man has the raiders' number .
4863,"yea , baltimore usually has great defenses , they are average allowing 1 . 6 points per drive"
4864,that is so stingy ! they are tough to play . i guess they are the specter of death for most offences .
4865,well cumberland could have used a miracle back in 1916 when they lost to georgia tech 2220
4866,"i think that the cumberland guys took a dive . they weren't supposed to lose that bad , but they wanted to win a bet . shameful ."
4867,"maybe . there's a running back who has never fumbled a football in his career , benjarvusgreen ellis , he played for new england"
4868,mr . ellis is a legend . he must have a secret technique . or huge hands . or special gloves .
4869,i wonder if the tracking chips embedded in players' equipment could reveal the secrets
4870,the tracking chips would be a good way to unlock the secrets of all the concussions the players suffer . i would like to know what they do with the data .
4871,it's crazy that the engineers who design them make more in a lifetime on average than the average nfl player
4872,the engineers don't suffer injuries or concussions either . i figure it's a good gig .
4873,"yea , it's pretty crazy that top bowlers made more than football stars back in the 1960s"
4874,i wonder how much that actually was . did they make money from endorsement for mayonnaise and pizza ? or beer ?
4875,"who knows , i wonder if they have many left hand bowlers , the nfl only has one left handed qb , kellan moore"
4876,"i bet they do have lefthanded bowlers . qbs ? probably there's an issue with the plays or something . anyway , great chat !"
4877,"you too , i'm gonna catch some football on espn and their emmy winning yellow line"
4878,that is a good idea . have a good night !
4879,you too
4880,"i don't watch football much , but i have to admit that i do pay some attention to the regular nfl season and playoffs"
4881,do you live in a city with one of the 32 nfl teams ?
4882,"i do , actually , and that's the team i usually pay attention to . especially since if there's a home game on a day that i work , it can affect the traffic on my commute home . i wouldn't ever try out for the nfl , though there's no written rule against females"
4883,there are 16 team in the afc and 16 in the nfc . which one is in your city ?
4884,"afc . they did better this year than usual , though the singleelimination in the playoffs stopped them from going to the super bowl"
4885,"i see , i am in an nfc city . we did so poorly that we get the number one draft pick this year . since the browns established themselves in cleveland , the winningest qb has been a pittsburgh steeler , not a brown's qb"
4886,"the qb definitely has a lot to do with how well a team does . though since an nfl game only has about 11 of live gameplay , i wonder how much of it is used by the qb"
4887,the qb touches the ball on every play some i would guess at least one third of the gameplay . he holds it longer on a pass than on a handoff . your team bowed out because the playoffs are indeed single elimination . it is not like baseball .
4888,"definitely not , though best out of seven is a lot to watch and causes even more traffic than the playoffs do . whether it's the nfl or mlb , the average engineer is still likely to make more money in a lifetime than the average player . though qb's are typically above average"
4889,my next door neighbor was a running back and made 7 million in one season . i started as an engineer and made about 4 . 5 million in my career . one of us is not average ! . there is one high school stadium in texas that cost 60 million to build .
4890,he must have been a good player . i've heard those texans really love their football . i wonder how many in the nfl draft actually came from a high school in texas compared to other states
4891,"i'll bet it is high . high school football on a friday night is huge in texas . that stadium seats 18 , 000"
4892,"players on that team are probably used to playing under a lot of pressure . i wonder how big the stadium was when georgia tech beat cumberland 2200 back in 1916 ? then again , that game would have gotten boring seeing all those touchdowns from the same team !"
4893,it would be like watching a horror movie . i was on a high school jv team that lost to the varsity of a smaller school by 740 . they ran the clock in the second half even on incomplete passes . there needs to be a mercy rule .
4894,"maybe that's why the score was so high . there was a high school jv team that not only lost , but failed to score a touchdown the whole season . the backup qb , whom they never put in , was tom brady . big mistake there"
4895,that is a story for the ages . the 3 highest paid employees in the department of defense are the football coaches at the service academies .
4896,"of course they are . football is where the money is now . though some , like baker mayfield , almost quit football to do competitive gaming . i guess he stuck to it as the qb of the university of oklahoma"
4897,i went to oklahoma . he did stay and won the heisman trophy . he could beat anyone on the team in halo .
4898,i guess we'll never know how he would have done in the world of competitive gaming . paul d . hubbard was a deaf quarterback and created the circular huddle so he could signal to his teammates without the other team seeing
4899,necessity does cause inventions . the first nfl game was on an 80 yard long dirt field .
4900,that sounds like the kind of fields i've played flag football in !
4901,"hello , do you enjoy football ?"
4902,"yes , i like it especially out at the live games where you can really get the feel from it . i heard about nathan peterman who completed 5 out of 18 passes for 24 yards and two interceptions a 0 . 0 passer rating while getting sacked three times before getting benched . gee ."
4903,"wow , i do too ! i love going to the games ! ! that is quiet a performance ! !"
4904,"well , a lot of other women know a lot more than me about it . but , i do know that the sport commonly called football in certain places includes association football which is known as soccer in most countries . in america , we love what is called gridiron football ."
4905,"yes , i know . association football is soccer . it can get confusing if your not familiar with it ! !"
4906,"that's the truth . there are a number of references to traditional , ancient , or prehistoric ball games played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world . we love our games !"
4907,"true , did you know the buffalo bills are equal to the new england patriots in superbowl loses ! !"
4908,i remember hearing that . something else i recently learned about football is that the league consists of 32 teams which are divided equally between the nfc and the afc . i didn't catch on to that before .
4909,i had heard that too ! very interesting . . . how talented is benjarvus greenellis in his nfl career to have never fumbled the football ?
4910,"yes , he must have very sticky hands . lol . another interesting football fact is that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
4911,after going to so many games i believe it ! ! lots of time to run to bathroom or get a treat ! ! lol
4912,"i was surprised , it just seems to take so long for the game to be over . new technology might help though . nfl now uses tracking chips embedded in the players' shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field ."
4913,"yes , that's a great thing to have ! have you heard the author of the games of thrones calls the new england patrots the lannisters of the nfl ?"
4914,"yes , i've heard that too . did you know that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl at this time ?"
4915,i would think there would be more than one at this time ! ! who knew ? left handed people are special ! !
4916,"another interesting fact is that the circular huddle used in today's american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so that the other team could not read his hand signals . amazing ."
4917,"very good idea , especially if your hard of hearing . do you like avocado icecream ? tom brady loves it !"
4918,it's actually very creamy and sweet if you make it correctly . go tom brady and the new england patriots . i like him . did you hear that the highest score ever in a football game occured in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 to 0 ?
4919,"really , i haven't tried it yet , but i like avocados so i think i would if there is enough sugar . hard to understand a score getting that high ! it must have seemed forever for the losing team ."
4920,"i know , right ? did you also hear that alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he entered the university as a junior ? he received his bachelor's degree in two years . that was quick !"
4921,"he must be a fast learner . maybe he's got photographic memory ! yes , go tom brady and the patriots , they have a devoted group of fans ! ! good chatt !"
4922,"thank you , i thought so too . have a great night ."
4923,"good thing that jaguars decided against cousins , he wants too much money . do you watch football ?"
4924,yes i do ! curt cousins is greed and selfish
4925,"he used to play here for the redskins . i think he is a good qb , but i'm surprised by how much salary he commands ."
4926,"well , there are not many qbs to choose from , so maybe that's why"
4927,"yeah , i can see that . it didn't make a difference for washington though . they haven't been very good since they were owned by san snyder"
4928,yeah that's for sure ! that's crazy that keelan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl
4929,"it sort of reminds me of pitchers as well . lefty's are pretty rare to begin with , and easier to bat against if you are a right hander . but still only 1 left hander in the nfl seems really small ."
4930,yup ! how about tom brady never getting to play on his hs losing season ?
4931,i didn't know that . he's a really good qb . he also is rarely injured . i think that is a big part of being successful .
4932,"definitely is ! i like blake bortles , he actually lived in the town i live in"
4933,"he's pretty good . i live in the dc area , it is not uncommon to see the players out at some of the local sports bars . i've seen cousins out multiple times ."
4934,oh that's cool ! i would love to see a female kicker in the nfl
4935,it would be interesting . i'm sure there are probably a few qualified candidates .
4936,i am sure too ! can you believe only 11 minutes of actual playing time ?
4937,"yeah , i can believe it . the plays happen pretty quickly . when i was in high school there was a girl on the football team ."
4938,oh yeah ? my high school had a girl on the team and a boy on the cheerleader team ! lol
4939,george w . bush was a male cheerleader for his college i think . i didn't know that engineer's make more than the average mlb player . nfl i can believe .
4940,"well , they need to do a better job at spreading out their salaries over time instead of living in access"
4941,"yeah , i also think they don't save and invest their earnings properly over time and it hurts them in the long run . clinton portis now drives an uber here around in dc ."
4942,really ? wow . . . talk about poor money management ! funny how a saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if a saints player comes in
4943,"yeah , they have all kinds of rules like that for cheerleaders . one the players here in dc , chris cooley , got in trouble for marrying a cheerleader from the team ."
4944,crazy ! well i am out . . . been fun ! take care ! go eeagles ! ! ! ! lol
4945,are you familiar with football and the nfl ?
4946,"love football but don't get to watch it at all , hoping to see some of the sb this sunday"
4947,so you must know that the nfl is one of the four major professional sports league in north america
4948,i did i also heard there no written rule that keeps women from playing .
4949,"indeed , i was especially surprised the average nfl game only has 11 min of live gameplay"
4950,that's crazy for how much revenue it generates . now i hear there going to be using tracking chips in the players .
4951,"well i admit there sure is a lot of action in those short , yet long 11 minutes . i think the chips will help coaches gather data to make better plays and better understand football , especially since they are putting chips in the very footballs themselves ."
4952,i understand the football but what's the deal with the need to put them in shoulder pads .
4953,"so they can see how players tend to move around the field , if there is gaps in the formation or how they can improve i guess ."
4954,well ok ! something about tracking chips makes a little nervy . did you know that the circular huddle was created for a deaf quaterback ?
4955,"i only recently found out myself . however , what stunned me the most was the the cheerleaders of the new orlean saints are forbidden from eating in the same restaurants as any nfl players . i wonder why ?"
4956,i assume that's to deter them from fraternizing . can't do that if your forced to leave the restaurant .
4957,ya but i wonder if there was an incident for them to be so extreme about it . you don't see other teams having such rules
4958,"probably was and they nipped it in the bud before the public got a hold to it . seems being an engineer is pretty lucrative , even more so than an nfl or mlb player over there lifetime ."
4959,but i think you have to consider that most players probably work for far less years than engineers .
4960,"yeah true that , still an honest profession . i wonder how much more they have to work to be consider having made more money ?"
4961,"hmmm a great question . in any case , give your interest in football , what position do you like ? personally , i am most interested in the quarterbacks"
4962,"apparently kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl , that's strange ."
4963,quite a coincidence . i wonder if being left handed as a quarterback is advantageous or disadvantageous . this would really matter given that quarterbacks are the core of the team's offense .
4964,"yeah your right . i just remember as a kid hating that the ball spun the wrong way , haha ! iowa's coach had the visitors locker room painted pink ."
4965,"in any case , this was a pleasant conversation about football . i hope you get to see some of sb this sunday and thank you for the chat ."
4966,are you familiar with the nfl ? it's the most professional level of american football .
4967,a little bit . the nfl allows women to play .
4968,there is no rule that prevent female players to join the nfl .
4969,i wonder if women will join .
4970,i don't know . i would not encourage women to join the nfl . the sports are very rough and physical .
4971,a lot of players get concussions .
4972,it's true . their quarterbacks are paid a lot . they must be good players and leaders .
4973,"yes , but engineers tend to make more ."
4974,i do not think so . the new qb for 49ers is paid 135 million dollars for a fiveyear contract .
4975,not all players make that much . alex smith was a junior when he entered college .
4976,he is a very smart guy . he got his bachelor degree in two years .
4977,"yeah , some junior colleges offer programs like that for free to high school students ."
4978,alex smith took many ap classes at high school .
4979,he was smart . a deaf quarterback invented the huddle .
4980,i heard about it . he did not want the other team to read his hand signals .
4981,i wonder if they could . sign language is hard to learn .
4982,"if i were a professional team and there was a need to understand sign language , i would probably hire a translator ."
4983,"never thought of that . even now , translators make a lot of money ."
4984,true . do you know that baker mayfield from university of oklahoma considered quitting football ?
4985,i don't blame him . it's a dangerous sport .
4986,he wanted to pursue competitive gaming instead . he was very good at playing halo 3 .
4987,you can get paid to do that ?
4988,i really do not know how mayfield planned to make more money by quitting football .
4989,interesting . it was nice talking to you . good night .
4990,hey there what do you think about the dallas cowboys . do you think they have a chance this year ?
4991,"hello there , i was hoping they would have made it further this past season , we'll see though . are you a cowboys fan ?"
4992,yeah i like the cowboys a little bit . the quarterback cam newton is a good guy . i do think the redskins are a formidable team though .
4993,"yeah he is , and the redskins have been up and down the last decade or so ."
4994,well who's your favorite quarterback ? i know that i really like tom brady personally
4995,"tom brady will go down as one of the best , if not the best . i was always a big brett favre fan ."
4996,"oh i agree with you ! i think a lot of quarterbacks are actually really talented , like alex smith , he passed out of a lot of classes in college because he did so well on the aps"
4997,yeah it sounds like alex smith could have gone into plenty of different fields if he didn't choose football .
4998,"yeah i agree , he almost got a master's degree before he went into the draft , what do you think about the circular huddle ? did you know it was invented by a deaf quarterback ?"
4999,i think that is one of the most interesting and coolest facts about pro football !
5000,"yeah i agree with you , i used to play a lot of video games in college and apparently baker mayfield was almost a professional video game player , i didn't know that ."
5001,"i didn't know that either , i think he is really good at one game in particular as well , do you know which one ?"
5002,"yeah it was halo 3 . i was actually also good at that game haha . if only we went to the same college i could have played him , maybe i should have been a professional videogame player lol"
5003,"that is hilarious , i used to play a lot of halo 1 and 2 back when i was in college . ohhhh halo 2 and milwaukee's best light beer . lol"
5004,"haha yes those were the days ! i was the best at halo 1 and halo 2 , but i did play halo 3 , i actually did win some tournaments for halo 1 . what would you think if you entered a locker room and it was painted pink btw ?"
5005,"that must have been really fun to play in those . yeah i think i have heard that before , that is hilarious !"
5006,"yeah if it's at the university of iowa , they painted the opposing team's locker room pink . i wonder if that increase or decrease their winning percentage afterwards though ? it would make me play harder"
5007,"that is a very good question , and i want to know who gave the final ok for them to do that !"
5008,what other games are you good at ? are you good at bowling at all ? they used to make more than professional football players back in the 60s
5009,"i can bowl a little bit , but that just goes to show how far the nfl has come since then !"
5010,i agree ! do you ever watch football on tv ? i like knowing that espn won and emmy for the yellow line that shows first down during games
5011,i had no idea women could be in the nfl . did you ?
5012,"i had no clue as well ! i am learning so much from these chat hits ! i dont keep up with football in generall , do you ? do you have a favorite team ?"
5013,not really but most of my friends are into it . it seems a bit boring . 11 minutes of game play on average seems small .
5014,"yeah . i like going to football games , the enviornment is really exciting . watching it on tv is really boring . my whole family loves football . im not really into it either . this is interesting though : nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
5015,wow ! that i was unaware of . although it makes sense as technology can help figure out what they need to work on . probably why they get paid so much but apparently an engineer makes more in a lifetime than a pro baller .
5016,"wow , that is crazy considering football players are pretty much putting their health and safety at risk all the time ."
5017,i know . kind of funny that its the quarterback that gets the most attention when the others seem to put more wear and tear on their bodies .
5018,"right ! except this , its pretty impressive : superbowl winning quarterback , brad johnson , is the only quarterback in nfl history to throw a touchdown pass . . . to himself ."
5019,how is that even possible ? i just found out that the huddle was created because a deaf quarterback could give hand signals without the other team seeing . personally i am more impressed that he is deaf .
5020,thats insane . but thats nice that the nfl was willing to make a huddle to accomodate that player !
5021,"yeah , that was pretty cool of them . do you watch any college ball ?"
5022,"not at all ! i only watch the 49ers games and the superbowl . but really i know nothing about the game , i just cheer when i hear ' touchdown '"
5023,"yeah , i dont either . i read once that nfl cheerleaders dont get paid by the nfl although im not sure how true that is ."
5024,"right , they dont even get paid for expenses for traveling to the game , i think . they get paid from some cheerleading organization . i knew a cheerleading coach . that seems hard as a career ."
5025,"apparently new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden to be seen eating in the same restaurant as a player and if a player comes in a restaurant they are eating at , the cheerleader has to leave . that seems rude to me ."
5026,"wow , whats the deal with that ? i thought we were past segregation . lol"
5027,"lol ! i know , right ? i actually was at a dennys once when a saints player came in with his agent after a game . didnt see any cheerleaders though and to be honest , wasnt all that impressed ."
5028,"did you know , those humongous american flags at football stadiums weigh 1 , 100 pounds and cost 50 , 000 to make . really ? thats crazy amount of money to spend on a flag ."
5029,that is insane ! i wonder where they get them from .
5030,"probably etsy , haha . yeah im not sure . just a ridiculous fact about football lol"
5031,"i hear ya ! well , have a good night !"
5032,"hi , how are you over there ? are you feeling good ?"
5033,"hi ! yes , pretty great thank you ! just finished watching some football videos . are you a fan of football ?"
5034,"i do not usually watch the football . it is violence , and my household does not truck with violence on tv , only in person ."
5035,haha ! i agree it is a very aggressive sport . which got me wondering why i hadn't seen any female football players did you know there are currently no written rules against female players in the nfl .
5036,"i think that violence against women would be an queer spectator sport , even in america . is there a sport with violence against the women ?"
5037,"um , no i don't think so , but did you know an average nfl game is only 11 minutes of gameplay ?"
5038,thats scandalous . therre should be some sort of law about minimal work time or something .
5039,"yes , it makes me ponder how much times have changed . back in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
5040,how much money was that exactly ? i dont think either of them groups made much . i guess the bowlers got all the women and the glory though . they were graceful ahtletes .
5041,"im not sure , but yes there seems to be a lot of irregularities within the sport for instance new orleans saints cheerleaders are not allowed to be in the same restaurants as any of the players ."
5042,i think thats a sexist form of misogyny or seomething along those lines . the men should be chivalrous and leave the women .
5043,"to each their own i suppose , speaking of lines , that super imposed yellow line you see in the game , espn has won an emmy for that . did know that was possible ."
5044,i think espn should try to put a line where the cheerleaders are so that they dont have problems with players . that would be chivalrous of espn . what does espn stand for ?
5045,"i think people should just have some common sense but i don't see that happening anytime soon . the nfl uses tracking devices to track players on the field , im sure that a way to keep tabs on players"
5046,i think they could track them off the field too . too many of them guys get into all kinds of criminal mischief . they need some help .
5047,"in that case the whole world would be tracked , i think we can think of better ways than to ' control '"
5048,"nfl players are role models for many young people . i am not . i cannot speak for you . i figure that if they don't get into trouble , they dont need tracking . but some of them , . . i dunno ."
5049,"thats a whole other subject we dont have enough time here for . but this would be a whole different place if more love was implemented the current system has people going crazy and violence is out of hand , we must look within oneself ."
5050,i suppose that we are running out of time . the nfl should invent a chip to help up look within ourselves not just track each other . what is inside ? chips might just help us there .
5051,"i disagree , we have everything we need to look within ourself . . . you would just be giving your power away by allowing to get chipped . someone else in control of you and your decision . this plante would no longer be free will . the nfl should just stick with tracking balls to track speed and rotation"
5052,"i feel lost sometimes and am willing to try the chips . i trust the science of the soul . anyway , thanks for the heart to heart chat . peace ."
5053,"meditate , i feel the same way ! but have found answers looking within , you need nothing else , change your vibration and your outlook in life and life will reciprocate . itll be challenging but its worth it . then and only then you will be free . nice chatting with you too ! namaste . in love and light ."
5054,"i love football , but not a big fan of the panthers . how about you ? are you a fan of the nfl ?"
5055,i dont know the game very well . you dont like the panthers ? why not ?
5056,"well , im not just not a fan of the quarterback cam's attitude . although their offense is on point lately ."
5057,i guess the quarterback is the most prominent person on the team . he sets the tone of a lot of things .
5058,"what it amounts to is he really only had a couple of exceptional season . he convinced everyone he is superman , that is his nickname ."
5059,so he is past his peak . didnt his team play in the superbowl recently ? i think i remember they lost .
5060,they based everything on a guy who cant hold his temper . he acts out when he cant throw and blames others .
5061,so much of the game's success depends on personality and integrity . cant teach that . either you got it or you dont .
5062,"yep , i agree with you . some people like cam are not ready for the long career . turner began to take the pressure off cam by scheming more throws to the running backs ."
5063,"you gotta work with the players you have , not the ones you want . the nfl is an interesting study in personality . i wonder how women would fare in the nfl ."
5064,"yeah , good question . ya know the nfl does not have a rule against women playing ."
5065,"ive heard as much . i figure if a woman could do the job , theyd hire her . i just dont think it will happen ."
5066,i think anything is possible but no women have met the leagues eligibility requirements yet . the size of the men are so big it would have to be a really amazon type of women .
5067,"yes , maybe genetic engineering will help us out there . it will be like starship troopers . that would be fun ."
5068,"oh yeah , ha cool . ya know the new orleans saints cheerleaders can not be at the same restaurant with the football players . if they are in the same place the cheerleaders have to leave immediately . wow"
5069,"that rule must come from somewhere , but i cant figure out where . was there a problem with romantic relationships ? strange outdated rule ."
5070,"oh yeah , that's a good point . maybe it has something to do with that . i know that games go by too fast for me , being a big fan , i want to see more play time ."
5071,"yeah , i hear you . 11 minutes sounds like a rip off . i figure that the union got involved ! lol"
5072,"haha , i want the whole two and a half hours of play time . alex smith is such a good qb that he might extend the games with how smart he is . he was able to get his bachelors in two years . it usually takes four years ."
5073,"yeah , he really was bright and focused . more students should do that and get through faster . anyway , great chat !"
5074,"i know and i agree with the fact that the players need to focus on education and football . baker mayfield almost took it too far by focusing on gaming and wasn't gonna go for football but rather try to be a professional gamer , gesh . lol . have a good one ."
5075,i have an article about football . you ?
5076,i'm a fan of football . i could do with less commercials though . they have like 11 minues of live gameplay in the average broadcast .
5077,isn't that crazy ? the junpero serra high school jv football team recorded a historically bad season in which they failed to win a game or even score a touchdown yet they never attempted to start their backup quarterback .
5078,yeah he was tom brady . weird .
5079,"it's crazy ! alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a junior . the quarterback received his bachelor's degree in two years , and began working on a master's degree , before becoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft ."
5080,smart guy . speaking of college the university of iowa has a pink locker room . i think you'd always remember that one .
5081,"yes , you would know what to expect ! the circular huddle used in todays american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not read his hand signals ."
5082,innovative . the nfl tracks everything with chips embedded in the players pads .
5083,"they like to get alot of info ! the quarterback is usually considered the leader of the offensive team , and is often responsible for calling the play in the huddle ."
5084,did you know there's only one lefthanded quarterback in the nfl ?
5085,"no ! the quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive play , and is the offensive player that almost always throws forward passes ."
5086,"that's a lot of responsibility . baker mayfield , qvb and oklahoma , almost quit football to be a professional video gamer . i wonder if he played madden at all ?"
5087,"no idea ! sports commonly called football in certain places include association football , known as soccer in some countries , ; gridiron football , specifically american football or canadian football , ; australian rules football ; rugby football , either rugby league or rugby union , ; and gaelic football"
5088,interesting . there are a lot of definitions . i'm assuming they all kick a ball at some point .
5089,me too ! former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
5090,nice hands ! i wonder if frisky hands is why new orleans cheerleaders and the football team can't eat at the same restaurant .
5091,"thats a good question ! : ,"
5092,sometimes wish i could get more games than the 16 games in the nfl season .
5093,i think alot of people feel that way . espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games .
5094,very cool . i wonder if any women will ever play in the nfl . there's nothing in the rules that says they can't .
5095,that would be fun to see ! different variations of football are known as football codes .
5096,yeah it would . i think there's more money as an engineer though over your lifetime .
5097,what nfl team does colt mccoy currently play for ?
5098,mccoy plays for washington . he has been in washington for years .
5099,how much did he sign for in his most recent extension ?
5100,he could get up to 7 million dollars . not bad for being a backup .
5101,"not at all ! there was some sort of playing clause in it , wasn't there ?"
5102,i sure there are some playing incentives to get to the full 7 million .
5103,i thought there was something about mccoy possibly becoming a free agent .
5104,"he has stuck with the redskins through rgiii and kirk cousins , and is now behind alex smith . he seems happy there ."
5105,"i suppose so , particularly after being drafted by cleveland ? do you remember which year that happened ?"
5106,2010 maybe . mccoy is one of about a zillion qb's drafted by the browns .
5107,that's pretty funny ! he went somewhere else before coming to washington . do you know where ?
5108,he also spent some time in sf . but he is happy now with the redskins and coach jay gruden .
5109,"i can see that , although he wants to be a starter . his 2014 run wasn't great though . know any of his stats from that year ?"
5110,mccoy was 13 as a starter in 2014 . there is a reason he is a backup .
5111,"true , although you never know . have you heard about the junipero serra high school jv backup qb ?"
5112,"yes , it's the high school that refused to start tom brady , even though they failed to score a touchdown the entire season ."
5113,pretty amazing ! how many teams are in the national football league anyway ?
5114,"there are 32 teams , divided evenly into the national football conference , nfc , and the american football conference , afc , ."
5115,"after a 17week season , the playoffs end this week before their big game . what is it called again ?"
5116,"some call it the super bowl . but if your a commercial business and haven't signed a licensing agreement with the nfl , you have to call it ' the big game ' . ha !"
5117,"that's pretty funny ! a long way from the 1960's , when bowlers made twice as much as football stars ! thanks for all this great information !"
5118,hello !
5119,"hi , how are you ?"
5120,"doing well , and yourself ?"
5121,"very well , thanks . do you enjoy football ?"
5122,i do ! did you watch the super bowl last night ?
5123,i did ! although i did fall asleep during the 4th quarter and woke up when trophy was being handed out . . . did you watch ?
5124,lol ! can't say i blame you it wasn't an overly exciting game
5125,it wasn't . . . the glass of whiskey might have helped my sleep . . . did you watch it ?
5126,i did i wasn't even a huge fan of the commercials which is normally my favorite part
5127,i thought they were just ok too . who were you rooting for ?
5128,anyone but the patriots lol so rams last night . normally i am more of a mn person
5129,"uh oh . . . i am from chicago so we have an nfc north friction . just kidding , we are united by our hatred of green bay !"
5130,"haha , yes ! mutual hatred always makes for entertainment ! did you have any favorite commercials ?"
5131,i liked the nfl 100 . it's' the only one that really stood out to me . plus my kids were watching next to me and talked the entire time . . .
5132,ah yeah that would definitely make it tough . have you paid any attention to some of the nfl rule changes over the last couple of years ?
5133,yeah . what do you have in mind . . .
5134,what are your thoughts on the new helmet rule when making contact ?
5135,my head understands it but my heart wants to see bone crushing hits . at the same time seeing the older nfl players struggle in daily life is tough . . .
5136,"yeah , i agree . it's kind of like going to a hockey game and they can only slap each other lol . similar thoughts on the roughing the passer changes ?"
5137,the qbs are protected pretty well so i would like to see some rules to help the def . . .
5138,that's an interesting thought i've never thought about it from the other side . do you have anything specific in mind ?
5139,"not really but there are times when the def is flagged for a simple hit that should not be flagged . any way , thank you so much for the chat . i really enjoyed this one . i hope we get paired in the future . . ."
5140,do you like football ?
5141,i do like football ! do you ?
5142,"i do , in what conference is your favorite team ?"
5143,"nfc north , the bears . yours ?"
5144,"afc east , patriots , are you watching the superbowl this year ?"
5145,"nice . . . yeah , i will be watching it . i guess i do not have to ask who you are rooting for ?"
5146,"patriots for sure lol , too bad the bears didnt make it , im counting the days for sunday ."
5147,what are you doing for the game
5148,gathering with friends what about you ? doing anything special ?
5149,"no , i love to cook game day food so i will cook some wings and gumbo or jambalaya and eat that . i do not like watching with people because they ask me too many questions . i like to use the commercial breaks to relax , get food or go potty and everyone wants to watch those instead and i get yelled at to sit down so i stopped being social for that game ."
5150,"yeah i get you , it can be stressful specially if your gathering at your home , you know the saints cheerleaders have to leave if a player arrives to a restaurant ."
5151,seems sexist ! are you staying at your place or going somewhere else ?
5152,"staying at my place , but its only a few of us so i dont think it would be stressful ."
5153,that's nice . my wife loves to have people over for the games but hates the games . seems weird to me but she just into having fun .
5154,"thats funny lol , i bet she doesnt know about the tracking chips players have in their shoulder pads , thats a cool fact i will share sunday for sure ."
5155,she doesn't know about those chips but she knows about doritos and fritos ! ! ! so good . . .
5156,"i guess thats a better thing to know lol , you know the average gameplay is of only 11 minutes ! !"
5157,that's a short time . kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl .
5158,really ? i would have thought there were at least a couple more !
5159,"yeah , me too . do you like baker mayfield ?"
5160,"i do like him , i think he is a great player ."
5161,me too ! nice chatting with you and good luck this weekend !
5162,did you know that there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl .
5163,"wow , only one impressive , i am left handed and i would be a minority in the nfl"
5164,"yes indeed , lol . do you know who baker mayfield is ?"
5165,i have . i think he is the qb from the university of oklahoma
5166,indeed he thought at one time to leave football for competitive gaming . apparently he had a favorite game . do you know it ?
5167,he was pretty good in halo 3 . . . by the way do you know how the circular huddle was created ?
5168,i though it was so the other player couldn't see what the qb was saying .
5169,it was created by a deaf qb paul d hubbard ! !
5170,oh ok that makes sense as well . you know theres no written rule that prevents women from playing in the nfl ?
5171,"wow , i wonder if any women had tried ! ! they could earn more money by being engineers !"
5172,"yeah over the long haul , i would rather do 1015 years on the field and leave with my millions than 40 plus . what about you ?"
5173,exactly i would do the same as you ! hey did you know what they did in the university of iowa visitors locker room ?
5174,too funny somebody told me that the looker room is painted pink . that would just make me mad .
5175,"that is funny intimidation , more like a joke !"
5176,right i think they thought they were going to intermediate the other team . you know the average game only has 11 minutes of live game play ?
5177,"wow , sounds too short . . but the whole show with the stops is very enjoyable to me and now is more interesting with data that is tracked by chips"
5178,yeah and the tracking chips are in the shoulder pads as well . soon will be watching a . i . 's playing .
5179,looks like we are going in that direction ! did you know bowlers earned more than football players in the 60's ?
5180,yeah i was told twice as much that's crazy ! how about the rule about new orleans cheerleaders . have you heard about this sexist thing ?
5181,it is terrible ! ! they cannot eat where any nfl players eat ! !
5182,right and if there already eating and a player comes in then they got to get a doggy bag .
5183,awful ! ! so unfair . that should not be happening !
5184,do you know who played the highest scoring college game in history ?
5185,that was more than 100 years ago ! it was georgia tech and cumberland
5186,yup 2200 that hurts i would have hated to be on the bus ride home .
5187,that is so sad for cumberland ! ! well it has been a nice chat !
5188,it was have good day !
5189,"who do you like better , the falcons or redskins ?"
5190,"i am not really a football fan , how about you ?"
5191,"i like football , but i'm not as big of a fan as i used to be . . . i play fantasy football a lot though , so i follow the league pretty closely ."
5192,interesting . i heard in the season that the redskins won three and a row after a terrible loss to the saints
5193,"yeah , the redskins are a good team . they have a running back named adrian peterson who is very good . at one time he was the best player in the league , but is now old and close to retirement ."
5194,he is the nfl's leading rusher and wasn't even in the team's plans until late august . he's a big part of the offense .
5195,"yes he is ; do you feel washington's offense is good enough to keep up with matt ryan , julio jones , and the rest of atlanta's high powered offense ?"
5196,i have no idea but redskins secondary has struggled against the pass . i've heard that but not sure what that means . can you enlighten me ?
5197,"sure , atlanta has one of the best quarterbacks in the league , matt ryan . he is very good at passing the ball . unfortunately , washington has a very poor defense and are not able to defend against teams that pass the ball well . the ' secondary ' are the defensive players responsible for defending the pass ."
5198,"wow , thank you for the explanation . apparently washington recently made a trade to boost its defensive backfield , to get safety ha ha clintondix ."
5199,"yes , he came over to washington from green bay . since washington's defense was so poor , they decided to trade for clintondix , who is very good at defending against a passing offense . unfortunately , quinton dunbar is injured with a nerve issue in his lower leg . i'm not sure if clintondix will be enough to stop atlanta ."
5200,"yeah , i heard he is a physical defender who can fly to the ball and kind of limit atlanta's receivers' comfort ."
5201,"even though atlanta will be passing the ball a lot , i suspect washington will primarily run the ball . atlanta has been struggling this season and washington is very good at running the football ."
5202,"if the redskins let ryan stand in their pocket , it might be a challenge for them ."
5203,do you understand what it means to ' stand in the pocket ? '
5204,i have a slight idea but perhaps you can enlighten me again !
5205,"when a quarterback has the ball and wanting to pass it to a receiver , he has five teammates on the offensive line that is protecting him from being tackled . the barrier these five offensive lineman create is called ' the pocket . ' if they do their job , the quarterback can stay inside of the pocket and deliver a good pass . if not , he will have to try to run and get away ."
5206,you are awesome at explaining things . maybe if you were around on game days i could actually understand football ! i only watch durign the super bowl . i guess i will wait to watch my next game the first sunday of next february .
5207,"football can be somewhat intimidating to try and understand , but the rules are fairly easy . knowing that there are no rules against women playing in the nfl , do you ever think a woman will play ?"
5208,i actually read about a woman kicker who is playing on the men's college football team . maybe she is our next hope .
5209,it would be fun to see a woman in the nfl . the kicker is a good position for the first woman to play . they rarely get tackled and have rules protecting how hard they can get hit . i still feel that a very strong woman could play another position and tackle just as well as the men could .
5210,"i hope so . the nfl seems a bit sexist though . i know football players are more important but still , when new orleans saints cheerleaders are already eating in a restaurant , they have to leave if saints players come into the restaurant ."
5211,hello are you a football fan ?
5212,hi how are you ? sometimes i follow football . you ?
5213,i do a little bit . did you know the highest score in a football game was 2220 nothing . thats a lot of points .
5214,what happened there ? the winning coach should be ashamed . what is the point of that drubbing ?
5215,that is crazy . you never know though . he may have put his third string in and they were still just way better .
5216,"yeah , that's true . i wonder why cumberland scheduled that game . no point ."
5217,i bet they didnt schedule it again for awhile . lol . in the 1960s top bowlers made more than football stars . that i really hard to believe .
5218,the nfl was just starting out and i guess the fan base was not big enough . plus the players probably didnt have a union
5219,"i jut cant see bowling being something people would really watch . it is fun to play , but i dont know about watching ."
5220,"i guess the fans followed the sport because they played as well . probably a lot of local leagues , and that raised interest in pros ."
5221,hey espn one a emmy for the yellow line that shows where first down is .
5222,that is amazing ! an award for a line ? must have been a soft year for awards . lol
5223,it was a really good idea . it will probably still be being used when every actor alive today is dead .
5224,"yes , it is a standard part of the broadcast . i cant imagine the game without the superimposed graphics ."
5225,it sure i . so what do you think about the university of iowa painting the visting locker room pink ?
5226,"i figure that it has some effect , but is it enough to matter ? if so , then every team would do it ."
5227,so no rule about women in football . do you think it will ever happen ?
5228,i wonder . maybe at some positions that would be ok ? like kicker or punter ?
5229,"maybe . there is only about 11 minutes of actual gameplay . kicker is , what ? 1 percent of that ?"
5230,"yeah , not much contact for the kicker . probably pretty safe at the high school level too . anyway , great chat !"
5231,you to . have a great day .
5232,good morning to you !
5233,hi . do you like sports ? do you like football ?
5234,"i enjoy some football , are we talking about american football or european football ?"
5235,american football . especially the nfl national football league . do you have a favorite team of the 32 ?
5236,"i do , i root for the pats . how about you ?"
5237,i do not know much about football . i do know about the patriots . i learned that the quarterback with the most wins was ben roethlisberger for the pittsburgh steelers .
5238,"hes pretty good , hes been a team staples for as long as i can remember . hes a great qb"
5239,i learned that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl . i thought there would be more .
5240,i wonder why that is . do you think it has to do with how they have to turn their body to throw ?
5241,that is a great point . i did not think of it that way . there is a quarterback who threw a touchdown pass to himself !
5242,imagine how cool that would look ? i bet he felt so bad ass when he did that
5243,and did you know that there are only 2 african american quarterbacks to have won the superbowl ?
5244,which is surprising to me because the nfl is pretty diverse . did you know there is nothing in the rules that says a woman cant play ?
5245,that is great to know that anyone can play . even a rocket scientist is coaching in the nfl .
5246,i bet he some pretty great ideas and strategies for his team !
5247,i bet he knows a lot about the humongous american flags at the stadium that weigh 1100 pounds .
5248,is that how much that thing weighs ? good god i cant imagine seeing what it looks like all folded up !
5249,"yes and they cost 50 , 000 dollars to make ! that is one hefty flag !"
5250,50k ? ? ? ? im in the wrong business !
5251,well thanks so much for chatting . i learned a lot about football today .
5252,"likewise , take care"
5253,do you watch the nfl ? i think it is the best form of any of the different types of football !
5254,hi ! i do watch when i can but yes i love the nfl .
5255,awesome ! i am not a huge ravens fan but i think that it would be interesting if flacco was replaced by lamar jackson .
5256,i agree ! lamar jackson is a great quarterback and that would be a great fit !
5257,yeah definitely would be fun to watch . i think quarterbacks get a lot of publicity because they are essentially the offensive leader .
5258,"definitely ! lamar jackson has a really impressive record , he rushed 1 , 500 yards and and pass for over 3 , 000 yards in a season to name a few !"
5259,yeah and winning the heisman trophy is no easy feat either ! the ravens playbook should cater to jacksons strengths .
5260,"my thoughts exactly , the nfl should be proud to have him as a quarterback . he will be introduced into some new schemes they have going so he will be even better ."
5261,yeah . i also enjoy football because it is a family sport . it's crazy that there is only 11 minutes of actual action in an nfl game .
5262,"it is a great family sport , and true so little actual live play for so many hours in a game . i like to watch the quarterbacks the most , tom brady is also fantastic ."
5263,"yeah tom brady is a champ , definitely one of the greats ! apparently the circular huddle was developed for a deaf quarterback . interesting that it stuck ."
5264,"i read about that , pretty amazing and smart ! football and the nfl history is full of fun facts !"
5265,yeah . and there is only one left handed quarterbackkellan moore . must not be that much of a good thing otherwise there would be more !
5266,i would think being left handed in football would be very challenging . i wonder if the tracking devices are the same when placed in a left handers shoulder pads .
5267,good question . baker mayfield almost quit football to be a competitive gamer can you believe that ? these players are so talented in many things .
5268,right ? they have options which is great . i find it interesting that an engineer makes more money in their lifetime than an nfl player . . . . crazy !
5269,yeah that is surprising . engineers are really smart but i still would want to be an nfl player . just more fun and exciting even if i make less money .
5270,"true ! although being an nfl player your chances of injry are so high and you can't play that hard for too many years . i also heard that pro bowlers made twice the money as a football player years ago hahaa , weird !"
5271,haha bowling is definitely fun but i would never guess it would be lucrative . i wonder how much they make nowadays ?
5272,"i agree ! do they even have pro bowling anymore ? lol , haven't seen that in awhile . i will stick to watching the nfl haha"
5273,haha same . well it was nice talking with you ! have a great night !
5274,"case keenum , the next broncos quarterback . he had a great year for the vikings in 2017 ."
5275,he has a cool name . i hope he performs up to his name for elway's broncos !
5276,"he's been mediocre his whole career , then had a career season with minnesota ."
5277,makes you wonder why the vikings passed on making him their franchise player .
5278,i think they believe 2017 was a fluke . minnesota has its eyes on kirk cousins .
5279,"so keenum moves on with free agency , just like his fellow vikings , bradford and bridgewatertwo other cool names ."
5280,"denver was loaded with mediocre qb's in 2017 , too . siemian , lynch , osweiler ."
5281,"yeah , and they traded up in the 2016 draft to get lynch , and that did not work out for them ."
5282,"looks like denver won't draft a qb for 2018 with keenum in hand . that will be good for the bills , who are trading up ."
5283,"ah , the bills . searching for that fifth super bowl loss . just like elway said about dencer , buffalo needs to get better at that spot too , qb that is , ."
5284,you need a good quarterback to do well . look at how denver has fared since peyton manning retired .
5285,true . brings a tear to my eye remembering elway and manning in the orange jersey . .
5286,"gm elway thinks the broncos are close , and keenum could put them in super bowl contention ."
5287,yeah . i guess the nfl will be putting a chip in keenums shoulder pads in denver soon to monitor his position on the field . hopefully he will stay in denver long enough to make it on the field .
5288,or maybe denver will use keenum to groom a new young quarterback .
5289,"that could happen . the orange could use matt patricia as coach , the only rocket scientist in the nfl ."
5290,"yes , the nfl takes all kinds . there are no rules against women playing ."
5291,"yeah . if patricia writes the plays , he takes inspiration from his old rpi fight song , where they mention such footballsavvy terms as sine , cosine , and tangent ."
5292,maybe patricia should have stuck with rocket science . engineers earn more lifetime than the average nfl player .
5293,"yeah , and if you have a bad record , it lives in statistical infamy forever . like the poor cleveland browns . the qb with the most wins in their stadium is not even from their own team , but from their rivals , the steeler's roethlisberger ."
5294,"maybe the browns can get baker mayfield . he is excellent at competitive gaming , and might make their game competitive ."
5295,"hi there , do you watch the nfl ?"
5296,"yup . i don't know why , but i do enjoy this game . 32 teams doesn't seem like enough ."
5297,yeah i know . did you know women can play if they qualify ?
5298,"yeah . which conference do you think will be the first to have a woman , afc or nfc"
5299,"i wonder about that , we will have to wait and see i guess . do you know there are only 11 minutes of game play ?"
5300,"17 grueling weeks , wild card weekend , the playoffs , and then the superbowl , and all of them only 11 minutes each . doesn't sound super . . ."
5301,i know . did you hear about that rule with new orleans cheerleaders ?
5302,"yeah , what ; s the deal with that ? doesn't sound fair . but neither does having to wear tracking chips to monitor your every move ! nfl even puts those chips in the balls to measure speed , rotation , etc . sounds a bit overkill for 11 minutes . . ."
5303,"yeah when you think of it that way . and that rule is so sexist , i wonder how they still get away with it"
5304,"the league is not made up of rocket scientists . . . well , except for matt patricia . . ."
5305,yeah talk about a career change . do you know what the highest score in football is ?
5306,"are we talking about cheerleaders again ? the high school stadium in allen , tx seats 18 , 000 and costs about 60 million . how is that for a score ?"
5307,"wow that is a lot of money . the highest score was actually 2220 , what a win and a loss at the same time"
5308,i wish i had a recording of that game ! you know those huge flags that display in stadiums can weigh as much as 1100 lbs ? it probably takes the whole team to put them away each night . . .
5309,wow that is super heavy . u of iowa visitor locker room is actually painted pink i wonder why ?
5310,to hide the pigskin ? lol you know snoop dog wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team ? that will get the crowd rocking !
5311,that s for sure . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
5312,"what for ? let me guess , they were acting like they knew what they were talking about ? brad johnson deserves an emmy . . . he is the only superbowl winning qb to have thrown a pass to himself !"
5313,i would have liked to see that actually . they won it for the yellow superimposed line
5314,"ok . i accept that . just like brad accepted his own pass , and then scored a touchdown ! see me doing my end zone dance ?"
5315,haha yeah he must have made headlines with that . it was nice chatting with you
5316,"hi , how are you doing ?"
5317,great . are you a football fan ?
5318,why yes i am . how about you ?
5319,did you know that alex smith took so many ap classes that he entered college as a junior ? smart quarterback !
5320,"no , i didn't know that , but it's probably a good thing he went to college . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player ."
5321,omg ! and the injuries ! tom brady is an amazing qb but in high school he was the back up that didnt get to play . i am sure that coach is sorry now !
5322,"yeah , i bet that coach has taken alot of ribbing over the years about not playing the goat ."
5323,what does goat mean ?
5324,"greatest of all time , tom brady . 4 time superbowl champion lol"
5325,"ohhhh . speaking of qbs , did you know that there is only one left handed one ? kellan moore ."
5326,"yeah , i would have thought there was more than one , but hey that must give him some kind of advantage , i'm sure ."
5327,i also did not know that the huddle came from a deaf qb that didnt want the other team to read his sign language . interesting ?
5328,"yeah , that is interesting . but do you know there is a player that has never fumbled the ball in his entire nfl career ?"
5329,i cant imagine who it is ? is he playing now ?
5330,"no , former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis . must have been very hard to accomplish that ."
5331,what an accomplishment . did you know the highest score in football was georgia tech in 1916 ? they scored 222 points .
5332,"whoo , that's alot points . i don't think that would happen nowadays . i watched the superbowl and it was the lowest scoring superbowl game ever ."
5333,boring ! and a half hours and the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of gameplay . who knew ?
5334,"i know , but yet we watch anyway . lol"
5335,no wonder the announcers talk so much ! and there is no rule against women playing in the nfl . they just have to meet eligibility requirements .
5336,"that would be cool . well it's been nice chatting , i need to go walk my dog , talk to you later , friend ."
5337,i think the qb is the most important player on the filed .
5338,most definitely ! how are you today ?
5339,i am great what about you ? do you like football ?
5340,i do like football . im a steelers fan . what about you ?
5341,i do like it and also trivia do you know whats the highest score ever ?
5342,222 to 0 back in 1916 ! the losing team must have been asleep !
5343,"sleep or all blind , who loses by that much , an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of gameplay ,"
5344,apparently cumberland ! hopefully they got better since then .
5345,"i sure hope so , did you know there is no written rule in the nfl agaisnt woman playing in the league !"
5346,that is funny . do you think a woman will ever play in the nfl ? i think maybe a kicker if anything .
5347,"i dont think they will , men are stronger its just a thing of nature besides they can always get tackled as kickers"
5348,true that . crazy that rb benjarvus green ellis never fumbled once !
5349,"i heard he was a great player , never watched him play though , what teams did he play for ?"
5350,he formerly played for the patriots .
5351,"i see , well it makes sense he had a great team , i wonder how much money he made , i hear engineers will make more money than football players eventually"
5352,probably because their careers are way longer than football players i assume .
5353,"that would make sense , they do have longer careers so yeah , also football players tend to have short careers"
5354,it is surprising that only one qb in the nfl is left handed .
5355,"only one ? wow , whats his name ?"
5356,kellan moore is the only left handed player .
5357,"oh i like how he playes , great fact , anyway its been grea chatting with you i feel a lot more knowledgable about the sport now ! thanks"
5358,nice chatting with you as well !
5359,"hello there , are you a fan of the nfl ?"
5360,"yeah , i usually try to watch during the playoffs . how about you ?"
5361,yeah i follow my team during the regular season and then watch most of the playoff games .
5362,in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . i wonder which athletes were in better shape ? nobody watches bowling the same as they did then .
5363,"yeah isn't that wild , shows how much the sport has grown and bowling , well it's bowling . i guess the thing to be was a bowler in the 60's though ."
5364,the nfl has no rule against female players . do you think we'll ever see women in the game ?
5365,"i think we will , and i think that it would be really cool if that did happen ."
5366,i could see them playing positions like punter or kicker or place holder . i think those are the positions that would be most expected .
5367,"yeah i think those would be the first positions that we would see a female player . but , if one made it as a regular field player , that would be awesome ."
5368,"she'd have to be big , or fast , or both . an average nfl game has a mere 11 minutes of live gameplay . that's far less that i expected ."
5369,"yeah that seems so low , i know that you notice it a lot more when you go to live games . on tv , you don't really notice the breaks and all the stopages so much ."
5370,it would be great to see the first down line project onto the actual field . espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line . could we get it at the stadium live ?
5371,yeah i wonder when they will try and do that for the fans that attend live .
5372,"we need a clever engineer to come up with that system . an engineer's average lifetime earnings are higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player . parents , don't let your kids grow up to be athletes !"
5373,"yeah i think the duration of the career is so much shorter for pro athletes , and they just need to know how to invest their earnings correctly !"
5374,true . they could use better financial advice . maybe they could become video game players like baker mayfield . there are professional video game players .
5375,yeah i don't know if i could beat him at halo 3 but maybe halo 2 i could !
5376,why are cheerleaders prohibited from eating at the same restaurant as players ? that seems strange to me .
5377,that seems strange and really outdated to me . i think they need to think that over .
5378,"yeah , maybe they had a problem with romantic relationships between the two groups . anyway , i enjoyed chatting with you !"
5379,"yeah same here , i hope you have a good night ."
5380,are you a fan of football ? i enjoy pro but not college so much .
5381,"me too , i like college football , but i don't like the idea of it . especially how they treat their players"
5382,"i also disagree with the treatment of their players . speaking of college , did you know that the university of iowa did to the visiting locker room ?"
5383,"i didn't hear , what did they do ?"
5384,they painted it completely pink !
5385,what ! no way . do you think it was to psych out their opponents ?
5386,i would assume . so strange . have you also ever heard what the highest football score ever was ?
5387,"i did , it was an embarrassment , 2220 . wow . no mercy rule in football i guess , huh"
5388,i can't imagine that . how is it even possible to score that many points in one game ? !
5389,idk haha meanwhile we have the supervowl score not even reaching a combined 30 points ! the team with zero must have just rolled over at one point
5390,seems to be the case . did you know that espn created the yellow line that shows the first down ? can you imagine watching a game on tv without that line ?
5391,it is absolutely necessary to use . i used to think that line was on the field in real life too and they just moved it a lot . then i went to a game and didn't see it
5392,"ha ha , that's hilarious . have you ever heard of the rb benjarvus greenellis ?"
5393,the name rings a bell but i'm not sure what he did
5394,he played for the patriots . in his entire time with the patriots he never fumbled a ball !
5395,"wow , what a guy . he must have been a star . did you hear about baker mayfield ?"
5396,i did not . what about him ?
5397,apparently early on in his career he considered quitting football to pursue a professional halo 3 career . you don't hear that every day !
5398,oh wow . i suppose if he is still good that he can do it as a second career later .
5399,"that's a big maybe , i don't think the halo 3 scene is as popular anymore . i think he made the right choice for sure"
5400,who knows when it comes to competitive gaming . people still compete with starcraft and that game is old .
5401,hey ! guess how the circular huddle used in football came to be !
5402,i never knew that is how it happened but that it's really neat that it is because of a deaf quarterback so the other players could not see his hand signals
5403,yes ! i wonder how its benefitted the game outside of that . i don't actually follow football much . i've just been reading about it lately .
5404,i love football but there are a lot of things i did not know like there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl his name is kellan moore
5405,"yes ! it's surprising that there's only one , given the numbers . i wonder why ."
5406,not sure but thats cool . i also just learned that the former patriots running back has never fumbled a football in his nfl career
5407,yes ! benjarvus greenellis ! but how much time did he spend playing ? i wonder if he was really good or if he just didn't play much .
5408,lol i didnt think about that
5409,"yeah , with only 11 minutes of actual play per game , and not all of the players on the field at once , you could get through a season without being on the field for long ."
5410,true true ! did you know there were tracking devices in uniforms and in the actual football itself
5411,"yes , the nfl uses shoulder pads with embedded chips ."
5412,that's crazy i never would have guessed that and that the new orleans saints cheerleaders are not allowed to dine with the nfl players and if they are eating already the cheerleaders have to stop eating and leave . i wonder why
5413,"yeah , requiring them to leave sounds dubious . does the nfl compensate them for the meal they miss ? why not just have some kind of communication to prevent that from happening ? i mean since they have that rule to begin with ."
5414,"i agree , you're exactly right , you'd think they would have thought of that instead of drama happening if they do show up at the same spot"
5415,"yeah . today , they could just have an app where players and cheerleaders check into a restaurant . they wouldn't have to communicate with each other , which is probably the point . it would be interesting to interview players and cheerleaders about what they think of that rule ."
5416,yeah it would be the smart thing to do and there are apps for taking your dog out for a walk so you think they would have one for that
5417,"yeah . they could use an existing app , like google maps , for example . i can see potential issues with the having to leave thing , like if someone wasn't compensated for a meal they didn't get to eat or if there was some kind of health issue involved ? it just seems like something that would lead to problems ."
5418,absolutely i wonder why they do that like if the team had some type of problems with the cheerleaders stalking or something
5419,"yeah . i guess the point is so that the players and cheerleaders don't get too friendly with each other so the cheerleaders aren't a distraction from the players' significant others , so everyone stays professional during the game , to avoid harassment of the cheerleaders or vice versa , stuff like that ."
5420,you think that would be for all the teams not just one team out of how many
5421,yeah . and people should be trusted to behave responsibly once they have such a prestigious job .
5422,they should be trusted to act prestigiously regardless of there job but people are human and we all mess up some more then others unfortunately
5423,"yes . but with a job where you're in the public eye and there's fierce competition to get there , people should be expected to hold themselves to certain standards and if they do something out of line like harassing a cheerleader just let them go and let someone else take their place ."
5424,yes you're right about that
5425,"well , this has been a good conversation . have a great evening wherever you are !"
5426,"hi , how are you ?"
5427,hi . good how are you . do you watch nfl ?
5428,i do watch the nfl . do you ?
5429,yes me too . did you know women can play too ?
5430,"wow , weird . do you think they should play ?"
5431,"yes , why not . if they can make the cut they should play"
5432,i agree . i am not sure i could watch it though . those players are huge .
5433,true . did you hear about that cheerleader rule in new orleans ?
5434,i did not . what is it ?
5435,they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players
5436,that's sexist . what if they are there first ? the nfl has only 11 minutes of action .
5437,"i find that sexist too . and if they are eating and the player walks in , they have to leave . weird ."
5438,"if i were them , i would dump my meal on the floor and make a scene . . ."
5439,yeah i guess they like to oblige to those rules . did you know nfl players make less than engineers ?
5440,i did not . that makes sense though since most nfl players only last 23 yeras .
5441,yeah i guess . did you know espn won an emmy ?
5442,"no , for what ?"
5443,the creation of the superimposed yellow line
5444,wow . . . is that emmy worthy ? i feel like that's a low bar to get an emmy . . .
5445,i do not get it either . do you know benjarvus greenellis ?
5446,"yes , football player who never fumbled . nice chatting with you !"
5447,good evening ! are you ready for the super bowl in a week ?
5448,"not really so bogged down with work i haven't been able to keep up . but who's not ready for a single elimination tournament , right ?"
5449,"it's certainly different than most sports ! it's crazy to think that brady is going to another one , but back in high school he was the 2nd string on a jv team where his coach wouldn't play him !"
5450,"strange i wonder why that was , did he dislike him ? know he's big time !"
5451,"who knows , but even most nfl teams passed on him with the patriots getting him in the sixth , of seven , round of the nfl draft ."
5452,and know he's a 4 time superbowl champion .
5453,he is getting older . i wonder what young quarterback will be the next one to have success . baker mayfield maybe ?
5454,is ; nt he from the university of oklahoma ? i hear he once considered a career playing halo
5455,yes he is . can you imagine ? i wonder how close he was to becoming a professional gamer . i bet he challenges everyone around if there is a gaming system nearby .
5456,"i would , ha ha ! hard to believe in the entire nfl there is only one left handed quarterback ."
5457,"i can remember some from the past , so i wonder where all the lefthanded quarterbacks are now ? do you happen to know who it is ?"
5458,"i always hated playing with a lefty , the ball spun the wrong way . i believe his name is kellan moore ."
5459,interesting ! do you follow nfl throughout the year at all ?
5460,don't get a chance i'm hoping to watch the sb this year . there is only 11 minutes of live football gameplay so i should be able to catch something .
5461,"for as long as the game takes , it's amazing that there is only that much action . they almost don't need to spend all that money using tracking chips that record everything the player does ."
5462,tell me about it ! did you know that there is no written rule that females can't play in the sport .
5463,"i knew some women played in college , but since none had played yet , i wasn't sure . speaking of women in football , i heard that the new orleans cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if new orleans players enter it ."
5464,yeah that's probably to do with the strictness of the dating policy . i don't have anything against them playing .
5465,that would be rough ! if it happens maybe they will have locker rooms decorated in pink like iowa's visiting locker room is .
5466,that was some type of physiological mind games he was doing .
5467,"absolutely . i am in a neighboring state that considers iowa a rival , so they definitely want to gain any edge they can ."
5468,i don't blame him . what about top bowlers in the 60's making twice as much as nfl players .
5469,"that is crazy ! great chat , but i need to run ."
5470,hi . do you like football ?
5471,"hi , how are you ? yes i like football . i do not know it well ."
5472,i do not know much about football but i definitely know the position the quarterback . i know they call the play and they have to touch the ball on every offensive play and they are the player that usually throws the ball .
5473,"the qb is the man , right ? the guy that everyone looks to save the team ? i would not want that job . it sounds stressful ."
5474,it sure does . there was a high school that had a really bad season and they failed to win any games or score any points and never used their backup quarterback . the backup was tom brady
5475,that must have been before he could prove his worth . the coach should have tried him for at least one play though . maybe he played his favorites .
5476,i think it is hard to see true talent in high school . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he started college as a junior and go his bachelors degree in two years and started his masters before being first pick in the nfl draft .
5477,"he was a smart ambitious guy . talent knows no bounds . he probably could be a doctor , a lawyer , an engineer ."
5478,you're right . he probably could have become anything he wanted to . baker mayfield was a quarterback that considered quitting to pursue full time competitive gaming . his talents were a little different than others .
5479,"i would do football . more money and fame . more injuries and concussions too , but then again , no guts , no glory ."
5480,what is interesting is that the lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average nfl player .
5481,engineers have special skills that are in demand . i would rather be an engineer because no concussions . women would do better as engineers
5482,the nfl has no rules against female players . they just need to meet the league's requirements .
5483,"i would rather women went into something useful for society . sports are good but we need engineers . anyway , thats just my opinion ."
5484,well it seems like we are a long way because new orleans saint cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a football player is there
5485,i dont understand these outdated misogynistic rules . i think that they are all adults and can deal with their business .
5486,i agree it's just silly . like iowa paints the visiting football teams locker room completely pink . is that really necessary ?
5487,"i guess they want to psych out the other team . probably doesnt work or everyone would do it , yeah ? then it wouldnt work at all ."
5488,it would work on cumberland who lost to georgia tech 222 to 0 .
5489,"if cumberland painted the visitors room pink , would it have helped ? i wonder what the gt coach was trying to prove ."
5490,well thanks so much for chatting . i learned a lot of new and interesting things about football .
5491,do you watch football ?
5492,i do . i didn't realize that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl .
5493,"i'm not a big follower , but that is very interesting ! why is the quarterback is usually considered the leader of the offensive team ?"
5494,because he calls the plays and usually touches the ball on every offensive play . there is a quarterback named russell wilson who actually has a major league baseball contract in addition to his nfl contract . i didn't know that was possible .
5495,he sounds like a go getter ! wow . i was reading about the circular huddle that is used in football . i had no idea it was created by a deaf football player named paul hubbard .
5496,"that is interesting , but makes sense , so other teams couldn't see his plays . the highest paid us department of defense employees are the football coaches of the service branch teams !"
5497,that is so neat ! women can play in the nfl too . i had no idea !
5498,awesome ! brad johnson once threw a touchdown pass to himself ! that would have been interesting to watch !
5499,that would ! i wonder how that worked ? i always wondered how much time was actually played in football . says the average is only 11 minutes live gameplay .
5500,wow . not much at all . i wonder who will be in the superbowl the first sunday in february ?
5501,will you watch all 17 weeks to the end ?
5502,"i don't watch consistently , just once in a while . i didn't know the first playoff game was in 1932 ."
5503,"isn't that crazy ? so it this . . new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave ."
5504,that's ridiculous and so old fashioned ! i didn't know the nfl uses tracking devices in players shoulder pads and in the footballs themselves to record everything that happens during a game .
5505,me either ! do you follow the colts ? do you think they will do well this season ?
5506,i don't follow them . i wonder if they will be one of the six teams from their conference to get into the playoffs .
5507,from the article it seems they really want the colts to get in the playoffs .
5508,"i didn't know there were two wild card teams from each division that get in , i though it was just one from each ."
5509,"this is funny though . . baker mayfield , quarterback , university of oklahoma , once considered quitting football to pursue fulltime competitive gaming , and claims to be able to beat anyone at the university of oklahoma oneonone in halo 3 ."
5510,quite a claim to fame . college football is huge . 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams !
5511,very cool ! merry christmas !
5512,same to you !
5513,do you like football ?
5514,"yes , i like football . i especially like going to see the live games . i just heard about sean mcvay becoming a top nfl coach of the year candidate in year 1 with the rams . pretty snazzy ."
5515,do you like any position or player in particular ?
5516,"i like new england patriots qb , tom brady . he's great . i just learned that the quarterback touches the football on almost every single offensive play and is the offensive player that almost always throws forward passes ."
5517,i agree . the patriots are like the lannisters of football
5518,"yes , absolutely . did you know that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?"
5519,yes so it shows how essential qb are in the offensive plays in that short time frame
5520,"true . did you know that the junipero serra high school jv football team recorded a historically bad season in which they failed to win a game or even score a touchdown yet they never attempted to start their backup quarterback ? that backup quarterback they refused to start is 4 time super bowl champion , tom brady ."
5521,perhaps they just didn't want to leave a stain on brady's record at that point ?
5522,"never thought of the pointofview , huh . that could very well be . speaking of quarterbacks , did you know who started the circular huddle ?"
5523,wasn't it by a deaf qb to hide his hand signals ?
5524,"yes , and his name was paul hubbard ."
5525,another qb i follow is kellan moore since he is a lefty
5526,"yes , apparently moore is the only lefty quarterback in the nfl at this time ."
5527,"ya and unlike other sports , being a lefty qb has more cons than pro"
5528,"wow , didn't realize that . speaking of hands , did you know that former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career ? wow ."
5529,that is indeed impressive and one of the reasons i like the patriots . a lot of amazing talent .
5530,"another lesser known fact about football is the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 to 0 . wow , unbelievable ."
5531,"man i wonder if the winners were just that good , the loser just that bad , or a combination of both"
5532,"sounds pretty bad for the cumberland guys . another fact is that back in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars , wow ."
5533,"well times sure have changed . i mean who even watches bowlers anymore . in any case , thanks for chatting"
5534,"hello there , do you follow the nfl at all ?"
5535,yes . did you know they track players with tracking chips that are in their shoulder pads ?
5536,i think i have heard about that before . the game is getting more high tech each year i will say .
5537,it's amazing that there aren't any women playing in the nfl even though they are allowed to join .
5538,i think it would be really cool if a female player did make it and we got to see them on tv .
5539,maybe it's not all that cut out to be . engineers on average earn more than nfl players .
5540,"i think i have heard that before , i think it is mainly due to the careers not being as long as an engineers ."
5541,yeah . career paths can change unexpectedly for people . baker mayfield considered being a competitive gamer .
5542,"yeah baker was really good at halo 3 if i'm correct , did you ever play halo ?"
5543,"no i have not . also , alex smith had his bachelors degree before he was picked in the nfl draft . we are not confined to one trade or craft ."
5544,"alex smith was really bright , i think he could have gone into any different field he wanted ."
5545,"yeah , everything is possible . i hope though that new orleans saints cheerleaders get better treatment ."
5546,that rule about them being the restaurant and having to leave is so outdated .
5547,it is amazing that nfl games usually have 11 minutes of actual live game play . that fact somehow alluded me .
5548,"that is just crazy , i don't think most people would ever guess it was that little ."
5549,"decades ago , it may have been a better option to be a bowler than a football player ."
5550,"yeah i would have loved to have been a pro bowler back then , on par with what the footballs guys were making !"
5551,times were probably so different back then !
5552,oh yeah and it goes to show just how much the nfl has grown since then .
5553,i hope the changes to come will be changes that promote more diversity and equal treatment . use of tracking chips are a good step towards increasing safety .
5554,"yeah i hope the same . i think the tracking chips will help with safety as well . well it's been nice talking with you , i hope you have a good night ."
5555,are you a fan of the nfl ?
5556,"a little bit . i do enjoy watching some playoff games and the super bowl , but i don't follow any team closely . what about you ?"
5557,i follow the redskins .
5558,i'm sorry for you then hehe ! who's the current qb of your team ?
5559,i don't know to be honest . we've won a few super bowls in my time . i can't complain .
5560,"did you know that tom brady was a backup qb in high school . his team lost all games , but his coach refused to put him on field ?"
5561,"yeah , i knew that . he doesn't get injured much . i think that is why he is so good ."
5562,he's won yet again this year . and it looks like he has no plan to retire soon . he will be known as the greatest of all time when all is said and done
5563,that is probably true . i wonder what he will do after football ?
5564,he doesn't have to do anything . he already has all the money in the world . maybe coaching ? nfl season's are only 17 weeks long . . .
5565,i'm not sure he'd be a good coach . maybe he will just be like elway ?
5566,what does elway do now ?
5567,i think he is the owner of the broncos .
5568,that's a possibility . i'm not sure that robert kraft will sell his team though . there's only 32 teams in the league and they're worth quite a bit right now .
5569,robert kraft is in a bunch of trouble right now .
5570,"i don't think it matters too much . football , the american kind , is such a big business that he will be get a tiny slap on the wrist and get sent home"
5571,"yeah , that is true . i didn't know that espn won an emmy for that first down marker , pretty cool if you ask me ."
5572,i didn't either . i don't think i could watch a football game ever again without these . they help so much in following the action
5573,"that they are . i couldn't imagine a game without it . well , nice chatting !"
5574,same here . have a great day
5575,you too !
5576,hello ?
5577,hi . do you watch football ?
5578,"i do , it is one of my favorites ."
5579,same here . did you know the first nfl playoff game was in 1932 ?
5580,"no , serious ?"
5581,apparently it was played on an 80 yard field in chicago .
5582,"awesome , was it snowing ?"
5583,"hopefully not , because they played on a dirt field , so that would get really muddy ."
5584,who is your favorite quaterback ?
5585,i liked nick foles last year ! did you know russell wilson also has a contract as a professional baseball player ?
5586,"no , i didn't know that . i would do that instead ."
5587,"well , he hasn't played since 2011 , so he must be better at football ."
5588,did you know the huddle was made in order to hide hand signals ?
5589,really ? do you know who made it ?
5590,it was paul hubbard .
5591,very cool . there is a high school stadium in texas that cost 60 million to make ! i would be interested to see what makes it so expensive .
5592,wholly molly ! are you serious ?
5593,"yeah . it's in allen , texas and has 18 , 000 seats !"
5594,interesting . everything is big in texas !
5595,very true ! like those big american flags that they use at football games which weigh 1100 pounds !
5596,"omg , are you serious ? that can't be true"
5597,"and apparently they cost 50 , 000 ? ! who knew ! thanks for chatting . have a nice weekend !"
5598,hello there . are you an nfl fan ? i wanted to become an nfl player once but it looks like it's more financially smart to become an engineer .
5599,i love the nfl . interesting that engineers make more than football stars over the course of their lifetime .
5600,yes it is . i am still waiting for the first female football player . the nfl has no written rule against female players .
5601,i bet it will be a kicker position . what do you think ?
5602,yeah i agree i don't think another position would be suiting . there are so many injuries even though live gameplay only lasts 11 minutes .
5603,hard to believe that stat . greenellis never fumbled the football his entire nfl career .
5604,yeah that is very impressive . i wonder if the nfl tracked him when he played by using a chip in the shoulder pad ?
5605,"i read they use the chips to track ball speed , rotation , velocity , and location ."
5606,yeah i wonder what they do with that information ? maybe they use it to help improve the quarterback position ? i bet kellen moore has some interesting football tracking stats because he is the only lefthanded quarterback .
5607,i'm not too sure what they do with the information . i didn't realize that about kellan moore .
5608,yeah kind of interesting . another interesting fact is the circle huddle used in today's football was created by a deaf quarterback so the other team could not read his hand signals .
5609,that is interesting !
5610,yes it is . baker mayfield want to consider quitting football to pursue fulltime competitive gaming . that would've been quite the career change .
5611,i heard he liked halo 3 .
5612,yet sounds like you could be anyone at the university of oklahoma in a one on one game . of halo three that is .
5613,do you like alex smith ?
5614,yeah he seems so smart . taking all those ap classes must have been challenging .
5615,i agree . hard to believe he was a junior when he started college .
5616,yeah and becoming the first overall pick in 2005 is also no easy feat . it was great talking with you today .
5617,i agree . who's your favorite qb ?
5618,my favorite qb is russel wilson ! he is a great guy . thanks again for the conversation and have a good day !
5619,"hey , tom brady is 41 . how about that ? are you ready to play in the nfl ."
5620,not at this point . i think i'll stick to engineering . better career longevity . but good for tom ! he's in the sb again . getting a bit repetitive .
5621,wow . engineering . care to guess the highest ever scoring football game ? it was in 1916 .
5622,"i would guess that some powerhouse school played a puny academic institution . i wonder what the spread on the game was , and if the bookies took any bets ."
5623,i do not know what the betting was like . georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 . i would have been bored watching that .
5624,i wonder whether georgia tech put in their second and third string . the person scheduling that game must have been sacked . i'm surprised a cumberland player didn't get killed !
5625,"1916 was a long time ago . today , there are 32 teams in the nfl and a game has only 11 minutes of live game play . thats a lot of commercials , timeouts and flag waving ."
5626,"the game really is slow . it's punctuated with a lot of violent action , but it doesn't have the flow of basketball ."
5627,yes . i agree . i know that the life time earnings of an engineer is greater than the lifetime earnings of a nfl player . i assume the violence makes for shorter earnings potential .
5628,"i figure the concussions alone preclude a career as an engineer after the nfl . i am surprised that there is only one lefthanded qb in the nfl . i guess i expected more , since each team has three qbs or so ."
5629,only one left handed qb . that is a fascinating bit of trivia . another fascinating bit of trivia is . . no rule against female players . think how wild the game would be .
5630,i think female players could certainly handle noncontact positions such as kicker or punter . i don't know whether they could take the serious contact of the line of scrimmage .
5631,art and grace in running with a ball has a place . or something like that . tom brady is playing the first sunday in february . the super bowl is on . who is the left handed qb ?
5632,"kellan moore is the only leftie out there . brad johnson has an interesting claim to fame : he is a qb , but he threw a td to himself . i didn't know that was legal , but i guess the passer and receiver can be the same player ."
5633,that is an interesting thing . i guess as a kid we all threw the ball in the air on a high arc to step forward and catch it again . guess what color the u of iowa painted the visiting team locker room ?
5634,either something really sinister or something feminine .
5635,"in it entirely painted pink . i wonder if it makes a difference . it is funny how many different games are kind of not football but called foot ball around the world . soccer , rugby and more ."
5636,"i guess they could have painted it black , just like the rolling stones said . might have put the opposition in a dire mood . football is such a generic term . could mean almost anything ."
5637,"i am sure kids have fun with a ball no mater what . australian rules foot ball must be different than rugby . i have never seen gaelic football , but i bet its a tough game ."
5638,violence is the key . i think the presence of the ball is incidental . just there as an excuse to pummel the other team . texas seems to be obsessed with high school football .
5639,violence or a high speed chess game ?
5640,do you like football ?
5641,"hi ! i love football and the nfl , even though i hate the 17 week regular season that lasts from the beginning of september all the way to late december . i wish it was longer . what about you ?"
5642,"i love it , 32 teams 2 divisions and then after a long wait the superbowl"
5643,and it is a long wait . ha ! it's bad enough the average game is only 11 minutes long in terms of live gameplay . then we have to wait a long time for the season to start again after the super bowl ends .
5644,"all season only to watch 11 minutes of live gameplay , seems really unfair , do you have a favorite nfl team ?"
5645,"i really like them all , honestly , although i don't like that silly misogynistic rule the saints have in place that forbids cheerleaders from dining in the same restaurant as the football players . i can't believe no lawsuits have been filed over that rule yet !"
5646,"i know right , its a terrible rule and should be abolished so unfair and also so sexist"
5647,there have not been any female players drafted yet .
5648,yeah maybe the interested ones didn't met the eligibility requirement but it would be great to watch a woman play some day
5649,"indeed it would . but honestly , if they do it simply for the money , they should just enter the engineering field since engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players anyway ."
5650,looks like engineers have it great they make more money and they don't risk the injuries football players do .
5651,so true . you know what's sad is even the top bowlers made more than the top football players back in the 1960s . and football is a much tougher sport . i feel for the players from that era .
5652,they did ? i guess football wasn't a popular game back then i don't think bowlers make much money these days
5653,it's sad especially when you have athletes like benjarvus greenellis who's never fumbled the football in his entire pro career ! they definitely deserve top pay !
5654,sad how many players still end up with financial problems or even bankrupt and then also with brain damage or a serious injury
5655,"i know , it is sad ! but you know , they're sticking these tracking chips in the players' shoulder pads now to record their every move so hopefully they can use it to study how to prevent serious injuries !"
5656,"i think that's great , we must protect our players and make the game safer that must be like our 1 priority"
5657,"that is so true . well since we're on the subject , are you a fan of qbs ? i like kellan moore because he's the only left handed qb in the nfl , which is surprising ."
5658,its my favorite position in football and i think his retired by now haven't heard his name in a while
5659,yeah it's my favorite position as well because he touches the ball on nearly every single offensive play and he's the leader of the offense ! it's such a fascinating position !
5660,"i know right , calling the play in the huddle must be really exiting , being the decisive player on the team , but anyways its been great chatting with you"
5661,"i bet it is tough . that's why you need geniuses to play the position like alex smith who entered college as a junior . he even received his bachelor's in two years . that's fascinating ! well it was great chatting with you as well ! i hope you have a great evening , friend !"
5662,"he is a role model to many , proof that you can do both if you set your mind to it , hope you have a great night , thanks for all the cool facts and the conversation"
5663,hello
5664,good morning . i hope you're doing well this fine monday morning . do you like nfl football ?
5665,i love it . you
5666,i do too . my favorite team is the new england patriots . how about you ?
5667,i like the steelers .
5668,"you a big ben fan , then . cool , i like pittsburgh ."
5669,did you know that top bowlers made more than nfl stars in the 60s ?
5670,"that's hard to believe , isn't it . but then again the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is more than the lifetime earnings of your average nfl player ."
5671,i should say the average nfl player has a pretty awesome job though .
5672,"true , but they do get banged up pretty hard sometimes , too . so , i guess it's a tradeoff ."
5673,i guess . i think i would rather be in the nfl myself though .
5674,"that's cool , what position would you play , quarterback ?"
5675,or rb . i want the ball . hopefully i could go a whole career without fumbling . like benjarvis green ellis .
5676,"yeah , that must have been tremendous pressure on him to never have fumbled the ball his whole career . i sure wouldn't have been able to do it . lol"
5677,me either . wonder how many years he played .
5678,"i'm not sure , but it's still an impressive feat ! did you watch the last superbowl ?"
5679,yeah i watched most of it . i just wanted the patriots to lose to be honest .
5680,"oh , no . you pulled against my team ? shame on you ! lol . i tell you i was wore out from watching it , though . seemed like it lasted 3 hours ."
5681,i think it did . lol .
5682,"that's depressing and a lot of wasted time , considering the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual live game play !"
5683,im with you there they should speed the game up a little . have a good one .
5684,hi there . i wasn't aare that new orleans saint cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player .
5685,the national football league and its teams have a lot of rules !
5686,many variations of football too .
5687,"true , and american football is much less popular globally than soccer ."
5688,i actually like soccer better . maybe because i have played that as a female . although that can get brutal too i guess .
5689,there is actually no rule against female players in the nfl .
5690,no . iowa's locker room for visiting reams is pink lol
5691,"i doubt that color was chosen due to gender ! maybe for the better , since an average engineer earns more than an average pro athelete ."
5692,i was surprised to see that top blowers in the 60's were paid more than football stars .
5693,"things certainly have changed . still , quarterbacks have always made money ."
5694,maybe because they are considered the ' leader ' of the offensive team ?
5695,"perhaps so . when a deaf quarterback played , the team created the modern circular huddle ."
5696,interesting . and espn created that yellow line for the first down . added amenities for football .
5697,the players are also interesting . alex smith was smart enough to enter college as a junior !
5698,wonder if he was going to be an engineer ?
5699,i think he was always planning on playing football . baker mayfield on the other hand considered fulltime competitive gaming .
5700,"he's quite confident too , claiming to be able to beat anyone oneonone in halo 3 . at oklahoma that is ."
5701,"good thing he is not lefthanded , as kellan moore is the only lefty qb in the nfl ."
5702,it seems like they are always playing bt there are only 16 games per season .
5703,"true , but that is over 17 weeks . add in four playoff rounds and four preseason , that is nearly half the year !"
5704,nice chatting with you . has been informative .
5705,no problem . remember that even tom brady could not get in a game while in jv football !
5706,"hi , how are you ?"
5707,good how are you ?
5708,"i am well , do you like the nfl at all ?"
5709,yes i love it play off time
5710,apparently women are technically allowed to play in the nfl !
5711,i did not know that but it would be interesting if she could take a couple hits
5712,"yeah , she might be okay , the average nfl game has 11 minutes of game time !"
5713,wow i would think that number would be way higher .
5714,"yeah , but we need more commercials !"
5715,hell no we dont lol . they need to limit that or make the game longer so we see action not replays
5716,"i agree , there are some odd aspects . cheerleaders for the saints cant even eat where the players go to eat !"
5717,i guess it's to prevent fraternizing .
5718,"i guess so , but still , seems like an odd rule . apparently engineers make more than football players !"
5719,thats not fair all
5720,"i don't think so either , they are actually underpaid considering what teams make !"
5721,yes that is how this life works
5722,"i suppose so , poor guys take a beating in all senses , like imagine cody parkey right now"
5723,i know right not fair at all
5724,"nope , but they don't make the rules"
5725,"i hear that . the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink , what you think about that"
5726,that is hilarious . it must make them feel silly i bet .
5727,"i know kill the spirit . did you know baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue fulltime competitive gaming , and claims to be able to beat anyone at the university of oklahoma oneonone in halo 3 ."
5728,"that is crazy , i bet the browns are glad he did not !"
5729,"i am a big fan of the national football league , even if my favorite team , the redskins , are often one of the worst of the 32 teams"
5730,"i love the nfl , my team are the vikings !"
5731,it is curious how the games last several hours when there is only an average of 11 minutes of actual game play during the event
5732,"for sure , if only they could speed up the commericals , it would make it a better watch . did you know woman could play in the nfl"
5733,i do though none ever have ! i wanted to be a wide receiver when i was a kid but alas it was not to be .
5734,for sure me too lol ! are you an alex smith fan then ?
5735,i am he is definitely a smart guy working on his masters when he was drafted
5736,for sure and getting a degree his sophomore year of college then becoming the 1 pick . he has done it all i guess
5737,yes . he is good but not as good as tom brady he has won 4 super bowls !
5738,"i think tom brady has won 6 , he is really good !"
5739,yes but his high school coach did not think so he was never even allowed to play !
5740,"i know and he was draft in the 6th round of the draft , not too many people had high hopes for the guy"
5741,yes but he is amazing . did you know that there is only one left handed qb in the nfl ? that surprises me
5742,i think it is kellen moore . vick is my favorite lefty of all time !
5743,yes there was even a deaf quarterback once did you know that ? i guess the crowds would be less distracting
5744,"i didn't know that , i wonder if he had anything to do with the huddles ?"
5745,yes they were invented to hide his hand signals from the other team
5746,"that is smart , and look it still exists ! do you know benjarvus green ellis ?"
5747,does he play for the patriots ?
5748,yep and played for the bengals . he never fumbled once in his whole career . that is amazing !
5749,that is crazy amazing ! he must not have ever played for cumberland they once lost to gt 2220 !
5750,i would have quit ! good chatting with you !
5751,i don't thik the jets every landed kirk cousins since he is in minnesota now . the jets had a horrible year .
5752,maybe landing kirk cousins would have helped them ?
5753,i think so . darnold is not the answer in ny in my opinion .
5754,some seem curious as to why the jets did not want to fork over the money for a sure thing since they had the funds .
5755,agree . especially seeing how much garoppolo got for only 7 nfl starts . seems the browns have made more progress in getting a good qb in the draft .
5756,minnesota was predicted to be themost appealing destination for cousins .
5757,yeah he went there and had an average year . they missed the playoffs .
5758,cousins implied that he wasn't necessarily going for the money but he was going for the best situation .
5759,i believe that . the jets are a bad situation . he probably could have gotten 150m guaranteed which is unheard of . this according to mike florio from pro football talk .
5760,cbs sport's jason la canfora thought the jets and broncos would be finalists in getting cousins as he thought new york would bemore appealing to the quarterback .
5761,"yeah , i'm glad the redskins did not place the franchise tag on cousins again . that would have been bad for everyone involved ."
5762,i see . what is a franchise tag ?
5763,franchise tag is when the player get the average of the top 3 salaries at your position in the league . guaranteed money but only for one year . players usually do not like it because it is not a long term deal and they could get hurt .
5764,"oh , interesting . thanks for the explanation . i wonder why there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?"
5765,thats interesting . never thought about that . kelen moore but not sure who he plays for .
5766,i don't know too much about football so i appreciate your comments . the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . maybe that's why i'm not too into it .
5767,it is crazy to think of it like that for such a fast sport .
5768,i find it interesting how much technology there is in football these days .
5769,i know tracking chips in helmets and pads to record moves . probably to protect them better in the future .
5770,"yeah , that's what i was thinking of . i also find it interesing that espn won an emmy for that superimposed yellow line ."
5771,i hope they just use that line to measure first downs instead of those stupid chains !
5772,"yes , i believe it's a first down line ."
5773,"hello . are you aware that the new orleans saints cheerleaders must leave a restaurant , if a player walks in ? even if they aren't done eating ? how archaic is that ?"
5774,"as someone from louisiana and a saints fan , i am a bit surprised at having such a arcane rule . to me , if the cheerleaders were there first , then they should be allowed to finish the meal they paid for . but football does have its oddities , like the university of iowa painting the visitors locker room pink !"
5775,"that's easier to deal with , though i do wonder if the saints would give a female an opportunity to start if she met the eligibility requirements ."
5776,"well , we just broke the glass ceiling on refs with a female ref officiating in an nfl playoff game . so maybe a female player might not be too far off if they meet the requirements . perhaps a punter or kicker , i . e . a lower physical impact position , first ."
5777,"maybe . living in brown's country , i'm so glad baker mayfield didn't give up football to become a professional gamer ."
5778,cleveland is a team my heart goes out too . for the longest time the saints did not have a super bowl . now its cleveland's turn to make it to the top . what do you think of tech in football ? it seems like they have tracking chips in shoulder pads and balls ?
5779,"i don't really know how i feel about that . i guess it's okay , if it keeps them safe . i wonder if they would be willing to share the technology with car manufacturers ?"
5780,"maybe , but since a car moves more than 100 yards , it will need to be at a different scale . i read somewhere that kellan moore is the only lefthanded quarterback in the nfl . i know lefthanders have certain advantages in baseball , e . g . first baseman , but do you think it is an advantage as a quarterback ?"
5781,"i don't know , i don't follow football very closely . i know the games are too long on t . v . , since there is only 11 minutes of live play ."
5782,i agree ; too many commercials and too much armchair quarterbacking from the broadcast booth . an innovation i liked was when espn created the yellow line overlay so that tv viewers can comprehend how long a drive is needed to get a first down . did you know that espn won an emmy for the superimposed 1st down yellow line ?
5783,"yes , that must have been a slow year . i find it impressive that alex smith entered college as a junior , due to taking so many ap classes . wish my kids were that dedicated ."
5784,"he has to be one of the few that completed their education . so many enter the nfl draft before graduating college . that , in part might explain the lifetime earnings of an engineer exceed the lifetime earnings of an average nfl player ."
5785,"i don't know . i know a lot of them continue their education in the off season . i know bowlers in the 60's made more than football players , that's weird too"
5786,"that is a bit beyond comprehension . in my opinion , watch in bowling on tv is a bit like watching paint dry ! i recently found out that many years ago , the nfl had a deaf quarterback . he created the circular huddle so the opposing team could not steal his play signs !"
5787,that's fascinating . there is a former running back for the patriots who has never fumbled . that's an amazing feat .
5788,i agree . have you been following the bronco's quarterback situation since the retirement of peyton manning ?
5789,"i have not . i barely pay attention to football , only when my son has it on . i only know about baker mayfield's competitiveness on halo 3 , because of him ."
5790,i don't follow it much either . but it seems that the bronco have struggled putting together an offence . they picked case keenum who is a bit of a unknown quantity ; it seems he has been traded a lot of times .
5791,is elway the one they call the ' football czar ' ?
5792,"yes , and he's denvers gm . so , he trying to get a good mix so they can get back to the super bowl . the question is this a short term trial run with keenum or a longer game plan ? it seems like keenum has a short contract so he might be a placeholder until elway finds the one he wants ."
5793,"thank you for chatting with me , have a lovely day ."
5794,you to . we have our 1st mardi gras parade tonight . hopefully the rain will hold off !
5795,"hey there who is your favorite quarterback ? i know that i like tom brady , even though he's never eaten a strawberry lol"
5796,"personally , i like eli manning the best . i do find it odd that brady has never tried a strawberry lol"
5797,i know right ! i always wonder why he hasn't tried on before lol . i like eli manning too . what do you think about alex smith ?
5798,he's seems very educated . i heard he took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a junior . smart guy
5799,"it sounds like he's a smart guy yes . and he passed his bachelor's degree in only about 2 years , and was working on his master's before he got into the nfl , definitely a genius"
5800,"i agree , it's good to be educated . i wanted to be an nfl player but decided to stick to engineering . the average engineer makes more than most nfl players"
5801,"that's interesting . and yes i've heard that before . i guess if you are an nfl player , you have to be smart with your money so that you'd lasts over your lifetime . what do you think about the circular huddle ? did you ever do that when you were playing"
5802,"yes i did do that a few times . fun fact , it was actually created by a deaf quarterback !"
5803,"that is really cool , and i'm sure that he used it so that other people couldn't see his hand signs . i wonder how good he was at football , i don't think we've had a deaf quarterback in the nfl , do you know ?"
5804,"i'm actually not sure . but i do know that kellan moore the only left handed quarterback in the nfl . seems odd , you'd think lefties would be more common"
5805,"you would think so yes . i wonder if it gives him an advantage or not , do you know ? i also think it's interesting that one player almost became a professional video game player , imagine that is such a difference lol"
5806,that is quite the difference lol ! i think you're talking about baker mayfield . . apparently he can beat anyone at halo 3
5807,yep that's who i was referring to . i used to play halo 3 back in the day . did you ever play any of the halo games ? i wish i could have played him lol
5808,i did play halo but i wasn't very good at it . he could definitely beat me oneonone ! lol
5809,haha yes i bet he could beat us both actually . do you watch bowling at all ? apparently top bowlers in the 60s made more than top football players back in that day
5810,"wow ! makes sense because bowling was a lot more popular back then . also technology has come so far , the nfl uses tracking chips now to record a player's every move"
5811,"wow that's interesting . how did those work by the way ? i wonder if anyone ever put tracking chips in bowling balls lol ,"
5812,"they embed them in the shoulder pads and it basically tracks velocity , ball speed , location , etc . it's pretty cool . tracking chips in bowling balls would be interesting lol"
5813,"lol i agree with you . you ever watch football on tv by the way ? did you know that espn won an emmy ? it was for developing that yellow line that you see on tv , you know the one that designates the first down"
5814,"i did hear that , that's pretty neat that that they could superimpose something like that"
5815,"yes i bet that was very advanced technology back in the day haha . i also like that the patriots have a player that has never fumbled the ball before . that is an insane record to me , i would hand that guy the ball all the time"
5816,so i love the fact that women can be possibly eligible for the nfl
5817,yes . . . very much .
5818,what do you think about them chipping the players moves ?
5819,"discover the nine best chipping tips , that will make you chipping motion dead solid ."
5820,"i don't know what that means , however it is a good thing statiscally"
5821,yes . . . this good for us .
5822,"i love the fact about tom brady not being used as a back up qb and how he turned out . . i don't know much about football , so that is a great fun fact , what is your favorite thing about football ?"
5823,"i'll be honest , my favorite thing about football is a nasty , soul jarring , hit . . . . i love that in football you can always point at a couple teams"
5824,"oh fun , that is much more exciting than the dances they do in the endzone !"
5825,very much exciting
5826,"im glad i dont watch it though . . with that statistic of only 11 min of live play , what are people watching then ?"
5827,"on average , american adults are watching five hours and four minutes of television per day . the bulk of that is about four and a half hours of it is live television , which is television watched when originally broadcast ."
5828,do you watch the super bowl for the game or the commercials ?
5829,yes .
5830,lol . . i don't even know who is good . who do you think is going to the superbowl ?
5831,"super bowl liii , the 53rd super bowl and the 49th modernera national football league , nfl , championship game , will decide the league champion for the 2018 nfl season . the game is scheduled to be played on february 3 , 2019 , at mercedesbenz stadium in atlanta , georgia ."
5832,ok . . that didn't answer my question . do you like other types of football ? i think rugby is super fun to watch !
5833,no . soccer
5834,well that is considered football in other countries . . do you have a favorite player ?
5835,neymar
5836,thank you
5837,"hi , how are you or"
5838,well thanks . what do you think of pat mahomes ?
5839,i think he's great ! he just won the mvp and it's only his first year starting and second overall . he's got a bright future . . .
5840,the youngest player to throw 6 tds in a game . thats pretty good
5841,yeah . he is a really good athlete . his team asked him to stop playing basketball because he was too good and may hurt himself . . .
5842,thats really understandable but he's young guy . what do you expect him to do ?
5843,"especially when a lot of young guys end up in bars and clubs drunk and then in bad situations . i think he's a good dude , by all accounts ."
5844,i heard last year he didnt do any endorsements to stay out of the spotlight because he was still the backup
5845,"i think a lot of young guys do that coming into the league . andrew luck did that too . it was interesting to see him , the number 1 pick , and the 2nd pick and how they went about their careers ."
5846,it helps that the chiefs have very talented players on offense . its really hard to cover all of them
5847,yeah . their weapons are really talented . they had to cut their running back due to assualting a woman . not ok !
5848,im glad the chiefs did something . most teams would've tried to sweep it under the rug
5849,"once the video gets out there , they have to respond . the ravens and nfl failed on the ray rice domestic violence issue so now everyone has to respond by cutting the player when the video gets out ."
5850,the nfl doesnt have a rule against female players . how hard do you think it would be for them
5851,"i do not think the american public has the stomach to see a small female compete with huge dudes . although there might not be a rule , it would not be a good look ."
5852,yeah as talented as you may be . it would be really hard when the other person can weigh 3x as much as you
5853,the physicality of the game is crazy . the average person wouldn't be able to compete .
5854,it would look like when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 . which is the highest score ever . no one needs to see that
5855,ha ! yes . like that ! good reference and transition ! espn won an emmy for that yellow line ?
5856,it is crazy to think how much that line has changed football viewing .
5857,nice chatting with you !
5858,"hi , how are you today ?"
5859,"im great , do you like foorball ? do you follow the nfl ?"
5860,sometimes . there is no rule against women playing . i wonder if women will ever appear in the league .
5861,"i dont think so , though i think it's interesting that there's no written rule"
5862,"women would be good at engineering . they could make more money , and not have to deal with so many concussions . the brain is the center of intelligence , even in nfl players ."
5863,"i agree brain damage is a real danger for players , it can really play a number on them and i guess an engineer does make more money in his life time and with less risks"
5864,plus engineers are important to the game . the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field .
5865,"and theres also chips on the footballs , they are used to track velocity of the ball , the rotation , spin and also the location"
5866,"better for women to be engineers than nfl cheerleaders , that's for sure ."
5867,"i agree , theres an unfair rule against cheerleaders ."
5868,"yes , that's true . do you follow the college game ? the highest score in a football game took place in 1916 when the mighty georgia tech defeated lowly cumberland 2220 ."
5869,"one thing is for sure they couldnt perform worse than a team that is losing by 222 points , thats an epic loss , humiliating for sure"
5870,i would love to know the spread on that game . in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . i guess that pro football leagues were not well developed then .
5871,"yeah it seems that way since football players earn a ton of money now , do you have a favorite team ?"
5872,"no , don't really have a favorite . some teams i dislike though . the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink . i guess they think they're going to psych out the other team . have they won more games at home because of that locker room ? do other teams do the same thing ?"
5873,"i dont think so , its the first time i hear about a football team having pink locker rooms , football seems like a scam though , only 11 minutes of live gameplay per match"
5874,"yeah , especially since the tix are so expensive !"
5875,yeah do you follow the espn channel ?
5876,"no , don't really follow espn . anyway , nice chatting with you ! ttyl ."
5877,"i see well when you watch the channel remember this cool fact , they created the first down line , and won an emmy because of it"
5878,thanks !
5879,hi how are you doing there today ? are you good ?
5880,"i'm good , a little peeved at jameis winston saying has to teach his son to respect women when he was suspended for groping a woman"
5881,why do guys do this ? do they think that they are going to get away with it ? now ? ! not likely .
5882,"i don't know , winston was also accused of rape in 2012 when he was still in college"
5883,some people can control themselves and need to be supervised or punished .
5884,it's ridiculous that he's engage and still acted so horribly
5885,nfl has had a lot of problems with player behavior . i think the league needs to take a stronger stand .
5886,"the teams too , the buccaneers still stood by winston despite his character history"
5887,"yes , there should be a team level punishment to drive the point home . behave . you are a public figure ."
5888,"yea , the only thing the bucs did was start ryan fitzpatrick , but at the end of the season winston was the starter again"
5889,the money is the thing . you get them to pay cash and they will start to pay attention .
5890,"i guess so . it's funny is cheerleaders are held to a more strict standard than the players , they are forced to leave if a nfl player comes into a restaurant they are in"
5891,that is sexism and misogyny . what is that rule still around ?
5892,"i have no idea . i wonder what the discipline would look like if there were female players , there are no rules barring them"
5893,i think that women could play . really i twould be better to start the sport at the high school level .
5894,only if you have good coaches . tom brady's jv coach never started him despite the team not winning a game
5895,the man was an idiot not to see that talent . tb was a talent in waiting . just needed his opportunity .
5896,"so was cumberland's coach in 1916 , they lost to georgia tech 2220"
5897,"why would any coach do that to a team ? it seems cruel . anyway , great chat !"
5898,"i don't know , i wonder why kellan moore was the only left handed qb in the nfl"
5899,i don't know either . maybe coaches don't like lefties ? have a good day !
5900,you too
5901,hi ! my favorite part of the superbowl are the commercials . how about you ?
5902,"yes i agree with you on that ! games are so boring , especially since they only averaged about 11 minutes of actual gameplay"
5903,i can't believe that ! technology . . . it changes the world . consider the tracking chips in their shoulder pads . . . guess big brother is always watching !
5904,"yeah that would scare me . i hope that they take those tracking chips off when they leave the field , would you ever wear those outside of sports ?"
5905,"not if i could help it . i mean with my luck , i'd be tracked worse than a saints cheerleader avoiding a player in a restaurant ."
5906,"yeah i don't like how they can't go to a restaurant if a player is inside . or if the player enters them they have to leave , that seems really unfair"
5907,it really is . funny how the world changes . i can't wait for our first female nfl player !
5908,"yes there's no rule against it ! i could see you there being a kicker soon , what do you think the first position would be ?"
5909,quarterback ? maybe that's me dreaming big . then again . . . they had a deaf quarterback once . things happen !
5910,"i think that death quarterback actually invented the circular huddle , which we still use today which is awesome !"
5911,it is ! i can't believe kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback you'd think we had more !
5912,yes and i wonder if it gives him an advantage as well ? you would think that alex smith would have a huge advantage as a quarterback to because he was so smart back in college
5913,"and on the opposite end of the spectrum , we have baker mayfield . from quarterback to professional gamer . . . sign me up !"
5914,"yes absolutely ! he definitely made the right choice going into the nfl , do you know how espn won an emmy though ?"
5915,no ! that's awesome . i like the fact bowlers once made twice as much as nfl players . can it go back to that ? i like bowling .
5916,"yes i like bowling two , i have a better chance of being a professional bowler than being an nfl star haha ."
5917,same ! i wouldn't be rb benjarvus greenellis who's never fumbled the football in his career .
5918,i want him on my team ! but i also love the patriots so am with tom brady would probably be so unfair haha
5919,they need to score like georgia tech vs cumberland 222 to 0 !
5920,"that game was such a blow out ! i wish that we had video cameras to record it back then , or at least espn could have put the yellow line for the first down marker when they were recording that game , maybe it would have helped cumberland to win haha"
5921,"maybe an allpink locker room , just like the university of iowa has ! , would have been their good luck charm ?"
5922,yeah that's possible ! do you think that they won more games or lost more games after that happened ? i would have played a lot better if i were in a pink locker room personally lol
5923,good afternoon . i think alex smith is a great fit for the redskins . what are your thoughts ?
5924,hi how are you ? i dont know much about smith or the redskins . why do you think that ?
5925,"well i think they need to stay ahead in games . smith isn't the kind of quarterback who excels in a shoot outs , it goes against the style of play ."
5926,what is a shoot out in football ? lots of passing ?
5927,yes exactly . like when the redskins play the saints they were down by three scores and people sometimes refer to a comeback like that a shootout .
5928,"ok . so he is not big at comebacks . he is quite a bright guy , right ? finished college in like 10 minutes or something ?"
5929,ha ha yeah basically that fast . he received his bachelors degree in two years .
5930,that is quite fast . he must be a good student . is he still playing in the nfl ?
5931,yes that is very fast . it usually takes four years . i believe you still playing . he did a lot of ap classes in high school so that's how he finished college so fast .
5932,he is still playing . ok . i heard that he sustained an injury . that is a lot of ap tests !
5933,i believe he is set to play next season but i'm not sure . he is righthanded but kellen moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl .
5934,why is there only one ? that seems odd . do coaches not like lefties ?
5935,i'm not sure maybe the plays aren't designed for them ? another smart quarterback is baker mayfield . but he almost became a fulltime competitive gamer .
5936,i guess that could be a good way to make money . i dont how many pros there are in gaming .
5937,i think there's good money but probably not as good as football . it seems like his game was halo 3 .
5938,i have never played halo . i guess it must be pretty challenging . he probably did the right thing going into football .
5939,yes it is a lot of fun to play i recommended . i agree though football is the better choice . the high score ever in a football game was 222 to 0 !
5940,i wonder what the winning coach was thinking . that kind of score seems cruel .
5941,yeah i don't know what georgia tech was thinking that is not a good gesture . poor cumberland . well it was nice chatting with you thanks again .
5942,"yes , i enjoyed chatting !"
5943,have a good one !
5944,do you like football ?
5945,"good evening , yes i do . how about you ?"
5946,i'm a big fan ! do you have a favorite team ? i'm an eagles fan myself .
5947,"yes , don't hate me , but my favorite team is the patriots !"
5948,that's ok . i like them too . in fact i'm a big brady fan . my one grandmother came from the boston area there and i still have cousins there . so i root for them .
5949,"cool , i didn't realize how many people actually loathe the new england patriots and the goat tom brady ."
5950,i actually watched his tom vs time documentary and i love the work ethic he puts into the game . did you know that former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the football in his nfl career ?
5951,"yeah , i had heard that stat and i couldn't begin to imagine the pressure he felt to remain perfect throughout his career . wow !"
5952,i know right ? lol i read that espn won an emmy award for creating the superimposed yellow first down line . never knew they had an emmy award for something like that .
5953,"me either , good for them , though . it's such a part of watching the game , it deserved that award !"
5954,i agree . i go back and watch old games on youtube from like the 70s and 80s when i was a kid and it's just crazy how the graphics have changed since then .
5955,"big difference between then and now , for sure . did you watch the last superbowl ?"
5956,i did and i was rooting for the patriots . i was rooting for them too last year when they lost .
5957,glad to hear that . lol i swear that game seemed it lasted three hours !
5958,lol it did . even towards the end . i liked watching belechik on the sidelines towards the end when they were figuring out what was going on with the gameclock . he looked like he was giving the sideline judge an earfull . lol did you know that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay ?
5959,"oh man , i knew there was alot of wasted time , but didn't think it was all that much , though . kind of makes me mad , now . lol"
5960,short isn't it ?
5961,"so true ! wonder why a woman hasn't played in the nfl , yet ?"
5962,good question . do you know who kellan moore is ? i'm not familiar with him but i see where it says he is the only left handed qb in the nfl .
5963,"yeah , that must be an advantage of some kind ?"
5964,i'm not sure if it would or wouldn't be . lol it's been fun chatting with you ! have a good night and go pats !
5965,hello do you like football ?
5966,it doesn't really catch my attention . maybe because there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game .
5967,yeah thats disappointing lol
5968,i also have trouble following the game . the yellow line has helped a bit . espn won an emmy for creating that .
5969,yes i think that is really helpful ! i hear the nfl uses tracking chips on the players and inside the football
5970,"wow , it's amazing how much technology for football has changed over the years . a while back people didn't seem to care that much about football . in the 60s , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
5971,that must have been a good time to be a bowler !
5972,right ? and i don't think any college football teams these days would lose as bad as cumberland did . they lost 222 to 0 to georgia tech back in 1916 .
5973,wow thats embarrassing .
5974,"yeah , haha . speaking of embarrassing , tom brady's high school coach never started him even though the team was having a historically bad season . they had not won a game or scored a touchdown that season ."
5975,"oh right i read that lol wow did they miss that opportunity , they probably couldve won their season lol"
5976,"yeah , i would feel bad if i were his coach since now he has won the super bowl several times ."
5977,yeah probably kicking himself while watching him play every sunday lol
5978,"ha , true ! what do you think about the 12 . 5 million judgement where the rams have to pay reggie bush 12 . 5 million dollars ? do you think the rams are kicking themselves too ?"
5979,lol yes .
5980,"reggie bush slipped and fell on the at edwards jones dome . he also included the stadium in his lawsuit , though they were dismissed as the judge said the rams had control of the facility on game days ."
5981,"yeah i read . thats kinda like companies getting sued because someone injured themselves on their property though , i guess its whatever ."
5982,the rams lawyer said that reggie bush is one of the most talented running backs and should have avoided the concrete .
5983,yeah i guess he wasnt paying attention
5984,on the other hand reggie argued that the injury cost him 10 to 15 million in future nfl earnings .
5985,well didnt he win the 12 mil ? wouldnt that somewhat compensate for his ' injuries ' lol its been great chatting .
5986,hey do you know anything about football ?
5987,"no , not a thing . i think it is neat the way football means american football , soccer or rugby , depending on where you are ."
5988,"ya i don't watch , but i do know that i like the patriots and they have a rb who has never dropped the ball"
5989,"a running back that has never dropped the ball ? so , this implies american nfl football . it is a dull game to watch , with only 11 minutes of live game play per game ."
5990,"yup i agree , also weird there are no rules against female players , would you watch that ?"
5991,"i think like the gorgeous ladies of wrestling , it has been done . but i would watch some of that . not sure a 17 week season would be fun ."
5992,"ya we would have to see , did you know engineers make more than nfl players over their lifetime ?"
5993,"i believe the word average is very important there . some players never make it big , while most engineers pull money . i wonder why cheerleaders can not be in the same restaurant as a new orleans saint ?"
5994,"ya i don't like that , they shouldn't have to leave , that just sounds outdated , what bout you ?"
5995,an out dated and wrong thing . i be some engineers use chips in players pads to track and record players movement . those engineers get paid more than the player .
5996,"those tracking chips scare me , i wouldn't want someone to know my every move , hopefully they just keep those on the field"
5997,"on the field and the one in the ball . to bad the balls from tom brandies deflate gate were not monitored for air pressure . the ball measures velocity , rotation and location ."
5998,do you have a favorite quarterback ? and did you know kellan moore was left handed
5999,i have no favorite . i would think left handed would be an advantage . most players would expect the ball to be in a certain location . kellan would be a little off that . the offensive team leader that touches the ball the most .
6000,"yup i think it gives an advantage being left handed , did you hear about the deaf quarterback who invented the circular huddle"
6001,such a important innovation . now everyone does it . or maybe stadium is so loud no one can hear . there was a qb who wanted to be a pro gambler . oklahoma player i think .
6002,"good thing he chose football , baker mayfield was going to be a professional gamer and play halo 3"
6003,there are many things bout the game that seem like video games . take the line for the first down . we expect it . espn won an emmy for its creation .
6004,"that was a great creation for sure , very useful , also i never knew alex smith was a genius he got his degree in only 2 years"
6005,good for alex . i wonder if he picked a useful major like engineering . in the 1960's pro bowlers made as much as top football stars . i wonder if engineers make more than bowlers ?
6006,they do actually ! a lot more over the course of their lifetimes which is crazy !
6007,hey how often do you watch the nfl ? i know i watch football from time to time on tv
6008,i watch one in a while . i find the games boring sometimes . they only play an average of 11 minutes per game !
6009,yep you're right about that ! that probably explains why the super bowl was a little bit boring this year haha . do you think that women should play in the nfl by the way ?
6010,"i know there's no rule saying they can't , so i guess if they can meet the requirements , they should probably be allowed ."
6011,"yeah i can see that . i think we could see a female player in our lifetime , it's the only fair thing , as long as they're good enough to play they should be allowed to play i think"
6012,"yeah , they might as well get a fair shot . some of the rules of the nfl are still sexist . like how some cheerleaders can't eat at a restaurant where players are eating"
6013,"yeah i don't like that rule . i think it's really stupid and not appropriate in this day and age . i just don't get how that one has been sued yet about it lol , have you heard about the tracking chips that they use too"
6014,"yeah , that's pretty cool . some things like that are so high tech . like the yellow first down line that espn won an emmy for !"
6015,"that's really genius by the way . i'm glad they won an emmy for that , it's definitely necessary for enjoying games on the tv i think . but yes the tracking chips can track players movements and speed , i think that's pretty useful"
6016,i agree ! they are in the footballs and shoulder pads ! do you know what the score of the highest scoring football game ever was ?
6017,i don't . what was it ? i do know that back in the sixties the top bowlers made more than the top football players of the time . now that is totally reversed today . haha !
6018,that's amazing ! the highest score was 2220 ! but it was a college game .
6019,wow that's crazy ! what year did happen ? i would have loved to see that game haha . do you think that the losing team had their locker room painted pink perhaps lol . i guess the university of iowa's football team did that to the opposing players
6020,"it was way back in 1916 . that's pretty funny , actually . i wonder what the visiting teams thought of that ."
6021,"yeah i wonder that too , what do you think about the patriots by the way ? did you know that they have a player who's never fumbled the ball ? his name is benjarvus greenellis"
6022,"i am kind of sick of them being in the super bowl every year , it's boring ! he must feel a lot of pressure never to get his first fumble !"
6023,"yeah i agree . i would feel so stressed every time i played haha . what do you think about alex smith by the way ? man is so smart , he got his bachelor's degree in only 2 years and then went to play for the nfl"
6024,"that's pretty cool . he was the first pick in the 2005 draft , too !"
6025,"oh that's cool ! i really like the story behind the circular huddle , it was created by a deaf quarterback in order to block the other team from seeing his hand signs , that's really cool"
6026,"that's brilliant , actually ! there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ."
6027,"i think that's kellen moore right ? also there's only one quarterback who is almost going to be a professional video game player , and that was baker mayfield , i think he made the right decision haha ."
6028,good morning .
6029,good morning ! do you like football ?
6030,"yes , i love football . do you ?"
6031,"i've never really watched it . although it seems the qb here is pretty smart . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a junior . the quarterback received his bachelor's degree in two years , and began working on a master's degree , before becoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft ."
6032,"wow , that's cool . the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink"
6033,"trauma ! the circular huddle used in todays american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not read his hand signals ."
6034,in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars
6035,isn't that crazy ? kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl
6036,that is hard to believe . wow .
6037,i know ! the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220
6038,that's crazy . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay
6039,i know ! and it last about 2 . 5 hours ! former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
6040,"new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave ."
6041,isn't that crazy ? espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games .
6042,"nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
6043,i always wondered how they knew how fast the ball was flying !
6044,"yeah , technology has really helped them ."
6045,"a singleelimination tournament culminating in the super bowl , which is usually held in the first sunday in february , and is played between the champions of the nfc and afc ."
6046,"wow , that's neat . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player ."
6047,"sports commonly called football in certain places include association football , known as soccer in some countries ,"
6048,thanks for the information . i enjoyed .
6049,me too ! have a good day !
6050,you as well
6051,": ,"
6052,can you click done ?
6053,"yes , i think so ."
6054,hello do you like football ?
6055,i do ! i'm a big fan !
6056,"oh good , yeah football is very entertaining ."
6057,yes it is ! the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink . wonder why they did that ?
6058,"i think its a mental tactic , like to make them feel calm or something"
6059,that would make sense . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of that era . i'm sure that's not like that any longer .
6060,"yeah i doubt it also , bowling isnt what it used to be . football players get paid a ton lol"
6061,lol the highest scoring football game ever was when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 in 1916 . talk about a blowout !
6062,"ouch , thats embarassing ! thats a huge loss !"
6063,no doubt ! espn won an emmy for creating the yellow superimposed first down line you see on tv while watching games . i didn't even know they gave out emmy's for something like that .
6064,honestly me either lol but good for them that digital line has been really helpful on screens and tvs .
6065,yes ! lol former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball in his nfl career . impressive !
6066,"thats crazy , how does someone not fumble for their whole career , thats great . there is also only one left handed quarter back in the nfl weird huh"
6067,i'm not sure . lol that is amazing that there is only 1 left handed qb .
6068,the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback
6069,what was his name ? i can't remember it .
6070,paul d hubbard
6071,nice ! the nfl has no written rule against female players . wonder if we will see one ever ?
6072,"maybe , but there's too much injury in football"
6073,true . the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . relatively short compared to how long they stretch the games out . it's been fun chatting !
6074,"great chatting , have a good one ."
6075,"hello there , are you a fan of the nfl ?"
6076,"i am actually , its wild that an nfl game only has about 11 mins of gameplay on average"
6077,"isn't that crazy , i think you notice all the stops and stuff more when you attend a live game ."
6078,"ya i haven't been to a live game in years , what do you think of the way the saints cheerleaders have to act when outside of the field ?"
6079,i think that rule is a bit outdated . i think they should have standard rules within normal laws that everyone else follows .
6080,"ya i agree , it's so dumb they have to leave a restaurant if a player walks in for instance"
6081,exactly . did you read that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average nfl players ?
6082,"that is crazy , but nfl players also don't play their whole lives they retire early , so who knows"
6083,"i think that is what it is , is that the engineer's career is far longer than the average nfl career ."
6084,"yup exactly , also crazy is the nfl could one day have female players"
6085,i think that would be so cool if a female player did make a pro roster . i think it would huge for young sports fans .
6086,"ya , i think a female could become a kicker or maybe a quarterback , we shall definitely see"
6087,that would be cool to see a female quarterback one day .
6088,haha ya maybe she'd paint her locker room pink like the iowa team did for opposing players haha
6089,"that is so funny , i wonder who was in charge over there that gave the final ok for it , or if they just did it as a prank and then officials left it that way ."
6090,"haha ya i do wonder that , i also wonder how a team can lose in football 2220 !"
6091,that is just insane . i wonder if they just scored a touchdown on every single play ?
6092,"ya i don't know , but it would suck to be a cumberland fan on that day and get destroyed like that haha"
6093,yeah i wonder how many fans were actually still there when the 222 point was scored ?
6094,"oh ya , if i were a georgia tech fan even i would have left when it reached 100 to 0 haha"
6095,"right lol . well it was nice talking with you today , i hope you have a good day ."
6096,are you a fan of the ravens ?
6097,"not a huge ravens fan , you ? i like football though and luckily there are 32 teams so plenty of variation ."
6098,did you know that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
6099,"that is surprising i don't even know of him . but i do know baker mayfield , and he sounds like he was a big gamer ."
6100,"interesting , is this the guy that was going to be a video game pro ?"
6101,yeah he apparently loved to play halo 3 !
6102,"interesting , is that for ps4 or xbox ? i have neither but was interested in getting one of them ."
6103,xbox i believe . he claims he could have beaten anyone at the university of oklahoma .
6104,"interesting , did he get paid for doing this ?"
6105,i don't believe he did . another smart quarterback was alex smith ! he took a lot of ap classes .
6106,i think he was working on his masters degree before being drafted .
6107,very impressive . he was the first overall pick in the 2005 draft !
6108,"yeah , that seems pretty cool . the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of gameplay ."
6109,so many ads for all that ? also girls are legally allowed to play !
6110,they are . and they also put chips in the players shoulderpads .
6111,no wonder they get such accurate stats and info about players movements on the field .
6112,"yeah , apparently there are chips in the balls as well . pretty crazy if you ask me ."
6113,"oh wow . and they can track velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location . cool ."
6114,"yeah , it is pretty cool . although i'm not entirely sure what you would do with all that information . well , it was nice chatting with you !"
6115,yeah i would like to know that too . knowing the nfl they use it to make more money ! you as well there partner .
6116,"exactly , probably some type of advertising gimmic . take it easy !"
6117,"hi there , do you watch the nfl much ?"
6118,"hey ! i love the nfl , but sadly don't get to follow it much , how about you ?"
6119,"yeah same here , but i do watch some of the games . do you know who baker mayfield is ?"
6120,isn't he the quarterback who almost quit football to have a career in competitive gaming ?
6121,yup that is him . and he still says that he can beat anyone at u of oklahoma in halo 3
6122,"wow , i have heard about that , lol . . . pretty cool ! but being a quarterback has probably been the better choice for him . do you know who kellan moore is ?"
6123,"yeah , isn't he the guy who is the only qb in the nfl that is lefthanded ?"
6124,"yep , pretty rare ! kinda rare like patriots r . b benjarvus green ellis who never fumbled a football ever in his entire nfl career !"
6125,what a talent . do you like brady too ? heard he was a backup qb in high school and they never started him .
6126,i am a huge tom brady fan . that is crazy ! big mistake on their part by not letting him play . he is an amazing qb .
6127,"exactly , he has come a long way for sure . how about alex smith ? he is talented and super smart it seems"
6128,"exactly , he is very smart . kinda like the huddle that was created by that deaf quarterback !"
6129,"yeah that is so cool , what a way to communicate with your team while others have no clue what you are saying ."
6130,"right ! genius . football has come so far , it is crazy how pro bowlers used to make more money than top football stars . crazy !"
6131,"i k now , things have changed so much now for sure . did you know women can play in the nfl ?"
6132,i have heard that because the nfl allows them to play if they meet their requirements which i can't imagine a female wanting to go up against such huge men lol . . . could happen though . i think it's awful that the cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same place as the new orleans saints . . . .
6133,that rule is so wrong and the worst part about it is the fact that they have to leave midmeal if the players walk in
6134,"i know ! not right , makes you wonder why . . . that surely can't be how it is in today's times , but you never know what rules are hidden within the nfl . . ."
6135,"yeah i am not sure either , i just hope it goes away soon . on a happier note , they are putting tracking chips on the players now to record a variety of things"
6136,"i have heard that the nfl is doing that , to track the players moves and the football velocity and rotation . . . very clever !"
6137,"yeah , hope they can use that to reduce concussions and such too . nice chatting with you ."
6138,"do you think that tie games in the nfl are good , bad or are you indifferent ?"
6139,indifferent . a lot of people think it is fine .
6140,i really don't like sudden death types of dealing with it . there should be a clear winner .
6141,why do you think so ? some people think that a tie should not be seen as less satisfying .
6142,i was referring to a sudden death victory . i wasn't clear there should be more time on the clock . a tie is ok with me .
6143,"i am not an expert . however , i admire some nfl teams ."
6144,i prefer college when it comes to american football . the excitement in things like ' going for it ' is the same .
6145,i prefer college footballs better no money is involved in it . do you know that nfl has no rule against female players ?
6146,agree . i did . i wonder if the ncaa does . it's probably more of a universitybyuniversity rule .
6147,probably . do you know that average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay ? what do you think about it ?
6148,i played football in hs and there's a lot of standing around so i believe it . what i can't believe is that the u . of iowa has a pink locker room for visitors .
6149,i heard about it . why do they do that ? why pink ?
6150,i heard there are colors that calm and subdue like pink . some jails are that color . causes for design . . . huddle are circular since a qb named hubbard was deaf . it makes sense for me if one isn't deaf .
6151,i read about it . he did not want the other team to read his hand signals .
6152,"makes sense . . . what doesn't make sense is that georgia tech , my alma mater , ran up the score 2220 against cumberland . not too proud of that . . ."
6153,are you serious ? but georgia tech won though . shouldn't you be proud ?
6154,maybe if it were alabama but to humiliate poor cumberland isn't too cool . like not letting saints cheerleaders dine around saints players doesn't seem too cool .
6155,you are funny . cumberland humiliated themselves .
6156,"so your not one for chivalry it seems to be dying like masculinity . things change . . . in the 60's , top bowlers made more than top football stars ."
6157,i read about it ? now bowlers make pennies compared to football players .
6158,that makes sense . bowlers don't have to stare down a 330 lbs . guard . nor do they have to constantly reach espn's yellow line . do you want to continue ?
6159,i'm good . it was nice chatting with you . talk to you again next time .
6160,hi do you follow the nfl ?
6161,"yea , the giants are my favorite team but i keep up with all 32 teams"
6162,nice ! i'm a steelers fan . how about odell being traded to the browns ?
6163,"he's an awesome player but becomes a liability due to his temperament , the giants aren't gonna be doing too well even if they kept him i just wish they got better picks for him"
6164,i agree . that trade caught me off guard when i saw it last night . now on to some facts . . lol the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room comlpetely pink . no idea why !
6165,maybe iowa thinks the pink locker room will cause the visiting team to play worse
6166,lol maybe . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of that era . way different now i'm sure .
6167,"yea i never even thought bowlers made much money , let alone more than football stars"
6168,"i know ! i think bowling was really popular back then along with horse racing , boxing , and baseball . all 3 of those sports have changed in fan attraction over the decades ."
6169,"yea , sports are constantly evolving , like the invention of the circular huddle by paul d hubbard"
6170,was he the deaf qb who invented it so the other team couldn't read his hand signals ?
6171,"yea , i wonder if the only left handed qb kellan moore invented any special techniques"
6172,you would think he would have something different in his delivery of the ball .
6173,"yea , i wonder if alex smith has different mechanics considering he's really smart , he started college as a junior"
6174,that's a great story of his ! once in he completed and graduated with a bachelor's deegree in only 2 years !
6175,"yea he's a smart dude but i'm not so sure about baker mayfield , he considered playing games professionally instead of playing football"
6176,i know that sounds crazy . how about former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis . he never fumbled the ball in his nfl career .
6177,"that's pretty cool , i wonder if playing for bill belichick had any thing to do with greenellis never fumbling"
6178,might have . do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was ? it was nice chatting by the way .
6179,"i know georgia tech scored 222 point back in 1916 , i wonder if they cheated at all"
6180,haha maybe they did . what a blowout ! sorry i have to run . have a good day !
6181,hi ! do you follow football ?
6182,"hi , somewhat . do you ?"
6183,a little here and there . i enjoy it more when my team is doing well .
6184,i hear that . no fun to watch a bad team . i guess the chargers are doing pretty well .
6185,i agree . their last victory over arizona sure was dominant !
6186,"yeah , 4510 is no joke ! not as big a victory as georgia tech over cumberland in 1916 . did you see that score ?"
6187,"yeah , i am not sure how that is even possible ! 2220 ? its like they were scoring the whole game !"
6188,when you break it down they probably had to score like a touchdown a minute or something ? guess cumberland's defense didn't show up that day !
6189,"yeah , nor their offense . probably a lot of defensive points scored too ."
6190,true . if they were playing at iowa i would blame their performance on the color of the visitor's locker room . pink !
6191,"i wonder what shade of pink it is ? more powdery , neon , magenta like ?"
6192,good question . my guess would be whichever messes with their opponents heads the most .
6193,"speaking of colors , did you know espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow line ?"
6194,"no , i didn't know that . it has completely changed watching a game on tv . makes it easier anyway ."
6195,it certainly does . when my mom when to my brothers first live hs game she didnt understand at first why the line wasnt there .
6196,that's funny ! i can't believe benjarvus greeellis never fumbled . that seems impossible !
6197,it does . i wonder how many carries he had in the game . even some of the greats fumbled a bit .
6198,that's another good question . it'd be way less impressive if he only had a couple of touches a game .
6199,or per a short career .
6200,very true . hard to believe tom brady sat on the bench in high school !
6201,"it is , they definitely didnt recognize the talent and potential in front of them !"
6202,"no doubt , i bet they feel like fools now ! it's been fun . have a great day !"
6203,are you a fan of the nfl ?
6204,"i am , especially the vikings ! how about you ?"
6205,"i like the redskins , but i'm from that area . did you know kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ?"
6206,that is crazy to believe because there have been so many great left handed quarterbacks in the league !
6207,"yeah , there has been . i wonder if it is a function of setting up the offense ?"
6208,maybe its because a lot of plays go to the right ? i would be curious to see with all the technology they have !
6209,"yeah , that would be pretty cool . apparently there are chips in the shoulder pads ."
6210,is that so ? is it to track player movement on the field ?
6211,"i think it is , but i'm not sure . they also have chips in the ball ."
6212,"that is awesome ! i heard that it tracks velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location !"
6213,interesting . is the data shared with both teams ?
6214,i'm sure it's for the league haha . maybe espn uses it too . you know they won an emmy for the yellow line ?
6215,for the first down marker ? that's pretty cool !
6216,it is ! did you ever hear about the georgia tech and cumberland game that was 2220 ? that would be sad to see haha .
6217,"wow ! that is a crazy score , is that real ?"
6218,it did ! in 1916 lol . they must have been psyched out with their locker room being pink like the iowa hawkeyes do to their opponents .
6219,"hilarious , you would think that would make the other team angry though ."
6220,i bet ! would you rather been a football player or bowler in the 1960's when bowlers made twice as much as football players ?
6221,"that would be pretty crazy , i'm actually not a bad bowler . well , nice chatting with you !"
6222,"i'm a terrible bowler haha . nice chatting with you as well , have a great day !"
6223,you too ! have a good one !
6224,"hello , how are you ?"
6225,"good , how about yourself ?"
6226,"pretty good , do you know anything about football ?"
6227,"yes , i do . ."
6228,"so , i am trying to understand what's going on with article section 1 . whatever galette has caused , he slowly ranked lower . . ."
6229,i heard junior galette from washinton might be a free agent next year .
6230,"interesting , . . . agent for one of the players ?"
6231,"he going to see if a new team wants to sign him next year . he probably won't garner much interest , because he's very injury prone . ."
6232,"true , since he injured his achilles ."
6233,"plus his sack numbers were down . he use to be good when he played for the new orleans saints , but i think his best days are behind him ."
6234,"well , he seemed overwhelmed from the start ."
6235,"his current team really cut his playing time , which according to him , limits his opportunity to sack the quarterback ."
6236,"and his fans are rooting for him to go back to the redskins , however , that is not easy ."
6237,junior galette has had a slew off trouble off the field . he was even accused of domestic violence .
6238,"i think from there , he slowly went downhill ."
6239,"plus , there are a lot better young players on the redskins , namely ryan anderson ."
6240,"that is true , but it is sad for galette to see the reality of his consequences that were caused from his past ."
6241,hopefully if he stays with the redskins he can return to his former glory . he did rank third on the team in quarterback pressures .
6242,he needs to step up his game . get more training and keep his head up .
6243,"there is a loyal fan base in washington , i'm sure everyone wants to see him do better next season ."
6244,"i agree . hopefully , he browses through this to keep his spirits up . this will remind him how much his fans believes in him ."
6245,i'll be rooting for him .
6246,what do you think about the baltimore ravens ? they just drafted lamar jackson
6247,i'm not a huge fan because i'm a bengals fan lol . same division . i'm surprised they got rid of flacco .
6248,yeah i'm surprised too . who is your favorite quarterback by the way ? i always loved tom brady haha
6249,my favorite is probably patrick mahomes .
6250,"yeah he's good too . i also like baker mayfield a lot , especially because he used to play halo 3 which is one of my favorite games"
6251,did you know kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl ?
6252,"no i didn't know that , i wonder if it gives him an advantage though ? i do know about alex smith , he's actually really smart and almost got his master's degree , he even got his bachelor's and only two years before he was drafted"
6253,alex smith is an awesome guy . did you know russell wilson is still under an mlb contract ?
6254,"no i didn't know that , how do you think that works ? would they actually try to use him ? i like football a lot more than mlb anyway"
6255,not too sure how that works . i don't think they would actually use him .
6256,well that's good . i wonder if the nfl would ever use a female player ? do you think that will happen in our lifetime
6257,i saw they don't have a written rule against it . i bet we will see a female kicker before long .
6258,"yes i could see that . i just don't know that an nfl game only lasts 11 minutes of live gameplay , you'd think that it would last longer because it can take up to two hours on tv"
6259,that is crazy it is only 11 minutes of gameplay .
6260,"well that is crazy . but also crazy is the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player , it's lower than the average earnings of a engineer . now that is crazy haha"
6261,that is very crazy . i would have never guessed that .
6262,i would have not guessed that cheerleaders would have to leave a restaurant if an actual player from their team came in . did you hear about the new orleans saints ? and the cheerleaders for them ?
6263,that's interesting . i heard many teams have rules around players and cheerleaders .
6264,"rules seem unnecessary but i also don't play football haha , i wonder if there's a rule against painting a locker room pink for instance"
6265,lol i wonder if that works ?
6266,i wonder that too ! i wonder if the university of iowa's record improved or got worse after they painted the opposing team's locker room pink
6267,hello ! are you interested in football ?
6268,hi how are you ? i have talked about football quite a bit recently . i guess i am still interested . lol
6269,agreed ! i watch frequently too though . i did not know that the average game has only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay .
6270,those players have a pretty sweet job ! standing and waiting then they get to beat each other up . sweet !
6271,not sure how i would handle the same job . they have tracking chips ni their pads to know their speed for a reason .
6272,"yes , i hope that helps prevent injury and concussion . the game takes a toll on the body . i would rather be an engineer ."
6273,"yea , its a hard game to play . why an engineer ?"
6274,they make good money over the long haul . plus fewer concussions . lol
6275,"exactly ! i can run , but couldnt take a hit ! do you have a favorite team"
6276,"at the moment , no . i usually just root for the underdog in the superbowl . i like to see upsets ."
6277,me too . i wish i could have seen the rams win this year .
6278,"the rams had a great team , but it is hard to beat tom , bill and the gang ."
6279,it was a boring game because both teams played defense quite well .
6280,"yeah , a defensive battle is not a crowd pleaser . people want touchdowns ."
6281,"yea , like when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 for the highest score recorded in a game ."
6282,what was going through the coachs head then ? that is a horrible thing to do to another team ?
6283,might not be completely intentional . happened in a game here in the upper midwest like 80 plus points for one team . happens when one team gets all the right bounces .
6284,"true , but the coach should put in the third string or something . even the cheerleaders maybe ."
6285,could be fun to watch for some . the nfl does that with second or third string
6286,"yeah , its only fair . if your team is winning by that much , you should ease up . it is a sport , not a war . anyway , great chat !"
6287,you too ! have a great day !
6288,did you know there is a university team whose visiting locker room is painted pink ?
6289,yes . i did know that . it is iowa . i think that is great competition .
6290,"ya i would like to see some stats to see if that , on average , affects the players , i bet it does , also crazy that in the 60's bowlers made more money that football players back then"
6291,true . it is value based on audience . the nfl has the eyeballs now . i do love that yellow line that espn added to football broadcasts .
6292,"ya that's interesting , i also like that the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback , i wonder how he would call an audible if he was deaf though ?"
6293,he would call the audible by talking . only he would not hear it . espn got an emmy for that yellow line .
6294,"ah that makes sense i guess , i don't like the nfl personally , it doesn't surprise me that there are only about 11 minutes of actual gameply in the average game , i think it is pretty boring"
6295,i agree . i greatly prefer college ball with many more plays . the global family of games called football all have some way to score involving kicking . it is pretty minor in us football i think .
6296,"yes that is true , also surprising is that in the nfl there is no written rule against female football players , and that women could play if they met the league's requirements"
6297,"wouldn't you be embarrassed to be the coach of a jv team . never win , never score , have tom brady as you backup qb and never let him play ?"
6298,"yeah that would be embarrassing , also its crazy that on average an engineer makes more in his lifetime than the average nfl player , i wonder if its because of the injuries they can get"
6299,it is just a short career . the average running back lasts 4 years . the qbs today make a lot though . imagine if baker mayfield had quit football to be a gamer . he would not have been cashing the big checks that he does today .
6300,"ah interesting , that is true , i saw that baker was the halo 3 champion of his college , i was really good at halo 1 and 2 i won a lot of tournaments when i was younger , did you ever play games ?"
6301,"never played halo , but i went to oklahoma university so i watched every college game he played . alex smith took so many ap tests that he entered college as a junior . my grandson is taking a lot which will save his parents money ."
6302,"ah that is good , i took 4 ap tests when i went to college and passed all of them , so i saved money , still have some student loans but it is more managable than it otherwise would be haha"
6303,do you play nfl fantasy football . you play 17 weeks from sept to dec even though each team only plays 16 games .
6304,"no i don't play that , i have friends who do and they always lose money haha . i did see that there is political fantasy that you can play , on whether each side passes certain bills and such , that's probably more to my liking because i follow politics more than football"
6305,it is hard to be an optimist when one follows politics closely . we are so polarized . i would not mind giving political fantasy a try .
6306,"yes i agree , it is bad because it can make you depressed but unfortunately it interests me and has an actual affect on my life , so i pay attention to it , do you play fantasy football ?"
6307,no . but my grown son plays in 5 leagues and makes between 500 and 800 each year .
6308,"well that is impressive , i know there is luck but apparently skill if he can win that consistently , anyway great talking with you !"
6309,"hi , how are you ?"
6310,i'm good . but just frustrated with the buccaneers for losing so horribly to the bears !
6311,"i don't know much about football , though i've heard some things . are you a big fan ?"
6312,"i watch it from time to time . do you know what a quarterback , often referred to as a qb , is ?"
6313,"yeah , that is the most important position on the team , right ? touches the ball on every play ?"
6314,"exactly . but you see , the main quarterback for the buccaneers didn't get much chance to play against the bears , and that led to their disaster ! makes me so upset ."
6315,that's too bad . who are the big name qbs in the league now ?
6316,i'd say the best has to be tom brady . but did you know that his high school team never even let him play ! ?
6317,what ? that's strange . how did he get to play in college then ? i thought you had to be a star to do that .
6318,i have no idea . but i think the buccaneers' defensive coordinator mike smith needs to go back to college ! he let tampa score six touchdowns against them ! so dumb !
6319,"well , that should be the end of his job . there are plenty of high school jobs out there i'm sure . maybe he could coach a girl's team ."
6320,"ha ha , true . and oops , i meant he let the bears score six touchdowns , my bad . my anger got me flustered there ha ha ."
6321,the nfl has no written rule against female players . do you think we'll ever see women players ?
6322,we could ! maybe one or two in the future . if they ever play against the university of iowa then i'm sure they'll appreciate the pink locker room there !
6323,i guess maybe the bucs defensive guy would suffer from pink lockerroom syndrome or something .
6324,"some kind of syndrome , that's for sure . they've got a lot of issues . one of their players , winston , was even accused of groping a woman a few years back . sad state they're in ."
6325,i don't understand the need for that behavior . maybe that's why no saints have a rule about cheerleaders with players .
6326,"yeah , maybe that's why that weird rule exists ha ha ! do you think they actually force the cheerleaders to leave when a player walks in the restaurant ?"
6327,"i have to wonder what the consequences are . the players might get fined , or the cheerleaders fired , or something . i don't know . it seems sexist ."
6328,"very sexist , indeed . i think they need to use one of their bye weeks to think over that rule and update it to meet modern standards ."
6329,"true . anyway , great chat !"
6330,same to you . hope you have a better day than those buccaneers had . bye !
6331,do you like football ?
6332,i do . i am a fan of the ravens and lamar jackson . you ?
6333,i like the patriots who are like the lannisters of football
6334,i have never heard of the lannisters . i do know that the ravens are implementing the prostyle offense after watching philadelphia tear apart the patriots defense with it .
6335,oh lannister is a reference to games of thrones
6336,gotcha . we have a great center named bozeman he was on alabama when they won the national championship .
6337,which position do you follow ?
6338,"i like watching all of the players sometimes the quarterback hands it off to the running back , other times he does a pass to a receiver ."
6339,i also like how the quarterback is the core of any offensive
6340,yes the quarterback makes the decision about what to do depending on what the defense is doing . he is in charge .
6341,i wonder how hard it is for kellan moore as a lefty
6342,yes he is the only left handed quarterback . alex smith is a quarterback who was working on his masters degree when he got drafted ! he is smart !
6343,did you know the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback ?
6344,yes so they could hide their signals from the other team ! that is brilliant i think !
6345,i wonder what paul hubbard's performance was like though
6346,i am not sure . probably better than the other quarterback in tom brady's high school . his coach would never even start tom !
6347,either he hated tom or just wanted to spare him the humiliation since the team was having the worst season in history
6348,yes that is pretty crazy especially since tom went on to win 4 super bowls
6349,wasn't he like the biggest steal in nfl history ?
6350,without a doubt the super bowl is the ultimate championship in the nfl and he has won it 4 times
6351,"indeed . in any case , thanks for chatting . i hope you have a wonderful day ."
6352,did you watch the playoffs this weekend for the nfl ?
6353,"i didn't , you ? did the panthers win ?"
6354,"i don't think so , but i'm not sure . the saints and patriots won . the washington redskins had been humiliated by the saints in a prior week"
6355,did you see this game ? the green bay packers got trounced by the detroit lions .
6356,i watched the eagles get beat by the saints . . . too bad . the redskins coach jay gruden told les carpenter the team has a ' cloud looming over our head with issues we have to clean up . ' i don't think they cleaned them up because i didn't see the redskins in the playoffs . did you ?
6357,"no , i don't watch football myself . i do see this too . josh norman , the highest paid player at the position , is ' in love with being a celebrity right now and not necessarily being a football player . '"
6358,"with that much money and attention , that must be what one aims for . new england had the seventhworst pass rush in the nfl this season but still made it to the playoffs"
6359,apparently the patriots have trouble getting a passer . thats got to really affect the game they play .
6360,maybe they need some pink in their locker rooms like the university of iowa visiting football locker rooms . that way the bright colors can waken them up .
6361,they need it ! the patriots also have the 7th worst pass rush in the nfl .
6362,"yes , that's what i said previously . i like how i know when the team will get a first down because of the yellow line superimposed on the field . did you hear that espn invented that and got an emmy for it ?"
6363,"i'm sorry , i didn't see that earlier . i did hear that about espn . i also heard that former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career ."
6364,"must be a fantastic player . i'm surprised i haven't heard more about him . the circle huddle was created by paul d . hubbard a deaf quarterback so other teams couldn't get his hand signals . great idea , huh ?"
6365,very good idea ! totally remade football . glad he gets the credit for it . did you see the female football ref ? the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements . she is huge . i bet she could play football .
6366,"no , i didn't know that . that is cool . did you hear about the highest score ever football game that was 2200 with georgia tech winning ."
6367,that had to be in the very beginning of football since an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
6368,top bowlers in the 60's made twice as much as top football stars .
6369,did you know that tom brady went to junipero serra high school ?
6370,"yes , that is correct . i heard they didn't even start him at quarterback and now he's a 4 time super bowl champ !"
6371,i wonder if it hurt his confidence back then ? alex smith sure is smart too .
6372,it must have made him work harder . you're not kidding ! smith took so many ap tests and entered university as a junior . what a hardworking individual .
6373,good morning ! do you watch football ?
6374,morning ! i do ! i try to watch it every week during the regular season . how about you ?
6375,same here ! do you watch college football ?
6376,"nah not really , thats a little bit too much for me to follow and the teams are always changing around"
6377,"oh that's too bad . those games can get really good ! speaking of , the highest scoring football game ever was a college game . georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 back in 1916 ."
6378,holy cow ! i wonder how that happened haha thats such a huge amount of points scored
6379,it really is ! i wish there was a video record of it to see just what happened . i can only guess that cumberland had no defense whatsoever .
6380,i know id like to watch that game and see what happened . did you know snoop dogg wrote the fight song for his high school team ? haha it must have been a good song
6381,i didn't know that ! that's pretty cool !
6382,and apparently the highest paid people in the us defense dept are all football coaches from the service branch teams . that seems unnecessary to me
6383,"you know , it does to me too . in the defense dept the highest paid people should be the people defending the country . back in the '60s bowlers made twice as much as football players ."
6384,i wonder how much bowlers were paid ? or how little a football player was paid . it is definitely the opposite today
6385,"that's for sure . now football is so popular that like you said , coaches in the defense dept are high paid and tv stations can win emmys for making yellow lines ."
6386,well the yellow line espn made is revolutionary and changed the televised game forever for the better
6387,"true and i love it too . it makes the game much more exciting to know just how far a team has to go to get that first down . it's just , an emmy ?"
6388,eh i dunno ! they give out some strange awards apparently haha
6389,"i guess they do at that ! oh hey , have you heard about the university of iowa's locker room for visiting teams ?"
6390,"yea i heard it was painted pink , must be some kind of psychological warfare !"
6391,i think so too ! it's kind of funny in a way also . i like that they are so blatantly obvious with their warfare .
6392,i know right ? did you know kellen moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl ?
6393,"no ! i had no idea ! honestly though , i guess i just don't pay attention to what hand they throw from . sounds like i may need to . well , it's time for me to go now . it's been great chatting with you ! have a great day !"
6394,hey do you think the rams will go undefeated this year ?
6395,"hi how are you ? um , i dont know . how did they do last year ?"
6396,"i think they played pretty well last year , but right now they are at 8 and 0 , and it is halfway through the year so they have a chance to go undefeated"
6397,"well , i guess they could . i dont follow nfl too much until late in the season ."
6398,well let me ask you this who is your favorite quarterback ? i like kellen moore because he's lefthanded haha just like me
6399,is he still in the league ? i wonder why there is only one lefty .
6400,"yes i wonder that too . and i think he is but i'm not 100 percent sure , what do you think about alex smith by the way ?"
6401,is he the qb that did college in like 10 minutes or something ?
6402,haha well he passed a lot of ap tests and was working on his master's degree before he was drafted so he's definitely a genius
6403,wow . the guy has the kind of mind you need for qb . is he still playing ?
6404,i think he is . but i don't watch a lot of football so i'm not one hundred percent sure . do you know how the circular huddle was invented by the way ?
6405,i figured it was just a basic part of the game .
6406,"no it was actually invented by a deaf quarterback , he would use the huddle to block the other team from seeing his hand signs"
6407,"oh , i guess that makes sense . i am amazed that he could play . he must have been quite good ."
6408,"yes he probably was . it's interesting though that women are actually allowed to play in the nfl if they qualify , there is no rule against them playing"
6409,i can't imagine a women who meet the physical requirements to deal with the contact positions . maybe kicker ?
6410,"yeah i think a kicker could be possible . it's crazy though that they use tracking chips on players and the balls now , that way they can track the location and speed of the players on the field , hopefully they use this to help prevent injuries"
6411,i think the data could be used for many purposes . maybe it could help with safety at the college and high school level too .
6412,yes i hope so . did you hear about how cheerleaders are treated in the nfl ? apparently they can't even dine in the same restaurant as a player without having to leave
6413,"no eating with players ? odd outdated sexist rule . anyway , great chat !"
6414,yes it was a great chat ! and keep an eye out for benjarvus greenellis on the patriots ! he's never fumble the football and i hope he never does !
6415,hey there how often do you watch the nfl ? you watched on tv or do you go to games
6416,"both . i go to games occasionally . not as often as snoop dog , but i go"
6417,haha i agree with you . i do go to games but it's very rare . i mostly watched them on tv . did you know that the average nfl game only lasts about 11 minutes if you are counting the live gameplay ? that seems so short
6418,whoa . i want a refund . but these days even a high school stadium cost 60 million bucks . . so im not holding my breath
6419,"yep i wouldn't hold my breath i there haha . do you know any engineers btw ? apparently an engineer will make more , over his or her lifetime , then an nfl player . that's because nfl players get injured and definitely don't work their entire lives"
6420,"plus , there isn't risk of injury like there is in football . perhaps the engineers can tweak those chips embedded in the players uniforms to measure brain injuries"
6421,"that's a good point ! i wish that all those brain injuries weren't the case , but it is good that they use those tracking chips to measure things like speed and acceleration of the players . i just hope that they take those off after they leave so that they're not tracked in their normal lives"
6422,yeah . . . dont want the wife to know where ur going .
6423,"haha that's a good point . did you hear about the new orleans saints cheerleaders though ? definitely a weird thing in my opinion , how they have to leave restaurants if players are there"
6424,i wonder if they got chips in them too . then they can be warned before entering the restaurant
6425,haha i guess they should do that . then they could be sure that the two are never in the same room . who is your favorite quarterback by the way ?
6426,well i like the way sam donald recovered from his first pass . . . but russell wilson's so versatile he could play baseball
6427,"yep that's a good point . do you baker mayfield by the way ? he was a bigtime gamer and almost went pro , but at the last minute he changed over to playing football"
6428,wow . almost as impressive as throwing a td pass to yourself
6429,"that sounds incredible ! who did that ! i want to watch a video of it . also sounding incredible , is alex smith , he actually finished his bachelor's in two years and was going for his master's before he got drafted"
6430,brad johnson did it . won a super bowl .
6431,"oh that's cool . have you ever bowled or watch bowling on tv before ? apparently top bowlers in the 60s made twice as much as top football players , there's a complete reversal"
6432,wow . alex smith should give it a try . he's smart enough to learn anything fast
6433,"yep i agree with you . i'm sure he was smart enough to use the circular huddle , by the way that was invented by a deaf quarterback !"
6434,interesting . smarter than a circular firing squad no doubt . its not rocket science but there has only been one rocket scientist coaching in the nfl
6435,that is interesting . i wonder if he's the best coach or not lol . did you ever hear about the highest scoring football game of all time by the way ? maybe that was the rocket scientist coach lol
6436,"hello there , do you watch the nfl"
6437,"hey ! yes i do . sad the season is over . i watched the super bowl , it was just ok this year . how about you ? i am actually from seattle so i love the seahawks but unfortunately they didn't live up to the hype !"
6438,"nice , yeah i watch the games sometimes . did you know women can play too ?"
6439,yeah i didn't know that was allowed to be honest . i think they are smart by not playingit is a brutal game . i think they should be qb if anything because they are the most protected .
6440,yeah i guess . would be interesting to see them in the game . i mean it only lasted for 11 minutes
6441,"true . and i hope they wouldn't do it for the money because the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than a nfl playerjust too many injuries i think . especially if there were girls , they just aren't built the same ."
6442,yeah i guess a career in engineering is a smarter choice . did you hear about that rule for the new orleans cheerleaders ?
6443,yeah i guess they don't want their players being distracted ? interesting tactic for sure . they sure are protective of their players . the nfl even puts tracking chips in shoulder pads !
6444,"yeah i hope they can use those statistics like velocity , rotation and such to improve the game and reduce concussions"
6445,yeah me too . they really need to do something . i like high scoring games but the highest ever reported football game was 2220 . i couldn't believe that . seems unsportsmanlike .
6446,i know . i bet you georgia tech still brag about that . what a game that must have been
6447,yeah i am sure . another crazy college football fact is that university of iowa's locker room for visiting teams is painted pink .
6448,"wow , that does not sound nice . did you know espn won an emmy once ?"
6449,yeah for creating that yellow first line marker ! i think they deserve it that was a great creation and changed the way the game is watched for sure .
6450,yeah that is true for sure . do you know benjarvus greenellis is ?
6451,oh yeah the patriots running back who never fumbled the football ! that is truly amazing .
6452,that is for sure . what a guy . and did you know kellan moore is the only qb that is left handed ?
6453,that's surprising . i would think there would be more . the player alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he entered college as a junior . what a smart guy .
6454,"i know , must have planned his life pretty well . good for him . do you know who invented the circular huddle ?"
6455,"very interesting . yes paul hubbard apparently because he was deaf and needed a better way to hear . and they even now use it to this day . just became a tradition i guess , funny how that works !"
6456,"i know , what a smart guy . it was really nice chatting with you ."
6457,hi are you a football fan ?
6458,"i love football , especially the nfl , how aboutyou"
6459,i'm a big fan ! out of the 32 teams in the nfl do you have a favorite ? i'm a steelers fan .
6460,"of the 32 , i would say i am a vikings fan , both our teams didn't make the playoffs this year !"
6461,nope ! lol did you know that the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink ? must have done that to mess with who they were playing .
6462,"that is true , i have seen it , i live where the stadium is ! it is to calm and relax the other team"
6463,that's interesting ! cool . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of that era . times have sure changed since then .
6464,"that is crazy , i wonder what the salary difference is now ! speaking of college teams , did you hear about the 2220 win in 1916 ?"
6465,holy smokes ! who beat the heck out of who ? lol
6466,"georgia tech beat cumberland that bad . i would have quit and walked off the field at like 1000 , lol"
6467,that's what i call a blowout ! did you know that espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line on tv ?
6468,"i did not know that , that is awesome ! i love that yellow line , i used to think it was really as a kid lol"
6469,lol here's a good stat : former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
6470,"wow , that is an incredible feat on his part . i feel all rbs do now is fumble the ball . he needs to teach a clinic or something"
6471,right ? did you know that in an average nfl game there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ? that's crazy . i hate how they don't utilize every second of the clock . especially at the end of the first half or end of a game . when i was a kid they used to throw hail marys at the end of the first half regardless of the score . now they just kneel on the ball whether they are ahead or behind .
6472,"lol that is crazy . the actual game is like 3 hours , talk about boring now ! lol , i loved hail marys"
6473,it was more exciting back then . when they would run out of bounds at any point in the game the clock would stop . now i think that rule only applies in the final 2 minutes of each half .
6474,"yea i think it does too . now they use tracking chips in players , have you heard this ?"
6475,i was reading about it . makes you wonder if they can program the chips somehow to change the flight of the ball and make it go to the chip that's in the wide receivers shoulder pads .
6476,"i bet it can , i am sure these chips are created by engineers who will make more money over their lifetime than players . it was so nice chatting with you !"
6477,i had a good time ! thanks !
6478,do you watch much football ?
6479,"hello ! yes i'm a fan to some extent , and yourself ?"
6480,i don't know as much about it as i probably should living in the the heart of football country but it does seem like a fascinating game .
6481,"ahah well it depends , do you life where football is association football , aka soccer in the us ? or are you somewhere where american football is called gridiron football or even gaelic football ?"
6482,around here it is a mix of both . it used to be all american football growing up but now soccer is kind of taking over .
6483,"ahh that's fair . i think they're both slow paced for me . although the highest american football score was somehow 2220 , which seems insane ."
6484,you would think at a certain point the other team would just forfeit the game . i mean once you reach 60 points there really is no way you are going to catch them .
6485,"oh i'm sure , i can't imagine the feeling of the other team . i wonder what's worse , losing like that or being the visiting team to university of iowa . they paint their visiting locker room pink , it seems demoralizing for sure ."
6486,that does seem like a very iowa thing to do . i wonder how many times their qb fumbled to cause that much of a run on the score .
6487,"you know who they should have had instead ? benjarvus greenellis , i hear that running back never fumbled the football his entire career ."
6488,that is quite the accomplishment . i wonder if he got any endorsements out of title like that . i can imagine there are a number of products he could do like glues or gloves .
6489,"oh yeah , i'd definitely hope he at least got some award recognition for it . i know they do care about that in football . like espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow first down line ."
6490,that seems like a strange thing to win an emmy for . i guess it was an innovation at the time though and certainly made it easier for the fans at home to see the details of the play .
6491,"oh yeah , but at least it shows there's more interest in the sport now . i don't think it would have ever happened back in the 1960s , when even the top bowlers earned more than football stars ."
6492,i think a lot of that at the time had to do with how long the career was too . a bowler can play for a much longer time than a footballer due to all those injuries they sustain .
6493,"ahh that's very fair . at the same time , i'd think individual players are more profitable in football . like quarterbacks , they can be very unique , which i'm sure earns more in endorsement opportunities ."
6494,i've always thought that the qb is overrated . i know that he calls a lot of the shots and throws but it seems like the receivers and even the defensive line do most of the work .
6495,"that's an argument to be made . sometimes i even feel quarterbacks have their mind outside of the game . baker mayfield almost didn't even go into football seriously , and thought about quitting to pursue competitive gaming instead ."
6496,competitive gaming ? is that really a thing ? how do you compete with video games ? why would you compete with video games ?
6497,"yeah i think it's interesting , on the other hand not all hobbies seem like a waste of time . like alex smith took so many ap tests in high school he entered university already as a junior ."
6498,i can respect that though . i think it is great when these players make sure they have a backup plan to fall back on because football doesn't last forever .
6499,hi there ! looking forward to chat with you !
6500,me too ! so what do you think about the eagles this season ? are you a football fan ?
6501,"football yes ; , i mean a game when players use their feet to kick the ball ; , football ; ,"
6502,what time are you a fan of ? its kind of hard to pick with all the teams in the nfl
6503,"nfl ? no , i thought you said football i like manchaster united : , red devils !"
6504,"oh , i see , i like barcelona , im a messi fan actually i think he is a great player ."
6505,"he surely is : , i'm from poland so i vote for lewandowski ! : ,"
6506,he is also a great player ! do you think lewandowski will go to real madrid at some point ? it would be a great team for him .
6507,"he might you know it's all about the money . . . he is kind of a primadonna but i guess he has a right to be one ; , he scores plenty of goals ; ,"
6508,"yeah he does , what other players from poland do you like or see having a big future ?"
6509,grzegorz krychowiak seems like the most successful but on national team he played terrible . . .
6510,"i see , didnt really followed poland on the last world cup , so howcome you dont life american football ?"
6511,"it's a good think you didn't pay attention to polish team this worldcup . . . that was just embarrassing and shameful . . . they played terrible . . . i don't know , american football is just not as much appealing to me do you like it ?"
6512,"well my favorite team didnt even make it lol , and yeah i do like it , did you know a team lost by 220 once ."
6513,is that a lot ? what is like a regular score ?
6514,"yeah that is a lot ! it would be like losing 200 in a soccer game , and regularily teams score up to 60 points and games are tight ."
6515,what ? how the heck two teams like that could even meet on the field ? totally different level . . .
6516,"yeah , that or the other team was blind , apparently both teams were at college level ."
6517,"there had to be some kind of a bet behind the scenes : , a dare or something like that ; ,"
6518,"definetely , i would retire from football after a loss like that one lol , kind of like the brazilean soccer team in the 2014 world cup , just a total humiliation ."
6519,"yeah , but that was brazil . . . kids there re being born with soccer balls stuck to their feet . . . quite a humiliation : ,"
6520,i know and in their own turf .
6521,hey did you know the nfl actually allows for female players ?
6522,"well , they should . everybody is equal ."
6523,"ya assuming that they met the requirements , i think that'd be interesting and i could see it happening for sure"
6524,"well , think about it , in high school , they opened football to both genders ."
6525,"ya , i don't personally watch sports but it is interesting , also it doesn't surprise me that on average an nfl game only has 11 minutes of actual game play , i personally think football is pretty boring"
6526,"the only sport i watch and enjoy the most is basketball . i feel football and baseball are boring . after the 7th inning , i'm yawning ."
6527,"well did you know that the new york saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the saints players ? i don't know why but that is true , the nfl is weird"
6528,"yes , i have heard about that . i wonder why . sexual harassment ?"
6529,"ya that's a good point i don't know , i read that iowa painted their visiting team's locker room pink , i wonder if that is considered harrassment"
6530,"maybe , they need to put an end to it ."
6531,were you aware that in the 60's professional bowlers made more than professional football players ? thats the complete opposite of today
6532,"i bet it is the opposite of today , as well . i feel that football players do way more than bowlers ."
6533,"yes i think so , do you ever bowl ? i used to as a kid but i don't like how your score depends on previous frames , you and your friend could both get 8 strikes but depending on the order you would have different scores"
6534,"well , i am not a bowler . i had a turkey in one sitting , but that was it . it depends whether you have spares or not , as well ."
6535,"ya one interesting thing about football though is that the huddle was created by a deaf quaterback , the circle of people blocked the other team from seeing his hand signs"
6536,imagine how much money he is making .
6537,"ya i wonder if he patented it , also that kellan moore is the only left handed quaterback that plays in the nfl , i wonder if that gives him an advantage or not"
6538,"well , i heard as a rumor , but others say that it is a fact . however , people who are left handed can get into small or large accidents ."
6539,"hmmm ya i don't know , i know that they are supposed to be more artsy , also they are more likely to be gay , but that's all i've heard about left handed people myself"
6540,"really ? well , my cousins aren't gay so those are assumptions that you have ."
6541,"yes the studies show it is more likely but that doesn't mean it is 100 percent certain of course , my aunt is left handed but not gay , wouldn't matter to me if she was or not though"
6542,do you watch football ?
6543,"hello , yes i do . what about you ?"
6544,"i do , every sunday that it is on ."
6545,did you know alex smith took so many ap classes in high school that he was a junior when he started college ?
6546,i didn't know that . he must be a very smart guy then .
6547,i think he is very smart . the circular huddle came about due to a deaf qb .
6548,"yeah , it was done to hide the hand signals . who knew ?"
6549,"yep , i would have never guessed that was the reason behind the circular huddle ."
6550,that is pretty cool . did you know there is only one lefty qb in the nfl ?
6551,i did not know that . who is the qb ?
6552,it is kellan moore . i don't know if he is any good though .
6553,very cool . i know vick was a good left back in the day before he got into trouble .
6554,"yeah , he was a great quarterback too . you have to wonder what the heck he was thinking ."
6555,not a very smart decision on his part . did you known iowa painted the opposing team locker room pink ?
6556,i did . it sounds like cheating to me . what do you think ?
6557,i think so too . in the 1960's the top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars .
6558,that is pretty cool . it reminds me of that movie kingpin with bill murray about bowlers in the 60s and 70s .
6559,haha yes ! the highest football score ever was 2220 .
6560,"yeah , cumberland got crushed . well , nice chatting with you !"
6561,it was good chatting with you too . i bet that game was super boring .
6562,"i wonder if they even there . lol . nice chat , have a good day !"
6563,"hey there , do you watch nfl ?"
6564,"hey ! not so much but i did watch the superbowl this year , what about you ?"
6565,yeah only during superbowl really . i mean it is such a long game but there is only 11 minutes of playtime .
6566,"yes that is very dissappointing , were you aware that you could actually have female players on the nfl ? there is no rule against it"
6567,"i like that rule , if you make the cut you play ."
6568,"yup , if you're good enough you can play , i don't like the rule with the saints cheerleaders though , did you hear about that ?"
6569,about them not being able to eat in the same restaurant as the nfl player ?
6570,"right , and then if they are eating in a restaurant and a player walks in , then the cheerleader has to leave , that doesnt seem fair"
6571,not fair at all . i really wonder what ths is all about though
6572,do you know about the chips that the nfl uses to track the players and football during gameplay ?
6573,i really wonder what kind of information they are collecting and it is used for ?
6574,"yes they can get the speed , location and motion of all the players and the football apparently"
6575,so cool . do you know what was the highest score in a football gamer ?
6576,"i think it was like 222 to nothing or something like that , man i would feel so demoralized at that loss haha"
6577,oh yeah for sure . and espn even won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line
6578,"yes , would you like to use a locker room that was painted pink ? i think i would get angry personally , espeically if it was in iowa haha"
6579,i would not midn it but i wonder what the reason behind it was
6580,"ya i think it was to demoralize the opposing playing team actually , it would make me angry and probably play better haha"
6581,did you know there is a player who has nevel fumbled in his nfl career ?
6582,"yes he plays for the patriots , i would give him the ball every time ! his name is benjarvus greenellis"
6583,"yeah that is interesting about him , it was nice chatting with you"
6584,hi there ! are you a football fan ?
6585,i am good how are you ? i am not a big football fan no . .
6586,"i am well . i tend to only get into it if it is near playoff time , or if my team does well . otherwise , i dont tend to follow it too much . i do like fun facts though . did you know the nfl only has one left handed quarterback ?"
6587,i watch the super bowl but only for the half time
6588,i tend to watch for the commercials . lol .
6589,yeah they are always good . i missed it this year were they good ?
6590,"i also missed it . it seems that tom brady is really cementing himself as a top qb , even though his high school jv team refused to play him . hindsight is 20 or 20"
6591,i see he is pretty popular . my friend actually was in disney after the super bowl and he was there
6592,"that would be really neat , i heard his wife actually makes more money than he does , i think she is a model or something like that ."
6593,yeah shes a huge model . she has been modeling a long time too
6594,that's pretty cool . did you know espn won an emmy for the invention of the digital yellow line first down marker
6595,i did not know that . thats hilarious ! i found the talk about the idea of female players interesting
6596,same here . i think it would be tough for a woman to break through in most positions just due to size . i certainly wouldnt want to be tackled by a 300 pound player . that would hurt .
6597,i think the size would come in their favor though as a quarter back
6598,"quite possibly , plus it is not like there is a lot of game play , usually only 11 minutes per game ."
6599,i saw that ! i think thats crazy considering how long the games take and how much people pay to see them
6600,"it really is , that means that out of the entire game less than 25 percent is actually active play , and thats just counting the time the clock runs . i think it would be a lot more interesting if there was a running clock the whole time ."
6601,they make millions though for 11 minutes of work and thats a huge flaw in our pay system in my personal opinion .
6602,i totally agree with you . although the lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than the average football player . they also have a lot longer to work because engineering doesnt beat up your body quite like football .
6603,but to me an engineer is adding to the world where as football is solely for entertainment .
6604,i totally agree . i think our priorities are severely messed up when some people cant afford to live and others live in extravagance for doing nothing .
6605,"yeah , it also is not benefiting our economy . all the money going to the wealthy means they are spending it on high end goods and it never really trickles down as it should"
6606,it never seems to work as it should . its been nice chatting but i have to get going . have a great day !
6607,are we done then ?
6608,yes . have a great day !
6609,hey there do you ever watch football games ?
6610,yes i do !
6611,ah nice what is your favorite team ? i guess there are a total of 32 to pick from
6612,mine is the eagles . who is yours out of the 32 teams ?
6613,"ah i do like the patriots myself , the superbowl was definitely slow and definteily felt like the game only had 11 mins of gameplay haha"
6614,it was definitely not a fun game to watch for sure ! maybe if that had a woman on one of those teams it would of been a better game ?
6615,"haha ya that is actually possible , i think one day we will see a female player for sure"
6616,that would be really cool ! as long as they are not saints cheerleaders
6617,"ya they have it the worst , very nonsensical they have to leave a restaurant if a player comes in , i think thats an outdated rule"
6618,"i agree . . . not fair for them at all ! i wonder if that is year round , or just during the season ?"
6619,"ya i don't know , probably all the time , scary that they have chips that can track your location and motion , hopefully they only use those on the field"
6620,hahaaaa . . that is true . . . but i am sure they have them in smart phones too !
6621,"oh i'm sure , at least it give nfl teams lots of good stats , but its scary , hopefully they don't put them on the cheerleaders !"
6622,lol ! now that would be a lot of bouncing motion in one spot . . . probably hard to get good data on that !
6623,"haha thats a good point ! do you like the quarterback kellan moore , is he good ?"
6624,"don't remember him that much . . . but i do know he is left handed , because i am left handed too ."
6625,"oh interesting , and ya do you know if that gives hiim any benefits ? like do they have to run plays against him differently ?"
6626,"probably , because he can move in the opposite direction and throw better that way unlike a right hander ."
6627,"ya thats a good point , do you liek baker mayfield ? he was almost a pro gamer"
6628,oh really ? that's crazy . . . probably a longer career if he chose that ?
6629,"haha could be , he was very dominant at halo 3 , i was good i would have liked to play him haha"
6630,hey do you like football ?
6631,"hi ! i love football . in fact , the quarterback is my favorite position because he touches the ball on nearly every single offensive play and he's the leader of the offense . what about you ?"
6632,yeah same here ! do you have a favorite player ?
6633,i always loved benjarvus greenellis and one of the reasons why is because he never fumbled the football in his entire pro career . that takes serious talent and skill . what about you ?
6634,haha it definitely is . my favorite player is tom brady . he is just too good .
6635,indeed he is ! what's sad is his old jv high team refused to start him despite never winning a game or scoring a touchdown . i bet the school still kicks themselves to this day for that mistake .
6636,i know ! he went to my alma mater too so i have extra reason to like him .
6637,"i heard that ! ha ! i also like kellan moore due in large part to him being the only left handed qb in the entire league . that's kind of hard to believe , isn't it ?"
6638,wow that is super unique . did you know women can technically play in the nfl ?
6639,"yes they can as long as they meet the eligibility requirements . i'm quite surprised we haven't seen a female player drafted yet , honestly ! i mean , with the average nfl game only consisting of 11 minutes of live gameplay , you'd think a woman could handle that , right ?"
6640,yeah i agree ! did you know iowa paints their visitor locker rooms pink ?
6641,"i heard about that . you know , cumberland was beaten so bad by georgia tech in 1916 , 2220 , which was the highest score ever in a football game , maybe they should have had a pink lockerroom for extra motivation . ha !"
6642,wow that is some score . it's strange that the average nfl player isn't paid too much .
6643,"agreed . what's even crazier is , back in the 1960s , the top bowlers actually made more than the top football players . that's depressing considering how rough football is compared to how easy bowling is ."
6644,right . you're taking so many hits and all the concussion information too recently makes it startling . have you ever played football ?
6645,"so true . but the nfl is using tracking chips they stick in the players' shoulder pads to record their every move so hopefully it can help on some way to study how to prevent concussions , maybe !"
6646,i agree . hopefully it makes a difference . did you know alex smith took a ton of ap tests in high school that he was considered a junior in college .
6647,"that is amazing ! he must truly be a genius ! speaking of geniuses , i was so happy when espn won an emmy for the yellow first down line they created . it was so innovative and i couldn't watch a game without it now !"
6648,haha that was an incredible moment . have you ever been to an nfl game ?
6649,"i'd like to ! but seeing as how the regular season is only 17 weeks long from september to december , it truly flies by way too fast !"
6650,it really does . it was great talking to you man !
6651,there is a lot of buzz happening right now during the nfl preseason . have you watched the game ?
6652,"i didnt watch the game but i heard it was pretty intense , the ngl pre season will be interesting thouhg , i want to see how teams are doing"
6653,yes . andrew luck played for the first time after missing the previous year with a shoulder injury . he did pretty good
6654,"yeah that was really sad , getting injured , it must be hard for any player ,"
6655,luck was so excited to be back he was even excited to get sacked !
6656,do you have a favorite nfl team ?
6657,i like the redskins they were not one of the top 6 teams from each conference who got to advance to the playoffs last year .
6658,"i see , i thought they were going to perform better they actually didnt have a bad team , and what about the superbowl final did you have a favorite team for the game ?"
6659,i am always for anyone but the patriots .
6660,"yeah patriots have been winning like every game thats kind of annoying , afc conference is almost always settled ."
6661,"yes , the national football league games normally only have about 11 minutes of live gameplay . the super bowl seemed worse"
6662,"the superbowl had so many interruptions , it took forever and it was a boring game i didnt like it at all"
6663,yes . and you think that the players make a lot of money but the average engineer makes more over a lifetime .
6664,well that might be because football players carreers last about 20 years and engineers work for 40 years or even more
6665,yes . it is crazy how technology has entered the game . there are tracking chips now in the shoulder pads and footballs .
6666,"i know right , its amazing how we can tell all kinds of interesting stats thanks to those chips , technology is sure suprising"
6667,the chips track velocity ball speed and location
6668,"they do , so im guessing you know who tom brady is"
6669,yes he is a well known quarterback for the patriots and throws a lot of passes .
6670,"the same one , so he studied in junipero sierra high school and played the qb position as well , although the coach thought he was bad and kept him on the bench , the team lost so many games , it was terrible"
6671,yes . did you know there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
6672,hi how are you ? when was the last time you had a chat about football ?
6673,right after the super bowl . what about you ?
6674,i have been chatting about football pretty frequently . lol i did not see the sb this year . did you like it ?
6675,i did see it . it was a slow game .
6676,i heard the previous one was better . a big comeback at the end . who were you rooting for this year ?
6677,neither team . my team is the redskins .
6678,"oh , is that the team with alex smith ? is he still playing in the nfl ?"
6679,i'm not sure . i don't follow it that closely after they start sucking .
6680,lol . that is funny . i used to follow the 49ers back in the day . and now i dont really follow them .
6681,"yeah , i was a 49er fan when i was young ."
6682,there were great . really a fun team to watch . i liked joe montana and steve young . lots of great players and the coach was a stand up guy .
6683,"yeah , montana was good . did you know the nfl uses chips in the shoulder pads of players ?"
6684,"that is an interesting innovation . i figure that it could help with strategy , but maybe with research on injuries ."
6685,"probably for strategy , the balls have chips too ."
6686,"yeah , that is true . maybe it helps to understand the relative position of the ball when injuries occur ? i dont know ."
6687,"yeah , somehow i think it is mostly for strategy ."
6688,"yeah , i bet the coaches want to know how the players are moving ."
6689,that's probably true . did you know kellan moore is the only lefty in the game ?
6690,that seems odd . why only one ? do coaches dislike lefties ?
6691,"it might be easier to set the offense up with righties . anyways , nice chatting with you !"
6692,that is true . thanks for the chat ! good night !
6693,"you too , have a good evening !"
6694,do you like the nfl ?
6695,yes i do . do you like brady ?
6696,for sure i do . did you know he was a backup qb in high school
6697,yes and he was never started even though the team did pretty bad
6698,yeah . do you like alex smith ?
6699,"i sure do , the guy is all brains as well , finished college in two years"
6700,yeah he took lots of ap tests in high school
6701,yeah . do you know who invented the circular huddle ?
6702,yes that was paul hubbard who was a deaf qb
6703,yeah and he invented that so others did not understand what he was signing
6704,yeah . do you like baker mayfield ?
6705,yes he is good and he considered leaving football to become a gamer
6706,yes and he says that he is really good at halo 3
6707,yes he says he can beat anyone in it at u of oklahoma
6708,yeah . did you know women can play in the nfl ?
6709,yes there is not rule against them playing as well
6710,yes as long as they meet the requirement they are good to go
6711,yeah . the average gamplay is only 11 minutes
6712,yeah and yet we are glued to the tv for hours
6713,true . engineers make more than the football players over the lifetime
6714,i guess that makes sense since they have longer careers too . nice chat
6715,do you like football ?
6716,i don't mind it . i think it is a very violent sport but it can be fun to watch . what about you ?
6717,"i mean for a game with only a dozen or so minutes or real gameplay , there is so much excitement"
6718,it does seem like a lot of the game is them in a huddle or standing on the line waiting for the brief bursts of actions .
6719,how familiar are you with the nfl ?
6720,i know a little about them . it seems to have the teams divided geographically and then the winning ones play each other at the end of the season right ?
6721,pretty much . the nfl's average season is 17 weeks with each teams playing 16 games by the first week
6722,oh wow i would have thought it was a longer season than that . i guess there is a lot of preseason stuff that is televised .
6723,true . it is usually from september to december
6724,very cool . i like that the league seems to be doing more about the concussion injuries that the players sustain .
6725,true . perhaps the tracking chips nfl embed in player's shoulder pads to gather data are helping
6726,i like that they are using the data in a good way . it seems like concussion injuries can really ruin a player's life .
6727,early retirement is probably why the average lifetime earnings of engineers are higher than that of the average player
6728,i could see that . i would rather have engineers well paid though because building safety trumps entertainment any day .
6729,is there any team or position you follow ?
6730,i enjoy watching the packers play . anyone who plays in an outdoor stadium in this kind of weather gets my support .
6731,personally i like the patriots who are like the lannister's of football
6732,they do seem to be quite the hated team . i always thought of them as more of the yankees of football than anything .
6733,"well if your team wins so consistently , there will always be admirers or haters . take your pick"
6734,so true . if they are a winning team and not doing anything underhanded then it is just people being jealous .
6735,"in any case , thanks for chatting ."
6736,"hi there , do you watch football ?"
6737,"hello ! i do to some extent , i think aspects of it are very interesting . what about you ?"
6738,yes me too not a fan but watch the games sometimes . did you know they only last 11 minutes ?
6739,that's a reason i don't love it ! it's very slow paced . on the other hand it's shocking the highest score ever in a game was 2220 !
6740,"yeah , i bet you georgia tech still brags about that win"
6741,"as they should ! that's one way it should be ok to taunt the other team . on the other hand , university of iowa's football team has the visiting locker room painted pink , i don't know how great that is ."
6742,yeah not sure of their intentions there . did you know women can play in the nfl ?
6743,"i didn't know that ! i always assumed they weren't allowed because if saints cheerleaders are at a restaurant and a football player comes in later , the cheerleaders have to leave ."
6744,"i honestly fin that rule really messed up , it is too out of touch with nowadays"
6745,"it's definitely a very strange rule . especially considering how modern the league tries to be , they even have tracking chips in shoulder pads to record player movements ."
6746,yeah so it does not make any sense . do you know the qb alex smith ?
6747,"i haven't heard of him ! i rarely follow individual quarterbacks like that , is there something very interesting about him ?"
6748,"yeah , he was super smart and took lots of ap tests and then was done with college in 2 years"
6749,"oh wow , that's some accomplishment . some athletes are just very talented outside of their sport . i heard baker mayfield considered quitting football to pursue full time competitive gaming ."
6750,yeah and he says that he is so good that he can beat anyone at u of oklahoma on halo 3
6751,"on the other hand some quarterbacks just get an advantage from their play style . like kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback , i'm sure that helps him a lot ."
6752,yeah probably . do you know who invented the circular huddle ?
6753,"i believe it was paul d . hubbard ! he was actually a deaf quarterback , which is why it must have been so necessary ."
6754,"yeah , that was a genius move on his behalf to use to his advantage too"
6755,did you know tom brady actually played for a terrible team in high school ? they went a season without scoring a single touchdown !
6756,yeah and look how far he has come . nice chatting with you
6757,"do you watch the nfl much ? i watch on occasion , usually during the playoffs and the super bowl"
6758,yes i watch nfl games . you know i really like espn's superimposed yellow line representing the first down line . did you know they won an emmy for the creation of it .
6759,"it definitely helps the viewers keep up with where the ball is . without it , i'm not sure if i would have figured out how the game works . i think it deserves the emmy"
6760,so what did you think about the super bowl game this year ?
6761,i think it would have been a much better game to watch had other teams been the ones playing . but there's not much that can be done with the playoffs being a singleelimination tournament
6762,well the super bowl was pretty slow . it made me believe the statistic that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
6763,"the longest 11 minutes of gameplay of the 17 week season ! i wonder if the game would have been any better if there were women in the nfl . if they met the eligibility , it would mix things up a bit ."
6764,"well the nfl has no written rule against female players , so it could happen . i don't believe a woman has ever played in an nfl game , right ?"
6765,"she would be famous if she had , right ? what if she played for the saints ? their cheerleaders can't eat in the same place as an nfl player . would a cheerleader still have to leave if a woman nfl player walked into the same restaurant ?"
6766,i would assume that all rules would apply regardless of her gender . i think this cheerleading rule of leaving a restaurant is ridiculous .
6767,"most ridiculous rules like that have a story or reason behind them , but it's likely been so long that no current player knows the reason why . i know they use chips in the shoulder pads and footballs , but how long have they been using those ?"
6768,i am not sure . another fact that is ridiculous to me is that a lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player .
6769,engineers are very smart and contribute a lot to the economy and society . and they work much longer . i wonder what the average nfl player makes compared to the quarterback though
6770,"i am not sure about their income . i know some make millions . in the 1960's , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . man how the times have changed ."
6771,it's likely television has changed that one . do you know which team kellan moore plays for ? he's the only lefty qb in the nfl
6772,"not sure which team he plays for , but i do know that former patriots rb benjarvus green ellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career ."
6773,"that fact is only impressive if he played for several seasons , which it sounds like he did . i don't pay close attention to individual players"
6774,same here . i know football facts mostly from watching videos . i think their history is quite interesting . did you know that the highest score ever in a football game was in 1916 the score was 2220 . georgia tech defeated cumberland .
6775,"at some point , cumberland must have given up , because that's a very large loss"
6776,i am sure they did give up .
6777,most of the audience at that game probably left too . they didn't have their phones to distract them from the blowout of a game
6778,good morning ! do you like or watch football ?
6779,"i watch a little , but i am not a super fan or anything . 11 minutes of action for 3 hours of watching is not my style ."
6780,i've heard that about the 11 minutes of live play . when you watch the game it just doesn't seem like it though .
6781,true there is so much hype and celebration during the game . those are times i use at home to refill my snacks
6782,i like the celebrations myself . it adds emotion to the game . have you heard about women playing ?
6783,"i know that they are allowed , but we have yet to see one break through . i think it would be cool though ."
6784,i think so too . i wonder if any women have tried . i know some play on the lower levels like college and high school .
6785,i was talking with someone who was saying there is one who is going to be at a college next year playing . i think that is pretty cool . its a tough sport for sure .
6786,yes it is . have you heard of the saint's rules for it's cheerleaders ?
6787,"yeah , that might discourage any potential female players . that seems so unfair ."
6788,it does to me too . i think if you are worried about them getting together then make the rule that whoever comes in last has to leave regardless of whether it's the player or not .
6789,yeah . very true . or just let adults be . . . adults
6790,"say , kind of along the same lines of control and tracking . have you heard about the tracking chips on the players during games ?"
6791,yeah . id like to see some of that data . i bet it is fascinating !
6792,i bet it would be too . do you think that the teams and coaches get to see all of it ?
6793,"i hope so , i also heard through the grapevine that it is sometimes used to make pads and helmets better ."
6794,that would make sense . they really need helmet improvements .
6795,"for sure , too many concussions and things that really hurt players later down the line"
6796,yes they do . quarterbacks get hurt a lot . have you heard of alex smith ?
6797,"yeah , he was the one who stayed in school to work on a masters . really smart guy ."
6798,"i totally agree . very impressive of him . i mean he's obviously smart and was the first overall pick in the 2005 draft . well , it looks like i've got to go now . it's been nice chatting with you ! have a great day !"
6799,are you planning on watching the nfl games today ?
6800,"i am . i can't believe it's time for the playoffs already , the 17 week season went by quickly !"
6801,yeah it always seem to go by so fast . did you know espn won an emmy when they started using the yellow line for the first down marker when showing games ?
6802,that's pretty cool ! the first playoff game was way back in 1932 .
6803,holy cow that is so long ago i didn't know that . i wonder what condition the field was in that year .
6804,it was apparently inside chicago stadium on an 80 yard long dirt field .
6805,yeah i can see that dirt field being a bit rough . i guess the top pro bowlers in the 60's earned more than pro football players .
6806,"i wouldn't have guess that . but also surprisingly , the highest paid dept of defense employees are the football coaches !"
6807,that is interesting . who is your favorite quarterback of all time ?
6808,"i don't think i have one , but brad johnson is the only qb to throw a touchdown pass to himself !"
6809,i wonder if that record will ever be broken . i guess baker mayfield claims to be good at halo 3 .
6810,"that's neat . i didn't realize out of the 25 largest stadiums in the world , 14 of them are american college football stadiums ."
6811,"interesting , and that is the world too , i guess americans do everything big . i always say team sports is about the team , but the quarterback is the most important player on a football team ."
6812,"that's true . he touches the ball on almost every offensive play and usually calls the plays , too ."
6813,yep that is why he is so important . did you know the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback ?
6814,"makes sense , so the other team couldn't see his hand signals ."
6815,"exactly , good call ! so who do you think will win the super bowl this year ?"
6816,"i'm hoping the eagles will somehow make it in again . the superbowl will be here soon , the first sunday in february is coming fast !"
6817,"i hope the chiefs will make it , i'm a packer fan but think mahomes is a great quarterback ."
6818,"i will enjoy watching no matter who's in it . it's amazing to watch the game with all the modern technology , camera angles and tracking chips that give a lot of info during the game ."
6819,"i agree i will be watching this year like always . well it was nice talking with you today , i hope you have a nice day ."
6820,"i really enjoy watching football , did you know that there are a total of 32 teams in the nfl ?"
6821,ya the nfl is very interesting . did you know an average game only has 11 minutes of gameplay ?
6822,"that's so short ! the rest of the time is taken over by advertisements probably , anything else you can think of for why the games take up an entire afternoon or evening ?"
6823,"well it may be because there a lot of planning , organizing , and breaks in between ."
6824,that's true and strategizing . the huddle was actually created by a deaf quarterback so the other team could not read his hand signlas !
6825,"i didn't know that . speaking of interesting facts , did you know that there are chips embedded in the shoulder pads of nfl players to track player movements ."
6826,oh really ? what do they use the tracked data for ?
6827,"primarily to make better plays by better understanding players and situations . they also put the chips in the footballs to track factors like velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location ."
6828,that's pretty neat ! i wonder if the players ever use that data to negotiate better contracts or something . or whether the reason why the university of iowa's locker room is painted is a cause of misused data
6829,"in regards to football , what position do you find to be most interesting ?"
6830,"great question ! definitely the quarterback because they are like the leaders on the field and direct the game , what position do you think ?"
6831,"i also agree on the quarterback since like you said , they do lead the offensive play . any quarterbacks you are interested in ?"
6832,"tom brady , he is a great athlete in my opinion , but there's also only one lefthanded quarterback in the nfl , kellan moore . i wonder if the plays are adjusted because of that"
6833,i think that it would be relatively similar . i think baker mayfield is also a great athlete .
6834,what position does he play and why do you think he is a great athlete ?
6835,baker mayfield plays quarterback for university of oklahoma . i just think he has had a stellar record so far .
6836,"oh wow , you think he will be going to be playing for the nfl ? i think he also takes great pride in being a great video gamer as well , which is a fun fact"
6837,i also recently read that he is quite good at halo 3 .
6838,"that's a fun game , maybe it's a great destressing technique . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than an nfl player , i find it very hard to believe , it seems like those contracts are worth hundreds of millions of dollars"
6839,"like you said games are a good way for nfl players to destress considering how much stress they put on their body mentally and physically . it is most likely the star players get a ton , but on average its well average ."
6840,"yeah , seems like a very tough and demanding job , physically and mentally . former patriots running back ellis has never fumbled a football in his entire career , i wonder if anyone else has a close stat to his ."
6841,"that is an amazing feat , making ellis a very reliable running back you can count on , especially for the patriots during his time with them ."
6842,"yeah , the patriots sure do a great job of recruiting the underdogs and turning them into stars"
6843,i concur . in any case it was nice to chat . have a nice day .
6844,hi how are you ? do you follow football much ?
6845,hi . yes i follow the nfl mainly . there is no written rule against females playing ! do you think one ever will ?
6846,i cant imagine it . i don't think women aret big enough to take a hit . maybe as a kicker or something . non contact position
6847,yeah wide receiver if she is fast enough . i wonder if a woman would move different than a man . they track movements by putting chips in the shoulder pads .
6848,"yeah , different shoulderhips ratio . the movement would be different . it would be interesting to study ."
6849,for sure i would like to know . the average lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than the average nfl player !
6850,the engineers dont have to deal with concussions either . that is a big plus .
6851,so true ! hopefully the nfl will improve that aspect of the game with all the tracking they are doing . the movie concussion was very insightful .
6852,"i havent seen it . my guess is that cte is a problem at every level , from high school on up ."
6853,yes true . hard to believe there are so many hits with only 11 minutes of actual gameplay .
6854,that means i could watch the highlights and get enough of the game . the tickets are too expensive anyway
6855,so true . footballers didn't always make as much . back in 1960 bowlers made more !
6856,"the bowlers were enjoying a golden age then . probably lots of people enjoyed the sport . now , not so much"
6857,yes not really much anymore . the highest score in a football game was 2220 ! can you believe it ?
6858,i think that the winning coach should be ashamed . what is the point of that kind of beating ? seems pointless .
6859,yes it is bad sportsmanship no doubt about that . cumberland must have been so dejected .
6860,"yeah , they should not have scheduled a game against the mighty gt . strange choice ."
6861,agreed . but that was back in 1916 and times have changed since then .
6862,maybe those tracking chips would have helped cumberland ? or a pink locker room ? lol
6863,yeah maybe lol . iowa is very cheeky for doing that .
6864,"yeah , i wonder how well it works . anyway , great chat !"
6865,great chatting with you friend . have a good one .
6866,good evening . do you follow football ?
6867,"hey there i watch football sometimes . i never knew there were thirty two different teams though , do you watch it ?"
6868,"i watch a bit , i couldnt name all 32 but i think i could get most of them ."
6869,"apparently the teams are split between two divisions , the nfc and the afc , but i don't know which teams go in which division , do you ?"
6870,not even close . i just know they have playoffs and one team from each division plays for the super bowl .
6871,"yeah and they also have no rule against female players , so i'm just wondering when you think a female player is going to start playing for the nfl ? they could probably have a kicker or something right now"
6872,"maybe , but did you hear about how the saints treat their cheerleaders ? as a woman that isnt exactly welcoming ."
6873,"i did hear about that . i can't even eat in the same restaurant as a player , and then if the player comes in even if they are already eating , the cheerleader would have to leave . i think that's very messed up"
6874,"it really is , i wonder what prompted that worst of sexist egotistical policy ?"
6875,yeah it seems very outdated . what is not updated though is the use of tracking chips in football players . apparently they put chips in the players shoulder pads and they can tell how fast the players are running as well as their location
6876,"yeah , i think they have even used it to make pads and helmets safer to find out what their bodies do when hit . thats pretty cool ."
6877,"yeah i hope they can fix the brain damage that players are getting . also it's shocking that the average football game only has about 11 minutes of gameplay , that seems so low especially when games seem to last hours when you watch them on tv"
6878,"yeah , and there is 60 minutes of ' clock ' time . there should be far more action !"
6879,i agree with you ! also i have an engineering degree and apparently an engineer will make more over their lifetime than the average nfl player . i guess that i have that going for me lol
6880,"far less damage to the body too . i have a music ed degree , i could work 7 lifetimes and still not make that ."
6881,"lol well at least you can make good music ! and it's crazy that in a 60s bowlers would make almost twice as much as football stars , so you never know that music education majors could end up making more sometime in the future haha"
6882,"maybe , but with the current state of things in education , id be better off learning to play football . lol"
6883,haha that's true . do you know what the highest scoring football game of all time was ? apparently it was between georgia tech and cumberland and the score was 2220 lol
6884,i couldnt believe it when i first heard that i thought it had to be some fluke . but it is true .
6885,"yeah i would have given up when it was 100 to 0 lol , do you like the patriots player benjarvus greenellis ?"
6886,"yeah , when he was on the patriots he never fumbled . pretty impressive ."
6887,yeah i agree . i like the patriots a lot . do you have a favorite quarterback ? personally i like tom brady
6888,all time favorite goes to dan marino
6889,"i liked that he was in ace ventura haha . but there are other interesting quarterbacks like kellen moore . apparently he was the only lefthanded quarterback in the nfl , great talking to you by the way !"
6890,"hi , i was just reading football news this morning"
6891,oh really i actually read a interesting fact recently too . kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl
6892,"that is crazy , would you believe baker mayfiled considered quitting football to be a professional gamer ?"
6893,yeah thats crazy . he says he can beat anyone on the univesity of oklahoma on one on one halo 3 game
6894,"he could beat me for sure , i'm a terrbile gamer . did you know the reason they huddle before a play is so other teams can't read their hand signals ?"
6895,that makes sense . it was actually created by a deaf quaterback so that the other team couldn't read his hand signals
6896,"that was pretty smart , some players are pretty intelligent , ale smith earned a bachelor's in 2 years . i wish i had done that ."
6897,he also began working on his masters degree before he became the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft . that's impressive
6898,"very much so , reminds me of my high school team , set a state record for most losses in a row . . . . . . i guess that happened to another team with a season so bad they never played their backup quarterback , tom brady ."
6899,wow i bet they regret that . i think that was junipero high school . they actually never won a game or even scored a touchdown . maybe they would have if they played him right
6900,"i guess you learn as you go , bet that coach is not happy now , i would not be happy if i was a saints cheerleader , they have crazy rules ."
6901,yes they do actually . the cheerleaders can't even eat in the same restaurant as nfl football players .
6902,"that is so wierd , do you know the nfl uses tracking chips in shoulders pads to recored every move of a player , talk about getting alot of feedback on your job performance ."
6903,"yeah i've heard of that . also they are placed in footballs to track the velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location"
6904,"i guess football is serious business , do you know espn won an emmy for adding the yellow line showing where a first down is ?"
6905,wow that is interesting . i also read the other day that the nfl has no written rule against female players
6906,women can try out if they meet the qualifications . it is amazing how different football is in various contries .
6907,"yes , it is . i saw that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay"
6908,"that is short , i guess commercials add more , i wonder if any women play ' football ' in other countries since it is different , i think rugby is interesting ."
6909,"yeah they many different versions of football . rugby , soccer , and gaelic football"
6910,"i would stink at it , no matter what type i played , do you know that a patriots runningback never fumbled in his entire career ?"
6911,i did see that in 1916 georgia tech scored 222 points against defeated cumberland who scored 9
6912,"i wonder why they don't have cap on scoring , that is just ridiculous ."
6913,not sure . i saw that former patriots rb benjarvis green ellis never fumbled
6914,"hi , how are you ?"
6915,good . do you still have a ' house ' phone ?
6916,"i did up until a few months ago , what about you ?"
6917,are you a redskins fan ?
6918,"i am actually an eagles fan , so not really , but i do know a good deal about them !"
6919,they lost their qb and have done pretty poorly this year and fans are worried for sure
6920,"i understand that , smith had a terrible injury , and they lost nearly all of their games after , it started against the colts though"
6921,swearinger has been a rock for the team despite the troubles with the team though
6922,he was cut around christmas i believe !
6923,dunbar has been playing well too
6924,"he sure has , and corner is a tough position to play as well , rules cater to receivers"
6925,he had a remarkable game against the cardinals didn't he ?
6926,"he did , a passer rating of 30 is worse than throwing the ball into the ground"
6927,i am just glad the peterson is getting the ball a little bit more for washington
6928,"peterson is not what he once was , but he torched us a few weeks ago , they need to rely on him with smith out"
6929,yeah he managed only 20 yards a few games back .
6930,"it also depends on how to offensive line plays , if you have no chance , it does not matter how great you are"
6931,the qb spot is one of the more important positions on the team and needs to play well each week .
6932,"that is definitely true , that is why they went down so quickly when smith had that injury"
6933,did you know that brady sat the bench in high school
6934,"i did not , but he was not even a starter at michigan , it really shows how hard evaluation of talent is"
6935,hey do you like bowling or football more ?
6936,"oh , i cannot get into football for the life of me ! i mean , i think it's more interesting to watch on tv than bowling , but i'd much rather bowl for fun as an activity ."
6937,"haha well i agree with that , i didn't know that in the 60's the top bowlers made more than top nfl players though ."
6938,that's pretty crazy ! i think that might have something to do with how complicated filming football is because of all the angles and perspectives you need ; it probably took a while to perfect that for live tv .
6939,"that makes sense , but still an engineer will on average make more than an nfl player , if you calculate over their lifetime"
6940,"i guess that makes sense . most players have such short careers and don't really have any other skills , whereas in engineering you're valuable as long as you can remember what you learned in college ."
6941,"right that is true , also true is there is only about 11 minutes of actual game playing in an nil game on average , sounds boring haha ."
6942,"i wonder how much more time there is actually played in other football sports , like rugby or aussie rules football . the american gridiron version is pretty inefficient ."
6943,"ya i agree , i actually watched a rugby match on youtube and it actually looked really awesome , way more athletic than football"
6944,"yes , i don't think their sport revolves around one player the way gridiron football does with the quarterback , who gets all of the credit and attention ."
6945,"nope that is true , everyone talks about the quarterback like tom brady or kellan moore , who is the only quarterback that is left handed"
6946,"yes , brady was the backup quarterback on his high school jv team and never played a game in a historically bad season ! crazy !"
6947,"wow that is wild ! ya i love brady , do you know how the football huddle was created ?"
6948,apparently by a deaf quarterback so the other team couldn't see his hand signals . that's pretty resourceful !
6949,ya i like that idea ! have you heard of baker mayfield ? i guess in college he was originally going to be a competitive games
6950,"that's wild ! there is a lot of money to be made in esports , though . much less likely to end up with a concussion playing those !"
6951,haha good point ! did you hear about the weirdness with new orleans saints cheerleaders ? like the things they are and are not allowed to do ?
6952,"yes ! the fact that they can't eat in the same restaurants seems a bit archaic , but i guess it makes sense that they'd want the cheerleaders to stay away from the football players to prevent any drama from happening ."
6953,"right that is a good point , i just think it's weird that if a player walks in then the cheerleader has to get up and leave !"
6954,"yes , so much for ladies first ! maybe they should have chips embedded in their clothes for tracking purposes like the players do in their shoulder pads so they don't end up at the same places to begin with !"
6955,"haha good point ! i hope that the nfl and also our government don't put chips on us like the nfl does with players , that would be scary !"
6956,hey ! how are you ? do watch any sport ?
6957,hey ! yeah i watch football . crazy what derek carr said about the defender landing on him !
6958,what did he say ?
6959,"' i wish the guy would have just landed on me besides tear his , anterior cruciate ligament , . honestly , '"
6960,"that's funny . i guess you have to be like this in football : ,"
6961,"yeah , like richard sherman said ' ' they don't care about the rest of us getting hurt . long as the qb is safe , '"
6962,true . i've recently read that nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay . it's really surprising number for me
6963,yeah right ! crazy that kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl !
6964,i guess my friend told me that about a year ago . maybe he read it somewhere .
6965,you see russel wilson is under contract with the ny yankees ?
6966,i was sure he has the future in seattle
6967,of course ! i wonder if the nfl will ever extend the season to more than 16 games in 17 weeks ?
6968,"in my opinion , it makes sense . so much fun and just 17 weeks . why not to make at least 6 months ? lol"
6969,hahaaaa . . . that would be cool ! love how they have tracking chips in shoulder pads and footballs !
6970,it gives really a lot of data . i guess now game is like computer game . . .
6971,it would definitely give advantages to coaches !
6972,absolutely ! i'm sure thay need a good software to make all conclusions .
6973,yup ! must be nice to have a famous father like snoop dog to write a fight songe for your high school !
6974,it would be fun .
6975,wow . . 1100 pound american flag . . . that's awesome !
6976,"ok , i need to go to actually meet a friend . it was my pleasure to talk with you . have a great day !"
6977,you too . . . go football !
6978,do you follow the nfl at all ?
6979,"i definitely do , i watch the games on tv every weekend . i follow the patriots . did you know that tom brady is a 4x superbowl champion ?"
6980,he is the goat . the ravens are doing well late with the rookie qb
6981,"haha goat . . . kind of interesting that quarterbacks are the glue or key to the sport . without them , teams won't be able to score . they are considered the leaders of the offensive team . also they get paid a lot . . ."
6982,"a lot of attention is being paid to the line of baltimore as the key to their success as of late , but is it enough in time is the question ?"
6983,i think so . i hope they win against the chargers .
6984,mayfield is another one that is getting attention but i am not convinced quite yet of his true talent
6985,"well , hopefully lamar jackson will be able to pull his weight as the rookie qb ."
6986,i will be rooting for him next year though i am not a big harbaugh fan
6987,no one is a big dolphins fan . i'm surprised they even get paid . at least an engineer gets paid more in their lifetime than an nfl player .
6988,true . they should give the money back . luck seems to be a rock in indy once again .
6989,"for 11 minutes of live gameplay , their hourly rate is high though ."
6990,yeah i always feel unfufilled after each game
6991,just imagine getting paid a million dollar for 5 hours of game play .
6992,"back in the day , bowlers made more than nfl players"
6993,"bowling is a dying sport , the cost to train for bowling is high . if bowlers train as much as nfl players , i wonder if they can get 900 games everyday ."
6994,probably not but do you think we will ever see a game where a football team scores 222 points ?
6995,"maybe with enough training by an entire team , and constantly drinking protein shakes . maybe having everyone as lefthanded will throw the other team's game off ."
6996,we need more superimposed graphics like the first down line that espn created
6997,did you know that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
6998,i thought tebow was left handed too ?
6999,i don't think so . maybe they just need more cheerleaders . hot cheerleaders .
7000,the nfl should be ashamed given their stance on violence towards women for still objectifying them . its hypocritical .
7001,are you a football fan ?
7002,"can't say thaat i am actually , but did you know that kellan moore is the only left handed person playing quarterback in teh nfl"
7003,no kidding ? who does he play for ?
7004,"ah i think it's the dallas cowboys , do you know how the circular huddle was invented ?"
7005,"let me guess , somebody was sick and tired of the old , trapazoidal shaped huddles ? lol . i would imagine it had something to do with hiding signal calling . what is the real story ?"
7006,"haha well from what i know i think it was a deaf quarterback , and ya he did it so that other people couldn't read his hand signs"
7007,i could see coach belichick of th epatriots hiring sign language experts to decipher the next play call . football is a complex game these days . the nfl even puts tracking chips in the ball and other equipment to gain info .
7008,"that is wild , i'm just glad that they don't do that to civilians , did you hear about the famous quarterback who almost becaem a professional gamer ?"
7009,"no , but it makes sense . these guys are compettitive by nature . i shouldn''t restrict this discussion to just ' guys ' since nfl does not have a rule against femaleplayers . women can be competitive too ."
7010,"ya i want to see that , i could see that happening in our lifetime , the guy was baker mayfield he was amazing at halo 3 btw"
7011,cool . there is more action during a game of halo 3 than in the average football game . a typical 3hour game only has about 11 minutes of actual gameplay . maybe baker want a little more action . . .
7012,"haha that is frunny , i agree with that though i think football is boring , even crazier is that an enginner will make on average more than a nfl player over their lifetime"
7013,"yeah , but the average engineer wouold give it all up for just one day as a qb in the nfl . that is unless he prefers to dine with the new orleans cheerleaders , who are prevented from even dining in the same restaurant as football players ."
7014,"haha ya that is so weird , such a crazy rule , also crazy that espn won an emmy for the yellow line in football games , like it seems so obvious"
7015,"they were probably up against two closed caption transcriptionists , and one jingle writer . they were a shoein . . what impressed me was learning that the univ of iowa school painted the visitors locker room pink ."
7016,"haha ya i know right , like i would get mad and probably play better if i were in a pink room cuz i'd be so mad , but thats me haha , do you like the patriots ?"
7017,"i grew up near buffalo , ny . hatred for patriots is in the gene . you ? i would have loved to have seen the patriots lose another superbowl , only this time by a margin bigger than the 2220 score in the georgia tech or cumberland recordsetting game ."
7018,"haha , well i for one love the patriots and was super happy that they won again ! i like how benjarvus has never fumbled a ball in his career , i would always give it to that guy !"
7019,"patriots are a talented team , and coach b has done a great job keeping them on top . i just would like to see something new at the superbowl . and i don't think the nfl players these days are worth the money they are paid . i would vote that we go back to the way it was in the 1960s , when bowlers made more than football players . but that is just me ."
7020,"haha that is true , i would agree with you on that , i know my dad appreciates the old days of football when local people played for local teams , so the city actually meant something , now players are for any team , and the cities mean nothing really"
7021,"yeah . are you familiar with the tx aandm 12thman story ? one game , the team ran out of players so a student came out of the audience and volunteered and played the game that day for the team . pretty wild really . well , nice chatting with you !"
7022,"hello , do you watch football ?"
7023,"i do like football my favorite team are the packers although i dont always agree with the moves they make concerning players , what about you ?"
7024,i do watch it sometimes not a lot though . did you know that females are allowed to play football in the nfl ?
7025,"i did not know that although i did hear the saints have an unfair rule against cheerleaders ,"
7026,"yeah i read that too , that is pretty messed up that the cheerleaders can eat at the same restaurants as the players ."
7027,"yeah , i feel pretty disgusted because of that rule , cheerleaders should sue the team , come together and make them abolish the rule ."
7028,"yeah , that would be good for them . i hear the nfl uses tracking chips to track movements ."
7029,"yes i heard about that too , they are embedded in the players shoulders and the football also has a tracking chip ."
7030,that is pretty awesome . great use of technology .
7031,"i agree , that kind of stats werent available back in 1916 when georgia tech defeated the team of cumberland by 222 points ."
7032,"that is pretty crazy ! just like the average game play of a game is only 11 min , usually the whole thing last like 3 hours lol"
7033,"i know lol , that fact doesnt look accurate , the last game i saw , the superbowl , was extremely long , more than 11 minutes for sure"
7034,"well i think they mean the actual game play is only 11 min . in football , they use a lot of time outs and breaks , for these things they stop the game play clock . they only resume it for actual game play ."
7035,"i guess i will pay more attention to gameplay from now on , there is only one lefted handed quarterback in the nfl"
7036,yeah thats a weird fact . i hear the university of iowa s opposing team lockers are painted pink lol
7037,"i wonder what effects that had on the opposing teams , i would get really pissed off at the other team because of that ."
7038,"some kind of tactic i think , i think it is suppose to soften them or something lol"
7039,that could have an opposite effect as well lol . do you know who brady is ?
7040,tom brady ? yes . i think he plays for the patriots .
7041,"yeah tom brady the same one , so apparently he also played for his highschool team but the coached benched him the entire season , the team lost so many games"
7042,haha thats hilarious ! well its been good chatting !
7043,"hi there , do you watch football ?"
7044,i sometimes watch . it can be fun . what about you ?
7045,yeah me too sometimes . did you know women can play in the nfl too ?
7046,i guess they could ! i wonder what position they would play . they don't have the size .
7047,maybe a kicker ? i think it would make the game more fun to mix genders in there too
7048,"i guess , but where is the feeder system ? college trains potential pros . i think we'd need something like that for women ."
7049,yeah we will have to wait and see i guess .
7050,"i would love to get paid like them , but the injuries are tough . not much career longevity ."
7051,yeah that is true and i guess that is why they make less money than engineers over their lifetime
7052,i would rather see more women in engineering that in the nfl . we need engineers .
7053,yes that is very true . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
7054,the cheerleaders ? they have rules ? ok .
7055,"yeah , they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players"
7056,that seems odd . i guess there were problems and they made a rule . hm .
7057,"maybe i just find it weird that even if they are eating and are mid meal , they have to leave . so sexist"
7058,"yeah , that rule is out of date . no need to eject cheerleaders . the tracking chips might help avoid the situation in the first place . lol ."
7059,well at least they are using them to collect lots of staff that hopefully can help in decreasing concussions too
7060,"it wouuld be good to reduce player injury . bowlers in the 60s certainly had it made . more money than pro football players , and no concussions ."
7061,yeah that is such an interesting fact actually . things have changed though a lot now . do you know what the highest score in football history is ?
7062,probably higher than the iq of the players . i guess it was a huge blowout .
7063,"yeah it was 2220 , that is insane . nice chat"
7064,do you like the redskins ?
7065,is that a nfl team ? there's so many names for all the different teams in sports that i can't keep up
7066,"yeah its an nfl team , apparently they have a great defense this season"
7067,interesting . i'm not even sure what city they're from
7068,"they are from washington , and yeah , you should keep an eye on them this coming season , they might suprise us all"
7069,are you a big football fan ? i tend to pay attention to the nfl around the playoffs
7070,"i do , i like the game , my favorite position is qb , they are the most important players in a team"
7071,"they're also responsible for calling the play in the huddle , which is a lot of responsibility for one player"
7072,"it is , they must have a great memory , do you know who tom brady is ?"
7073,i'd have to live under a rock not to know who he is with all his super bowl wins . it's the other qbs that i'm unfamiliar with
7074,"yeah lol he is a leyend well he used to be the benched qb in his high school , the coach missed of that talent"
7075,i wonder how often kellen moore played in high school . he's currently the only lefty qb in the nfl
7076,"the only one ? wow , i bet he is good too , alex smith is another good qb and also really smart"
7077,have you ever heard of brad johnson ?
7078,"no , is he another qb ?"
7079,"yes , and he's the only one in nfl history to throw a touchdown pass to himself . he won the super bowl"
7080,"thats awesome i wonder how he did that lol , mvp for sure , he threw the pass and caught it"
7081,"definitely . only two african american qbs have won the super bowl , and both beat the broncos when doing so"
7082,"i bet they were reallly talented , did you hear about the emmy espn won ?"
7083,for the first down line ? it's definitely helped viewers stay engaged in the game
7084,"i know right , great invention . the game wouldnt be the same without it ."
7085,do you think aqib talib will be able to give enough to the rams to continue to justify having him on the roster ?
7086,"probably , aqib talib is one of the best cornerbacks in the league"
7087,still ? he used to be but it seems to me like he's getting older and slower
7088,he can't be that bad if the rams wanted him to play on their defense
7089,"rams defense is so good , hopefully they can keep it up , they'll be back in the super bowl in no time ."
7090,"yea , the rams have so many pro bowls cbs already , defense is definitely not a problem"
7091,"aaron donald is crazy good , i wish they would have beaten the patriots . marcus peters is another allpro cb they have too"
7092,"yea , as long as they still have wade phillips as their defensive coordinator i like their chances"
7093,"the head coach is great too . i'm surprised the packers signed sam shields again , he seems like he's getting a little bit older and slower now ."
7094,all i know is the broncos aren't in a good position for success after the trade
7095,"no , especially with joe flacco , their super bowl odds went down . kirk cousins was a good pick up for the vikings , he'll be out of control next year"
7096,"yea , detroit is gonna have another bad year too despite having a rocket scientist as their head coach"
7097,"rocket science and football don't really mix that well , seahawks defensive elite era is over unfortunately , the legion of boom is no more ."
7098,"the browns should win some more , it's funny since 1999 ben rothlesberger has the most qb wins in their stadium"
7099,"browns are going to be good in the next few years , hopefully they keep picking well with their high draft picks . alex smith took so many ap tests that he started college as a junior , that's nuts . too bad about his leg though ."
7100,yea that sucks but hopefully smith was able to finish his masters degree
7101,"he won't need it hopefully , he's set for life with his contract"
7102,"i guess so , russell wilson also has a fallback if his nfl career ends , he has an mlb contract"
7103,"just like tom brady . it'd be hard to go from 11 minutes of play in the nfl to 18 minutes in the mlb , gotta be hard !"
7104,well they could always do broadcasting like kellan moore who was also the only left handed qb
7105,"they should , go chatting with you !"
7106,have a good one
7107,"hello , are you a fan of football ?"
7108,not really though i did go to a super bowl party . i guess the next football game i watch will be the next super bowl which should be the first sunday in february of 2020 . how about you ?
7109,"i am somewhat interested for sure . i think it can be too slow paced though , then again the highest score ever was 2220 ."
7110,"yeah , i mean , there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay in the average nfl game"
7111,"that's incredible , a lot of standing around and waiting . that's probably why engineers make more money than the average nfl player ."
7112,interest in football seems to have evolved very quickly . in the 60s top bowlers made twice as more as top football players
7113,"and now the culture has changed so much . espn even won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line to show a first down , that wouldn't have been a big deal back then ."
7114,"yeah , and the technology has progressed so much . there are tracking chips in balls and shoulder pads ."
7115,"that's very progressive , it's surprising then the lack of progressiveness in other areas . saints cheerleaders can't even eat in the same restaurants as nfl players ."
7116,"yeah , and cheerleaders have to get up and leave even if they were there first ."
7117,on the other hand the league isn't entirely sexist . there's no unwritten rule against female players .
7118,"i hope that a woman enters the nfl one day ! i haven't heard of any football players in modern times with disabilities either . but the circular huddle was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback so the other team wouldn't read his hand signals ."
7119,"that's sweet , it's nice they still kept that . a lot of people involved in football are certainly smarter than we give credit for . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he entered college as a junior ."
7120,"what do you think of baker mayfield's idea , to quit ofotball to pursue full time competitive gaming . would that have been a smart move ?"
7121,i doubt honestly ! i think he probably made a lot more money in the nfl than if he had been in competitive gaming
7122,"tom brady is certainly making a ton of money . but when he was in high school , they refused to start him even though they were having a terrible season"
7123,"wow , that's incredible . i heard his team was historically bad , did they even win a single game ?"
7124,"hmm , not sure ! and now tom brady has won the super bowl multiple times ."
7125,"on the other hand , i wonder what happened to the starting quarterback . maybe he should have switched to competitive gaming instead ."
7126,"that is funny . speaking of quarterbacks , i wonder why there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl"
7127,"it's kellan moore right ? it probably gives him an advantage , i bet players aren't used to it . anyways , it was nice chatting , have a good night ?"
7128,have a good one . the chat has gotten me a little more interested in football !
7129,i am a foot ball fan . are you ?
7130,sure . what's your favorite team ?
7131,"my favorite team is the bears . how about you ? also , are you familiar with alex smith ?"
7132,"i like the cowboys . no , who is alex smith ?"
7133,he was a qb but i'm not sure he will be back because he had a bad injury . he entered college as a junior and was working on his master's degree when drafted . smart man .
7134,that's pretty cool ! a little different than baker mayfield . he was a qb for oklahoma and considered quitting to be a professional gamer .
7135,hopefully he is still good when he retires and can start a second career that he loves .
7136,"i can't imagine him being as successful playing video games as he would be playing football , but who knows ? did you know there's only one lefthanded quarterback in the nfl right now ?"
7137,i did not . you would think there would be more but i don't recall seeing qb's throwing left handed .
7138,"yeah , me neither . did you know women are technically allowed to play football ?"
7139,i did not . i don't see a reason then why there has not been a female kicker .
7140,"i would imagine working in the nfl wouldn't be very fun for a woman , it's a pretty sexist industry . have you heard about that rule the saints have for their cheerleaders ?"
7141,i did and it sickens me . apparently cheerleaders can't eat where football players do but if they are already there and eating they have to stop eating and leave if a player enters . what is the point in that ? it's humiliating .
7142,right ? why wouldn't the football player have to leave ? maybe that's why you see an increase in female engineers and not football players !
7143,good point . did you know that engineers make more money in a lifetime than football players ?
7144,"that makes sense , since their careers last much longer . still crazy nfl players make what they make for only 11 minutes of gameplay ."
7145,that's so little . i knew they seemed to waste a lot of time during the game but i would never have thought it was that little time .
7146,"apparently , back in the 60s , bowlers made twice as much as pro football players ."
7147,what ? ! that's shocking . i never even see televised bowling games anymore . i couldn't tell you the name of one professional bowler .
7148,"yeah , i guess it's not very common . i see it every now and then on espn . anyway , this has been a good chat ."
7149,nice chatting with you as well .
7150,do you like football ?
7151,"hey , i kind of like it i don't watch it a lot or anything , just when i'm with friends what about you"
7152,i watch it casually but the super bowl this year was boring .
7153,"ya it was boring , did you know that snoop dog wrote a song for his son's football team ? haha"
7154,"wow , that is awesome . he also sponsored his high school football team too . he is a great guy ."
7155,"ya that is cool , can you believe they spent 60 million dollars to build a high school football stadium in texas ?"
7156,that is crazy . they are dedicated .
7157,"i guess , dedicated or stupid haha , seems like you could spend that money on something more important but what do i know"
7158,true . they could use that for charity .
7159,"thats true , how much do you think those huge usa flags weigh that they use at football games ?"
7160,"i don't know . however , i bet that it's tiring for those waving the flag continuously ."
7161,"haha well it weighs 1100 pounds and they cna cost up to 50k usd , i mean theyre not cheap and super heavy !"
7162,that is crazy . they got some strong arms .
7163,"what is scary to me is that they use chips to track nfl players speed and also the speed of the ball , they can get all kinds of stats from those"
7164,that is crazy ! they do not put them under the skin right ? they have it in the pads .
7165,"haha yes they put it in the uniforms or something , and ya it can track their location , speed , and direction , etc"
7166,"if someone accidentally wore the wrong uniform , then that would mess up the stats ."
7167,"haha good point , did you know that matt patricia is a rocket scientiest , he is currently coaching a team in the nfl"
7168,not a clue about matt patricia .
7169,"ya , and i guess the team he coaches has a fight song with math words like cosine , sin , and tangent"
7170,"that's geometry . well , it was nice chatting with you ."
7171,do you follow the nfl ?
7172,yeah . i like tom brady . . . . feel bad for alex smith
7173,why do you feel bad for alex smith ? and yeah tom brady is a great qb
7174,he such a smart qb . took a lot of ap test in high school . he was leading the 49er to the super bowl then gets replaced by colon k . . . even tho he was the highest rated qb in the nfl . now he got sent to dc and is injured
7175,"oh thats too bad ! i guess football is a game with a lot of injuries , some of then can end your carreer"
7176,yeah . maybe he should've been a bowler . the top bowlers used to make twice as much as football stars
7177,"thats crazy , i dont see bowlers making much money these days , did you know about the tracking chips the nfl use ?"
7178,i know about the potato chip i use while watching the nfl . are these different ?
7179,"yeah these are different lol , these are tracking chips players have in their shoulders and also a tracking chip on the football"
7180,i wonder if the saints put them on their cheerleaders . . . in order to make sure they are not in th e same restaurant as the players
7181,"anything is possible with that team , that is a lame rule , sexist and unfair"
7182,yeah . . . wonder which team will have the first female player
7183,"i bet that wont be happening anytime soon , did you ever watch benjarbus greenellis play ?"
7184,does he have anything to do with the butt fumble ?
7185,"no i dont think so , ellis is a player that never fumbled in his nfl carrer , his a former rb"
7186,must have been a patriot . beleichik hates fumbles
7187,"yeah he played for the patriots , and beleichik is a great trainer , he has a great team as well so that makes things easier"
7188,someone should try painting their locker room pink . u of iowa does this to opponents . worth a shot
7189,"i think its a great strategy , can help calming the other team but it can also backfire and get the other team pumped up"
7190,yeah . . . maybe thats what hap penned to georgia tech when they won 2220
7191,"2220 thats a close one lol , i bet the other team still has nightmares from that game"
7192,me too . take care now
7193,do you watch football ?
7194,"i have watched a few times , but i'm not a big fan anymore . i think it has gotten too politically charged ."
7195,i don't know a lot about it . i was surprised to learn that in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top football players !
7196,that is surprising . did you know that there isn't really a rule against women playing in the nfl ?
7197,that's pretty cool ! i didn't realize that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay !
7198,who knew ? ! it seems to take forever for a game to be finished when i am waiting to get a chance to watch what i want on tv !
7199,haha . exactly ! i heard the playoffs start soon . seems like the 17 week season took a long time !
7200,like i said too many politics . odell beckham has been talking too much smack about eli manning . i live in mississippi and the mannings are local legends .
7201,oh boy ! i heard that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl .
7202,"yea , there's all kinds of sports trivia . benjarvus greenellis has never funbled the football in his entire nfl career ! the nfl is a huge business with a lot at stake ."
7203,that's amazing ! the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 !
7204,i think i read somewhere recently where an engineer makes more in a lifetime than a football player . even more surprising is that there was a quarterback from the university of oklahoma who wanted to quit football to be a pro gamer !
7205,i heard he claimes to be able to beat anyone at the university of oklahoma oneonone in halo 3 .
7206,"i have never played halo , but i love call of duty . professional gamers make a lot of money . must be nice to do something you really love for a living . i guess that is how footballers feel too ."
7207,"it sounds great ! i didn't know the circular huddle used in todays american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not read his hand signals ."
7208,"if i had to pick a team for something noteworthy , it would be the saints . they are so particular about their cheerleaders that if a cheerleader is in a restaurant and an nfl player comes in , the cheerleader has to leave ."
7209,that's ridiculous . i guess football didn't always pay so well because in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars .
7210,yea it is ridiculous . i wonder how that would work if there did happen to be a woman football player ? would the cheerleaders still have to leave ?
7211,haha . good question ! i learned a lot today . thanks for chatting !
7212,"yea , i learned a lot about football today , probably more than i really want to know . maybe i'll try to store some of it in my brain in case i play trivia anytime soon !"
7213,"good plan : ,"
7214,quarterbacks must be one of the most important players on an american football team . . . right ?
7215,"i agree , after all he is the only one who participates in every offensive play , the qb does an important job indeed ."
7216,"plus , he gets to call the team to a huddle , which usually gets a tv closeup !"
7217,"yeah the qb definitely gets a lot of attention from the cameras , do you know who tom brady is ?"
7218,"not really , but i have heard the name . . . i don't know much about football . . . do you ?"
7219,"i know a bit about it , so brady is one of the best qb ever , a hall of famer and all and he didnt make it to the main team in high school , his team lost like almost every match ."
7220,wow that is inspiring ! i think the most exciting thing for me around football season is the traditional foods . . . do you have a fav football food ?
7221,"my favorite food is chicken wings for sure , are you watching the superbowl ?"
7222,"that's my favorite , too . i might watch the superbowl . i don't even know who is playing , though !"
7223,"the patriots are playing against the rams , tom brady is the qb of the patriots ,"
7224,"i just heard that the nfl uses chips to track the footballs . that's amazing it works , especially if the ball was knocked around much !"
7225,"you know the players also have chips in their shoulders , its amazing how tech advances and know we can learn cool stats from games ."
7226,"that would be a great job to work for the nfl doing statistics like that , i bet !"
7227,"football is sure full with surprises some of them unpleasant like how the saints have a sexist rule , their cheerleaders can be at the same restaurant as the players , they must leave if a player arrives , makes me so mad"
7228,that is a football rule i don't understand . that would only make sense if it was for opposing teams but it would still be incredibly rude !
7229,"it would be rude , you know its weird but an nfl game only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay ,"
7230,"the nfl sure does have lots of extra time for things like commercials , then !"
7231,"there is a lot of time indeed , did you know the patriots have a rb that never fumbled the ball , that must require crazy skills"
7232,that's incredible ! unlike baker mafield . . . he used to be quarterback but no he is a gamer and plays halo 3 .
7233,"i heard he almost became a pro gamer instead of a becoming a football player , i wonder how that decision would have worked ."
7234,"i might say it would be healthier to play football , but then i thought of the injuries . . ."
7235,"and also all the brain damage football can cause on players , a dangerous but beautiful sport indeed ."
7236,one must really have a deep love for it to continue .
7237,maybe the fame and the status is what makes many players continue and also the thirst for glory
7238,how's it going ! do you watch the nfl ? my favorite team is the seahawks !
7239,i love watching football ! mine is the steelers .
7240,oh nice . yeah i enjoy the nfl . i loved when the seahawks had the legion of boom era .
7241,oh yeah . did you know that there is only 1 left handed qb in the nfl and that is kellan moore ? i'm not familiar with him .
7242,me neither he must not be one of the popular players lol . one player i do remember is benjarvus greenellis because he never fumbled the ball !
7243,that's an incredible stat line to have . browns qb baker mayfield almost quit football to pursue a career of competitive gaming . what was he thinking ?
7244,haha must have loved video games . can make good money . but nowadays ball players make a lot . back in the 60's bowlers made more !
7245,times have sure changed since then . i wonder what the highest football score ever was ?
7246,good question . i think it was when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 . i can't imagine how that even would happen .
7247,holy smokes ! cumberland got whipped . did you know that the university of iowa's visitors locker room is painted pink ? wonder why ?
7248,haha yeah wonder what the other team must think . ya know that yellow 1st down line . . . espn won an emmy for that !
7249,nice . i like that line . it changed the way you watch football . the circular huddle that all the teams use was created by a deaf qb so he could relay the plays via his hands to the other players .
7250,oh yeah paul hubbard . i wonder why teams still continue to use it to this day ?
7251,i'm not sure . pretty interesting . the nfl has only 11 minutes of actual gameplay per game . that seems crazy for how much money they get paid .
7252,i agree that seems ridiculous and still so many injuries ! the nfl has no law against girls playing and yet no girls have yet . . . do you think they ever will ?
7253,i think at some point . . . maybe as a kicker or punter ? speaking of girls . . . the new orleans saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat at the same restaurant at the same time as an nfl player . kind of an odd rule .
7254,yeah that seems a bit unfair . shows how much trust they have in their players . . . or cheerleaders . it's also interesting how the nfl uses tracking devices in shoulder pads and helmets .
7255,that almost seems like they are taking technology a little too far for a game . although there's big money involved so i can see them wanting to fine tune the game .
7256,"yeah . they can track a lot like velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location ."
7257,interesting . it pays to be an engineer . in the long run they make more in a lifetime than the average nfl or mlb players will make in their careers .
7258,wow they really are smart ! have a good one !
7259,"hey there do you like watching football ? i don't really do that myself , i'm not a sports guy"
7260,i actually do . did you know snoop dog wrote a song for the high school team of his son ?
7261,no i didn't know that . have you heard what it sounds like ? i do know that one team painted their opposing team's locker room pink . i wonder how that worked out for them haha
7262,yeah that must not have been very pleasant . do you know who are the three most paid defense employees ?
7263,i think they're all football coaches aren't they ? that seems like a massive waste of money to me ?
7264,"yeah they are , not sure what to make of that really . do you know where is one of the largest high school stadiums ?"
7265,no i don't can you tell me ? also have you heard of the highest scoring football game of all time ? it was 222 to 0
7266,"the stadium is in allen , texas with 18000 seats and cost 60 million to build . oh who played in that game ?"
7267,"yep it was cumberland vs . georgia tech , and georgia tech won . they must have either been amazing or cumberland was horrible i'm not sure which lol"
7268,wow that is a huge difference . did you know the majority of largest football stadiums are in the us ?
7269,no i didn't know that . that's really crazy . did you know that the average nfl game only last for about 10 or 11 minutes in terms of life gameplay ? that seems solo but explains why i get really bored haha
7270,wow that is so short . did you know nowadays they put tracking ships on the players ?
7271,"i didn't know that no ? how does that work ? i do know that the new orleans saints cheerleaders have a lot of rules they have to abide by though . for instance they can't be in the same restaurant as a player , and if the player enters the restaurant then they have to leave , that seems really stupid"
7272,well the tracking chips are in there to track velocity and speed and rotation so that they can use those to make the game better . i find that rule so sexist
7273,yep i agree with you . do you know any engineers ? apparently over their lifetime they'll make more than any mlb player or nfl player for that matter
7274,i guess that makes sense because football players might make a lot but their career is short
7275,yep that's true . they just have to be smart with their money i guess . do you like any nfl quarterbacks ? for instance baker mayfield or alex smith ?
7276,"i like alex smith , heard he was super smart too as he finished college in 2 years"
7277,yep he is a genius . he was even working on his ph . d before he joined the nfl . baker mayfield was almost a fulltime video game player . he is really good at halo 3
7278,yeah heard he also has said that he can beat anyone in that game at the u of kansas
7279,yep you're right . what about the circular huddle . have you heard about how that started ? it was started by deaf quarterback
7280,do you like football ?
7281,some
7282,i don't as i get a bit bored . there is only 11 minutes of gameplay during each game .
7283,"i think that is why budweiser is a sponsor , breaks the tedium"
7284,i do like budweiser commercials . the frogs stick out to me . i am looking forward to the super bowl because i will get together with friends .
7285,"would be great if girls could pass eligibility requirements , make it more interesting"
7286,"yeah , i heard there are actually no rules against women playing . hopefully some women can play one day or even if more interest was shown in women's professional leagues , that would be great ."
7287,"i don't know much about the rules but do like to hear comments like one , ' ultimately , we have to throw the ball in order to move it ' was hilarious !"
7288,i read that but wasn't sure exactly what it meant .
7289,"yeah , kinda funny tho in football games to hear , makes it entertaining for those of us that don't care much for the game otherwise ."
7290,"ah , yeah , i see . speaking of funny things , when tom brady was in high school , his team kept losing , and they refused to start him , the backup quarterback . now he's a four time super bowl champion !"
7291,"crazy right ! lol , gotta wonder about that coach ! funny stuff ! heard too that new orleans cheerleaders can't eat in same restaurants as players ! gah !"
7292,i really wonder why that is ! sexism or something else ?
7293,"no clue , somebody complained somewhere and a rule was born ! voila ! something like who started putting tracking chips in player uniforms ? somebody had an idea !"
7294,"yes , it's amazing what technology can do these days ! i heard espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line ."
7295,"whoa ! no kidding , big stuff emmys , especially for a sports channel eh ? nice ! clever though , helps out those of us that need a little help lol !"
7296,right ! it helps me keep track of things that are going on . what do you think about the redskins ? i hear that the redskins defense has improved this year . they beat the cowboys 2017 .
7297,"oh ? well , haven't they always hated the cowboys though ? great to get a chance to beat them !"
7298,"yes , you're right ! it seems that redskins fans dislike the cowboys . the team takes their competition very seriously , it seems"
7299,"on another note of possible interest to a nonfan , i heard that iowas locker room is painted pink for the visiting football teams at the university ! how cool is that !"
7300,that is funny ! though i wonder if it's supposed to be insulting ? because don't a lot of nfl players dress in pink to show support for breast cancer ? maybe it's not such a punishment anymore !
7301,"oh ! clever thought , breast cancer indeed ! but yes , i think it is supposed to be insulting like that sheriff somewhere that makes his criminals wear pink clothes lol but you've a good thought ! a good way to change it up on them !"
7302,"ah , that is true . pink is starting to be cool though , i think !"
7303,hi ! are you a fan of football ?
7304,"good , yes i am . are you ?"
7305,"i watch from time to time , mainly during the playoffs . it seems the most exciting then ."
7306,"yeah , i feel ya . they could liven it up some if they had female players ! you know there's no nfl against them ."
7307,"yeah , with how they treat cheerleaders i doubt any woman is jumping to get to the nfl ."
7308,"i had heard about the new orleans saints cheerleader that can't eat at the same restaurant as players . that seems like discrinination , to me ."
7309,"i agree , especially that they have to leave if they are there and a player walks in ."
7310,makes you wonder if there was a specific incident that prompted a rule like that ?
7311,"it really does . i dont know what it could have been . anyway , did you realize there is really only 11 minutes of active game play in any given game ?"
7312,"i know there was alot of wasted time spent standing around and all , but wow ! that last superbowl i watched seemed like it dragged on for 3 hours !"
7313,"it did seem that way . i was following score updates online . the patriots pulled it out at the end , again ."
7314,"tom brady , he's the man . seems like he always saves them . he's one fine example of a great quarterback ."
7315,"he is , they didnt realize that early on with him though . his high school jv team wouldnt play him despite never scoring or winning ."
7316,i bet they wish that hadn't done that to him ! i was surprised to learn that there is only 1 left handed quarterback in the nfl .
7317,"same here , i wonder if it makes things harder for him , or the team . it must throw off the defense too ."
7318,"i would think it's more of an advantage once his team gets used to it . massively harder for the opposing team that's not used to it , though . did you know the huddle came about because of a deaf quarterback ?"
7319,its because he didnt want the opposing team stealing his hand signals isnt it ?
7320,"yes , it was . did you know there was a player that never fumbled a football , not even once , in his whole career ?"
7321,"let me guess , he played for the patriots ? lol"
7322,"of course , you know they are my favorite team ! benjarvus green ellis was the player and i can't even begin to fathom the pressure he must have felt to remain perfect ."
7323,probably a lot . that is one amazing record . its been great chatting ! have a nice day !
7324,hi do you watch the nfl ?
7325,i sure do . did you know women can play too ?
7326,yeah as long as they meet the requirement there is no rule to stop them
7327,yup pretty much . there are only 11 minu tes of game play in a game
7328,yeah that is true and yet we are in front of the tv for forever it seems
7329,yup pretty much . they are using tracking chips on the players in the field now
7330,yes they are collecting a bunch of info like velocity and rotation and such but not sure what for
7331,well i hope they can use them to make the game safer for the players
7332,that sounds good to me . u of iowa painted their visitor locker room pink
7333,i wonder why that is . bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s
7334,yeah things have really changed now . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
7335,i think it was 2220 but i forget who played in that game . do you know ?
7336,"yes that was is and the game was played between georgia tech who won , and cumberland"
7337,"yeah them thanks . espn won an emmy once , do you know what for ?"
7338,yes it was for the superimposed yellow line back in the day
7339,"yes and i am so grateful for that line , it has made watching the games from home much easier"
7340,true . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
7341,yes he is a former rb who never fumbled the ball in his career
7342,wow amazing talent there . do you know who kellan moore is ?
7343,yeah he is the only qb in the nfl that is left handed
7344,yeah i wonder if it gives him any advantages at all
7345,are you a fan of the nfl ?
7346,i'm not a great fan . i follow them some . how about you ?
7347,"me too , i used to a lot more years ago , but i follow them here and there . an average nfl game only has like 11 minutes of actual gameplay now"
7348,that's a lot of time watching for 11 minutes . and they say baseball moves too slow .
7349,right lol . both are moving in that direction . would you say you have a favorite team to watch of the 32 ?
7350,i am a rams fan since i grew up in southern cal . how about you ?
7351,"nice , rams almost had it this year ! i am a vikings fan , they almost had it last year ! is jared goff your favorite qb ?"
7352,i would have to say yes . i used to love fran tarkington when he was with the vikings .
7353,"for sure , he was a great quarterback back in the day . have you heard of alex smith ?"
7354,"no , who is he ?"
7355,"he is the quarterback of the redskins , or was , he had a really bad injury this year on his leg . he was very smart , he got a degree as a sophmore and then became the 1 overall pick as a qb"
7356,that is smart . interesting that they call soccer football . there may be more action in soccer but nothing ever really happens .
7357,"right lol , too much false hopes in soccer . do you follow college football ?"
7358,"not at all . i used to follow all the sports , but now it's mainly baseball . what sports do you follow the most ?"
7359,i follow football and basketball most . my favorite college team is the iowa hawkeyes . in football they paint the opponents locker room pink
7360,that's too funny .
7361,or bring your own cans of paint lol . they do it because pink has a natural calming effect if you see it . psychology 101 i think
7362,sounds right . i thought they were trying to insult them .
7363,did you ever hear about the college game with a score of 2220 ?
7364,yes . would you have just walked off the field if you were on comberland ?
7365,"i would have walked off the field when it got to like 1000 and never played again lol ! it was so nice chatting with you , enjoy your day !"
7366,"hello , how are you ? i just read the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink"
7367,wow that is strange
7368,also strange is in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . isnt that crazy ?
7369,didn't hear that one before . did you know that 14 of the world's largest stadiums belong to american college football teams ?
7370,"i did . that is crazy , i wonder why the largest stadiums go to colleges ."
7371,maybe because the state is funding so they waste money on it
7372,makes sense i guess
7373,american flags at football stadiums can weight 1100 pounds and cost 50000
7374,"yeah right , thats so much money for a flag ."
7375,"also , a high school stadium in texas seats 18 , 000 people and costs 60 million to build"
7376,crazy . did you know the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements .
7377,i wish they'd get a chance . snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his high school's football team
7378,"thats awesome , i wonder if it was rap lol former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career ."
7379,that's hard to believe ! lots of technology involved in nfl like chips in shoulder pads to record players moves .
7380,"yeah , i guess that makes sense , i wonder when they started doing that though ."
7381,"i don't know . more pressure i guess to make the right moves , but less brains and more computer brains involved"
7382,"alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a junior . the quarterback received his bachelor's degree in two years , and began working on a master's degree , before becoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft ."
7383,"smart guy and motivated ! athletes don't always get the credit for their brains . on a funny note , brad johnson is the only quarterback to throw a touchdown to himself in nfl history"
7384,"thats amazing , lol how does that even work ?"
7385,i'm wondering myself how that was legal ?
7386,"i have no clue , must have been by chance . good talking to you , have a good one ."
7387,how much do you like football ?
7388,a lot . you ?
7389,"i really enjoy it , i pretty much watch every single game that i can ."
7390,do you watch college or pro football
7391,"usually i watch the nfl , but occasionally i'll watch college ."
7392,i like pro cause it is more interesting . college football players most of them are not good . what do you think
7393,i agree . the problem i have with college is that there is just too many people to remember . i know most nfl players .
7394,i concur . do you watch other countries' football like canadian football
7395,not really . if nothing else is on i might watch it or if i'm at a bar sometimes they have it on if no other sports are on .
7396,do you think afc or nfc win this year super bowl
7397,"i want the nfc to win it , but the chiefs are a really good team and i think they would be my pick to win it all ."
7398,i strongly believe the chief will make it to the conference but not so sure about super bowl cause of their running back situation
7399,"not having their started will for sure hurt them , mahomes is a beast though . who do you think is gonna take the super bowl ."
7400,the ram cause they are pretty healthy
7401,rams and chiefs are my current picks for the super bowl . they are both amazingly powerful teams this year . seeing either one in the bowl would be nice .
7402,"yeah , both will be superbowl contending team for a while"
7403,for sure . i'm surprised at the rams last game against the bears . do you think they will have a tough time if they play them again ?
7404,"in cold weather , it is for sure . by the way , nice chatting with you"
7405,"yeah , have a good day ."
7406,bye
7407,"hi , how are you ?"
7408,"hello , im great , what do you think about the jets and their goal to land kirk cousins ."
7409,i think they should be thankful they did not land him . they got a great young qb instead . . .
7410,"i think that is a great decision , if they have a young qb then they can polish him , and i bet he wasnt as expensive as cousins ."
7411,"no , he was out of usc and rookie contracts are slotted so when he was chosen in the draft , they knew what they were going to pay him before choosing him ."
7412,"oh i see , so he was cheaper than cousins then ? do you know how much they closed him for ?"
7413,probably around 4 years and 40m . which seems like a lot but cousins got nearly 25m per year !
7414,"oh i see , hopefully the qb they picked was a great choice , you know brady wasnt picked to play with his high school football team , he was benched all the time and the team lost almost every game ."
7415,that's odd . maybe the coach saw his talent and the lack of talent the offensive line had and decided to spare him all the sacks . maybe he was protecting him . . .
7416,"who knows maybe he was or maybe he didnt know he had a future hall of famer in his rooster , are you watching the super bowl this year ?"
7417,i am . what about you ? will you watch it ?
7418,"i will watch it for sure , with friends and family what team are you rooting for ?"
7419,"i am indifferent . i root for a good game and a good storyline . if it has that , i usually don't care . although every time i say that , i find myself rooting for one team during the game . it will probably be new this year . who are you rooting for ?"
7420,"i am rooting for the patriots , i am a fan of that team its amazing how much the game has evolved , players now have chips to track their moves and the football does as well"
7421,are you from ne ? i will be using chips too . i think it will be bbq chips for the game .
7422,"yes i am , and i have been fan since i watched benjarvus green ellis play , what a great rb !"
7423,he never fumbles ! i liked him . had him in fantasy one year . i wonder where he went ?
7424,"he is retired now , has been for a few years at least ."
7425,do you think tom brady will retire if he wins on sunday ?
7426,"i think he will , its a strong possibility , i think he has won it all and should retire at a high peak ."
7427,good luck sunday . nice chatting with you !
7428,"thank you , i will be cheering for brady and the patriots for sure !"
7429,do you think jon gruden and the raiders will get better next year without mack ?
7430,"i dont know if it's really all the lack of mack that is making them lose , gruden is very new as a head coach of the raiders , maybe he hasnt found hit footing yet"
7431,"' chucky ' as he is affectionately known , could have done much better according to the critics"
7432,isn't that a weird nickname ? i dont think i would want to be known for my creppy smile .
7433,he sure looked like chucky after the loss to the jets and during the post game interview
7434,"it was a surprising loss for sure , they were leading at the half but 3"
7435,"mack has been huge for his new team , the bears"
7436,yea he killed it in his first game against green bay . the bears are lucky to have him . theyre also a team that has a struggled a lot recently
7437,maybe if carr wouldn't throw so many interceptions it would help too
7438,yea after his 3 in the 2nd half they lost their lead and ended up getting destroyed by 20 points
7439,darnold hasn't turned out to be the qb that the jets were hoping for i don't think
7440,"some quarterbacks aren't earning their salary . carr got paid 125 million , and didn't play very well ."
7441,to upset gruden and think that he is better than he actually is
7442,"out of the 32 teams in the nfl , i think the raiders are close to the bottom"
7443,gruden is fed up with his team and carr''s poor play
7444,you would think that with just 11 minutes of actual gameplay it wouldnt be that hard to coach a team to victory
7445,true . i have been rooting for gurley and goff all year and hope they give gurley the mvp award
7446,"that would be possible . he probably makes a ton of money too . which is crazy because when football started , even a pro bowler made twice as much as star football player . times have changed"
7447,i am still no fan of ndamukong suh
7448,do you like peters and talib more ?
7449,i like talib from back when he was with denver .
7450,are you interested in the ravens ?
7451,"not so much , i'm an eagles fan . are you ?"
7452,i am near foxboro s i guess i am a patriots fan . i do not follow sports that much .
7453,i can't believe it's almost time for the playoffs ! the first super bowl was at the end of the 1966 season .
7454,i remember that . i had already graduated from high school . i went through high school with no super bowls . didn't miss it much !
7455,haha . i hear ya ! did you know an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
7456,"i don't believe that but it does seem like evry time they kick the ball , they stop for a while to see what they did . i think it is a boring game ."
7457,"the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 . i find that one hard to believe , too !"
7458,cumberland must have felt like slinking off the field . i would like to hear what the coach had to say . lol
7459,"he was probably fired right after the game . in other countries , they call soccer football . i find soccer really boring ."
7460,ugh so do i . it's all too slow . i rather watch basketball .
7461,"there are some interesting football facts though . the circular huddle used in todays american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not read his hand signals ."
7462,at least he didn't have to listen to all of the fans screaming .
7463,very true ! there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl .
7464,it must be hard for him . the world is made for righthanded people .
7465,sure is . i didn't realize that bowlers made more than football players in the 60's !
7466,"bowling used to be very popular . it's boring to watch , though , but fun to play ."
7467,i haven't bowled in a long time ! i heard that new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player !
7468,i think that is a ridiculous rule . they have to get up and leave . . . what if they are eating ?
7469,very old fashioned rule !
7470,some of those old rules should be changed .
7471,i agree ! nice chatting with you !
7472,"you a football fan ? did you know the university of iowa visiting football team locker room is painted pink ? for mind games , i guess ."
7473,"hello yes , i love football . that's crazy they painted the room pink . i wonder if it worked ?"
7474,no idea . the highest ever score in a football game was 2220 in 1916 . pretty brutal .
7475,wow that's a crazy high score ! the 1960's bowlers made twice as much as top football stars .
7476,haha . how times have changed . i bet bowlers don't even make 10 percent of what footballers make now .
7477,"haha yea i have no idea what bowlers make , but i bet it's not a lot . did you know greenellis never fumbled in his entire nfl career ?"
7478,that's a pretty great accomplishment . espn won an emmy for creating the yellow first down mark on the field when you're watching games . that was a game changer for sure . hard to imagine watching games without it now .
7479,that's pretty cool . did you know there is no written rule against female players playing in the nfl ?
7480,i'd love to see a female in the league . nfl cheerleaders for the saints aren't allowed to eat at the same restaurant as the players . i guess they don't want them fraternizing .
7481,yea i think a lot of teams have rules about fraternizing with cheerleaders .
7482,i guess they like to keep track of things . like how they use chips in the players' shoulder pads to track every move on the field .
7483,that's funny they kept chips . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player ?
7484,"huh , interesting . i guess because an engineer's career lasts longer . never thought of it that way . the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . thank goodness for instant replays !"
7485,"yes , thank goodness for that . do you know much about quarterbacks ?"
7486,a fair bit . like kellan moore is the only lefthanded qb in the nfl .
7487,oh wow i didn't know that . baker mayfield almost quit football to pursue a career in professional gaming .
7488,"haha . what game did he play , do you know ? alex smith entered college as a junior because he took so many ap tests ."
7489,"i have no idea what games he played , but very funny ."
7490,"actually , i think it was halo 3 ! one of tom brady's hs teams didn't win a game or score a touchdown all season . he was on the bench the whole time ."
7491,i can't believe tom brady was never drafted . it was a gem to find for the patriots .
7492,"yeah , that's an understatement . been great talking with you !"
7493,hi how are you ?
7494,"i'm great ! hi how are you , too ?"
7495,i am doing well . are you a fan of football ?
7496,i sometimes follow it . i try to watch the super bowl . you ?
7497,yes i am a pittsburg steelers fan ! did you know theres no written rules about girls playing in the nfl ?
7498,"yeah , that sounds right . i dont think anyone ever expected women to try . do you think women will ever play ?"
7499,i doubt it . that would be impressive though . maybe as a kicker if anything !
7500,"a kicker , sure . maybe a punter . i figure that there is something ."
7501,true that . there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game on average . crazy !
7502,"yeah , a lot of standing around and waiting . i could just watch the highlights and it would be enough ."
7503,i agree ! the saints are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as their cheerleaders . so weird .
7504,these outdated attitudes should change . the cheerleaders are not the problem .
7505,totally . there is only one left handed qb in the nfl ! good for him .
7506,i wonder how often he plays . i bet it could throw off the defenses .
7507,i have no idea but that probably helps !
7508,i wonder . i think that batters in baseball have trouble with certain pitchers . i figure it must have a parallel in football .
7509,im sure there is . funny that iowas visitor locker room is painted all in pink !
7510,"does that even work ? if it did , every team would try the same stunt ."
7511,you would think . it sounds pretty dirty to me !
7512,"what is the home record of u of iowa ? i rest my case . anyway , great chat !"
7513,no idea ! nice chatting with you !
7514,have a great day !
7515,also funny how bowlers in 1960 made more than top football stars ! have a good one !
7516,"hello , do you like football ? i think the qb is the most important player on the team"
7517,"yea , a good qb like kurt cousins gives the redskins a better chance than starting mark sanchez"
7518,"he did provide stability to the team , are you a fan of the redskins ?"
7519,no but i'm a giants fans so i know a lot about their rivals . losing cousins to the vikings really hurt the redskins
7520,"i bet it did , cousins is a good player , i bet the vikings knew that , hopes he has a great carreer though"
7521,yea it's too bad smith got injured too after he ended up replacing cousins
7522,smith is one of the oldest players on the team right ?
7523,i believe so . too bad the redskins didn't try to get mayfield . he's the browns 30th starting qb
7524,"i think the patriots have the best qb on the leagye , brady is a great leader"
7525,yea brady is great . so is rivers of the chargers
7526,"yeah rivers is another player that i like , what do you think about qb like alex smith or mayfield ?"
7527,i think mayfield has a lot of potential and before his injury smith was a reliable qb
7528,"i think they are both good , you know that mayfield is also a great gamer ,"
7529,"yea , i heard he like halo . did you know russell wilson has a major league baseball contract ?"
7530,"i dont really know who he is so no comment there , is there an interesting fact behind that contract ?"
7531,"wilson is the qb for the seahawks , he used to play minor league baseball and signed a contract with the tx rangers"
7532,"oh i see , interesting , did you hear about benjarvus greenellis ?"
7533,i remember he use to play for the patriots not too long ago
7534,"yeah around 2011 , cool fact about him , he never fumbled the ball in his entire nfl carreer ! ! !"
7535,that's impressive . did you know that coach matt partricia is an actual rocket scientist ?
7536,"a rocket scientist ! ! ! wow that is impressive , he must be a really smart man ."
7537,are you a football fan ?
7538,i am a fan of the game do you like the nfl ?
7539,"i do watch on tv when my saints are playing . its not quite the same as being there , but tickets are too expensive . i like the yellow 1st down line on tv which gives a perspective of how far it is . did you know espn won an emmy for that creation ?"
7540,"so you are a fan of the saints , cool , and no , why did espn won an emmy for ?"
7541,"espn won an emmy for the yellow line overlayed on the field so when watching on tv , the viewer knows how far it is to first down . it gives a bit of perspective on what is going through the quarterback's mind . do you have a favorite quarterback ?"
7542,"i guess the yellow first down line is a big contribution to the game and yeah mine is tom brady i also like alex smith , do you have a favorite one ?"
7543,"brees , obviously . historically , i liked archie manning , but he did not have the level of success on the field that his sons had . what i did not know is that at one time , the nfl had a deaf qb , paul d . hubbard . he created the circular huddle so the opposing team could not read his hand signals !"
7544,"those sounds like great qbs im not familiarized with them , baker mayfield is another great qb and sounds like hubbard created a legacy ."
7545,i would say so considering they still use the circular huddle . i was surprised and pleased when i learned that we had a female nfl referee officiating the playoff games . do you ever think we will have female nfl players ?
7546,"i don't think so , maybe a whole other division but not in the same league as men's , i think that would be really unfair and actually scary to watch"
7547,"probably so , but perhaps a woman will try out since the league rules allow it should she meet the eligibility requirements . perhaps as a kicker since it is a lower contact position . what are your thoughs on tech in football like the tracking chips the nfl use on shoulder pads and in the ball ?"
7548,"i think that tech is taking over the game and that is great , all kinds of cool stats can be known thanks to that so i think its great , stats such as the moves of players , speed of the ball and many more ."
7549,"i also think is could be a good training aid , especially for the qb . it could let the qb know the speed and rotation of the throw ; after all the best throw is a fast tight spiral . do you follow collegiate football ?"
7550,"i do follow it , some of the time at least but mostly nfl , kind of makes me angry that games only have 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
7551,"i am having trouble figuring out where the rest of the time goes . after all , they only 20 seconds to huddle , line up , and snap the ball . i guess if the play lasts less than 20 seconds and results in a dead ball then that could be part of the reason why !"
7552,"yeah i guess so still seems like little time , games tend to last a long time and only 11 minutes is unfair to fans ."
7553,"true . i prefer to watch it live and am a season ticket holder for my alma mater , the lsu tigers . did you know that the highest scoring football game was in collegiate with georgia tech beating cumberland 2220 in 1916 ?"
7554,"2220 ! ! ! is that real ? woah , how can a team lose by that many points were they even playing the same sport lol ."
7555,what i also find interesting is some of the quirky offfield rules . like the one forbidding saints cheerleaders from eating in the same restaurant as nfl players . its unfair that they must leave even if they were there first and already eating !
7556,"that is really unfair , the nfl should ban that rule and the saints should change it not only sexist but also humiliating rule , makes me feel angry and disgusted ."
7557,it seems so immature ! like the university of iowa painting the visiting football team's locker room all pink ! is that suppose to humiliate or intimidate the opposing team ?
7558,"that is so funny , can you imagine being the opposite team and then arriving at an all pink locker room , the look in their faces just priceless anyway its been cool chatting with you today ."
7559,"thanks and same to you ! and keep your day job . after all , an engineer , or likely almost any technical professional , earns more in their lifetime career than the average nfl player !"
7560,"hello there , are you excited for the upcoming super bowl ?"
7561,"of course i am , counting the hours till sunday what team are you cheering for ?"
7562,"i think i will be cheering on the rams , but mostly for the score depending on what numbers i get in any kind of pool i'm in . how about yourself ?"
7563,"i am rooting for the patriots , are the rams your favorite team in the leage ?"
7564,"no i am a packers fan , i just think the rams had a good season and deserve it , plus the pats have won it enough recently ! how about you ?"
7565,"yeah could be , my favorite team is are the patriots but i wouldnt mind if they lose , i just want to watch a great game !"
7566,"yeah i'm the same way , i like when the game is a game still late in the 4th quarter and it takes some awesome plays to win it ."
7567,"i agree , so did you know about the tracking chips the players have ?"
7568,no i don't know too much about that . i imagine they have them in their helmets to track hits for concussion studies ?
7569,"i think they track the moves to have a better idea of the plays , location , distance runned amont others , the football also has a chip ."
7570,"yeah i think you are right , pretty sure they have them in shoulder pads as well ."
7571,you know engineers end up winning more money than football players and without all that brain damage .
7572,"yeah i think i have read that they earn more in a lifetime overall , probably because they work their whole career vs . average football players maybe 8 years ."
7573,"when you put it that way a football player does earn more , in the 60s they didnt as bowlers made more money that football players ."
7574,yeah isn't that crazy to think the top bowlers were the big ballers back in the 60's . oh man what a life to be a pro bowler in the 60's lol .
7575,"i wonder how much they actually earned lol , did you hear about the emmy espn won ?"
7576,i think i remember them winning one after they came out with the yellow line for the first down line on tv games right ?
7577,"yeah that is right , i guess it is pretty usefull and deserves an award , it did change things"
7578,"yeah it definitely is very useful to everyone watching on tv . do you know what the highest scoring game ever was , college or pro ?"
7579,"i dont know about pro , in college it was 2200 , thats a humiliating loss ."
7580,"yeah you are right ! isn't that just an insane score , you would have to score on basically every play . well nice chatting with you today , i hope you have a good day ."
7581,"hey ! it's quite interesting , but nfl has no written rules against female players . it's just difficult to believe ."
7582,isn't it ! they would have to be some tough females !
7583,"true . it says they have to meet the eligibility requirements , but i'm wondering what kind of requirements they may have ."
7584,"alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a junior . the quarterback received his bachelor's degree in two years , and began working on a master's degree , before becoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft . it would be interesting to see !"
7585,"it's amazing . i'm sure it's difficult to combine all together , but he is very talented"
7586,"this is really interesting too ! baker mayfield , quarterback , university of oklahoma , once considered quitting football to pursue fulltime competitive gaming , and claims to be able to beat anyone at the university of oklahoma oneonone in halo 3 ."
7587,i didn't know that . i guess not so many people know it .
7588,i bet he would not have made the money he is now ! i didn't know the nfl was 32 teams .
7589,quite surprise for me that the average lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earning of nfl player . i was sure they make a lot
7590,thats all you hear ! how much they make . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay
7591,it shocked me . i cannot believe . just 11 minutes ? ? ? ? ?
7592,yes ! and the average game lasts 2 . 5 to 3 hours !
7593,"honestly , i'll take a look in the internet . it's just difficult to believe ."
7594,"let me know what you find ! nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
7595,good point . nfl has a lot of data .
7596,"definition of football . football is a family of team sports that involve , to varying degrees , kicking a ball to score a goal ."
7597,it's very broad definition . soccer reflect it for sure .
7598,"yeah , i had never heard of association football ."
7599,do you watch or play sport often ?
7600,"no , not at all . you ? the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220"
7601,it was long time ago . i'm not sure it would be possible in 2019
7602,especially with only 11 minutes of actual play time !
7603,absolutely !
7604,back then they even made more money in football . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars .
7605,"i didn't know it ! well , it was my pleasure to talk with you . have a good day !"
7606,u2 ! nice talking with you !
7607,thanks .
7608,good morning to you
7609,"hello there , do you follow the nfl at all ?"
7610,"i sure do , i watch the game every sunday when its on , do you ?"
7611,"yeah i usually follow during the season , my team didn't make the playoffs this year so that was disappointing ."
7612,who is your team ?
7613,"i like the packers , do you follow a team ?"
7614,yea im a patriots fan . sorry haha
7615,"lol , well you have had one hell of a run the last 20 years or so !"
7616,"ohj yea , weve been lucky with tom brady"
7617,"yeah you sure have , the coach as well , bellicheck will go down as the best ever in my opinion ."
7618,he is pretty good ! but robert kraft ? uh oh haha hes gotten into some trouble
7619,"yeah that wasn't what i would of done with that much money , just fly to vegas for the day !"
7620,or have an escort come to your house ! cmon man
7621,"exactly , now he will be forever associated with this incident !"
7622,"ah well , it does make for kind of a funny story . did you know tom brady actually played backup qb in high school for junipero serra high school and was never started ?"
7623,"holy crap , i never knew that . i wonder what scout for college was like , hey whos that guy on the bench ?"
7624,haha right ? and what would have made him to scout brady for the colllege team ? stories like that are ironic
7625,yeah those stories are ! funny how some of the best ever start out .
7626,"i wonder when we will start to see female nfl players , theres no written rule against having them on the teams"
7627,"i think that would be so cool if one did , it would give young girls in all sports hope to make it pro ."
7628,it would . i wonder why none have hopped onto the trend yet
7629,"hi , how are you doing today ? it is certainly a fine day for a chat with new friends ."
7630,hi ! hope you're doing well ! so are you a fan of the qb position ? i am simply because he touches the ball nearly every play on offense plus calls the plays in the huddle !
7631,"the qb is the man . he runs the show , and makes things go , don't you know !"
7632,so true ! isn't crazy there's only one left handed quarterback in the nfl and that's kellan moore ?
7633,i guess there must be an issue with lefties . perhaps the offense must be run differently ? i don't know . interesting though .
7634,agreed . can you also believe the circular huddle american football uses today was invented by a deaf qb so opposing teams couldn't read his hand signals ? that was very smart of him !
7635,that was certainly very smart of him ! now everyone copies that deaf qb . a trendsetter indeed .
7636,very true ! then you've got geniuses like alex smith who entered college as a junior and earned his bachelor's in two years . that's someone i'd want on my team ! ha !
7637,he must have studied very hard and done well in his coursework . he probably had the right mind for a qb .
7638,"indeed ! but then you have qbs like baker mayfield who considered quitting football for competitive gaming . that would have been a huge mistake , in my opinion !"
7639,"i agree . the money , the glory . football much better ! much !"
7640,"so true ! i tell you , i couldn't believe tom brady's jv high team refused to start him despite never winning a game or even scoring a touchdown . that is sad and i bet they regret that since he's now a four time superbowl champ !"
7641,"he's got five now , right ? even more regret for them ! lol"
7642,no kidding ! he's a great player . i truly love the nfl but it surprised me that the average game is only 11 minutes long in terms of live gameplay . that's almost unbelievable !
7643,i think it's still a tough game . lots of injuries . short careers .
7644,"agreed . i believe the short careers is why engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players , sadly ."
7645,don't let your sons and daughters grow up to be nfl players ! it ain't worth it !
7646,"no kidding . speaking of income , did you know the top bowlers made more than top football players back in the 1960s ? that is crazy !"
7647,i think it was a golden age of bowling . the polyester pants made the bowler physique quite charming .
7648,"that is true ! but with players like benjarvus greenellis who's never fumbled the football in his entire pro career , i'd imagine he deserves more than the top bowlers these days . ha !"
7649,"yes , he does . anyway , great chat ! have a good day !"
7650,"and of course , i'm surprised the league has no female players since there's no rules forbidding them from playing as long as they meet the eligibility requirements ! well it was great chatting with you as well ! take care , friend !"
7651,"hey there , do you have a favorite quarterback or anything like that ? i like to watch tom brady a lot"
7652,"yeah , he's pretty cool . he's a favorite in his hometown of san mateo , ca . i can't believe he was passed up on when he was on the jv team of his high school . their loss !"
7653,yeah that definitely was a stupid move on their part . alex smith though maybe he missed his calling . he was a genius and got his bachelor's degree in only two years . and he was working on his master's but then was drafted into the nfl . he might have been able to do a whole lot more without doing the football thing
7654,"wow ! i know , right ? ! i wish i went off to college my junior year in high school but at the rate he was going with his ap tests , its not surprise he would skip 12 grade in high school . the fact that he could balance all of that and football is pretty amazing . he's an athletic genius : ,"
7655,i agree with you ! what do you think about kellen moore as well ? he's the only lefthanded quarterback in the league i wonder if that gives him an advantage or not ?
7656,"that says a lot , i know that lefty's are highly regarded in general . i think it could give him an advantage since most players may be right handed so he's able to really dodge the other players when passing the ball . i bet he didn't fumble the ball as much either ."
7657,"yep that's a good point . we have to do some research on that . also , i wonder if the deaf quarterback did research when he invented the circular huddle . it's such a genius thing , that i can't believe it was invented earlier"
7658,that was a pretty clever move on their part because you know the opposing team is always looking for ways to figure out their opponents next move . i wonder if they have any deaf quarterbacks now ? they would probably do better than the players that can hear because sometimes those guys don'
7659,that's a good question . i don't think that they have them in the professional weeks anyway . did you hear about how the university of iowa painted the opposing team's lockerroom pink ? that would actually make me play better i think
7660,"wow , totally emasculating to say the least lol but you're right , it would make me want to work harder at winning so that my team gets the last laugh : , do you think the locker room is still pink or was that back in the day ? i would think they would not have it that way now because everyone is so worried about being politically correct these days ."
7661,"haha you're right about that . i guarantee someone would complain about it . do you know the highest football score of all time by the way ? it was 222 to 0 , talk about a blowout lol"
7662,"yeah , i would say that team got beat down lol kinda embarrassing for the losing team . maybe that team was in the wrong division to start with . i haven't seen anything that high of score ever . i guess that was more like a practice game for georgia tech . i wonder how the cumberland team is doing now ? i'm sure their coach reminds them to not ever allow that again lol"
7663,"that's a good question . because i don't really watch college sports i don't know , hopefully they're doing better though lol i don't think they have a guy like benjarvus greenellis though he's never fumbled the ball they would have done a lot better if they had him"
7664,"oh yeah , benjarvus greenellis was the man ! at least he can always brag about not ever fumbling the ball to the grand kids . i'm sure not every football player can say the same . where is greenellis now ? did he make hall of fame ? i hope so !"
7665,"i hope so too ! i don't know that he plays anymore , but i don't really keep up with football that much now . i also think it's crazy how they use tracking chips on the players . technologies becoming so advanced now"
7666,"yes , technology has taken over so much . pretty soon they'll embed a chip in the players body which they should because some of those guys are trouble makers lol i don't follow football much but they seem to make headlines lol i also noticed how much the nfl has advanced in other technological ways with all the angles they are able to get on camera during the games and the wireless microphones that the team coaches and assistants get to wear to track their team more as well ."
7667,"yep i could see that . it's kind of scary and hopefully they can take those chips and cameras off once they leave the field . i hope that civilians never have to wear those , because you can track everything from location to speed to velocity and rotation , it's a changing world that's for sure"
7668,"its a little creepy if you think about it . but i totally agree , i hope they're able to have a little privacy once they are off the field . i noticed that women are able to play in the nfl if they pass the requirements needed to play . i don't know if i would want to play among all those sweaty big guys lol but i think its pretty cool for a women to play . i think there is one female in the nfl that i know of ? not sure though ."
7669,"no there is not a female player in the nfl yet . but there is no rule against it . i would be very interested to see one start playing though . there is no rule so it's possible , but they would have to be really good , that's for sure , and also know how to take a hit potentially"
7670,exactly ! i wonder how the male players would feel about tackling down a female the way they do their fellow male team mates . but i'm sure it wouldn't be so bad given that the game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
7671,"yep that's true . and also , would they all use the same locker room , or if there was only one girl on the team would she get her own locker room , who knows ? i just don't know how it would work but i'm sure we could figure out a way so that everyone would be happy"
7672,the nfl is one of the major sports league in north america .
7673,do you watch the nfl ?
7674,"yes . it my favourite sports , the nfl regular season starts from september to december . which is your favourite team ?"
7675,my favorite team is the baltimore ravens . what about yours ?
7676,super bowl is my favourite . nfl earn high revenue higher than other players .
7677,i would bet the quarterbacks are the highest paid team members . they tend to be the most famous players .
7678,quarterbacks are members of the offensive team and line up directly behind the offensive team .
7679,"even though they line up behind the offensive line , they are considered the team leader ."
7680,nfl uses tracking chips in the players shoulder pad to record their movement in the field . this type technology improvement make the game very effective .
7681,"i think it would be interesting to see a diagram of the recorded movement . nfl players move around a lot in a game , even with just 11 minutes of live gameplay on average ."
7682,they are using circular huddle pad to avoid other team players watch the sign in the field . this type of tactics are very important and make the game very interesting .
7683,"football requires a lot of strategic skill and tactics to play successful plays , since neither team knows what the other will do ."
7684,"in october 1916 , the game held between georgia tech and cumberland , it is the highest score game in football when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 ."
7685,"you almost have to wonder if cumberland's team was sleeping on the field ! it's rare for a team to score 0 points . even if they just played defensively , you'd think they would have stopped the opposing team from scoring so much ."
7686,"yeah . it is very true . i couldn't imagine how it happens , the poor performance by cumberland . it was a black day for cumberland ."
7687,they could use a player like the patriots' running back benjarvus greenellis . he's never made a fumble in his entire time in the nfl !
7688,yes . the nfl has no written rule against female players .
7689,i wonder what the physical requirements are for a woman to be able to play . i would personally be scared to go on the field with all those powerful guys around me !
7690,"they are making fit for the game , it is very necessary to maintain good health condition for playing ."
7691,"i can believe that . they train to be so fast and strong . some of them are very smart too , like alex smith . he took advanced placements tests in high school and did so well he entered college as a thirdyear student !"
7692,all the players are trained to achieve the excellence so they are working hard . they are very highly paid athlete compared to other player .
7693,"it makes me feel like i ought to go do some exercise myself , even if i'm no football player ! it was great talking to you ."
7694,good day there . you a football fan ? i am mad the nfl season is over . the superbowl was kind of dissapointing but i enjoyed the 16 regular season games .
7695,"hello there , i am and i agree ! it wasn't as fun as other years , my team didn't even make the playoffs so that was sad ."
7696,oh bummer ! yeah just have to wait until next year . maybe it will be more exciting . the nfl tracks movements of players and the ball using a chip !
7697,"yep , always next season . and yeah , i think that is good , i hope it helps with player safety ."
7698,yeah me too . so many injuries . football wasn't always popular though . back in the 60's bowlers made more ! twice as much in fact .
7699,yeah there really are a lot . and wow ! i guess it shows just how popular the nfl has become since then .
7700,exactly . there are also various other forms of football like rugby and australian rules .
7701,there was a big australian rules tournament held in my town last summer !
7702,oh that's awesome ! do they have a quarterback it's one of my favorite positions because they touch the ball almost every play .
7703,"i don't they did , and yeah they are the most important player on the field even during a team game ."
7704,yeah . tom brady is one of the best . did you know he didn't even start when he played junior varsity in high school ?
7705,"yeah he sure is , and i think i read that , wonder how he got scouted in the first place ?"
7706,yeah good question . the qb alex smith is a smart guy too . he took so many ap classes that he got his degree in 2 years !
7707,"holy cow , that is impressive , it sounds like he could have gone into any field he wanted ."
7708,yeah agreed . funny you say that because baker mayfield's field of choice was almost competitive gaming !
7709,"that is hilarious ! i think i read about that a while back , do you know his game was ?"
7710,yeah believe it was halo 3 ! wonder if he still plays video games ?
7711,"that was it ! good call , and i'm sure he does , but probably fortnight or something now ."
7712,yeah fortnight is crazy popular . i wonder how much they make in comparison to the nfl ? despite what everyone thinks engineers actually make more money in their life than nfl players .
7713,"isn't that interesting , but i think it is because they have a very long career as opposed to sports players ."
7714,yeah those nfl players get hammered with injuries . very tough on the body . but some players can take the hits like greenellis who never fumbled the ball once !
7715,do you watch football ? there's no written rule that women can't play in the nfl . i'd love to see that !
7716,i do watch it ! whos your favorite team ? and me too ! i wonder if any have ever tried out yet
7717,my favorite team is the colts . who's your favorite ? the average nfl game only has about 11 minutes of actual gameplay . thank goodness for instant replay !
7718,i root for the patriots . 11 minutes is so short ! the game stops so often
7719,this is interesting an engineer over the course of his or her career will earn more than an nfl player . crazy .
7720,"well if you think about it , an engineer may have like , 45 working years . an average nfl career might only be 10 years at the most , and this average factors in the regular players . not everyone is a superstar making millions"
7721,"true . speaking of the patriots , former rb benjarvus greenellis never had a fumble in his career . wonder how many times he had the ball ?"
7722,haha i hope more than 1 or else that stat isnt as impressive . i feel like he was a common target back in his day
7723,the highest ever football score was 2220 in 1916 . the other team couldn't even get on the board .
7724,i wonder at what point they just gave up and tried to rack up the score ? i feel like they couldnt have been that dominated
7725,"haha . in the 60's the top bowlers made more than the football stars . oh , how times have changed ."
7726,right ? i wonder why ! nowadays i bet most people cant name even one pro bowler
7727,"i know i can't . i don't even know if they show bowling on tv anymore , like they used to when i was younger ."
7728,"i definitely cant name any , and i also have never even seen bowling on tv . i imagine it would be pretty boring to watch"
7729,"oddly , i used to watch it a lot in the 80's . but we only had 3 4 channels and it was the only thing on . did you know espn won an emmy for the creation of the first yard line yellow line on tv ? what a great innovation ."
7730,that yellow line saved football on tv i say . it is an absolute staple and probably one of the most important inventions for tv football
7731,totally agree . i remember when they tried to apply to the same sort of thing to the hockey puck . wasn't as popular .
7732,which i think it would be way more useful in hockey ! i can never follow that puck
7733,me neither . i think it was a good idea . but the hardcore fans hated it so they dumped it . did you know kellan moore is the only lefthanded qb in the league ? wonder if that gives him any kind of advantage .
7734,i feel like it would help him sometimes because so many linemen might be trained to aim for the qbs right side
7735,"yeah , i was thinking the same thing . any advantage is a good advantage . qb alex smith took so many ap tests in hs that he started college as a junior . smart kid ."
7736,"thats an insane amount of ap tests , i cant imagine how he could have managed all of that in high school , i could barely manage 1"
7737,haha . same here . he was working on his master's degree before he was drafted first overall in the 2005 draft .
7738,he had a good fallback plan at least ! did you know the modern huddle was created by a deaf qb back in the day because he had to use hand signals ? he didn't want the other team to see what he was signing
7739,that's awesome !
7740,high how are you
7741,good . is tom brady still with the patriots ?
7742,yes he is for now .
7743,when is the next nfl championship game ?
7744,i think next month .
7745,do you have any guess which team is going to win ?
7746,no i have no clue . you ?
7747,the patriots ?
7748,maybe i would like them to but who knows .
7749,i'm not that familiar with nfl teams . i know it consists of 32 teams .
7750,"yes . the nfl's 17week regular season runs from early september to late december , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week ."
7751,are you going to watch the next super bowl ? it's usually held first sunday of february .
7752,yes i will be watching with my family .
7753,do you usually watch the games at home ? my friend celebrate the super bowl like it is christmas .
7754,yes i watch at home
7755,do you know that the american flags you see at stadiums weigh 1100 pounds ?
7756,i had no clue hard to believe
7757,"they cost approximately 50 , 000 to make them ."
7758,wow thats a lot of money
7759,nfl owners can afford it .
7760,oh espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games .
7761,i did not know that . did they collaborate with the nfl ?
7762,yes they did
7763,i have to run . it was nice chatting with you .
7764,hi how are you ? are you a football person ?
7765,"love the sport , baker mayfiled is one of my favorite players , what about yourself ?"
7766,i dont know baker . who is he ?
7767,"he is a famous qb , he had a strong debut on the browns"
7768,"oh , did the browns do well this season ? is he one of the best in the league ?"
7769,"i don't think his the best , brady is the best qb in the league but mayfield has strong skills"
7770,"brady plays for the patriots , yes ? he is one of the best . six rings at this point ?"
7771,"i think he does yeah , he is a legend and the most important player in the team , well quarterbacks are usually the most important players in the field"
7772,"yeah , they touch the ball on every play , so i guess they have to be talented . who are the other good qbs ?"
7773,"kellan moore is another great one , he used to be the only left handed qb on the nfl"
7774,why the only one ? is there a problem with lefties ?
7775,"i have no idea i think there are a couple more now another good qb is brad johnson , he holds an interesting stat"
7776,brad johnson ? dont know him . he is not a lefty is he ?
7777,"no , he is the only qb in nfl history to throw a td pass to himself ."
7778,how did he do that ? by accident ? i want to see the film of that .
7779,yeah i think that the ball got tipped on a defensive player and then he caught it .
7780,that is great ! one for the record books . what do you think of u of iowas little stunt ?
7781,"i think that stunt was really funny , the magic of football not only strange anecdotes but funny ones as well"
7782,"i wonder if it works at all . does u of iowa win at home ? anyway , great chat"
7783,"thats a topic for a google search as a matter of fact im going to look over that right now , its been great chatting with you as well , bye"
7784,have a great evening ! thanks for the chat .
7785,"a lot of cool facts , i feel lot wiser , thanks a lot , bye ."
7786,hi how are you ? do you like the football ?
7787,"hello , i'm a life long football fan ."
7788,i do not really know the game well . i sometimes watch . usually the playoffs .
7789,at least you watch the important games . the rest is just positioning for playoffs .
7790,i guess . who is your favorite team ?
7791,i like the cincinnati bengals . how about you ?
7792,i like the underdog in the super bowl . i think that it is fun when they beat the favored team .
7793,"haha , yes it's very easy to root for an underdog . speaking of underdogs , i was shocked to read there is only 1 left handed qb in all of the nfl ."
7794,why is that ? is there something unusual about lefties ? are they a problem ?
7795,"kellen moore is the only lefty . it's subtle differences , the ball spins different and the qb's blindside is opposite ."
7796,so the rest of the team has to play differently ? ok . that would make sense . then the coach has to make different plays ?
7797,they don't play different exactly . you just have your best lineman blocking the blindside as that's where the defenses best player usually lines up to attack the qb from out of vision line . that blocker never learns to play right side . plus just fewer people are lefties i assume lol .
7798,ok . that makes sense . what do you think of the university of iowa and their little painting scheme ?
7799,it looks nice on tv .
7800,i suppose it is a pleasing color for the tv audience . i hadnt though of that .
7801,i assume the intent was to belittle opponents like they are little girls but it looks cool when they show locker room shots i think .
7802,i dont mind pink it gets me excited to play . i want to play harder when i surrounded by pink .
7803,i love when the nfl players wear pink shoes and gloves during breast cancer awarenss month . it just pops and very slick looking . what do you think about that or
7804,i think that it would be a little too much for me in my pink locker room . there is such a thing as too much .
7805,"haha very true , they knew what they were doing when they painted the visiting locker room pink ."
7806,"they were not interior decorators . they should have consulted experts . anyway , thanks for the chat !"
7807,very true indeed ! have a great day stranger !
7808,"thanks . you too , total stranger !"
7809,bye !
7810,"hello , do you know much about quarterbacks ?"
7811,i know a little trivia about that particular football position . are we referring to american football or canadian style ?
7812,american football . did you know alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he was a junior when he went to college .
7813,smart dude ! he even started working on his master's before he became the overall 1st pick in the draft .
7814,very smart guy . the circular huddle was created by a qb who was deaf .
7815,yeah . wasn't his name hubbard ?
7816,yep i believe so .
7817,deaf qbs are rare in the nflalmost as rare as lefthanded qbs . i think there is only one in the league right now . . .
7818,yes they are . i can't think of many left handers over the years . only other one that comes to mind is vick .
7819,"i think the current one is named kellan moore . some of the greats were lefthanded , such a john elway and jim kelley ."
7820,oh yea i forgot about elway . baker mayfield once thought about quitting football to pursue a career in professional gaming .
7821,mayfield . . . wasn't he qb at the univ of oklahoma ?
7822,"i can't recall where he played in college , but that sounds right . he plays for the browns now ."
7823,that is a team that has had a rough go at the position of qb ! their franchise would be alot different today if they had a qb like superbowl champion tom brady .
7824,yea they have had terrible luck with qbs . did you know the nfl has no written rule against women playing ?
7825,are you suggesting that cleveland should consider putting a woman in at qb ? it couldn't hurt any !
7826,haha i would like to see that actually .
7827,"the saints don't allow their cheerleaders to dine with players , so securing a qb spot would open up a world of dining that most find an incentive !"
7828,i think a lot of teams have rules around players interacting with cheerleaders .
7829,"well , with the average gameplay time of 11 minutes , what does it really matter ?"
7830,good talking to you !
7831,hi . are you into the los angeles chargers ?
7832,i am not really into football in general . how about you ?
7833,no . but the los angeles chargers seem to have good track record . the are the 11th best in defense in the nfl this year .
7834,they also have the best net passer rating for 2018 along with the chiefs .
7835,"huh , i did not know that . and apparently they also score 2 . 6 points per drive ."
7836,net passer rating is a relibale litmus test for super bowl caliber teams so they are super bowl contenders .
7837,"yes , i think that they are . they are tied with the chiefs in 2018 ."
7838,they also have the seventh best offensive line in the nfl right now
7839,wow . i did not know that . football is also called soccer in some countries .
7840,we really love our football in the us . 14 of the world's 25 biggest stadiums belong to american college football teams .
7841,yes ! and did you know that the highest score ever in a football game occured in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland with a score of 2220 ? !
7842,i wonder what happened to make the score so bad !
7843,"i have no idea . i wish i knew how the score could get so high . they must have changed the rules since then . i have never heard of gaelic football , have you ?"
7844,"no , i have not heard of gaelic football though i have heard of australian football . i think it's the same as american football but the ball is larger ."
7845,and then there is rugby football . they have a rugby league or rugby union . so many different versions of football . it makes my head spin .
7846,football certainly has come a long way . it's crazy the technology that is used in american football these days .
7847,i think it is awesome that former patriots runningback greenellis never fumbled the football at all during his whole career .
7848,"that is amazing . some football players are just so talented . brad johnson , a superbowl winning quarterback has thrown a touchdown pass to himself ."
7849,wow . has it that possible ? and the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
7850,"i am not sure how it's possible . and yeah , there isn't a lot of gameplay which is probably why i am not into football ."
7851,"yeah , me too . some of the rules seem crazy to me . hey , it has been great . thanks ."
7852,i still have so much to learn about the nfl .
7853,do you follow football ? college or nfl ?
7854,"i follow both actually , i love the eagles and ducks !"
7855,the ducks are oregon ? i've heard that iowa painted the locker room for visitors pink .
7856,yes ! i have heard that too ! i also heard 14 of the 25 biggest stadiums in the world are for college football !
7857,there's some serious money in college ball . i wonder whether there will ever be a women's version of the game .
7858,i doubt it would ever catch on to be honest . even mens high school stadiums can cost up to 60 million to build !
7859,"that's true . there has to be money available to build the stadium . maybe they would include women on the men's teams , make it coed ."
7860,"that is a good point , but who knows if there is a market . snoop dogg wrote the fight song for his son's high school football team"
7861,snoop is a man with many talents . i think it's funny that an nfl has only 11 minutes of live gameplay . lots of time for commercials .
7862,it sure does since the games are 3 hours long !
7863,it's interesting that engineers make more during their careers that pro athletes . i guess longevity pays well .
7864,"that really is interesting , they put their body on the line for that too , just to get paid so little"
7865,that's the issue with including women in the game . women would get badly hurt by men . would viewers accept that ?
7866,i do not think so
7867,i wonder whether they would let men become cheerleaders . i know college has male cheerleaders .
7868,"i think they should ! i know saints cheerleaders cannot eat where the players do , which is odd !"
7869,i guess it's to discourage romantic relationships .
7870,"i suppose so , that is still odd to me though . like , they can talk to who they want !"
7871,maybe they had problems in the past .
7872,"i think so , that is all i can think of !"
7873,"i think it's odd that espn won an emmy for the yellow line showing the first down . it's a good addition to the show , but an emmy ?"
7874,"i think that may be overkill , but it certainly is an advancement"
7875,"hi , how are you ?"
7876,"i am well , how are you ?"
7877,"i am doing very well , are you into football at all ?"
7878,i am into football . i can't wiat for today's games . i am from chicago so i am a huge bears fan .
7879,"i am an eagles fan myself , sorry about parkey . apparently most nfl games have about 11 minutes of gametime !"
7880,"i know . good luck today ! saints will be a tough one . . . baker mayfield , quarterback , university of oklahoma , once considered quitting football to pursue fulltime competitive gaming , and claims to be able to beat anyone at the university of oklahoma oneonone in halo 3 ."
7881,"i believe that , he is good at pretty much anything he does , qbs are special , i know alex smith is very smart !"
7882,i had no idea alex smith took that many ap classes . kind of mind boggling . . .
7883,"it really is , doing that as anyone is special , but as an athlete , even crazier !"
7884,"yeah ! the circular huddle used in todays american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not read his hand signals . i had no clue !"
7885,"i wonder how good he was as a deaf quarterback , it might help in opposing stadiums !"
7886,yeah . never thought of that before . i believe it would be a benefit . . . not sure how the speaker would work though . . .
7887,"that is true , and a lot of people would need sign language . but accommodation is always healthy i think , i am glad he had an impact on the game"
7888,"if the speaker stops with 15 seconds on the play clock , sign language could extend that time . i think you found a loophole !"
7889,"i did not think of that , they definitely use hand signals normally , but maybe that is easier to intercept"
7890,is kellan moore still in the nfl ? kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl
7891,"i think he is , maybe on the panthers ? i know michael vick and maybe steve young were left handed"
7892,"yeah . tua , alabama qb is too , . the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements ."
7893,i wonder if maybe they could be a kicker or a punter ?
7894,"nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
7895,"i have never seen those stats presented during games , that would be very interesting to me !"
7896,are you a football fan ? i think it's one of the best sports to watch .
7897,"hey ! i watch sometimes , but not really often . i was surprised that an average nfl game is about 11 minites of live gameplay . it's not a lot"
7898,yes when you break down the actual game action it is surprising . they have to make room for all those commercials !
7899,true . what's your favorite team ?
7900,"i'm a fan of the philadelphia eagles , it's been a fun few years for us recently ."
7901,good to know . i was wondering maybe you are fan of university of iowa and can explain why locker room for visiting team is pink lol because i have no idea lol
7902,i guess they think it would be throw the other team off their game somehow . i don't think the color would bother me if i was a player .
7903,me too actually . i don't think it's big . noise could be a problem . but color is just color .
7904,maybe the georgia tech visiting team locker room was painted pink because they beat a team 2220 .
7905,"honestly , i cannot imagine this score . 2220 is really a lot . it was over century ago , but still . . ."
7906,if that happened today i think it would be on sportscenter for months .
7907,"absolutely . i didn't know that there isn't written rule against female players . i know there some requirements , but i'm wondering what kind of requirements it could be . any idea ?"
7908,the only requirements that i can think of are the regulations for how long out of college they have to be to play in the nfl . i believe they cannot declare for the draft until junior year or a certain age .
7909,"ok , but why does it make problem for potential female players ?"
7910,i do not know the reasoning behind female players . my best guess would be that since they are generally smaller in stature they don't want females to be injured when getting tackled . some football players can weigh over 300 pounds .
7911,"true . well , anyway i understand reason of tradition . this is male sport , but wondering about it since i've read about possibility of female players . i've also read that average lifetime earnings of an enginner is higher than the average lifetime earnings of nfl player . it's surprise for me . i was sure they make a lot . . ."
7912,the very best players do make a lot but there a lot of players who do not have long careers . i believe that probably drives the average down a lot .
7913,right . average is just average . you are right . every time i read about some sort of strange facts or traditions . pink room is one . there is another . new orleans cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same place as any nfl player . it sounds stupid
7914,the nfl teams usually have a fraternization clause for their cheerleaders and players . i'm sure it's to protect their organization from any messy fall out from relationships .
7915,don't you think it looks like old school ? too much old
7916,it does but also at the same time organizations always want to protect themselves from any potential legal issues .
7917,do you watch the nfl ?
7918,"yes i watch the nfl from time to time . there's no rule against female players apparently , would you watch the nfl with females playing ?"
7919,"i am not sure , they may get hurt right away , what do you think ?"
7920,"i think you could have a female kicker , but i don't know that you could have female linebackers or something like that , but who knows maybe it will happen"
7921,there may be a female kicker i just read about that may be the first one . do you watch college football ?
7922,i have watched it from time to time . i remember hearing about the university of iowa's locker room . they painted the opposing team's lockerroom pink lol
7923,"for sure , i like that stadium . the coach was into psychology and read about the pink color . very interesting read"
7924,"yes i agree . also interesting that bowlers in the 60s made twice as much as football stars back then , talk about a reversal"
7925,"for sure , a huge reversal ! i would pursue nfl over bowling now"
7926,"yep absolutely ! i also would pursue being on georgia tech's team versus cumberlands , especially after seeing that georgia tech beat them 222 to 0 lol"
7927,"i feel bad for the other team , i would have quit after 1000 lol !"
7928,haha i agree with you ! riverwatch football on tv though ? apparently espn won an emmy for creating the first down yellow line on tv
7929,i love that yellow thing on the field . i used to think it was a real thing as a kid while watching tv and never understood how they did it lol
7930,haha that's funny ! it's definitely useful . did you hear about how the circular huddle got started by the way ?
7931,"i think from a deaf quarterback , is that right ?"
7932,"yup , he would use the huddle to cover up his hand signals , that way the other team couldn't see what he was doing"
7933,"that is smart , you could easily pick those signals up if there were no huddle . was it paul hubbard ?"
7934,i'm not sure actually . but that sounds like it could be him . do you follow alex smith by the way ? you think he's any good
7935,"he was good , then he got hurt really bad , poor guy . what do you think ?"
7936,"yeah i felt bad he got hurt , but he was so smart , he almost got his master's degree back when he was in college and he passed out of a lot of college classes from when he was in high school"
7937,he was definitely a smart guy who became the 1 pick . good chatting with you !
7938,who is your favorite quarterback ? it is an offensive position in american football .
7939,i don't really have one . although i think it's cool kellan moore is the only left handed qb !
7940,he is one of my favorites of the 32 teams in the nfl .
7941,yes he is . russel wilson is great too and he is still under an mlb contract .
7942,russell is talented . i hope he makes it to the super bowl which is always the first sunday of february .
7943,yes me too . he has been there before . in his mlb contract he was traded to the ny yankees in 2018 .
7944,i wonder how a woman would size up against him in the nfl . women can play as long as they meet eligibility requirements .
7945,"i think she would get killed honestly . high school football is really big in texas . one high school even has a football stadium that seats 18 , 000 people ."
7946,texans get really involved in football . crazy to think it's just a matter of kicking a ball to score a goal .
7947,ha ha are you thinking of soccer ? there is kicking involved in football but it's not that primary way to score a touchdown .
7948,"foot ball goes by many names such as soccer , gridiron football , gaelic football , and rugby football ."
7949,yes many sports are referred to as football . but gridiron football is the biggest variation in america . 14 of the worlds 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams .
7950,bowlers used to make twice as much as footballers . somehow they lost the edge !
7951,wow . that is very surprising . there has also only been one quarterback to throw a touchdown pass to himself and that is brad johnson .
7952,that's a cool thing to be known for ! i wonder how much of the 11 minutes of game play it took for him to do that !
7953,indeed . yes probably just a few seconds lol . doug williams and russell wilson are the only 2 african american quarterbacks to win a super bowl ! my boy vick didn't get his chance !
7954,he should have stayed away from the dogs . that still makes me sad that he was hurting innocent animals .
7955,"terrible really . now that's how he is remembered . speaking of dogs , snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his sons high school football team !"
7956,his song is actually very talented . he could probably beat the crushing record of 2220 between georgia tech and cumberland in 1916 .
7957,"yes he would definitely give the players encouragement . those big flags in the stadium cost 50 , 000 to make ! well it was nice talking with you !"
7958,nice meeting you !
7959,hi there are you interested in football ?
7960,"i like the ravens quite a bit , our defense has been the second best in the nfl this year in points allowed per drive ."
7961,"i heard it was only 1 . 6 points per drive , which forces the other team to a three and out quite a bit !"
7962,definitely . matt judon is a big reason for that he has been having a great year at outside linebacker .
7963,definitely 3 sacks and 5 tackles is nothing to shake your head at !
7964,"the texans have a great pass rush as well jj watt and jadeveon clouwney are a tough pair ,"
7965,"i've been following baker mayfield as well this year , since it is his rookie season he's been doing well with a 71 percent completion rate !"
7966,yes he may have trouble with sacks when they play houston the houston secondary is 11th best .
7967,"yes , for sure . but even if he has to sit in the pocket , that won't hurt houston he isn't as good when he waits to throw the ball ."
7968,yes the jaguars defense is nothing to be afraid of anymore . they are given up almost 4 more points per game than expected .
7969,i think it is interesting how they're able to track all of this data . did you know there are tracking chips in the shoulder pads of the players to gather that type of data ?
7970,yes and in the football too ! probably makes it easier to monitor the game .
7971,"well when you can track velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location it definitely helps to monitor all that information !"
7972,yes with only 11 minutes of gameplay per game it gives the announcers stuff to talk about .
7973,which is pretty crazy kind of like how there's actually no rule against a female playing the nfl too . i wonder how long it will be before a girl gets signed !
7974,i think a girl could be a kicker though maybe not for the saints they wont even let their cheerleaders eat at the same restaurants as the players !
7975,"and if a cheerleader is somewhere , and player comes in later , the cheerleader has to leave ! that seems unfair if they were there first ."
7976,absolutely ! i would rather be an engineer than play football anyway you make more money
7977,i know more than an nfl or mlb player ! that's crazy !
7978,i think it is because their careers are longer less injuries !
7979,so true ! the lifespan of an nfl career isn't terribly long .
7980,yes unless you are tom brady leading his team at quarterback he has way outlasted most players .
7981,very true and he wasn't even allowed to start in high school when his team couldn't even score a touchdown !
7982,his high school coach must regret that ! of course some players do both alex smith was working on his master's degree when he got drafted .
7983,"that's so awesome when nfl players value their education . i mean , alex came in as a junior because he took so many ap tests !"
7984,absolutely . i do like that all types can play football the huddle was created for a deaf quarterback
7985,hello . are you familiar with the nfl ? it has 32 professional football teams .
7986,"yes , my local team is the saints . i do not follow regularly , but i am always intrigued by how tech has infiltrated the game . do you know the nfl has tracking chips in the shoulder pads to record every player's move ?"
7987,"yes , i do . the coaches use technology because they need to track ball speed , rotation , etc . more accurately ."
7988,"what i also find interesting is some of the superstitions and quirky rules . for my saints , the cheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant with any nfl player , even if they were there first ! ! !"
7989,"that is not fair . if the cheerleaders are at the restaurant first , the players should leave ."
7990,i am not sure how that came to be . did you hear about the call against packers linebacker regarding roughing the quarterback ?
7991,"yes , i heard . what do you think about it ?"
7992,i am not sure how the refs can consistently make the call ? hitting the qb in the head or below the knees is prohibited and easy to observe . but the rule that says the defender cannot land on a qb with most or all of body weight ! how do you call that ? ?
7993,"do you know that paul hubbard , a deaf quarterback , started the circular huddle in football ?"
7994,i did not . what was the reason behind it ?
7995,he did not want the other team to read his hand signals .
7996,"ahh . the tradition lives on . today , quarterbacks have radios in their helmets to get calls from the coaches . did you know that in high school , tom brady was a jv backup qb ? you would never believe that considering his nfl record ! !"
7997,"he did not get to play at high school since he was only a backup . yet , he won five super bowl championships ."
7998,do you follow collegiate football ?
7999,i used to . i have no time now . i almost prefer collegiate to professional football .
8000,"i have had season tickets to my lsu tigers for just over 30 years ! even collegiate football has some unusual rituals . did you know the university of iowa locker room for the visiting team is painted pink ? you have to wonder if it is for humiliation , intimidation , or a bit of both ?"
8001,"i think it is both . alex smith , redskins qb , took so many ap tests at high school that he received his bachelor's degree in two years ."
8002,that is amazing considering how many players opt out of completing their degree to enter the nfl draft .
8003,"apparently , kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ."
8004,"i know being left handed can be advantageous in baseball , but is it in football ? during the playoffs , the nfl has a female referee . do you think there will ever be female nfl players ?"
8005,i don't know . the nfl has no written rule against female players but i can imagine that it is hard to meet the league's eligibility requirements . i've got to run . nice chatting with you .
8006,same here . hopefully they can clarify the roughing the passer rule . its kinda hard to see how a 250300 pound rusher cannot put most of his body weight into rushing the passer ?
8007,do you like the nfl ?
8008,i like to watch it sometimes . how bout you ?
8009,i watch it every year on sunday .
8010,oh wow good for you . did you know there is no written law against females playing in the nfl
8011,"yeah , i'm not surprised . also the game play is only 11 minutes ."
8012,that is surprising . it usually takes like 3 hours lol just to watch 11 min
8013,hilarious . it is a bunch of people standing around .
8014,i hear the nfl also puts chips on their players and on the football as well
8015,"yeah , i'm not sure what they do with that data , what do you think ?"
8016,"maybe stats , or training purposes ?"
8017,"yeah , i would think . did you know espn won an emmy for the first down line ?"
8018,that digital first down line is very helpful for people at home and watching on the screen ! that is awesome .
8019,i like it too . same with the thing that follows the puck in hockey .
8020,that one is super helpful ! those pucks move so fast !
8021,"yeah , did they win an emmy for that too ?"
8022,"i have no clue , i enjoy hockey more than football though lol more game time lol"
8023,"yeah , there can be more action in those games . that is for sure ."
8024,yeah seriously . in the 60's top bowlers made more money than football players lol
8025,"that is pretty cool . reminds me of the bill murray bowling movie kingpin . well , nice chatting with you !"
8026,great chatting with ya .
8027,take it easy .
8028,do you like dance ?
8029,"hey there , yes i do dance from time to time , what do you think the giants shoudl do for their 2 draft pick though ?"
8030,i'm not sure ! i don't really watch baseball . what do you think ? i think that professional ballet dancers are athletic in a way . . . they can go through four pairs of pointe shoes in a week .
8031,"well that is a lot of shoes haha , and the giants are actually a football team , they did horribly last year so they are getting the 2 pick this year , i'm just wondering who they are going to pick"
8032,"ah , thought you were talking about the sf giants . a lot of football players do ballet right ?"
8033,i'm not sure do they ? i do know that one team painted the visiting team's locker room pink so maybe they do ? haha
8034,"haha . well i have heard that they do it for physical training . another person who i would not have expected to do ballet was tupac , the rapper ."
8035,"ya i didn't expect that , nor did i expect that top bowlers made twice as much as top football players back in the 1960s"
8036,"wow , that is interesting . around that time bruce lee was performing in a cha cha championship . he won ."
8037,"haha that is impressive , he probably dominated , kind of like georgia tech when they beat cumberland 2220 haha"
8038,"wow , wonder what happened there . when was that ?"
8039,"ya that was back in 1916 , it was the highest scoring football game ever"
8040,"oh , so i guess there is no tv coverage of it since it was so long ago . speaking of tv , do you watch the simpsons ? bart appears in all episodes but one and he isn't even mentioned in that one ."
8041,"wow i didn't know that , did you know that women could play for the nfl ? there is no actual rule against it"
8042,i wonder if we will ever see one . i heard about a woman kicker on tv . i don't usually watch the news but i like comedies like that 70s shows . they tried to remake that verbatim in uk and it was cancelled quickly .
8043,"oh ya i liked that show , and ya i think that women could play , the average nfl game only has about 11 mins of actual gameplay so it doesn't take that much endurance"
8044,"yeah maybe that is why football doesn't hold my attention . i like cartoons better , like pokemon . i've been watching since i was a kid and there have been 750 episodes ."
8045,"oh ya i love pokemon , i saw it as a kid before i became an engineer , at least as an enginner though i will make more over my lifetime than the average nfl player haha"
8046,interesting ! plus i think engineers are better at managing their money .
8047,"yup thats it , plus nfl players only play for a limited number of years , that definitely affects it"
8048,i have to get into football more though . it looks so cool on hdtv . luckily we don't have to watch it in monochrome anymore !
8049,i like it when the police have fun on local media . like after the cleveland browns got ' robbed ' by the officials .
8050,"yeah , they declared that a ' robbery ' warrant had been issued . and just to make sure , they clarified that it was a joke ."
8051,"yes . even though the call was close the browns still had an 8 point lead at the time , they could have still won ."
8052,a few plays later there was another controversial call .
8053,yes and considering that it was a home game it is surprising that the officials did that .
8054,the officials decided that hyde had come up too short .
8055,yes that is a shame for the browns but that is how it goes in the nfl . only 6 teams from each conference can go to the playoffs .
8056,after that the browns still had an eight point lead but could not keep the raiders from scoring a touchdown .
8057,"yes so it was natural that they lost . it was almost a given that the patriots would end up in the super bowl again , held on the first sunday in february ."
8058,"yeah , i don't watch football but i did watch the super bowl . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . maybe that's why it doesn't hold my attention ."
8059,"yes , but it is interesting how much technology is in the game now . they have tracking chips inside the shoulder pads and helmets ."
8060,the superimposed line that espn created is pretty neat too . they got an emmy for it .
8061,"that is pretty crazy . i just can't wait to see what the ratings do if there ever is a woman player its allowed in the nfl , just has never happened ."
8062,"yeah even if a woman player meets the requirements i wonder if they'd find another way to keep her from playing . i know that players are more important to the nfl than cheerleaders but it still seems sexist how the saints cheerleaders need to leave an establishment even if they are already eating there , if saints players come in and want to eat there ."
8063,"yes that is very sexist . i don't think it is likely that a woman will become a quarterback , but i could certainly see one being the kicker ."
8064,"yeah , that makes sense . i am female , though i don't know if i would even want to be a football player . i'd rather be an engineer , as they make more than the average nfl player on average , over a lifetime ."
8065,absolutely . much less chance of injury ! there are some people who can do both alex smith was working on his master's degree when he became the number one pick in the draft .
8066,"yeah , it's cool that he was such a good student and had a backup plan . i wonder if he was on the football team in high school . if he was , how did he find so much time to take so many ap tests that he entered university as a junior ? !"
8067,that is a good question . its so funny that tom brady was never even allowed to play in high school even though his team never won a game or scored a touchdown !
8068,"haha , that is funny . do you think that gaming is a better career ? baker mayfield was going to quit football to pursue a full time gaming career ."
8069,that is pretty crazy ! its certainly safer !
8070,hello how are you today ?
8071,"great . are you an nfl football fan , and do you follow qbs like the redskins' kirk cousins , by any chance ?"
8072,hello i am a football fan . i don't know much about kirk cousins though .
8073,"seems cousins contract deal with the redskins did not go well , for either qb or team , , and he became ' expendable ' as they say . what does that mean , really ?"
8074,that's interesting . not really sure what that means though . did you know the nfl has no written rule against women playing ?
8075,"i've heard that . thought contracts were written rules . sometimes players get franchised or tagged . fellow players often weigh in on talk shows , too . did you know cousins wanted about 30 deal to stay with redskins ?"
8076,i did not know that . i saw the average football game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
8077,interesting . must mean lots of minutes for commercials . . .
8078,i would think so . the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in the players shoulder pads .
8079,"yes . i understand that's to record a player's every move on the field . they're inside footballs , too ."
8080,yep pretty much . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is actually higher than the average nfl player .
8081,that's an interesting fact . do you attribute that to players' careerending injuries ?
8082,quite possibly . not too sure on that one .
8083,"sometimes criticism can help end a player's career , too . for example , redskins safety , deangelo hall made some controversial statements about his thenqb , cousins , when a guest analyst on espn ."
8084,wow did not know that . the nfl consists of 32 teams .
8085,"yes . each team is run by a front office . fyi : hall wants to become a frontoffice employee for the redskiins , and already sounds like one , some people say ."
8086,interesting . who is your favorite football team ?
8087,followed the redskins ; sorry to see the chiefs take them out of super bowl contention .
8088,i'm a bengals fan . just hoping we can make it to the playoffs this year .
8089,sometimes wonder if fans outside the us understand our version of football .
8090,it was good talking to you !
8091,do you like or follow the nfl ?
8092,hi
8093,do you like watching football ?
8094,"sometimes , although it gets loud in my house"
8095,do you have a favorite team ?
8096,"panthers are my kids so i have to go with them , how about you ?"
8097,"im from new england so the patriots ,"
8098,"cool . i've been reading up on some things i didn't know about , some trivia and stuff like what the different 'football sports are called in different countries ."
8099,"cool , can you share some of those facts with me ! i sure want to learn today"
8100,"sure thing ! like in england , its called football but in usa we call it soccer . its not the same play only called by same name ."
8101,"i love soccer and yeah its not the same thing , two totally diferent sports ,"
8102,"and like in australia football is called rugby football ! not sure what or if there is a difference in play though , do you ?"
8103,"the rules are different yeah , i like football better though , i dont really understand rugby"
8104,"yeah , too ! lol ! one thing am glad about is espn , they really do a bang up job with that yellow line"
8105,"that yellow line has made the game easier to understand , i like it a lot do you think espn deserved the emmy because of it ?"
8106,"oh yeah ! they should have gotten a noble for it , it was genius !"
8107,"i share the same opinion , it might seem like a small thing but it changed how we view the game ,"
8108,"no doubt ! such a small thing too , but oh so worth it for fans or even nonfans to help in learning the game ."
8109,"i wish i was as good as benjarvus green ellis , i would win so much money"
8110,"funny you should mention that , i also read in my trivia this ; that the lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than the average earnings of an nfl player ! wow !"
8111,"i guess i have to become an engineer then lol , anyway nice chat , a lot of useful info about the beautiful game of football ."
8112,hey there ! do you like football at all ?
8113,"good evening , yes , i do like football . don't hate me , but my favorite team is the patriots !"
8114,"oh nice ! haha , i don't hate you ! isn't tom brady a patriot ?"
8115,"yeah , the goat is the quarterback for the patriots ."
8116,haha . what does goat mean ?
8117,"greatest of all time ! which by many , he is considered the best quarterback , me included . lol"
8118,"oh ! yeah i hear a lot about him ! i've heard that he reached 1 , 000 career rushing yards . what does that mean ?"
8119,"he's awesome , that's what it means . basically he'll run the ball as well as throw the passes ."
8120,"it's kind of weird to me , that the word football , can mean soccer or football , depending on where a person is in the world ."
8121,"i know , it's confusing . but to me football is football and soccer is not football at all . lol"
8122,same ! here is a fun fact : in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ! bowling isn't anywhere as popular as football . i guess it fell out of favor .
8123,"yes , it has . i like to take the kids bowling every now and then , and i know there is a professional circuit for bowling , but i don't think of it that way . just a kid's game to me ."
8124,i bet you can fantasy draft bowling . i mean people draft everything else . did you know that former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the ball in his nfl career ?
8125,"yes , i had read about him , i can't imagine the pressure he must have felt to remain perfect ."
8126,i know ! mess up just one time and that record is gone !
8127,i couldn't have did it !
8128,"me neither i am a horrible football player ! cumberland must have been a team full of people like me when they lost 2220 to georgia tech , which happens to be the highest score ever in a football game ."
8129,"that's pitiful ! that wouldn't happen today , i don't think . the last superbowl i watched was the lowest scoring ever ."
8130,"yeah that game was way back in 1916 . i didn't even know football was that old . shouldn't how long it's been around solidify that it is football , and soccer is soccer ! how is the world not on the same page about this ! ? it's kind of crazy ."
8131,i agree with you !
8132,": , well , hey it was really nice talking to you !"
8133,"nice chatting with you as well , have a good night !"
8134,do you like football ?
8135,football ? the game is insanely popular ! who does not like the football ? everyone plays it around this world .
8136,i dont think football is that popular other than in the states ! ! ! maybe you are thinking of soccer ?
8137,"ah , yes , the soccer ! that is the word that is used to call it in the america . thank you . yes , i like the soccer . the other sport , the football , used much in the us . yes ."
8138,"soccer is a graet sport i also like it , so you like american football aswell ?"
8139,i have not seen the football american except on the tv and then only with a friend who did not explain it to me .
8140,"well its a great game , you should watch it some time im sure you will love it , there are 32 teams and two divisions"
8141,"ok , that is many teams . i might not be able to follow all of them . what is the best team right now ?"
8142,"the patriots is the best team , they won the last superbowl wich would be like the champions league in comparisson to soccer"
8143,"i see . the patriots are very good at kicking the ball , and throwing it from time to time . everybody must love the patriots . such an american name !"
8144,"many people hate them as well because they tend to win all the time , i love them personally"
8145,"i think that winning makes you a winner , and people should love winners , especailly the american people ."
8146,yeah winning is great ! so the most important position in the game is filled by the qb
8147,the qb ? the quarterback ? it sounds like a difficult and dangerous job .
8148,"yeah the quarterback , qb is the abbriviation , the are part of every offensive play so yeah , really important job the one they do"
8149,the qb should get paid the most then because they have to deal with the ball all the time . it is a heavy burden for one person .
8150,"in most teams they are , so tom brady , a leyend of the game , used to be bench in his high school team , his team would lose so many game and the coach wouldnt start him"
8151,he was not old enough to bear the qb burden . it is hard for one who is young . he needed to age to the right age for carrying the burden of the qb .
8152,"yeah maybe he wasnt good enough back then or he had a terrible coach ,"
8153,that is a possibility . i have come to learn many things this chat . thank you the chat . thank you very much the chat .
8154,"there are a lot more interesting facts about the game , hope you watch it some day ."
8155,"hey there , do you watch nfl ?"
8156,"yes , i used to live in kansas city and had season tickets to the chiefs for 10 years before getting transferred to the east coast . i enjoy watching the nfl a lot ."
8157,nice . did you know women can play too if they make the cut ?
8158,"no that surprised me , though perhaps if the codified that rule they'd be in some legal problems . i could see a woman kicker , are you fan of the nfl ?"
8159,not really but watch it sometimes . after all the gameplay is only 11 minutes
8160,"yes , that surprised me , but i guess with the violent contact and injuries that may be a good thing and it let the netorks see more advertising time . i live near boston now and was humored to see tom brady was a backup in highschool for a team that lost all their games and didn't score . he's had a little more success out here ."
8161,oh for sure he has come a long way . have you heard of alex smith ?
8162,"yes , i didn't know he was so smart . i still follow the chiefs every week and he tutored patrick mahomes last year , a class guy though his broken leg was painful to watch this year . i was surprised that the average engineer makes more than the average nfl or mlb player , i guess there's a lot of short carrers to bring the average down ."
8163,yeah . do you know who invented the circular huddle and how it came about ?
8164,"yes , i googled it and it was paul hubbard in 1892 , interesting being deaf . now the coaches all cover they mouths and huddle to keep the other team from lipreading the signals . i got a grad degree at iowa , i didn't know then the visiting locker room was pink , that kind of funny ."
8165,"i know . i really wonder why that is , if it serves a purpose or has a reason behind it"
8166,"seems like a feminizing act i guess or just a distraction from the game preparation . i thought the new orleans satints were a little rough on their cheerleaderes , can't dine with a player and have to leave midmeal is one shows up at their restaurant , that seems a little one sided and sexist ."
8167,"i really agree with you there , i do not see a point in that rule at all . they can play in the game if they qualify and yet cannot eat in the same place as other players ."
8168,"maybe it was designed to make it difficult to date ? no sense to me . i do travel to europe a lot , funny they consider football what we consider soccer , but i was surprised how many flavor of football there are besides those to , australian , gaelic , etc ."
8169,yeah i guess each country has their own concept of what constituted football . the nfl guys do not seem to make much money though .
8170,"less than an engineer on average lifetime , i know . i see where as i mentioned patrick mahomas of the chiefs is set to resign for 200 million , maybe that will bring the average up ."
8171,"could be , i read an article about a nfl player who teaches during the off season to make ends meet"
8172,"back when i was in kc they said in the 1960's all the players had summer jobs , like will lanier the big linebacker delivered refrigerators . i think with the increased salary they can train year round which is good given the beating their bodies take ."
8173,yeah exactly . and now they place chips on their padding to track movements and such .
8174,"i read that and wondered about that . i wasn't sure to what end they embedded the chip in the sholder pads , did that make any sense to your , do you see a reason ? i see why they track the ball for first down and out of bounds or touchdowns kind of things ."
8175,well nowaydas they can maybe track movement and also impact and make better clothing and helmets to protect them . just an opinion . nice chatting with you
8176,hi how are you ? i have talked about football quite a bit today . do you like football
8177,"hello , i love watching football actually , how about you ?"
8178,i dont watch football much . i try to watch the super bowl .
8179,"yea the superbowl is awesome . i like college football , my alma mater is the university of iowa hawkeyes , they paint their opponents locker room pink"
8180,why do they do that ? what would that do ?
8181,they do that because pink is a calming color and they try to relax the other team before they play them . it is straight psychology 101 .
8182,does it work ? does iowa win a lot at home ?
8183,"they actually do . ive only been to a few games they have lost at home . they tend to beat ranked opponents pretty easily there like michigan and ohio state , crazy"
8184,i guess the other teams should start painting the visitor locker room pink . lol
8185,"right , i wonder why no other teams do it . it works obviously lol . do you have a favorite quarterback"
8186,i dont . i guess i liked joe montana and steve young . they were great .
8187,"for sure , hall of famers back to back was awesome for the 49ers . i liked alex smith , he was too a 49er , super smart guy also"
8188,"he was very bright . did quite well in high school and college , i hear ."
8189,"yep , he went into college as a junior i think and then got his masters before coming the number 1 pick overall"
8190,that is amazing . i wish more football players were that academically oriented .
8191,right ! you only hear of the bad things happening with players and not the genius side of some of the players .
8192,"yes , i think that the sport calls for a lot of hard work and discipline . that can be applied in the classroom ."
8193,"for sure . i like benjarvus green ellis because he took smarts to the game of football , he never fumbled in his career once !"
8194,"does he have giant hands , hands like steam shovels ? or the grip of a mighty warrior ? what is his secret ? anyway , great chat !"
8195,"something i dont know what it is lol , he needs to teach a clinic . have a great weekend !"
8196,"you too . have a nice weekend ! talk to benjarvus , and pitch the idea of a clinic to him ."
8197,"for sure , ill include you also !"
8198,hey there ! are you a fan of the nfl ? i am a bears fan . hard to believe i love a sport so much that only has 11 minutes of gameplay !
8199,i'm a giants fan but also follow the all 32 nfl teams to a degree
8200,"nice ! saquon looks like he will be a star . football has come a long way in general . only about 60 years ago , top bowlers made double the amount of top football players !"
8201,"that's pretty crazy , the first nfl playoff game was played on an 80 yard long dirt field inside chicago"
8202,"inside a hockey stadium , right ? wild !"
8203,"yea , i believe it was the chicago blackhawks stadium"
8204,very cool . i love the subtle gamesmanship that goes on in football like iowa painting the visiting locker room .
8205,that's pretty crazy . did you know since 1999 the qb with the most wins in the browns' stadium is ben roethlisberger ?
8206,"haha , that is hilarious . the browns are almost as bad as cumberland university . they once lost 2220 to georgia tech !"
8207,that is pretty awful . apparently the only rocket scientist coaching in the nfl is matt parrcia
8208,"wow , would think he should be a better coach ! some guys are smart like alex smith . he had so much ap credit he was able to enroll in college as a high school junior ."
8209,alex smith is really smart . speaking of qbs did you know russell wilson is under a mlb contract for the ny yankees ?
8210,i have heard that before . he is actually one of the two african american qbs to win the super bowl . that is really hard to believe .
8211,"yea , they other one to win a super bowl was doug williams"
8212,doug williams did it for the redskins . what do you think about the redskins secondary this year adding orlando scandrick ?
8213,i don't think adding scandrick will help the redskins secondary much
8214,"no , i would think they should do something to help out their run defense which was 32nd in the league in 2017 ."
8215,"yea , spending 10 million on scandrick is really gonna hurt them trying to improve the run defense"
8216,"he is a good player , but as their start safety swearinger tweeted sarcastically , ' we had the 9th ranked pass defense , but we def need more consistency in the secondary . '"
8217,"it doesn't help that candrick is already 31 years old , i don't think he has much left in the tank"
8218,nope he probably does not . it was great chatting with you ! good luck to the giants this year !
8219,alex smith is no . 11 on the washington redskins .
8220,i read that ! do you watch football ?
8221,"yes , i like the redskins actually . 200 season ticket holders welcome him to the team ."
8222,could you imagine ? the 13year veteran signed a fouryear extension worth 94 million that includes 71 million in guaranteed money after being traded from the kansas city chiefs for cornerback kendall fuller and a thirdround pick .
8223,"yes , that is a lot of money . smith had to learn a lot from watching game film ."
8224,do you know if he is a good player ? i think it's odd they name fields after businesses now .
8225,yes he was good ! the redskins however haven't played in the playoffs since 2015 !
8226,"oh no ! that makes this sad then , joe hoffmaster said he has had season tickets for 41 years and swore smith would ' galvanize ' the fan base in a way quarterback kirk cousins did not ."
8227,interesting . they also have won only two division titles since 2000 .
8228,that is sad . so is this . . the junipero serra high school jv football team recorded a historically bad season in which they failed to win a game or even score a touchdown yet they never attempted to start their backup quarterback . that backup quarterback they refused to start is 4 time super bowl champion tom brady .
8229,they weren't very good ! alex smith however was really smart in school . he took so many ap tests in high school he entered college as a junior .
8230,that is smart . not relying just on football !
8231,"definitely , he was able to get his bachelor's degree in only 2 years ."
8232,wow ! a lot of these hits seem to be about football ! former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
8233,cool fact ! did you know the nfl has no written rule against female players .
8234,that is cool ! this blows me away too . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
8235,amazing because they last for hours ! and the players make millions of dollars .
8236,"thats true ! sports commonly called football in certain places include association football , known as soccer in some countries , ; gridiron football , specifically american football or canadian football , ; australian rules football ; rugby football , either rugby league or rugby union , ; and gaelic football ."
8237,didn't know that . but the highest score ever in a football game was when ga tech defeated cumberland 2220 !
8238,thats crazy ! espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games .
8239,i like watching many shows on espn they make great programming .
8240,did you watch any of the nfl playoffs this past weekend ?
8241,yes . they go back a long way . the first nfl playoff game was played on an 80 yard field in chicago stadium .
8242,"wow , i didn't know that . it was too bad they lost ."
8243,chicago stadium is the old indoor arena that the chicago blackhawks used to play in .
8244,that's interesting . do you know what the highest scoring game of football ever was ?
8245,in the 1970's i remember washington scored over 70 points against the ny giants .
8246,that's a lot of touchdowns . well it was a college game where georgia won by 222 points !
8247,wow ! i wonder if the losing college kept playing football .
8248,right ! i guess the university of iowa's visiting locker room is pink . that's intimidation for you .
8249,"college football is surely popular . of the 25 largest stadiums in the world , 14 belong to american colleges ."
8250,"wow , i did not know that . the nfl has no written rule on women being prohibited from playing ."
8251,the bills had a female coach at one time .
8252,i didn't know that . i think it would be cool if a female player made a team and excelled . i think it would give hope to generations of young sports fans .
8253,there are some very smart people involved in football . lions head coach matt patricia is a rocket scientist by education . he looks like rasputin .
8254,"really , that is a very cool fact . another wild fact is that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual gameplay , the rest is setting up plays and moving down the field ."
8255,i believe that . and the nfl now has tracking chips embedded in pads to record player movement . hopefully that will improve safety . a lot of players get hurt in those eleven minutes .
8256,"yes , i know safety has become a top issue lately in the nfl ."
8257,"that's why nick foles gets to qb the eagles , and not wentz ."
8258,"yeah , i agree with that . well i'm sure it will be another exciting superbowl this year ."
8259,i wonder if it will be the eagles against the patriots ?
8260,"i don't think so , but at this point it very well could be . nice talking with you ."
8261,"hello , do you like football ?"
8262,yes . football is the team sports which allow the player to kick the ball in various degree to the goal .
8263,is it ? i feel like its more of a hands throwing kinda sport .
8264,ancient greece and romans played many ball games some of use feet to kick the ball .
8265,"thats cool , maybe that evolved into soccer ."
8266,yes . nfl player earn higher than other players . there was no written rule against female players .
8267,thats interesting . in the 60's top bowlers made more than football players .
8268,"in october 1916 , georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 is the highest score in the history ."
8269,wow thats a very high scoring game . what a shame for the losing team .
8270,i think cumberland fans feel very upset .
8271,i recently found out that espn won an emmy for the digital first down line .
8272,it is very interesting . nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record movement in the field .
8273,"yes , they also use it in the football as well ."
8274,"the different variations of football are know as football codes . in 20th century , several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world ."
8275,"yeah , which variation are you a fan of ?"
8276,quarterbacks are members of the offensive team and line up directly behind the offensive line .
8277,oh thanks for letting me know . i hear there is a former patriots player who never fumbled the ball .
8278,who was that player ?
8279,benjarvus green ellis .
8280,super . the quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive play and is the offensive player that almost always throws forward passes .
8281,i hear the university of iowa's locker room for the opposing team is painted pink .
8282,it is very interesting .
8283,its been great chatting with you .
8284,"hi , how are you ?"
8285,i'm doing great tonight ! how are you doing ?
8286,"i am doing well , thanks ! do you like football ?"
8287,i usually watch nfl right around playoff time . do you like football ?
8288,i love it ! did you know iowa's locker room for their visitors is pink ?
8289,iowa is trying some sort of mind game . i don't think it works well or other teams would imitate . how has iowa done at home ? do they win ?
8290,they are usually a pretty good home team . they have a tear jerking tradition where they wave to the cancer hospital for kids after the 3rd quarter .
8291,"hey , that's great ! the kids must love that sort of thing . so much money goes to football . the highest paid across all u . s . department of defense employees are three football coaches of the service branch teams"
8292,"well if they win 2220 , they deserve it !"
8293,"i guess , but that was back in 1916 . what a game . i wonder who scheduled that one ."
8294,they probably got fired after it if they were from cumberland . oi !
8295,georgia tech should have put in their cheerleaders to make it a fair game .
8296,haha ! funny ! i would have left early if i was a cumberland player . like a saints cheerleader at dinner if a saints player walk sin . .
8297,i think that's a silly rule in this day and age . the cheerleaders don't get paid much to begin with .
8298,that's sexism ! but there is no rule against them playing in the nfl .
8299,"i could definitely see females playing football ! there is no feeder system though , like college or high school ."
8300,they could work for espn and make up a yellow line . that would win them an emmy !
8301,"an emmy for a line . well , that must have been a weak year for the emmys ."
8302,ha ! i have been saying that ! a yellow line . . .
8303,"it is so obvious now , but i guess at the time , it was a breakthrough . did you know that those huge american flags at football stadiums weigh 1 , 100 pounds and cost 50 , 000 to make ?"
8304,that's a heavy flag ! nice chatting with you !
8305,"how's it going , do you follow football ? the eagles were really struggling at the beginning of the season"
8306,"i don't watch football that much . yeah , the eagles have yet to win two games in a row ."
8307,"yea , wentz hasn't been recovering too well from his injury either"
8308,"yeah , he has been struggling with that knee injury for less than a year . they also lost jay ajayi ."
8309,"the eagles offense has been really struggling , they have a lot of problems"
8310,wonder if they will be able to pull things together . it seemed like they were coming off a road victory over the giants but they didn't build on that .
8311,"yea , it's not good that the eagles lost three of the four previous games"
8312,i haven't been keeping up with what's going on in football . i'm not too interested . maybe because each game has only about 11 minutes of live gameplay .
8313,it's pretty crazy how many injures the nfl has with only 11 minutes of gameplay
8314,haha you are right ! maybe i would watch more if there were women in the nfl . there are actually no written rules against female players .
8315,i can see a female place kicker playing since there is no rules against it in the nfl
8316,"yeah i have heard there is one who has potential who is now playing on the men's football team at her university . however , i know that players are more important than cheerleaders but it still seems wrong that when saints players enter an establishment where cheerleaders are already dining that the cheerleaders have to leave ."
8317,it seem like a very antiquated rule that saints cheerleaders can't be in the same restaurant as male players
8318,"yes , i agree . well , maybe women are better off being engineers anyway because the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings as an nfl player ."
8319,"that's pretty crazy , well back in 1960 the top bowlers made more than nfl players"
8320,"yeah , it's surprising how much football popularity has risen . the technology has gotten so much better as well ."
8321,"yea , espn won an emmy for the yellow line representing the first down"
8322,and there are tracking chips in footballs and shoulder pads .
8323,football has come a long way since paul d . hubbard invented the circular huddle
8324,and i don't think a university football team would lose 2220 this day and age like cumberland did to georgia tech in 1916 .
8325,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
8326,surprising that the university of iowa's locker room is completely painted pink
8327,"i read that it was the visitor's locker room that was painted pink . i wonder if it was supposed to be some sort of insult or something , though it's not really , since pinkis cool in football these days . football players wear it for breast cancer ."
8328,i don't know but maybe it was originally a girls room . in the 1960's top bowlers made 2x's the amount of top football stars
8329,it is interesting how much popularity football has gained since then . i find it interesting too that the technology has advanced so much .
8330,"yes , tracking chips inside players shoulder pads record players every move . i wonder if they use them outside of the game ?"
8331,"yes , that is one of the interesting technologies . it's also funny that espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow line ."
8332,interesting invention . did you know that each nfl game only has about 11 minutes of live gameplay ? i wish we could just watch those in fast speed without commercials . i guess with technology i might be able
8333,"yeah , maybe football would interest me more then . i lose interest when watching football ."
8334,i like that bands mostly . an engineer makes more in a lifetime than the average nfl player
8335,"speaking of careers , baker mayfield once was going to quit football in order to become a full time competitive gamer ."
8336,he claimed he could beat anyone at the university of oklahoma oneonone at halo 3 . do people really make a living as a gamer ?
8337,"i think there are really rich gamers , but you have to be really good ."
8338,odds seem against people i would think to make out at that career . the highest score ever at a football game was georgia defeating cumberland 2220 .
8339,"yes , but odds are also against most in the nfl as well . that is funny about cumberland ! doubt any of them made it pro !"
8340,that's true too . i wonder if females will make it to the football pros ? there is no written rule against females being eligible
8341,"i hope one day it happens but i'm not sure because of the biological differences . you never know , though . i wish more people were into watching women's sports ."
8342,"yes , certain musculature is different . did you know that footballs in the nfl have tracking chips ?"
8343,"yes , i learned that recently . is the tracking for data purposes or to ensure everything is fair , or something else ?"
8344,"i'm not sure , but probably to analyze with some computer so they can improve upon technique . if you are poor , i guess you don't benefit from all these upgrades in ' talent ' from learning these things"
8345,"true . speaking of inventions in the nfl , did you know that the circular huddle was made by a deaf quarterback so that the other team couldn't see his signals ?"
8346,"yes , i've heard that one a few times . i wonder if there is some tracking spy device now they use to overcome that ?"
8347,that technology could very well exist !
8348,"hi , how are you this evening ? have you experienced many disconnections ? i have !"
8349,"yes , i have ! i am good , how are you ? brett favre apparently tried out for monday night football and failed ."
8350,"was there a test for how far he could throw a football ? he would do well at that . the speaking part , maybe not so good ."
8351,he is no longer under consideration . favre denies it was like that .
8352,the man is a hasbeen . he should just go back to his hometown and take up his old life .
8353,he thought it was important to clear it up so he went onto twitter . he said it went well but that he did not want to go into broacasting right now .
8354,"yes , that sounds completely reasonable . probably wants to drive a tractor , hunt wild animals with a football . did you know that the nfl has no rule against women players ?"
8355,ha . i heard that . i hope a woman will be able to meet the eligibility requirements one day .
8356,"it would make the game more interesting , maybe more dainty . i would like to see a woman kicker or punter . maybe a women coach or two ."
8357,then again i am doubtful . the nfl seems a bit old fashioned . saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if players come in after them and want to eat there .
8358,"the cheerleaders get treated badly . low pay , long hours , there should be a union . plus maybe men cheerleaders ?"
8359,"haha , right ? i am not too interested in watching football in any case . maybe because there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
8360,"i would watch it if i could make money on it . i wouldn't want to play , even at 11 minutes a game . too risky . career too short ."
8361,"righ , i heard that the average engineer earns more on over a lifetime than the average football player"
8362,"women would be better off going into engineering . they could make more , and not suffer so many concussions . the brain is the center of intelligence , even in football players ."
8363,"yeah , i've heard that some football players have suffered depression because of brain injuries"
8364,"cte is a serious problem . probably engineers should work on better helmets , but that might not be enough . maybe chips in the helmets to track impact ?"
8365,"yeah , if they have that technology to track footballs and players every move they should be able to do that"
8366,the highest score ever in a football game happened in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 . no technology at the time to track that embarrassment . the gt coach should have put women in the game .
8367,"wow , that seems like a game i would want to watch . wonder what happened ."
8368,"i would have bet on the game , but what was the spread ? well , as they say on the flintstones , i had a gay old time . talk at ya later ."
8369,"hello , are you a fan of the nfl ?"
8370,"hey there , yes i am . did you know women can play in the nfl ?"
8371,yeah i guess there is no written rule as long as they qualify .
8372,"yeah pretty cool , hope they try for it . the game is only 11 minutes"
8373,exactly the rest of the timer we are glued to the tv stuck with commercials and the players getting into position
8374,yeah pretty much . did you hear about that rule about new orleans cheerleaders ?
8375,yes about them now being able to eat in the same restaurant as the players
8376,yes and the worst part is that they have to also leave midmeal
8377,"so sexist , hope they get rid of it . engineers apparently make more than players"
8378,yeah i guess they have longer careers so that would allow them to make more money
8379,yeah that makes sense actually . did you know they are using tracking chips on the players now ?
8380,yeah they are tracking speed and velocity and all that fun stuff
8381,yeah i hope they can use that to reduce concussions on player and make the game safer .
8382,that would be awesome . do you know who alex smith is ?
8383,yeah he is a great qb and a genius it seems . he finished college in two years
8384,yeah he managed to do that by taking lots of ap tests in high school
8385,"yeah smart kid , planned ahead . did you know alex smith finished college in two year ?"
8386,yeah the kid was so smart he took ap tests in high school and was done college in a breeze
8387,yup . baker mayfield also wanted to quit football and become a competitive gamer
8388,well it is a good thing he changed his mind . he still claims that he can beat lots of peope in halo 3
8389,"yeah , i wonder if there is any truth in there though"
8390,"lets talk about quarterbacks , the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback originally ."
8391,"i've heard that , paul d . hubbard , he did it so the other team could not read his hand signals . that's pretty innovative ."
8392,"i agree , there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl , kellan moore"
8393,"oh wow , i didn't realize that . it seems that tom brady had a rough start in football , his jv team had a historically bad season in which they didn't win a game nor score a touchdown , yet they never gave him a chance to play because he was the backup quarterback ."
8394,"baker mayfield could have went another path , he really enjoys gaming , such as halo 3"
8395,it's a good thing he stuck with football . he did pretty great for his rookie season with the browns .
8396,alex smith has his bachelor's degree and was able to achieve that in only 2 years
8397,"oh wow , that's cool . he's done better than me . i went to school for 6 years for an associates . haha ."
8398,"lets talk about the nfl next , women could play in the nfl , there is no written rule against it"
8399,"i didn't know that , i'm surprised there hasn't been a woman to play . i think it would be great ."
8400,"there are so many commercials , the average game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay"
8401,that's pretty wild . they take like 3 hours . i guess that's how they make their money .
8402,there are tracking chips in player's shoulder pads that the nfl uses to track movement on the field .
8403,"that's neat . do they use it to track velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ?"
8404,"yes , engineers can make more in a lifetime then nfl players"
8405,"that's crazy to think , but i guess an engineer's career is a lot longer than an nfl player ."
8406,"yes , lets talk about football next , bowlers in the 1960's made twice that of nfl players"
8407,oh wow . did you know that the high score ever in a football game was 2220 ?
8408,"interesting , the creation of the yellow first down line won espn an emmy"
8409,that's a prestigious award . i've heard that university of iowa's visiting locker room is completely painted pink . that has to fire up the opposing team .
8410,benjarvus greenellis in his nfl career has never fumbled .
8411,"hi , how are you ?"
8412,im doing great . are you an nfl fan ?
8413,"yes , i am . go patriots ! how about you ?"
8414,go steelers . lol . did you know that there have been ony two black qbs win the super bowl .
8415,"wasn't aware of that . i know my man , tom brady has won more than two ! how many has your big ben won ?"
8416,he has two . did you know that brad johnson actually threw a td pass to himself ?
8417,"cool , i don't even know how that's possible , but ok ."
8418,a linemen tips the ball into the air . then the qb catches the ball off the tip and runs into the end zone . lol .
8419,"i knew physics was involved , somehow ! lol sounds like a risky move ."
8420,well they dont do it on purpose . its just haw the play happened . did you know that there is only one left handed qb in the nfl .
8421,"seems like there would be more than 1 , it must be some type of advantage . i know your team wasn't in the last superbowl , but did you watch it ?"
8422,it was on but i didnt really watch it lol . i cant stand the patriots .
8423,"i knew it ! people love to hate on my patriots . i grew up in that area and have always followed them , so i can't help it , ok ! lol that dang game was over three hours long , i about ran out of beer ."
8424,it will be ok . did yo u know that 14 of the 25 largest stadiums belong to college football teams ?
8425,"i live in the south , now . so yeah i know how big college football is ! so , i can understand why the stadiums are big , heck even some of the high school stadiums would impress you ."
8426,that is true . the first playoff game for the nfl was played on a 80 yard field in chicago stadium in 1932 .
8427,"probably , none of those old timers still alive that played in that game ."
8428,i think it would be possible but probably not very many .
8429,"that's back when they wore those little thin skull caps for helmets . hardly no rules at all , basically anything goes !"
8430,hey did you know ben roethlisberger has the most wins by a qb in the browns home stadium since they were reinstated ?
8431,"i didn't know that fact . hey , it's been fun chatting with you this morning about all things football . i hope you enjoy the rest of your day ."
8432,"hi , do you like football ?"
8433,i have a passing knowledge of football and the nfl
8434,that is good ! we are getting close to the super bowl !
8435,how familiar are you with the nfl ?
8436,"i like the denver broncos a lot . but there were many things i did not know , like that there is not a rule against female players !"
8437,i was surprised that the average nfl game only had 11 minutes of gameplay
8438,"that suprised me too , did you know what embedded chips are use for in the nfl ?"
8439,"i believe they embed chips into footballs to track velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location"
8440,"that is right , i think is great because that is how we get so much info on the performance . i had no realize the teams only rest one week during the season"
8441,"even when they play , there are chips in their shoulderpads to track their movement and gather data for better plays and understanding of football"
8442,"that is good ! i learned that there was a game back in 1916 and the score was 222 to 0 by georgia tech , isn't that amazing"
8443,another amazing fact is that benjarus green ellis never fumbled the football in his entire nfl career . both amazing incidents and people
8444,"that is true . something that i found really funny is that u of iowa locker room for the visiting team is painted in pink , i think that is a message"
8445,i wonder if there is a funny or interesting reason for this ?
8446,they want to intimidate the visitors ! an interesting fact is that there is only one left handed qb in the nfl
8447,"speaking of qb , quarterbacks are my favorite position in football since they are the core of the teams offence ."
8448,they are so important they are the leaders and they are the ones that call for the huddle
8449,did you know that signature circular huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback to prevent the other team from reading his hand signals ?
8450,i think that is so neat ! his name was paul hubbard
8451,"did you also know that tom brady , who has won the superbowl on several occasion , served as a backup qb and never got to play during highschool ?"
8452,that is hard to believe ! ! i found it really funny . well it was nice talking to you . . have a good one
8453,hello . are you familiar with the nfl ?
8454,"i am a fan , the chicago bears . you ?"
8455,i used to be a fan of 49ers . i lived in the bay area for 25 years .
8456,not any more ? did you move ?
8457,yes i did . i heard that nfl has no rule against female players .
8458,no rules against females ? that's interesting . where di you move to ?
8459,as long as they meet the league's eligibility requirements . it would not be easy even for physically strong men .
8460,i cannot believe the controversay clay matthews has brought on with all his roughing penalties .
8461,i did not answer your earlier question . i moved to a dallas suburb . i heard that clay was penalized for roughing the passer for a thirdquarter hit on redskins qb alex smith .
8462,yeah . he got two in the first few games and had to pull back the rest of the season . no worries about not answering the question . i didn't want to probe too much if you didn't want to answer . so are you a dallas fan now ?
8463,no . i have not been here very long . mathew apparently violated the directive that a defender cannot land on a quarterback .
8464,"as a bears fan , i was happy to see it ! did you know the nfl uses chips in sholder pads ?"
8465,yes i do . technology is used every where now .
8466,i know . i am a little worried about it . do you know who the only rocket scientist in the nfl is ?
8467,no . please tell me about it . is that alex smith ? he finished college in two years .
8468,"good guess but it's the lions coach , matt patricia ! alex smith is really smart though ."
8469,"oh , okay . thank you . do you know the strange rule related to the new orlean saints cheerleaders ?"
8470,i do not . what is it ?
8471,"cheerleaders cannot eat at the same restaurant as the players . if they are at the restaurant and a player or players come in , they have to leave ."
8472,that seems really sexist and incredibly inconvenient for the cheer leaders . what a terrible rule .
8473,"the rule needs to be changed , for sure . i've got to run . nice chatting with you ."
8474,hello ! do you like to watch football ?
8475,i sometimes watch football . you ?
8476,"yes same here ! i can't believe that in the 1960's , bowlers made more money than football players ."
8477,the football players might not have made much . it was a golden age for bowlers though . i guess i was born too late .
8478,are you good at bowling ? i'm terrible so i would have made less money playing football .
8479,i would have been terrible at both . i would have had a job painting locker rooms .
8480,would you paint visitor locker rooms pink like the iowa hawkeyes ?
8481,"i guess i would try it . if it worked on the other team , then i would sell my services to every team ."
8482,i feel a business plan coming soon ! i wish i was the one who created the yellow line in football games . espn won an emmy for that .
8483,i bet the person who came up with idea got a raise and a promotion . that was a good idea .
8484,i agree ! i like watching the nfl but i can't believe we really only watch 11 minutes of actual gameplay !
8485,i would just watch the highlights from the news . that would probably be enough . it is an expensive sport to watch .
8486,it really is . i do like the technology that the nfl has been using though !
8487,do you mean the chips that the players have ?
8488,yes those ! they can basically track players every moves and i think they do things with the footballs as well .
8489,that is great . i bet it helps coaches with strategy and the tv announcers with analysis .
8490,"when you watch instant replay , it all makes sense now . did you know there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl right now ?"
8491,that surprises me . where are all the others ? is that so unusual ? there are left handed pitchers .
8492,i wonder if there is a disadvantage ? i can name three lefthanded quarterbacks ever haha .
8493,there might be problems for the rest of the team to adapt to a lefty . i wonder .
8494,thats a good question ! well thanks for an awesome talk . have a good one !
8495,do you follow american football ? the cleveland browns will get a new coach at the end of this season .
8496,"wow ! there are only 32 nfl head coaching positions , so they're highly coveted . but then , it's the browns !"
8497,lets just hope next season is a better season than this past with coach hue jackson .
8498,"and lately baker mayfield has revealed the full extent of his sparkling potential . he was a first round pick , and is the rookie quarterback . with the right coach , maybe the browns can win some big games ."
8499,"well , they have a good quarterback , so that is a good start to winning games ."
8500,"on a recent sunday , mayfield led the browns to a 3520 victory over the cincinnati bengals . it's nice to win against another ohio team !"
8501,with mayfield as the quarterback i am not surprised the browns won . he is good and the quarterback position is involved so much in offensive play .
8502,indeed . and he's still just a rookie . did you know that when he was at the university of oklahoma he considered quitting to pursue fulltime competitive gaming ?
8503,"i wonder if he would have been good at it . there is money in the nfl , but your lifetime earnings are less than that other jobs , such as engineer ."
8504,"wow . probably less risk of injury as an engineer , too ? it's still a lot of minutes for just an average of 11 minutes of live gameplay , which is the average for an nfl game !"
8505,"as a woman i suppose i could technically be allowed to play in the nfl , but i don't think i have the talent . i don't think i have the patience to be a cheerleader because of their rules ."
8506,i know ! i heard that new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player ! that would not work for me !
8507,"and , you would have to find something to do the rest of the year , as the season is only 17 weeks ."
8508,"in the 1960s , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . i wonder how the salaries compare now ? learning to bowl might be cheaper than engineering school !"
8509,"well players have received degrees , so i suppose they could have a career after football ."
8510,indeed . i love to watch football on tv . especially since espn created the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games . they won an emmy for that ! do you like to watch football ?
8511,"there are many types of football , do you mean nfl american style , of what the rest of the world calls football but americans call soccer ? ."
8512,"good point ! i love to watch gridiron football , or american or canadian football , and i love rugby football , too . it's hard to believe football has been around so long . did you know there are references to it by indigenous people in many different parts of the world , even in prehistoric times ! ?"
8513,"there are so many types , but since i live where football is a regional word for the nfl style that is what i see . i am not surprised that it is a really old sport ."
8514,"there really are . iduring the 20th century , several of the various types of football became some of the most popular team sports in the world !"
8515,"in america it is been over a century of playing . the highest scoring game ever was long ago in 1916 , with a score of 2220"
8516,"wow ! 222 points in one game ! almost as bad as some browns losses ! maybe the winners heard the other teams play calls . . did you know the circular huddle teams use today was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback ? they used it so the other team could not read his hand signals ."
8517,maybe the new coach for the browns will help them to the playoffs and the superbowl this year .
8518,"i hope so ! the first thing any coach needs is a good quarterback , and like we talked about , baker mayfield is a good one ! and since quarterbacks are often responsible for calling the play and touching the ball on nearly every offensive play , he should have a big impact . a good coach and a good quarterback might finally get the browns to the super bowl ."
8519,cleveland can hope so ! thanks for talking football with me .
8520,do you watch the nfl ?
8521,yes all the time . did you know the women can play too ?
8522,yes there is no rule against that as long as they qualify
8523,yes i hope we get to see a coed game sometimes soon
8524,yes me too . did you know the game technically is only 11 minutes ?
8525,yes and we are glued to the tv for what feels like forever
8526,hahah i know . did you know engineers make more over the lifetime than nfl players ?
8527,yes but they also have longer careers so maybe that has an effect on the income
8528,true . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
8529,yes it is sexist and it has to go honestly . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
8530,hm i wonder if it is supposed to have some effect on them
8531,i wonder too . in the 60s bowlers made more money than football players
8532,wow i guess it was a much popular sport back in the day so that makes sense
8533,yes it is true . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
8534,"yes that was for the superimposed yellow line , what a feat"
8535,yes . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
8536,yes that is 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
8537,yes . do you know who benjarvus ellis is ?
8538,yes the rb that never fumbled the ball . do you like tom brady ?
8539,yes i do . in high school he was a reserve qb that was never started
8540,"they lost a great chance with him there , too bad for them"
8541,hello ! do you follow the nfl ?
8542,sure ! what do think of the cowboys acquisition of amari cooper ?
8543,it gave them someone they desperately needed after losing dez bryant .
8544,"that is for sure . cooper had a good run in his first years in the league , but his performance with the raiders has been lackluster as of late . i hope he can step it up with the cowboys !"
8545,yes ! i'm sure with the use of the tracking chips that they put in the players shoulder pads to record their every move he will start to work on his route running .
8546,makes sense . it seems like a lot of technology for a game that only has 11 minutes of actual ball play in the entire game .
8547,"that's awful short for the amount of money they get paid if you ask me . speaking of earnings , the average lifetime earnings of an average engineer are higher than that of an average nfl or mlb player ."
8548,"yeah , but they both eat well . that is not true for the cheerleaders ! besides watching their weight , some clubs , like the saints , prohibit chearleaders from dining in the same restaurant as the players . that can put a crimp in your diet !"
8549,that seems like an odd rule . i wonder if we'll see a female nfl player any time soon since there's no written rule agaist allowing them to play ?
8550,"yeah , it may be the only way the ladies can get a good meal ! the univ of iowa already has their visitors locker room painted pink , so we are getting close !"
8551,i wonder if that was for breast cancer awareness ? in the 1960's top bowlers made 2 times as much as the top football stars of the day . times sure have changed since then .
8552,"i'll say ! in the 1960s , there was no espn emmyawardwinning yellow line superimposed on the tv screen ! revolutionized the game for us armchair qbs !"
8553,yes it did ! i can't believe the score of the highest scoring game ever . georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 !
8554,"a lot has changed since 1918 when that performance made the record books , but it is nice to see a record like that still standing today !"
8555,that's just a crazy score . lol did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf qb so he could relay hand signals to the other players ?
8556,"nice ! and now the phrase , huddle up ' is known across the entire planet ! less known is that the only lefthanded qb in the nfl today is kellan moore . i miss john elway !"
8557,yes . that whole era when elway played seemed like it was better than now . the quarterback touches the ball on almost every offensive play and is the one responsible for always calling the plays in the huddle .
8558,"yeah , where are the modernday refrigerator perry type runners today ? there are some good ones , like benjarvis ellisgreen , the patriots runningback that never once fumbled the ball in his entire career , but it is hard to find a legend on the field these days !"
8559,that's a pretty impressive stat to have ! current browns qb baker mayfield almost quit football so he could pursue a full time competitive gaming career . sounds like that would have been a bit risky .
8560,"yeah , but it speaks toward the mentality of our youth . i could not imagine as a child if i had a chance to go outside and play football that i would have passed on it to stay inside and pretend to play football . i know mayfield is more of a halo 3 guru , but the i think you know what i am saying , right ?"
8561,yes i do know ! lol it was nice chatting with you !
8562,"hi , do you like football ?"
8563,no it seems to go on forever
8564,but it only has 11 minutes of playing time . . .
8565,yes and the season only goes on for 17 weeks but then they drag it on with all those ther competitions
8566,"the good news is that they now have a new league , the aaf . that starts after the nfl . you have to be even more excited now"
8567,"woo hoo , do you like football ?"
8568,i can feel the sarcasm . . . . i do . i also understand why people do not watch it . there is so much more to do on a sunday than watch football .
8569,back in the 1960s bowlers earned more than footballers how times change
8570,engineers now make more than the avg football players . seems like a poor decision to risk permanent brain damage .
8571,one player even considered competitive video games instead i wonder if they would make more ?
8572,"it wouldn't hurt as bad . plus mayfield was a great halo player , supposedly . . ."
8573,why is there only one left handed quarter back ?
8574,left handers throw a ball that rotates opposite of right handers and fade in the opposite direction . it is difficult to change and get comfortable with them .
8575,i never knew that
8576,i am full of useless sports knowledge .
8577,did you know already that iowas painted the locker room pink ?
8578,that's a weird choice of color . i wonder if it actually works ?
8579,what is it indended to do ?
8580,make the visiting team play softer . i do not think that would work on me .
8581,maybe they should of tried with georgia tech in 1916
8582,ha ! it was nice chatting with you !
8583,how are you today ?
8584,"hey i'm good , how are you ? are you a nfl fan ?"
8585,i am and am doing well thank you .
8586,are you an nfl fan ? familiar with nick foles at all and what an unlikely story he was ?
8587,"don't know a lot about him , whats the unlikely story about ."
8588,"well , the eagles were doing awesome with qb carson wentz and were favorites , but then he tore a knee ligament in week 14 and was out for the rest of the season"
8589,yeah that is a unlikely story . did you hear the iowa state visiting locker room is pink
8590,"no i didn't . that's pretty weird but probably messes with other teams heads . are you familiar with football , specifically the nfl ?"
8591,"to the best of my knowledge , don't get to watch the games as much anymore and was disappointed with the performances in the super bowl not necessarily the outcome ."
8592,"ah okay , so did you see when nick foles won the super bowl last year ?"
8593,honestly did not watch last years . was it a good game ? i hear the live action in the game is only about 11 minutes .
8594,it was pretty awesome to see a backup winning it . foles was confident though . i did know that . a lot of commercials and play calling .
8595,yeah i hear there going to start putting tracking chips on the players pads .
8596,"yeah , also inside the footballs . cool technology . i wonder if the quarterbacks care since they touch the ball so much ."
8597,"probably not , they got enough to worry about ! did you know that there was a time when bowlers made twice as much as top nfl players ?"
8598,"i've heard that before , that's crazy . but at the same , did you know the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than an nfl player ?"
8599,yeah you can't play pro football for 50 years . do you know what the highest scored college game was ?
8600,i know those games can out of control sometimes and be very high scoring or lopsided . tell me .
8601,it was georgia tech and cumberland the score was 2200 . cumberland lost . i would have hated to be on that bus ride home .
8602,"2200 , wow . i wonder if the cumberland quarterback did anything at all or did they just constantly turn over the ball ."
8603,"it was back in 1916 , things were a lot different then . hey i heard espn won an award ."
8604,yes . i know why . they added that famous yellow line that we now see on every game on tv for the 1st down marker .
8605,"that's right , i like that line it makes things much easier . nice chatting with you ."
8606,"hi . are you ready to talk about quarterbacks , national football league , and football ?"
8607,"yes , i love football , and enjoy going to the games ! !"
8608,i really love going to those live games where you can get the feel of the game . quarterbacks are my favorite . did you know that alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a junior and graduated with his bachelor's degree in two years ?
8609,he must be smart as well as talented ! ! maybe he has a photographic mind . . . . i do too like quarterbacks . do you like avocado ice cream like tom brady ?
8610,"yes , i've actually made it in my vitamix and it was good . you cannot taste the avocado in it . tom brady is smart like that . he's my favorite qb . i didn't know but recently found out that the qb is considered the leader of the offensive team and calls the plays in the huddle ."
8611,"yes , that's true and a deaf player started that huddle so the other team could not see the plays ! ! interesting . . ."
8612,"yes , that was paul hubbard , right ? he was the deaf player that created the circular huddle . cool ."
8613,"yes , i love tom brady too ! i got to see him this year at walt disney world after the game in the parade ! !"
8614,"wow , how lucky are you ? did you also know about former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis and that he never fumbled the football in his nfl career ? that's a unique attribute ."
8615,that is impressive for sure ! ! did you know tom brady's wife makes twice as much as he does ! lol
8616,"wow , that's a lot of money between the two of them . apparently , the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl or mlb player . engineers must make a lot of money ."
8617,yes they do ! ! did you know tom brady has never ate a strawberry ! not sure why ? thinking he might have allergies ?
8618,"yes , that would be a good reason not eat any . did you know that new orleans saint's cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player ?"
8619,"yes , that's a little outdated don't you think ? maybe they think there would be too much togetherness in the restaurant . they should let each other know beforehand where their going if its such an issue ! lol"
8620,"i didn't think about it that way , but you could be right , maybe it's an old rule still on the books . did you that the nfl has no written rule against female players ."
8621,"yes , i wonder how they would play against such big guys ? maybe the kicker position would be safe . at least they have the option , never know ?"
8622,"the problem is how could a woman meet the eligibility requirements , really ?"
8623,"lol , i agree ! did you know as far as losing games , the new england patriots and the buffalo bills are equal ?"
8624,"yes , i did just hear that . the new england patriots are doing way better since they just won the last super bowl though ."
8625,"that's true , after 16 seasons as starter tom brady has lead the patriots to 8 superbowls , more than any player in history ! !"
8626,"yes , what a great quarterback he is . nice chatting with you , have a good one ."
8627,"hello , are you a fan of football ?"
8628,love the football ! what's your favorite team ?
8629,i am not a hue fan ! i think teams like the rams and broncos are interesting though .
8630,benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the football in his nfl career . i wonder if he ever played against iowa state . their pink visiting team room might have affected him .
8631,"that's interesting , it must be difficult to never fumble the ball . did you know women are technically allowed to play in the nfl ?"
8632,i think that's great ! i wonder what position the first woman in the nfl will play . it's just a matter of time .
8633,"there is already some misogyny present in the league , such as cheerleaders in new orleans having to leave a restaurant if a saints player comes in after ."
8634,the hypermasculine nature of the sport makes that kind of bigotry inevitable . i think that they need to rethink the role of woman in the sport . i see more women on the screen as sportscasters .
8635,"absolutely . an nfl career itself may not even be as worth it as i thought . for example , the average lifetime earnings is much higher for an engineer than a football player ."
8636,we need engineers more than grown men playing with a ball . i wish we could inspire kids to study engineering .
8637,that is certainly fair . there is an interesting element of engineering in football ironically . shoulder pads and footballs have tracking chips inside of them for example
8638,i guess it helps understand things like injuries . it could also be used for strategy .
8639,"absolutely . however football could be more progressive , such as iowa's visiting locker room being pink ."
8640,i think that's meant to psych out the opposition . i wonder if it really worsk .
8641,"i doubt it really does , i would hope players aren't that fragile . i can't believe the highest score ever was 2220 though , that seems ridiculously high !"
8642,"didn't expect a tech school to play football well , but cumberland might have been tiny . i wonder what the spread was ."
8643,ahh i wonder if betting was even a thing back then . i suppose that isn't as bad as the jv football team that couldn't even score a touchdown the entire year .
8644,maybe those jv players would have been better off as engineers . or bowlers in the 1960s .
8645,"definitely , it's interesting how players think about other careers . such as baker mayfield considering choosing competitive gaming over football ."
8646,"fewer injuries , perhaps some interesting sponsorship opportunities ."
8647,"absolutely , but i'm sure most don't regret choosing football . it was nice chatting with you !"
8648,nice chat !
8649,"i can't wait for the superbowl this year . but , out of the 32 teams , my team isn't in it . do you watch the nfl ?"
8650,i like to watch and am also excited about the super bowl . i don't really get a chance to watch though .
8651,you may need your sunglasses if you watch the university of iowa and visit their pink locker room . that sounds really bright !
8652,yeah i was thinking about that . i assume it was to discourage the other team .
8653,lucky the football players didn't get discouraged in the nfl in the 1960's when bowlers made twice as much as the football stars
8654,yeah that was surprising to hear . it was unbelievable that they allowed a football game to continue with a score like 2200 . mercy ! !
8655,sounds like someone was taken advantage of ! they losing team sounds like they needed the former patriot benjarvus greenellis who never fumbled in his nfl career .
8656,"that or the fact there is no official rule that keeps women from playing football , they may have had a chance ."
8657,six teams make the playoffs from each conference . i wonder who will win the superbowl after these singleelimination games ?
8658,it will be interesting to watch . i can appreciate a young person who is also interested in their minds as well as sports . like alex smith who began working on his masters before becoming a first round draft pick in 2005 .
8659,paul d hubbard was amazing too in that he was able to quarterback being deaf . how did he know if people were going to sack him ? he even invented the huddle so other teams couldn't read his hand signals .
8660,yeah that goes to show you just cause circumstances seem intolerable there is always a way to overcome .
8661,too bad tom brady's high school jv team at junipero serra high school didn't think of something ingenious like starting brady ! they may have won a game or two .
8662,lol ! the average game only has 11 minutes of live game play
8663,i wonder how long baker mayfield would have to work if he chose fulltime competitive gaming instead of pro football . i guess more than 11 minutes .
8664,there is only one left handed quarter back in the nfl ; kellan moore .
8665,i wonder if that means he has a lot more natural talent because with all the technology they use is it geared to assist lefthanders ? considering that the quarterback touches the ball on almost all of the offensive plays that is quite a feat to be different !
8666,yeah when i played in high school the qb was left handed . it was awkward because the ball spent the wrong way
8667,"interesting to think about . i guess they don't have a quarterback in soccer , but only in american and canadian football ."
8668,technology has brought a lot of things a long way . i mean embedded tracking chips in shoulder pads to track players every move is kind of creepy .
8669,sounds like something from a 007 movie . maybe because of the engineering involved that is why engineers make more average lifetime earnings than that of an nfl player and mlb player !
8670,"greetings ! i don't know about you , but i'm not much of a football fan . that's if by ' football ' we mean american football . if it means soccer , then i'm a fan ."
8671,well i like football as an american haha . i don't personally like soccer but that's just me haha . do you have a favorite quarterback ?
8672,not really . but i did recently learn that the quarterback is considered the leader of the offensive team . i had thought the qb was in charge of the entire team .
8673,oh i didn't know that either . there's a quarterback in the nfl who's left handed . he's the only one . his name's kellen moore
8674,just one ? ! that's interesting . one of the trivia things i know about quarterbacks is that baker mayfield once thought about quitting football to become a professional gamer . i guess he's really good at halo 3 .
8675,"that's cool . i used to be really good at halo 3 as well haha . i can't believe those american flags at football games can cost up to 50 , 000 . i can think of a lot more cool things to make for that much money haha"
8676,"geez . there's so much money that goes into this sport , especially salaries . but get a degree in engineering and you'll make more money over your lifetime than if you're an average nfl player ."
8677,not a bad idea ! do you like snoop dogg ? i guess he wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team . that's pretty awesome
8678,ha ! somehow i can't see him as a father figure . but high school and earlier is where many of the great players got their start or tried . the jv team than tom brady played for in high school never used him one season .
8679,isn't that shocking . i wonder if a high school coach is kicking himself . but maybe tom brady wasn't so good back then . did you hear about the new high school football stadium in allen texas ?
8680,no . what about it ?
8681,"it cost 60 to make and can house 18 , 000 people . i just think that that money could be better spent somehow but what do i know"
8682,"60 ? ! are you sure about the amount ? but some facilities are interesting . for example , at the university of iowa the visiting team's locker room is painted completely pink ."
8683,oops it was 60 million dollars lol . stadiums are super expensive . 14 of the largest 25 stadiums belong to american football teams
8684,"i didn't know that . i wonder if any of those teams will one day have female players . i heard that nfl has no written rule against it , but women would just have to meet eligibility requirements ."
8685,you're right they don't have a rule against it . they also don't have a rule against tracking their players apparently they use chips embedded in the uniforms to track the players locations on the field
8686,"hmm . can't they just see them ? ! ; , it's amazing some of the technology that's used in games . espn , for example , won an emmy for creating that superimposed firstdown line we see on tv ."
8687,that is a genius invention though ! another genius is matt patricia . i guess he's a rocket scientist to also coaches in the nfl
8688,"i don't know about him . but i know some of the players really are smart , contrary to the stereotype . like alex smith , who finished his bachelor's degree in two years and was working on his master's degree when he was drafted by the nfl ."
8689,he seems really smart ! did you know that the first nfl playoff game was in chicago stadium back in 1932 ?
8690,"no , that's a new one on me . i wonder how many teams they had back then . it's 32 teams now , if i'm not mistaken ."
8691,i do think it's 32 right now . and yes chicago stadium is home to the chicago blackhawks actually they share a field
8692,do you like football ?
8693,yea the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements . i wonder why none have ever tried ?
8694,probably the thought of being a quarterback getting sacked
8695,its hard to say . did u know in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars
8696,no i did not know the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player or an average mlb player
8697,wow thats amazing . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . thats even more amazing to me
8698,exactly and during that time the nfl uses tracking chips to record players every move
8699,i read that the chips are in their shoulder pads . it's too technical for me .
8700,also located inside the footballs i had no idea
8701,seems a lot of time tracking stuff you know ?
8702,"yes they track velocity , ball speed , and location that's so interesting people really love football all around the world"
8703,heres a good one . the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220
8704,wow that's a big difference . must have been a really good team georgia tech had . like former patriots rb benharvus greenellis has never fumbled a ball in his career
8705,the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink
8706,so cute ! did you know saints cheerleaders are required to leave a restaurant if a player comes in after
8707,lol thats ridiculous i think
8708,isn't it . . . they are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant ever
8709,the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink
8710,yes very welcoming whenever there is a female player in the future
8711,lol i hear that lol
8712,good night !
8713,"hello , do you watch football ?"
8714,i sometimes watch football . you ?
8715,"same , although i do watch the superbowl every year ."
8716,i try to watch the bowl . i didnt get to watch it this year . i heard it was slow . last year was better .
8717,"yeah it was , the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
8718,that is a shame . the tickets are so expensive yet there is so little action . and no women in the game either .
8719,"speaking of women , there are actually no rules discriminating against them to play in the nfl ."
8720,"i figure eventually one of the teams will put a woman on the team , just for the publicity ."
8721,"hopefully , but they might get injured . football is known for its concussions !"
8722,"yes , boy , those are a problem at every level . maybe there should be high school girls teams first ."
8723,did you know that engineers make more in a lifetime than nfl players ?
8724,"yeah , that makes sense . longer career , rising salary , fewer concussions"
8725,and professional bowlers made twice as much as nfl players back in the 1960s !
8726,i wonder how much that actually was . probably pretty good for bowling . it was a golden age . the bowler had the perfect athletes body . lol
8727,it makes sense as football only started to grow roughly 25 years ago .
8728,"yes , it has grown tremendously . the first sb was like 53 years ago . not nearly as old as baseball"
8729,"there is also only one left handed quarterback in the nfl , kellan moore ."
8730,he is the only one ? i am surprised because there are so many left handed pitchers in the mlb .
8731,"yeah , because it is an advantage in the mlb . i guess it is not in the nfl ."
8732,"that could be the case . coaches might not want to have to deal with the wrinkles caused by a lefty . anyway , great chat !"
8733,"yes , have a good night !"
8734,thanks ! good night !
8735,you too !
8736,"i know little about football , but i know enough to say that tom and bill often deliver ."
8737,bill does seem to be quite the coach . i don't think he has been attached to a losing team has he ?
8738,what i also know from sport is that one game does not make a season . don't get worked up over one loss .
8739,very true . it seems like in football things can change in an instant .
8740,"i guess tom brady is considered one of the all time great , and he still keeps winning ."
8741,he is quite the player . people really seem to dislike him though .
8742,"again i don't really know enough but i suspect it might be jealousy . my understanding is that must have fixed things this year in the end , didn't they win the super bowl ?"
8743,yeah they did . it wasn't even really a game to be honest . they were ahead by so much that it wasn't fun to watch from what i've heard .
8744,i find it amusing that tom brady struggled to get on his high school team .
8745,that is hilarious . i bet that school is kicking themselves now .
8746,"maybe he was just a late bloomer , that might also be the reason he going on so long , isn't he near his forties ?"
8747,i think so . that could make sense . it has come a long way from that dirt field in the 30's
8748,"i wonder if the patriots can win again next year . there will probably be the same stories before hand , or if they lose a game or two , that tom and bill are done ."
8749,i think they are probably going to struggle . if they had lost one or the other it wouldn't be bad but both being gone is going to be rough .
8750,"i wonder how the boston area will honor them once they are done , some statues or a stadium name possibly ? there are probably lots of quarterback statues around the country ."
8751,i could see that . maybe they will rename some local stadium for them or something . they certainly have a complicated history .
8752,some controversy i believe . spygate and deflategate .
8753,i know about deflategate but i wonder what spygate was . probably them stealing plays or something .
8754,"probably , goes on in most profession sports . someone seen spying on to the team training , or something similar ."
8755,ah that would make sense . didn't really seem to wokr though with how behind they were before pulling out some wins .
8756,good talking to you . good bye
8757,hi there do you follow the nfl ?
8758,not too much . i think it's disgusting that the highest paid employees in the department of defense are football coaches .
8759,wow . they make more than the generals ? o
8760,"they do . maybe snoop dogg can write them a fight song , like he did for his son's high school team ."
8761,that's awesome ! what's not awesome is that the new orleans saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat at the same restaurant as any nfl player .
8762,"that's insane , and so sexist . why does a highschool need a 60 million football stadium ?"
8763,ahh . . . i've heard about that stadium . have you ever been to texas ? high school football is probably more popular than the nfl .
8764,"i have , and didn't care for it . i bet they have a few of those huge flags , that are over 50k ."
8765,yes i bet they do . the university of iowa's visitors locker room is painted pink . wonder why ?
8766,"intimidation , is my guess . it's probably very relaxing . is there really only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?"
8767,yes but i can't remember his name . do you know it ?
8768,i think it is kellan moore
8769,that's his name . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stores of the day .
8770,that is crazy . i guess there is a rocket scientist who is a football coach . his plays must drive the players crazy .
8771,that's interesting . bet he has some unique plays . did you know that espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line on tv ?
8772,that is insane . why do they put tracking chips in the shoulder pads of the players ?
8773,i am not aware of tracking chips ? former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the ball in his nfl career . nice job !
8774,they are also in the balls . i wonder why ?
8775,i have no idea . they must be there for a reason . lol the highest score ever for a football game was 2220 ! thanks for the chat !
8776,i think that was the georgia tech game . have a wonderful day .
8777,thanks you too .
8778,football fan ?
8779,"i like to watch it , but i am not a fan . did you know that espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed ?"
8780,"yeah , that's pretty cool . i wonder how that would have affected the highest scoring football game of all time . 2220 ."
8781,"i heard about it . think that was in 1976 , but i am not sure what happened ."
8782,1916 i think . georgia tech won .
8783,now i remember . in 1960 it was when top bowlers made twice as top football stars
8784,ah the halcyon days when bowling was lucrative !
8785,i know . do you know something about the football codes ?
8786,i know they're thinking of changing how they apply the ' roughing the passer ' penalty .
8787,ok . there are certain interesting thing about football like the fact that a university locker room is painted pink . don't know why .
8788,i think to intimidate them . pink being ' girly ' . that's dumb . who cares ? the nfl could have female players . there's no rule against it .
8789,could be .
8790,the nfl has tracking chips in the shoulder pads of players to track their movements on the field . kind of interesting .
8791,that's pretty interesting . i guess they want to track velocity and rotation and some other things .
8792,"yeah , interesting that they would get that deep into the weeds on it . i wonder if they do that in the other football games around the world , soccer , aussie rules etc . ?"
8793,how can they forbidden from eating in the same restaurant ?
8794,cheerleaders ?
8795,new orleans saints cheerleaders
8796,i don't know . that seems dumb . trying to dissuade fraternization or just really sexist ?
8797,i don't know why but it is too much . they are required to leave the restaurant if an nfl player comes in after
8798,"well , nice chatting . cya !"
8799,"hello , did you know that the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted all pink ?"
8800,no why would they paint it pink ?
8801,i guess so the opposing team would feel imasucated ? i don't know ! !
8802,"i don't know much about football . it must be popular , there is a lot of people interested in betting on games ."
8803,"are there ? i think it's illegal to bet on nfl games , but i'm not sure about college ."
8804,"after a new judgement , sports gambling is now allowed in any state . if you have too much money ."
8805,"i didn't realize that . . . i don't have too much money so i guess i won't be gambling , lol . i didn't realize women could play in the nfl if they wanted to !"
8806,"there should not be a rule preventing them to play , but i would not follow it more if they played ."
8807,"well , there is no rule but women do have to meet the league's eligibility requirements . maybe that's why we don't see any women ? but considering the an engineer earns more than the average nfl player , i would recommend higher education !"
8808,"oh i did know that , it seems that football is generating so much money that the players would be paid more than engineers . the highest paid employees in the department of defense are football coaches ."
8809,"wait a second , department of defense ? as in the military ? so the dod football coaches make more than say a sergeant major ? that's crazy ! ! but i guess the average coach makes millions a year . . . i dunno"
8810,"football is quite popular , games generate a lot of money , in texas there is a high school football stadium that can hold 18 000 people ."
8811,wow ! ! football is big in texas . . . and everything is big in texas . . . but wow ! ! did you know the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback ? he didn't want the other team reading his hand signals !
8812,"that is interesting , quarterbacks can be inventive , brad johnson is the only who threw a touchdown pass to himself ."
8813,"how did he pull that off ? tom brady was the backup quarterback in his hs , his team had such a bad season that they didn't win a single game or even score a touchdown ! yet they never put tom brady in ! !"
8814,"i don't know , maybe it has to do with who is the child of whom ."
8815,"good point , that was probably it . but still . . . that coach must have really disliked tom brady or his family to do that !"
8816,"there is a lot o money and prestige in football , 14 of the 25 largest stadiums in the world are college football stadiums , so politics are never far ."
8817,"that's very true . going back to women and football , the new orleans saint's chearleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player . so if they are eating and a player walks in the cheerleader has to leave !"
8818,"that is not fair , it puts down the cheerleader like a second class citizen ."
8819,"it does , hopefully the rule will change . i'm sure people don't follow it though . . . i hope . great chat !"
8820,do you watch much football ?
8821,"no , i don't watch football regularly , there is not enough action to keep my attention , there is only 11 minutes of gameplay in a match . and you , do you like football ?"
8822,i will watch it if it is on but i don't go out of my way to watch it . i think they focus too much on the qb both on and off the field .
8823,"yeah , i have heard all the drama about the contract of blake bortles and i don't even like the jaguars ."
8824,what happened with blake bortles ?
8825,"the jaguars could have hired kirk cousins , since he is a free agent , but they choose to stay with bortles and give him a 54 million contract ."
8826,wow that seems like an obscene amount of money . is that just for one season ! ?
8827,no until 2021 but it replaces the contract that he already has . it will be around 19 million per year .
8828,i can't see how anyone is that good of a qb to warrant that kind of money . imagine if they took that money and spread it around instead of concentrating on one player ? the game could be a lot more interesting .
8829,"that is also what the jaguars are doing they are full of young talents , they hope that bortles will stay good as the the young ones will get better ."
8830,i guess that is a decent stratedgy . i'm for it if it means the patriots get knocked down a peg or two . i don't even watch football that much and find them annoying .
8831,and to think that tom brady was benched for a season in high school . and it was a losing season for them too .
8832,he is a quality player but i think they have become the yankees of football . we have reached a point where sponserships and money have overridden what the game was intended to be .
8833,and what would improve the game ?
8834,i think if we were to focus more on what happens during the plays . use some of that info and footage from the chips in the uniforms and ball . imagine being able to see the ball go down the field from that perspective . also put caps on sponserships . of course treat the cheerleaders better is always top of the list .
8835,"i think cheerleaders are a relic of the past , and some teams are treating them like a relic of the past , they should be removed from the game and have their own competitive league ."
8836,those competative teams are amazing to watch . i would choose to watch that over a football game any day . plus they aren't just there to be eye candy for some slobbering men .
8837,"cheerleading is one the sports where there is the most injuries , therefore it is a legitimate sport . it is funny that it is considered a sideshow in football , another sport will lots of injuries ."
8838,there are so many injuries in football . i'm glad they are doing studies now on what the head injuries are doing to the players . it is so dangerous .
8839,"yeah , and they have chips in the players' equipment to monitor concussions . i hope it will help with the situation ."
8840,hopefully there are a lot of instances of post concussion rage that could be avoided if we can better protect the players .
8841,hi how are you ?
8842,just fine . are you a fan of football ?
8843,"i am , what about you ?"
8844,"yeah , there's a lot of interesting facts about the game . did you know there's only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?"
8845,"yes , kellan moore if i am not mistaking ?"
8846,"yeah , that's right . i bet it must be hard to defend against his passes , even with those tracking chips they have to wear ."
8847,they also put trackers in the footballs !
8848,"yeah , that's amazing what they can do . but hey they gotta have some way to enforce some of those wacky rules of theirs ."
8849,agreed and its funny how the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live play .
8850,yeah several hours on television and 11 minutes of play . pretty funny .
8851,that is ridiculous . i was unaware that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is more than an average nfl or mlb player .
8852,well the keyword there is lifetime nfl and mlb players can make absurd amounts per year but they usually don't play for decades .
8853,exactly ! if nfl careers were more than a couple years that statistic would not be true i am sure .
8854,yeah . there's also weird things about football like how saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player . that's bizarre .
8855,it is also weird and funny that iowas opposing teams locker room is painted all pink .
8856,yeah i guess that's to try to demoralize the opposing team . not that many people like pink .
8857,i am sure it probably works . other teams probably hate it .
8858,they do plenty of stuff just to throw off the other team . like how the huddle was invented to hide a deaf quarterback's sign language from the other team .
8859,that is interesting . did you know the highest score of a football game was 222 to 0 ?
8860,yikes . . . . i would not wanna be on the zero team . a sad sad day for georgia tech .
8861,seriously ! it was nice chatting with you !
8862,"yeah , thanks for the fun ."
8863,hey did you know the nfl uses chips to track the speed of footballs and the players ?
8864,i wonder if they use the data to make better plays and better understand football
8865,"ya that's a good question , i'm just glad they don't put those on civilians that would be really scary for the government to track you like that"
8866,i'm surprised that the nfl has only 11 min of actual gameplay
8867,"ha im surprised but not surprised , i don't like sports so i'm usually bored during games , and ya that kind of explains it haha"
8868,"while the nfl has no written rules against female players , it is a shame that some teams have biased rules such as the new orleans saints forbidding their cheerleaders from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player even if they came first"
8869,"ya that seems really weird , also weird is that bowlers used to make more than nfl players back in the 60's"
8870,do you like any positions in particular ?
8871,"can't say that i do , i do like quarterbacks though , i was happy tom brady won , what about you"
8872,i agree since the qb is the center of any offensive
8873,"i do like the patriots a lot , also that one player who has never fumbled the ball , i'd give him the ball every time !"
8874,i like kellan moore since his is the only left handed qb in the nfl
8875,"oh definitely ! isn't it crazy that the average engineer makes more than the average nfl player over their lifetime , seems silly !"
8876,well they probably have to work longer overall . many nfl players retire early due to injury
8877,"ya i think thats what happens , hopefully theyre careful with their money , isnt it wild that espn got an emmy for making the yellow line on tv for football"
8878,i think that is because in those 11 minutes of real gameplay so much goes on so any help to help digest the situation for the public regarding a popular sport is a plus and significant contribution
8879,"haha ya it must be , it's crazy the highest scoring football game was 2220 , i'd definitely have given up before then !"
8880,either the winning team had talent like green ellis or tom brady or the losing team were just that bad . perhaps it was both
8881,"haha i could see that , apparently it did happen in 1916 so it was a long time ago"
8882,i wonder if any other game came anywhere close
8883,ya i haven't seen such a high scoring game anytime recently thats for sure
8884,hello
8885,hey . are you into nfl football ? i like the manning brothers . i'm sad to see eli isn't quite working out for the giants .
8886,yes i love football . i am an eagles fan . i think eli manning is a great football player .
8887,agree . he works hard and has many touchdown passes without interceptions . sad that sometimes that isn't enough .
8888,yes i agree . plus the football players work too hard . six days a week for 60 minutes of football .
8889,yep . eli had a bad season in 2017 and was even benched for a game by coach ben mcadoo . must have been humiliating .
8890,that is humiliating . did you know that baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a fulltime job in competitive gaming ?
8891,"i can't see that paying . . . the saints sure have a good kicker in wil lutz . in one game he made 4 consecutive field goals of 42 , 34 , 37 , and 26 yards ."
8892,yes i agree . eli manning is a 37 year old quarter back so i believe there isn't much of a future .
8893,unless he's like brady . maybe he should start throwing to himself like brad johnson did for a touchdown in a superbowl .
8894,i didn't see that in the superbowl . did you know former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
8895,yep . pretty tight . i actually like college more than pro . i was surprised to learn that 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums are college .
8896,the nfl has no written rule against female players . i wonder if college football does ?
8897,"i think that's a schoolbyschool thing not the ncaa . college isn't as hightech . the nfl puts tracking chips on players to track their moves , velocity , rotation and location ."
8898,"yes , i agree . did you know the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?"
8899,i can believe it . i played in hs and there was a lot of standing around .
8900,"yes it is alot of standing around , but then goes to the opposite extreme of getting tackled ."
8901,yep . i was surprised to know that kellan moore is the only lefthanded qb in the nfl . i would think there would be more .
8902,wow . i didn't know that . did you know the university of iowas locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink ?
8903,that's funny . a funny as the nfl actually having a rocket scientist coach in matt patricia . it doesn't seem like a good fit for a coach .
8904,i agree . you think she would work for nasa .
8905,agreed . i wonder what their win loss record is .
8906,hello do you like football ?
8907,"i do , but not as much as snoop dogg ! he wrote a fight song for his son's football team ."
8908,thats pretty cool ! did you know theres no written law that women cant play in the nfl ?
8909,that's interesting . i did not know that . football does have a lot of rules for different types of football and have different football codes .
8910,"right . also , the nfl uses tracking chips to track the players and the football ! isnt that interesting ? !"
8911,so much data ! matt patricia must be good at interpreting data . he is the only coach in the nfl who is also a rocket scientist .
8912,"thats really cool , i guess football and physics have a lot in common . football is such a long game to watch , its like 3 hours long but only really 11 min in game play ."
8913,"that is a long time . baseball is also a long sport . nfl quarterback russell wilson is still under contract for baseball , despite not playing since 2011 ."
8914,thats interesting . i heard the university of iowa painted the opposing teams locker room pink lol
8915,that's funny . college football is big time . 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to college football teams .
8916,"yeah it seems like a lot of people put money into college football , thats crazy !"
8917,"speaking of money , did you know there is a high school football stadium in allen , texas that cost 60 million to build !"
8918,"omg , thats insane lol another fact that is crazy is there is a running back who had never fumbled a ball in his career !"
8919,that's hard to do ! do you know what else is hard to do in football ? throw a touchdown pass to yourself . brad johnson is the only quarterback in nfl history to throw a touchdown pass to himself !
8920,"wow , he must be a fast runner ! i wonder if theres a video of it lol"
8921,"i'd love to see that clip . speaking of football clips , jordan reed went viral for a clip of him doing yoga on the sideline ."
8922,i wonder why that is a big thing ? people have different ways of preparing for a game .
8923,that's for sure . whatever it takes to get ready . football season is grueling . the 17 week regular season runs from early september to late december with only one bye week .
8924,i recently read that the circular huddle used today was created by a deaf quarterback !
8925,"that's so cool ! the quarterback is the most important player , responsible for calling the play in the huddle ."
8926,"yeah , well its been good chatting , have a good one ."
8927,do you like sports ?
8928,no not really
8929,personally i like football
8930,i bet . i was going to ask you if you liked sports yourself . who is your favorite team ?
8931,i like the patriots . they are the lanisters of football
8932,cool .
8933,how familiar are you with football ?
8934,not at all .
8935,do you know about the nfl league and the positions in football ?
8936,i do not and i do not care to . do you ?
8937,personally i like the quarterbacks since they are the core of any offensive
8938,i know that the nfl was formed in 1920 .
8939,did you know an average game only has a dozen or so minutes of actual gameplay ?
8940,eleven average min .
8941,"in any case , that is much shorter than it feel considering it takes hours"
8942,"exactly , so why does it take so long ?"
8943,"a lot of prep , getting organized , planning , etc i guess"
8944,all that . thats why i dont really care . its pointless to me .
8945,"i can see your point , but i think of all the effort and prep that goes into making or breaking the game in those few minutes exciting . anyway thanks for chatting ."
8946,i guess . not for me . have a good day .
8947,the same to you .
8948,do watch washington football ?
8949,no
8950,apparently they rank fourth in the nfl in total rushing yards .
8951,not too shabby
8952,"it seems good , i don't pay a lot of attention to the stats though . do you ?"
8953,not very much either
8954,the nfl has no written rule against female players .
8955,so woman technically can play in the nfl if they were good enough
8956,"yeah , it appears so . but engineers on average make more than players ."
8957,engineers probably have longer career lengths
8958,"yeah , that is what i'm assuming ."
8959,caroloina is doing well also with 33 such plays .
8960,"interesting , apparently they put chips in the players shoulder pads ."
8961,the chips go well with ranch .
8962,interesting concept . i think they are trying to track plays .
8963,this is very fascinating
8964,"yeah , i'm sure they are running the numbers on something ."
8965,also funny that the cheerleaders cant dine at the same place the players do .
8966,"yeah , that is a rule that a lot of teams have i think , not just the saints ."
8967,very interesting information
8968,apparently iowa's locker room is painted pink for visiting teams . hilarious .
8969,and top bowlers in the 60s bowlers made more money
8970,"yeah , i know . i'm not a bad bowler either ."
8971,are you a bills fan ? my son is a huge one !
8972,can't say that i am actually haha . i don't really watch sports . how often do you watch the nfl ?
8973,"quite a bit . i have 2 boys ! the bills always have an issue at quarterback , that is why their season isn't the greatest . i am surprised that they benched peterman and started allen . . . but they don't always do what i think they should ."
8974,haha yeah i can see that . did you know the nfl uses tracking chips . they put it in the shoulder pads . that would scare me if they could players off the field haha
8975,yes ! and in the footballs ! that is crazy . they are trying to register everything that happens . i guess that is what happens when you are paying somebody big money !
8976,haha yep i agree . did you know that there is a coach in the nfl that's actually a rocket scientist ? his name is matt patricia
8977,no way ! i had no idea . the one thing that i have heard is that it is better to be an engineer than a nfl or mlb player . much more earnings !
8978,yep you're right ! did you hear about the first nfl playoff game ? it happened back in 1932 on an 80yard dirt filled back in chicago somewhere haha
8979,i didn't but i did hear about how the new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden to eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and they have to leave if one comes in . that is too much !
8980,"i know isn't that weird ! you would think in this day and age that that wouldn't be necessary . if i were them i would be really upset , are there any quarterbacks that you like ?"
8981,yes . i do like tom brady . . . even though there are the haters out there . with his record ! who couldn't be a fan .
8982,yep i agree ! i think he's the best too ! what do you think about kellen moore ? he is the only lefthanded quarterback in the entire nfl apparently
8983,i heard about that . did you know that tom brady's high school football team never played him . even though they had the worse season where they never won a game or even scored a touchdown .
8984,"no i didn't know that . that seems very silly . although i wonder if he got better or if his coach was just stupid haha . did you hear about the guy who threw a touchdown pass in the super bowl , to himself ?"
8985,no ! ? i didn't . that would have been something to see . i heard that baker mayfield the quarterback for oklahoma considered quitting to be a competitive gamer . video games . do you think there is any money in that ?
8986,no i don't think so . at least not a lot anyway . i think you made the right choice ! what's weird to me is that only two africanamerican quarterbacks have won the superbowl . i wonder why that is
8987,not sure . but the huddle was created by a man who was deaf and did not want the other team to read his signals .
8988,that is really interesting . another interesting fact is that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team . what a nice dad
8989,love that ! great talking to you ! have a good night .
8990,"you too ! and make sure to check out the football stadium in allen , texas , it cost over 60 billion dollars to build !"
8991,absolutely .
8992,hello do you follow the nfl ?
8993,"i do follow the nfl yeah , i like it , 32 teams , 16 on each divicision , do you have a favorite team ?"
8994,i do . i like the steelers . i watch all 16 games they play each year .
8995,"i dont follow all the games , mostly the playoffs or in the superbowl , did you watch the superbowl this year ?"
8996,i did ! it's usually held on the first sunday in feb . every year . i was rooting for the patriots .
8997,"i was rooting for the patriots as well , good thing we won , although it was a boring superbowl , it needed more action"
8998,i did . i wonder if we'll ever see any female players any time soon since there's no rule that doesn't allow them to play .
8999,"i dont think i will see that happen , seems like they would be at a dissadvantage"
9000,i was thinking maybe as a kicker ? did you know they put tracking chips in the shoulder pads and balls now to record data ?
9001,"yeah , that could be a good position yeah , and i wonder what kind of stats are taken out of them , seems really advanced"
9002,almost too advanced if you ask me . maybe the chips in the balls are attracted to the chips in the shoulder pads of the wide receivers so the ball will go to them ? lol
9003,"thats a funny theory , could be i wouldn discard it"
9004,lol did you know that the average career earnings of an engineer are more than that of an average nfl or mlb player ?
9005,"i didnt know that , wow , that is so crazy pro players earn so much money thats hard to imagine"
9006,i know . i don't know how they blow through their money like they do . i think they get paid too much for only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay per game .
9007,"only 11 minutes , but still its a game with lots of risks , players end with brain damage and thats a sad thing"
9008,yes . i agree . did you know that the circular huddle that we know was invented by a qb who was deaf so he could relay the plays to this teammates through his hands ?
9009,"wow he sure left a legacy behind , that was a clever move , i wonder if they won a superbowl"
9010,i'm not sure . there is only 1 left handed qb in the nfl kellan moore . are you familiar with him ?
9011,"only one , i think he retired already"
9012,i think so . i'm not familiar with him . it was nice chatting with you !
9013,case keenum lined up a deal with the broncos and will become their new starter
9014,"really , good for him . he was regarded as the consolation prize in free agency for teams that needed quarterbacks ."
9015,this is keenum's 4th team . he did really well in 2017 with the vikings
9016,"since we are talking about football , did you know that a female could play in the nfl . there is no written rule against it ."
9017,i've heard that . did you know an average nfl game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
9018,that is crazy . i found it unbelievable that the average lifetime earnings on an nfl or mlb player is less than that of an engineer .
9019,yes . alex smith was very intelligent and entered university as a junior and worked on a masters degree before becoming the first 2005 nfl draft pick
9020,"man , athletic and smart . that's not fair . did you know that the new orleans saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as the players . even worse , if they are already there and players come in , they have to leave . sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen ."
9021,"i wonder how that can be legal ? interestingly , the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink ."
9022,that is hilarious . i find it weird that there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl . it is kellan moore .
9023,i didn't know but 1960's top bowlers made 2x's the amount of top football stars
9024,not so anymore . do you know the reason they use the circular huddle today . it was started by a deaf quarterback named paul d . hubbard . he needed a way to block the other team from seeing his signals .
9025,interesting . the junipero serra high school probably regrets now that they lost every game and never used their player tom brady who is a 4 time superbowl champ
9026,that coach must suck . i learned that georgia tech beat cumberland 2200 for the highest score ever .
9027,that's insane . sounds like they should have shown more mercy . espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line for the first down in football games in america
9028,i did not know that . i did know that there are chips in the shoulder pads of nfl players to track players every move on the field .
9029,"yes , and also former patriot rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled in his nfl career"
9030,"man , he must have great hands . going back to the chips , there is one in the football itself . this is to track speed , rotation , and location ."
9031,that seems too robotic . changing the game a bunch .
9032,"i know , but they get data on everything . i heard the quarterback of the university of oklahoma , baker mayfield considered becoming a competitive gamer and quitting football ."
9033,he claims to be able to beat anyone at university of oklahoma oneonone in halo 3
9034,"do you like football , the nfl ?"
9035,"yes , but i do have to admit that i watch more ncaa ."
9036,"it can be more exiting than the pro league , im tired of the patriots winning all the time"
9037,much agreed there . did you know tom brady did not even get a chance to play when he was on jv
9038,"i didnt know that , why didnt he get a chance , his the best qb ive seen"
9039,even at age 40 he is really outplaying guys half his age . but it helps tha the has solid players like greenellis on his team
9040,"yeah he is sure a leyend , 40 years old and still has a great dertemintion , i have to give him that , and green ellis was a great rb also , never fumbled the ball"
9041,they are definitely making more than stars in the 60's did . then there were paid the same as top bowlers .
9042,"yeah i dont see bowlers making a lot of money these days , they used to earn more that pro football players"
9043,"espn won an emmy for the yellow line , i didnt even know there was a category for such a thing ."
9044,"i did hear about that , it was suprising to me as well but i think the creation of the yellow line changed the game forever"
9045,"especially for the home viewers . made things a lot easier , and the game easier to understand ."
9046,"i agree easier to understand i think its great how tech is taking over the game , allows the user to enjoy it more like those tracking chips"
9047,that can also help keep the players safer too .
9048,"i heard some of the rules are changing so maybe with the help of the chips that can happen , sad to see many players ending with brain damage"
9049,"very true , at least these could measure possible concussions and they could immediately evaluate them and take them out to rest if they have one ."
9050,"there is a chip also on the football all kinds of cool stats are taken out of them , like velocity , rotation speed , location of the ball"
9051,i wonder if they can use those for reviews ? it would certainly speed up the game .
9052,"i think they do , they take the stats such as running time and all and that might help , do you know the new orleans saints ? they have this crazy rule against cheerleaders"
9053,yeah i heard . i cant believe they have to leave just because a player walks in .
9054,"yeah that is really unfair and sexist , that rule should be banned"
9055,"much agreed ! its been great chatting , but i must go . have a great day !"
9056,"engineers earn more than football players overall , and yeah its been nice to chat as well"
9057,hey there do you ever watch the nfl ?
9058,"yes , do you ?"
9059,"yes i do , would you watch it if it had female players ?"
9060,"yes , i would that would be interesting ."
9061,"ya apparently there is no rule against it , and so they would actually be allowed to play !"
9062,"agree , did you know the first playoff game was played in 1932 in chicago stadium ."
9063,"no i didn't , i also didn't know there were 32 different nfl teams"
9064,"yes , how about texas being a big football state ."
9065,"oh it definitely is , what is crazy to me is that an average nfl game only has eleven minutes of live playing , the rest is just nonsense haha"
9066,"lol , they have a high school football stadium that cost 60 million to build !"
9067,"wow that is a lot , did you hear how the huddle was invented btw ?"
9068,"no , how ?"
9069,"yup created by a deaf quarterback , he used it to hide his hand signs from the other team"
9070,"interesting , i also find it interesting there is tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads that record their every move ."
9071,"ya that is kind of scary , also scary is that the university of iowa painted the oppsing locker rooms pink , id be mad haha"
9072,"yes , its hard for me to believe the stadium flags weigh 1 , 100 pounds . wow !"
9073,"that is a ton ! do you like the patriots btw ? they have a running back that has never fumbled the ball , ever !"
9074,"i love the patriots ! , and those flags cost 50 , 000 to make !"
9075,"that's insane ! i guess bowlers used to make twice what football players made in the 60's , so they couldn't afford that back then"
9076,"yes , its great to know that america"
9077,do you ever watch football on tv ? espn won an emmy for creating that yellow line they use during games
9078,"are you an nfl fan ? if so , do you remember reggie bush ? i just learned that the rams were ordered to pay him 12 . 5 million for his injury in 2015 ."
9079,"yes , i do enjoy nfl and remember reggie bush , but i don't remember what happened ? was it the fault of the rams that led to his injury ? 12 . 5 million is a very expensive injury !"
9080,yeah he was pushed out of bounds onto some concrete that ringed the field . that's why the rams were sued 7 . 5m in punitive damages .
9081,"wow ! i don't remember that injury , did that injury end bush's career or does he still play for the rams ?"
9082,not sure . i know it was season ending . the rams maintained that getting pushed out of bounds is just part of the game and it's how he got so far onto the concrete . they lost that argument .
9083,"bush is one of the most talented running backs in my opinion and the rams should have made it a safe environment for him to play , however , i think the players should already know the risks involved for playing such a physical sport , do you play football ?"
9084,"yeah , it sounded like kind of a freak thing . . . did you know the nfl has no written rule against female players ?"
9085,no i didn't know that but i would imagine the females would have to be in great shape to withstand the physical impact of very heavy and muscular linebackers .
9086,"yep . to answer your question , i played football in hs . many moons ago . . . i'm also an engineer but i find it hard to believe that my average lifetime earnings are more that that of an nfl player ."
9087,"haha , i agree , i also find that hard to believe although it does seem like engineers make a lot but i always hear about football players making millions and millions of dollars , i don't think engineers paychecks are quite that lucrative . unless they use those tracking chip data to negotiate better contracts and salaries ?"
9088,no such luck . my alma mater ran up the score of 2220 on cumberland in 1916 . can't say i'm proud of humiliating another team like that .
9089,"that is embarrassing for both parties , at what point do you just call it quits ? maybe they should've use the tactic that university of iowa deploys in the visiting football teams locker room and painted in completely pink to intimidate them or something . would that work ?"
9090,"i heard they do that to jail cells too , pastel colors , . something about a calming effect . speaking of paychecks , in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as football stars . also hard to believe . . ."
9091,"it's a calming effect , i thought it was to get into their minds or something . i find that hard to believe , but i also don't think bowling exists anymore , or at least i don't think quite as many people watch it as football which is considered america's pastime and in some places , called rugby . i wonder if females are permitted to play in those ."
9092,i don't watch it . also hard to believe that there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay . there is a lot of standing around but i think it's more like 30 minutes of live action .
9093,"only eleven minutes of live gameplay and yet i devote an entire afternoon and evenings watching those games . i never noticed that about kellan moore , he's the only lefthanded quarterback in the league , do you think that is an advantage or disadvantage if at all ?"
9094,no kidding . . . the game takes about 3 hours . i would think that by sure odds there would be more lefthanded qbs .
9095,interesting to see how the circular huddle still in use to this day was actually created by a deaf quarterback who didn't want the opposing team to read his hand signals . that's quite impressive .
9096,that is amazing . also amazing it qb alex smith who took so many ap tests in hs that he began college as a junior . smart dude . . .
9097,"not only does he have talent , but he also has brains ! i think he even went on to get a master's degree or something , i would think not very many players would value education once they're faced with million dollar contracts , would you ?"
9098,i would go for the money . one can always go back to school . you've been an excellent chat partner . thanks .
9099,are you a fan of the nfl ?
9100,"i am a fan of the nfl , 32 teams so far right ?"
9101,"yeah , i think there are 32 . there is only one left handed qb though ."
9102,"only one in the 32 teams ? that is odd , who is he ?"
9103,"yeah , kellan moore ."
9104,do you have a favorite player in the league ?
9105,"no , he's retired . what about you ?"
9106,"i do , mine is brady , i also like barke mayfield , both are great"
9107,the patriots ?
9108,"yeah brady from the patriots , his my favorite player"
9109,"brady is good , may be the best qb of all time ."
9110,"i agree , to me he is the best , at least the best ive seen , a game of football only has 11 minutes of live gameplay isnt that crazy !"
9111,i'm not a fan of the patriots though . there was some news recently of their owner engaging in prostitution i was surprised to learn he did that .
9112,"he does ? that doesnt seem appropriate for the public , that disgusts me , still like the team though"
9113,he just got arrested for it .
9114,"its a good thing it happened after the super bowl , a scandal like that can affect the team for sure"
9115,"it is a kind of a scandal . it happened in florida , all over the news ."
9116,i have to watch the news more often then ! ! how many years did he get or just community service ?
9117,i don't know . it literally happened last friday .
9118,"he is a public figure so they might make an example out of him , did you know about the saints and the rule they have against cheerleaders ?"
9119,"yeah , they already did by embarrassing him ."
9120,"hi , how are you ?"
9121,"hey i'm good , is there a favorite quarterback of yours that you like ?"
9122,i like jay cutler . what about you ?
9123,"ya i like tom brady myself , have you seen the video of him kissing his kid ? its really weird haha"
9124,"ha ! yes , i have seen that . he seems like a weird dude . who doesn't eat strawberries ?"
9125,"haha i know right ? also weird , kellan moore is left handed , the only one in the nfl"
9126,tom brady didn't even play on his high school jv team . . .
9127,"oh wow didn't know that , also didn't know there's no rule against women players in the n . f . l ."
9128,alex smith is so smart he entered college as a junior ! i barely graduate hs . . .
9129,wow thats genius ! strange to me that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of gameplay though
9130,i am a bears fan and it seems like the game lasts so much longer than that .
9131,"ya it seems like it right , did you hear about the controversy with the saints cheerleaders ?"
9132,"no , what happened ?"
9133,"ya they cant enter a restaurant if there is a saints player there already , it seems really outdated"
9134,"yeah . and if that is the rule , it should eb whoever got there first gets to stay ."
9135,"yup , or if anything neither person should have to leave that is just a dumb rule"
9136,there is no written rule against women from playing though . just eating at the same restaurant . . .
9137,"i know right , did you see too the nfl uses tracking chips on the field ?"
9138,i hope they use the data to make the game safer . . . it only has 11 minutes of playing time so let's make them safe .
9139,"haha i know right , but ya they can track player movement as well as ball rotation , pretty cool !"
9140,nice chatting with you !
9141,do you like football ?
9142,"yes , especially college . i went to an acc conference school . ed oliver recently single game record"
9143,for which team ed oliver plays ?
9144,i think he's a nose guard for houston . navy prepared an offensive game plan just to counter him .
9145,"i don't follow much college football , there are so many teams , even the army and the navy have one . what do you like about college football ?"
9146,it's kids that aren't getting paid a billion dollars and don't kneel during the anthem . it's fun to watch the qbs like alex smith .
9147,"the nfl has changed a lot , in the 60s pro bowlers were paid more than pro footballers ."
9148,"yeah , that won't happen again . so much funny stuff happens in college football . like the u of iowa makes visiting teams use a pink locker room ."
9149,"but there are stills injuries in college football , don't you think it is an issue with the sport ?"
9150,"it's an issue with any sport , e . g . , tennis elbow , . it's getting more hitech to prevent that and improve performance . the nfl uses chips in shoulder pads"
9151,"but football is more demanding physically on the players , that is why there are only 16 games per seasons in the nfl ."
9152,we've turned into a nation of wussies . i hope we don't get into a real war like wwii . football is ok if you're in shape like aaron donald .
9153,"a strong body is important , but a strong mind is better , baker mayfield wanted to be a professional video game player , because nobody could beat at halo , he would not have lasted long in the nfl ."
9154,"yeah , we are a nation with strong thumbs . i'm not sure video games build an intellect . football requires a strong mind and body . alex smith got his bachelors in two years ."
9155,"but being drafted first he knew he was good and team wanted him , i think most of the football player would cut short their education to be drafted in the nfl , there are only 32 teams ."
9156,i would . the opportunity cost is too high . unless you are in one of the academies like the navy . they lose a lot because of the rigors of football with the rigors of the academy .
9157,"and the average lifetime earning of a pro footballer is not that high , it is less than the average of an engineer ."
9158,"i'm having a hard time believing that . i mean a guy like oliver . if he can make investments at all , i ain't seeing it . surely that doesn't include coaches like niumatolo who would make millions in the nfl ."
9159,"most of the players don't have multimillion contracts , and people work till at least 65 , and engineers have their highest salaries in their later years ."
9160,engineer salaries plateau . . . i know from experience . i went to georgia tech and i can believe they once ran up a score of 2220 against cumberland . little ashamed . . .
9161,"at least they have a record , but not a good one . thanks for the conversation ."
9162,are you a football fan ?
9163,"yes , i am , are you ? in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as football stars ."
9164,i am . wow . times have certainly changed or
9165,yes they have . how about that score of 2220 in 1916 with georgia tech defeating cumberland .
9166,i didn't know about that . how does a team even score that many points during one game ?
9167,i don't know ! that was in 1916 ! i would think would stop at some point .
9168,you would think so . did you hear what the university of iowa did to the visiting team's locker room ?
9169,"yes , painting it pink ! not sure how much would affect the game . more of a joke ."
9170,seems to be . some kind of mind trick . did you also know that espn invented the yellow line that we see on tv marking the first down ?
9171,they won an emmy for that ! pretty good benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football .
9172,that's very impressive . wasn't he a patriots rb ?
9173,"i thought so , 11 minutes is the average play game !"
9174,"how is that possible ? i knew there were a lot of commercials , play reviews , flags , and such but wow that's very little ."
9175,seems like its more than 11 min . but they say the average . there's no rule against women players in the nfl .
9176,i did not know that either . with the size of the men on field it would be difficult . i can certainly see a female kicker .
9177,"yeah , maybe the kicker , if she's good . engineers lifetime earnings are higher than a nfl player !"
9178,oh wow ! i would definitely rather be an engineer then . it's much easier on your body .
9179,"yes , not worth all the damage and pain you'll get when you get older . hobbling around with bad knees etc ."
9180,i agree . did you know that in the nfl there are tracking chips in the players shoulder pads and in the football ?
9181,"yes , that's got to be helpful . i wonder if that helped with the inflated football ? good chat ! !"
9182,"ha ha , not sure . i do wonder why they don't use them instead of just reviews for play calls if that have that data ."
9183,hello . are you a big football fan ? i can't wait for the nfl to start again .
9184,"i love the nfl , i cant wait either ! which of the 32 teams is your favorite"
9185,"i used to be a rams fan until they moved but now i lean towards the ravens . i really like their quarterback , lamar jackson ."
9186,he is good and so fast ! what do you think about the saints ?
9187,"i think they are exciting to watch , but don't particularly agree with their treatment of their cheerleaders . did you know that saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player , and if they are already eating and a player walks in , they are required to leave ?"
9188,"i did not know that , it seems like it is sexist ! they need chips put in them apparently , just like nfl shoulder pads have"
9189,"it's amazing the technology that goes into nfl equipment . there's great engineering . speaking of engineers , the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player . crazy !"
9190,they are worth every penny ! did you know in the 1960s bowlers made more money than nfl players . they have come a long way !
9191,"that's crazy . things have really changed in the game . it's hard to believe , but one college football game in 1916 had a score of 2220 . times have really changed !"
9192,"i heard about that game , who played ? i would have quit at 1000 lol"
9193,"i definitely would have given up at 1000 ! i wonder how many quarterbacks they used . junipero serra high school jv football had a historically bad season where they never scored a touchdown , yet never attempted to start their backup qb . the backup just happened to be tom brady !"
9194,"what ! ! ! ! imagine if tom brady played for that team , they would have won 222223 ! that is awesome . are you an alex smith fan ?"
9195,yeah . i hope he recovers from his injury . he's a really smart quarterback . he entered college as a junior because he took so many ap classes . that is one smart guy !
9196,yea he is so smart ! i think he got his first degree as a sophomore in college ! then became the 1 pick !
9197,"baker mayfield was the first pick last year , but applied himself a bit differently . he once considered quitting football to go into competitive gaming . that's crazy . do you have a favorite quarterback ?"
9198,"wow , i heard he liked halo 3 . i could beat him ! i liked michael vick back in the day . he was my favorite lefty quarterback , you ?"
9199,there's not many lefty quarterbacks . kellan moore is the only lefty in the nfl now .
9200,"wow , i did not know that . quarterbacks must be a right handers game ! do you watch college football much ?"
9201,a little . i actually used to work in college athletics . there are some interesting things about college football . the visiting locker room at the university of iowa is painted completely pink . there's so many strange things about football !
9202,"i live down the street from that stadium . it is so interesting , it is used to psych out the other team ! good chatting with you !"
9203,good chatting with you ! wave at the kids in the hospital for me !
9204,hey there who is your favorite quarterback ? i know that i like tom brady a lot cuz he wins all the time haha
9205,"for all time it would be johnny unitas . now , it's mahomes . i do respect alex smith a lot ."
9206,"yeah alex smith seems really smart . he was working on his master's before he finally was drafted , and he passed out of a lot of college classes due to his high school ap scores"
9207,i do admire that . i used to play in hs and i never knew the circular huddle was created for a deaf qb .
9208,no i didn't know that either . he used the huddle to block the other team from seeing his hand signals which is actually genius
9209,also something to be admired . . . did you know that kellan moore is the only lefthanded qb in the nfl ? he's dallas right ?
9210,"i think so . and yes that is crazy , it's also crazy that baker mayfield was going to be a professional video game player back in the day lol he definitely made the right decision playing for the nfl"
9211,"yeah , did you hear that the u . of iowa has a pink locker room for the visiting football team ? does that work ?"
9212,"yeah i wonder if that increased or decreased their winning percentage ? i also wonder why bowlers were paid more than top football players back in the sixties , bowling must have been very popular back then"
9213,i think it was . i can't see how that could be considered a better spectator sport . i went to georgia tech and i didn't know we beat poor cumberland 2220 in 1916 .
9214,"haha that's funny ! that's such a blowout i feel bad for cumberland . i also think it's interesting that espn won an emmy for creating the yellow line that you see when you watch a football game on tv , it's a very genius invention"
9215,i love that yellow line ! it makes the game more exciting . i can't believe the former pat greenellis never ever fumbled in the nfl .
9216,yeah that's a very impressive statistic ! what do you think of the nfl by the way ? did you know that female players are actually allowed to play ?
9217,i like the chiefs . yes i did know that . there will probably be a female kicker before too long . i heard that there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay in an average nfl game . that seems way short . . .
9218,"i agree that does seem short . and i also think it's weird that an engineer will make more in his or her lifetime than an nfl star , that doesn't seem right but also i guess nfl players don't play for their entire lives"
9219,"yeah , i am an engineer and that's the only thing that makes sense . maybe one can be both , testing chips in shoulder pads ?"
9220,yes you should be an engineer for testing shoulder chips and also an nfl player to maximize your income haha ! its crazy the stats they can get from those small chips these days
9221,ha ! i could do the chip thing maybe but i would die on the field . i'd rather hang with the cheerleaders which would be frowned upon in new orleans .
9222,"yes i agree , but it is silly how the cheerleaders would have to leave a restaurant if you walked into their lol that definitely seems sexist these days"
9223,"yeah , i can't even see a high school requiring that . c'mon these people are grown ! you are an excellent chat partner , thanks !"
9224,thank you you are as well ! and definitely keep your engineering brain working on some more tracking chips because the nfl will buy them !
9225,"hey there , are you into football at all ?"
9226,i am although i do not watch it all the time . did you know that snoop dogg wrote fight song for his son's football team ?
9227,"no , i didn't . but that seems like something he'd do . he seems to be a great father , in my opinion ."
9228,"yep , any parent who has time time to write a song for their children is very dedicated ."
9229,"oh here is an interesting factoid about football . the circular huddle used in today's american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf qb , so the other team couldn't read his hand signals ."
9230,really ? that is super smart . there are also tracking chips placed into the nfl uniforms to track player movement . that sounds super advanced
9231,"yeah i heard somewhere that they have tracking chips in the footballs too , i believe ."
9232,the tracking chips in the footballs are apparently used to track its velocity and rotations .
9233,oh that's really high tech ! baker mayfield a qb for the university of oklahoma once considered quitting football to pursue full time competitive gaming . haha ! he claims he can beat anyone at the university of oklahoma at halo 3 !
9234,haha . i would like to challenge him . 14 out of the worlds largest stadiums are american football ones ! they are ginormous !
9235,"oh yeah and somewhere i read that the american flags in those stadiums are like over 1 , 000 pounds and cost 50 , 000 to make . that's nuts !"
9236,"i know right ? 50 , 000 dollars can buy you a luxury car ! why would they spend that on a flag ?"
9237,"i don't know , but it drives me nuts thinking about all that i could do with that money !"
9238,"same . furthermore , a high school football stadium in allen , texas costed more than 60 million dollars ! i think that that is more than the budge of our entire school district for the next decade combined !"
9239,"yeah imagine how many cars you could buy with that ! heh . so , the junipero serra high school jv football team recorded a historically bad season , when they failed to win a game or even score a touchdown yet they never attempted to start their backup qb , who happened to be tom brady ! 4 time superbowl champion ! crazy !"
9240,"i know , crazy right ? the highest paid across all of the us departments of defense employees are three football coaches ."
9241,"wow football coaches that are us department of defense employees ! weird ! so , i'm thinking that they get paid quite well ! the highest score ever , in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 . how is that even possible ! crazy big loss !"
9242,imagine losing that badly . kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl .
9243,"interesting ! i could be wrong , but i thought i'd recalled hearing somewhere that left handed people are more likely to play sports or something like that . i'd be interested to look at those stats again . that's an interesting topic to me . i'm righthanded . what about you ?"
9244,"i am also right handed , although most people are right handed . personally i find being left handed would be a disadvantage as most mouses are for only right handed people"
9245,oh that would be a pain to deal with . also those people that can use both hands ! i wonder if some can use them both equally as good ! that's very interesting ! and what if any difference is there between those people versus just right or left handed people . are they average or are they twice as good at everything ? haha . it's been fun talking with you ! thanks for the great conversation !
9246,agreed . thank you for your time and have a nice night !
9247,"alex smith to the redskins ! if only i knew the significance of that , are you able to enlighten me ."
9248,"haha ! he was a long time qb for the chiefs , but they did not want to pay him . he wound up being traded to the redskins and signing a 94 million extension !"
9249,i think i'd be reluctant to pay him at that rate . i hope the redskins get their money's worth .
9250,"they did not ! in fact , the young kid that took over at qb for kansas city won the nfl mvp this year ! !"
9251,that's awesome . he was probably somewhat cheaper too . how did the redskin end up doing this year ?
9252,much cheaper ! they were doing decent but then alex smith got hurt and his backup did too . they wound up missing the playoffs .
9253,"you'd think i'd know , i spent ten years in dc . live in north east ohio now , i understand this mayfield guy is promising ."
9254,"yea , the browns fan seem to love him ! mahomes , the kc rookie , is african american . hopefully he can win a super bowl because only two have ever done it ."
9255,from my little understanding the browns would be happy not to have a losing season . are there theories why that stat you say is true ?
9256,"i just don't think a lot of african americans played qb until somewhat recently . a lot of oddities with qbs , kellen moore is the only left handed quarterback in the entire nfl !"
9257,"interesting , i know in many sports it can be an advantage to be left handed . when we think of quarterbacks often there is an image of them as always white , unfortunately ."
9258,i agree . such a significant position in the game . they touch the ball basically every play .
9259,"that much i do know . believe me , i've tried to get into football , but with an average game seeming to take three hours i just don't have the time ."
9260,"it does take forever . it is crazy how popular it is , especially at the college level . 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums are college team stadiums !"
9261,"and what , they play about ten home game , amazing . i did see a game at indiana state once , that stadium seemed pretty big to me ."
9262,"big and expensive ! the army , navy , and air force football coaches are the highest paid department of defense employees !"
9263,"isn't that kind of the same for the colleges , no one makes more money than the football coach ? still not in the same league as alex smith and his extension ."
9264,"yes , the coaches are always among the highest paid people in the state . it has come a long way from the first nfl playoff game being played on a 80 year dirt field in a hockey stadium ."
9265,"yes , the the times when bowlers made more than football players . there must be some very envious bowlers out there now ."
9266,"that is hard to even comprehend ! now you have high school stadiums that seat 18 , 000 and cost 60 million to build ! !"
9267,"i wonder how many people came to cumberland's next game in 1916 , after they lost 2220 . not sure i'd want to go back ."
9268,"haha , it would take a diehard ! it was great chatting with you today !"
9269,you too
9270,do you like baker mayfield ? i think his a great qb
9271,i went to oklahoma university and have listened to or watched every game since i was ten years old . he is a spectacular qb to watch and i was glad he was drafted number one last year .
9272,"he is right , he was first in the top 10 nfl draft so thats something"
9273,"yes . cleveland picked him number one . they have some other good young players , so they could get pretty good pretty quickly ."
9274,"he was the heisman tropjy winner , his pick was unprecedented , the browns kept it as a secret choice ."
9275,"he came in in game 3 when cleveland was behind and won the game . he was the starter after that . i live in phoenix , and arizona picked josh rosen at number 10 . the offensive line was so awful that he lost confidence and the season went on ."
9276,"the selection provided mayfield with bid goals , he won the trophy and then he had a monumental task ahead of him , i heard he had a bad start"
9277,"he was great when he came in on that first game , but had a few shaky games and then finished strong . he cried when the browns owner called to tell him that he would be the number one pick ."
9278,"i bet that was a special moment in his life , qb have a tough luck in the team though , the team is considered or was considered a qb graveyard ,"
9279,it sure is . since 1999 they have only had one qb who started every game of a single season .
9280,"tough luck , if the qb doesnt have regularity then the rest of the team is going to suffer , to think baker mayfiled almost quti football to become pro gamer"
9281,"true . he might have made 1 million playing halo , but made 50 million by signing that pro contract ."
9282,"1 million wow , thats a lot of moeny for video games , but yeah , sounds like he made the right decision in the end , 50 million is a lot more"
9283,you know that alex smith took so many ap tests that he was a junior the first time he stepped on his college campus .
9284,"sounds like he is a really smart qb , i didnt know that , i bet few players did something similar"
9285,i would agree . that is a lot of advanced placement . he was studying for his master's degree by the time he turned pro .
9286,"so he also has a masters degree , thats impressive , maybe even a phd ?"
9287,"i doubt the phd . since there are 32 nfl teams , 31 are disappointed every year"
9288,"31 disappointed and the patriors is usually the happy 32 team , they win all the time brady is one of the big reasons"
9289,that is true . he has now won 6 super bowls . those nfl games only have 11 minutes of game action .
9290,"only 11 minutes ? that seems unfair ,"
9291,"hi , how are you ? i have chatted much in recent days about football . you ?"
9292,"hello there , i like football , but have been watching basketball lately . did you watch the superbowl this year ?"
9293,no i didnt have a chance to see the sb . i heard that it was a bit slow .
9294,"yeah it sure was , the first 3 quarters there was no much offense or scoring at all . not very exciting , not like the year before i will say ."
9295,"the year before had a big comeback , right ?"
9296,"yeah the eagles and the pats had a good back and forth going , with the eagles qb making some crazy plays to win the game ."
9297,"the eagles had not won the sb before , right ? that was their first , i think"
9298,"yeah good call , it was their first . i think they deserved it and wasn't going to feel sorry for the pats , since they have dominated the last 10 years or so ."
9299,"yeah , brady has six rings now ? someone else deserves a turn"
9300,"i think he does yeah , he will go down as one of the greatest . i was hoping the kc chiefs would have won it , with their young star qb ."
9301,i wonder what is going to happen next year . the nfl needs to deal with the problem of concussions and injury .
9302,"they sure do , i hope all of the tracking technology can be used to improve player safety . did you see the movie concussion , with will smith ?"
9303,"i did not . does he play a doctor or something ? there was a nigerian guy doing research on cte , right ?"
9304,"yep , he plays a doctor that does extensive research on cte and a lot of people involved in the league don't want to accept his findings till years later ."
9305,"yeah , there is too much money to be made . player injuries get in the way of that ."
9306,yeah they sure do . did you know that there is no rule regarding female players in the league ?
9307,i heard that . i wonder if a woman will ever show up at tryouts .
9308,"i hope so , but i think the system we have in place , well actually we don't have a system in place for girls to work their way up to the pro level ."
9309,"yeah , there is no high school or college ball for girls . they cant prepare for the pros ."
9310,"yep , that is why it will be hard , but once one does , i think it will open the floodgates for all types of women's programs which would be cool ."
9311,"i would like to see more women in sports . athletics is important for many reasons . anyway , great chat !"
9312,"yeah i agree there , and same to you , i hope you have a good day !"
9313,hi ! do you follow the rams at all ? i'm glad sean mcvay became the top candidate for coach of the year . he deserves it after what he's done in his first season with the rams !
9314,can't say that i follow the rams no . i do think that sean did a great job though . i could definitely see him winning that award . his team is the number 3 seed in the nfc playoff field now . so that's definitely good
9315,so very true . it's certainly rare to do what he's done like molding jared goff to become a franchise qb and turning todd gurley into an mvp candidate especially in year one !
9316,"well let me ask you this , do you like football at ? personally i only watch it a little bit , but my favorite quarterback is tom brady , who's your favorite quarterback ?"
9317,i do and i'm in agreement with you . tom brady is definitely my favorite quarterback or ' qb ' . can you believe his jv high team refused to start him when he was a back up while the team never won or scored a touchdown ? that is unbelievable !
9318,wow that's insane ! i wonder why they did it that way haha . another thing i didn't know is that a deaf quarterback created the huddle . he used it so that the other team could not see his hands signing
9319,"that makes so much sense and i'm sure coaches and players over the years appreciate him for that ! even left handed quarterbacks like kellan moore , who just so happens to be the only left handed qb in the nfl today !"
9320,that is shocking ! do you think it gives him an advantage or a disadvantage ? have you heard about baker mayfield as well ? he was almost a professional gamer but switched over to playing for the nfl
9321,"i'm sure it probably gives him an advantage since it's ' different ' . but i didn't know that about baker . that was a wise choice , i'm sure in terms of pay . even though engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of nfl and mlb players , but i would guess nfl players make more than pro gamers . ha !"
9322,haha i think you're right ! a lot of these quarterbacks are really talented though . did you hear about alex smith ? he got his fouryear degree in only 2 years and was working on his master's before joining the nfl
9323,wow ! he must be a genius . people like him have the brains or talent while people like benjarvus greenellis have such unique talent like never fumbling the football in their entire pro career !
9324,that is an incredible feat ! another incredible feet would be if a female player joined the nfl . apparently there is no rule that does not allow for that
9325,"that us true . makes you wonder why one had never been drafted or picked up by a team . the nfl gameplay is only an average 11 minutes , so you'd think they would at least sign a female to be a kicker or something !"
9326,haha yeah right ! i could see a female kicker . did you hear about the tracking chips that they put in players shoulder pads though ? hopefully they take those off so they can't be tracked when they're not playing haha
9327,"oh , no kidding ! no telling what those players do after a game ! ha ! then again , they could track saints players to see if cheerleaders are dining in the same restaurant as them , which is forbidden . can you believe that ?"
9328,"i can't believe that . in this day and age that seems completely unnecess on a separate note , did you ever bowl by chance ? i guess top bullying players earn more than top football players back in the 1960s"
9329,"are you serious ? bowling must have been major back in those days . but i still don't think it's as unbelievable as georgia tech beating cumberland 2220 back in 1916 , which to this day is the record for the highest score in footfall ."
9330,"that is an amazing record ! i wish that we had a video of that game because i would have liked to have seen that . imagine how bad you would feel if you were a cumberland fan that day haha . , i wonder if they had a lefthanded quarterback like kellen moore maybe that was their secret haha"
9331,ha ! no kidding . it would be interesting to see ! almost like the university of iowa's visiting team locker room beinf painted completely pink . i bet that's a sight to behold ! ha !
9332,haha that would be a crazy thing to see ! i always wonder if that would make me play better or worse though ! what do you think ?
9333,it's tough to say . i suppose it could be motivational or depressing ! but let's be honest : it isn't as innovative as espn creating the yellow first down line ! ha ! they totally deserved an emmy for that . well it was great chatting with you tonight !
9334,"good morning , are you a football fan ?"
9335,good morning ! i sure am ! never miss my teams game during the regular season . how about you ?
9336,"i am a big fan as well . i root for the eagles , who is your favorite team ?"
9337,"uh oh , we may have some trouble ! im a patriots fan over here haha . although i dont hate the eagles at all , i think theyre a good team too"
9338,i guess as a patriots fan you're probably use to everyone hating your team . i can admit it's purely out of jealousy though so you have that going for you .
9339,"yea thats it true , i guess thats a good thing . you guys beat us last year though in the super bowl"
9340,that was really exciting for us last year . it felt good to beat one of the best teams out there . it was a nice bit of revenge from our previous match up . this year's super bowl was a lot more boring .
9341,"i agree with that 100 percent , what a snore fest ! at least both teams showed up finally in the 4th quarter"
9342,how much longer do you think the patriots dynasty has ? they haven't really planned for the end of brady's career yet or
9343,"i think either this year or next year will be his last . and who knows , with those issues with robert kraft there might be some ownership shakeup which could lead to some new thoughts on the coaching staff"
9344,"i don't think kraft is really looking at anything besides a fine and suspension . his public image definitely took a big hit , but a few other owners have been involved in some shady business and still own their teams ."
9345,"thats true . its just such a silly thing he did . so many questions ! ah well . did you know the highest scoring game was 2220 , i wonder what how the other team felt after that one"
9346,the defense had to be exhausted ! the offense was probably ready for another game .
9347,haha i wonder if the offense ever even hit the field !
9348,with that score i have to believe there was some defensive touchdowns by the other team . if not they were on the field for 3 plays at a time .
9349,thats crazy . why do you think university of iowa paints the visiting footballs teams locker room pink ?
9350,"if they think that's going to throw the other team off their game , they are probably mistaken ."
9351,"they might think it has some sort of psychological effect , but im not sure it works"
9352,i don't think iowa has any national championships so i'm going to chalk it up as a failure .
9353,"haha i agree , they should reevalute their strategy"
9354,"it was fun chatting football with you , hopefully we get the third match up in the super bowl so we can break the tie between the eagles and patriots !"
9355,lets hope ! itll be an interesting game
9356,good morning ! do you like and or or watch football ?
9357,good morning . i love football . what about you ?
9358,same here . i think that the 17 week regular season is just too short .
9359,i think so too . wish they would make it longer . did you know kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl ?
9360,no i didn't ! that is really surprising ! i know they used to have a deaf quarterback which was also surprising to me .
9361,i heard that's how the circular huddle came about so they other team couldn't see the play calling .
9362,"i've heard that too . you know , i had always thought the huddle was just part of the game so the team could call the play ."
9363,i thought so too . baker mayfield once thought about quitting football to pursue a career in professional gaming .
9364,"baker mayfield has so much confidence he can probably do anything and be good at it ! i mean , he has made the claim that he can beat anyone at his school at one on one halo 3 ."
9365,i agree . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he was automatically a junior when he started college .
9366,he must be really smart and high achieving ! so does that mean he was only in college for two years before being drafted ?
9367,"i think so , but not too sure on that ."
9368,i guess he was younger than other draftees . yet he is still just as good as the rest . what do you think about women becoming players ?
9369,"i could see them being a kicker , but that's about it . what about you ?"
9370,i don't know . i know that by rule they have to meet the nfl's eligibility requirements . i guess if they can do that then i can see them being players . i just don't know if any teams would take them .
9371,i agree . did you know the average nfl game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
9372,"no , it seems like so much longer . i guess that means that most of the three hours is just commercials then ?"
9373,commercials and play calling .
9374,that could explain why the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are more than a player's .
9375,i think so too . nfl player careers are usually short lived .
9376,yeah they are . have you heard about the saint's rules for cheerleaders ?
9377,have you seen lamar jackson play this season ?
9378,he did good against cincinnati . seems like they have too much money invested i first round draft picks to not start them these days .
9379,flacco has a large contract as well . 26 . 5 million .
9380,"that could give the ravens a reason to trade him , give them some space in the salary cap ."
9381,yeah there aren't many super bowl mvp winning qb's available for needy teams either
9382,if jackson keeps running he may not have that long in the league . maybe they should hold on to flacco another season .
9383,true his teammate was also a heisman winning running qb . insurance is always good to have
9384,did you hear about ozzie newsome stepping aside ?
9385,"i have , he has been a pretty good gm in his time . he helped build 2 super bowl winning teams"
9386,the new gm will probably want to capitalize on jackson's talent .
9387,he's taking over a pretty talented time . as long as everything stays stable . coach harbaugh might be gone though
9388,"yeah , he could go to another of the 32 teams i suppose ."
9389,the super bowl is coming this weekend . its played on the 1st sunday of febuary
9390,i usually watch for the commercials . the average game has only 11 minutes of gameplay . that's a lot of commercials .
9391,it is ! think how many commercials would have aired in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220
9392,"i guess there wasn't a mercy rule then either . i wonder what they would have thought of our televised version of the game . like the superimposed yellow line , that's some interesting technology espn introduced ."
9393,they won an emmy for that !
9394,i guess they give those out to anyone these days . technology is pervasive . baker mayfield almost quit football to be a competitive gamer . probably less hamstring injuries there .
9395,a heisman winning . halo player . i wonder how good he really was
9396,as good as patriots back greenellis who never fumbled once ?
9397,lets not go that far
9398,did you see any of the super bowl last sunday ? it capped off an interesting nfl season .
9399,"i did watch that , i liked it , what is shocking is that the avg . nfl game only has 11 minutes of actual game playing , that seems low"
9400,"that would explain why i get bored watching sometimes . it also explains why the announcers try to be such personalities , i suppose ."
9401,"yup i agree , i watched the super bowl but i don't follow sports , i do thy're kind of boring , what would be progressive is allowing female players in the nfl"
9402,"allowing female players would be good . there have been a few in college , so maybe someday one or more will make the transition . the nfl has no rule against them , but doesn't have the best track record for dealing with women , especially cheerleaders ."
9403,"right that is true , i saw a saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if an nfl player is present , that seems very silly to me"
9404,reading that made me shake my head . it is 2019 after all . things sure have changed since the early days when nfl players made less money than professional bowlers .
9405,"ya they definitely have , also surprisng is that over their lifetime , a nfl player will make less than an engineer , on average"
9406,"more money , less pounding on the body . engineering sounds like the way to go ! although , tom brady has made a a pretty good career for himself , even though it may not have started so well ."
9407,"ya you're right , i read that his wife actually makes more than he does"
9408,"that was a bit odd , you're right . brady seems to be a lightning rod for a lot of things . his success has created a lot of haters . six rings is pretty amazing no matter who you are ."
9409,"yup i agree he deserves respect , if i were him i'd alwyas give the ball to greenellis though , that guy has never fumbled the ball"
9410,that is an amazing stat . and you're right . every quarterback needs a running back he can depend on .
9411,"ya definitely , do you watch football on tv or in person ? i guess espn won an emmy for making the yellow line to create the first down on tv"
9412,"i have never been to a live game , how about you ? i watch sporadically here at home . espn has indeed done some innovative things , for sure , but sometimes their announcers are hard to listen to for very long ."
9413,"ya i don't even have cable but if i do watch sports it is on tv , did you hear how the university of iowa painted teh opposing teams locker room ? that would make me play a lot harder haha"
9414,"yeah , that is an interesting bit of gamesmanship . i can't imagine sitting in there very long . it would drive me crazy . anything for a mental edge , i suppose ."
9415,"ya i suppose , have you ever heard of the highest scoring football game of all time ? it was 2220 haha"
9416,how does that happen ? ? i can't even imagine what that was like to watch . how bad did the losing team have to be ?
9417,"haha nope i don't like any sports so no worries ? and ya the teams were georgia tech and cumberland , cumberland must have been devestated afterwards haha"
9418,"devastated , embarrassed , disheartened . i wonder if they even have football anymore . maybe competitive gaming might be more their specialty . apparently some people actually make a living doing that ."
9419,"ive heard of that , i think baker mayfield was almost a competitive gamer right ? smart that he chose football instead haha"
9420,"do you have a favorite quarterback in the nfl ? i don't watch football much , but i do like tom brady and a few others ."
9421,"i do , tom brady of course , i'm a fan of the patriots , alex smith is another great qb"
9422,kellan moore is also really cool because he's the only lefty . i always hear his name and have to think a minute . i get this football player mixed up with kellyanne conway of all people .
9423,"is he really the only lefty in the league ? i thought there were at least a couple more , do you know who invented the circular huddle ?"
9424,"no , i'm not sure who did . i always enjoy watching the huddles in the football games on tv . i like to imagine ad lib what they're saying and thinking ."
9425,"the huddle was invented by paul . d . hubbard , he was a deaf qb ."
9426,"wow , that's really smart of him . it's amazing how it caught on and is still used today in football games even in the nfl ."
9427,being deaf sure was a big disadvantage but maybe his other senses heightened and he was able to play better thanks to that .
9428,that sounds reasonable . i've heard of that happening with people who lose one sense . did you know that tom brady started out as kind of a failure at football ? he was only a backup to begin with .
9429,he was ? its kind of hard to imagine that i bet his team had a great qb and also a great team .
9430,"well , i guess the quarterback and the whole team of brady's wasn't doing too well and he really should have been put in but for some reason they didn't let him play , even . sad football season for him ."
9431,"i bet that made him improve his skills , he definitely showed his coach"
9432,"yes , i bet the coach was embarrassed after that ! lol quarterbacks seem to be in the news a lot . i never hear of the field goal kickers or something , do you ?"
9433,"no not really , they are only in the news when they miss an important shot lol , did you hear about the emmy espn won because of the yellow first down line"
9434,"that's amazing ! i wonder how much that increased their income ? do you like soccer aka football , too ?"
9435,"i do like it , its one of my favorite sports as well i also like rugby"
9436,"i used to play football soccer a lot when i was a kid . i was pretty good at it and always seemed to lose balls over fences , though . lol"
9437,"yeah that happened to me as well i just watch it now lol , do you like rugby as well ? what about gaelic football ?"
9438,i do like rugby but it's hard to catch a match on tv without cable . i think i've watched a match or two on youtube . i definitely watch nfl highlights on youtube a lot also .
9439,"i do that as well i just don't have the time to watch the games , they last a long time and all the ads just drive me crazy ."
9440,"it's hard to believe football season for nfl is only september through december . i wish we could have it year round . i guess the football players need some time to rest and practice , too , though ."
9441,"how's it going , do you like football ? a lot of people are speculating bill belichick is going to leave the patriots soon ."
9442,i don't watch a lot of football . what position does he play ?
9443,"he's the coach of the new england patriots , theres rumors that him and his qb tom brady are not getting along despite all the success they've had"
9444,"aw , that's not good . speaking of football , did you know iowa states locker room is painted pink ?"
9445,"yea lol , i guess iowa is really trying to play mind games on the visiting team with the pink locker room , or they really like pink"
9446,"yeah , seems like they're messing with them . i think pink is supposed to be a calming color ."
9447,i wonder if georgia tech did anything to mess with cumberland before the game they beat them 2220
9448,if not then they must have played a good game ! did you know that in the 1960s the top bowlers made twice as much as football players ?
9449,"no , that's pretty crazy but the average engineer also makes more than the average nfl player over a lifetime"
9450,that's pretty interesting . the nfl allows women if they meet the requirements .
9451,"interesting , since there no rule forbidding them i think it's possible to see a female placekicker"
9452,definitely seems possible . in an average nfl game there is only 11 minutes of live game play ! i never would have guessed that !
9453,"yea , it's shocking how many injuries occur in only 11 minutes of actual gameplay"
9454,absolutely ! and how much work goes into so little actual game play time . the nfl also tracks players movements through chips in their shoulder pads .
9455,"that's pretty crazy , it's also crazy that kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl"
9456,that's interesting . the junipero serra highschool jv football team had a historically bad season which they failed to even score a touch down . ouch .
9457,"yea , hopefully the coach of the jv team got fired for not even giving tom brady a start"
9458,the new orleans cheerleaders are banned from eating at the same place as the nfl players . that's weird .
9459,"that makes no sense , saints cheerleader should be able to eat wherever they want regardless if there are players there or not"
9460,"yeah , it does seem a little strange that the cheerleaders have to leave even if they were there first ."
9461,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
9462,"hi , how are you ?"
9463,"hello im great , do you like football ?"
9464,i do like football . do you ?
9465,"i like it as well , what do you think about the titans and the week 14 of the season"
9466,i like the titans and have no clue what happened in week 14 . i wonder what happened . . .
9467,i think they have a good team and they ended up winning 30 9 against jacksonville .
9468,so they were a good bet ! then again a lot of teams had success against jacksonville this year . bortles really held them back this year . they had a good d . . .
9469,"yeah jacksonville didnt have a good team , so what is your favorite team ?"
9470,im a bears fan . we did well but not well enough for my liking .
9471,"i am a patriots fan , and hopefully next year you can make it to the superbowl , its hard to make it there when there are 16 good teams for each division"
9472,yeah . i am assuming you will be watching on sunday ? ? ? ?
9473,"i will sure watch the game , i have a whole party set up lol , friends are coming so its going to be a nice game to watch , even if we lose"
9474,that'll be fun . what's on the menu ?
9475,"chicken wings , burgers and beer , lots of beer lol , what are you doing for the game ? do you have something special set up ?"
9476,i will watch it at my house . my wife is not a huge fan but she watches this game with me . i will do jalapeno cornbread and jambalaya . can't wait !
9477,im counting the hours for sure lol i wonder how the chips the players have work or where that info goes to
9478,i know my chips will be going into my belly . . . they don't have a rule against women playing .
9479,"it would be interesting to watch a woman play on sunday , it would be a bold decision from the coach though"
9480,i am not sure the american public has the stomach to watch that . those guys are pretty big !
9481,"they are i guess thats why theres not a written rule yet , aterall its a game of strength ."
9482,good luck on sunday . nice chatting with you .
9483,"hi , do you follow football ? the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink !"
9484,"hi , yes i do . i wonder if that actually effects the visiting team or if they think it is funny ."
9485,"i guess they thought it was worth a shot . kind of feminine , but some women play pretty tough ."
9486,"i am surprised that in the 60s , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
9487,"it was a golden age of bowling , never to return . i guess they were the stars of the media at the time ."
9488,it may return ! crazier things have happened .
9489,"there's probably a better chance that women will play in the nfl , which has no written rule against female players"
9490,i wonder who will be the first woman player . i will give her a lot of credit !
9491,"probably a kicker , maybe a punter . women can be refs , probably cooaches too ."
9492,they deserve to be !
9493,very true . they would get treated better than cheerleaders i hope .
9494,agreed . i can not believe that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
9495,it seems so short but there are so many injuries . new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player .
9496,that is crazy ! i am surprised that is allowed to be passed .
9497,they would be better off becoming engineers . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player
9498,i guess that is because they have longer careers .
9499,very true . fewer concussions . that is the way to go . they could design chips that track players .
9500,it would be cool to record a players every move on the field .
9501,"true . anyway , i enjoyed chatting with you ! have a good day !"
9502,you too !
9503,thanks !
9504,bye
9505,hello ! are you watching the super bowl tonight ?
9506,i wish baker mayfield were playing in the game .
9507,"yeah , he sounds like a decent player . i don't know much about him overall , all though he seems like he's an excellent player . 016 is impressive !"
9508,"he won the heisman trophy in college , and was selected high in the draft ."
9509,"that's amazing . i know most people didn't think he was an obvious choice , but apparently cleveland knew what they were doing ."
9510,many thought sam darnold or josh allen were better choices .
9511,"why are qbs so important ? i mean i get that they lead , but there's so many other positions on a team , why are they so important ?"
9512,the quarterback touches the football on almost every offensive play .
9513,"yeah , but still . for a game that averages only 11 minutes of live gameplay , you'd think other positions would get a chance to be in the spot light . it seems like teams live and die by their qb . . ."
9514,"perhaps , but the forward pass will remain essential ."
9515,"no , i get it . it's the beginning of the play . i wonder why rugby didn't take off over here come to think of it . . ."
9516,i think it is because football is brave enough to do things like the pink locker room in iowa .
9517,the pink locker room ? is that a breast cancer awareness thing ?
9518,"no , i think is was related to the fact espn won an emmy for the yellow line . i may be wrong though ."
9519,"huh , i never heard of it . my nfl and college team were both horrible this year and i don't have cable , so i gave up on going out to watch the game in october or so . the disappointment wasn't worth the money ."
9520,perhaps you can try following soccer or gaelic football .
9521,"i've thought about it . i think rugby would be more my style , even though i'd probably like hockey more . although i've got to say . . . i'd root for any team that has a woman join ."
9522,do you think such a thing is even legal within the rules of the game ?
9523,"as long as they meet the requirements for the league , why not ?"
9524,"i don't know , but since engineers make more than atheletes over a lifetime , perhaps they are the wiser ones ."
9525,both are a lot of work .
9526,yes . designing the chips in shoulder pads and playing with them are both difficult !
9527,certainly ! one's way safer though .
9528,"hello , do you like football ?"
9529,hello ! i do ! how about you ?
9530,"i watch it sometimes , not a lot though . did you know the nfl uses tracking chips on the players and football ?"
9531,i didn't know that ! is it to track movements and every move on the field ?
9532,"yeah stats , location , spin , speed stuff like that"
9533,oh cool ! can you believe there is a rocket scientist that is a coach in the nfl now ?
9534,thats pretty interesting .
9535,football is crazy around here though . 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams .
9536,"thats believeable , college football is so serious , just like the nfl it generates a ton of money ."
9537,it even goes down to the high school level where a texas high school spent 60 million dollars on their stadium . i bet they don't even pay their teachers well either .
9538,"wow , well texas is a big football state , they are obsessed , but i guess theres nothing to do out there ."
9539,haha you're right ! did you know there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
9540,"i did read that recently , fun fact ! the average football game is only 11 min ! !"
9541,and we sit there for 3 hours watching the whole game too just for those 11 minutes lol .
9542,"i know right , thats excessive . too many time outs , huddles and fouls lol"
9543,we continue to love it though . maybe it's because of the unknown during the game .
9544,in the 60's top bowlers made almost 2 times more than football players .
9545,look at them now haha . i would have chosen bowling over football any day back then lol .
9546,"hell yeah , less injuries lol bowling is pretty fun ."
9547,oh for sure . i didn't know how much those big flags they waive across the field cost !
9548,"right , that is ridiculous that they cost 50k"
9549,"hopefully the money goes to a great cause ! anyways , i had a great chat with you , have a good night !"
9550,hi how are you ? do you like football ?
9551,no i do not like football . i also do not like tla . three letter acronyms will be the death of modern society .
9552,"yes tla will the dms , that is true . we should be careful and cyb ."
9553,would matt patrricia know what cyb is ? he was a rocket scientist before becoming a coach .
9554,"cover your behind . dms death of modern society . , btw , matt is a genius . he knows every tla ."
9555,right . cover your behind . very well . is it important to people that like football to like the announcers . brett favre would be as good as any talking head .
9556,"i guess . does he have the personality to fill the booth though ? he might need to have a few , just like madden ."
9557,interesting . have a few . it helps when watching a game to have a few . i could provide some play by play narrative on the picking of a new espn play analyst .
9558,"well , madden is known to drink while doing play by play . he is a colorful guy , but really needs to restrain himself ."
9559,"peyton manning turned down espn and fox sports to be the face of the telecast . perhaps madden , after having a few gets a little handsy ?"
9560,"lol . yeah , john , boy , he gets lonely up in that booth . the man is a legend but he is past his prime . time for a change up there ."
9561,do you find the idea of play by play on searching for a play analyst for football kind of odd . entertainment has be come entertainment . or something .
9562,"yeah , every thing is so meta these days , that meta itself is getting old . we need like megameta or something ."
9563,metameta . i like it . i was worried you would pull a tla out . michael stahan seems to have launched a successful broadcasting career . skipped the booth and right to morning tv .
9564,"morningtv . man , i could not do that . i would get tired of getting up early . um , who is michael stahan ?"
9565,new york giants defensive end . 15 year career in the nfl . gap between his front teeth . i wonder if he will use his new found celebrity to push the nfl to study concussions .
9566,i hope so . that is terrible problem at all levels of the sport . cte should be looked into and people should know the risks of the sport .
9567,"the nfl is in a unique position to study the problem . they have data , tracking chips in shoulder pads . they have plenty of test subjects . if only they could avoid being found liable for injury ."
9568,"yes , i guess . once they know , then they all liable . still , if they dont try , people will suspect the worst . anyway , great chat !"
9569,"right on . track the ball velocity , speed and rotation and never learn a thing . good job nfl ."
9570,it is a business . the nfl wants to keep the money coming .
9571,"17 weeks of regular season , they have to grab cash fast ."
9572,the national football league is the one of the major sports league in north america . it consist of 32 team .
9573,"they divide them into two divisions , so that they can play against each other to work their way toward the super bowl ."
9574,"the nfl season starts from september to late december . the nfl is started in 1920 as apfa , renaming itself in 1922 as nfl ."
9575,i didnt know that . as long as i have heard about pro football it has always been the nfl .
9576,the nfl has no written rule against the female player they want to met the leagues eligibility requirement .
9577,"im not sure many women would want to play , they dont even treat cheerleaders well . i cant imagine who they would treat a female player ."
9578,women they want to work hard to fit in the game . nfl uses tracking chips in the players shoulder pads to records move in the field . this shows their aggression to win the trophy .
9579,"it isnt hard to be aggressive for just 11 minutes , that is how much game play there is in the average game ."
9580,they are earn more revenue than other players . so only they want to lift the trophy .
9581,the only one who had been touching the trophy lately are the new england patriots . . . lol
9582,which is your favourite team ?
9583,"my family is from miami , so i grew up a dolphins fan . no trophies for me . lol"
9584,"in modern american football , the quarterback is called as the leader of offense ."
9585,"the qb is definitely an important part of the game . one of the most notable in recent times , tom brady didnt even get a chance to play on his jv team !"
9586,alex smith is important player all time . he work hard to win each and every game .
9587,he had so many credits in hs that he could afford to start working on a masters degree before entering the draft .
9588,the quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive play and they make the forward passes .
9589,"yes , they do . did you know how the circular huddle came about ?"
9590,the university of iowas locker room for visiting football is always painted with pink . do you know ?
9591,"i had heard that before , nice little intimidation tactic there ."
9592,sports is commonly football in some countries include the association football .
9593,isnt that what they call soccer in the us ?
9594,its is soccer in us . some countries called by in the name of football .
9595,"i must go , nice chat . have a great day ."
9596,hello .
9597,"hey , are you into football ?"
9598,"oh yea , you ?"
9599,yes . did you hear chase routllier is starting center with the redskins ?
9600,"no , i didn't . the washington redskins selected the wyoming product with a sixthround pick in the 2017 draft"
9601,"nice . i enjoy watching chase roullier . he takes very good angles , and good technique . he's a rookie , but he seems to be excelling in his position on the team ."
9602,"yes , and he's just going to continue to get better"
9603,"yeah , he has to get comfortable with the offense with him being a center . did you also hear chris thompson , runner back , is almost back to full health ?"
9604,that's great to hear . the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements .
9605,i definitely agree with that statement . i know a lot of teams do not treat the cheerleaders of the football teams equally . the new orleans saint's cheerleaders are not even allowed to eat in the same restaurant as their football players . so i bet the female players wouldn't get treated fairly .
9606,"wow , i can't stand the saints anyways . nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
9607,"i believe that the nfl shouldn't allow technology like that , because it could make coach's nit pick player's every moves . they need to let the players play naturally . thank you for talking with me today about football ."
9608,"yes , i enjoyed it as well ."
9609,did you hear about the new helmet rule in the nfl ?
9610,"no , what's that rule ."
9611,players cannot lower their heads and make contact with opponents . i seen it on an eagles game i was watching .
9612,"oh yes , that is correct . i have heard about that one . the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220"
9613,i think the rule is hard for players when they are used to tackling in that manner . wow that score is so high !
9614,"yes , they are . they continue to change rules ."
9615,did you know espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow line representing the first down line for american football games ?
9616,"no , i didn't . very interesting . thanks . can you hit done"
9617,"yes , thank you !"
9618,hi . do you like football ?
9619,"well , i've learned a lot about the function of a quarterback today ."
9620,the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink
9621,what an odd color to paint a locker room ! i wonder if it helped them score better !
9622,maybe . the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220
9623,that is an incredible amount of points to score in a football game ! unbelievable ! the other team must have been terrible !
9624,yes . former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
9625,that sounds like a nearperfect record . what a talented football player . i wonder how much he was paid as a player .
9626,don't know . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars
9627,"it sounds like bowling was a much more lucrative career back then , than football was . hard to imagine a time when bowling paid more than football !"
9628,yes . espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football game
9629,"that's kind of funny winning an emmy for a yellow line that is superimposed on a tv screen . usually emmys are given for best acting , or something like that ."
9630,true . kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl
9631,"that's interesting . i wonder if being lefthanded makes it harder or easier for other players . a deaf player by the name of paul d . hubbard created the circular huddle they use now in football . by huddling in a circle , the other team wasn't able to read his hand signals ."
9632,i remember hearing that . there's a guy who does a commercial with one hand .
9633,what kind of a commercial do you mean ? what does he do with his hand ?
9634,i think for a car . he's in the nfl .
9635,"oh , so he does sign language , or uses football signals ? they should allow women to play football in the nfl , don't you think ?"
9636,no . they can if they want to . there's no rule to stop them .
9637,"women can wear helmets just like the male football players . however , it would be hard for women to block tackles from big men . the new orleans cheerleaders can even eat in the same restaurant as players do . i guess that is to avoid fraternization ."
9638,"i never knew that . plus , the cheerleaders have to watch their figures ."
9639,"i'm sorry , i meant to say they cannot eat in the same restaurant as football players . the cheerleaders are even required to leave the place if an nfl player arrives . that's really strange ! lol"
9640,yes . a lot of companies have strange policies . it's sort of like the me too movement .
9641,"i'm not sure how that is similar to the me too movement . can you explain what you mean ? the technology today is getting so precise , they even record every move the football players make when they're playing on the field . the nfl uses tracking chips that are located in the shoulder pads , and inside the footballs , too ."
9642,"i never knew that . i think it's similar to me too , because everything now is sexual harassment . i'm not saying there's no sexual harassment , but everything is too pc ."
9643,"oh , i see what you mean . you mean they don't want the football players and cheerleaders to date or socialize to avoid any harassment issues ."
9644,"yes , but to me that is silly . like why would they wear such outfits ? if you find it demeaning , or however , don't take that job ."
9645,the cheerleaders are assigned to wear skimpy outfits to entice male viewers . i'm not sure if you're connecting the outfits to the rule about not eating in the same restaurants or not .
9646,"yes , i am . i'm saying everything is over sensitive now ."
9647,"i suppose you are right . there has been so much publicity about harassment and it looks bad when nfl players are caught doing something like rape , or assault . they need those chips on them all the time , not just on the field !"
9648,lol maybe one day we will all get chips .
9649,"these chips can read so much information ! the ones the football players wear track their speed , their rotations and even how fast the ball is going and where the ball is located on the field ."
9650,interesting . i have to go finish cooking my dinner . take care .
9651,nice talking to you . have a good dinner .
9652,bye
9653,good morning to you !
9654,"good morning , do you like watching football by chance ?"
9655,i do ! i never miss a patriots game during the season . what about you ?
9656,"i am a fan of the patriots but i dont follow every game , you must love brady then ."
9657,"yea hes one of the best ! interesting guy in his personal life , but he's a heck of a quarterback"
9658,yeah he is a legend just like benjarvus green ellis do you remember him ? he's a former rb that played in the pats .
9659,"yea i heard he has a great claim to his name , he never fumbled the ball in his entire career !"
9660,"he never did , he is another legend indeed , i think he's the only rb that can say that at least out of the good rbs in the history of the league ."
9661,i agree . did you hear about the highest scoring football game of all time ?
9662,"no , what is the highest scoring game of all time i wonder ?"
9663,it was a whopping 2220 ! georgia tech dominated cumberland
9664,"that must had been painful to watch lol , 2220 what was wrong with the losing team !"
9665,i dont know ! its almost like they didnt even show up to the game !
9666,"i know right , or maybe they only had one player on the opposing team i have to google that ."
9667,that would be a funny one to watch . one man on the field against an entire opposing team
9668,"that would be funny and also really unfair , no way one person could win alone , not even brady lol ."
9669,absolutely not haha . did you hear about alex smith ? apparently he was pretty smart and took all sorts of ap classes in high school . he even began working on his masters before getting drafted !
9670,i did hear about him he is a great qb but i didnt know he had a masters i guess he takes advantage of time .
9671,yea and i guess he really was preparing a fallback plan in case the football career didnt pan out . i wonder what he'll do when he retires
9672,"i bet he has plenty of choices , he does have a bachelor degree and also a masters degree so that should help him ."
9673,"he does . speaking of degrees , i better go study ! nice chatting with you !"
9674,do you watch football ?
9675,i do . what do you think of the nfl using tracking chips now in the shoulder pads to record data on the players ?
9676,i guess it makes it more accurate but it's crazy how fast technology is developing . espn also won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line .
9677,i love that yellow line . it makes it nice to see where they have to get to .
9678,yeah it helps a lot . it's amazing how much football has evolved . in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars .
9679,wow . i wonder if any females ever tried to play back then since the nfl doesn't have a rule that doesn't allow them to play .
9680,"and the circular huddle was invented for football , most likely back then , by a deaf quarterback ."
9681,pretty neat i think i've heard that before . i don't think he wanted the other team to steal his hand signals .
9682,yes you are right . and there used to be really high scoring games in 1916 . doubt it would happen today where georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 to 0
9683,georgia tech must have been really good back then . either that or cumberland was super bad .
9684,haha i wish i could see the footage . too bad it was so long ago !
9685,talk about a one sided game . kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl .
9686,"i wonder why that is . i wonder if there is a disadvantage . speaking of disadvantages , tom brady's high school was doing badly and they refused to start him ! now he is a four time super bowl champion ."
9687,isn't that something ? i think he was a 6th round pick too in the 2000 draft so every team passed on him before the patriots signed him .
9688,crazy ! good thing he did not give up . but it is good to have a backup plan like alex smith who got his bachelor's degree before being drafted into the nfl .
9689,that was pretty impressive . he got his degree in only 2 years !
9690,"yeah , that is awesome . what do you think about quitting football to go to full time competitive gaming ?"
9691,are you talking about baker mayfield ? that is the craziest thing i've heard .
9692,"yeah , he says he can beat anyone at his university one on one ."
9693,good call on his part to stick with football . if anything he should have thought about being an engineer since they make more over a lifetime than an average nfl player .
9694,"yeah , maybe you are right !"
9695,"hello , are you a football fan ?"
9696,i do watch the occasional game . i find it interesting that players are more famous than teams . like eli manning of the giants .
9697,i watch a game every blue moon . did you know the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ? crazy !
9698,"yes , there are a lot of rules , flags and time outs . its kind of like accounting . what do you think of kyle lauletta replacing manning ?"
9699,"i guess if manning isn't doing the job , it's time to play the rookie . teams have to do what they need to get a win ."
9700,it does seem he is not doing the job . it must be a tough choice for a coach . the qb touches the ball almost every play . to loose a great like manning would be rough .
9701,i am sure it must be but it might be time for them to move in . manning is 37 and i'm sure it's not as easy as it once was .
9702,"i like the way the word football means different things depending on location . some people would think soccer , some would think rugby ."
9703,yeah so confusing sometimes . i can't believe the highest score in a regular football game was 2220 back in 1916 ; ga tech v . cumberland . yikes !
9704,"that game must have been something to see , for the winning side . did you know that a high school stadium in texas seats 18 , 000 people and cost 60 million ?"
9705,"wow , i'd say that's a lot for a high school stadium . must be a huge school . wonder if they have any pink locker rooms like univ of iowa for their visiting football teams ."
9706,"football , its fun , games and pink locker rooms and serious as well . 14 of the 25 largest stadiums are college teams . i wonder if iowa is large and pink ."
9707,probably just trying to psych out the visitors . did you know that girls can actually play in the nfl ? there seems to be no written rule against it as long as they meet eligibility requirements .
9708,"that sounds like a good thing , but is it really ? do we want to see a girl get hurt on the field ? the nfl uses chips in players pads to track movement ."
9709,yeah that doesn't sound very appealing at all . would have to be a pretty tough gal for that . best to do the cheerleading thing probably though i feel bad for the no saints cheerleaders who are forbidden from eating in the same restaurants as nfl players .
9710,"cheerleading is a sport in it self . 32 football teams each have cheerleaders . but , they only work 17 weeks unless the team makes the playoffs ."
9711,they would definitely be busier cheering for patriots . they made playoffs a lot . in fact benjarvus green former patriot never once fumbled the ball in his nfl career .
9712,thats a neat thing to learn . nfl qb russell wilson is also a mlb player . the rangers traded him to the ny yankees . i wonder if he gets two checks .
9713,"too bad he didn't go for engineer as second job , they make more than nfl players and mlb players ."
9714,i think it has to do with some players making a name and being worth a great deal . the average engineer has no name and makes a decent amount . rocket scientist matt patricia is a coach in the nfl . i am sure he makes more as the coach than the rocket scientist .
9715,quite possibly ! hey nice chatting . have a great day .
9716,"hey who is your favorite quarterback ? i like tom brady , but i can appreciate kellen moore , he's the only lefthanded quarterback in the nfl !"
9717,i am a fan of most offensive members . i prefer the quarterback leaders . tom is the man !
9718,i agree ! what do you think about alex smith ? did you know he was actually a genius and almost got his master's degree ?
9719,"wow , that is impressive ! baker mayfield almost quit football to be a gamer . good thing he stayed in the sport !"
9720,"i agree i think he's got a better career playing football lol . what about the circular huddle , do you know how that started"
9721,i'm pretty sure it was from a quarterback that was hard of hearing . is that right ?
9722,"yes you're right , he was deaf and would use the huddle to cloak his hand signals actually ."
9723,"i would love to see women on the field . did you know the university of iowa locker room has been painted pink ? i guess pink is stereotypically associated with women , so maybe that's for any female players who might join the nfl ?"
9724,haha that's a good point . i wonder why they painted it that color by the way ? and can you believe the way that the saints treat their cheerleaders ? did you hear about that
9725,it is probably a good idea to keep the cheerleaders and players apart for drama purposes . of the 32 teams in the league i think the saints are the only ones that do that .
9726,"i heard that other teams do that but i'm not 100 percent sure , what do you think about teams using tracking chips to check the players on the field though ? that could be good for stats i think"
9727,i would love access to the data ! such interesting technology . worth the money since engineers make more than players do .
9728,"it is shocking , also shocking that the average nfl game only has about 10 or 11 minutes of gameplay , that's not too much time"
9729,pretty crazy that so much of the gaming is not active play . this year's superbowl was on the first sunday of february as it always is . pretty boring game of 11 minutes of play .
9730,yep i agree it was pretty boring . also boring is watching bowling games lol . they used to be the highest paid athletes back in the 60s
9731,i love bowling ! but watching it is boring . i wonder why they aren't paid as well all of these years later .
9732,they need to invent some new stuff to put on tv when bowling is on . like the yellow line that they use for football that espn invented
9733,who is your favorite afc team ? i can't wait for the superbowl next year when the afc plays the nfc .
9734,"i actually don't follow football that much . i do like the patriots though , are they in the afc ?"
9735,i am not sure . but the patriots are an amazing team . they will go down in history .
9736,"yep i agree . i love their running back benjarvus greenellis , he's never fumbled the ball before , he's so amazing"
9737,hi there ! do you watch football ? the nfl is made up of 32 teams .
9738,"yeah 32 teams 2 divisions , my favorite team is in the afc devision , so yeah , i like to watch football , what about you ?"
9739,i love to watch football . did you know former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the football in his nfl career ?
9740,"never fumbled ? really ? wow , i knew the guy was good but never fumbling the ball seems like an impossible feat for a rb"
9741,"yes , pretty amazing . football is an interesting sport . did you know that the nfl has no rules against female players as long as they can meet the league's eligibility requirements ?"
9742,"no didnt know about that , has a woman ever played in the nfl ?"
9743,i do not know . did you know that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live game play ?
9744,"i didnt know that either , i did know about the tracking chips players have in their shoulders , heard of those ones before ?"
9745,"no , what are they all about ?"
9746,"they pull stats out of the game , there are also chips on the ball that determine the speed , rotation , and other interesting facts of the football"
9747,now that is cool ! hard to believe that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player .
9748,"seems like engineers do really good , they get to earn more money and without the brain damages or injuries that football creates"
9749,that's what i was thinking . even the top bowlers in the 1960's made 2x as much as top football stars .
9750,"i guess football is a lot more popular now , i dont see pro bowlers making much money these days"
9751,"i agree . talking about this day and age , it's hard to believe that saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat at the same restaurants as the payers and if they are eating and a player comes in they have to go ."
9752,"that is a really unfair rule , the saints should change that , its totally rude and out of line"
9753,"yes , it's dated ! i am glad there is football though . i love the super bowl . it is usually held the first sunday in feb ."
9754,"im glad about that too , did you watch this years superbowl ?"
9755,"i sure did , did you ?"
9756,i also watched it i was rooting for the patriots but thought it was a boring game
9757,well it was good talking with you . bye now .
9758,hi ! are you into sports ?
9759,"i am , i like the nfl , do you ?"
9760,"yes , i enjoy some football here and there , i just wish there were somemfemale players . but i wouldnt go againt those though players , its intimidating ."
9761,did you know the average game is only 11 minutes long ?
9762,"yes , and its insane . sometimes i wish it was only 11 minutes . my husband can go a little nuts , hes a big fan"
9763,there are a lot of commercials . it is worse when you are there live .
9764,true ! i find it interesting how the nfl can track footballs to monitor speed and rotation ! i think the players are tracked too .
9765,"yeah , that is pretty cool . i wonder what they do with all of that data ?"
9766,"maybe that's how they see how fast players throw , so they can improve . i heard players have their shoulder pads chipped to track their move on the field ."
9767,"yeah , i heard that too . i'm not sure what they do with the information though ."
9768,"im not sure , but it would be interesting to find out . but did you know that an engineer makes more in a lifetime than a football player ?"
9769,i can believe that . i think on average football players don't last that long .
9770,at least they live their dream . although football has never paid well in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as football stars
9771,"that is pretty funny , it reminds me of the bill murray movie where he is a bowler ."
9772,"there are alot of interesting facts surrounding football , like that super imposed yellow line we all love , the espn won an emmy over that !"
9773,"yeah , that line is great . i have to be honest , i wonder if they won one for the thing that follows a hockey puck ?"
9774,"lol , thats a good question . not sure i wonder why cheerleaders have strict rules , they cant be in the same restaurant as player , atleast the saints have that rule"
9775,"interesting , the redskins have similar rules here . i know a few ex cheerleaders ."
9776,really ? how cool ! i guess not a perk of the job .
9777,"yeah , there was a player here , chris cooley , who got in trouble for marrying one . well nice chatting with you !"
9778,"i figured it was to keep them focused on the prize . anyway , fun chatting with you too , take care !"
9779,brett favre was one of the greatest qb ever do you agree .
9780,packers qb ? for sure . loved vikingspackers rivalry ! heard espn recently turned down favre for nfl broadcasting spot . they lost a lot of football knowhow ! what do you think ?
9781,"i didnt hear about that , but i think they they are missing out on a high rating ."
9782,"agree . they want to replace jon gruden on monday night football . he's back coaching the raiders . peyton manning turned down espn , too . another ratings loss ?"
9783,"could be , i don't follow them much but it seems like a mistake , peyton manning is another hall of famer ."
9784,"right . favre had a 20yr . career , a sb win , three nfl mvp awards , after all . who's your fav nfl team ?"
9785,"mine the patriots , the one with the biggest comeback on superbowl history , yours ?"
9786,"i saw that game against the falcons , wasn't it ?"
9787,"it was against the falcons , thought its the best game i have ever watched . so whats your favorite team ?"
9788,"have to admit that , of the 32 teams , i don't have a favorite . do like individual players . admire tom brady . did you know when he was in jv , his team lost every game and didn't even score a td , yet his coach never put brady , the backup qb , into a game ! little did that guy know . . ."
9789,"i didnt know that , i wonder why , his coach must had been terrible , do you also like alex smith , his another great qb ."
9790,"yes , heard he was so smart he entered college as a junior and got bachelor's in just 2 years . when did he join nfl ?"
9791,i think it was in the year 2005 he was the first pick in the nfl draft .
9792,"must be good , as well as smart . what team does smith qb now ?"
9793,"i have no idea , i dont really follow him anymore baker mayfield is another great qb , he is also a skilled gamer ."
9794,heard the name . college qb . univ . of oklahoma ?
9795,"yeah that the one , he considered quitting football and perusing a career in gaming"
9796,wow . thought football nfl paid better . but they say engineers lifetime earnings exceeds both nfl and mlb players . because injuries end careers ?
9797,"im guessing its because of that , engineers tend to have longer careers also so yeah , that makes sense ."
9798,did you know the av . nfl game has only 11 minutes of live game play ? guess they know : have embedded chips in players' shoulder pads these days . do they really need to track every move w or cameras everywhere ?
9799,"only 11 minutes really ? that's not much at all and that seems a bit invasive , i guess the players get used to that eventually , anyways its been great chatting with you today ."
9800,"chip no problem for my fav . player , rb saquon barkley of giants . makes you want to watch football all day great young athlete . catch him on 2018 nfl highlights ! thanks for great chat !"
9801,"i agree he is a great athlete and player , one of the best rb out there , thanks for the chat bye ."
9802,hello hows it going ? did you know the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay
9803,"yeah , in some ways the nfl treats women well , but in others , it treats them really poorly . the cheerleaders in particular . the saints cheerleaders even have to leave a reseaurant if the players walk in after theyve been eating ."
9804,"yeah i read that too pretty sad ! this one is really interesting : nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
9805,"thats pretty crazy . i never watched much football , our school didn't have a team . i'm more familiar with soccer , although they call that football in a lot of other countries ."
9806,right . the junpero serra high school jv football team recorded a historically bad season in which they failed to win a game or even score a touchdown yet they never attempted to start their backup quarterback . that backup quarterback they refused to start is 4 time super bowl champion tom brady .
9807,"that sounds like my life . just imagine how much money those player make now , in 1960 , top bowlers were actually getting paid more ."
9808,lol wow bowling must have been really popular back then lol
9809,"lol i guess so . apparently the highest score ever in a football game was georgia tech vs cumberland , 2220 in 1916 ."
9810,"geez thats horrible . lol alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a junior . the quarterback received his bachelor's degree in two years , and began working on a master's degree , before becoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft ."
9811,"i watched a documentary not too long ago about the neurosurgeon that investigated traumatic brain injuries in nfl players , it was crazy ."
9812,"wow , thats probably sad to watch ."
9813,"it was sad . they make a ridiculous amount of money , but they can only work for a few years . and what can they do afterwards ?"
9814,well if they saved their millions of dollars hopefully they can travel the world and relax .
9815,"football , rugby , and soccer are all in the same family of sports . all involving kicking a ball towards a goal ."
9816,former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
9817,i read that the circular huddle was adapted by a deaf player so that the opposing team couldnt real him hand signals .
9818,thats pretty considerate of the nfl .
9819,there is only one left handed quarterback in the entire nfl .
9820,that seems odd . former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
9821,lol one player considered quitting to play halo professionally . nfl or must not treat them that great .
9822,lol right ! its been good chatting with you .
9823,hello do you follow the nfl ?
9824,they run too quickly . but i do watch them on tv . you ?
9825,i'm a fan . out of the 32 teams in the nfl do you have a favorite team ? i'm a browns fan myself .
9826,my condolences . i am a recovering bills fans myself . my biggest cheers are heard during the bye week .
9827,"nice ! i'm not too far from bills territory . i live in extreme north east ohio and when we go to erie , pa to shop it turns into bills country . lol"
9828,"wave hello when you get near the border of ny . i'' be wearing a parka . you know , the nfl has no written rules against women in the nfl ? that is what keeps the bills under the cap . ."
9829,lol i've been your way quite a few times . we always stop at that big rest stop on i90 in ny . i always look forward to seeing the big indian statue as well . lol
9830,nice ! i have a friend in med school in erie . . . osteopathic medicine . that is what cheerleaders are trained in . especially the ones in new orleans that are prohibited to mingle with nfl players over dinner . mingling is hazardous to ones health .
9831,isn't that the oddest rule ? i wonder why they came up with it ? did you know that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
9832,"in bills country we would celebrate if there was at least one minute of ' live gameplay ' you know , the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is more than that of a nfl player ? that is why the current hr trend it to give the players the job position of ' football engineer '"
9833,lol in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of the day . i'm sure that's way different now .
9834,"bowlers are making a comeback . they are seeing more and more concussions these days ! soon they will be putting tracking chips in their bowling balls to plot the velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location . . . for those that did not watch the first time ."
9835,lol that's great ! do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was ?
9836,2220 . . . that must have been a brutal game !
9837,talk about a blowout ! ouch . lol the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room completely pink . wonder why they did that ?
9838,"as a calming influence on the players , i am sure the visiting team is always grateful for their considerate behavior ! like i am so thankful to espn for that superimposable yellow line they put on the field , . it calms me down considerably !"
9839,lol yes me too . especially when the team i'm rooting for crosses that yellow line !
9840,"gives you a burst of endorphins ! that's why i am hooked on the game . the whole time the teams are in the huddle i'm saying , ' who invented the huddle , and why are they spending so much time in there ? i need my next fix !"
9841,lol that was pretty neat that the huddle was created by a deaf qb so the other team wouldn't steal his hand signals . it's been fun chatting with you !
9842,same here ! and perhaps soon we will see more than just one lefthanded qb . until then . . . may all your balls bounce the right way !
9843,hahaha that's great ! have a great night !
9844,you a sports fan ? i always wanted to be a quarterback ! the leader of the offense ! glorious job !
9845,i am not a football fan thoughi usually watch the super bowl whichisheld the first sunday in february .
9846,oh nice . yeah cool ! it is an exciting single elimination tournament indeed .
9847,and seeing the nfc and afc compete against each other is neat .
9848,yeah agreed . i think the nfl 17 wewk regular season should be shortened . it's too long and lots of injuries occur .
9849,i guess joe flacco was important for the ravens and was sitting out injured .
9850,yeah but it sounds like lamar jackson was doing well in his place .
9851,flacco is a former super bowl mvp but hasn't done as well in recent times .
9852,yeah i think he still has good potential though . i have faith in him as a qb . qb's sometimes don't do so well . just ask tom brady who didn't even start in high school on his jv team !
9853,"wow , interesting ! speaking of quarterbacks , i wonder why there is only one left handed quarterback it the nfl ."
9854,yeah that is a good question . . . not sure . did you know the circular huddle was invented so a deaf quarterback could give secret hand signals ?
9855,i did not know that . interesting . so russel wilson is a quarterback who used to play for the mlb . they still have him under contract even though he has not played in a regular season game since 2011 . he was even traded in 2018 to the yankees from the rangers .
9856,haha wow so odd . why doesn't he just cancel it ? baker mayfield was once a very good halo 3 player and it almost took over his life lol !
9857,"i am not sure i really understand the full story . brad johnson is another interestig one , only quarterback to have thrown a touchdown pass to himself ."
9858,that is a great accomplishment . what team was that for ? alex smith was a very smart high school student and he was drafted first overall in 2005 .
9859,"i'm not sure what team . speaking of high school , the football stadium in allen , tx is extravagant . it cost 60 million to build ."
9860,holy cow that is expensive . lot of guacamole . i wonder how big the serra high school stadium is ? that is where tom brady played .
9861,"it seats 18 , 000 ! wonder if they fill that up ."
9862,holy cats . that is really something . i wish that new orleans saints allowed their players to interact with players . such a weird rule . well it was so lovely talking with you today .
9863,seems like the nfl is filled with weird rules . nice talking to you today !
9864,bye !
9865,do you like football ?
9866,"yea , my favorite team is the giants but i follow all 32 nfl teams to a degree"
9867,i'm not too into football . maybe because there are only about 11 minutes of live gameplay per game .
9868,for 11 minutes of live gameplay the nfl sure has a lot of injuries
9869,"you are right ! it's amazing how much football has developed in popularity . in the 60s , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
9870,"yea , football is so popular espn won an emmy for creating the yellow first down line"
9871,and there are even tracking chips in footballs and shoulder pads
9872,"i wonder what the nfl does with all the data from those embedded chips , hopefully they use it for player safety"
9873,"yeah , hope so . there is so much competition in football to become a football player . maybe more people should aim to be engineers instead . over a lifetime their average earnings are higher ."
9874,"yea or they could study harder in school like alex smith did , he started college as a junior"
9875,yeah i like that he had a backup plan . benjarvus greenellis seems like he has always been sureof himself . he has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
9876,that is pretty impressive . i wonder if there will be any female players in the nfl since there is no rule banning them
9877,"yeah , i have heard there is an up and coming woman kicker . but in other ways the nfl seems sexist , like how saints cheerleaders must leave an establishment even if they are already eating , if saints players come in ."
9878,"yea that is a messed up rule , i wonder what would happen if the saints had female players on their team"
9879,"yeah , hopefully this changes ."
9880,did you know that baker mayfield considered quitting football to professionally play video games ?
9881,that seems kind of crazy but professional gaming can be lucrative as well .
9882,yea and less injuries playing halo 3 than professional football
9883,right ? it's surprising that tom brady kept believing in himself and not giving up and going to a different profession . when he was in high school his team refused to start him even though they had a terrible season .
9884,"yea , i disagree with tom brady's jv coach's decision to not switch qbs after failing to score a touchdown all season"
9885,yeah and now he is a four time super bowl champion . i'd be embarrassed if i were his hs coach !
9886,nick foles is a good players and the eagles are lucky to have him
9887,"i think so too , but they under utilize him in the regular season and that puts too much on wentz ."
9888,"they should start using him more , he has had a lot of brilliant moment on the league , they should exploit that"
9889,"absolutely . i understand that his track record when he was their starter was shaky , he has a 64 percent rating , but if they rotated him and wentz he would get more chances to play and increase his skill level ."
9890,"i guess he let down a lot of fans , wentz was the second overall pick in t he 2016 draft right ?"
9891,he was 2nd in that draft . but they could still be favorites they just have to prepare foles for atlanta .
9892,"seems like do you like the nfl a lot , any favorite teams ?"
9893,i am a pretty big football fan in general . i am a pittsburgh steeler fan . ben roethlisberger has the most wins of any quarterback . . . in cleveland !
9894,"i am a fan of the patriots , steelers have a rich history , how are they doing lately ?"
9895,this season could have been better . we were playing really well and at the top of the division but started losing to teams we should have easily beat . patriots ? have you ever been to a game ?
9896,"no , never , cant afford tickets so maybe one day , seems like a bit of a scam when there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay"
9897,"i know they are really expensive , but i hear it is a nice stadium . not big though . no nfl stadiums are really that large which is odd ."
9898,"have you been to a steelers game before ? and yeah stadiums are really big , the cost a lot too"
9899,"i have not . i live across the state so it would be an expensive weekend . i do go to penn state games though . ironically , they have the 2nd largest stadium in the country and their tickets are far less expensive than the nfl ."
9900,"i like college football , its a good thing you can get them for a good price ."
9901,"it makes me happy to be able to go to games . there is a big difference between live and watching on tv . i also went to the school with i believe the 2nd largest high school stadium in the country , after the allen , texas stadium ."
9902,"it is , games are more exiting , i am glad football exists , i wish i could afford to go to the super bowl maybe one day i can and maybe the pats will be playing that day ,"
9903,well you have had a lot of luck with them going these last few years ! i hope to go to the super bowl someday too . until then i guess i will stick to college games and try to get to pittsburgh !
9904,maybe they will play the super bowl against each other and we will be on opposing sides ! if thats the case may the best team win with no hard feelings
9905,"that can't happen , they are in the same league . the most we can see them play each other is during the regular season and in playoffs . and yes , no hard feelings ! they are two of the best franchises in the sport !"
9906,"oh i see , well in regular season then either way i hope you have a good night , bye"
9907,hello !
9908,hey how are you do you like nfl quarterbacks
9909,i do like nfl quarterbacks !
9910,me too i like kellan moore have you heard of him ?
9911,"i have heard of him , is he a quarterback ?"
9912,"he is and he is the only left handed quarterback , i think it gives him an advantage"
9913,"oh , wow . definitely interesting ! i find it funny that pro bowlers used to make twice the pay as football stars !"
9914,"that is funny , also weird that there are only 2 black quarterbacks that won the superbowl overall"
9915,"wow , that is interesting ! have you ever heard of al michaels ?"
9916,i have didn't he lose a bunch of weight recently ?
9917,"i am not sure , but he is well known for his on air gambling references between football teams"
9918,"oh i didn't know that , well do you like snoop dogg at all ?"
9919,"i do like snoop , didn't he write a fight song for his sons hs football team . . . ."
9920,"ya he did , i like his music , did you know the top paid employees of the dod are three football coaches , seems like a waste of money"
9921,"wow , i agree ! so something surprising i read is that in a football game . . . there's actually only 11 minutes of live play . . ."
9922,"ya that is surprising , did you hear a football stadium in texas cost 60 mil , and that it was for a highschool ? !"
9923,seriously ! that's strange ! have you heard of alex smith ?
9924,"i think so , hes like a genius right ? kinda like the guy who created the nfl's tracking chips"
9925,"yeah , he is smart and was the 1st overall pick in the 05 nfl draft . . . . . good thing he took the football path !"
9926,"ya i agree ! but ya the tracking chips can track the speed and rotation of the ball , kind of crazy ! i bet they get some cool stats"
9927,i bet they do too ! great invention ! too bad they didn't have that technology back in 1916 when that football game was played where georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 to 0 !
9928,"haha that could have turned the tide ! we've come a long way since then though , but still a huge american flag costs 50 , 000 now that is insane"
9929,"hi , do you like football ?"
9930,i don't not like football . . . i go to college games and i'll watch it when my husband is watching . do you like football ?
9931,"that's good . yes , i love football . did you know iowa painted their opposing team locker room pink ?"
9932,i have heard that . . . it's funny ! i guess it was a power play for them ? do you know that the highest scoring game ever was 2220 ?
9933,"wow , that's a very high scoring game . do you know what teams were in that game ?"
9934,"yeah , it was georgia tech to cumberland , back in 1916 . that was probably the most boring game to ever watch !"
9935,that would have been terrible to be on cumberland's team . how depressing .
9936,depressing and embarrassing !
9937,for sure . the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars .
9938,"wow , that's something ! i wonder what those stats are now . . . football stars probably make 5x what top bowlers make ! !"
9939,i wonder as well . greenellis who is a running back never fumbled his entire nfl career .
9940,with stats like that i hope he was the highest payed running back ! did you realize emmy's could be given to sports channels ?
9941,wow i had no idea . which sports channel received an emmy ?
9942,espn won an emmy for superimposing the yellow first down line onto the games !
9943,very cool . do you watch espn ?
9944,"i don't , we only have streaming services . do you watch espn ?"
9945,i don't watch it too often . do you like the nfl ?
9946,"i don't have a favorite team , but my husband likes the cowboys . did you know that women could play in the nfl ? they'd have to meet the league's eligibility requirements . . . but they could do it !"
9947,i bet they could do it too . i could see them being a kicker or something like that .
9948,"yeah , maybe ! i wonder what the league requirements are ? what i think about every time i watch an nfl game is that there is an average of only 11 minutes of actual gameplay . i just think about all that time that they're doing other stuff . . ."
9949,"i haven't heard of the league requirements . i can't believe it's only 11 minutes of actual gameplay . well , it was really good chatting with you . take care !"
9950,hi ! are you a football fan ?
9951,"i am , what about you ?"
9952,"yes , i am . what do you know about lamar jackson of the ravens ?"
9953,"i don't know much , even though baltimore is not too far ."
9954,"well , jackson is a former heisman trophy winning qb from louisville , who the ravens traded up to take in the first round of the draft ."
9955,"interesting , did he set any records while in school ?"
9956,"he sure did . only player in fbs history to rush for at least 1500 yds and pass for at least 3500 yds in a season , and he did that twice !"
9957,interesting . did you know that espn won an emmy for that yellow first down marker ?
9958,"yeah , , where would we be without it ! it is almost as important to football these days as the huddle , that ohsofamiliar circling up of players around the qb to hide signal calling ."
9959,did you know that in 60s bowlers made more than football stars ?
9960,where did bowlers go wrong ? apparently the popularity of football has exceeded bowling . i wonder if some other game will pass by football as the most popular soon ? perhaps gaming ? some pretty high profile college football players have considered not going pro in lieu of starting a career in gaming !
9961,"i think it just got old . if i were a college player and could go pro , i would go pro . you are only young once ."
9962,"yeah , but football makes you grow old more quickly than other games . . . if you are on the losing end of a lopsided loss , like the historic 2220 tarring georgia tech gave cumberland , you can grow old quickly . . ."
9963,"that's true , even though there is only 11 minutes of game play . pretty crazy , huh ?"
9964,you can beak your neck a thousand times over within that time . and the nfl will have the event recorded via tracking chips in your equipment so that they can tell how quickly the train that hit you was going . . .
9965,"i think they also put chips in the football as well , but i'm not entirely sure what for . any ideas ?"
9966,"to monitor speed , rotation , velocity , and location . heck , they even monitor the location of cheerleaders in new orleans , where they forbid them from dining in the same restaurant as any player . i wonder where they put the chips . . . in the pom poms ?"
9967,interesting . i think a lot of teams have that rule . did you know that there is no written rule against female players ?
9968,"yeah , but there are minimum eligibility requirements that still need to be met , which eliminate most men . . . so , i wonder what percentage of the women qualify ?"
9969,i think all they have to do is be good enough to play to be honest .
9970,"yeah , but good enough to play in the national football league is still a pretty high bar . i hope a lady does break that glass ceiling some day , and i also hope she keeps all of her teeth !"
9971,that it is . nice chatting with you .
9972,"hey there , do you follow the nfl ?"
9973,"i try to , wish the super bowl would have been better this year , was just boring to me ."
9974,yeah well when you think about it the game only lasts 11 minutes
9975,that is so unbelievable to me . apparently the nfl has had only one left handed quarterback . do you know who it is ?
9976,is that patriots greenellis ?
9977,no that's former patriot rb benjarvus he never fumbled the ball in his career .
9978,oh ok . was it kellan moore ?
9979,"yeah that's him , hard to believe that the nfl never produced another lefty ."
9980,yeah exactly there are so many players in there . did you know nfl is using chips on the player's padding ?
9981,for what ? they are taking technology to far .
9982,i think they record hits and their running to maybe work on better helmets and stuff
9983,just another way to spend money . did you know that in the 60's top bowler made more than top nfl players ?
9984,that is crazy . good thing they make more now to make a decent living
9985,speaking of football the iowa state universities visiting locker rooms are painted pink .
9986,i wonder if there is a reason for that . did you know espn won an emmy ?
9987,"espn , yeah didn't it have something to do with first downs ?"
9988,i think it was because the creation of the virtual superimposed yellow line
9989,oh yeah that's right made things easier if you were watching from home . 2200 was the highest scoring game in college football .
9990,what a win and a loss for the other team too
9991,"no that was the final score , i believe it was in 1916 . do you know the teams ?"
9992,what a difference . nice chatting with you
9993,the raiders are having some terrible luck .
9994,"yeah ! do you agree that khalil mack is the raiders' best player ? if you watch football , that is ."
9995,"yes i agree , i hope he stays healthy ."
9996,what happened to him ?
9997,he hurt his ankle back in november after the raiders traded him to the bears . i think they should of paid him what he was asking for .
9998,"oh yeah that's right ! i think so too , his playing style and speed makes his 100 million paycheck justified ."
9999,"yes , i do not see the raiders getting better any time soon ."
10000,"yeah , true that ! i had no idea that tracking chips were used by the nfl and embedded in shoulder pads to record every move on the field !"
10001,"thats very interesting , i knew they wore microphones but i did not know about that . did you know the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live play ?"
10002,that's it ? ! then why are these games taking up my entire afternoon and evenings !
10003,"commercials i would imagine , it is a business ."
10004,"oh , yeah ! there's only one lefthanded quarterback in the nfl ! i wonder if defensive plays accommodate that fact ."
10005,i am sure they have special plays for him . woman are allowed to play if they were to make it physically !
10006,oh wow ! has any woman ever played in the nfl ?
10007,i do not believe so but i do not new orleans saints cheerleaders can not dine at the same restaurant as players !
10008,do you know why that is ?
10009,i do not i would imagine they do not want them interacting on a personal level .
10010,i can't recall any cheerleaders who have ended up dating a football player on the same team . the giant flags at football stadiums weigh over 1000 pounds !
10011,"that is heavy , i would imagine dating the cheerleaders happens a lot . it is probably just frowned upon ."
10012,the atmosphere is susceptible to that since they travel together and are in the same environment a lot .
10013,"yes , great chatting with you i must run ."
10014,great chatting with you !
10015,have a good day .
10016,"hi , what do you think about this nhl rule ?"
10017,do you mean the nfl rule ?
10018,"yes of course , i think that the committee of this organization is aimed at very powerful people"
10019,"they do have a lot of influence , i agree ."
10020,if in reality they control the rules of the games and other people we can only observe and express their opinion
10021,it doesn't sound like that big of a rule change to me
10022,"soccer has hard punches , it is not a physical game nor is it for the weak of the heart . i think this statement is very true"
10023,i don't think hard punches are allowed in soccer
10024,"of course they do it , for you i have practiced it and it is very rude , you have played them ever"
10025,"well it should be called as a foul in soccer . if a ref saw you doing a hard punch to an opponent , you would be sent off ."
10026,"yes , there are faults that the referee does not see clearly"
10027,i think that some people who watch nfl don't want too many changes .
10028,"if so , others will change if they want innovation . what do you think of the university of iowa that give uniforms to visiting teams ?"
10029,"i did not know about that , why do they do it ?"
10030,"i meant to say that they painted the uniforms of the pink opponents , that was in the decade of the 60s"
10031,i don't think that is sportsmanlike !
10032,"if i think it goes against the morale of athletes , thank god those times will change"
10033,yes it would be humiliating . i don't think anyone would stand for it today .
10034,"sure . you think of paul hubbard , a field marshal who was deaf"
10035,that is impressive . maybe heard too many guns going off ?
10036,i do not think that for that reason i suffer from that condition . but what is important is that in the nfl allow to play this type of people
10037,i don't think it is a problem if a player is deaf .
10038,thanks for sharing your comments with me
10039,thank you also !
10040,are you interested about football and the nfl ?
10041,yes i am ! are you ?
10042,"i'm not too big a fan , but i have decent knowledge around it ."
10043,"same i'm not too big of a fan , yet i'm highly interested . such as , how is it okay to have the name redskins ? that's terribly racist . i thought we were ' advancing as a species ! '"
10044,"well of the 32 teams , its only 1 team that has a racist name . although that still isn't okay , i believe they will change it if asked to ."
10045,"i sure hope so ! so , i heard that the only left handed quarterback in the nfl is kellan moore . i wonder why there's so few left handed people in nfl ."
10046,"well , there are also no women in the nfl , even though they don't have a rule against it ."
10047,"really ? that's extremely intriguing ! i do know that the new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden to eat in a restaurant as any nfl player . if they are already eating and any nfl player comes in , the cheerleaders have to get up and leave !"
10048,"there are lots of interesting facts that go on behind the scenes , like the fact they use tracking chips on players and the footballs ."
10049,"oh yeah ! to track velocity , rotation , speed , etc . that's pretty smart of them !"
10050,"they also tracked the players movements and stuff , maybe that's where they get all the stats from ."
10051,oh yeah . i'm terrible at math so i think it's a good thing they have something like that in place . i'd imagine it would be impossible to track otherwise !
10052,"another weird fact is that in 1960 , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
10053,"interesting ! i can imagine that's not the case , these days ! former patriot's running back benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his entire nfl career !"
10054,i wonder how ? that sounds good when compared to the fact that people think alex smith can't carry the redskins .
10055,yeah it's quite a record to hold for benjarvus ! i just found out there is a such thing as gaelic football . how neat !
10056,"there are a lot of different kinds of football . rugby , soccer , australian football are some of them ."
10057,"yeah , it gets a little bit confusing , considering i call soccer , soccer ! the highest score ever in a football game was in 1916 , when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 !"
10058,"that's very interesting , sounds like cumberland suffered a huge loss . anyways , it was nice talking to you !"
10059,yeah ! huge loss ! it was very nice talking to you as well ! have a nice day and goodbye !
10060,goodbye !
10061,hi there how are you ? do you like the national football league ?
10062,"hi ! i am not a huge fan , especially with the ways some of the teams treat their cheerleaders . like the saints , the cheerleaders are not permitted to eat at the same restaurant as the players , and have to get up and leave if a player comes in ."
10063,"i don't like that rule . it seems very outdated and stupid personally , i think that the cheerleaders should sue"
10064,"they probably have some sort of weird nda . i'm waiting for a woman to be drafted , maybe then things will change ."
10065,yes i think we'll see that in our lifetime . i think that a woman would make a good kicker or something like that
10066,"i do too , especially since so many girls play soccer . it's so weird to think that other countries call soccer 'football ' ."
10067,"i agree with you . kind of crazy , the average nfl game only has about 11 minutes of gameplay that seems really low to me"
10068,"that does seem low . football is weird though , i still cannot believe espn won an emmy for creating those superimposed yellow lines ."
10069,no but that is a great invention ! also crazy that the nfl develop those tracking ships that they shoulder pads . have you heard about those ?
10070,"i have , some of the high schools are starting to use those . i think it's funny that the u of iowa's visiting locker room is painted pink . my son would get dressed in the hall ."
10071,i think that would actually make me play better personally . did you know back in the 1960s that football stars made about half what the top bowlers made
10072,"that is insane . kinda like that highschool coach who refused to put tom brady in , even though they hadn't won a game all season , or made a touchdown ."
10073,i bet that coaches kicking himself right now . i like the patriots . i also like the one running back was never fumble the football in his entire career
10074,"i bet he is too . i'm thankful for the coach who wouldn't let baker mayfield quit , to become a pro gamer . that's crazy too ."
10075,haha yeah he made the right decision . i was also really good at halo 3 haha . i would have liked to play him
10076,"i'm okay on that , i'm a fallout fan . i thought all nfl players were millionaires . it's weird that an engineer earns more than they do ."
10077,oh i like fallout a lot too . that is crazy with the pay as well . do you know how the football huddle was started ?
10078,wasn't it due to a player being deaf ?
10079,yes he was deaf . he use the huddle to cover up his hand sign so that the other team couldn't see it
10080,that was smart of him . i finally saw colin kaepernick's nike ad . it was interesting .
10081,i have not seen that . i wish i could have seen the highest scoring football game ever . i guess that it was 222 to 0 haha
10082,"hello , do you like football ?"
10083,not really . i watch it because my kids do . i was not impressed that espn won an emmy for those superimposed lines .
10084,"oh really , i know my family loves football and goes to the games . i didn't realize there is only 11 minutes of live game play . but it makes sense ."
10085,i think its hilarious that the top bowlers in the 60's made more than football players .
10086,"i know , right ! thinking the visiting teams don't like the pink locker rooms at the university of iowa ."
10087,"that is just dumb , lol . is it true that the highest score ever was 2220 ? makes you wonder why the coaches didn't stop the game ."
10088,i was thinking the same . why sit there that long never getting ahead . but that was 1916 .
10089,was that georgia tech ?
10090,"yeah , they need to change that rule that the cheerleaders have to leave the restaurant if a nfl player comes in ."
10091,i agree . baker mayfield almost didn't become a brown's player . he wanted to become a competitive player .
10092,"really , they must feel there's too much togetherness in the same restaurant . lol"
10093,"i think it's archaic and insulting . especially since they have to get up and leave , even if they haven't finished their meal ."
10094,omg ! yes . . . . at least have a plan before you got to the restaurant to prevent it .
10095,alex smith entered college as a junior . that's awesome he was able to take so many ap tests in high school .
10096,"agree , he's smart too ! didn't know a deaf quarterback created the circular huddle . those hand signals ."
10097,"that is interesting . what do you think of the tracking chips in the balls ? seriously , those should have been used on ' deflate gate ' ."
10098,you're right ! and the shoulder pads . great for tracking . i thought there was more than just one left handed quarterback .
10099,"i wouldn't know . i only follow baker mayfield , as i too am good at halo 3"
10100,"lol , really ! yeah , understand that ! have a nice night ! good chat ! !"
10101,"thanks , you too"
10102,enjoy playing halo ! !
10103,"hey there , do you like the nfl ?"
10104,"hey , i like and pay some attention . how about you ? do you watch nfl ?"
10105,yeah from time to time mainly superbowl . i mean it is only 11 minutes of actual game
10106,it's very surprising about 11 minutes . have you ever been on stadium ?
10107,no i just watch it from the tv . how about you ?
10108,"i also just watch . did you know that the nfl has no any written restrictions against female players , but they have to meet some requirements . i'm wondering what kind of requirements it could be"
10109,i tihink as long as they can pass the test like male players do they can play . i am not sure though
10110,i also know that nfl player makes less that an engineer if we check lifelong time . it's something i also didn't know .
10111,yeah you think they get paid a lot but they do not really
10112,"it's just surprising , because there lot of money in this industry . really really a lot"
10113,yeah . did you know about that rule of cheerleaders for the saints not being able to eat in the same restaurant as the players ?
10114,"it sounds really weird . what if they already here with friends , family , etc ? just stupid rule . it doesn't make sense for me ."
10115,me either so strange . did you know university of iowa locker room is pink ?
10116,"no , i didn't know . i didn't know that the highest score in history of football was 2220 , but long time ago . did you know that ?"
10117,no that must have been a really terrible loss . who was playing ?
10118,georgia tech against cumberland . georgia won
10119,wow good for them what a win . do you have a favorite player position in the nfl ?
10120,not really . i guess every position has some interesting aspects . but i know a lot of people like quarterback
10121,yeah that is for sure . do you know alex smith ?
10122,"yes , i know something , but not a lot . do you know something interesting about him ?"
10123,he graduated in two years from college . it was nice chatting with you
10124,hello ! are you getting as excited for the nfl playoffs as i am ?
10125,"i am , who are you a fan of ?"
10126,"i know that a lot of people don't like them , but probably the new england patriots . speaking of the pats , tom brady wasn't even put in as qb on his jv team in hs that lost all of their games !"
10127,"that is kinda crazy , alex smith entered college as a junior and got his bachelors in 2 years , made his college qb career short ."
10128,"that is pretty amazing . i think he still had some eligibility , but to think of graduating in two years ! or you could be like baker mayfield who almost became a fulltime gamer !"
10129,makes you think some people are just good at everything . did you know that there was once a deaf quarterback ?
10130,"there was a deaf defensive lineman at nebraska , but didn't know about a quarterback . how did he communicate with his teammates ?"
10131,"he used hand signals , that is where the huddle originated , to prevent others from seeing his signals ."
10132,"that is really interesting . as the leader of the team , i bet that really helped get everyone in sync !"
10133,"right ! interesting fact , there has only been one left handed qb in the nfl , kellan moore . i wonder why that is ."
10134,"i think he is the only one right now . i am pretty sure there were others , but maybe there just aren't a lot of great ones coming out of college ?"
10135,"that would make more sense . soeaking of college football , here in iowa we have the visiting teams locker room painted pink ."
10136,i am actually in nebraska so i knew about our rivals' pink locker room . it's amazing what teams will due to get an edge .
10137,"isn't it . hey you mentioned liking the patriots , i can't believe that greenellis has never fumbled the ball in his entire career , that is amazing ."
10138,it's pretty much unheard of . to think if it was the 1960s these players would be making less than top bowlers .
10139,bowlers make nothing compared to nfl players . but their careers are usually so short and they certainly make the teams money .
10140,"they really invest in these players , but you are correct . the average earnings of an engineer over his life is more than an nfl player ."
10141,really weird to think of it that way . i think antonio brown may have shortened his career a lot after this weekend .
10142,"he's an elite player , but obviously has some real issues with tomlin and the steelers ."
10143,"you know your football . i hope that he finds a home where he is comfortable . steelers are out now anyhow , guess i'll watch hockey ."
10144,hockey is fun too and i usually wish i watched it more . have a good one !
10145,do you pay attention to the nfl playoffs at all ?
10146,yes i do .
10147,"which of the teams were you rooting for this year ? i watched a few of the games , and there was a lot of potential in a lot of the teams that makes me want to keep my eye out for them next season"
10148,i thought the rams were a good contender and also the kansas city chiefs . i think it all boils down to what quarterback has a good passer rating .
10149,true ! it definitely would have been interesting had it been the chiefs against the rams . the qb is key in those games though
10150,i know what you mean . take andrew luck for example . he's the quarterback for the colts and he's the 10th most valuable passer of the year .
10151,i wonder if the fact that kellan moore is the only lefty nfl qb affects how the team has been doing the past few years
10152,"could be , then again perhaps not . there has been a deaf quarterback back in the day . he's the whole reason the teams get into huddles ."
10153,i wonder how well that team did overall . he seems like the kind of guy who could adjust well to the circumstances around him
10154,yes he does and the team with him . they figured out that by huddling they could keep opponents from reading his hand signals .
10155,"some football players are smart like that . for instance , alex smith was working on his master's degree by the time he was in the nfl draft because he started college as a junior"
10156,he started college as a junior ? i guess he was really working in high school not just on football but on education too .
10157,"i guess if you take all the ap classes while in high school , college can be shortened by two years . he must have been a good player too to be the first overall pick in 2005"
10158,"speaking of good players , have you heard of baker mayfield ? not only is he a great quarterback but also a great gamer . he thought about going professional on video game competitions ."
10159,"football probably pays more though , and gaming is a good plan b if the nfl route doesn't work out"
10160,that's true . football pays good now but in the 1960s bowlers made more than players .
10161,"do professional bowlers still make money nowadays ? it seems that espn has changed the popularity of football , especially with that first down line they invented that made it easier to viewers to keep track of the game"
10162,it definitely does . i think it adds to the excitement too because you know just how far they have to go to get their first down .
10163,it was a good enough invention to win an emmy . sometimes it's the simple things that make a difference
10164,that's true lol ! do you watch any college football ? they had the highest scoring game ever .
10165,"i don't , but wasn't it back when georgia tech played cumberland in 1916 ?"
10166,"it was , georgia tech scored 222 unanswered points !"
10167,i feel bad for the guys on cumberland's team . at some point they must have given up
10168,good evening !
10169,"good evening , i can not believe that the bengal line backer has not been suspended for the late hit on antonio brown during the pitsburgh's win sunday !"
10170,strange that the super bowl is now over and the burfict issue comes out again . he played college ball out here and was just as volatile as he is now probably will get kicked out of the league soon .
10171,"yeah , i agree it is too bad that the burfit issue is arising again . it was a little childish of him to lie and accuse smith schuster of spitting on them"
10172,he's a menace and a liability for the nfl who are trying the move away from the dirty players and appeal more to mom's who don't want their kids to play because it's too violent
10173,"yeah i agree , it is too bad that it is appealing more to mom's who do not want their children to play football due to the violent nature of the sport that is promoted on social media . it is interesting to note that there has been discussion about how the nfl should possible consider increasing rules about hitting players that are not quarterbacks ."
10174,"yeah , they're stuck in a tight spot and if you make the game safer and less violent , they may lose fans . but if you don't have kids playing football anymore , they wont grow up to be nfl players their talent pool dries up !"
10175,"i agree , we need kids to playing football and they need good role modles to teach them how good sportsmanship ! i would also love to see more females players on the football team because technicallywomen are allowed to play on the team as long as they meet the league's eligibility requirements ."
10176,"interesting point about women , i didn't think about that angle . i know some women have been college kickers and had aspirations to play professionally"
10177,"yeah , i think it is really too bad that they are not considering female athletes who are just as capable as men in the sport . young female youth need more female athletes as their role models that they can aspire to be like ."
10178,"totally agree , i have two daughters and love the role models they have in soccer and basketball now . it would blow their minds to see a woman on the football field . i think it's great that they have female refs or officials in the nfl and nba"
10179,"i agree , having female refs or officials in nfl and nba is a great start , but i definitely would love to see more athletes . another interesting fact is that the iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink ."
10180,what ? that's pretty sexist and demeaning regardless the sport . i would think that will be repainted soon in today's climate i don't like it !
10181,"really ? i kind of disagree , because i think it is a smart strategy that they use in order to give themselves an advantage during the game . therefore , from a game point perspective painting your opposing team's locker room pink is a great move !"
10182,interesting point any advantage a home team can get over their opponent . i was thinking it may be antiquated in today's pc climate .
10183,"that is a very good point , it would really be interesting to see data about how the opposing team is impacted . for example , maybe they could analyze the tracking chips found on the shoulder pads to record a player's every move on the field ."
10184,ii would think there would need to be a psychological measurement of the affect of the pink walls . i've heard about the chips in the padding and i wonder why they don't put chips in the ball to indicate if a ball breaks the plain of the endzone or sideline ?
10185,"apparently they do use the tracking devices inside footballs to track the ball's velocity , rotation , ball speed and location . i guess they do not advertise that as much during official games though ."
10186,"fascinating how technologically advanced the game is in some aspects , but antiquated in officiating where they missed 3 penalties on one play in that saintsrams game !"
10187,yeah i can't believe that they missed that even though the technology has become so advanced . you would expect them to track all this data especially when there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
10188,that stat has always baffled me 11 min of action . so much downtime and wasted time !
10189,"i agree , that would explain why the superbowl commercials are so popular . it is because most of the game is just watching advertisements , with only 11 minutes of real live action ."
10190,super bowl commercials were soso this year . the burger king or andy warhol one was the most memorable one for the wrong reasons !
10191,"i did not watch the super bowl commercials this year , but heard that they were very boring . a lot of my friends told me it sucked this year and was a waste of time to watch"
10192,"overall your friends are correct . i wasn't a fan of either team and watched it with friends , beers , food , good times terrible game !"
10193,"that's disappointing to hear , hopefully next year it will be a better game !"
10194,maybe but i wouldn't be surprised if it was the patriots again . . . winning . . . boring as it might be
10195,"yeah , they are a tough team to beat . maybe one player will decide to quit like baker mayfield did in order to pursue a fulltime competitive career in gaming . that may give he other teams a chance to make it to the super bowl !"
10196,i had no idea that mayfield wanted to quit football and be a pro gamer where would the browns be without him ! ? ! ? !
10197,"i agree , in fact mayfield even boasts that he can beat anyone at the game of halo 3 if they played against him in 1 on 1 game"
10198,"that's crazy , even though i have not idea about halo 3 , he's a pretty good qb"
10199,"yeah , i agree , he has been a great quarterback since he was at the university of oklahoma ."
10200,"he's great . hey , it's been awesome chatting with you !"
10201,"yeah , he is , i would also love to see more left anded quarterbacks . i fins it fascinating that kellan moore is the only one on the nfl who is left handed"
10202,i'm not sure i know who kellan moore plays for ! ? ! ? !
10203,good afternoon . do you like the nfl ?
10204,hi how are you ? i sometimes watch the nfl . you ?
10205,yes i usually watch every sunday although i didn't watch all 17 regular season games this year .
10206,i didnt get a chance to watch this year . i heard the game was a bit slow .
10207,yes it was . the super bowl that is . did you know there's only actually 11 minutes of life gameplay ?
10208,i heard that . it seems too little for so much money . i guess there is alot of time for commercials .
10209,yes i very much dislike commercials . did you know the nfl has no written rule against female players ?
10210,i cant imagine a woman playing in a game with such big guys . seems dangerous .
10211,yes it seems very dangerous . cheerleading isn't dangerous though . although the new orleans saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player .
10212,that rules is outdated and sexist . it must be from long ago .
10213,yes it really is . it needs to be changed ! the average lifetime earnings of engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player .
10214,"i would feel more comfortable if women had careers with less physical risk , like engineering . less chance for concussions as well ."
10215,yes absolutely . it is a tough game . i'm glad they get paid so much but in the past professional bowlers made twice as much !
10216,that was a golden age for bowling . that will never return . i guess i was born late lol
10217,you a big bowler ? i think it's a fun sport . former nfl running back greenellis never once fumbled the football ! i wonder if he is good at bowling ?
10218,he probably would have trouble letting go of the ball ! lol
10219,ha ha yes good point . you know that circular huddle ? that was started by a deaf quarterback .
10220,a deaf quarterback ? why would he need a circular huddle ?
10221,good question . so the other team cannot read his hand signals . it was really lovely chatting with you today .
10222,that makes sense . i guess he would need to do that . i enjoyed chatting too .
10223,have a good one !
10224,"hi , do you watch football ?"
10225,"yes i do , i follow the nfl closely what about you ?"
10226,from time to time . did you ewatch the superbowl ?
10227,"i did watched the superbowl my favorite team was playing , did you watch it ? did anything special for the game ?"
10228,we had a party so that was enjoyable . did you know women can play ?
10229,"they can play ? thats new for me , you know players have chips in their shoulders !"
10230,"yeah that is so cool , can collect lots of statistics"
10231,"i agree , it is cool , cool how tech can be implemented to a game , footballs also have tracking chips and you can learn all kinds of interesting stats out of them ."
10232,yeah . did you know engineers earn more than football players
10233,"i didnt , football players earn a lot of money so thats hard to believe i guess engineers also make a lot of money"
10234,yeah they do and i find that really fair actually
10235,"i think its fair as well afterall engineers study for a long time , its fair like espn winning an emmy for the yellow line that represents first down on football"
10236,yeah i guess . do you know the highest score of a football game ?
10237,"i dont , whats the highest score in a football game ?"
10238,"2220 , that was a crazy win and loss for the other team"
10239,"wow , that is a ridiculous win 2220 , what team was bad enough to lose by that score ?"
10240,"georgia tech beat the cumberlands , what a win"
10241,"i agree , did cumberland retire from football after that defeat ? i know i would lol"
10242,"must have , i have no idea really ?"
10243,"i see , well did you ever watched benjarvus green ellis play ?"
10244,no but i know he never fumbled a football . nice chat
10245,"hey there , do you watch the nfl ?"
10246,"i do . some call it the national football league . i call it the never football league , since they only actually play a few minutes in each game ."
10247,i know only 11 minutes of play time yet we are glued to the tv for so long watching those 11 minutes
10248,"over 17 weeks , that means one team only plays 189 minutes per year . and if you are a punter , maybe 3 minutes ?"
10249,something like that . did you know women can actually play if they want
10250,like any sane woman would want that ? you know they televise the players age and weight every week ?
10251,i think it is more about the violence in the sport . it is a dangerous sport really
10252,yes it is . they put tracking chips in the helmets so that they can tell the spouses the precise velocity of the helmet that caused the concussion .
10253,yeah the technology even for sports has come a really long way now
10254,"yeah , they monitor the speed of the football , the location of every player , and whether cheerleaders are in the same retaurant as the players . . . a nono if you are a saint !"
10255,i find that really strange and they even have to leave midmeal if the players walk in
10256,"i hope they at least get a doggie bag ! bowlers don't have to put up with such rules ! you know , back in the day , bowlers made more money than nfl players , but that was years ago . . ."
10257,"yeah that is interesting too . speaking of football , espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line"
10258,a virtual line . that means they got an emmy for nothing . the players do all the work and they get recognized for imaginary lines .
10259,i know right ? do you have a favorite player position in nfl ?
10260,"depends on the team . 32 teams and they all play the game a little diferent . on a runningcentric team , i admire the tailback and fullback positions , as well as the offensive linemen . on a throwing team , the qb is often the most admired . how about you ?"
10261,yeah i am going to go witht he quarterback too . did you know brady was never put in the game in high school
10262,"wow . epic fail for that coach . you know , brady's fellow teammate , ellisgreen , never fumbled the ball even once during his entire career as a running back with the patriots ? that is admirable !"
10263,i know that is . do you know alex smith ?
10264,smart dude ! he had earned so many ap credits in hs that the college took him as a junior . now he uses his brain in the huddle as qb in the nfl . . .
10265,good for him talent and brains . nice chatting with you
10266,"hello there , are you an nfl fan ?"
10267,i am ! i like how ben roethlisberger has the most franchise wins for the browns and he plays for the steelers lol . are you ?
10268,yeah big ben sure has dominated the browns his whole career . i am a fan yeah but mostly of my fav team .
10269,who is your favorite team ? mine is the vikings !
10270,nice ! mine is the packers so we have had our fair share of good games .
10271,i agree ! i remember when brad johnson played for the vikings . he is the only quarterback to throw a touchdown pass to himself !
10272,"yeah i remember that ! i was a big brett favre fan myself , he had some good games for your vikings ."
10273,even better days with the packers haha . i do like watching college too . can you believe 14 of the world's 25 biggest stadiums are for college teams ?
10274,"that is pretty crazy , did you know the visitors locker room at iowa is pink ?"
10275,yes i've actually been in it ! very cool and funny at the same time . it's not as cool as that high school stadium in allen texas that cost 60 million dollars to build !
10276,holy crap that is just insane ! i don't think other colleges or high schools around the world have such big stadiums .
10277,"makes you wonder if they could have spent it elsewhere , or even if they are good haha . i can't believe matt patricia was a rocket scientist before the nfl !"
10278,"wow that is very interesting , rocket scientist to football , what a switch !"
10279,you would think he would get bored coaching at that point haha . i also can't believe there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl .
10280,"that is a crazy fact about the nfl , do you know the story behind the invention of the huddle ?"
10281,wasn't it formed because of a deaf quarterback ? i forget his name though !
10282,"paul d . hubbard , yeah good call ! i think that is probably the coolest fact about football ."
10283,i wonder if they ran around to each player to give them the play back then haha . do you know how they stretch the flag across the field every game ?
10284,"yeah thats a good question lol . i'm not sure , do you know ?"
10285,with a lot of people haha . it weights 1100 pounds and cost 50000 to make !
10286,"holy crap ! well it's been fun and interesting talking with you , i hope you have a good day ."
10287,"hi , do you watch football ?"
10288,"yes i do , what about you ? do you like it ? follow it ?"
10289,sometimes . did you know women can play ?
10290,i didn't but i guess i'm not suprised because it makes sense that people might be concerned for a woman's safety in football . it's amazing how much we spend on stadiums
10291,that is true . do you know how much game play there is in a game ?
10292,"i dont know , maybe 40 minutes i guess 5 minutes arent really gameplay but ads ."
10293,"yeah that is for sure , lots of downtime there"
10294,"yeah , there is a lot of wasted time in games , its unbelievable how much the flags at football stadiums weight !"
10295,for sure . do you know abot that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
10296,"no , what rule do they have concerning cheerleaders ?"
10297,they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players
10298,"that is really unfair , that rule should be eliminated and the team should receive a fine for even having a rule like that , it makes me so angry !"
10299,me too it is so sexist . the worst is they have to leave mid meal too
10300,"i agree , so do you know who kellan moore is ?"
10301,is that the only quarterback that is left handed ?
10302,"he is , the only left handed of the league , brad johson is another curious character , how did he manage to give himself a touchdown pass lol"
10303,"i would really like to see that , how he did i"
10304,"i wonder if the video is available at youtube , another interesting fact is that only two african american quarterbacks have actually won the superbowl"
10305,yeah that is curious for sure . there are so many players of color
10306,"yeah dough williams and rrussel wilson apparently both of them played against the broncos , theres another interesting fact about rusell , want to know more about him ?"
10307,sure what else do you know ?
10308,ok so he is still under a mlb contract even though he has not played in regular season since 2011 and even got traded in 2018
10309,do you like football ?
10310,"hey there , yes i do i like kellan moore espeically"
10311,i hear he is the only left handed qb in the nfl .
10312,"yup thats true , i think it give him an advantage , do you know the history of the circular huddle ?"
10313,"no , what is it ?"
10314,"it was a deaf quarterback , he'd use it to cover up his signing from teh opposite team"
10315,"interesting , so they had to hide the hand signals ?"
10316,"yup exactly , did you hear that baker mayfield was almost a professinoal gamer instead of a quarterback ?"
10317,"no , i wonder how much he would have made ? it can pay fairly well ."
10318,"ya i agree , did you know how popular bowling was in the 60's ?"
10319,it was so popular that bowlers made more than football players .
10320,"yup twice as much , do you like the patriots ? they have a player who has never fumbled"
10321,"i'm not a fan , i don't hate them , but they aren't my team ."
10322,what do you think about the highest scoring football game of all time ? the score was 2220 thats crazy
10323,"i can't believe it , given that the average game only has 11 minutes of gameplay ."
10324,"thats true , that seems so low though , kind of like the lifetime earnings of an nfl player compared to an engineer"
10325,"i'm not surprised , engineers can make a lot and bad football players make very little ."
10326,"that is true , what do you think of the strange rules with the saints cheerleaders and players ?"
10327,"i think that rule , while strange is pretty common , they have it for my home team too ."
10328,oh
10329,well nice chatting with you !
10330,"well , hello there ! how's it going ? ready to chat ? do you like that there football ?"
10331,"hi there , yes i do like football . did you know women can play in nfl too ?"
10332,i've heard as much . but will the day ever come ?
10333,"i am not sure actually , we will have to see . i mean all they have to do is play for 11 minutes"
10334,11 minutes of action . years of training . maybe women could be kickers or something . maybe men could be cheerleaders too .
10335,yeah why not . did you know engineers actually earn more over the lifetime than football players ?
10336,"engineers are in demand ! women should become engineers , not football players ! fewer concussions ."
10337,yeah and better pay it seems . i guess it makes sense since the career of a football player is shorter too
10338,the career is short and dangerous . hard to be an engineer when your brain is broke . what do you think of u of iowa's little trick ?
10339,hm curious about it . i know pink can be distracting so i wonder if that was the reason
10340,"pink was meant to calm them down , turn them in pacifists ! it didn't work as far as i can see . they didn't win no emmy for a pink locker room ."
10341,true . what do you think about espn winning an emmy though for the superimposed yellow line ?
10342,"that is the highlight of espn's career . they will never exceed that achievement . in fact , tv will never get better than that . a yellow line ! imagine !"
10343,"i know . i find it kind of strange but as well , good for them . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?"
10344,is he a football player or something ?
10345,yeah he played for the patriots and is the only guy to have never fumbled the ball in his career
10346,i hope that he got a bonus for such outstanding play ! must have been tough . everybody probably tried to get him to fumble .
10347,"yeah , that is true . did you know bowlers used to make more than football players ?"
10348,"bowlers have the ideal athletic build , that's why . beer and pizzas and big shiny ones . that's all you needed back in the 1960s ."
10349,i guess that explains it . do you know what the highest score in football history is ?
10350,"no i don't , what is it ?"
10351,"it was pretty high for sure , 2220 , that is insane . nice chat"
10352,do you like football ?
10353,"i have never been fond of sports in general . are you referring to gridiron foot ball , like we have in"
10354,"yes , i am . i'm not such a fan of football either . football has gained so much popularity in the last few decades . in the 60s , topbowlers made twice as much as the top football stars ."
10355,"a current nfl player makes less in a lifetime than an engineer , but an nfl player probably works alot less years ."
10356,that's true . the football players have to learn to manage their money well for the rest of their lives . i assume that's difficult for many .
10357,"that is probably true for most sports , the engineer makes more than a mlb in their liftimes ."
10358,following everything that goes on on the field in football is hard for me when i watch . sometimes i wonder how scoring can be objective . it's interesting to know that players and footballs have tracking chips .
10359,having the yellow line for the first down makes it easier to watch .
10360,"yes , you're right about that . it's interesting that espn won an emmy for creating that !"
10361,the technology makes it more fun and easier to follow . i wonder what they use the the chips in foot balls and shoulderpads to do .
10362,"the shoulder pad chips record the players every move and the footballs have tracking for velocity , ball speed , rotation and location . technology is neat !"
10363,they spend lots of effort to track stuff in the 11 minute or so of live game play .
10364,"right , it is crazy how little game play there actually is . maybe that's part of the reason i do not like football ."
10365,"the quarterback touches the football for most offensive plays , but that doesn't mean the other players have much contact with the ball in the 11 minutes ."
10366,there is a lot of pressure on being a quarterback . i guess that's why they are paid more .
10367,"it was a deaf quarterback who invented the circular huddle , so the other team couldnt read his signals ."
10368,that's interesting to know and cool that they continue to use this method .
10369,"most quarterbacks are right handed , there is only one leftie currently in the nfl ."
10370,interesting . i wonder why that is . do you think that pep talks help lead into victory ? swearinger of the redskins certainly does . his teammates say he is a fire starter and a maniac but it seems to help them win .
10371,usuaal calling a person ' crazy ' and a ' fire starter ' are not compliments but his teammate used those phrases as a compliment .
10372,right . it's fun to see how passionate some nfl players are about their game .
10373,are you a football fan ?
10374,some what but i don't get to watch it anymore like i use to .
10375,i hear that . out of the 32 teams do you have a favorite ? i'm a steelers fan .
10376,i was green bay when i watched . they have 16 weeks of game play and each team gets a week off .
10377,nice . i like how green bay is owned by the community . the nfl has no written rule against female players . maybe one day we'll see one on the field . maybe as a kicker ?
10378,that's possible although im surprised we haven't already . personally i think they should have their own league like the wnba .
10379,they did at one time . i used to watch it a few years ago but it seemed like it was more for show . they wore shoulder pads but at the same time they were wearing shorts to show off their legs . can't remember the league name . did you know that there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay in an average nfl game ?
10380,i did know that and it is hard to believe . the tracking chips are also in the footballs as well as the shoulder pads .
10381,seems like they are getting way too deep analyzing the game . did you know that espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line ?
10382,"i did and that line brought me great joy , lol . the super bowl is usually played the first week of february ."
10383,yes . i look forward to the super bowl every year . do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was ?
10384,i do not . was it a college or pro game ?
10385,it was a college game in 1916 . georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 . talk about a blowout .
10386,"wow , i would have not wanted to be on that bus ride home and sure it was the longest ride ever . you know that the iowa universities visiting locker room is painted pink ?"
10387,lol yes . they must have did that to try to mess with the opponants . how about patriots rb benjarvus greenellis ? he has never fumbled the ball once during his career !
10388,now that is an achievement ! do you know if he is in the hall of fame for that ?
10389,i don't know . curious to find out though . there is only one left handed qb in the nfl and that is kellan moore . i'm not familiar with him .
10390,me either . did you know at one point bowlers made twice as much as top nfl players ?
10391,i didn't . i wonder what the pay difference is now ? did you know that the circular huddle was created by paul hubbard who was deaf so the other team could not read his hand signals ?
10392,oh ok that makes sense . it was in the 60's that top bowler made twice as much . i doubt that they make any where as much as them now .
10393,i bet they are nowhere close . lol baker mayfield almost quit football to pursue a full time career in competitive video game playing . that would have been crazy . it was nice chatting with you .
10394,hello do you watch football ? ?
10395,hey there i watch football from time to time . i watch the super bowl for instance . what about you . what do you like to watch ?
10396,"i dont really follow football , but i watch the 49ers sometimes ."
10397,yeah i'm in michigan so i mostly watched the lions . although they suck haha . i do like tom brady though . apparently there are different variations of football . did you know that ?
10398,different variations ? what do you mean ?
10399,"there are other variations of football such as australian rules , rugby football , or gaelic football . i don't know how those work but they are different versions for sure"
10400,oooh i see . i thought u meant in american football
10401,haha nope . i must have misspoke maybe haha . do you like snoop dogg ? he made a fight song for his son's football team
10402,"i used to like some of his music , that is pretty cool of him to do that ."
10403,yeah it is . would you go to a football stadium that cost 60 million to build ? even if it was for a high school ?
10404,yeah probably just to see what it looked like . football generates so much money .
10405,yep it does . it's also crazy that 14 of the 25 largest stadiums in the world are all american football team stadiums
10406,"that is impressive . although , football is not popular all over the world so i guess that makes sense ."
10407,no you're right . do you know the department of defense ? the top three most high salary employees are all football coaches somehow
10408,football coaches are part of the department of defense ? since when ?
10409,yeah i know right . that's definitely a lot of taxpayer money . what about quarterbacks . do you like any of them ?
10410,i dont know many current quarterbacks except tom brady and eli manning .
10411,yep i like tom brady a lot . i also know there's a quarterback named kellen moore and he's lefthanded . the only lefthanded player in the league
10412,wow thats pretty weird stat . i cant believe theres only one left handed qb in the whole nfl .
10413,"i know right . i wonder if it gives him an advantage or not . also weird stat , only two black quarterbacks have ever won the super bowl . i wonder why that is what do you think"
10414,its been good chatting .
10415,hello are you a fan of the nfl ?
10416,not really . football seems overly complicated to me and it doesn't seem like there's even that much playing going on in a typical game
10417,no . that's becasue there's only 11 minutes of actual gameplay during a game . who do you think makes more over their careers . . an engineer or an average nfl or mlb player ?
10418,"if i had to guess , i'd say an engineer . they provide valuable services to our society and sports players are trained athletes but their jobs are really to entertain us"
10419,you're right ! they make more over a lifetime . did you know that the nfl has no written rule prefenting female players from playing ? i wonder if we'll see one any time soon ?
10420,"really ? i always assumed they did , like mlb . that's why women can only play softball ."
10421,"i'm thinking that maybe we'll see one get in there as a kicker . did you know that they put tracking chips in the footballs to record data like velocity , rotation , etc ?"
10422,"i didn't know that , but it makes sense after ' deflategate . ' i don't think we'll see a woman playing anytime soon , though ."
10423,maybe they would like to play at the university of iowa where they visiting locker room is painted pink . wonder why they did that ?
10424,"maybe to sike them out . although maybe that backfired if it's hot pink , that's a very stimulating color , and pale pink is very relaxing . should have painted it orange which is offputting"
10425,true . i was thinking maybe for breast cancer awareness . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars of that era .
10426,"i guess people had better attention spans then and wanted to watch a slowermoving sport . people back in the day weren't too smart , though . a high school football team had a terrible season and never even thought to use their second string players and one of those was the tom brady ."
10427,wow . i didn't know that . speaking of something terrible . . . . cumberland must have felt like that after georgia tech beat them 2220 in 1916 .
10428,"i think that's called a shutout , right ? hopefully they've recovered in the 100 plus years since then lol"
10429,lol benjarvus greenellis must have been pretty good . the former patriots running back never fumbled the ball once during his career . that seems impressive .
10430,even more impressive : espn won an emmy just for superimposing a yellow line on their broadcast . must've been the early days of special effects
10431,yes . amazing how far tv graphics have come . qb baker mayfield almost quit football to pursue competitive gaming full time . that wouldn't have been a smart move .
10432,competitive gaming ? like video games ?
10433,yes . isn't that crazy ?
10434,"it is . i mean , he would've sustained less brain damage had he gone that route . long term issues from head injuries in nfl players is a huge issue"
10435,yes . they seem like they are taking steps to address it . i have to get running . loved chatting with you ! have a great day !
10436,"hello , do you like football ?"
10437,yea but i don't know if alex smith is a better qb than kirk cousins like coach gruden said
10438,"hmmm i'm not sure , i dont know kirk cousins ."
10439,"he was traded to the minnesota vikings , cousins didn't really have a good season"
10440,oh i see . i hear alex smith took so many ap tests in high school he entered a university as a jounior .
10441,"yea alex smith is really smart , before he was drafted he started a master's degree"
10442,thats impressive .
10443,"tom brady is a pretty smart qb too , it's a shame he never got to start for his jv high school team"
10444,"yeah their loss , they might have won that season lol"
10445,"or at least score a touchdown , hopefully jinipero serra high fired that coach"
10446,"apparently , there is only one left handed qb in the nfl"
10447,"yea , kellan moore , i actually saw him on one of the football show on espn not too long ago"
10448,oh nice ! does he still play ?
10449,"i really don't know if kellan moore still plays , i think he's just espn's only left handed football analyst"
10450,thats cool . did you know in the 60's top bowlers made almost twice as much as football players ?
10451,"nope , i knew in the 60s football players weren't paid much but i didn't know bowlers made more"
10452,"kinda crazy , considering football players pretty much risk their health every game ."
10453,"yea and an nfl game only averages 11 minutes of live gameplay , boxers go longer than that"
10454,"yeah 11 min over a span of 3 hours , thats really long ."
10455,"yea , i wonder if they will ever have females player in the nfl since there are no rules against it"
10456,"that would be something . i guess if she is qualified i say let her play . its been great chatting , i learned a lot ."
10457,do you like american football ?
10458,"oh yeah , i am a huge fan ! i am a packers fan so aaron rogers is my quarterback ."
10459,"nice . quarterbacks seem to tend to have a higher iq than a lot of other positions , which makes sense since they are in a leadership role for the offensive team ."
10460,"yeah , that is a good point . they have to learn all of the plays for the entire team . the qb is the one guy who knows everything going on or at least is suppose to know it all ."
10461,totally . they're responsible for calling the whole play in the huddle .
10462,"yes , they have a lot of pressure . ya know the nfl doesn't have a rule against female players ."
10463,"yeah , i love that . though it's a pretty sexist industry , given the rule the saints have with the cheerleaders ."
10464,"yeah , they can not be together or seen together . for instance if the players are somewhere that the cheerleaders are at then the cheerleaders must leave the location ."
10465,"that's offensive . it sounds like women are better off becoming engineers , as they make more money over a lifetime than a professional football player ."
10466,"wow , yeah the money part of the game is wild . i know that alex smith is one of the great qb's who is really smart and makes a lot of money ."
10467,"does he ? i would think since he got all the way to his master's degree before entering the draft , he would've lost out on some money . ya know , if he had just entered after high school ."
10468,"yeah , that is a really good point . i agree with you . he was the overall 2005 draft pick . baker mayfield was the overall pick from ou last year . we love the college ou team , too ."
10469,can you believe mayfield once considered quitting altogether to pursue a gaming career ?
10470,what ? that is crazy . i can't even imagine what his parents would have said to him . i guess college kids all like gaming .
10471,"right ? yeah , he says he can beat anyone at his college in halo 3 . not sure how you can make much of a career with that !"
10472,"yea , i agree with that statement ! lol . the university of iowa painted its visitors locker room pink , another type of game , i guess ."
10473,"just another example of the sexism in collegiate and professional football , i guess . can you believe bowlers in the 1960s made twice as much money as top football stars did ?"
10474,that is a shame for sure . not fair at all . salary was not fair for the toll it took on the players bodies . i don't think bowling was too hard on the bowlers in comparison .
10475,i'm not sure . it would be an interesting study . i know tennis players have a lot of wear and tear in their bodies from the repetitive motion . . . i wonder what happened to bowlers bodies over the course of 1520 years swinging a 10 pound bowl backandforth .
10476,"hmmm , good point . the nfl has put chips into the gear in order to track things like impact and force of the hits taken . so progress is being made ."
10477,"yeah , technology is crazy ."
10478,"hi , how are you ?"
10479,"pretty good , how are you ?"
10480,i am well . do you enjoy football ?
10481,i do was a little disappointed with the superbowl though .
10482,really ? why ? who were you rooting for ?
10483,well i was rooting for the rams but i would have liked to have seen a better game .
10484,that makes sense . who is your favorite team ?
10485,well if i had to pick between the redskins or bucks i would probably go with the skins . you ?
10486,i am from chicago so i love the bears . do you watch football a lot ?
10487,i never get the chance to as i am always busy . i heard that the only left handed quarterback is kellan moore .
10488,"that is true , although i find it hard to believe . so if not sports , what do you do in your spare time ?"
10489,don't really have any at the moment . did you know that there is a former patriot that has never fumbled the ball .
10490,that's crazy . or that the university of iowa's visitor's locker room is painted pink .
10491,i guess that's a psychological thing . every bit helps i guess .
10492,ga tech beat cumberland 2220 . i wonder if they have a pink locker room ?
10493,wow that game was bake in 1916 right ? espn won an award for the superimposed yellow line representing the first down .
10494,seems like a low bar to win an emmy . nfl games only have 11 minutes of action .
10495,now that was hard to believe . almost as hard as the fact that bowler in the 60's made more than nfl players .
10496,yeah . or that the nfl uses chips to track player movement .
10497,i think that's taking it way to far . kind of like new orleans cheerleaders having to leave a restaurant if a player comes in .
10498,nice chatting with you !
10499,is it true kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
10500,"i think so ! i always get him mixed up with kellylanne conway when i hear the name , though . do you think nfl is watched over there at the white house ?"
10501,kellyanne conway haha that's funny .
10502,oh jeez ! probably ! i guess the cowboys are one happy nfl team now after the amari cooper trade . have you heard about it ?
10503,i have not heard of that i've been netflix binging lately . i had no idea alex smith was such an educated guy .
10504,"well , it's not really big news . i guess the cowboys are happy because the redskins were leading but then they overtook them . i wonder if it was an epic football game ?"
10505,it would be nice to see the cowboys win a championship again . i like the history behind the huddle being to help a deaf quarterback .
10506,"yes , i remember learning about how the huddle started in school ! very smart ! i was reading that the cowboys have so much confidence lately in the nfl that they think their defense is unstoppable ."
10507,those are some big words thinking they are unstoppable . can you ever imagine a game score reaching anywhere near 2220 like the georgia tech v cumberland ?
10508,i can't imagine ! the losing team must have been very embarrassed . i don't think i've ever seen an nfl or any other sports game at all with a score even close to that . have you ?
10509,no that would be ridiculous . everyone in management would have to be replaced .
10510,"i think one of the most famous nfl quarterbacks is tom brady ? i remember something about a football family comprised of a dad and two sons that's super famous , too . i think it's the mannings ."
10511,oh yes the manning another great football name . those guys were awesome . i think one of the brothers still plays .
10512,"i remember now , one of the brothers is eli short for elisha manning . unique name . i think quite a few football players have unique names such as jake butt of the broncos ."
10513,yeah at least those were their given names and not something like chad ocho cinco because of his number .
10514,that's true ! i think amari cooper has had many injuries in his nfl career . i'm surprised the cowboys are so happy about that wide receiver ; the risk of re injury seems high in football games .
10515,yeah the sport has sped up a lot and coming back from an injury always puts you at a higher risk of it happening again .
10516,i think cooper came from the raiders to the cowboys ?
10517,yes i think thats how it worked out . so is there really chips inside players shoulder pads ?
10518,"i think so ! the nfl even has those chips in the actual footballs . i wish i could have thought of that idea ! who knows how advanced football with be in a few decades , right ?"
10519,no joke . can you imagine if helmets were still just made of leather . collissions could become lethal .
10520,"that would be terribly dangerous ! i think i've heard the nfl doing education courses as to how to still make contact but avoid injury . strategic , almost like martial arts . hope they teach young football players , too !"
10521,"hello , how are you today , do you have time to chat for a bit ?"
10522,did your nfl team start 02 this year ?
10523,unfortunately it has
10524,they have less than a 5 percent chance of making it to the playoffs then
10525,well it's good that i'm not a huge fan of nfl
10526,you must be watching the uninspiring broncos oakland game right now ?
10527,yes but just on in the background with the tv muted
10528,the seattle offfense have really been proving themselves the past couple weeks . don't you think ?
10529,"somewhat , they're doing somethings well and slacking on more of the basics ."
10530,j . j watt has a real chance at winning defensive player of the year again this year
10531,i agree and the bill's performance lately shows it .
10532,if you are busy watching the raiders and broncos game i can let you go
10533,yeah if you don't mind i can't keep my eye off the raiders strong defense and sacks
10534,russell wilson was sacked five times in yesterdays game
10535,i was watching and it was glorious
10536,seattle has the 2nd best offense in the league this year
10537,there runblocking is horrible though so i don't see them having much of a chance this year
10538,deshaun watson is having another mvp like year
10539,it appears his ankle is finally getting better i just hope it can hold up through the season
10540,he has help from jj watt if all else fails
10541,"true , i just wish the runblocking was on par with the rest"
10542,ny has a worse defense than buffalo or arizona
10543,"hello there , do you know who tommy mcdonald was ?"
10544,he was a terrific football player who helped my team the eagles to the nfl championship in '60 .
10545,"yeah that is right , good call ! well you certainly had a wild season last year !"
10546,"close on this year too ! i wish mcdonald would have been around to help , but he unfortunately died at the age of 84 . he was a hall of famer ."
10547,yeah i was sad to hear about him passing . i was glad he made it into the hall though .
10548,he started out as a twotime all american in oklahoma and played 12 seasons for the nfl making the pro bowl 6 times . he was quite a player for his small figure at 5 foot 7 inches .
10549,"yeah that is so cool , i love it when those tiny guys make it big . i was a big fan of muggsy bouges and earl boykins in the nba . are you a big football fan in general ?"
10550,"not particularly , but i like the super bowls . if women started playing , that would be fun to watch . the nfl has no rule against it . i would cheer them on ."
10551,yeah i think that is so cool and i definitely hope to see a women playing in the nfl sometime soon !
10552,i do like bowling though . are you a bowler ? in the 60's they made two times more than football players .
10553,"yeah i like to bowl and really ! ? that is so crazy to think about , i would like to see a graph that shows how they overlapped as time when by ."
10554,"perhaps if rb benjarvus greenellis were around then , the football players may have made more money with his impressive no fumbles in his nfl career ."
10555,"wow , i didn't know that , super impressive . i wonder how many total carries he had during his career ."
10556,i'm not sure but with only 11 minutes of live gameplay in the average game it still is impressive .
10557,"yeah i think i have read that before , you mean like not counting all the breaks right ? that seems like so little !"
10558,the balls and players are constantly tracked though . all this technology adds to the game an extra tactic not used back in tommy mcdonalds time . i bet no tracking chips were used then .
10559,yeah i don't think they had that kind of technology then . i know they use trackers in helmets for safety intelligence .
10560,"do you listen to games on the radio ? if you do , you can also hear jupiter's radio storms on the am stations ."
10561,"i do when i have to , i really like the local radio station we have here , they play lots of oldies . wow , that is a crazy fact ! jupiter is so far away !"
10562,sure is and it sounds like soldiers who also were probably far away from home made radios out of just a razorblade and pencil diode . that was very inventive .
10563,"that is an awesome fact , never knew that one as well . it was nice chatting with you , i hope you have a good night ."
10564,"hello , do you like football ?"
10565,"hello there , i do like football , did you watch the super bowl recently ?"
10566,i did actually . what i did not know was that there were only 11 minutes of game play
10567,yeah thats about the average actual gameplay during a regular game . there are lots of stops and reviews and all .
10568,yeah and all the ads . did you know women can play ?
10569,yeah i think that would be so cool if a female player made a pro roster in the near future .
10570,"yeah i hope that we see that at some point in the future , would make the game more fun"
10571,"it would , and it would give young girls something to motivate them to achieve all sorts of goals ."
10572,that is very true . did you hear about that rule that applies to new orleans cheerleaders ?
10573,"yeah i read about that , it seems a bit silly and outdated if you ask me ."
10574,i think it is really messed up and not sure how it is still around
10575,"yeah i agree , did you know about the average lifetime earnings ?"
10576,"yeah they make less then engineers , but then again their career is shorter"
10577,"that is what i figure it is , that the average career of a pro sports player is so much shorter ."
10578,yeah . did you know now they are using chips to track the players in the field ?
10579,"yeah i read about that , i think it helps them develop better safety features as well ."
10580,"yes that makes sense . how about the radio , do you listen to it ?"
10581,"yeah i do , i found a good local station that i really like . how about yourself ?"
10582,"yes me too . if you listen on the am , you might catch jupiter's storms"
10583,yeah isn't that so cool ! very interesting .
10584,"yeah for sure . nice chatting with you : ,"
10585,did you know that jupiter's storms are so strong that you cna pick them up on your am radio !
10586,"hello there , no that is so cool though ! are you a big fan of astronomy ?"
10587,"i know a little bit about it , what aobut you ?"
10588,"yeah i like it quite a bit , i'm a fan of the radio as well , i really enjoy my local stations ."
10589,ya did you know that you can make a radio out of a pencil and razorblade ? i guess they did that in wwii
10590,"that is such a cool fact . another interesting thing about the radio is that in canada , 40 percent of the music played over the radio has to be canadian ."
10591,"that is interesting , i don't know how good that sounds though , only a few canadian bands that i know and i can't say i like them that much haha"
10592,"yeah thats what i thought too , i bet a lot of people don't think thats a very good law lol ."
10593,"haha but it does sound better than the finnish radio station that does a weekly news program completely in latin , that sounds worse haha"
10594,holy cow that sounds awful . did you know there is a website where you can listen to old radio dramas for free ?
10595,"no i didn't know that , i would check that out i bet there's some gems on there , are you watching the superbowl later ?"
10596,yeah i think that is so cool . yeah i'm going to be watching who do you think will win ?
10597,"well i hope the patriots win personally , what is shocking is that the average game only has about 11 mins of live gameplay haha"
10598,i think they will win as well . and that is so crazy to think about . i do know you notice it much more when attending live games .
10599,"ya i haven't been to a live game in years , and i didn't know that women could technically play for the nfl which would be interesting"
10600,i think that would be so cool if we did get a female player in the league . i think that would be awesome for young girls around the world that are interested in sports .
10601,"ya i think it would add a new dimension , i hope the game later doesn't have a blowout score like the highest score in any football game ever , 2220 haha"
10602,"holy crap , i think i read about that before , wasn't it a college game ? they would have to score a touchdown on every play basically lol ."
10603,"haha ya when the score got to be 1000 i think i would just leave , cumberland must have felt horrible after that loss haha"
10604,"yeah , i wonder what the halftime talk by the coach was lol ."
10605,"haha ya like , all right guys we have no chance just go to sleep now haha"
10606,"hi , do you watch football ?"
10607,i watched parts of the last superbowl . i have a passing knowledge and passing interest in football so i am on and off
10608,nice . did you know university of iowa has oainted the visitor locker room pink
10609,do you know why ?
10610,"i have no idea , maybe discourage them in some way"
10611,"indeed , perhaps it is a mental thing to catch them off guard . so are you familiar with the nfl ?"
10612,yeah with some of it . i know football players used to make less than bowlers back in the day
10613,i couldn't believe that the average nfl game is only 11 minutes
10614,i know yet we are glue to the tv for hours on end
10615,i admit a lot and i mean a lot of action goes on in those few minutes . i mean the nfl is even putting chips in the ball and shoulder pads to get better data
10616,"yeah that must come in handy . espn won an award , an emmy"
10617,i admit their yellow line which they got an emmy for definitely made the game much more digestible for the audience
10618,seems that way . do you know what the highest score in history is ?
10619,i'm not sure but it must have been at least a difference of 150
10620,"it was 2220 , georgia tech beat the cumberlands"
10621,"i wonder if georgia tech was just that good , cumberlands was that bad , or perhaps a bit of both"
10622,i think it was a combination of both
10623,that does sound most plausible . georgia tech must have had talents like tom brady or green ellis
10624,not sure who played in their team but must have been boring to watch too
10625,"true . perhaps surprising until 50 pts , entertaining until 100 pts , and dull until 222 points"
10626,yeah i guess . nice chat
10627,good evening . are you a football fan ? did you know there is actually a new league starting tonight ?
10628,"no , i did not know that . i don't watch a lot of football , but i do know some intereesting bits of trivia about it . honestly , playing the game was more my brother's gig . he got a football scholarship in college . did you know for instance , the highest score ever in a football game was 2220 ? can you imagine been beat that badly ? yikes !"
10629,"i can't even imagine a score like that ! if you , or your brother , are curious , it's called the alliance of american football and it's actually connected to the nfl now ."
10630,"i did hear they were also trying to revive the xfl , that's the football league run by the wwe wrestling organization . never caught it the first time around , so i can't say if bringing it back is a good idea or not . . ."
10631,i think that is scheduled for 2020 so the spring will be interesting . did you happen to catch the super bowl ? it seems like it's one of the rare singleelimination finales in our us sports .
10632,"no i didn't see it , heard it wasn't the greatest though . they even griped about the group performing at half time , maroon 5 , although i understand they had a hard time even gettting anyone to perform . wonder if the commercials were any good this year though . . ."
10633,"it was a defensive struggle , maroon 5 was really just adam levine showing off , and the commercials were rather bland . it's crazy to think that in terms of actual gameplay , the halftime show was longer as an average nfl game just has about 11 minutes of live action ."
10634,"11 minutes ? it's hard to believe there's so little actual action in a game ! wonder if any of the teams played any tricks on each other , like how university of iowa has their visiting team's locker room painted pink ! hehe . . ."
10635,being from nebraska i know all about iowa's ploy to gain any psychological advantage !
10636,"yeah , it's kind of interesting . . . they've done studies and found color's really do effect people psychologically . read about an experiment where they painted a weight room pink and they found the lifters couldn't lift as much as they normally could . crazy , huh ?"
10637,yep ! another crazy thing to me is that bowlers used to make more than football players !
10638,"oh yeah , that was back when bowling was a huge thing they'd even have celebrity bowling tv shows and stuff . seems grossly unfair though , given how injury prone football players are ."
10639,"absolutely . especially when you factor in that despite all football players seem to make , an engineer makes more over a lifetime ."
10640,"neat little facto . . there's actually no rule against women being football players in the nfl . if they met the league's eligibility requirements , they could sign right up . not sure if that'll happen though . . ."
10641,"it does seem like a stretch due to the physical differences . it is interesting that apparently a woman can play for the nfl , but a saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if a saints player comes in ."
10642,"oh , wow , guess they're serious about the two not fraternizing ."
10643,they must be ! i wonder which group it protects ? they definitely invest in their players . did you know they have made chips to track about every movement on the field a player makes ?
10644,"yeah , i heard about that . . . they've got a chip in the ball as well . . . probably makes it easier to go statistics and whatnot . especially since it can keep track of velocity , rotation and speed ."
10645,amazing how far it's come . i bet there was a time just getting a radio broadcast of the game was huge !
10646,i remember back when all they had was madden using the white ' chalk ' lines and now they've got all these cool graphics and stuff to help everyone keep track of what's going on . . . it's pretty amazing .
10647,thanks for the chat ! it's time for some football !
10648,"hey , you too ! have a great evening !"
10649,you too !
10650,hello how are you doing today ?
10651,i am good . just missing football season . i can't wait for the 32 teams to get back out on the field in the fall !
10652,i love football too . who is your team ?
10653,i am from florida so i root for the dolphins even though they are terrible ! the dolphins lose most of their 16 games a season . how about you ?
10654,haha i'm from ohio so i root for the cincinnati bengals .
10655,hard to believe nfl football has been played since 1932 . the field was 80 yards back then .
10656,that's crazy . there's no written rule against female players in the nfl .
10657,i would like to see some female players . i bet they would be very strategic .
10658,it would be interesting . an average nfl game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
10659,have you ever seen snoop dogg's son play ? he's pretty good ! snoop wrote a song for the high school team his son was on .
10660,"i heard he's really good , but have never seen him play ."
10661,i enjoy listening to games on the radio . the use of air waves and electromagnetic energy waves is a great way to consume football .
10662,i love listening games on the radio as well . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than an average nfl and mlb player .
10663,engineers are the creators of the tracking chips the nfl uses to measure player moves on the field .
10664,that's a cool technology . maybe it can help out with concussions and other injuries through data .
10665,that would be amazing ! a brilliant engineer that now coaches in the nfl is named matt patricia .
10666,that's cool . the highest ever football score was 2220 .
10667,humiliating score for the losing team ! they probably did not make it to the super bowl on the first sunday in february .
10668,former patriots greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career
10669,"that is impressive ! he deserves a nice stadium like the allen , texas one that cost 60 million ."
10670,it was great talking to you !
10671,"hi , how are you doing tonight ?"
10672,great . are you in one of the 32 nfl cities ?
10673,"at the moment , no . but i grew up near some . how about you ?"
10674,"i am in phoenix , one of the 16 nfc cities . unfortunately , we have the number one draft choice which means the worst record ."
10675,"well , it's a rebuilding year . happens to many teams . who do you think you'll get ?"
10676,i would hope kyler murray but the defensive guy from ohio state is most likely . the season is 17 weeks even though each team only plays 16 games .
10677,does anyone care about the sexual preferences of the players in the nfl these days ?
10678,"i have heard a little rumbling , but i thought it was about gender rather than homosexuality . what have you heard ?"
10679,haven't heard . i know that there is no rule against women . what's the story ?
10680,i think that some teams just worry about pr challenges . it takes a team chemistry to win . i expect to see a woman kicker someday . no rule against women in the nfl .
10681,"yeah , a woman kicker makes sense . could come over from soccer ."
10682,"great point . imagine the income that players get from only 11 minutes of action in each game . if you play defense or offense , that is 5 . 5 minutes for you ."
10683,that's a pretty good perminute salary . it's quite different from basketball and soccer .
10684,"true . i started my career as an engineer and made about 4 million so far . my neighbor was a running back for the cardinals and he made 7 million in his last season . but on average , engineers make more than nfl players over a career ."
10685,maybe your neighbor could become an engineer later in life after he retires from football . the earnings of an engineer are good . women should go into that instead of football .
10686,"there is a push for women in stem . he coaches running backs for another nfl team now , so he is doing okay . brand new porche in his driveway this week . in new orleans , the cheerleaders cannot dine in the same restaurant as a player . the cheerleader has to leave if a player comes in ."
10687,"i think that's an outdated sexist system . parents , don't let your daughters grow up to be cheerleaders ! teach 'em engineering !"
10688,"those nfl salaries took a while to grow . in the 1960's , top bowlers earned more than nfl players ."
10689,"top bowlers were lucky that the professional leagues didn't have their act together . college ball was big , and tv hadn't grown enough ."
10690,"you are right . also , the nfl has to pay a lot more players than the 10 or 12 top bowlers . that espn yellow line that marks the line to gain for a first down has been a nice improvement for tv watchers ."
10691,"it has been an improvement , but does it deserve an award ?"
10692,nice chat !
10693,"i did not know that jupiter had radio systems . now , i know that earth is not the only planet with radios ."
10694,i didn't know that jupiter had radio system either . do you think that life on jupiter ?
10695,"well , i am imagining it right now , but on jupiter it would be dark cuz the sun is so far away ."
10696,"yes , that's what i learn i wonder for years did man actually visit these planets . if they did man may had place items on these planets ."
10697,"well , maybe nasa had a certain technique and system to bring astronauts to space ."
10698,yes i pretty sure they do . have you ever heard of sun's music ? i have any idea what is sun's music .
10699,i bet that is a lot of money for nasa to use in making machines and satellites over there . no i have not .
10700,"that's true , i wonder why dc resident called the nfl eagles the america's team ."
10701,that is interesting . i don't recall . i think they won the super bowl last year against the patriots .
10702,what did you think about sunday's super bowl games ? do you think the entire game was exciting ?
10703,"i think it was excited when they were tied 33 . once i saw 4th quarter , i already knew it was a win for the patriots . i like the halftime show ."
10704,"yes , i like the halftime show and commercials . i agree i knew who will win also rams is a rather young team ."
10705,i am so happy that adam levine had some special guests . rams can win another year . they should feel lucky to actually be in the super bowl .
10706,"yes they should , but they came from such a long ways to lose against a team that already won five super bowl championships ."
10707,this gives them more time to practice and develop strength and ability . it's never too late . when was the last time they won a super bowl game ?
10708,"i am not sure the exact year , but i think the rams lost also . they play several games against new england and lost ."
10709,"wow , against the patriots . once the rams know the patriots are against them , they either know that they will lose or they will have a chance to win ."
10710,"true , what team is your favorite team , or you don't have a favorite team ? pittsburgh is my favorite team ."
10711,i think i mentioned earlier that the 49ers are my favorite team .
10712,"no , according to my knowledge this is the first time that question by me . i like them ."
10713,"all right , i will go now ."
10714,hey ! do you like football at all . . . .
10715,love it and sad it is over for the year . it seems like the season goes so fast . you know the season is only 17 weeks with one bye week . not enough football for me .
10716,right ! i love football but rarely get to follow it . i sometimes listen to the games on the radio lol . . . always busy . . . .
10717,did you know that jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio . i wonder what that sounds like !
10718,"really ? i really need to try and tune in so i can hear that , an a . m radio station huh ? i will check it out ! there is a website that plays old classic radio dramas for free ."
10719,i love some talk radio so that channel may be fun to listen to ! in canada the music on their radios have to be at least 40 percent must be canadian .
10720,"wow , i bet so the canadians can get good radio air time . i get that . i was listening to a talk radio show and they were saying an nfl game on average only has a mere 11 minutes of actual live play . . . . that's crazy !"
10721,i know . . . you think that football players get paid the big bucks but i heard in the long run you are better off being an engineer . they tend to have higher than average lifetime earnings of both a nfl and mlb player !
10722,"no way ! i never would have thought that at all . . . . very interesting . i like the fact that the nfl has no written rules against women playing football , as long as they meet their requirements ."
10723,better than being a cheerleader . . . the new orleans saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player and they even have to leave if one comes in to eat . talk about double standards !
10724,"that is just wrong , i wonder if that is true to this day or something of the past . . . . just like the locker room being painted all pink in the university of iowa's locker room for the visiting team lol"
10725,that is sure to annoy the visiting team ! did you know that in the 60s top bowlers made more money than football stars . crazy ! doesn't sound right !
10726,"that is truly crazy ! i bet that is not the case in present times lol . i wonder if they still use the tracking chips put into players pads to record their every move . . . . and inside footballs to track velocity and rotation , speed very interesting !"
10727,thank goodness no one is tracking how slow i am ! you know the game football means different sports to different people . like soccer in some countries is called football in others . so confusing !
10728,"haha , me too ! that is interesting and makes sense ! i wonder if they tracked the game that was won 2220 back in 1916 . . . . that is awesome , what a score !"
10729,wow ! i feel sorry for the team that lost . wasn't it cumberland ?
10730,"yes ! it was actually . they played against georgia tech . pretty amazing , just like how former patriots rb never fumbled a ball ever , in his nfl career !"
10731,patriots are an amazing team . . . love or hate them they have the talent . did you watch the super bowl this year ? it is usually held the first sunday of february .
10732,"i didn't get to see the superbowl this year , but i heard it was an awesome game . the patriots are definitely a great team . would have loved to have seen the game !"
10733,me too ! well maybe next year with the season starts in september you can make it to a game .
10734,right ? i will definitely make it to a football game this year .
10735,i hope so ! it was nice talking to you . have a good day !
10736,it has been great ! you have a great day too !
10737,do you like football ?
10738,yes i do . u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
10739,i wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on the players
10740,i wonder too . bowlers make more money than them though in the 60s
10741,i guess football was not that popular back in the day either though
10742,true . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
10743,yes that is georgia tech beating cumberland 2220
10744,yeah and that was way back in 1916 and is still a record
10745,yeah . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
10746,yes that was for the superimposed yellow line
10747,yeah . did you know banjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball ?
10748,"wow , what a guy . do you listen to the radio ?"
10749,yes i do . you can listen to jupiter's storms in am radio
10750,nice . do you ever listen to canadian radios ?
10751,yes sometimes but they play a lot of music from canadian artists
10752,"yes they are required to do that by law , 40 percent of it has to be canadian"
10753,true . do you now how soldiers made foxhole radios during wwii ?
10754,yes they used pencils and razorblades to make those
10755,yes . do you listen to radio dramas ?
10756,yes there is a free website where you can listen to them too
10757,yes that is so convenient . nice chatting with you .
10758,"hello , do you watch a lot of football ?"
10759,i do sometimes . how about you ?
10760,"actually , i don't . only for big games like the super bowl etc . did you know the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ? ?"
10761,i know isn't that crazy as long as a game lasts . did you know in the 60's bowlers made twice as much as the top football players .
10762,now that is pretty awesome . i like bowling . think it takes as much skill as football . i didn't realize girls could play in the nfl if they met the eligibility requirements .
10763,i think guys would give them a hard time but it's cool . and if they are on the university of iowa visiting team they get a pink locker room
10764,"that would be great . can't say i like the rules about the mo saints' cheerleaders . apparently they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player already in the restaurant . plus if a player comes in after , the cheerleaders have to leave . unbelievable !"
10765,i think that is crazy . if they are at away game what are the chances of them running into a player at a restaurant . i wonder if they enforce it .
10766,i wonder why it is a rule . something must have happened to cause them to come up with that one !
10767,that is true . and i think it is interesting that nfl uses tracking chips in their players shoulder pads
10768,"all in all , i think football is pretty scientific with all the plays and strategies they come up with . those chips track all their moves and helps the coaches design their moves . pretty genius ."
10769,true . can you believe there was a game of a score of 2220 . how is that even possible .
10770,either ga tech was really good or cumberland was really bad . how about patriots' running back benjarvus who never fumbled the ball in his entire career ?
10771,that is a great accomplishment . did you know espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line .
10772,that is pretty cool . i need all the tv explanations that go on during the games . otherwise i would be so lost sometimes . espn is the channel we watch for all sports .
10773,i like espn for some things . i got espn 2 for ufc events and it has not been a good experience .
10774,"that's too bad . did you hear that the cardinals' adrian peterson is buying his linemen mattresses because they did so well in the last game . i guess they were pretty horrible before . he wants to make sure they sleep well . : ,"
10775,that is nice of him to do . nfl players make a lot of money but it's interesting that engineers make more money than nfl players
10776,"they use a lot of brain power ! btw , i meant to say the redskins not cardinals . : ,"
10777,do you like to listen to the radio ?
10778,yes i do . i have a long commute to work so the radio keeps me sane ! hey nice chatting . have a great rest of the day !
10779,hi how are you ? do you like radio ?
10780,"still like to listen , but fav . local station switched to ' talk ' radio , no music , sev . yrs . ago . do you have a fav . radio show ?"
10781,i dont but i try to catch up on the news . i used to listen to a lot of music on the radio when i was younger .
10782,do you listen to podcasts today ? any particular sports broadcasts you follow ?
10783,i dont listen to sports stuff . i usually try to listen to news . do you listen to sports podcasts ?
10784,"not regularly . occasionally learn something interesting , though : did you know redskins rb , adrian peterson stated recently that he's buying king mattresses for his offensive line because ' . . . having these guys up front creates holes ' for peterson to run through . that was fun to listen to ."
10785,lol . that is great ! maybe i should take a listen to some of this stuff . it sounds great !
10786,peterson was quoted on pro football talk podcast . do you have a fav . pro team ?
10787,"at the moment , no . i used to follow the 49ers ."
10788,"san francisco ! that is , if that city still hosts that team . . . they keep switching ! did you see feb . super bowl ?"
10789,"yeah , they moved the stadium to another city . i did not . i usually try to watch . did not have a chance this time . did you watch ?"
10790,"yes , sigh , . brady and the patriots got 6th win . a bit tired of that franchise , though tom brady is a legendary qb . beat the la rams . you didn't miss much . hs football is more fun , i think . do you follow or see local teams ?"
10791,"i dont . i am concerned that the sport can cause a lot of problems . the concussions could be a problem for hs players . i like the game , but player safety is key ."
10792,"well said , and because of fan's valid concerns , game is changing . but my dad , who coached hs football for 41 yrs . , used to say is biggest concern was boys who would not report injuries to him . . . less of an issue today , do you think ?"
10793,i dont know . the problem is that injuries are expected but kids want to play . i did not play football because of my concern about injuries . i figured other sports were safer .
10794,you figured right . do you suppose soccer is safer ? sure is popular worldwide . . .
10795,"soccer is safer , but the guys are wimps . they fake fouls . the women are tougher ."
10796,"i see . college football is huge in my region . did you know that 14 of the world's 25 biggest stadiums are college stadiums like our beaver stadium , penn state , ."
10797,"i figure that the stadiums have become places of worship . i enjoy sports , but they should not overshadow the mission of the university . anyway , great chat !"
10798,agree . very well said . cheers !
10799,have a good day !
10800,thanks .
10801,hi how are you ? do you listen to the radio ?
10802,yeah . i love listening to the radio .
10803,i dont listen to it much now . i used to listen a lot as a kid .
10804,i listened to it more when i was a kid for sure . thats all we used to have . lol . i sound old .
10805,"i used to listen for music , then for news . now i go to youtube ."
10806,you tube is awesome . did you know that bill murray used to voice the fantastic four radio show .
10807,"i did nto know that . that must have been a long time ago , before his film career ."
10808,yeah it was . in 1948 bing crosby records filled more than half of the radio time for recorded music . he was pretty popular .
10809,he was the voice of radio . then sinatra came along . he probably got a lot of radio play too .
10810,i would say so . you still him every once in awhile now a days . old blue eyes . isnt that hat they called him .
10811,"yes , he was quite slender in the old days . they said you had to tie a knot in his arm to give him an elbow ."
10812,i did not know that about him . imagine a ventriloquist being the most popular act on a radio show .
10813,"yes , people really can seem simple sometimes . but i bet the lines were funny ."
10814,they most have been . i bet a lot of kids listened to it . i can picture all the kids gathering around a radio every sunday for the new show .
10815,"yeah , there probably was not much else to do for entertainment . watch the grass grow ?"
10816,they could play with there ball hooked to a paddle . lol .
10817,"yeah , that silly old game . or hoolahoops ! yeah !"
10818,so are you a football fan ?
10819,i sometimes watch . i guess the super bowl is good . i didnt watch it this year . you ?
10820,i didnt watch it either . did you know that snoop dog wrote the fight song to his sons ootball team .
10821,"snoop ! probably keep it g rated . anyway , great chat !"
10822,lol . have a great day .
10823,"hi , do you watch football ?"
10824,"not very much . i did watch my saints in the playoffs ; the final playoff game was painful . but , i do have season tickets to lsu football !"
10825,nice . did you know women can play too ?
10826,"i figured as much , considering we had a woman ref in the nfl playoffs . i just don't know when they will break thru that glass ceiling . what i find interesting is the use of tech in football , like tracking chips to record hit ' g ' forces ."
10827,yea that is nice . and they can track so many more statistics with those chips
10828,"football , and other sports , have odd traditions and superstitions . did you know saint's cheerleaders cannot be in the same restaurant with any nfl player ?"
10829,i find that very sexist . the worst is that they have to leave even midmeal
10830,"i agree . it seems like what is off field should remain off field . it caries over to college football as well . the university of iowa painted the visiting football teams locker pink . i do not know if it was in humor , intimidation , or a bit of both ?"
10831,i think pink is a color that causes distraction so maybe it was to help their own team
10832,"probably a carryover in machoism . but , you can say technology has really changed the game . we have tracking chips in the uniforms and the ball and 2way radio in the qbs helmet . it sure has changed a lot from the days of hand signals between the qb and the coach on the sideline !"
10833,for sure . did you now bowlers used to make more than football players back in the day ?
10834,"i did not know that . we often here about the mega contracts the star players get but not the contracts of the average and 2nd string players . i recently learned that because of the short career in pro football , the average lifetime earnings of a typical nfl player is less than the lifetime earnings and an engineer . unfortunately , too many football players don't invest well for their after football days ."
10835,i guess not . i mean they still get paid more nowadays but a lot of them take on secondary jobs to make ends meet
10836,true . there are just not that many positions in sports tv and radio for retired nfl players . espn has a good suite of nfl retires and has made tech work for them . did you know espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow line to show the first down location for their viewers ?
10837,yeah that is quite the achievement for them to win an award for that
10838,i grew up in a very rural area where tv reception was poor ; so we listened to the games on the am radio . do you still listen to live radio or have you migrated over to internet streaming and podcasts ?
10839,yeah i do from time to time . curious to know if i can catch jupiter's storms in there
10840,"that would be interesting . i wonder if astronomers can predict or time them so that we can know when and how to tune it . its interesting that in canada , in an effort to preserve local culture , all radio stations are required by law to play 40 percent canadian music . i hope they have many other performers and not justin bieber , lol , !"
10841,haha one would hope because just justin would be boring . but good for them for supporting canadian talent
10842,"true . we do the same thing down in louisiana . not by law but in the interest of retaining our cajun , creole , and zydeco musical heritage . with respect to heritage and history , did you know that a finnish radio station as a entire weekly news program in classical latin . i wonder how many listeners follow and understand the centuries old dead language ?"
10843,i really wonder about that too but if they are still in business that must mean they have plenty of listeners
10844,true . well its about time to go . the dogs are starting to go off when they want their supper . they are pretty good at nerf football with respect to recovering fumbles . if i could just get them to stay inbounds !
10845,well have a good one . nice chat
10846,do you watch or play football ?
10847,yes i do . my favorite team is the eagles . did you know that in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as football stars ?
10848,really ? it's amazing how much popularity football has gained since then . now we even have a superimposed yellow line that espn won an emmy for .
10849,i didn't know about the superimposed yellow line . did you know that the highest score ever in a football game was 2220 ?
10850,"wow , i wonder what happened ! i'm not really into football as there are only 11 minutes live gameplay on average in a game but that seems like it would have been an interesting game to watch ."
10851,yes it does . the nfl has no written rule against female players . i find that interesting .
10852,i hope a woman will be able to meet the eligibility requirements one day !
10853,so do i . do you listen to the radio ?
10854,not that much . did you know that you can hear jupiter's storms on the am radio ?
10855,no i did not
10856,there is also a finnish radio station that broadcasts a weekly program in classical latin . i wonder how many people can understand it !
10857,"that is very cool . in canada , all radios are required to have at least 40 percent of the music to be played to be candian ."
10858,"i haven't heard that much canadian music , i didn't know there was that much . would you listen to a website with thousands of classic radio dramas ?"
10859,"i know avril lavigne came from canada and her music was played there . no i would not listen to a website with classic radio dramas . it is free , which is neat ."
10860,i'd love to learn how to make a foxhole radio
10861,how do you do that ? i have never heard of a foxhole radio . since 1989 a finnish radio station has broadcasted a weekly news program conducted in classical latin .
10862,i am not sure but soldiers in wwii used to make them with a razorblade and pencil .
10863,that is cool . do you know that new orleans saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat in the same resturant as an nfl player ?
10864,"yeah , and not only that , but i heard that if the cheerleaders are already eating there and the players come in , , that the cheerleaders have to leave ."
10865,i find that ridiculous . cheerleaders have very low wages to begin with which is unfair . thanks for chatting with me !
10866,"yeah , i wonder how they can get away with that . nice chatting with you ."
10867,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
10868,hello ! yes big fan here ! how about you ?
10869,i love the nfl as well . did you know they have no written rule against females playing ?
10870,i would like to see a girl play . be nice . the university of iowa painted their visitors locker rooms pink . must have been to mess with the other team .
10871,that would be cool . i wonder if the pink locker room actually affected the team at all ?
10872,i doubt it . lol in the 1960's someone would have been better off to be a top bowler rather than a top football star of the day because bowlers made twice as much money as the footballers did .
10873,wow that's pretty amazing . i would have never guessed that . i bet bowlers don't make a whole lot these days .
10874,"i bet nowhere near as much as the players . however , the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are more than the earnings of an average football player ."
10875,that's interesting . i guess because nfl careers are usually pretty short .
10876,that would be my guess . do you know what the highest score ever was for a college football game ?
10877,i saw it was 2220 . that is just insane !
10878,talk about a blowout ! i was surprised to find out that there is actually only 11 minutes of live gameplay per an average nfl game . i thought it would have been a little more than that .
10879,i can't believe it's only 11 minutes of gameplay . i would have never guessed that . must be all of the huddles and play calling .
10880,yes and tv timeouts . lol how about rb benjarvus greenellis . the former patriots running back never fumbled the ball once in his nfl career .
10881,that's pretty amazing to never fumble your entire career .
10882,i know . i wonder how many carries he had ? did you know that espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line you see while watching games ?
10883,i have no idea . do you listen to the radio ?
10884,i love listening to the radio ! how about you ?
10885,i do too . especially in my commute into work . did you know jupiter has radio storms so strong they can be heard on earth ?
10886,same here . i actually listen to a lot of sports talk radio . i didn't know that about jupiter . how cool is that ?
10887,it was good talking to you !
10888,"hey there , do you listen to the radio ?"
10889,"actually , no , i don't listen very often anymore . i think i got turned off by all the advertisements . still , the way it works is fascinating in how it's transformed in its original form"
10890,yeah for sure . you can even catch jupiter's storm in the am .
10891,i guess it's a large planet that can still reach us here on earth . there are websites now that let you listen to classic radio dramas .
10892,that is so nice and it is free . do you know much latin ?
10893,"most consider it a dead language , but apparently in finland , some still know it enough for there to be a news program in classical latin"
10894,i really wonder how many listeners they have considering latin is a dead language .
10895,"i know a school that still teaches it , so maybe not as dead as we are told . in canada , at least 40 percent of the music you'll hear is canadian since it's a law there"
10896,that is one way to support local and national artists . in the earlier times soldiers used to make radios using razorblades and pencils
10897,"i wonder what kind of information they could pick up . the radio definitely isn't as popular as it used to be . back in the day , people would use it to listen to sports events like that of the mlb and nfl"
10898,"yeah , i would like to know that too . do you watch football now on tv ?"
10899,i typically only watch a handful of playoff games and the super bowl . what's cool is how they use embedded chips in the shoulder pads and footballs to track speed and all that . it makes sense
10900,"yeah they might be able to use that info for so many things . at the end of it , in a game of nfl the game time is only 11 minutes ."
10901,"which isn't very long when you think about it . some people make a big deal about how much money they make , but the average engineer will earn more in a lifetime"
10902,"yeah , i heard a player teaches in the off season to makes ends meet ."
10903,"wow . i guess the season only lasts 17 weeks of games . apart from training , they have a lot of time off"
10904,and sometimes they have strange rules . new orleans cheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant as the nfl players .
10905,"maybe the wives requested that one . usually the rules exist due to prior problems . there's no rule against women playing , but i'm not sure if any have tried"
10906,"yeah i wonder about that . at least f they want , they can try for it"
10907,sounds like a risk of injury . the playoffs in the nfl are much quicker than that of the mlb since it's single elimination
10908,that is true . it was nice chatting with you .
10909,do you like football ?
10910,i do . snoop dog once wrote a song for his son's team
10911,nice . u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
10912,i wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on them
10913,me too . bowlers made more than football players in the 60s
10914,wow . coaches of football are really well paid nowadays though
10915,yeah true . do you know the highest score in college football ?
10916,"i have no idea , have not heard of that"
10917,it is 2220 when cumberland lost to georgia tech in 1916
10918,wow what a score . a stadium in texas can sit 18 000 people
10919,"wow that is huge , how much did that cost ?"
10920,it was about 60 million and it is for a high school
10921,wow . did you know women can play in the nfl ?
10922,did not know that but heard they are using tracking chips on the players now
10923,yes if they meet the requirements they can play . they are ?
10924,yes they are tracking velocity and speed and such
10925,nice i wonder if they can use that to make the game safer
10926,good point . did you know matt patricia used to be a rocket scientist ?
10927,wow that is such a huge career jump
10928,indeed it is . nice chat today
10929,same here
10930,"i wonder if the athletes wouldn't have already had their own king sized mattressess before being gifted them , haha ."
10931,can you ever really have too many though ?
10932,then again i guess maybe the coach is wealthy enough to afford fancier mattresses since his team is performing so well .
10933,"this is true . we might find out on the next ' redskins talk ' podcast . good dudes , free beer and king size mattresses for days ."
10934,is that a podcast operated by players on the team ?
10935,it sure is . it's on siriusxm nfl radio . it's where we can hear about adrian peterson's 96 yards against the cards on sunday .
10936,"oh , that's interesting , i typically like listening to radio dramas myself which is lucky for me because there are websites where you can listen to tons of episodes of them for free ."
10937,"you make a good point . i didn't know until today that bill murray was the voice of the human torch on the fantastic four radio show . aw jeeze , ain't radio great ."
10938,"i didn't know that either . radio is great , and also so mysterious ! i never realized that planets like jupiter have strong radio storms happening on them that you can actually listen to through an am radio ."
10939,that's actually pretty cool . seriously . i think they should put more nfl games on the radio . it would be a good chance to listen to the patriots getting crushed on .
10940,the fact that you can even make your own radio using simple items like razor blades and pencils would also make that a dream situation for a football fan who is handy with electronics !
10941,that would be pretty great . i would build my own radio just to listen to that song that snoop dogg wrote for his son's high school football team
10942,"wow , i never heard about that ! that sounds like a lot more fun than just having your locker room painted pink like the university of iowa had"
10943,"at least it's . . . . okay , okay , pink is pretty bad , but the high school stadium in allen , texas cost 60 mil . that would buy a lot of pink paint ."
10944,it's amazing that for how much they put into the locker rooms football players make much less than say engineers for example !
10945,"ha ! that's true . but coaches make bank . the army , navy and air force football coaches are the highest paid people in the department of defense ."
10946,well that's good for them ! even the people at espn who design graphics like the yellow first down line have won emmys so they probably are paid a lot too
10947,"that's a good point . it's too bad ' redskins talk ' podcast can't win an emmy . ah well , at least they gave one to rick and morty ."
10948,i guess for football players it's the superbowl that feels like their own emmy
10949,this is true . hopefully it will be the redskins turn at the big game this year .
10950,i guess we'll see after the regular season is done and they all play in the playoffs !
10951,do you watch football ?
10952,from time to time . how about you ?
10953,"i used to watch it a lot more , but apparently the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of gameplay ."
10954,"come to think about it , that is so strange , there is so much in between . and the game has advanced so much . now the players carry chips in their paddings"
10955,"yeah , when i watch it , it seems like i'm just watching people stand around all day ."
10956,so much down time . there is an astronaut turned coach that serves in one of the teams
10957,"interesting , i wonder what he studied in school ."
10958,rpi . have you heard about the curiosity sorrounding that school ?
10959,no i haven't . what is that about ?
10960,"they have fight song that includes a sin , cosine and a tangent and six digits of pi"
10961,interesting . did you know that jupiter storms can be heard on the radio ?
10962,yeah on the am . maybe i should switch from time to time to see if i can catch it
10963,"me too , but i'm not sure what station ."
10964,me either . there was a song by hanson that became the most played in a chicage radio because the djs would not reveal the band
10965,i wonder if he is canadian ?
10966,i am not sure actually . in 1948 bing crosby filled something like more than half of the radio time allocated to recorded music
10967,"i like bing crosby , do you listen to him much ?"
10968,not really . have you heard of bill murray ?
10969,"yeah , he's a great actor . i really like his movies ."
10970,he was the voice of human torch in fantastic four in 1930s in radio
10971,interesting . i saw him in groundhog day .
10972,"the nfl is a professional american football league consisting of 32 teams , divided equally between the nfc and afc"
10973,"hi , how are you ? are you a football fan ? do you follow the nfl ? which of the 32 teams do you like ?"
10974,chicago is my favourite team . what about you
10975,"i usually root for the underdog in the superbowl . : , did you know that there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay in an nfl game ? that's a great salary on a perminute basis ."
10976,"new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player , the cheerleader are required to leave ."
10977,i guess that to prevent relationships between players and cheerleaders . they must have had problems in the past .
10978,"the players want to focus on the game , i think is the good rules ."
10979,"true . speaking of women , i wonder when women will play in the nfl . there's no rule against it ."
10980,"now , radio is hear by only few peoples . you listen to radio ?"
10981,"i used to listen to the radio when i was a kid . now i use the internet , which is much more convenient ."
10982,jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio .
10983,i don't know that i would want to listen . probalby not as good as top 40 .
10984,do you play football ?
10985,"not really a football player . heard that back in the 60s , top bowlers made more than pro football players . things certainly have changed ."
10986,there different variations of football are known as football codes .
10987,i don't know the rules for the other forms of football . seems to be a universal sport . i wonder if any of those teams paints their visiting team's locker room pink .
10988,its the most lovable sports by many people . its has so much fans .
10989,are you going to watch the super bowl this weekend ? which of the teams is your favorite ?
10990,"yes , yellow line representing the first down line for american football games ."
10991,espn won an award for that feature in the televised games ! it makes it easier for viewers to understand the game .
10992,there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free .
10993,i wonder what generation listens to those programs . youngsters don't want to hear those shows .
10994,hearing and thinking are the most two important event in brain . it makes brain activity .
10995,"well , it's been fun chatting !"
10996,"yes , have a great day ."
10997,bye !
10998,hi how are you ?
10999,"good , how about you ? are you a football fan ?"
11000,"if there is money in it , i am . i like to watch the game for gambling . you ?"
11001,"i play fantasy , which is partially gambling , and i bet on the super bowl . who would have bet the highest score for a football game was georgia tech defeating cumberland 2220 ?"
11002,"that was a blow out . i figure that gt had something to prove to cumberland . i dont know what , but they proved it ."
11003,"lots of fumbles , interceptions , etc ."
11004,that must have been a lot of fun for the teams . good experience . a learning experience for everyone involved . i envy them
11005,"probably sad for cumberland lol , but yea they can learn from it"
11006,they can learn that football is not their sport .
11007,"lol yes , i didnt realize the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual gameplay"
11008,the players union has ensured that work time is minimal . the fans are steamed about it but what can they do ? put in other players ?
11009,"i dunno , to be honest , i dont know that players would take much more than 11 minutes of high speed contact ."
11010,"with the chips in their pads , we can monitor them until it is too much , then put in other players . technology allows us to maximize gameplay ."
11011,yup . also makes for good explanations on tv
11012,"yes , i figure that the fans deserve to know the exact time and place that each concussion happens . they paid a lot of money so the data should be there ."
11013,"for medical reasons , too . and to show the speed of athletes ."
11014,i guess the athletes are in danger on the field . they should be protected . i think that genetic engineering is a good way to build stronger players . the nfl should start an engineering firm to build the better player .
11015,be ready for the first sub 4 . 0 40 yard dash
11016,"that is just a matter of time and engineering . i know that we will have the first supersprinter in the world . anyway , great chat ! keep on running !"
11017,imagine a 250 pound guy running 4 second 40 . kinda scary .
11018,i imagine a 500 pound guy running that speed . the possibilities are endless . the fans will be in awe . have a good day !
11019,you too !
11020,"good morning ! ! sweet . . . . football , nfl , and radio . . . i'm good to talk about any of them . . . your choice on this blustery winter day !"
11021,it is really getting cold here ! what a great conversation starter ! you like football ?
11022,"i love football here in cleveland ohio ! but , i wish the saints would've made it in ."
11023,hi ! i'm in se ohio . i do too . do you follow the eagles at all ?
11024,i know about the eagles . my brother doesn't live too far from there . . . he's in lancaster . i don't know about that qb carson wentz though . . . guy can't stay healthy .
11025,thats true . always getting hurt . i'm more appalachia then columbus . could you imagine a football score of 220 now ? that would be impossible !
11026,lol . . . . not playing against the browns it wouldn't for the last 20 years . that's an awful lot of football scoring ! what city you live in ?
11027,i remember how big lebron james was when he came home to cleveland . we thought he was going to make cleveland big . around cambridge .
11028,"oh , heck . my brother used to live in coshocton . . . you're not far from me at all . yes , lebron was huge ! and we were big for a year at least . not really caring for the national football league and their refs this year . . . i feel like the super bowl was rigged in the teams they got ."
11029,i agree . seems really strange . do you remember when they started using those yellow lines on the tv for football ? espn won an emmy for that !
11030,no kidding ? i never knew it won an emmy . it makes it easier seeing the first down though .
11031,it does . i have family cuyahoga falls . green ellis has neve fumbled a ball !
11032,i think you just jinxed him . . . lol . cuyahoga falls isn't a bad town . i'm thinking on moving there . and i might listen to the super bowl on the radio if i can't get my tv to work .
11033,"that a good idea . there is a lot of train traffic though , so you may have to turn the radio or tv up a bit ! would you watch a female nfl league ?"
11034,"perhaps ? football i think is rough for anyone to be playing . though , i've known some women in my life that could definitely play ."
11035,": , an nfl game only has 11 minutes of live play . i think women could do it ."
11036,"yes , i've heard about that only 11 minutes of gameplay thing . odd . . . it usually takes me a 6pack of beer to watch all 11 minutes of live football !"
11037,i figure it takes that for a lot of people ! do you think your radio will work in cuyahoga falls ? radio waves will have to go thru a lot of metal around there .
11038,i didn't realize cuyahoga falls had that bad of a problem . my radio would probably pick up cleveland stations . hey ! i'm glad we had this talk ! have a really great day !
11039,you too ! it's been a pleasure !
11040,"welp , back to the frigid weather . the radio said it's going down to 4 tomorrow"
11041,i know it . i'm already dressed in layers for today !
11042,good evening ! planning to watch any football this weekend ?
11043,"hello , unfortunately i dont watch football , but there are some interesting facts here . snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team ."
11044,i didn't know that . i bet the song was probably half as long as the live gameplay in an nfl game . for a four hour game there are like 11 minutes of actual gameplay !
11045,"yeah thats ridiculous ha . the high school football stadium in allen , texas seats 18 , 000 and cost 60 million to build"
11046,high school football in texas is a whole different thing . it is still a tough profession for those that make it . engineers make more in a lifetime than an nfl player .
11047,yeah remember that movie varsity blues ? football is pretty serious there . 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams .
11048,"wow ! just think in the 1960s , top bowlers , yes , bowlers ! , made twice as much of the top football players of that era ."
11049,thats crazy since football players put themselves at risk everytime they play !
11050,"that's true . sadly , maryland's jordan mcnair died of heatstroke in june , so there are real risks ."
11051,"those humungous american flags at football stadiums weigh 1 , 100 pounds and cost 50 , 000 to make"
11052,spared no expense i guess . they will be rolling out those flags this weekend as the playoffs are starting with the final field of six teams in each conference decided last week .
11053,who is in the playoffs ?
11054,"the american football conference has kansas city , new england , la chargers , indianapolis , houston , and baltimore ."
11055,"nice , who is your team ? or who are you rooting for"
11056,"i have a soft spot for the patriots , but would like to see either kansas city or the chargers win it . by the way , in the national football conference it is new orleans , la rams , chicago , philadelphia , seattle , and dallas ."
11057,"nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
11058,"funny how they invest so much , but then a team like new orleans goes even further and forbids players and cheerleaders from eating at the same restaurant . sadly , if the cheerleader is there first and a player comes in , the cheerleader has to leave !"
11059,haha thats ridiculous ! cheerleaders also dont get paid for travel expenses . i knew someone who was a cheerleader for the lakers
11060,that's really cool . did she have a lot of stories ?
11061,"not really , she wasnt allowed to interact with the players at all . plus , it was just her side job ."
11062,i bet she had the best seat in the house for home games . great chat !
11063,are you a fan of the nfl ?
11064,i am a fan of the nfl ! what about you ?
11065,"me too , and college football ! do you have a favorite team"
11066,i like the ravens and the eagles . have you heard about the university of iowa's locker room ?
11067,"i have heard of them , they are my favorite team . i like the pink look to it , what do you think of it ?"
11068,i wonder if it is a mental thing to throw off the opponents ?
11069,"it is , it is basically psychology 101 . pink has a natural calming effect and relaxes the players lol"
11070,interesting . do you know how much bowlers made in the 1960s ?
11071,"i don't know exactly , but i know it was almost double the nfl salary , which is crazy to think about"
11072,i know ! i guess bowling was more popular back in the day .
11073,i think so too . bowling is fun but i can't wait it like football . do you listen to the radio much ?
11074,"yes , i love the radio . what about you ?"
11075,"me too , nothing like cruising to work listening to some rock on the radio , what do you listen to ?"
11076,a little bit of everything . sometimes you can even hear the jupiter radio storms !
11077,"i heard that , i wonder how that works , i know it is am but how do you know what it sounds like lol"
11078,i am not sure . i am assuming it just sounds like static .
11079,"good point , lol . i wonder if it a slightly different static sound . i need to youtube that one ! have you heard of foxhole radios ?"
11080,is that from soldiers in wwii ?
11081,"yep , they made them with razor blades and a pencil , i wonder how they made it work"
11082,that is so fascinating . yes i have no idea how that turns into a radio .
11083,"me neither , straight engineering lol . it was so nice chatting with you ! enjoy your night !"
11084,are you a fan of football ?
11085,i love football . i am a steelers fan . how about you ?
11086,my team is the redskins to be honest .
11087,did you know the highest score ever in a football game was 222 0 .
11088,no i didn't . do you know what team it was ?
11089,yeah it was georgia tech vs cumberland . geeorgia tech stomped them on that day in 1916 .
11090,hilarious . i didn't even know georgia tech was around back then . go figure .
11091,well in the 1960s football players made a lot less money . in fact top bowlers actually made more money .
11092,interesting . have you seen that movie kingpin with bill murray ?
11093,i dont think i have saw that one . is it good ?
11094,well it is about bowlers in the 60s and how they are semi celebrities .
11095,i might have to check that one out . did you hear about espn winning the award for the yello line that shows first down marker ?
11096,"i did , i wonder if they won awards for the thing that follows the hockey puck in hockey ?"
11097,i dont watch hockey so im not even sure what your talking about to be honest with you .
11098,"lol , no worries . do you listen to the radio ?"
11099,i was just listening to jupiters radio storms on am radio last night .
11100,"interesting , what station was it on ?"
11101,i just remember that t was on am radio . i listen to that when i get tired of listening to all the classical radio dramas . there is a website for that .
11102,interesting . did you know you can make a radio out of a razorblade and pencil ?
11103,yeah i would love to try to build one . you know just to see if i can .
11104,"that would be cool . well , nice chatting with you !"
11105,nice chatting with you as well . have a great day .
11106,"hey , how you doing there ?"
11107,wonderful how about you
11108,i'm great ! have you heard of the sport called football ?
11109,yes ! i live in america and just watched the super bowl ! what about you ?
11110,sometimes i watch the sb . i think it's funny that n the 60's bowlers made twice as much as top football stars .
11111,also find that funny . are you from the us ?
11112,i am . i grew up there . many of my friends are american . are you from the us ?
11113,yes i am . crazy that there are no written rules against female players
11114,"i think that women would add class to the game . they could be punters , kickers , place holders . they are a bunch of jobs that women could do !"
11115,female soccer players should be punters .
11116,"or kickers . that would be great ! little girls would dream of becoming football players ! then again , they should probably dream of being engineers . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player ."
11117,i am guessing that is because their career lengths are longer .
11118,"that's true . plus you gotta be real smart , and i am certainly not that . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . that's pretty good pay on a per minute basis ."
11119,haha radios in canada are requires 40 percent of music played to be canadian .
11120,canadians want equality ! they want to make sure that their own artists get airplay .
11121,seriously ! guess it is not the worst idea .
11122,i think the storms on jupiter probably sound better than most of the top 40 on the radio these days .
11123,i definitely agree with that . crazy that radios can pick up the storms in jupiter .
11124,"there are many crazy things on the radio these days , a finnish radio station has broadcast 'nuntii latini' a weekly news program conducted entirely in classical latin"
11125,that is fascinating .
11126,"i know ! isn't it ? anyhows , nice chatting with youse !"
11127,you as well !
11128,oh yeah .
11129,hey there do you like watching football
11130,hi ! i love watching football . my favorite team is the green bay packers . how about you ?
11131,"oh i love the patriots , i love watching the games but its sad but true theres only 11 mins of gameplay on average in the whole game"
11132,that's crazy once you think about it ! the games last for about 3 hours and they only play for 3 . makes me wonder how in shape they truly are then lol
11133,"haha good question ! , what are your thoughts on the chips that the nfl uses to track players ?"
11134,"i never knew about that until now and i don't like it ! there's already replay allowed , i don't need every player tracked to tell me more info . what do you think of it ?"
11135,"ya it is scary , its good for stats because it shows velocity and rotation and stuff , i just want to keep it on the field ya know"
11136,very true ! what do you think about the highest scoring game as coming from college ? crazy high too !
11137,ya that score is insane ! 2220 cumberland must have felt horrible
11138,i'm surprised georgia tech even kept trying . . . at that point i think you'd give pity . do you prefer to watch games on tv or listen to them on the radio ?
11139,"well i like to watch games , i dont use the radio much , do you ?"
11140,i prefer to watch the games . it's difficult when they're talking about players numbers and position on the field to envision it all at once .
11141,"right i agree with you , good thing espn created the yellow line , it makes it easier to follow the games on tv"
11142,i love the yellow line ! what do you think about ' football ' in other countries . . . aka soccer or rugby ?
11143,"well i don't like it myself , i like football , but yes i'm glad espn won an emmy for that !"
11144,"i enjoy watching soccer during the world cup or in olympics , but that's about it . funny what an emmy can be won for !"
11145,"thats true , do you ever watch bowling on tv ?"
11146,"no , i'm not a fan of watching bowling , but i do enjoy going bowling at times . what do you think about the saints cheerleaders having to leave a restaurant if a player comes in ?"
11147,"ya i think thats really dumb and outdated , i'm shocked they don't sue or sometihing over that , everyone is so sue happy these days"
11148,"yes . it's bad enough that they can't be in the same restaurant , but to have to leave when you were there first . . . barbaric !"
11149,"i agree with you on that , they should use the radio to warn each other where they will be at all times haha"
11150,"hi , how are you ? do you listen to the radio ?"
11151,"hey there i do listen to the radio sometimes , i didn't know that you could create a radio out of a razor blade in a pencil though , did you know that ?"
11152,i did not know that . i wonder how good that radio is though . what can it pick up ?
11153,yes i have no idea how it works . but i do know that they used it in world war ii
11154,that is quite inventive in any case . i dont listen to radio much now . i did when i was younger .
11155,yes i agree . i mostly just listen to youtube when i'm in the car . do you ever listen to canadian radio by the way ?
11156,i have listened to canadian radio . it is mostly like american radio .
11157,"the one thing that is different is that it is required to have 40 percent canadian conent , so that means that 40 percent of the radio time is made up of canadian artists"
11158,"yeah , i remember hearing a lot of rush , neil young , loverboy . that makes sense ."
11159,yeah and there's probably some justin bieber being played too haha . would you ever listen to a jupiter radio storm on your radio by the way ?
11160,i cant imagine listening to a storm on jupiter . maybe the solar activity on the sun ?
11161,"yeah that might be interesting , it also might be interesting to listen to a new station that is red in classical latin because i would not understand any of it lol"
11162,"how many people actually listen to broadcast , i wonder . it is an odd taste , thats for sure ."
11163,"yes i wonder how many people can understand classical latin these days , and apparently there is a online radio station that will play thousands of episodes of radio dramas , and they are completely free , i wonder if they are any good"
11164,i would rather listen to those old radio shows . they sound more intereesting . i dont think the kids are interested though .
11165,"no i think you're right unfortunately . on a separate note though , do you ever listen to football on the radio ? apparently women are allowed to play for the nfl if they are good enough"
11166,i dont listen to football on the radio . i used to listen to baseball on the radio . women in the nfl ? i wonder if that will ever happen .
11167,"yeah i don't know . but i also don't know how an average nfl game only has about 10 minutes of live gameplay , especially since it seems to take hours to watch on tv lol"
11168,"yeah , the spectacle draws a lot of interest , but really it is short lived . i just watch the highlights . that is enough . anyway , great chat !"
11169,"yes great chat . and next time you're watching again look out for the tracking chips that the nfl puts in the player shoulder pads , they can tell all kinds of stats just from how those chips are moving like velocity and rotation !"
11170,thats true ! have a good night !
11171,"thank you you too ! and keep in mind that the nfl was created 1920 , it's so long ago so that probably explains their crazy rules"
11172,are you a football fan ?
11173,sure ! i like the nfl . how about you ?
11174,i like it . i wonder if we'll ever see a woman play in it .
11175,"yeah , that would be cool . though , i can't blame women for not wanting to be a part of a notoriously sexist industry ."
11176,there's no written rule that says they can't play . maybe we could see a woman kicker one day .
11177,"yeah , i've read that somewhere . i just don't think women would necessarily want to be a part of the industry . it doesn't seem like a comfortable working environment . do you have a favorite nfl team ?"
11178,i'm a redskins fan . what about you ?
11179,i like the cowboys . did you know the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 ?
11180,i remember hearing that . they were probably paid in pennies . bowlers used to make more money than them .
11181,"that's crazy . coaches are paid really well , too ."
11182,do you ever listen to games on the radio ?
11183,"sometimes , but i do love the radio . it's kind of nostalgic ."
11184,yeah . did you know that soldiers used to make radio out of razorblades as pencils ?
11185,"yeah , they called them foxhole radios . i wonder what they could pick up on them ."
11186,who knows . maybe jupiter . jupiter has storms so big that you can hear them on am radio .
11187,"that's pretty cool . or more likely , bing crosby . evidently , they estimate that bing crosby recordings filled over half the radio time allocated for music in 1948 ."
11188,"wow , that's crazy . in canada , 40 percent of the music you play has to be from canadian artists ."
11189,that's very patriotic of them . did you know there's a radio station that translates solar activity ?
11190,i did not . i've heard about a radio station in finland that is conducted entirely in latin .
11191,"that's cool . but yeah , not only does the radio station translate the sun , you can listen to the sun's music . i wonder what it sounds like . well , it's been nice chatting with you !"
11192,i wonder the same thing . take care .
11193,"hello , do you like football ?"
11194,"hi . it's not my favorite thing in the world , but i am surprised that there is a rocket scientist who coaches ."
11195,hello . did you know iowa painted the opposing team locker room pink ?
11196,"i did . that's hilarious , and it must have been an intimidation tactic . i wonder if gt had theirs painted pink during that 2220 win over cumberland ?"
11197,lol . that's such a crazy score for a football game .
11198,it is . did you know that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's school ? i wonder if it is rapped .
11199,i did not know that . greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
11200,"that's amazing . i'm more than a little annoyed to realize that the highest paid employees in the department of defense , are football coaches . that needs to be rethought ."
11201,i think so too . do you listen to the radio ?
11202,"i do . i'm trying to find that station that translates solar sound , so you can listen to the music of the sun ."
11203,that would be very cool . i heard you can hear jupiter storms on earth .
11204,i would like to hear those too . i didn't know bill murray voiced a radio show in the 70's .
11205,"that's funny i didn't know that either . in canada , it's a law for all radio stations to play at least 40 percent of canadian music ."
11206,"are there even that many canadian artists ? i cannot believe that there are people who don't know who hanson is , and that the dj in chicago was able to get away with playing it on an alternative station ."
11207,i have no idea lol . soldiers in wwii made simple radios using a razorblade and pencil as the diode .
11208,"my grandfather showed me how to do that . i guess bing crosby was very popular in 1948 , he dominated the airplay ."
11209,that's interesting . do you like the nfl ?
11210,it's okay . i hear there is a coach who used to be a rocket scientist .
11211,i have heard that too . wonder if he made the embedded chips to track players ?
11212,"maybe ? or the ones in the footballs ? i think he was an aeronautics engineer , that would make sense if he was involved ."
11213,"i think it's in their pads . anyway , it was great talking to you !"
11214,so do you know much about football ?
11215,"i know its a league consisting of 32 teams . : , i watch some , grew up with it in the house ."
11216,"i don't know too much , i do know that iowa's visitor's locker is painted pink !"
11217,"that's crazy . women players are allowed , there's no written rule against them ."
11218,really ? i didn't know that ! good thing !
11219,"an average game only has 11 actual minutes of gameplay ! those games take hours , i can't believe how little of it is actually athletic ."
11220,"wow ! they seem so much longer . the players seem to make a lot of money , but over a lifetime , engineers will , make more ."
11221,no way ! that's one of those crazy hard to believe facts . like that new orleans saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a player comes in to eat while they are there .
11222,what ? that's insane ? but there are no rules against them playing ?
11223,"i've heard it from a reliable source : , they still have to meet eligibility requirements , just like the men have to ."
11224,funny . i heard that the highest score in a game was 2220 ! must have been a great game to watch !
11225,only if you were on the winning side . imagine how awful the losing team felt .
11226,"ha ! i know , it must be horrible to live with that for the rest of your life ! !"
11227,"well at least it happened in 1916 , no one heard about it like they would in today's world ."
11228,"very true ! speaking of a while ago , you know that top bowlers made 2x more than top football player in the 60's ?"
11229,bowlers were definitely top tier in the 60's . how funny is that ?
11230,"i know , but you think of how much football players make now , its crazy !"
11231,all professional athletes are paid a lot . like a ridiculous amount really . it's crazy to think about .
11232,i know that's why i was happy to see that engineers make more over a lifetime . even though many professions should .
11233,that is definitely true . my ex is an engineer and he pulls in bank .
11234,i guess a lot comes with being a football player . the nfl actually uses tracking chips to record their movements on the field .
11235,that's nuts . nice chatting with you !
11236,do you like football ?
11237,i do . u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
11238,i wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on them
11239,i wonder too . bowlers made more than them in the 60s too
11240,yeah . do you know the highest score in college football ?
11241,yes it was 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
11242,yeah and that was back in 1916
11243,yeah and still holds . did you know espn won and emmy once ?
11244,yes that was for the superimposed yellow line
11245,"i am glad they did that , it has made game watching easier"
11246,true . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
11247,yes the guy that never fumbled the ball . do you watch tv ?
11248,yes i do . do you like the simpsons ?
11249,i sure do . there is an episode where bart does not appear
11250,yes and he is not even mentioned in it
11251,yeah . how about that 70s show ?
11252,i liked it but it really flopped in the uk
11253,yes after just 10 episodes because it was remade verbatim
11254,yeah . did you ever see pokemon ?
11255,yes i have seen only some of the 750 episodes that are out there
11256,yeah that is a lot . nice chat today
11257,same here
11258,"hi , how are you ? are you following the colin kaepernick or eric reid drama ?"
11259,"reid , 26 year old pick out of lsu , played some linebacker out of necessity in 2017"
11260,"yes he did . he is in the middle of a lawsuit against the nfl for collusion . since he is a top safety , i think he has a good case . . ."
11261,"he tweet ' people who know football know who can play . people who know me , know my character ' ."
11262,"yeah , he's really talented and shouldn't have been out of the league at all . for a simple protest not to kil african americans at a disproportional rate compared to whites ."
11263,"football is a family of team sports that involve , but we become one nation to achieve for the nation ."
11264,"although some find him cowardly , i find kaepernick extremely brave for giving up football to take a stand against police killing his people . what are your thoughts ."
11265,he is best player but the football missed him very much .
11266,"yeah . i get sad when people bang on him but i find him strong and able to start the movement . i find more white people unwilling to learn about him and the movement , which makes it tough to argue with them . . ."
11267,television sometimes shortened to tele is a great communication medium .
11268,"yes , it is . is there a favorite communication meidum that you like ?"
11269,very much . television is a mass medium for advertising .
11270,that's interesteding . i really like to watch sports on tv . do you ?
11271,for watching football only i buy the tv . what your favourate team ?
11272,i am from chicago and move the bears . what about you ?
11273,i move to atlanta . you played tennis ?
11274,"sorry , love the chciago bears . i do enjoy tennis . you ? are you watching the australian open on tv ?"
11275,some time i watch it . wimbledon is my favourite tournament .
11276,nice . . . i want to eventually go and watch that tournament . i think it would be fun . but i also think i would be soooo hot in the stands . is tennnis your favorite sport ?
11277,"yes , its one man show . strong body and mental required for it ."
11278,sounds good . nice chatting with you .
11279,"i didn't know that there is only 1 episode of ' the simpsons ' where bart neither appears , nor is mentioned"
11280,"well , i much less , i find out . and i see that program , i like it"
11281,"did you know that the highest score in football game was 2220 , but it was really while ago . it's surprising fact ."
11282,"yes , i had read something in particular about it , it's something surprising . they should have played alone in the field , that team weighed the other"
11283,i was always surprised that there isn't any written rule against female players in nfl . and still don't understand why women don't play
11284,"it's a very strange thing , there are many women capable for these types of sports , but good ."
11285,"i agree . well , maybe with average nfl game only 11 minutes of live gameplay , it's not interesting for ladies ."
11286,there will come a time when the first will be encouraged and so will the others
11287,did you know that new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player
11288,"how curious is that ? well , i have some thought of some because of it , but . what do you think ?"
11289,i think it's kind of stupid and old style rule . it doesn't make any sense .
11290,"well , i suppose it's because of creating bonds in the middle of all this , it's not good for players to have their head in something else"
11291,": , it could be true . however , to require to leave a place when nfl player comes . . . well , i'm not sure in that . . ."
11292,"we are not sure of anything , they are pure speculations . . . but we must not remove the possibility"
11293,true . did you know that locker room for visiting team in the university of iowa is completely painted pink ?
11294,"or yes , yes . . . also today something about this , it is rumored that it is for the visiting team to know that they are better and this feels less"
11295,"some people may call it as sort of pressure , but i'm not sure ."
11296,"to me that could cause me rather desire to cover their mouths and beat them to learn . but hey , all this is part of the show"
11297,i agree . nfl is all about performance !
11298,"well of course . what is worth there is the best performance , the better the teams , the better the matches"
11299,yes ! my pleasure to talk with you . have a good day !
11300,"also , have a great day"
11301,hello hows it going ? do you like football ? i didn't know women can play in the nfl .
11302,i didn't know that either ! it's possible they only allow it because they think it very unlikely a woman will make a team .
11303,"yeah , i don't ever see any play for the nfl though lol maybe they just value their health , it is scary being a football player they get injured all the time"
11304,"yeah , i wonder if that is why they don't make more than the average engineer ! their careers tend to be short with all of the injuries"
11305,"it looks like the use to technology has been beneficial to football , they put tracking chips in their players !"
11306,"that is crazy to me , the technology that is in nfl games now . like how they were saying that the last time that jim nantz called a dallaswashington game , it was so much less technical . no first down lines , no fancy replays ."
11307,"the replays nowadays are excellent , the frame by frame picture and the playback and forward . its amazing . also , the way the announcers can kinda draw on the screen , really techy stuff ."
11308,i can't decide if i like the technology or not . it helps make things fair and makes it nice to watch . but it probably slows things down . it was pretty eyeopening that an average game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay
11309,"yeah , you are probably right , 11 minutes of game play but the actual event last like 3 hours ! lol"
11310,"yep , though somehow , i still watch and enjoy the games . i can actually remember the season that jim last called that game , because the cowboys beat my team that year when they won the superbowl ! crazy to think back that far"
11311,in the 1960 s bowlers made more than football players . i guess a lot more people watched bowling more back then !
11312,"ha ! i can't even imagine that . it shows how much football has changed in the last 60 years , how much players earn now versus then"
11313,"i know right , super interesting what was more popular back then ."
11314,"i guess i am a pretty casual fan , because i had never noticed the ' crossflexing ' thing before . it is interesting how much they play the ratings numbers now , to get the best games at the best times . i didn't know that 80 percent of the country got that late afternoon game"
11315,"that is a weird tactic , painting the opposing teams locker room pink ? i wonder what that does ?"
11316,"anything to get inside their head , i guess ! i guess it is implying they're girly ? the thing that stuck out to me as being the oddest fact was that the saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as an nfl player ! i wonder what the reason for that is"
11317,"probably they can't interact with football players because a distraction ? maybe . it's pretty rude , like what if they are not done eating ! ?"
11318,"the nfl really is kind of a crazy thing , because this country is just so into it . i can't even believe the tv contracts . a billion dollars for the rights to just half of the games is nuts ! but they can make money on it because the country is full of such rabid fans"
11319,"true , football is a huge money maker . i kinda don't understand it though , like why its so popular , so many breaks , only 11 min of gameplay , injured all the time , a ton of penalties , switching out players , offense and defense etc ."
11320,"in a close game , the slow pace kind of makes the splash plays that much more exciting . then again there are games like that last cowboysredskins game they mentioned , where the cowboys just racked up 38 unanswered points . and when it's that easy for a team , it's kind of fun to watch your team do well like that ."
11321,"true . its good chatting , see ya !"
11322,are you a fan of either the redskins or cowboys ?
11323,well i prefer the redskins personally . but i do think the cowboys have a good team this year . what do you think ?
11324,"i also like the redskins but the cowboys have a better team , at least this season ,"
11325,yep i agree . what do you think about the cowboys coach jason garrett ? i think he's definitely on the ball right now
11326,"i think he was a great backup for aikman and he is goind a good job , he just needs a better team to get to the superbowl"
11327,"speaking of football , what do you think about the nfl ? who's your favorite team"
11328,"i love the nfl , my favorite team are the patriots . they are the best team in the league now"
11329,yes i also love the patriots and i love tom brady ! do you think that the nfl will ever have female players in it though
11330,"i dont think so , they seem to be at a disadvange there , its a game of strength so maybe as a kicker"
11331,"yes i could see a kicker , i also could see them putting tracking chips on female players in order to compare the stats to male players"
11332,"i heard the balls also have a tracking chip in them , used to get different interesting stats of the dame"
11333,"yes they can get things like rotation and velocity of the ball which is interesting , i wonder if that's how they figured out that there are only about 11 minutes of gameplay in an average nfl game"
11334,"only 11 minutes ? that seems unfair for the public , last superbowl lasted like 3 hours"
11335,yep i agree that's a lot of commercials lol . did you watch the super bowl on tv or did you go to the game
11336,"on tv tickets are just too expensive for my budget , great game though , watched it with friends at home , what about you ?"
11337,"guess i watched it on tv . that's about the only time when i do watch tv because i mostly watched youtube stuff , i always like to watch south park as well what about you"
11338,"south park was one of my favorite shows i also liked the simpsons ,"
11339,did you ever see the episode where south park made fun of family guy ? and then apparently afterwards the simpsons creator sent south park flowers because the show was so spoton lol
11340,"i did , that was a funny one , i guess the crew from both shows are friends with each other"
11341,"yes i think so . did you ever watch the show pokemon by the way ? i watched it a lot when i was in middle school , and apparently there are over 800 episodes now . i would never be able to ' catch ' them all"
11342,"i used to love the show , watched the original series with 150 pokemons ,"
11343,i watch far too much tv . are you a fan of television ?
11344,"yea , i like watching snl , their longest running skit is weekend update"
11345,i love that skit . are you a fan of the simpsons ?
11346,"yea , i love homer . in the first 400 episodes he held 188 jobs !"
11347,wow ! that's an insane amount of jobs . did you know there is only one episode where bart does not appear and is not mentioned ?
11348,"no , that's crazy considering how many episode there are . they recently had daniel radcliffe do a voice on treehouse of horror xxi"
11349,i did not know that . i missed it . did you see the family guy episode of south park where they pointed out that family guy ripped off the simpsons format ?
11350,"yea , those south park episodes were fun to watch on tv"
11351,i agree . after that episode aired the simpsons crew sent the south park crew flowers ha ha .
11352,nice . have you ever watched shark tank ? it turns out most deals on the show are never enacted
11353,i am aware of it and how it works but i've never seen an episode .
11354,quite deceptive . apparently shakespare's the two noble kinsmen has never been adapted for tv or film
11355,i would have thought they were all adapted by now . are you aware of the show thomas the tank engine ?
11356,"yea , i've seen a few episode on the telly as a kid"
11357,"did you know that ringo starr , alec baldwin , and george carlin have all narrated for the show ?"
11358,"no , that's pretty crazy . did you know the player in football games have tracking chips embedded in their equipment ?"
11359,i did hear that it was on their person and also on the football . i wonder what they use that data for ?
11360,"i know they use the chips to track the footballs velocity , speed , rotation , and location"
11361,i wonder why they don't use that data to help make calls then instead of just relying on reviews ?
11362,the nfl should also use the data from the chips to help with players safety
11363,i agree with that as well .
11364,"hello , do you like football ?"
11365,"sure , i'm a big cowboys fan , personally . how about you ?"
11366,"i dont really follow football too much , but i watch it once in awhile , i like the 49ers ."
11367,"yeah , i find it hard to avoid after awhile . considering the regular season runs practically four months , then has several months of postseason , it can get a little ' in your face ' on television ."
11368,"absolutely , sometimes i dont even realize im watching it , like on thanksgiving or something lol"
11369,"and then finally , the first sunday in february when everything shuts down for the super bowl ."
11370,"yeah , i hear ya lol did you know the nfl uses tracking chips ?"
11371,"yeah , on both the players and the balls ? they want to be able to track everything , i guess ."
11372,yeah i guess stats mean a lot in that sport . its kinda sad that there is only 11 min of game play yet the event probably takes about 3 hours .
11373,that must be one of the many reasons engineers make more money over a lifetime than a football player .
11374,yeah and the injuries ! you hardly hear about an engineer getting injured affecting his career .
11375,"haha . yeah , you rarely hear about an engineer only have a fifteen year career because his body finally gave out on him ."
11376,"right ! maybe they would get a sprained wrist from being at the computer so much , but usually nothing serious . lol"
11377,"they're too busy getting paid and making the tracking chips that go in footballs to worry about it . did you know back in the 60s , bowlers actually made more than football players ?"
11378,"that is really amazing , real good time to be a bowler !"
11379,definitely . did you know there's no written rule preventing women from playing in the nfl ?
11380,"i did , i had no idea before i read it . i wonder why we dont see more women playing football ."
11381,"probably because it's an incredibly sexist industry , and would be a very hostile working environment ."
11382,well there are very masculine women who train and build up to play those types of sports . i've seen them at the gym . i met a woman who played rugby before !
11383,"oh , definitely ! i'm not saying women aren't capable of playing . i'm saying the league is very unfair toward women . they look away from the wifebeating and sexual harassment scandals . in fact , a saints cheerleader has to get up from the restaurant where she is eating if a player walks in ."
11384,yeah that is very rude . why not come up with an itinerary so cheerleaders know not to go there instead of that happening where they might have to leave mid meal . . anyways been great chatting !
11385,do you like the nfl ?
11386,"i do actually , did you know that women can play too ?"
11387,yes there is not rule that prevents them from playing
11388,yes as long as they can meet the requirements they are good to play
11389,yeah . did you know there are only 11 minutes of gameplay ?
11390,yeah and yet we are glued to the tv for hours
11391,yeah . did you know engineers make more money though over the lifetime ?
11392,well they do have longer careers too though so that makes sense
11393,yeah they have more time to make money if you think it that way
11394,yeah . did you hear of that rule for saints cheerleaders ?
11395,yes they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players
11396,"yes and worst , they also have to leave mid meal when they walk in"
11397,yeah it is sexist and it needs to go really
11398,i agree . u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
11399,wow i wonder if that is supposed to have some impact on them
11400,i wonder too . bowlers made more money in the 60s that football players
11401,wow i guess it was a much more popular sport back in the day than football
11402,yeah true . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
11403,yes it is 2220 and georgia tech beat cumberland
11404,yeah what a score that must have been even for 1916
11405,yeah that is crazy good . nice chatting with you .
11406,what do you think about eric reid ? you think people are not signing him because he's bad or because he won't stand for the national anthem
11407,i would think that would be a reason why teams weren't signing the 2013 first round pick out of lsu .
11408,yep i think so . him and colin kaepernick definitely got the short end of the straw after they started their activism
11409,yes they did . they first did it before a game in sept . of 2016 and have had nothing but problems since then .
11410,yep it's interesting that he had an 8 . 4 million dollar contract and he essentially threw it away by refusing to stand
11411,wow . i didn't now how much it cost him . i do know though that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher compared to that of the lifetime earnings of an average nfl or mlb player .
11412,"yep you're right about that . also the average nfl game only last for about 10 minutes of actual gameplay , the rest is just referees and standing around lol"
11413,"lol for that short amount of time , they do a good job of dragging it out to 3 hours . did you know there's no written rule against female players ? i wonder if we'll see on at some point . . . maybe a kicker ?"
11414,"that's what i'm thinking , we could probably see a kicker , i just hope that she can attend a restaurant with other players , unlike cheerleaders , they're not allowed and they have to leave if a football player enters the restaurant"
11415,that is the strangest rule . what do you think of the tracking chips they are using to record data in players shoulder pads and footballs ? seems like they're are really getting technical .
11416,"i think it's interesting that they can track the stats like rotation and speed , i just hope they can turn the tracking off once the players leave the field"
11417,yes . do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was ?
11418,yes it was between georgia tech and cumberland right ? wasn't the score like 222 to 0 or something crazy
11419,holy smokes ! that's a blowout . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of that era . times have changed since then .
11420,yep it's definitely the reverse these days . did you know that espn won an emmy ? they did it when they created the yellow line it shows first downs on tv broadcasts of football games
11421,i didn't know they won one for that . i love that line . changed the way we watch football . do you watch a lot of television ?
11422,"yes i watch television from time to time , i really like watching pokemon because it reminds me of my childhood , they're almost 800 episodes now"
11423,"wow . my kids were really into it , and even now they are in their 20s they still love it haha , . did you ever watch that 70s show ?"
11424,yes i used to watch that show a lot . what i don't like is that they try to recreate it in the uk market . it actually flopped over there lol
11425,lol i heard about that . they called it days like these . did you know that in the simpsons there is only 1 episode that bart isn't in and isn't mentioned ?
11426,"that's what i heard but i never saw that episode , do you think they just forgot about him ? what do you think about the episode of southpark where they made fun of family guy ? afterwards the simpsons creator sent the south park creators a set of flowers"
11427,do you watch much television ?
11428,i love watching the telly ! do you have any favorite shows ? i like snl and the simpsons .
11429,"i like south park and family guy . simpsons i like also , but it has been a while . have you seen south park or family guy ?"
11430,"i like both of those ! in the first 400 episodes of the simpsons , homer has held 188 jobs !"
11431,that is so many lol . i always thought he just worked at the power plant
11432,same here ! lol weekend update on snl debuted on the first episode and has been their longest running skit . that has to be over 40 some odd years !
11433,"wow , i never knew that ! crazy . speaking of the simpsons before , did you know there is only one episode that bart wasn't in or even mentioned"
11434,i didn't know that ! did you ever watch shark tank ?
11435,"i used to watch here and there , interesting show for sure . a lot of people get a good shot on there ."
11436,yes . . . . i was surprised to discover though that most deals made on there are never enacted .
11437,"really ? i wonder why that is , do you know why ?"
11438,i have no idea . lol i just found out about it . another interesting tv fact is that only one of shakespeare's plays has not been adapted for a movie or tv the two noble kinsmen .
11439,"only one ? you would figure there would be many more , wow ! did you ever watch pokemon ?"
11440,i never really watch it but my kids always had it on . lol
11441,i always watched it growing up . there was like 750 total episodes . i wonder if they ever caught them all in that many lol
11442,wow . that's a lot . they might have too ! lol are you a football fan by any chance ?
11443,"i love football , i like both college and nfl , how about you ?"
11444,i'm a fan of both ! 14 of the worlds 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams !
11445,"i believe it , i know michigan's is huge . they are our rivals , i am an iowa hawkeye fan , ever heard of them ?"
11446,"i have ! who hasn't ? lol there's a high school stadium in allen , texas that seats 18 , 000 and cost 60 million to build . that's like a baseball stadium . lol"
11447,"that is so much for high school , i wonder why they built it lol . it was so nice chatting with you ! enjoy your night !"
11448,hey ! have you been keeping up with nfl games lately ?
11449,i like national football league . do you like it ?
11450,i enjoy watching the games and keeping up with it . my favorite team is the ravens . do you have a favorite ?
11451,"me also . the ravens are a professional american football team based in baltimore , maryland ."
11452,i hope to visit baltimore to see a home game some day . have you been watching their games this season ?
11453,sorry i do not see right now . did any important event happen ?
11454,"they lost to the chargers , unfortunately . it was an exciting game to see on tv though . the tv is great for keeping up with these games ."
11455,"oh , i missed it ."
11456,do you like to watch tv ?
11457,of course it is a great entertainment device . i like it very much . do you like to watch tv ?
11458,"i really like it too . i don't have as much time to watch as i would like to , but i have some shows i don't miss . what kind of shows do you like ?"
11459,"i was mostly like comedy shows , comedy movies , and thriller movies ."
11460,"i enjoy comedy too . do you prefer comedies with live actors , or animated cartoons ?"
11461,both are nice . mostly like actors .
11462,what is your favorite show ?
11463,i like parks and recreation .
11464,parks and rec is a really funny show . ron swanson always makes me laugh .
11465,"yes definitely , do you like this show ?"
11466,i do like it . it's very fun to watch .
11467,do you like pokemon ?
11468,"i watched it when i was a kid , but i haven't seen all 750 plus episodes !"
11469,"hello . did you watch the super bowl ? it was held on the first sunday in february , right on schedule ."
11470,yes i did . the afc champion patriots won the game
11471,"yup . . . again . . . . i'm a raven's fan . tony romo did a nice job . i wonder how jason witten would have done , but he's affiliated with espn so i'm not sure how that would have worked ."
11472,espn and the booger mobile are awful ! they lost their sports brodcasting background awhile ago . now its just social media and advertising
11473,"yup , i used to watch sports center religiously , now i might put it on once or twice a year . they really focus on the nfl , and would really be interested if they ever got a female player . after all , there is no written rule against it ."
11474,would she feel weird if she got drafted by the saints . where the players and cheerleaders are not allowed to eat at the same place ?
11475,"yeah , that would be awkward . she would walk in and the cheerleaders would have to leave ."
11476,jason witten was a very good player but still needs some work in the booth . maybe he can win espn another emmy
11477,"maybe some day . i liked him during his 15 year career , and drafted him on my fantasy football team several times ."
11478,he is second in rec and yards as a te . thats good fantasy production
11479,for sure . he and dez bryant back in the day made quite the pair . plus catching balls from troy aikman wasn't too shabby either .
11480,if the average nfl game only has 11 mins of live gameplay . i wonder how much time witten was actually used
11481,good point . i still like watching it on tv though . never seen any of the over 750 episodes of pokemon though .
11482,thats 16 years worth ! i dont think i would be able to stand the ads
11483,i don't i'd be able to stand the show . 50 a year ? i couldn't even get through one i bet .
11484,what about trying to find the 1 episode of the simpsons where bart is neither mentioned or appears
11485,at least i used to like that show . haven't seen it in years though . i tend to use tv as a mass medium for news . even though you need to take it in with a healthy bit of skepticism .
11486,i feel llike if it wasnt for news or sports tv wouldnt survive
11487,probably not . most of the shows are crap now a days .
11488,yeah a show called ' days like these ' only lasted 10 episodes in he uk
11489,"yes , i heard that somewhere before . well , it's been nice chatting with you ."
11490,have a good day !
11491,"hello there , are you an nfl fan ?"
11492,"hey there , ya i love the patriots , what about you ?"
11493,oh wow then you have been quite spoiled the last decade or so !
11494,"haha i have ! but not spoiled in once sense , nfl games only have about 11 minutes of gameplay haha"
11495,that is crazy when you think about it . i know you notice all the stops much more when you go to a live game .
11496,"ya thats true , i haven't been to a live game in a while , what game did you go to"
11497,oh i have been to packer games before and i just know you notice it more when going to the games .
11498,"ah i see , whats crazy is theres no rule against female players , would you watch females in the nfl ?"
11499,"i think that would be awesome , they should allow girls in all pro sports , it should be the best players possible ."
11500,"yup , if they are the best then they should be allowed to play i think"
11501,"exactly , and it would give young girls who are sports fans all kinds of hope and motivation ."
11502,"well they shouldn't be too enthused about the salary , do you know an engineer will make more than a pro nfl player ?"
11503,"yeah i read that , i think it is because the average nfl career is not that long vs . an engineer has a lifetime of working ."
11504,"ya that makes sense , doesn't make sense though the rules about the saints cheerleaders , did you hear about those ?"
11505,"yeah i read about those as well , that seems pretty outdated but who knows ."
11506,"ya , like having to get up and leave if a player walks into a bar or restaurant , it seems absurd"
11507,"right , it is a public place , as long as they're not breaking any actual laws that should be ok ."
11508,what do you think of the chips the nfl usees to track the ball and also players ?
11509,"i think its smart , they need to make the game as safe as possible , the hits to the head are dangerous ."
11510,"thats true , i just worry about those chips being used outside the game , thats scary stuff"
11511,"that is , well its been nice talking with you , i hope you have a good night ."
11512,do you watch the nfl ?
11513,i sure do . did you know that women can play too ?
11514,yes there are no rules that prevent them from playing
11515,"right , as long as they qualify for the game they can play"
11516,yeah . the average game play is only 11 minutes anyways
11517,exactly and yet we are glued to the tv forever
11518,i know . did you know engineers earn more than the players though
11519,yes i guess their careers are also longer so that makes sense
11520,true . did you hear of that saint cheerleaders rule ?
11521,the one that they are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players ?
11522,yeah and they also have to leave mid meal if they walk in
11523,it is so sexist and it really need to go by now
11524,i agree . they are also using tracking chips on the players now
11525,yes they collect info on velocity and rotation and a bunch of stuff
11526,i hope they can use that to make the game safer too
11527,good point . u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
11528,i wonder if that is supposed to have some impact on the players
11529,yeah me too . bowlers made more than football players in the 60s
11530,that blows my mind how things have changed now
11531,exactly . it was nice chatting with you
11532,"same here , have a good one"
11533,"hey how are you , do you watch football much ?"
11534,yes love nfl !
11535,"cool , me too . can you believe bowlers got paid more in the 60s than did the nfl players ?"
11536,that is crazy . did you know espn invented the yellow line ?
11537,"i did , i think they won an emmy for it too didn't they ? who is your favorite team ?"
11538,raidernation here and antonio brown ! ! ! maybe we can score 222 points like georgia tech now .
11539,"haha , score a few more points than cumberland did . ab84 to the raiders is pretty cool , he seems like a raider for sure ."
11540,i knew as of friday . a bunch of raider fans who are also warrior fans saw him at the warriors game . he got currys jersey from him !
11541,"that's cool , it is always nuts to remember that the warriors play in oakland , they seem like 2 very different teams ."
11542,not as of next season . they will be next to the sf giants lol . i bet lebron could play in nfl haha . probably not fumble like benjavus greenellis !
11543,"lebron would be unstoppable as a te for sure , he'd never fumble either . what do you mean by the sf giants will be close to them ?"
11544,they are moving to a new arena . it is almost done .
11545,"ah i gotcha , the raiders are going to las vegas the year after next right ?"
11546,"yeah , good thing there is only 11 minutes of actual play . it might be hot there lol ."
11547,it'll be getting really hot there . do you watch a lot of tv ?
11548,no worries . it is inside . i was kidding . yes i watch tv but i stream more .
11549,"yah , tv channels and stations are kind of rip offs now , you have to pay a ton of money each month and still watch a ton of commercials , not a very good deal . you ever watch any of the 750 episodes that were made of the show pokemon ?"
11550,it will take me 16 years if i watched one a week
11551,"that's a really long time for sure . i was rather surprised to hear that there are only two types of tvs still , black and white and colored tv . pretty soon there'll be vr tv lol ."
11552,i can watch netflix already with my vr headset ! i want to find that uk knock off of the 70's show lol .
11553,"that would be pretty cool , what if we're already in vr now though ? kind of freaky . i'm going to go for a walk though , it was great to chat with you , hope you have a great rest of the day !"
11554,"hi , how are you ?"
11555,"good , how are you ?"
11556,i am well . do you like football ?
11557,yes i do . how about you ? did you watch the superbowl ?
11558,i did . i was rooting for the patriots . who were you rooting for ?
11559,no one i was just watching it . the whole 11 minutes of gameplay
11560,ha ! that's not a lot of game play . did you know there is no rule against females playing ?
11561,yeah i wonder why they do not play though
11562,maybe because they could make more as an engineer .
11563,haha that is so true . it is sad how little players make really . the coaches make a lot though
11564,"yeah , they are usually the highest paid in the state ."
11565,yeah . snoop dog though wrote a song for his son's football team
11566,really ? iowa's visitng locker room is pink .
11567,wonder if there is a reason behind that
11568,psychological . i am not sure it works though because bowlers used to make more .
11569,they did for sure . do you know where is the largets high school football stadium in the us ?
11570,"no , where ?"
11571,"in allen , texas"
11572,wow . leave it to texas to put too much money into high school football .
11573,i know . it holds 18000 people and cost 60 million to build
11574,nice chatting with you !
11575,did you ever watch pokemon ? apparently there are over 750 episodes of it
11576,"i did , and i played pokemon go , did you play ?"
11577,"i did for a bit yes ! i didn't get a ton of pokemon but i did play and i liked it , i played the original red and blue versions on gameboy as a kid"
11578,"i liked paying the game , but it got redundant where i live . apparently , a lot of people played it ."
11579,"ya thats true , you have to travel to different places to get different pokemon , and only some pokemon were given away at special events , and some are locked to certain countries , it just seemed too impossible"
11580,"yeah , i liked the game . i also liked the show that 70s show , apparently they tried to make a uk version ."
11581,"ya i remember that , and it was cancelled after like 10 episodes ! oh well they're missing out over there"
11582,i didn't know that ringo starr voiced tank the engine though .
11583,"wow i didn't know that , i did know that george carlin did some voices for thomas the tank , i wish he would sneak in some jokes then i'd actually watch that show haha"
11584,"apparently the new tvs have oled , so does the new iphone . i'm debating whether or not to upgrade ."
11585,"ya i don't know , it depends what your current phone is , i have a pixel xl 2 so i have a great phone i'm good waiting for a while"
11586,"lol , i still have the iphone 5s , i've never used a case and dropped it a million times . it won't die ."
11587,"haha well that phone is pretty old , maybe get a new one so you can watch nfl games on it , apparently the average game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay"
11588,"not surprising , when i watch the games at the bar , it is mostly clock watching ."
11589,"ya , espeically near the end when they're using timeouts , i can't believe in teh 60's that bowlers made more than top football players"
11590,"i can believe it . that is crazy , but years ago bowling was likely a more popular sport ."
11591,"ya that's true , it was in the flintstones and everything haha , also crazy that an engineer will make more in their lifetime than the average football player , very shocking"
11592,it has to take into account for the players that don't last long and are low pay .
11593,"ya thats true , also the ones that get injured , did you like the simpsons as a kid ? theres only one episode where bart is both not mentioned and doesn't appear"
11594,"yeah , bart . he was hilarious back in the day . that show is great , i've only seen the first 5 seasons though ."
11595,"ya , after season 7 or 8 i think it went downhill , but i did love it as a kid !"
11596,good evening ! are you a football fan or at least looking forward to the super bowl tomorrow ?
11597,"i am looking forward to the super bowl tomorrow . most likely , i look forward to the halftime show . do you know who's performing ?"
11598,"i heard it is maroon 5 . i'm sure there set will be about 15 to 20 minutes long , which might actually be longer than the actual live gameplay of the game itself !"
11599,"then , i will definitely be looking forward to them . i hope they perform the old songs and maps ! however , i will be watching the whole game and the commercials ."
11600,"when it is actual game time , look out for the superimposed yellow first down line , which espn won an emmy for ."
11601,i remember that ! this is getting more exciting by every message i see . they deserve it !
11602,i'm glad that espn doesn't get the game though . have you heard any of their issues since taking over monday night football a while back ?
11603,"what do you mean that they don't get the game ? well , there are a few people considering the job ."
11604,"cbs hosts the game . obviously espn will be part of it , but i hope that the game is always on ' free ' tv . plus espn just hasn't done that great with the actual nfl games ."
11605,"now , it makes sense . is that sarcasm because it is never free ? nfl is good overall ."
11606,"i meant for the people watching since nbc , cbs , or fox usually host the game and those don't cost consumers , beyond the television and possibly an antenna , , whereas espn requires additional pay to watch ."
11607,"that is true . speaking of television , ' shark tank ' never enacted most deals . seems reasonable because the products that consumers create seem ridiculous to make it a reality ."
11608,"that is interesting and i never knew that ! it's hard for me not to see ' tank ' and not think of thomas the tank engine . did you know some famous stars like alec baldwin , ringo starr , and george carlin have all narrated the show ?"
11609,i remembered watching the episodes when i was little . and i heard about that ! that makes me want to do back and identify their voices .
11610,they all have such distinct voices too ! it's crazy to think in the relatively early days of television that bowlers made more than football stars .
11611,"actors make more money than bowlers and football players . however , i heard of that as well . i wish bowling was easy though ."
11612,"i think all sports tend to be tough because some people just really have a knack . while i think it might be difficult , maybe someday a woman will suit up and play in a super bowl since it is technically not against nfl rules ."
11613,"well , they have practices every other day to develop strength and stability . i believe so . look at high school football . coaches are welcoming of both genders to condition into football ."
11614,"yet despite all of that , new orleans saints cheerleaders can't even eat in the same restaurant as the players . if a player walks in the cheerleader has to leave ."
11615,isn't that a little sexist ?
11616,"i don't know the reason for the rule unless they just think it is a bad image ? great chat , enjoy the game and halftime show tomorrow !"
11617,did you know that trump wouldn't make the list of top 3 most wealthy presidents ?
11618,"no , but this is just his first term in office . . who knows what the future holds ? he might make a blockbuster pop album , like the president of indonesia , which might put him over the top !"
11619,haha that is true we can't count that out ! not just 1 but he could make 3 or more albums if he wants to top that president of indonesia !
11620,"who knows . he's friends with kanye west these days . it could happen ! i wonder if kanye stayed at the president's guest house when he came to washington recently . after all , the guest house is bigger than the white house !"
11621,"ya that is wild , you would think it'd be the opposite , can you imagine if we had the old rules where the runner up became vp ? hillary as vp and trump as president !"
11622,"i would love to hear trump say to hillary , ' you're fired ! ' i can't imagine the types of things the fake media would focus on then . with all the bizarre reporting , at least they don't call him president banana , which is what they called the first president of zimbabwe"
11623,"haha ya i would love for him to have her come into his office and then tell her she's fired , do you watch football at all ? i guess there is no rule against women playing for the nfl so we will probably see that in our lifetime if they are good enough"
11624,"that is true in the nfl , but i am not sure if it is true in other forms of football , like rugby , canadian football , gaelic football , etc . does that mean we would see male dallas cowboy cheerleaders too ?"
11625,"to be honest nothing would surprise me anymore , weren't they talking about making cheerleaders more equivalent and having men as cheerleaders ? like i am pretty sure that is a thing they're working on ."
11626,college football has male cheerleaders on the squads . i remember seeing them at a university of iowa game . i also heard that their visitors locker room was pink .
11627,"lol , that is funny , ya i saw that is in iowa's away team locker room , i'm frankly shocked the team wasn't arrested for intolerance or gender discrimination given today's overreactions and political climate"
11628,i think political correctness has gone too far lately .
11629,"ya now that sounds like a complete opposite of today , what is shocking to me is that there is only about 11 mins of actual live gameplay during an average football game , seems like that is low"
11630,"and most of that is hang time for punts ! lots of surprising trivia about football . did you know patriots running back , greenellis , has never fumbled the ball ? i wonder if he still plays for the pats and if so , if he will play this weekend ."
11631,"i did not know that , i hope that the pats win the superbowl again this year , tom brady is a great american"
11632,"well , i hope he stays healthy and can play a few more seasons . i'm sure he needs the cash an average lifetime earnings for an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings for an nfl player . and brady has a model wife he has to feed !"
11633,haha that is true ! i did read that his wife actually makes more money then he does . i don't know what she does but i found that to be really wild !
11634,i hope the score of the superbowl game is high . not as high as that historic 2220 georgia tech romp over cumberland !
11635,"that is true that's a crazy score ! i think once it hit 100 to 0 , i would just turn the game off and know which side was the winning team haha"
11636,"but if you turned the tv off , you would miss those emmy award winning virtual yellow lines espn puts on the field . that is worth the price of admission !"
11637,yes and i'd also miss the male cheerleads ! what would i ever do without both those things ! haha
11638,hey ! do you like football ?
11639,i sure do . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
11640,really ? that is too funny ! i bet the visitors love that ! do you like the cowboys football team at all ?
11641,"to be honest i do not have a favorite team , just enjoy watching the games"
11642,"oh , i am the same way . i was reading an article about the cowboys player dak prescott and his stance on protests during a football games national anthem . he says he feels at peace at games and won't protest with some other players , pretty interesting ."
11643,i see that is interesting . did you know that bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s ?
11644,"they did ? that is odd lol , you would never think that ! just like i couldn't believe the football game that was won with a score of 2220 that had to be a crazy game !"
11645,i know georgia tech made history by beating cumberland back in 1916
11646,"exactly ! i like the fact that the nfl has no written rules against a female becoming a player , as long as they meet all eligibility requirements . i wonder if there has ever been a female football player ."
11647,i wonder too . and i mean there are only 11 minutes of game play so maybe it is not that bad after all
11648,"true , but i wouldn't want to get tackled by a 250 pound man either lol , players can get as many as 60 hits per game . . . . no way lol , that's a lot . i would rather be an engineer and make more money than an nfl player does lol ."
11649,yeah i guess it makes more sense since engineers have longer careers as well
11650,"yep , but they keep their body and brain intact for sure . football is a rough sport . i wouldn't even want to be a saints nfl cheerleader , they can't even eat at the same restaurant as the players . . ."
11651,yes and the worst part is that they are required to leave mid meal too if the players walk in
11652,"that is a ridiculous rule , i wonder if that is still true or if the nfl has changed that rule . i hope so ."
11653,i hope so too because otherwise it is just so sexist and wrong
11654,"i definitely agree . i think the nfl is probably better at treating the cheerleaders better than that in current times . they need to concentrate on keeping track of the players skills by using the tracking chips in their shoulder pads , and in the football ."
11655,i know . maybe they can use the info to make the game safer
11656,exactly ! anything to make football safer is a good thing !
11657,yeah . on another topic do you know much about presidents ?
11658,"i don't really . i just do my duty and vote for whoever i think is best for our country , that's about it . i care but politics gets so crazy ."
11659,i know too much sometimes . nice chatting with you
11660,do you watch football ?
11661,yes i do . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
11662,i wonder if it is supposed to have some effect on the players
11663,i wonder too . bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s
11664,true . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
11665,"yes it is georgia tech versus cumberland , 2220"
11666,yeah pretty big for a game in 1916
11667,yeah i know . did you know espn won an emmy ?
11668,yes they won it for the superimposed yellow line
11669,yes i am glad they did because makes watching the game on tv easier
11670,true . did you know that women can play in the nfl too ?
11671,yes if they qualify and meet the requirements of the game
11672,yeah . the average game is only 11 minutes of active participation
11673,yes and we are yet glued to the tv for hours to an end
11674,true . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
11675,yeah about them not being able to eat in the same place as the players .
11676,yeah that is so sexist and really has to go by now
11677,i know and the worst is that they have to leave mid meal too if they walk in
11678,yeah true . do you know much about the presidents ?
11679,i sure do . do you know who the top three wealthiest ones are ?
11680,"yes that us washington , jfk and jefferson"
11681,do you know who emily dickson is ?
11682,"emily dickinson ? the poet ? i do ! ' tell all the truth , but tell it slant ' she once said . do you like her poetry ?"
11683,yeah she was an icon she died in 1886 at the tender age of 55 .
11684,"though she was reclusive , she lived an interesting 55 years . do you know much about her life ?"
11685,i did not unfortunately ! i hear over the years she shared at least 250 poems with susan her close friend before marrying austin .
11686,"yes . she wrote hundreds and hundreds of poems , but they were locked away in a drawer , and a critic said that there were many arresting phrases , nothing scanned or rhymed properly , and so he declined to help get them published ."
11687,did you kow theres a poem when read normally is depressing but when read backward is uplifting ?
11688,"wow ! that is certainly different than emily's poetry . there's such a diversity in poetry . it's no surprise , since poetry dates back to prehistorical times . did you know some of the first poetry was hunting poetry in africa ?"
11689,"yes and and extensively throughout the history of the empire of the nile , niger and volta river valleys ."
11690,"yes . some of the earliest written poetry in africa is found among pyramid texts , written during the 25th century , bce ! of course , poetry spread throughout the world , too ."
11691,"wow i did not know that . edgar allen poe received 9 . 00 for the raven , can you believe that ?"
11692,"just 9 ? you know , art , music , and poetry were once olympic sports ? can you imagine edgar allen poe as an olympian ?"
11693,i can not but the fact that those parts of our culture use to be in the olympics is amazing . they should bring that back .
11694,"yes , poetry does seem to have lost some respect . in the past , the vikings were warriorpoets , and poetry was considered a gift from odin himself ."
11695,now that's interesting . homers odyssey was one of my favorites .
11696,"ah yes ! quite an epic , isn't it ? and homer wrote the iliad , as well ."
11697,"bringing back so many memories , i think i might listen to that soon . demetri martin wrote a 224 word palindrome poem ."
11698,"funny ! you really can do so much with poetry ! there's also a poem that's 274 lines , and features about 800 irregularly pronounced english words . it's called the chaos . i'd like hear that one read out loud !"
11699,yeah that seems like the right name for it . do you listen to or play the piano ?
11700,funny you should ask ! i was just going to ask if you knew that they used to call typewriters ' literary pianos ' ! isn't that funny ? i like to bang on the keyboard every now and then ! what about you ?
11701,"that's all i do is bang on them while missing the keys i'm aiming for , lol ! nice chatting with you ."
11702,good thing you're not playing on an old steam piano ! they'd hear you for miles around ! goodbye !
11703,"well maybe not on mars , haha , goodbye ."
11704,did you know the richest superhero is black panther ?
11705,"is that the character in the 2018 film , or the actor who played the role ?"
11706,i think it is the character . i will check closer .
11707,okay . have you seen the film ? heard it was nominated for oscars . . .
11708,i haven't yet but i plan to .
11709,"me , too . understand that symbols and script were based on 4th century nigerian story . costume designer won an oscar , i think . . . deserved to , at least . . ."
11710,interesting . costume designing would be a fun occupation .
11711,"agree . one young star in the film , chadwick boseman , was sponsored to an oxford , england theater program by a ' private benefactor ' . turned out to be the great actor , denzel washington . fun fact ?"
11712,wow ! that is interesting .
11713,"glad script made black panther richest superhero , over characters like tony stark , iron man , and bruce wayne , batman , . why not ? ?"
11714,true ! if you want a superhero make him really rich .
11715,"and of noble ancestry ! this nearly allblack film is possibly the biggest performance work to come along since gershwin's black folk opera , porgy and bess . that was produced in the 1940's ! about time ? ?"
11716,that's amazing .
11717,"yes . disney studios owes something to the black community , too . in the 50's , disney did a really prejudiced film about blacks called ' song of the south ' . ever see it ? ?"
11718,there were so many racists shows back in the day . never saw that one .
11719,"true ! ! you didn't miss anything . marvel comics character was not named after the 70's black panther party , though studio almost called film , black leopard ."
11720,that doesn't sound as scary .
11721,"you're right ! don't think there are black leopards , are there ? ?"
11722,lol i don't know . you wouldn't be able to see their spots .
11723,"true . have a ' panther ' of sorts in my own house , snuggled by my feet at the moment . american shorthair with tiger stripes and leopardyellow eyes . about 5 months old . . . do you like cats ?"
11724,i like all animals . i dog sit a lot lately . it was nice chatting with you . i hope you have a nice day .
11725,what arts do you enjoy ? music ? poetry ?
11726,"hi there . i was an english major in college , so even though i took a lot of literature classes , i appreciate poetry , too . what about you ?"
11727,i took some poetry in high school and i still remember learning about palindromes
11728,did you know that the comedian demetri martin wrote a 224word palindrome poem ? that's a lot of thinking and reading backwards !
11729,i can't even begin to comprehend how it would go
11730,"there is also a poem that when read normally is depressing , but when read backwards is inspiring . i think that's impressive , as well ."
11731,i think that in itself is pretty inspiring
11732,"yes , some works of poetry like the epic of gilgamesh are pretty , well , epic , for lack of a better word haha . they try to take you to another time and place ."
11733,it is pretty amazing how literature allows us to build worlds within our minds
11734,"speaking of other worlds , isn't it crazy how much we've learned about mars , to the point where there's a colonization project planned for 2023 ?"
11735,didn't the plan to colonize mars recently get canceled ?
11736,"apparently this colonization is being funded by a reality tv show , although who knows if it is actually a viable idea . science and entertainment aren't always the best marriage ."
11737,"i mean when a single mistake can kill you , i don't think a reality tv show environment is conducive either"
11738,it's really one of the lower forms of entertainmentsdefinitely not up there with classical piano and such elevated forms of artistic expression . do you like piano music ?
11739,"i wonder if linchens and cyanobactera were planted on mars by people , would they evolve into new life forms ?"
11740,i bet the amount of time it would take for that would be longer than life on earth would be around to observe it haha .
11741,perhaps . i hope when they colonize mars they would at least bring along a piano
11742,"yes , although it it a luxury item that would probably increase the payload too much to be practical . also , due to atmospheric differences , the sounds it creates would have a higher pitch on mars ."
11743,perhaps they would make it somehow there ? i mean people a piano on the highest mountain peak in the uk .
11744,"the british can be pretty crazy . on april 18 , 1930 , the bbc broadcast piano music because they decided there was no news worth reporting ."
11745,i wouldn't say that is crazy . piano music is just that good . it has actually been used to deter crime successfully in public spaces
11746,"that's interesting . they've had about 300 years to perfect it since it was invented in italy around 1700 , so i hope it would be good !"
11747,"indeed . in any case , thank you for the pleasant chat . hope you have a wonderful day ."
11748,are you familiar with summit meetings ?
11749,"hello ! i know a little , how about you ?"
11750,i have a passing knowledge that they are meetings for international heads of state or government to discuss important topics and perhaps come to a mutually good agreement
11751,"yes , it is very important , the term summit was not used until the geneva summit back in 1955 , after the cold war era the number of sumiit events increased ."
11752,"they can also be very passive aggressive as when the canadian prime minister said ' i guess i will shake your hand , but i only have one thing to say . you need to get out of ukraine . '"
11753,"wow , i read that during a g20 summit , russia gave heads of state thumb drives and phones chargers that had trojan viruses to pick up their computer and phone data , that's pretty crazy !"
11754,i wonder if there were any real consequences when they were found out
11755,"i don't know but i would think that would cause a lot of problems to say the least . like back in 2007 an austrailian satire group impersonated the canadians and entered a secure zone of an apec of world leaders . . . they were only caught when one man was dressed as osama bin laden ,"
11756,"i understand they are doing something important , but i feel that sometimes what they are doing isn't as important like awarding eve online a world summit award for e content and creativity . recognition for the creators of the game is nice , but you would think they have bigger fish to fry"
11757,"right ? i would think the same thing ! i was reading about an olympic gold medalist getting a breast cancer diagnosis , she had reached the summit of the sport which she was a us pioneer . she won the 1st medal in cross country skiing for the us , do you watch the olympics ?"
11758,. i watch it as well as the fifa world cup
11759,"it is just sad she went from winning a gold medal and only 2 months into retirement . . . and gets such a bad diagnosis . she says she will beat it though , great frame of mind . yes , fifa is the most widely viewed and followed sport event in the world . the american team has never placed below 3rd since 1991 in the women's world cup ."
11760,i'm excited for the world up in qatar in 2022 despite the city not yet existing
11761,"i heard that ! i wonder how that is supposed to work lol , an non existing city . . . . but definitely exciting ! 17 countries have hosted the world cup , pretty awesome !"
11762,"i guess despite not net economic gains for hosting they do get benefits like prestige , recognition , and tourism that make it work investing in a high tech new city"
11763,"exactly , getting that many people in one place is surely good for the economy ."
11764,i think building the city would also generate jobs
11765,"right , and that is something that is needed . i like it that the us got 3rd place in the first fifa back in 1930 ."
11766,"indeed , given the us's impressive track record of always impressive at least 3rd since 1991 , i am looking forward to their performance in the next world cup . in any case , i thank you for the pleasing chat ."
11767,exactly . thank you so much it has been nice !
11768,to you as well . have a nice day .
11769,do you watch soccer ?
11770,i sure do . do you know where the world cup is taking place in 2022 ?
11771,yes in qatar but the city does not exist yet
11772,yeah . did you know the us got third place when the cup first started
11773,yes but since 1930 they have not done very well after that
11774,yeah i know but the women's team is still doing very well
11775,yeah very true . did you know host countries of the cup have no economic gains from it ?
11776,"and yet they bid on it to host it , i do not get it"
11777,yeah me either . do you have a favorite pair of shoes ?
11778,i think my runners as they are comfy and you ?
11779,me too . did you know stephon marbury always leaves his cleats in the field after the game ?
11780,"hmm do not know but know that he once promoted shoes for free , and they cost 15 each pair . so why ?"
11781,"wow , he did to promote homelessness . what a guy"
11782,did you know ballet dancer go through 4 pairs of shoes in a single week ?
11783,yes lots of shoes . did you know 5000 year old shoes are better than they are now ?
11784,"yeah that is pretty interesting , they need to crack that secret"
11785,right ? do you know how to keep your shoes smelling good ?
11786,"yes you can use tea bags , and it works super well"
11787,yeah they do . did you know in fashion shoes are sometimes just a decoration ?
11788,"strange but ok , . there are so many designs though based on culture alone"
11789,yes that is true and that determines if they have heels or not as well
11790,"hello , do you like soccer ?"
11791,yes . i sometimes watch the fifa world cup .
11792,nice . do you know that in 2022 will be held in qatar but no one knows the name of the city ?
11793,"wow , i feel for those that have to print stuff for it . i didn't realize the u . s . got 3rd place in the first fifa world cup in 1930 ."
11794,yeah but they have not done great since then . women's team has done great though
11795,i'm surprised that there are no economic gains for countries that host the world cup .
11796,yes they keep doing it . go figure . hungary did pretty well between 1950 and 1956 it seems
11797,i wonder how spain does . the are the only country that's a permanent guest at the g20 summit .
11798,yeah that one is interesting why they keep doing that . have you heard of eveonline game ?
11799,no . have you ever heard of using dry tea bags to absorb odors in shoes or gym bags ?
11800,"yeah i actually use them sometimes , it does indeed keep them very fresh and smelling good ."
11801,i'll have to try that . i'd also like to try the 5000 year old shoes that are supposed to perform better than modern shoes .
11802,yeah i wonder if anyone cracked that secret . they might work better for ballet dancers who go through 4 pairs in a week
11803,i'm sure nike is on it . wouldn't you be suspicious if russia gave you a thumb drive at the g20 summit ?
11804,yeah i guess so . did you know in 2007 an australian satire group impersonated the canadian motorcade and entered the summit ?
11805,"ha , that's funny . was it bob and doug mckenzie ?"
11806,i have no idea what their names were but do you know how they got caught ?
11807,someone was dressed like bin laden . i bet some security staff people got fired .
11808,yeah that must have been strange . do you know the nfl wide receiver steve smith ?
11809,no . i wonder if he took ballet and went through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week . some nfl players have to take ballet .
11810,he actually left his cleats in the field to raise awareness about homelessness . nice chat
11811,did you know that pianos were invented around 1700 by an italian ?
11812,"i did not , who was the person who invented them ? piano does sound italian though i suppose"
11813,he was named bartolomeo cristofori . i agree that he couldn't have picked a more italian name for his invention . can you guess who used the same piano as paul mccartney when he recorded hey jude ?
11814,i would guess it would be freddie mercury in that case ?
11815,you are right my friend . when he recorded bohemian rhapsody . two very epic songs
11816,"it sure was an epic two songs , pianos make everything better too , so melodic"
11817,"they do . i wished i played piano . i should know how , my parents had one , but i never took the time to learn it . . ."
11818,did you ever hear about the climbers who climbed a mountain and found a piano on the top ?
11819,"yes , i believe in was in 2006 in britain , not any mountain , but the highest one . how could that happen ?"
11820,"i am not sure , someone must have been playing a joke or something , use a helicopter or something"
11821,"pianos are very heavy , i have a hard time believing even an helicopter could pull something off like this , but you are right , there's no other logical explanation ."
11822,"we may never know i guess . maybe they used a private jet , like arnold schwarzenegger does"
11823,"yeah . the exgovernor of california who keep saying that environment is important , yet he commuted to work by private plane everyday ."
11824,"i guess if its 3 hours by jet , it would be a very long drive , but still , just move"
11825,exactly . you can't tell people to save the planet while you're polluting it by the worst transport mode possible . it's not like he can't afford a second home closer to work .
11826,"to each their own i guess , governors let power get to their head sometimes . like when the north dakota governor seceded from america"
11827,"some do some good though , like ralph lawrence carr who refused the internment of japaneseamericans during the second world war ."
11828,"that is an awesome thing to do , i think that is one of the darkest parts of ww2 personally"
11829,"on our side of the world , yes , but it wasn't much better in these nazi camps . . . ."
11830,"that is for sure , that is just a dark time in history , before the ease of accessing information"
11831,"hopefully , the fact that now internet allows you to chat with stranger and exchange information will prevent this from happening again . have a great day ."
11832,"that is true , it makes it a lot harder to hide injustices . thank you , you as well !"
11833,"hi , how are you ?"
11834,"good , thanks , how are you ?"
11835,"i am well , thanks . do you play any instruments ?"
11836,i used to play the piano and flute but haven't in a while . how about you ? did you know that there is a piano at the top of britain's highest mountain ? it was discovered in 2006 .
11837,"wow . who put it there ? in 1930 , the bbc had no worthy news so they just broadcast piano music . seems logical !"
11838,"hmm , i don't know if people know who put it there . no idea how it got there without people noticing . ha . there was also a piano on the airship hindenburg . it weight 356 pounds , light for a piano !"
11839,who has the strength or will to drag a piano up there ? that is light for a piano . i wounder what it sounds like ?
11840,"hmm , perhaps it was a team of people . seems like an awesome place to play though . have you heard of the song circus galop ? that song is for stress testing auto pianos . humans cannot play it ."
11841,i had no idea . im on spotify and will have to check it out . there's one piano that can crank out hits though . it was used for hey jude and bohemian rhapsody .
11842,nice ! my parents actually bribed me to take piano lessons by saying i could take horseback riding lessons as well . did you know that two high school students rode their horses to school on no vehicles day and got suspended ? haha .
11843,what ? that seems like such a great idea ! why not reward their ingenuity ?
11844,"right ? i'd really like to ride an icelandic horse . they have a fifth speed , a tolt . it's like speedwalking !"
11845,"haha ! i am picturing a speed walking horse , the the speed walkers from the olympics . with beadbands and wristbands . . ."
11846,that is a hilarious picture ! lipizzaner horses seem pretty cool too . they are born black or brown and then turn completely white after about 6 years .
11847,probably the stress from raising a family .
11848,"ha , funny . have you watched movies with clint eastwood on horseback ? apparently there are many . clint eastwood actually had a mid life allergy to horses ."
11849,"i have not . now that i thiink about it , i have not seen many clint eastwood movies . . . gran tourino may be the only one ."
11850,"yeah , they were mostly movies made a long time ago . speaking of things from history , even further before that dalmatians were associated with firefighters because they would calm and protect the horses , for the horse and carriages that firefighters used back then ."
11851,i was just wondering about that the other day . thanks for sharing that !
11852,"sure , i think dalmatians are still really cool dogs !"
11853,nice chatting with you !
11854,do you enjoy music ?
11855,"i love music , i especially enjoy classical music where the piano shines through and you can hear the relaxing sounds of the strings being struck by hammers . do you ?"
11856,"i agree , the piano is a wonderful instrument producing what is arguable the most beautiful of sounds"
11857,"lady gaga , freddie mercury all play piano but mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody that paul mccartney used to record hey jude , both amazing songs ."
11858,really ? what piano is this ? must be famous if so many amazing people used it
11859,"exactly ! though i don't think it's the same piano that was found at the top of britain's highest mountain , i'd imagine those strings and sounds would be frozen ."
11860,"in any case , you have to respect cristofori for making such a complex , yet beautifully sounding instrument so long ago in the 1700s"
11861,"is that who invented the piano , not familiar with who cristofori is ."
11862,ya bartolomeo cristofori created the acoustic piano in italy several centuries ago . i wonder how he got the idea to make such a instrument
11863,"i see , thanks for clarifying , he is a genius . i wonder how he would feel to know that some one created an aluminum grand piano to put into the lounge of a spaceship and weighs only 356 pounds !"
11864,i wonder if it being aluminum gave the piano any other special quality in regard to sound
11865,"i'm thinking it would sound like chimes , a bit more soothing perhaps it is probably just as soothing as the song composed solely by stress testing auto pianos is ."
11866,i don't think aluminum would survive the circus galop for some reason . i feel like the metal will bend
11867,"that's a good point . i was surprised to see that texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment , it would seem to me that texas was a more conservative state ."
11868,it is a shame such people didn't have more sway . there were also a person called ralph carr who was the only governor who opposed the internment of japanese americans in wwii
11869,"wow , just one person , i'd actually like to know how many people felt the same way but was afraid to speak up for fear of being criticized as 'unpatriotic' or something ."
11870,i mean being unpatriotic is being like north dakota's governor who declared martial law and seceded from the us back in 1934
11871,was the secession successful back then ? i don't recall whether or not any states actually seceded back then ?
11872,"he tried , but what matters now is that we are one country . not the us and north dakota"
11873,"i agree and that was emphasized by the beatles song ' come together ' , luckily they had so much sway and power for the public to embrace the united we stand mentality ."
11874,"i totally agree . in any case , thank you for this enjoyable chat ."
11875,are you a marvel comics fan ?
11876,"yes , i am ."
11877,i did not know that the super hero thing has been around since the 1930's . did you ?
11878,"no . i knew most of them were from comics from many years ago , but i did not know they were from the 30s . i did not know that they had kept spiderman and not all the characters . they are all so integral to marvel ."
11879,i had no idea that superheroes are registered and that there are over 300 !
11880,"me neither ! i love that marvel was able to successfully argue that mutants are not people . pretty cool information . i also love how they make up some heroes for their fans , like blueear"
11881,i have not seen all of the movies but i did see infinity war . i thought the avengers were very cool !
11882,"i have seen every single movie from marvel and some from dc . i feel like if you have not seen enough marvel movies then it is hard to connect with the characters on the level that infinity wars demanded . as the characters vanished , it broke my heart ."
11883,omg ! i bet it did ! you are a fan ! i find it interesting that lou ferrigno has been involved since the 1970s as the hulk .
11884,"yes , i am a huge fan of marvel . i was also a child when lou ferrigno had the tv series . i did not know that jarvis , the voice actor , has not seen the films . i think that is kind of disgraceful ."
11885,aww that is . i also think that i have heard interviews on npr by stan lee . i know he invented a bunch of comic book heroes for marvel .
11886,"stan lee was quite brilliant in his creation and handling of marvel . it's a shame he recently passed . i think the thing i loved most about infinity wars , avengers , and others like it , are that they had so many superheros in it at once . it gave the film so many opportunities to explore different story lines etc ."
11887,i find it fascinating that there was a series about fixing the damage caused by super heroes .
11888,"i agree , it makes sense though as they cause a lot of damage . lol i like that there was a spinoff to garfield about a superhero . that's pretty neat ."
11889,i think that is so cool . the creator of garfield went to ball state and my sister babysat for him . i like that garfield and his friends were all super heroes .
11890,"wow , that is amazing ! my cousin does comicons and makes his own costumes . he has won awards for his ironman and transformers"
11891,the fact that normal man was a reverse hero on a super hero planet is creative !
11892,i agree . i also love guardians of the galaxy . groot is my favorite . it hurt to see him disappear .
11893,i did not know that disney can not use the big marvel characters in its theme parks . i have been to the spiderman ride in universal studios .
11894,"i need to look up access , as i did not know that this character existed , so i guess i do not know about all marvel things ."
11895,i had never heard of access and they think it is to keep the two companies separate ! how confusing !
11896,i agree . funny how much legal stuff there are between them . they should just join forces .
11897,that would definitely be like disney combining with universal . i like that the marvel comics began in 1961 .
11898,me too . it's been great talking to you . have a great day .
11899,thank you !
11900,bye
11901,"hello , do you like superhero movies ?"
11902,"hello . yes , i like some superhero movies like the spiderman ones , what about you ?"
11903,i love spiderman ! infinity war was great though . spiderman was in it !
11904,cool ! did you watch antman and the wasp ? looks like is a fun movie
11905,"yes , i have seen it too . paul rudd is funny"
11906,i like how a superhero is also a dad ! ! . . reminds me of a superhero called ' normalman ' . . did yo ever hear of that ?
11907,haha . he lived with superheroes all around him . maybe he was a pet .
11908,"a superhero with no powers in a world of super heroes , that is unique ! ! did you know there are more than 300 registered superheroes in the us ?"
11909,i heard ! suprised there is not more since superhero fiction has been around since 1930
11910,wow that is a very longtime ! ! marvel started in 1939 long time too
11911,love marvel . sony could have owned it but just got spiderman alone !
11912,yes they missed the oportunity and now the superheroes are more popular than ever ! !
11913,did you know they created a hearing aid for a super hero to motivate a child to wear his ?
11914,that is so cute . . yes it was for a 4 year old boy ! !
11915,yes ! did you know garfield has a spinoff named pet force ?
11916,i did not know but i am going to search for that book series ! !
11917,me too . did you know infinity wars was shot entirely with imax ?
11918,no i did not know . . thats is cool ! 'did you know that avengers helped increase shawarma sales ?
11919,i saw that on the news haha . nice talking to you and take care
11920,"well you are right , its been nice to talk about superheroes , take care !"
11921,take care
11922,"hello how are you doing ? do you like marvel comics ? in 1998 , marvel offered the cinematic rights of almost all of its characters to sony for a mere 25 million . sony rejected the offer , and only purchased the rights to spiderman for 10 million believing that movie audiences would only care about him ."
11923,"wow , they would have made a ton of money had they taken the deal . and i am ok , thank you ."
11924,heres another fun fact ! marvel successfully argued in court that mutants are not people and thus got to pay the lower rate on xmen ' toys ' instead of the higher rate for dolls because they are not human .
11925,i guess people will argue over anything if it involves money . did you know michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics at one point ?
11926,wow of course he did lol did you know avengers : infinity war is the first film ever to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras
11927,"no i didn't know that , very interesting . i did know that it did very well at the box office ."
11928,"it was a great movie , did you see it ? the sequel is coming out this year !"
11929,no i didn't see it but i would like to . i will try and go see the sequel but not before i see the first .
11930,there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states .
11931,"i didn't know that , that is a ton ! i do know that superheroes have been around since the 30's ."
11932,me either !
11933,i also guess there are at least 30 superhero movies set to come out from 2016 and throughout 2020 .
11934,wow thats a lot lol there is actually a superhero called ' normalman . ' he was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes .
11935,"that is too funny , i know they made a blind superhero as well ."
11936,"thats definitely a super hero , super hearing ! lol marvel comics creator stan lee wrote 15 dc comics , reimagining popular superheroes like batman and superman"
11937,yeah stan lee was an awesome guy . it was sad to see him go .
11938,i know right ! i read somewhere that everytime he ended a phone call he would say ' excelsior ' lol
11939,"i think i've heard that before lol . i guess in marvel's main universe , isaac newton was once a supreme sorcerer !"
11940,"well how did he become that ? i need that on my resume , supreme sorcerer or graduated from hogwarts ."
11941,yeah that would be the best thing you could have on there lol .
11942,"right ! lol its been fun talking to you , have a good one !"
11943,"good morning to you there partner . do you like amazon ? i think bezos is a genius for creating it on july 5 , 1994 ."
11944,"hello there , i do i use it quite a bit . how about you ?"
11945,"yeah , i use it all the time ! i love how they have a deal with usps and can deliver on sunday ."
11946,"yeah i remember getting a package on sunday for the first time and thinking , hey this is ok lol ."
11947,yep it is really awesome . the amazon warehouse workers work hard and they walk between seven and 15 miles each day to for fill orders .
11948,"that is pretty crazy , i wouldn't think that a warehouse worker would walk that much ."
11949,now that's a lot of exercise . imdb has been owned by amazon . com since 1998 !
11950,"i didn't know that , very interesting , i wonder what else they all own ?"
11951,"yes me too . i know that they also have a publishing arm , a films studio , and their own electronics line ."
11952,"yeah and i think they are investing more and more into that studio part , they are starting to make some really good content ."
11953,"yes they are , they are catching up with netflix . a lot of amazon prices are matched by other competitors like best buy and target ."
11954,"yeah i heard that those guys are now price matching , i guess you have to do what you can to keep up ."
11955,exactly . and i still like those stores like target . the only state to not have a target is vermont .
11956,"that is pretty funny , i wonder why vermont ?"
11957,maybe it is just too small of a state ? target hasn't carried a tobacco product since 1996 . smokers must not like that store .
11958,"that is pretty cool actually , i heard that those herbal supplements they sell aren't all they are cracked up to be as well ."
11959,wow you are right . up to 80 percent of them don't contain the advertised herbs . scary !
11960,that is very scary ! i wonder what they all have in them then ? i would figure target wouldn't stand for that .
11961,yes agreed . not sure . but i know target sells lot of lego's ! they are very consistent with only 18 bricks out of every 1 million being defective !
11962,"wow , that is very impressive , i know my nephews love playing with legos !"
11963,yeah they are a great interactive toy and a good break from all the electronics . they are planning to search for more environmentally friendly options of making their legos ! it was so good talking to you !
11964,"yeah same here , i hope you enjoy the rest of the day !"
11965,hi . you shop on amazon ? have you heard about them putting out a toy catalogue ?
11966,"yeah i did hear about that , amazon is placing its bets on the classics and i guess they are right , classics are always better"
11967,interesting . yeah that's true . everyone gets so nostalgic and it makes them want to spend money . i remember when catalogues were popular lol !
11968,"maybe they can recover the popularity , amazon did give toys r us a hard time , its a 3 . 3 billion dollar market"
11969,"oh wow . i think amazon is a great company . so happy that jeff bezos had such a great vision on july 5 , 1994 when he founded the company !"
11970,"i agree with you there , jeff bezos is a genious , he also built this amazing clock into a mountain , its supposed to ran for 10 , 000 years"
11971,"whoa cool . the people who work at amazon are important too , and can walk between 7 and 15 miles each day ! fulfilling orders i assume ."
11972,"thats a good way to stay healthy , imdb is also a company owned by amazon"
11973,really ? they have a lot of powerful friends . the usps is also contracted with them to deliver on sunday even !
11974,"i guess they didnt want to miss on that business , the first costumer sure got a great deal , did you hear about that case ?"
11975,oh yeah you are right ! got a building named after them . all for only 27 . 95 !
11976,"i would do that , he or she got his or her order and got his or her name on a building do you also shop at targer ?"
11977,wow you are so good at being gender neutral lol . yeah i like target ! i didn't realize it was founded in minneapolis .
11978,"target will match the price of amazon ,"
11979,"that's good to know . 80 percent of herbal supplements in walmart , walgreens , target , and gnc contain none of the advertised herbs so be careful ."
11980,"oh thanks , i will be carefull , maybe not get my supplements from target or any of those places"
11981,yeah i wonder where would be a better place to buy ? well if you like target it would be best not to live in vermont ! they don't have one there !
11982,"it must be the only state , target is really popular and theres a store almost everywhere"
11983,yeah i agree . i also like the store because they don't carry tobacco products ! health conscious of them for sure .
11984,"yeah tabacco free since the year 1996 ,"
11985,good for them ! they do sell legos though ! that company is so consistent ! only 18 out of 1 million bricks are defective . nice talking with you !
11986,do you like classical music ?
11987,yes i do ! i enjoy it quite a bit . you ?
11988,"i like it as well , its been around for a while since the 6th century , a lot of history there"
11989,i did not know that . when i think classical i thnk 17 and 18 century . i wonder how it all started . royalty ?
11990,"i think music has been around almost forever but yeah i think that sounds about right , maybe with royalty it got exploited and a bit more appriciated"
11991,"i hope so . allpeople can appreciate music . i think that there is something in there for everyone , rich , poor , educated or no ."
11992,"i agree with you , you know a shopping center in australia actually uses classical music to stop teenagers from loitering i woner how that works"
11993,classical music is totally uncool dude . the kids hate it ! lol there is also the ' mosquito ' for getting rid of teenagers .
11994,"you have a great point lol , it looks like classical music also stops crime and vandalism"
11995,"yes , i bet it can be used to get rid of gangs in certain areas . maybe they could play pop music and rap and hip hop to draw them into other areas ."
11996,"in fact using classical music resulted in 33 percent fewer robberies , 25 percent less assaults , percent 37 less vandalisma and all of this in a time period of 18 months"
11997,that is an amazing statistic . i wonder if it could be broadcast all of the tough parts of chicago and la . the ensuing calm would be unreal .
11998,"maybe it can work , theres nothing to lose with trying i heard a compyter composed a piece of classic music back in 2011"
11999,"we could have ai come up with different music , figure out which is the most effective at crime prevention , blast it around the planet . presto !"
12000,"that would be a great strategy , using tetch like that and also classical music , a combination of two elements created many years appart"
12001,"yes , we can punish evildoers everywhere with classical music ! art triumphs over evil !"
12002,"sounds like a great way , do you like comedy films ?"
12003,i do like comedies a lot . i like bill murray . you ?
12004,bill murray is one of my favorite and it seems kunf fu hustle is one of his favorites
12005,"i wonder if he was being facetious about that . it is probably a great film , but could it be the greatest without him in it ? anyway , great chat !"
12006,"i liked kunf fu hustle so maybe he was being honest , and its been a great chat i agree , bye"
12007,hello . i love classical music concerts . do you ?
12008,i do . especially the opera silent night by kevin puts
12009,arthur lintgen is amazing one how he can identify a piece of classical music by simply analyzing the grooves on a vinyl record .
12010,"amazing . sadly , not many people use vinyl records anymore . speaking of classical music , did you know that heavy metal fans and classical music fans often have similar personalities ?"
12011,i did not know that . i would have love to hear the computer composed piece of contemporary classical music .
12012,i wonder if it would sound a lot more static compared to regular music . i was surprised a whole time period was named the classical period .
12013,do you like movies ? disney's ' treasure planet ' flopped but i liked it
12014,"i prefer the comedy genre while watching movies . ironically , the original green lantern film was intended to be a comedy starring jack black ."
12015,3rd rock from the sun was so funny they deserved to win awards
12016,"yes , that was a great comedy . however , i prefer the black and white ones from the 1920s ."
12017,bromantic comedies are so funny to me
12018,"since its creation in 1989 , comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows ! i cannot think of another organization that has cancelled so many ."
12019,i see how bill murray thinks kung fu hustle is ' the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy ' .
12020,did you know that mortal kombat ii was the very first game to make more than hollywood box office sales ?
12021,no i did not . the silence of the lambs came out on valentine's day in 1991 and had a box office of over 270 million . thats a crazy movie
12022,and the lord of the rings trilogy actually lost money despite their astounding performance in the box office .
12023,"demetri martin was accepted into harvard law , he should have went to finish school"
12024,"did you know that john carter failed for disney , it broke records in russia !"
12025,wow i did not know that . tom hanks is the highest alltime box office star . wow
12026,really ? i thought it would be someone like tom cruise ! classical music can be used in public spaces to deter crime .
12027,enjoy you music and movies
12028,"hi , how are you ?"
12029,"hello , i'm well ! do you have an opinion on opera ?"
12030,not really . i would probably enjoy it if i went but have no desire to go .
12031,"me neither , i think it can be boring but i would probably be interested if they did something new and untraditional ."
12032,have you been to the opera in the past ?
12033,"i have not ! but i have been interested , as i love mediums of theater that play around with changing music frequently ."
12034,"classical music concerts had loud , moving , wild audiences during the performance ."
12035,are you a fan of classical music ?
12036,i listen to barowue music a lot to help me concentrate on work or studying or reading .
12037,that's definitely a good idea . i think it gets a rep for being boring but it certainly isn't ! i had no idea paul mccartney had four classical albums .
12038,really ? i thought it was just wings . . . in 2011 a computer composed a piece of contemporary classical music .
12039,"technology is amazing with that . classical music is useful like you say too , some cities actually have used it to play in public spaces and deter crime ."
12040,"that funny , like bill murray . he hinks kung fu hustle is ' the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy ' ."
12041,"bill murray is definitely funny , one of the best hollywood successes . are you a movie fan ?"
12042,i am but dont get a chance to watch them often . you ?
12043,somewhat ! i find the box office interesting in general .
12044,disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure . can you imagine !
12045,"that is unbelievable , i can't imagine how different animation might be , considering how influential they were . are you a comedy film fan ?"
12046,i am . you ?
12047,"i am ! monty python was one of my favorite films , one of the actors , graham chapman , was actually a doctor originally ."
12048,nice chatting with you .
12049,hey did you know that disney had thought about closing down after sleeping beauty didn't make a lot of money in theaters ?
12050,"that is surprising . it may have not been a big earner , but it showed they had artistic talent . they further refined the arts and had some serious moneymakers later ."
12051,"yes , imagine the loss if they had closed that early , but they have had a lot of flops like the movie treasure planet , definitely one of the biggest flops of all time , that movie was ok but nothing special"
12052,did you know tom hanks is related to walt disney . so it runs in the family ! he is a real earner with 8 . 5 billion in box office sale .
12053,"wow didn't know that ! that's a lot of money ! bill murray is a good actor , he loves the movie kung fu hustle , have you seen it ?"
12054,"i have not . bill has had a lot of comedic success on the big screen . on the small screen , i was a big fan of 3rd rock from the sun ."
12055,"ya i guess 3rd rock won a golden globe , i've never seen that show , but it beat seinfeld and frasier which are shows that i do like"
12056,"living in a rural area , we have limited access to live arts . so , i get a lot of my performance arts from pbs . have you seen the opera ' silent night ' ?"
12057,"i haven't , i do like opera though and i like classical music , which apparently if played in public can reduce the cases of robberies and assault haha"
12058,"i suppose classical music is not a genre favored by thugs . i have been to only one classical music concert in dc . they claim audiences can be wild and moving , but my experience was that it was very quiet and subdued ."
12059,"ya it has an effect on people , in austrailia they play it in malls to stop kids from loitering too haha"
12060,i could see it drive out the mall rats ! ! ! that would make shopping a more pleasant experience . i hope the silent night opera makes it to the big screen or pbs . it is an interesting juxtaposition of an 1918 song on the 1914 ww1 armistice .
12061,"ya i'll have to check that out , what is crazy is in 2011 a computer composed a brand new classical music song , ai is getting so advanced !"
12062,"i guess ai can compose , but does it have ' soul ' and ' feeling ' ? ai is getting better , but will it every truly master human emotion ? could ai have composes silent night without have human emotion or experience ?"
12063,"that's a good question , we will have to see , i want to see the ai that can identify classical music just from vinyl records like arthur lintgen apparently can"
12064,"that is unbelievable ! i would find it hard to believe that ai could accomplish a feat such as turning silent night into an opera . even with encyclopedic knowledge of ww1 , i doubt it could capture the emotions of soldiers from three warring nations temporarily laying down their arms for christmas ."
12065,"speaking of wwi , have you seen the new peter jackson documentary on it ? it's called they will not grow old , it's actually really good he colorized old wwi footage and has interviews in it , i'd highly recommend it"
12066,i will look that up . why do you think that silent night composers wanted to commemorate armistice day that occurred more than a century ago ?
12067,"i don't know , i know that they wanted to celebrate the peace , but i can only imagine , it is crazy that wwi was over 100 years ago and everyone from that war has passed on"
12068,"i wonder myself considering the conflicts ongoing today . apparently from a reviewer's perspective the opera was not that good . but , with audiences , its a hit with shows in multiple venues ."
12069,well i will have to check that out and you should definitely check out that documentary i recommended !
12070,"i just learned that jeff bezos built a clock in a mountain , that will run for 10 , 00 years . one would think he would find something else to spend his time and money on ."
12071,i agree . i can only imagine how much he spent on that . did you see that the first amazon customer got a building named after him ?
12072,"that is so crazy ! i never knew best buy would price match amazon , i knew target did , which you cannot find in vermont ."
12073,"that's interesting ! i wonder that vermont doesn't have one . i didn't realize how target got it's start so many years ago in 1902 , originally ."
12074,i never knew that either . weird that they haven't carried tobacco products since the 90's .
12075,yes it is . apparently the herbs that are advertised to be in most of the supplements in several stores don't contain the ones they advertise .
12076,"naughty naughty . one would think these companies would take a page out of lego's book , and find environmentally friendly alternatives to oilbased plastics ."
12077,legos have been around for so long and continue to be popular . the company is actually based in denmark .
12078,yep . many think they are an american company . they've been around since 1949 . that's a long time .
12079,"i thought they were an american company too ! just since july 2015 , 600 billion lego parts have been made ."
12080,i think half of those are in my house . it's insane how amazon warehouse workers walk up to 15 miles a shift . that's hard work .
12081,they must have to be in great shape ! did you know that lego brand is considered more powerful then ferrari ?
12082,"i did , and that lego gave out a 14k gold brick to factory workers who had been there for over 25 years . that would be so cool to own ."
12083,it sure would . it sounds like the employees are taken care of well . they are valued at about 15000 . 00
12084,"have you been to one of their amusement parks ? legoland is always worth a visit , their stores are amazing , and you can buy individual bricks ."
12085,"no i haven't , but it sounds like fun ! so there are enough lego bricks for every person on earth to own 86 of them ."
12086,i bet there are at least double that in every home . especially the yard . those things are everywhere .
12087,"i know , they end up everywhere and they're are very painful to step on , ha ha ! it would be beneficial if they can produce a more environmental material to use for all those legos ."
12088,"they are working on an alternative , i was surprised to find out they had a very low defective rate in the plant ."
12089,that is surprising ! did you see where a german graffiti artist painted a bridge that's 250 sq feet to look like a lego ? that would be a sight !
12090,i did . some interior decorators are using accent pieces made of legos . mostly in white .
12091,interesting ! i enjoyed our conversation and got an education on several companies . have a great night !
12092,"thank you , you do the same ."
12093,thanks !
12094,"hi , how are youse doing tonight ?"
12095,"not bad , what do you think about amazon ?"
12096,"amazon does well by its customers , but not so good by its workers . do youse use amazon ?"
12097,"yes . i have heard their warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 miles a day , that's pretty crazy ."
12098,i guess the workers must be fit . the first customer got a building named after them . that must be a strange honor .
12099,yeah it had to have been a book because amazon started out as a online bookstore . i wonder what book the person bought ?
12100,"they probably bought jeff bezos autobiography . the man has a clock that will run for 10 , 000 years !"
12101,"haha i hope it runs better than my kindle , i had to replace one after 2 weeks but amazon sent me a new one and gave me a free book of my choice so that was nice ."
12102,that's great ! they love their customers ! i don't know about the workers though . they struck a deal with united states postal service to deliver packages on sunday
12103,"well they are certainly better than target , even though target is the 8th largest department store in the us ."
12104,and yet vermont is the only state in the usa to not have a target store . isn't that bernie sanders home state ? bernie ! what up ? !
12105,"yeah , they say they will price match amazon but i'll believe it when i see it ."
12106,i ain't never tried that ! i bet amazon will do anything to beat a competitor !
12107,well they are second in the world in total sales after the alibaba group . they are the largest internet retailer in the world by a decent margin i think .
12108,plus they own imdb . since 1998 . soon they will own everything .
12109,well it takes something special to have the usps deliver on sundays that's for sure !
12110,i think they must get time and a half or double time or something . those guys do not work on sundays !
12111,"no kidding , amazon has gotten so big now , they have their own film and television studio . i watched the jack ryan show , it was pretty good ."
12112,"that was good . i think they got a good shot at getting some awards . anyhow , great chatting with youse tonight . i wish you the best !"
12113,you too avoid target !
12114,i will ! i'll move to vermont !
12115,haha take care !
12116,"i think the classics are a sure bet , what are your thoughs on this ?"
12117,"i think the classics are a good start if it is measured . with a growing gen x income and nostalgia , the classics are a good strrt but there has to be new stuff too to create the millenials with a future ' classic ' toy they can buy too ."
12118,"i agree , there must always be innovation , its great how we have access to digital versions of book on kingle know ."
12119,yeah . i am trying to go all digital with my books but there's something about holding a book that the kindle cant replicate . do you use a kindle ?
12120,"i do use kindle , what about you ? i got a fire tablet and been using it since then ."
12121,i had a fire tablet but now use the kindle app on my ipad . i love it . i may get a white paper kindle so i can travel with it .
12122,"i think thats a great choice , i heard it has a long batterylife so thats good , kind of like the clock jeff bezos built on a mountain ."
12123,"10 , 000 years ! that's a long time . i will never know if it lasts that long . . . did you know they own the patent on oneclick shopping ?"
12124,"i didnt know that was a thing that could be patented lol , and it sure is a long time , i guess we wont be alive to see if its true ."
12125,apple pays amazon a usage fee for the technology . seems like amazon got it right . not sure how you can patent customer service but hey . . .
12126,"jeff bezos is sure talented and smart , its more than 20 years and the company seems to have no limits ."
12127,not if he buys up companies like whole foods . i heard they are looking into opening new stores in sears buildings since they closed .
12128,"i see , that would be a good way to reactivate economy , an interesting fact is how much warehouse workers have to walk ,"
12129,amazon walks like 715 . i worked in office max warehouse and walked about the same . i was so tired after my shifts .
12130,"i can imagine , 715 can be a lot but on the other side can be really healthy ."
12131,i was so disgusting after working in an unair conditioned warehouse . not fresh !
12132,"i see , that can be unhealthy on the other hand , do you ever shop at target ?"
12133,i do shop there . do you ?
12134,"i do , i like that they will match the prize that amazon has , so no doubt im getting a good deal there ."
12135,i didn't know that . that's good news ! i will shop there more often .
12136,"you should definetely with it a try , dont buy herbal supplements though as it seems like its a scam"
12137,"hi there , do you use the computer a lot ?"
12138,"i do , i spend most of my time on one each day , but not the kind that can run on water or anything cool like that ."
12139,i know we need to ask them russians how they came up with that
12140,"yeah , all the way back in 1936 too . crazy the way technology develops isn't it ?"
12141,of course . do you know why you should not smoke near an apple computer ?
12142,"i've heard it voids the warranty . i've never done it , and i'm not sure how they'd know if you did or not ."
12143,"exactly , how would they know . are you annoyed by insects ?"
12144,"all the time ! they are like the plague in florida , especially during the summer . how about you ?"
12145,i am not a fan either . have you heard of gold bugs ?
12146,"no , but they sound like the kind of buy i could possible get behind . what do they do ?"
12147,they breathe in dissolved gold and excrete solid gold
12148,i wouldn't mind having some of those around . nothing like those wasps that turn ladybugs into zombie babysitters .
12149,my goodness that is scary . do you know what clover mites are ?
12150,are they those bugs that you always find in piles of bricks ?
12151,yes and in concrete as well
12152,"i wonder if those are the same bugs that are in carmine , or red dye 4"
12153,i know they were using them in food dyes as well and it became a huge issue
12154,"the thought of eating bugs is pretty gross , but i guess its not too harmful"
12155,i am not sure if it is harmful or not but just heard about it . are you much into science ?
12156,"i enjoy it , but im definitely no einstein ."
12157,neither am i but also enjoy it too . nice chatting with you .
12158,"hi , how are you ?"
12159,i am okay . how are you ? i shop at amazon a lot . do you ?
12160,i do . i like amazon but wish i had more will power not to buy as much .
12161,it does get easy to get out of control on there . did you know that the company was founded in 1994 ? i can't believe it's been around that long .
12162,"i know , right ? did you know that bezos is getting divorced and his wife and he married one year before he started amazon so she gets half !"
12163,"yes i did hear that . i'm sure he has a hand in that not working out . i thought i heard he was unfaithful but i would have to verify that . for some reason he built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10 , 000 years . i wonder why ?"
12164,"i think he has a girl friend . the internet was abuzz about it but i wasn't interested enough to click on the stories . i would like a building named after me , like their first customer . . ."
12165,i had heard that the first customer has a building named after him . and he only spent 27 . 95 so that's a good deal .
12166,yeah ! their warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 miles a day . i used to work in a warehouse and you walk a lot !
12167,wow ! that's a huge warehouse . apparently usps has a contract with amazon to deliver their packages on sundays but i've never received a sunday delivery .
12168,i think i have but i am in chicago so that might play a role in it .
12169,i'm sure it definitely does . i'm in ohio but i love chicago . it's an amazing town . i was unaware until recently that amazon owns imdb . i go there a lot also .
12170,i do too . especially when i hear cartoon voice i recognize but can't figure out . or regular actors that i cannot place .
12171,yes i use it all of the time for the ' where i have i seen that person ' question . do you use spotify ?
12172,i do listen to spotify . all the time . you ?
12173,"i'm more of a pandora person but i do use it sometimes . it's crazy to me that an artist has to get 130 , 745 plays per day to earn minimum wage on spotify ."
12174,that's a lot of plays ! ! ! seems like the artist got the short end of the stick .
12175,"it does . but on the flip side a band once earned 20 , 000 on the app for a silent album which is mind blowing ."
12176,that is crazy ! i think spotify just went public . . .
12177,i will have to look into that . i know they have 4 million songs so they should be around for a while and you'd think the stock would be a good investment .
12178,yeah . that and amazon ! nice chatting with you !
12179,you as well .
12180,"how's it going ? did you know spiders actually fall from the sky , that's terrifying"
12181,yeah . it is like the float . scary
12182,it's crazy that spiders can parachute on long strands of webbing
12183,"i know , so creepy"
12184,i guess spiders used that method to move onto volcanic islands
12185,"that would be a lot of silk to get across the ocean , but if they float , i guess that explains it ."
12186,"yea , charles darwin claims to of caught a spider that had traveled at least 60 miles"
12187,how would he have known ?
12188,apparently he was on a newly formed volcanic island and was able to identify the spider as an aeronaut spider which are found far away from there
12189,ahh . i dont know why so many people are afraid of them .
12190,i don't know but much can be learned about how they travel through the air which can lead to innovations in engineering
12191,i didn't think of that . that would be a neat thing to study .
12192,"yea , spiders and insects can be pretty cool . spiders aren't the only ones who travel in the sky , ladybugs do too"
12193,"there are gold bugs , that breathe in dissolved gold and excrete solid gold ."
12194,"thats awesome , i wonder if there is any places that have the gold bugs on display , i'd love to see them"
12195,id like to own a few . maybe make some extra money from the gold the excrete .
12196,"theres a wasp that turns ladybugs into zombie babysitters , too bad they can't change them to gold"
12197,yeah . there is a bug that ends up in red dye 4
12198,"yea and theres bugs in carmine and cochineal extract , at least it's extra protein"
12199,thats a good way of thinking of it . lol
12200,"well i got to go , nice talking with you"
12201,how's it going ? are you into computers much ? they are used in a lot of things such as controlling systems and industrial and consumer devices
12202,"i'm using computer right now , actually . it's crazy that they have such wide range of uses these daysit seems like they can do pretty much anything humans can ! no wonder people are trying to upload their minds to them ."
12203,"yea computers are interesting , in 1936 russia invented one that ran off water"
12204,"yes , they can consist of materials other than the metals and rare earth elements we're used to , someone even built one virtually in minecraft !"
12205,"that's crazy , so is apple voiding warranties for smoking near their computers"
12206,"yes , humans can have weird rules , but there must be some scientific reasoning behind it . i mean , that's how we got computers and the internet in the first placescientists ."
12207,"yea , the world wide web was invented by an english scientist working at cern"
12208,"yes , the internet was originally for sharing research data . the idea of a scientist is a pretty recent ideait wasn't a term until the 19th century when williams whewell invented it in 1833 ."
12209,"that's interesting , plus scientists tend to be really smart at a young age . von neumann could divide two 8 digit number in his head at 6"
12210,smart people tend to stay that way and remain curious throughout their lives . the emperor of japan is trained as a scientist and continues to publish research today .
12211,"that's awesome , i wonder what emperor akihito studies ?"
12212,"it would be neat if he studied something that isn't theoretical , like insects ."
12213,"yea insects are pretty cool , there are gold bugs in the ocean that breath gold"
12214,that seems wasteful haha . i guess that kind of unusual use of resources is to be expected when they make up over 90 percent of animal life on earth !
12215,"yea plus they transport themselves through the sky , that's crazy and a little scary"
12216,"i don't think they have the mental capacity to be scaredi mean , they can even end up as zombies like ladybugs who are infected by dinocampus coccinellae wasps ."
12217,"that's pretty scary , so is eating crushed up bugs with food that contains red 4"
12218,"yes , and those bugs that actually look red that we see on concrete are called clover mites , which seems kind of ironic ."
12219,it's crazy how bugs are found everywhere including oceans
12220,"yes , even though crustaceans are the dominant life form there ."
12221,well both crustaceans and insects are arthropods
12222,"yes , they are ."
12223,hi how are you ? do you like computers ?
12224,"hello there , i do like computers , they are very useful . how about you ?"
12225,"i love computers . they are my best friends . almost . i spend too much time with them . did you know that in 1936 , the russians made a computer that ran on water ?"
12226,"holy cow that is impressive , i wonder what that would look like ?"
12227,i cant imagine that it went very fast though . probably an interesting design .
12228,yeah sounds like it would be . do you know how much ram the space shuttle's general computer runs on ?
12229,the shuttle is pretty old technology . 100k ? 500 ?
12230,i guess 1mb of ram . i don't think that is very much at all !
12231,"that is not much , but i bet the programmers were efficient about memory usage . not like the oss of today ."
12232,yeah that is most likely true . did you know that smoking around apple computers voids the warranty ?
12233,"that is strange , but i guess it could hurt the electronics . what about vaping though ? is that ok ?"
12234,"that i could't tell you , but i can say that most people probably never knew that about the smoking ."
12235,that is true . smoking ? it is not that uncommon . especially in europe and south america and japan and china .
12236,"yeah i bet , on a different note , do you know much about insects ?"
12237,i dont know much about insects . they have six legs . spiders have eight .
12238,"that is true , there are some crazy bugs like gold bugs that can breath in dissolved gold and excrete solid gold !"
12239,really ? i have never seen that ! i heard the gold bug was a story by poe . it can find gold .
12240,yeah that bug sounds crazy . do you know what those tiny red bugs that usually are on concrete are called ?
12241,ladybugs ? ladybirds ? is that what you mean ? red with black spots ?
12242,"no those tiny tiny ones , i guess they are called clover mites ."
12243,"oh , ok . what about them ? what are clover mites ?"
12244,"i just never knew what they were called . but it's been good talking with you , i hope you have a good day !"
12245,good morning ! how are you ?
12246,im great how are you ?
12247,i'm great as well ! do you have amazon prime ?
12248,"no i dont . what is it , exactly ?"
12249,it's an electronic commerce and cloud computing company based in seattle .
12250,amazon prime ? i know what amazon is .
12251,"it's there ecommerce portion of their company though but also a place you can rent movies and shows , etc . if you know what amazon is you know what prime is lol ."
12252,"oh , ok . i guess i have seen the name , but i usually just buy stuff from amazon . i dont watch shows there . do you have it ?"
12253,i do . do you have spotify ?
12254,"i do not use spotify . thats a music service , right ?"
12255,"that is , i dont either . i can't believe it has 4 million songs that still has yet to be played !"
12256,i guess people hope to get discovered on spotify ? i wonder how many people actually make it after spotify .
12257,"that's a good question ! i know a musician needs to get 130 , 745 plays per day just to earn a minimum wage !"
12258,that is insane . i wonder how many visitors per day there are . not enough to make a living .
12259,that is definitely something to look into . were you ever a fan of michael jordan ?
12260,i liked mj . he was an exciting player . made big plays .
12261,he really was ! do you know how michael jordan ruined muggsy bogues' career ?
12262,"how did he do that ? i know that muggsy was tiny , but a great player ."
12263,"from what i read before , he said ' shoot it you midget ' . that's harsh . anyways , great chatting with you !"
12264,"yeah , that is harsh . and not really sportsmanlike . yes , i enjoyed chatting . have a good day ."
12265,thanks you too !
12266,do you like video games ? i have a playstation 4 an i am exited to buy ' ananmorphine ' its a game that shows a lot of promise .
12267,i have one and but haven't heard of that game . i like watching horror films tape steven king .
12268,"it looks pretty good , one of the main attractions of the game is that you can manipulate time , space and memory . i like steven king as well !"
12269,did you know watching horror movies can burn up to 180 calories .
12270,"i want to lose some weight i didnt know it was that easy lol , have you seen the movie ' the shinning ' ?"
12271,i did i heard the boy danny didnt know he was acting in a horror films until several years later .
12272,i heard that too ! that movie is scary i wonder how they managed to trick him .
12273,probably young and niave . stephen king thought bambi was a horror movie .
12274,"thats funny lol , i don't see bambi as a horror movie but we all have our perceptions . there is an instrument called water phone , its used in many horror movies ."
12275,yes to make the creepy metallic noises
12276,"yeah to think horror films were inspired by authors such as edgar allan poe , mary shelley ."
12277,do you play any instruments ? i like the violin .
12278,"i like the guitar but think the violin is a cool instrument as well , i like that it has a small size ."
12279,modern violins were preferred over million dollar stradivarius violins when tested on the blind
12280,"i wonder why that is , interesting fact indeed , did you know there is a violin that is made out of stone ! it must be heavy and hard to play ."
12281,that is cool . albert einstein played the violin
12282,"he did ? wow , i bet he was a skilled player after all he was a genius ."
12283,yes he played the piano too .
12284,i've always wanted to learn to play the piano but i spent my early years busy playing playstation . it's crazy how they built a supercomputer using a bunch of used playstation 3s .
12285,play station was made in japan right ?
12286,"thats right , its abbreviated as ps and it was created by sony ."
12287,hey what do you thnk of the game anamorphine ?
12288,i haven't tried it myself . have you ?
12289,"no i haven't played it yet . but it sounds very interesting . i like the designer , hideo kojima . he is really awesome and made the metal gear solid games"
12290,"yeah , i'm glad he's able to still work considering what happened to him . have you played a lot of play station games in the past ?"
12291,"i did used to play a lot of video games . i haven't played them anymore though . i love metal gear solid , what about you ? that was for the original playstation"
12292,"yeah i played a lot of playstation . i use to own an original and had a demo for metal gear solid but never had the game . i eventually got a ps2 and played a lot on that , i've owned a ps3 for some time but moved onto pc gaming . was metal gear your favorite ps1 game ?"
12293,yes it would be that and also final fantasy 7 . i remember when they came out with the dualshock as a new controller . that was one of my favorite controllers of all time
12294,i loved the old ps1 controllers . you ever play a game called legend of dragoon ?
12295,"i have heard of that game . i think it was published by sony , i heard it was good but never played it , what did you think about it ?"
12296,"i really enjoyed it . i got to borrow it back in the early 2000s but managed to get a copy a few years ago . i really enjoy the combat system but the game itself can get a bit repetitive . it's a long game though , on four disc !"
12297,that is long game ! i missed games that had multiple discs . i think it's cool that the grand theft auto game for playstation could play music if you put it in a cd player though
12298,"i didn't know that ! i knew the original ps1 could play music , i use to play"
12299,did you know that the us dod bought 1800 playstation 3s ? they wanted to build a super computer and it was cheaper than actually doing any alternative methods for that
12300,that's crazy . i think i remember hearing about something like that before . i also know that it was used to research black holes . it was defiantly one of the more advance consoles compared to the level of technology at the time .
12301,yep i agree . i didn't like how they got rid of linux on the playstation 3 though . it's funny that a company executive actually tweeted the unlock code for the playstation 3 . talk about a mess up haha
12302,yeah it can happen . did you know that they actually made an official linux kit for the ps2 ? when i found out i thought it was crazy to think a company would support something like that so officially . usually consoles are very closed systems .
12303,"yes i agree . and that's why they close down the linux access , because people were hacking it lol . they just didn't think that stuff out very well . i think it is cool that the last game for the ps2 was fifa 14 , which spanned 3 console generations"
12304,it's wild to think of how long a systems lifespan can reach . i remember hearing that someone made a nes game and got it supported through donations and even released a physical copy .
12305,"that is really cool ! i actually stopped playing a lot of games and i played a piano or now . because i think it is more useful to play an instrument , do you play the violin by the way ?"
12306,i don't really play any instruments . i mostly work and spend time outside when i can . i enjoy video games when it's either way too cold or the weathers really bad . are you looking for a violin player ?
12307,"no but i thought about starting to play . someone actually made a violin out of stone , which i would be interested in buying"
12308,horror film seeks to fear . many fans are for horror films .
12309,i love horror films . did you know stephen king was afraid of bambi when he was younger ?
12310,it was interesting watching horror movies can burn up more than 180 calories .
12311,"wow , i guess that's a good way to lose some weight ."
12312,horror film may also have supernatural fiction and thriller genres .
12313,very cool . i saw that watching horror films before viewing abstract art can make you enjoy the art more .
12314,waterphone is used to make creepy metallic noises in horror movies . the cost of movie is very low is compared with other film .
12315,very cool to know . i heard the boy from the shining didn't even know it was a horror film until several years later .
12316,it is very interesting . while watching make more thriller .
12317,do you like the violin ?
12318,"yes , it is a wooden instrument . the body of violin is made up of wooden body ."
12319,there is actually a violin made out of stone that is fully playable .
12320,"it is very interesting . albert einstein was also a gifted musician , playing the violin with exceptional skill ."
12321,modern violins were preferred over milliondollar violins when the sound tests were blind .
12322,do you have playstation ?
12323,i do . i have a ps4 . what about you ?
12324,classic sony .
12325,very cool . the us department of defense used 1760 playstation 3's to build a supercomputer .
12326,"the playstation 2 is the bestselling home console to date , having reached over 155 millions ."
12327,i agree . i love all playstation consoles .
12328,playstation mobile is a software framework that provides playstation content on mobile devices
12329,"yep they have . well , it was good chatting with you . have a great day !"
12330,hey have you played the game anamorphine ?
12331,no i haven't have you ?
12332,"no i haven't played it yet , but i want to , it is apparently being built by hideo kojima who created the metal gear series"
12333,i was reading through the summary and it sounds complicated .
12334,"it sounds very indepth , but i am excited for the game . do you like horror movies by the way ? i think this is going to be like a horror video game"
12335,yes i do like horror films . did you ever see the exorcist ?
12336,"yes that's one of my favorite ones , i also like stephen king horror movies like the shining , have you seen that movie ?"
12337,oh yeah that was great . jack nicholson was at his best in that film .
12338,yep i agree . what do you think about danny in that movie ? he was only a kid but luckily he didn't realize he was making a very violent horror movie at the time lol
12339,he did a good job . i didn't know he didn't realize it was a horror film . apparently no one in the exorcist felt that were making a horror film either .
12340,"well that's good because that would have messed up that little girl in that movie too , what do you think about stephen king movies ? did you know that he thinks that bambi should be considered a horror movie"
12341,"no i didn't know that . what can i say about stephen king , he is definitely the king ."
12342,"haha i agree with you . i also like horror movies because they can burn calories when you watch them , up to 180 per movie"
12343,i could see where that could happen . i'm trying to think of the king movie where kathy bates breaks the guys leg with a sledge hammer . that just wrenches my gut .
12344,"yeah i think that movie was called misery , and i was in misery as i watched it lol . have you ever heard of the instrument called the water phone by the way ?"
12345,"that's it misery , thanks . no , what is a water phone ?"
12346,"it's an instrument that horror movies used to create that creepy metallic sound , it makes you feel scared when you hear it"
12347,that's interesting . i think it is really interesting how they used to create different sound effects without the electronics they use today .
12348,yeah i agree with you . have you ever played an instrument before ? for instance the violin ?
12349,"no , i played the trumpet mostly but never a string instrument , you ?"
12350,"i never play the violin , i played myself , i do want to see a violin made out of stone which apparently exists though"
12351,"hi , do you ever listen to audio books ? i get a ton of them from the library here ."
12352,"yes , i have a ton of audiobooks . i have the harry potter series on audobook !"
12353,me too ! it's interesting that audiobooks were originally just so that blind people could ' read ' books but i think they are great for everyone . especially when on the go .
12354,"it's awesome listening to some of these artists narrating audiobooks . audiobook is something of the future , before that was ebooks . i feel sorry for barnes and noble ."
12355,"they can still sell ebooks if they make the retail experience worth going to . michael jackson made an audio book for et , it's pretty cool ."
12356,"well , audiobooks were originally made for blind people . however , with advent of vehicles and mindless driving , listening to audiobooks are easy ."
12357,"yeah , even just at home it's nice too . reading paper literature is nice either artistic stories or intellectual information , but it can be a strain on your eyes ."
12358,"however , it's quicker to read a book than it is to listen to it . you can also take notes , i love postit notes . scifi books are great when i'm about to hit the hay . i love to read fantasy books ."
12359,"that is true , but i'm rarely in a rush . take harry potter which you've mentioned . it's probably the greatest fantasy book and the audio books are even better . jim dale performs 300 different voices , and he certainly sounds better then i do in my head ."
12360,"yep . there's a janitor from chicago who wrote a 15 , 145 page fantasy manuscript and spent over 6 years writing it ."
12361,wow ! and i thought the harry potter books were long . what was it called ? i'd imagine that would take a long time to read .
12362,"the author was henry darger . it was ' the story of the vivian girls ' . i personally never read it , but i heard about it . if you have time , you should read it !"
12363,"i'm not sure i do , but i'll put it on my list of things to read . i'm just about to start reading some dungeons and dragons books . by read of course i mean listen to audio books . lots of famous people narrated them ."
12364,who is your favorite narrator for audiobooks ? weird al ? felicia day ? wil wheaton ?
12365,"that's a tough one to answer . i guess weird al , but icet is surprisingly good too ."
12366,i can't get past icet as a rapper and tv celebrity . audiobook narration by him just makes me think about all the stuff he played in .
12367,"i can see that , but he does such a good job . i hear he's really into spelling bee's too among other things . did you know there are fantasy drafts for the national spelling bee ? i bet t is into that ."
12368,lol . fantasy drafts of national spelling bees ? i could see that . such a baller .
12369,people will bet on anything . i prefer fantasy baseball .
12370,i wasn't aware you can bet on fantasy baseball . . did you make any bets on the superbowl ?
12371,"no , not into football . maybe next year though . i think i'm going to head out now . i'm actually going to go to the book store so maybe i'll see if that have that 15 , 145 page book . i bet it will be heavy ."
12372,"listen to the audiobook version , if they have it !"
12373,i'll check for that first ! have a good day .
12374,have a good day too !
12375,bye
12376,there is a fantasy draft of the spelling bee ? wow
12377,i did not know it before .
12378,"i don't know if that means they bet actual money , but people will bet on anything"
12379,i know terry pratchess was knighted for being a good comedic fantasy author .
12380,"i've never heard of him , i'm not a big fantasy person"
12381,"also , i heard that a janitor wrote a fantasy manuscript totaling 15 , 145 pages ."
12382,i thought that was kind of sad . i wonder if it was actually published
12383,"it was only found out after his death . so , he earned nothing ."
12384,"well , maybe he never wanted it published and just did if for himself"
12385,are you interested in literature in general ?
12386,"i'm a big reader in general , but my tastes probably aren't as highbrow as they should be . do you like to read ?"
12387,i used to but i have been busy lately with family and work . i did not know that literature was considered to be an aft form . do you ?
12388,"i suppose its an art form , i certainly didn't know it was an olympic event until 1952"
12389,i heard that it was an olympic event from year 1912 to 1952 . i wonder how it worked .
12390,i'm going to have to look up more about the fda burning literature in an act of censorship . that's pretty horrific to happen here
12391,i should research more myself . i wonder why the literature was censored .
12392,"depends on the era i suppose . i'm hoping it was some time ago , but you never know"
12393,"i just found out that music , sculpture and painting were also included in olympic from 1912 until 1952 . why did they decide to stop ?"
12394,probably not very entertaining to watch on tv !
12395,there was no tv though during that period ? am i wrong ?
12396,tv was around in the 50's i'm sure . i love lucy was on then
12397,"oh , ok . i like to listed to audiobooks when i drive . do you like audio books"
12398,"no , they put me to sleep"
12399,"barbara brooks wallace who wrote ' peppermints in the parlor ' died nov 27 in arlington , va at the age of 95 ."
12400,"she was a amazing writer , i have heard she wrote some of the best young readers books mixed with mystery and adventure that the world has ever seen"
12401,the book peppermints says it is an amusing gothic romp and became an audiobook recorded by angela lansbury
12402,i have never heard the audio version i might have to get it . i do know it takes place in the 20th century in san fransisco .
12403,she also wrote other mysteries that won edgar awards from the mystery writers of america
12404,yes she won several awards . she wrote another great book called ghost in the gallery . have you heard of it ?
12405,not before today . she was actually born in china and her father had been a silentfilm actor who moved to new york
12406,yes that happened amid the russian revoltution if i recall
12407,her mother moved to china during the russian revolution from russia and was a nurse
12408,o that is right i forgot about that . i recall that the trouble with miss switch a early work was turned into a sort of animated program at one point .
12409,she graduated college in 1945 from the university of california at l . a . and then lived in a boardinghouse in sanfran
12410,yes she traveled a lot and has seen more of the world than most will in their lives .
12411,"i like that she stated that she didn't know how the story would end until she got to the end of writing the book . however , she knew that the books would always be for children and would have a happy ending because she got to choose !"
12412,yeah she really was ahead of her time . i remember reading the barrel in the basement it was one of her first fantasy books . it is a great book for young readers still today
12413,"speaking of fantasy books , did you know that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy ?"
12414,i had no clue but that is fascinating . i have heard that people fantasy draft the national spelling bee if you could believe such
12415,what does that mean ?
12416,they pick students kinda like how a nfl coach picks players .
12417,"really , how do they know the prospects ? did you know that the fda burned six tons of literature in an act of censorship ?"
12418,"i think they just do it for fun since its not that exciting , and i have heard of that before and its awful ."
12419,audiobooks which i love were started as a project to make books for the blind .
12420,i dont listen to many . i prefer to read my literature . i guess you can call me old fashinoed .
12421,"both are great , but when in the car driving a good audiobook goes far for the family : , i didn't know it but michael jackson released an audiobook or soundtrack album directed by spielberg"
12422,hello ! are you a fan of literature ?
12423,"yes , especially anything to do with fantasy or mystery . what about you ?"
12424,i am into nonfiction and history . what is your favorite book ?
12425,i really liked hawaii by michener . i haven't had much time to read much nonfiction unless you count recipe books . which do you like best ?
12426,i don't really have a favorite honestly . i can't believe the fda was against literature back in the day .
12427,people can have some interesting ideas . i head there is a dr . in texas that teaches a heavy metal literature class . what do you think it covers ?
12428,that is very interesting . it probably covers some good music for sure ! i feel like many students have neck strains from head banging lol .
12429,i wonder if you get extra credit if you start growing your hair out for that class ? lol i had a mythology and fantasy class in college . it was pretty good .
12430,i'm sure that was interesting too ! did they teach you about the fantasy congress that exists ?
12431,"no , but maybe their kids are in the fantasy spelling bee ! i saw the artwork of that chicago janitor who died and only then was his work discovered . it's very unique !"
12432,oh really ? that would be neat to see . i would love to see the fantasy draft go on with the spelling bee haha .
12433,"henry darger is his name , you should look at it ! i think a fantasy wall street might be interesting . especially if you could learn to participate in the real stock market !"
12434,that blows my mind what is out there and what people put money into haha . he should do a fantasy draft for the annual literature contest where writers put the worst possible opening sentence to a novel .
12435,i've been interested in trying out an audiobook . have you ever ? i am worried i might not like the voice that's used for it .
12436,i haven't either and worry about it too . maybe look for jim dale to narrate for you !
12437,"i hear steven spielberg directed and audiobook or soundtrack for et that was released by michael jackson . i bet it's good ! i think audiobooks have been around for a long time , right ?"
12438,oh i'm sure they have been around since the 1930's in music shops !
12439,i remember as a kid we had some at school that were on the old time records . my favorite audiobook was the teddy bears picnic . i played it over and over to my parent's dismay !
12440,i bet they really enjoyed it too haha . they started out as a project to make books for the blind !
12441,that's excellent ! kids really like audiobooks . . . i remember having those choose an ending books but never the talking books . i wish they'd make those !
12442,those were really the best . well it was nice chatting with you have a great night !
12443,snakes always intrigue and scare me . i did not know that they were considered carnivorous reptiles .
12444,"yea snakes are scary . they get the reputation on representing human life activity like war , murder , greed , jealousy , and revenge ."
12445,you are right . their jaws are highly mobile that they can swallow preys larger than themselves .
12446,so would a past viking have the thoughts of a snake . always wanting to swallow up the world with total domination ?
12447,"yes , i read about that . are you familiar with viking dark ages ? i'm interested to hear further about it ."
12448,i know that they had norse gods that were before jesus christ . i'm still in the awakening of knowing more about them .
12449,could you tell me more about it ? are vikings good pirates ?
12450,yes they are masters of the waters wanting to destroy anyone or anything that opposes them . so what is your thoughts on snakes because you have spoken little about them ?
12451,are crocodiles related to snakes ?
12452,"no , they are more related to birds than snakes . truly you understand that snakes are reptilian however crocodiles have a hard structure not a smooth body like lizards and and snakes"
12453,thank you for your info . i heard of flying snakes . do or did they exist on earth ?
12454,it was a written work however i never seen one in the 35 years of my life .
12455,oh okay . do you know that there is no snake in new zealand ? i thought that snakes could be found anywhere .
12456,again that is literature and to find out for yourself is the absolute truth . you should take a trip to new zealand and prove all scholars wrong .
12457,perhaps someday or i should research more about it .
12458,yes there is a long history of snakes so you have your work cut out for you .
12459,thank you . would you like to chat about something else ?
12460,what is your thoughts about writing poetry ? do you think you should write it when your depressed or when your inspired ?
12461,perhaps you are more creative when you are depressed ? what do you think ? is poetry part of literature ?
12462,"no , because literature is more formal while poetry comes more from the soul ."
12463,you are so knowledgeable . i learned a lot from you .
12464,believe me there is something in you that is great . please do not ignore it or in the future you will regret it . make your happiness in your work . make your work your poetry so it never is work again rather it is your soul talking to the universe .
12465,"again , thank you so very much . it was nice chatting with you ."
12466,"excellent , likewise and good luck with your christmas ."
12467,you too
12468,what entertainment do you enjoy ?
12469,i like to read sometimes . there's a course at west texas aandm that teaches heavy metal lol
12470,what literature do you enjoy ?
12471,"i like to read the old roman and greek myths , i found them interesting plus they never had romantic subplots in them"
12472,like the iliad or odyssey ?
12473,yea those were good although i'm not a huge poetry fan . apparently poetry has been around since the prehistoric times in africa
12474,i think poetry is a hit or miss . have you heard of a palindrome ?
12475,"yea , i'm vaguely familiar with it , i'm just glad i don't have to write one"
12476,i can't even begin to comprehend how demetri wrote a 224 word palindrome and how it would even go
12477,i feel anxious just thinking about it . there's a poem consiting of 800 irregularly prounced words that is 274 lines long
12478,"one thing i find inspiring is that there is a poem that if read normally is depressing , but backwards is inspiring"
12479,"that does sound awesome . it's interesting how popular poetry is , the vikings considered poetry as a gift from odin"
12480,"despite quality , the authors don't necessarily get paid much . edgar allan poe only received 9 bucks for the raven"
12481,yea i heard poe died without much money . tupac studied poetry in high school in baltimore as a teen
12482,literature is kinda like art . many people are only appreciated after their passing
12483,"funny thing is that art , music , and poetry were once olympic sports so it was appreciated more in the past"
12484,"fair point . on a side note , do you have any pets ?"
12485,"i do have a pet snake , non venomous though , although it would be pretty cool to have antivenom blood like that guy who was bitten so many times"
12486,"well i guess you could also sell the venom to help save lives . however , milking snakes are extremely dangerous"
12487,"yea , i'm just glad i don't live in australia where venomous snakes outnumber nonvenomous snaks"
12488,"indeed . in any case , thanks for chatting ."
12489,"hi , how are you ?"
12490,"fine , and you ? do you like snakes ?"
12491,"um , not really much of a snake person . you ?"
12492,"i had a pet corn snake once , but it died overwinter because my house was too cold . i see a lot of them around here when my cats catch them ."
12493,i guess you don't live in new zealand then . there are no snakes in nz
12494,interesting . i knew there weren't any in ireland or hawaii .
12495,the fear of snakes is hardwired not only in human brains but also in monkey brains . were you ever afraid of your corn snake ?
12496,"no , i've never been afraid of snakes i mean , i'm afraid of them intellectually if i know they're venomous , but i enjoy handling them . are you afraid of them ?"
12497,"generally , i have a healthy respect for them . thanks for using the word venomous . many people say poisonous , but that's for things we eat , or shouldn't eat ,"
12498,"i don't think i've ever seen a venomous one , except at zoos and the like . i see a lot of black snakes and grass snakes here , and they're handy for keeping down rodents that bother my garden ."
12499,there is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey . have you ever seen any of these ? sounds terrifying .
12500,i never heard of them before . i wonder if they just use their muscles to launch themselves from against the ground ?
12501,"i only care if they're venomous ! and if they're out bothering my garden . the organs in a snake can be one in front of the other , instead of side by side . makes sense ."
12502,i used to have a dog who was terrified when i pulled the garden through the grass lol .
12503,i'm sorry ? pulled the garden through the grass ? sounds rather poetic ! are you a poet ?
12504,"nah , i meant pulled the garden hose headdesk . but snakes are actually good for gardens they eat the rodents that feed on green stuff ."
12505,"i don't hate snakes , i just have a wariness around them . i stay away from them , they stay away from me . they can eat all the rodents they want . they can have my share ."
12506,"my cats love torturing them , unfortunately ."
12507,"i have similar attitudes toward cats as snakes . i am indifferent . cats look at me , i look at them . i will scratch their heads and feed them if they do the same for me ."
12508,i like them a lot i think we have similar temperaments .
12509,"a good match then ! well , i enjoyed chatting with you !"
12510,same !
12511,"hi there ! looking forward to chat with you ! ; ,"
12512,"hello , you as well ! do you know anyone who has a snake as a pet ?"
12513,"personally i don't , but after we saw one in a pet store , my son wants one ever since because his friend has one and he saw it when he was feeding him with mice . . . do you know anybody like that ?"
12514,"wow ! yes , i have a friend who has 3 snakes ! i don't think i could personally ever have one as a pet , but people sure do love them . i can't believe that their organs appear in front of eachother and not side by side ."
12515,"interesting . . . i remember how excited my son was when he saw it eat the mouse ; , we had a lovely talk after that i needed to put some light on this event to my son ; , lol"
12516,"oh boy , that must have been an interesting talk . i'm not sure how i would have even went about it ! lol . speaking of snakes is making me think of the story about medusa ."
12517,medusa . . . medusa . . . that chick who was turning in stone anybody who looked in her eyes ?
12518,"i'm not quite sure , but all i know is that she had snakes as hair . . . literature sure was interesting back in the day !"
12519,"yeah that was a cool story somebody defeat her by bringing mirror as a shield . we were always joking with my friends when we were young boys that she had to be really ugly if people were turning into stone after looking at her ; , lol"
12520,that's so funny ! i would feel horrible if that were me ! i would want to just hide all of the time lol
12521,". . . and she kind of did ! in a cave or something , but there was an artifact that she was guarding or something like that and everybody wanted to steal that from her : , poor guys ; , lol"
12522,"hahaha oh man , she had a tough life . do you have any favorite literature or poems ?"
12523,"probably horrors and scifi i've just finished necroskope , brian lumbley , and i think i'm going to read ' the witcher ' for the third time ; , lol , how about you ?"
12524,"that sounds really interesting . lately i have been into horror and mystery . i am more into poetry , but i really like stephen king ."
12525,i love stephen king ! i loved ' the stand ' and ' it ' how about you ? do you have a favorite one ?
12526,' it ' is a great one ! what did you think of the remake ?
12527,i was so skeptical as this is my favorite movie of all times and i was afraid they will ruin it . . . but i went to movie theaters and i must say they did a terrific job ! did you see it ?
12528,"awesome . i've seen bits and pieces on tv , but there was one scene that made me turn off the tv ! there was just so much blood . . . , it was a bathroom scene ,"
12529,are you talking about the bathroom scene from the original movie or from the new one ?
12530,the new one
12531,"yes , that was a good scene , but i prefer the one with geargie in the beginning : , also a little bloody ; ,"
12532,wow ! it was fun speaking to you ! now i want to go watch a scary movie : p
12533,"hey how are you , did you watch the incredibles 2 by chance , any good ?"
12534,"yes , i did watch that movie , its was really good . i cant believe we have waited 13 years for it to come out !"
12535,"i know , i haven't seen either , were they both pretty good ? which one did you like more ?"
12536,"hard to say , i think i liked the first one better , but they were both really good . i didnt even realize that the movie is based in 1960 lol thats funny , they have so much technology in the movie . in the sequel we finally see the baby's powers ."
12537,"oh really ? i would have never have guessed that , i guess 13 years doesn't seem too long then ?"
12538,do you like any disney movies ?
12539,"i do , i really liked the lion king , it was the first disney movie to be translated to zulu for an african release ."
12540,oh yeah that was a good one ! great music as well . have you seen they are doing a live action movie of aladdin ? the cartoon was so good .
12541,"i saw that , the blue will smith ? lol , that'll be good . they're definitely not recycling their animation frames like they did in the 70s ."
12542,"lol yeah , robin williams was the perfect genie though !"
12543,"for sure , rip robin williams , it's unfortunate he gets so much flack , he must have felt so much pain in his life that it was that unbearable ."
12544,"i know , its so sad . it seems common in comedians . you never know what they are really going through because they cover it up with jokes and stuff ."
12545,"for sure , it is really sad . it's terrible then when people just go after them and hate on them when they've never lived a day in their shoes ."
12546,"exactly , you cant judge , you just never know ."
12547,"for sure , could you imagine watching wreck it ralph in the 1980s though ? that's when they started developing that movie ."
12548,"that wouldve been amazing honestly , i really like that movie . hard to believe they started developing it then ."
12549,"for sure , what was the movie about ? that's some vision to start that in the 1980s ."
12550,"it was about a video arcade and at night the characters would be able to leave their game and socialize in the circuit . but of course , there a few characters that try and cross over to other games for various reasons and things get crazy ."
12551,"oh wow , i think i should go see that . i saw it on fortnite , so it's kind of like toy story ?"
12552,"kinda like toy story , its really creative . the second one was not as good ."
12553,"oh dang , i never knew there was a second one out yet . i'll check them out , thanks for the recommendation . i am going to take off though , great chatting and have a good rest of the night !"
12554,hello . ' incredibles 2 ' sounds like a lot of fun . what do you think ?
12555,i only saw the first one but i know that they are set in the 1960's which is interesting .
12556,"that would be interesting to me , since i was a college kid in the 60s . it'd be fun to check out the cars , hairstyles , clothes , etc ."
12557,i'm sure . i did hear that 13 years before the sequel came out there was a video game form of a sequel .
12558,did you play that video game ? i wonder how it compared to the movie . is the aim to knock off the underminer ?
12559,i did not . i don't know much about it apart from it exists . do you enjoy disney films ?
12560,"oh sure . the original disney walt was a genius . the company has an amazing record of films , animated and not ."
12561,they definitely do . did you know that the lion king was the first disney film translated into zulu ?
12562,"really ? that's quite interesting ! i guess that would be appropriate since the lion king , which i love , is african ."
12563,it does seem appropriate . apparently in the 70's the company recycled a lot of frames so you will see the same ones in other movies .
12564,"i guess there's a lot to be said about recycling , then . anyhow , i'd like to take my stepgrandsons to see the incredibles 2 . they'd enjoy it ."
12565,i'm sure they would . did you take them to see frozen ?
12566,"no , their mom did . i saw frozen on tv . i liked it . i guess some kids see it over and over ."
12567,yes they do . it was so popular . that's good because it was the first animated disney film directed by a woman .
12568,glad to hear that . hollywood doesn't have a great record of women directing films .
12569,i agree . hopefully a shift is happening soon . disney makes a lot on merchandise . the toy industry gets involved before they even begin filming a production .
12570,"i suppose if anything would be hand in glove , it would be toys and popular movies for kids ."
12571,"most definitely . off topic , but do you find birds interesting ?"
12572,"yes . i live in the sticks in kansas and am greatly cheered to see a bald eagle every once in a while . they are incredibly graceful , even kind of awesome ."
12573,they are . did you know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs ?
12574,"those rascals ! well , maybe the hummingbirds find the designs attractive and just can't help it ."
12575,ha ha . they do it to repair their nests which is quite smart .
12576,"hello there , do you follow politics much ?"
12577,"yea , i didn't know the term congress originated in the middle ages"
12578,"i didn't know that either , that is very interesting . do you know who the only nonhuman to testify before them is ?"
12579,wasn't it elmo ? i wonder what he was testifying about
12580,"yeah good call ! i remember seeing that happen on tv but forgot why he did , or what he was testifying for i mean ."
12581,it's pretty cool that congressmen have their own exclusive subway lines
12582,"i didn't know that , i wonder how fast it actually is ."
12583,well those subway lines must not be too fast
12584,"lol , good one ! do you know what year the first woman was elected to congress ?"
12585,no but i heard the first woman was elected before they had the right to vote in a national election
12586,"that is true , and it was way back in 1916 i guess ."
12587,thank god they didn't have a fantasy congress back then
12588,"i think i read that before that there is a fantasy draft for the congress , count me out ."
12589,"yea , i wouldn't want to draft red or blue on any of my fantasy teams"
12590,"no , or have to do research about those people , not my idea of fun at all ."
12591,i find it ironic that 15 percent of the tea party identifies as democrats . sounds like they are very conflicted
12592,that is pretty funny . did you know that ronald reagan campaigned for the dems ?
12593,"lol no , he also campaigned against high corporate profits and low wages"
12594,"yeah isn't that funny , i feel like politics and politicians never do what they say or do the reverse ."
12595,it's a shame there hasn't been a nondemocrat or republican as president since 1853
12596,"that is a shame , i think it would be a nice change of pace to get something different in there ."
12597,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
12598,"hey there ! are you a soccer fan ? i do not watch a lot of it , but i do watch all of the world cup ! i am excited for 2022 in qatar !"
12599,the fifa world cup ? i really am not familiar with it . i only leanred a bit about it in school . i've forgotten what fifa even stands for . was the last cup exciting ?
12600,fifa stands for the federation internationale de football . it was exciting even with the us not in it .
12601,"oh , i remember now . is it sort of like having olympic games ? in the sense that it's international teams competing ?"
12602,"yes , and it is every four years since 1930 except for 1942 and '46 because of world war 2 ."
12603,every four years ? fifa fans has such a long suspenseful wait between big games ! i wonder if they have smaller yearly tournaments as well ?
12604,they govern most of soccer aside from the world cup .
12605,i wonder if fifa makes a lot of money from merchandise being sold like shirts and hats and things ?
12606,i am sure they make a ton of money . i have heard they are even corrupt . the sad thing is no host company has ever had any economic gains from hosting the world cup .
12607,that's not fair . maybe at least the get to keep money from concession stands at the fifa cups ?
12608,"they might get to , but the cost of the infrastructure to host the world must just be ridiculous ."
12609,have you ever seen the old uniforms from fifa cups years ago ? they look pretty different from today ! especially their trousers .
12610,"haha , yes . the word trouser is an important distinction because in the uk the word pants usually means underwear !"
12611,that's pretty funny ! i just heard on the news the other day how many us children are watching a british pig cartoon and they're picking up the british accent and style . they probably call pants trousers !
12612,"haha , that would be hilarious to have my daughter just randomly talk in a british accent !"
12613,"it's amazing what trends people will pick up on . in example , i heard there ways a style in china for gang members to wear as many shirts as they could and have the collars popped . must have been very hot !"
12614,"haha , that is so ridiculous ! i much prefer the hawaii business attire of an aloha shirt !"
12615,do you remember billy mays that oxiclean tv infomercial guy ? at his funeral blue shirts and khaki pants were worn by the pallbearers just like he'd wear in his infomercials .
12616,"i remember him , that is a touching tribute ! speaking of shirts , it is crazy that the polo shirt was originally invented just for tennis !"
12617,i've always wondered when we came up with neckties for mens' shirts . they seem like kind of a dangerous idea .
12618,"haha , no kidding . they are a pain to wear . wish we never had that idea !"
12619,did you know that mc hammer's pants were the model for aladdin's pants ? i would have thought it was the other way around !
12620,"that is a fun fact , i have heard that before and it makes sense . they look so similar ! i think i am going to listen to some hammer now , it was great chatting with you today !"
12621,sounds fun ! i actually need to get my self some new trousers . jeans to be exact . ttyl !
12622,frances mcdormand was very progressive in her best actress acceptance speech .
12623,it was powerful and a punch in the gut to the folks who run the oscars and the committee
12624,i think so too or she seems like a very strong person .
12625,were you a fan of hers before the oscars ?
12626,i do not think i've seen any films with her . i will have to watch some . which other movies is she in ?
12627,i am not sure but i was confused how the inclusion order does not apply to historical movies
12628,what are your favorite classic films ?
12629,to kill a mockingbird is my all time favorite
12630,"that's a wonderful book . i have not seen the film , though ."
12631,you should see it . just don't bother watching john carter as i hear it was a flop
12632,okay i won't . did you ever see black panther ? apparently black panther might be the richest super hero .
12633,i didn't but was curious to watch dorothy steel to see the 91 year old actress everyone is talking about
12634,she is in that film ? i don't recall .
12635,i also wanted to see forest whitaker and lupita as i am a big fan of theirs
12636,"i think they could have been used a little more , but the cast was very strong , overall ."
12637,do you think it will win any oscars ?
12638,"no , i don't think so . maybe for production or something ."
12639,did you know denzel paid the tuition for the main actor in the movie ?
12640,"i did not know that . is it michael b jordan ? or the black panther , himself ?"
12641,chadwick boseman . he owes denzel big time . . . lol
12642,"oh , i think that is black panther . wonderful chatting !"
12643,i think its great that minutuare horses are welcomed as service animals
12644,me too ! i wonder how many actual service animals are recognized since there are over 20 quintillion animals on the planet .
12645,"20 quintillion animals wow ! ! ! thats a lot , and i bet many of them are service animals ,"
12646,do tigers count as service animals because in asia more tigers are pets than wild ?
12647,"maybe they do , that would be interesting , domesticated animals develop white patches on their foreheads , i bet those tigers have the mark"
12648,probably ! can you imagine a country having more pets than kids under 15 ? japan has that . . .
12649,"thats crazy ! thats more than a pet per household ,"
12650,yup ! even theodore roosevelt had 20 pets !
12651,"20 pets ! he had a zoo at home lol , i wonder what kind of pets he had"
12652,i know he had a bear and a hyena .
12653,can bears and hyenas even be domesticated or even be legal to have as pet ! ! ! out of the 20 quintillion animals a million are insects
12654,i doubt it ! i do know that cats are domesticated and what's funny is the first cloned cat was named copy cat ! lol !
12655,"that is funny im more of a dog person myself , there are cat cafes in taiwan and japan , they must really love cats over there"
12656,"i like dogs more too , but even i don't like dogs enough to let one be my mayor like they did in talkeetna , alaska with a cat !"
12657,i heard mayor stubbs died ! i bet he did a better job than many politicians in our country
12658,i wonder how he even got on the ballot ? ! i wonder how he ever got anything done since a cat that lives for 15 years has spent 10 of the sleeping ?
12659,i guess it started as a joke but then it really catched on and he ended up winning the election many funny things happen by accident like the cat in the godfather 1
12660,very true and the loch ness monster being a protected species even though some don't believe he's real !
12661,"i dont think nessie is real but its nice to know he is a protected species , nessie must be part of a rare specie"
12662,i don't think he's real either . germany also loves their animals because they gave them constitutionally guaranteed rights . nice chatting with you !
12663,"i guess its fair to give them constitutional rights , some people can be really cruel to animals"
12664,hi . what kind of music do you like these days ?
12665,"i am all about rock and country music right now , how about you ?"
12666,i listen to country music a lot these days . do you know when did country music first got originated ?
12667,was it the 40s ?
12668,no . it was in the 1920s but it gained popularity in the 1940s .
12669,"nice , do you have a favorite country music singer ?"
12670,i really like blake sheldon but i also like george strait as well .
12671,me too ! george strait was great back in the day ! apparently he is jeff bezos cousin
12672,yes . i read that somewhere . that is a very interesting fact . do you know from where country music took its roots from by any chance ?
12673,i don't know that actually
12674,it was from folk and blues music which is surprising to me .
12675,i could see folk but not so much blues . that is interesting to say the least . henry ford i think had a part in country music becoming popular
12676,i agree . i think he helped financing its popularity . is that correct ?
12677,"yea , because he had a fear over the urban decadence of jazz music . . . ."
12678,ha ha ! ! that is both funny and interesting at the same time . do you know how many african american are in the country music hall of fame ?
12679,"i only know one african american and that is darius rocker , so maybe not many ?"
12680,they are just 2 african americans in the hall of fame .
12681,"wow , that is crazy . i wonder how many african americans currently sing country that may have the chance to be added ."
12682,i'm very sure that more will get added in near future . you mentioned earlier darius rucker which i'm a big fan of his .
12683,"for sure , i want to listen to some country now . it was so great chatting with you !"
12684,it was great chatting with you as well . thanks and have a nice night ! ! !
12685,"you too , thanks !"
12686,all the nation in the world want to lift the trophy is the fifa world cup which is also know as world cup . the football competition held between men team .
12687,"it is a classic to watch , do you have a favorite team ?"
12688,germany . which is your favourite team ?
12689,brazil ! my second home . it would be the usa but they are never in .
12690,the first international football is played between scotland and england in 1872 . the match was draw .
12691,that would have been exciting but i would want a winner . the us got third place in the first fifa world cup . . . in 1930 !
12692,"it is very interesting . in 1998 , 32 team are participate in the world cup before only 24 team are allowed in the world cup festival ."
12693,"i wonder why that is , only limited amount of room ?"
12694,"from 1930 to 1970 , the jules rimet trophy is awarded to the world cup winning team ."
12695,i never knew that ! do you have a favorite shirt ?
12696,polo shirt is my favourite . what about you ?
12697,i love polo shirts . they were originally invented for tennis players i think
12698,its is more comfortable to wear . it absorb the sweat very easily in the summer period . its is suitable for both hot and cold climate .
12699,"nice , i think they were created for the lacoste tennis play . i wonder why they chose polo"
12700,the business man use suite and tie for the professional meeting . it makes very neat and comfortable and give gentle look .
12701,"that makes sense , i can't stand the business look unfortunately . too classy for me ! did you hear what they wore at billy mays funeral ?"
12702,the shirts made of woven cloth is mainly used in earlier days .
12703,"yea , but they wore blue shirts and khaki pants at the funeral . good thing it wasn't aladdin's pants , they were modeled after mc hammer"
12704,its really very interesting .
12705,"for sure , good chatting with you !"
12706,yes . have a great day .
12707,you as well !
12708,"hi , do you know what inclusion rider is ?"
12709,i do not . i hear an oscar winner talked about it in her speech though
12710,yeah . i wonder what she was referring to ? it looks like she is helping the smaller roles on films .
12711,its to counter biases on casting . . i still dont think i understand all that it means but if you are making millions who can complain
12712,it is more about the extras and crew get represented equally in terms of real demographics .
12713,on another note . walt disney holds the record for most oscars with 22
12714,that's a lot . daniel daylewis has 3 !
12715,eminem has oscars ? ? ? for what ?
12716,"8 mile soundtrack . best original song , i think ."
12717,"well he has more than leo , jonny depp , will smith , george lucas and bill murray combined . im not sure any of them eve have an oscar"
12718,"leo got one for the revnant , right ?"
12719,did he ? maybe that was his first ? i know george didnt get any for star wars but his wife did for the editing
12720,that's nuts to me . i wonder if he was nominated ?
12721,i dont think so but im not for sure on that . the oscars are the oldest worldwide entertainment award show
12722,did you ever see black panther ? i feel like that should have been nominated .
12723,i actually couldnt get into it . i feel like it was nominated for something . did you know black panther is richer than tony stark ? !
12724,i did not . i kknow tony stark is rich so black panther has to be loaded !
12725,500 billion . tony is a mere 80 billion lol
12726,that can't even get you a good place in nyc ! how can he live ?
12727,"ha ! chadwick boseman was accepted to a premiere school and couldnt afford it , an anonymous benefactor paid for it . . turns out to be denzel"
12728,that's so kind of him . nice chatting with you !
12729,how would one bring a mini horse on a plane as a support animal ?
12730,"some of those miniature hoses are small , but they'd seem to still take up a lot of space on a plane . i would not want to be next to one ."
12731,no particularly because i've been around horses . if it isn't trained properly that is going to be one foul smelling plane .
12732,that crossed my mind too . a monkey would be of concern for me too . eventually a line has to be draw .
12733,yeah i can see dogs and maybe even a cat but when it devolves into strange animals i think it is okay to say no . i get it is their support but there has to be a line for everyone else's safety .
12734,"snakes too , it reminds me of that movie a few years back , snakes on a plane . maybe i could take my service elephant on my next flight ."
12735,lol they might balk at that a bit . it is not a popular opinion i'm sure but i think that there should be laws about what constitues a service animal and it should be limited to certain animals for public safety .
12736,"agreed i know there is the american with disabilities act , and it has to be honored , but you have to think of everyone else when making decisions ."
12737,so true . i think everyone is so scared of offending someone that we are allowing things that are just utterly ridiculous .
12738,"my daughter would love a horse , miniature or otherwise . it's just not in our budget ."
12739,horses do tend to get spendy . especially the miniature versions . when you get a mini version of something they are inclined to health problems because of the breeding that has been done . they also don't tend to live as long .
12740,"i did not know that , sounds like you know a bit a about horses . do you have pets ?"
12741,i have a couple dogs but we had a horse growing up and we knew lots of horse people including a mini breeder . i don't think he had them as emotional support animals though .
12742,"there's a famous advert from britain featuring a shetland pony . it became famous for about two weeks for doing a moonwalk or something , faked of course ."
12743,nice . they can do so many cool tricks if trained properly why bother to fake something like that ? do you have pets ?
12744,"kids have rabbits each , and we have a small dog . my daughter come home one day and said she wanted a snake , we compromised with the rabbit ."
12745,i couldn't have a snake . i don't mind them outside but inside would be a hard no from me too . rabbits are nice . quite a docile pet .
12746,"we got really lucky with the rabbits , they put up with a lot from the kids . my wife used to breed them when she was young and did them for 4h ."
12747,there are some beautiful rabbit breeds out there . it is always fun to walk through the building at the county fair and see them . i wouldn't mind having an angora .
12748,my daughter wants to train her ever since she saw a youtube video of rabbits leaping a fenced obstacle course .
12749,that would be so cool to see . it has to be easier to do than trying to train a cat like you see a bunch of people on youtube doing .
12750,are you a comic book fan ? ? i am a huge fan . dis you know disney bought marvel in 2009 .
12751,"no , i didn't know that ."
12752,marvel started in 1939 . stan lee and jack kirby created fantasic four and many others .
12753,"cool , did you see black panther ?"
12754,"yes , it was great . sony had a chance to buy all of marvel's cinematic rights for 25 million . however they turned it down amd only bought the rights to spiderman for 10 million . big mistake ."
12755,"wow , did you know that black panther is the richest of all the superheroes ?"
12756,"man , i didn't know that . i did know that there is one character owned by both marvel and dc . his name is access and his whole purpose is to keep both company universis separate ."
12757,cool . did you see avengers infinity war ?
12758,"yes , i have seen all the marvel movies . i heard that marvel created a superhero specifically for a 4 year old named ' blue ear ' because the boy was uncomfortable wearing hearing aides ."
12759,what was the superpower of the blue ear superhero ?
12760,that i don't know . but the boy told his mom that ' superheros don't wear hearing aids ' so marvel created one .
12761,"oh , did you know that according to marvel mutants are not humans ?"
12762,i have read that before . you mentioned infinity war . that was the first movie ever shot entirely with digital imax cameras .
12763,did digital imax cameras make the movie look better and if so why ?
12764,"that , i do not know . i am not that knowledgeable . jarvis , who is in the iron man films and avengers is never actually seen on screen , only his voice ."
12765,interesting . what are the infinity stones in the mcu ?
12766,when the universe was created it was broken up into 6 infinity stones that were all powerful .
12767,"oh , did you know marvel comics used to be called atlas comics ?"
12768,"now that , i did not know . i did know that black panther was not named after the black panther party . the comic character actually predates the founding of the party ."
12769,fascinating . what other marvel movies is chris evans in besides avengers : infinity war ?
12770,"well , i will leave you with this . chadwick boseman , who played black panther was accepted into a prestigious summer theater program at oxford university . i hope you have a great new year ."
12771,"hello , do you know much about congress ?"
12772,"i know a little bit about congress . i know that there are three subway lines that are exclusive to us congress members , thats pretty crazy"
12773,"i think that is amazing , and so convenient for them not to have to take public transportation ."
12774,yes i agree with you . i also know that the democrats and republicans plan annual baseball game . they've been doing it since 1909
12775,"nice , that seems like its just putting fuel to the fire lol"
12776,yep i agree with you . and republicans are up by three points haha which is definitely something that they will keep in mind when they're making laws probably lol
12777,haha right !
12778,there's also people that do fantasy congress ? i didn't know that because you would think there was only fantasy football . but people make a fantasy sport out of anything i guess haha .
12779,yeah ive even heard of fantasy spelling bees lol
12780,"haha i guess . also weird is that elmo testified before congress , he's the only nonhuman person to do so , so i assume that he did it in character lol that's weird"
12781,"that is weird , i wonder why though . i hope its on video somewhere lol"
12782,"haha i must be on youtube somewhere . pretty cool though that the first woman was elected to congress in 1916 . that means that she was elected before any woman had the right to vote , so men had voted her in ."
12783,that is pretty cool .
12784,think about the democrat party by the way ? the modern democratic party was founded in 1828 by supporters of andrew jackson apparently . i didn't know that
12785,there hasnt been a us president who wasnt a rep or dem since 1853 !
12786,"nope that's a long time ! it's also interesting how the parties have shifted in their ideas over time , for instance , ronald reagan used to campaign as a democrat to rally against high corporate profits and lower wages"
12787,yeah . did you know 15 percent of the tea party movement identified with democrat
12788,"no i didn't know that . that is interesting though . i also didn't know that the colors of red and blue were not typically used with democrats and republicans , that is a more recent invention"
12789,"yeah me either , i thought it has always been like that lol"
12790,do you watch the simpsons by the way ? fox news tried to sue them because they were making fun of them . what fox owns the simpsons i thought ? so how would that work ?
12791,yeah i used to love the simpsons . thats hilarious .
12792,have you seen black panther ?
12793,"hello there , i have not seen it yet no . i would like to though , how about you ?"
12794,"i'm interested too . he's supposed to be the richest superhero in the world , richer than bruce wayne . of course , is batman really a superhero ?"
12795,"yeah i had heard that , i am surprised there is a superhero that has more wealth than bruce wayne ."
12796,"well , walt disney has enough money to buy marvel , so they are probably richer than everyone else involved ."
12797,yeah that is true . did you know they briefly changed the name to black leopard at one point ?
12798,i did not know that . i thought it had something to do with the black panther party .
12799,"yeah i think that is why they changed it for a short period , because they didn't want people to be confused ."
12800,yeah . i don't think globalization was a black panther platform . they probably advocated more isolationist or separatist policies .
12801,yeah you might be right on that . are you a fan of marvel comics in general ?
12802,i liked marvel when i was a kid . i recently saw a clip or robert downy jr playing iron man . ac dc was the background music . looks great .
12803,"yeah he plays the iron man character in all the movies . i haven't seen them , but know that he does ."
12804,"marvel has so many superheros . i hear they created one , blue ear , just for a single fan ."
12805,"yeah i thought that was really cool , i think he is a deaf character that uses hearing aids ."
12806,i like the villains too . dr strange is quite the intellectual .
12807,"yeah i have only heard good things about that one , but again i have not had a chance to see it . and yeah , i think they have to make them just as good as the heroes ."
12808,a lot of people like killmonger . the russo directors do a good job with a variety of characters .
12809,i have never heard of that one but sounds very interesting . what is your favorite villian of all time ?
12810,danny devito's penguin . but m'baku evolving into a villain seems interesting .
12811,"nice ! yeah he was awesome in that , there are some scenes that i will never forget with him in that character . politics at its finest ."
12812,i would advise staying offline to avoid spoilers . they are everywhere .
12813,"yeah i think you are right . well it was nice talking with you today , i hope you have a nice day ."
12814,do you enjoy films ?
12815,"i do , i like to watch movies , do you ?"
12816,i do too . i recently enjoyed spiderverse and black panther
12817,"black panther was a great movie i really liked it , hope there's a second part of the film ."
12818,well the marvel movies are a progression of the power stones
12819,"did you like the leading actor , chadwick boseman ?"
12820,i think he is doing well
12821,"he is a great actor , fun fact about black panther but he is actually the richest super hero out there"
12822,"well while bruce wayne and ironman own companies , black panther owns a country"
12823,yeah that kind of makes sense still bruce wayne was like the richest hero surprising to hear his not .
12824,i still fell batman is the rich superhero
12825,"i guess 80 billion is a lot of money , do you like tom hanks ?"
12826,"ya , why ?"
12827,"he is the highest all time box office star , he has earned a lot of money over the years ."
12828,that is pretty cool . would you rather be nominated for the oscars a dozen or so times and never receive it or just never be nominated ?
12829,i would like to be nominated . can be really frustrating but in the end being nominated would make me grow as an actor what about you ?
12830,"i guess i agree , but being nominated so many times , but never winning would still be a bit depressing"
12831,"it would be depressing , yeah , just like the movie trojan wars and their box office of barely 309 after a 15 million investment ."
12832,lol true true . well box office doesn't accurately indicate the quality of a film
12833,it doesn't many good films had a terrible box office like sleeping beauty or treasure planet .
12834,"true true , but both are films that are core to my childhood . in any case , thanks for chatting ."
12835,hello ! how are you today ?
12836,i'm doing good . what about you ?
12837,"same here , just watching a movie on netflix . do you like watching movies ?"
12838,"i do , and unlike a lot of people i like the oscars . did you know the oscars were nominated for 9 emmy's in 2013 ?"
12839,they must have not had many other nominees back then lol . it seems like walt disney would have won since he's won so many in his life !
12840,i'm pretty sure walt has 22 oscars under his name .
12841,that is a lot of oscars ! it's funny to think eminem has more oscars than some super famous people .
12842,does he really ? like who ?
12843,"he has more than johnny depp , leonardo decaprio , will smith , george lucas , and bill murray combined !"
12844,wow ! that is pretty amazing . have you heard of the movie blazing saddles ?
12845,"i've seen it , it is a funny comedy . you don't see many comedies at the academy awards though ."
12846,"well , surprisingly that one has been nominated for 3 oscars !"
12847,very cool ! have you seen the movie black panther ?
12848,"i have not seen it , but i've heard about it ."
12849,that won a lot of oscars this year . i enjoyed watching it for sure ! he's considered the richest superhero .
12850,"yeah , i've heard he has an estimated wealth of 500 billion ."
12851,that's so much more than tony stark's 100 billion . just give me one billion of that and i'll be happy lol .
12852,i would be too . the marvel comics character black panther was not named after the black panther party .
12853,didn't he predate the party itself ?
12854,"yes , that is correct ."
12855,"i'm going to look more into the movie . i enjoyed chatting , have a great day !"
12856,hey there did you know that gov . employees have their own personal subway in washington dc ?
12857,i think i heard that before . it makes sense for safety reasons . it's actually three different subway lines
12858,"ya its a good idea , weird that us congress does baseball games every year , and i guess republicans are up by 3 overall"
12859,"it's america's pastime , and it's good camaraderie . plus , for a tradition to be going on for 110 years , that's not much of a win difference"
12860,"ya hopefully it heals their differences , would you ever play fantasy politics btw ?"
12861,"i can barely keep up on politics , though some who have a strong interest in it would find it fun . a woman was elected to congress before she had the right to vote"
12862,that is weird ! that means that men voted her in !
12863,"exclusively men . maybe many of them were vying for change as much as women were . that , or maybe her name sounded masculine . they didn't have television back then for everyone to be familiar with faces"
12864,"ya thats true , did you hear about the only nonhuman to testify before congress ?"
12865,wasn't it elmo ? i wonder how that worked considering he's a puppet
12866,"haha ya i don't know it seems dumb to me , like is it elmo or the puppeteer really testifying haha"
12867,exactly . what's interesting is that the term for congress goes as far back as the late middle ages . that's a long time ago
12868,"wow that is a long time , do you like the democrat party ?"
12869,"there are good and bad things about both parties , apparently the simpsons are antidemocratic to the point that fox threatened to sue them"
12870,"ya that is weird , but yes kind of crazy that red and blue only started being used for dems and repubs in 2000"
12871,that's probably when campaigning became a big deal . it's less weird than the fact that the name was originally the democraticrepublican party
12872,"ya that name just would confuse me haha , weird too that 15 percent of tea partiers identify as the democrats"
12873,"i'm not even sure what the tea party movement is supposed to be . for over 150 years now , all presidents have been either republican or democrat"
12874,"ya that is a long time , weird too that reagan campaigned for the democrats back in his younger years"
12875,he was against low wages and high corporate profits . who knows what changes took place between then and when he became president
12876,"ya , do you like jazz music btw or i know that clint eastwood does"
12877,"i like it in small doses , and i like music that has jazz elements added to it . maybe that's why he was even interested in million dollar baby"
12878,"hi , do you like marvel comics ?"
12879,i wouldn't say that i'm into the comics so much but i have enjoyed the movies . i know a little about the comics .
12880,"same here . in 1998 , marvel offered its movie rights to almost all of its characters to sony for 25 million ."
12881,oh wow ! that was a mistake . i can't imagine how much those movies have made combined . have you heard of the superhero blue ear ?
12882,i have not head of blue ear . which character is that ?
12883,marvel created the character just for a young boy who was uncomfortable wearing the hearing aids that he needed and stated that superheroes don't wear hearing aids .
12884,wow that's pretty amazing . wish more companies did acts of kindness like that .
12885,i agree . it was incredible nice of them . did you now that sir isaac newton is in the marvel universe ?
12886,i did not know that . that's pretty cool .
12887,i agree . he was once sorcerer supreme which is the same title given to doctor strange .
12888,very cool . do you like the avengers ?
12889,i do .
12890,i saw that the infinity war movie was the first film to ever be shot entirely with digital imax cameras .
12891,oh wow . i did not know that . infinity war is very good . did you know that the actor who plays jarvis has never seen the films ?
12892,really ? does it say why he never watched them ?
12893,no i have not heard why . i have heard many actors say they do watch their own movies because they are too critical on themselves so perhaps that's why .
12894,that's really odd . i saw the waitress captain america saves voiced gretchen in the recess .
12895,i did not know that . that's very interesting . did you know that robert downey jr hid food on the avengers set ?
12896,i did not know that . does it say why ?
12897,he does not but nobody could find his hiding spots and when he is eating blueberries on screen it's unscripted and part of his stash .
12898,it was great talking to you !
12899,"hi , how are you ?"
12900,"hey ! i'm great thanks , how are you today ? have you ever seen avengers : infinity war ? it's the first film ever to be filmed entirely with digital imax cameras ."
12901,i have seen that movie . i really liked it . did you see it ?
12902,"no i didn't . i'm not really into superhero movies . i haven't seen black panther either , the other marvel comics superhero film ."
12903,i really liked black panther . he is the richest superhero !
12904,yeah i know ! richer than bruce wayne who has a net worth of 80 billion . i don't even know what i'd do with 1 billion .
12905,i would find a way to be happy . . . his estimated wealth is at 500 billion !
12906,"i thought otherwise , but black panther wasn't named after the black panther party . the comic actually predates the group ."
12907,the symbols and written script aren't made up . they are actually based on actual script call nsibdi . it dates back to the 4th century .
12908,that's interesting . i know too that marvel censored ' praise hanuman ! ' because they feared it would lead to backlash .
12909,did you see chadwick boseman was accepted into an oxford program and couldn't afford it but denzel washington paid for him to go ?
12910,that's admirable of denzel washington ! i actually just watched the movie american gangster last night . and boseman didn't get to thank denzel in person until 20 years later at black panther's premier .
12911,wow . that's really nice . did you know the voice actor who did jarvis for the iron man series and avengers has never seen the films ?
12912,"ha maybe he's not a fan of superhero movies like me . are you a fan of marvel comics ? they're responsible for so many superheros . daredevil , ghostrider , the hulk , magneto , etc . . . ."
12913,i do like them but i do not go out of my way to watch them . i feel like they have saturated the market with them .
12914,agreed . it's crazy that they offered their cinematic rights to sony for only 25m but sony rejected it and bought spiderman for 10m .
12915,seems like a lack of vision on their part . do you know what shawarma is ?
12916,maybe . . is it a type of food ?
12917,i am not sure . i do know the avengers caused an increase in its sales . . .
12918,"hmm . i gotta look that up haha . did you know lou ferrigno , who played the hulk in the 1970s series , still voices the character and has been for decades ?"
12919,i had no idea ! nice chatting with you !
12920,"hello , how are you ?"
12921,i am good ! have you seen the movie ant man and wasp ?
12922,"no , i have not . have you ? sounds interesting ."
12923,no i have not either ! paul rudd is in it . do you know who he is ?
12924,"yes , i like him . he's a good actor . do you watch boxing matches ?"
12925,yeah he is ! no o do not
12926,boxing matches have to breaks so they don't do something wrong and to not keep pounding each other .
12927,oh really ? they are called rounds aren ; t they ?
12928,"yes , next spring the fourth avengers movie comes out . have you seen any ?"
12929,yeah . . . just saw infinity war and it was really good ! did you see it ?
12930,"no , good to know , i want to see that . do you like marvel comics ?"
12931,yes very much ! some of the movies are redundant though ! that's cool the lou ferrigno has been doing the voice of hulk !
12932,"yes , i agree with you on that . walt disney company acquired marvel entertainment ."
12933,"yeah , i saw that ! seems like they have been doing a good job with the movies ?"
12934,"yes , but they don't have the rights to the movie big , xmen and spiderman ."
12935,oh . . . i did not know that ?
12936,i love that they made a movie called blue ear about a 4 year old with earring issues .
12937,"awww . . . that is awesome and thoughtful ! see , there is one charecter that is owned by dc and marvel ? i wonder who it is ?"
12938,"i know , i don't know . the boy told his mom , superheros don't wear hearing aids , so marvel created one . great chat ! !"
12939,too bad sony didn't buy all the marvel characters ? lol
12940,"agree , have a great day !"
12941,thanks !
12942,you too .
12943,are you a fan of antman ?
12944,"i've heard of him but haven't seen that movie . i did see black panther , though ."
12945,did you like the black panther movie ?
12946,"i thought it was kind of ridiculous , but that's how i feel about superhero movies in general . i think the theme of isolationism vs global revolution sent a very mixed message ."
12947,"you dont like superhero movies ! ! we are on a different page there lol , but i see your point"
12948,"i think i was more significant for providing a vehicle for black actors , like the 91 year old woman who made her big film debut as a tribal elder after sending in an audition tape ."
12949,"really i never paid attention to her , whats her name do you know ?"
12950,"dorothy steel ; she began acting at 88 . seems like a very late start compared to chadwick boseman , whose education at a summer theater program at oxford was funded by denzel washington ."
12951,"denzel washington really did that kid a solid , maybe he can appear in one of the black panther movies in a future , that would be interesting to watch"
12952,he's almost old enough to be a tribal elder at this point haha . he certainly could find a role in any of the marvel franchisesit's pretty lucrative for a studio that had to use its ip as collateral when securing funding from merrill lynch .
12953,"yeah , his an actor that would fit in the franchise perfectly , and what about infinity war did you watch the first part ?"
12954,"i did not see that , but i heard a lot of big names like robert downey jr . and scarlett johansson were in it ."
12955,"yeah mark ruffalo , chris evans , don cheadle , chadwick boseman many great actors , the cast is crazy even dave bautista is a hero"
12956,i heard that robert downey jr . would actually hide food on set and actually used hidden food in scenes . kind of gross but funny .
12957,"that is funny well he is like the leading actor of them all so i guess his entitled to anything ,"
12958,"yes , although it seems like there's a wide scope of behaviors allowed in the studio ; the voice actor who played jarvis in the iron man and avengers series has never even seen the films !"
12959,"never really ? that is unusual , another funny fact is how the shawarma sales went up lol"
12960,"i guess people are pretty easily influenced , although sometimes it's the other way around ; marvel actually created a new superhero just for a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable with wearing hearing aids and whose mother had told him that superheroes don't wear hearing aids ."
12961,"thats admirable , creating a hero to help a kid in trouble , do you know the name of that superhero ? i have to look him up ."
12962,"its name is blue ear , which is probably on the same level of creativity as antman . some people are less than even that creative , though ; michael jackson tried to buy marvel so he could play spider man in his own movie !"
12963,"thats crazy thank god he didnt buy the franchise that would be terrible , he would ruin the hero lol"
12964,"yes , i wonder how he would've felt about black panther ; maybe his sister will be in the next one with angela bassett . nice chatting !"
12965,"avengers : infinity war , sounds like quite a movie . have you seen or heard about it ?"
12966,absolutely ! its a great movie ! they are coming out with a sequel to it this year !
12967,so these movies are a continuation from a previous one . i know the marvel characters are highly popular .
12968,sort of . most of the marvel movies are touched in infinity war because all of the characters make an appearance .
12969,that is interesting . i imagine the sequel coming out will be a very popular movie . do the same actors play in each movie ?
12970,"no . sometimes ant man will make an appearance in captain america movie , but not all of them are in every movie . infinity war will be super popular because the first one was left with a dilemma . its a great series you should watch it !"
12971,"i will have to try and watch it ! sounds quite interesting . i read that the characters had a falling out in the captain america civil war but they will work together , as the need for help is there ."
12972,"yes , a huge falling out , the group was divided . this is an interesting fact : when robert downey jr . was on the set of the avengers he would hide food on the sets . nobody was ever able to find it so they let him continue to do it . the scenes where he is eating blueberries and shawarma are unscripted and a part of the collection of food that he hid ."
12973,that is an interesting fact . i had not heard that before . now the infinity stones are a part of each movie . each stone is a different power or something and there are 6 of them .
12974,"not each movie , they are more shown in infinity war . a stone has mad an appearance in dr . strange and iron man and i think galaxy of the guardians . but yes each stone has a different power ! i dont remember what each power is , except one is the power of time ."
12975,sounds like a fantastic idea . the stories are a bit sci fi as well as superhero then . i did not know lou ferrigno has voiced one of the characters . i remember him from the hulk show back in the 70's .
12976,"right ! i cant remember which character though , which is funny because someone else plays the hulk in the marvel movies , mark ruffalo"
12977,"yes , he played the hulk in the tv show and bill bixby played dr . david bruce banner . i did not realize that is the same hulk character that mark ruffalo plays in the movies ."
12978,"yes , it is . he plays bruce banner and i think the voice of the hulk . the hulk is cgi . hes great ! really has that awkward or smart guy thing down ."
12979,"i read here that the avengers caused an increase in shawarma sales , is that some kind of food that they eat ? i never heard of it ."
12980,because of the fact i mentioned earlier lol . robert downey jr eats it in one or two scenes lol its a greek dish if i remember .
12981,"lol , yes the unscripted food scenes you mentioned . of course . have you seen the black panther movie ."
12982,"yes , ive seen all of the marvel movies . black panther is another great one !"
12983,sounds like an interesting one as well . i guess i have been missing a lot not seeing all these movies . do you know when the next may be coming out ?
12984,"all i know is its coming out this year . you should get started on the marvel series now , thats a lot of movies ! !"
12985,"lol , it certainly is . i will have to watch all the time in order to catch up before the new one comes out . well thank you for filling me in on all the information , it has been wonderful chatting with you !"
12986,have a good one !
12987,do you watch the olympic ?
12988,"yes , i am a big olympic fan . john daly came in 16th . this is probably his last olympics ."
12989,yes he wrote about that in a twit . i think he came back though .
12990,"oh , he did . i didn't know that . are you a soccer fan . did you watch the fifa world cup ."
12991,i did not . which teams played in that game ?
12992,"well , all of them play in the world cup . there have been 21 world cup tournaments ."
12993,i hear there still looking for a location for the 2022 qatar fifa world cup .
12994,"not exactly . however , the city that is set to host the 2022 qatar fifa world cup does not exist yet ."
12995,"the hungary national football team only had one defeat between 1950 and 1956 , and that was the world cup final . do you like this team ? who's your favorite ?"
12996,"they are ok . my favorite team is the us . speaking of that , an american team has never placed below third place in the world cup since 1991 , the year the women's world cup started ."
12997,"that's awesome ! i hear that the championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930 , except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the second world war ."
12998,"that makes since . you mentioned 1930 . that year , the us got 3rd place ."
12999,i guess its just an honor to host the game because there are no net economic gains for the countries that have played host to the olympics or the world cup
13000,"changing topics a little , i am a fan of fashion . did you know that during the cultural revolution , in china , gang fashion involved layering as many shirts as you could and popping their collars . weird"
13001,really weird ! did you know in hawaii you don't have to wear a suit and tie to work .
13002,"good , i hate suites and ties . i saw where a judge in d . c sued a small dry cleaning business for over 67 million . they lost his pants . what a jerk ."
13003,"67 million , thats crazy . sometimes i think we put to much emphasis on clothing in this country . did you know some wedding dresses go for as much as 10k"
13004,"yes , i did know that . here is something that i wish every city would do . ' saggy pants ' are against the law in collinsville , il ."
13005,yes please no body wants to see there underwear . they should make them pull their trousers up !
13006,i can't stand seeing kids where them sagging so that they waddle . a funny fact is that aladdin's pants were supposed to look like mc hammer's pants .
13007,"that's to funny ! in the united kingdom , the word pants generally means underwear and not trousers ."
13008,"well , the last thing i will say is that people wear pants because of horses . in the army back in the day , when riding horses armies wearing pants were more effective than those wearing robes ."
13009,good to know i gain i lot . thanks for talking with me .
13010,thanks
13011,hello ! do you like jazz music ?
13012,"i am a big fan , but being from new orleans where jazz originated , its almost a requirement ."
13013,that's awesome you're from there ! i would love to see those street musicians ! clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz fan .
13014,"its root combines africanamerican music traditions , along with brass bands , french quadrilles , ragtime and blues"
13015,interesting ! a woman from harlem has held jazz concerts in her apartment every sunday for 20 years !
13016,thats cool . i did not know that pakistan has a jazz group which is topping the charts !
13017,who would have thought that ? do you follow politics at all ?
13018,"yes i am a big democrat . worked on beto o'rourkes campaign last fall . even though he did not get into the congress , one of the 3 parts of government , i have hope that he will go for president ."
13019,i bet that was interesting ! there hasn't been a u . s president who wasn't republican or democrat since 1853 .
13020,yes and the parties have changed a lot ronald reagan used to actively campaign for democrats and was against low wages .
13021,interesting ! i didn't know that the red and blue colors for republicans and democrats only started to be consistently used in 2000 . seems to me i remember that long before then .
13022,i am not sure . i did find it funny that fox news threatened to sue the simpsons they apparently did not like being made fun of
13023,that's funny . doesn't fox own the simpsons ?
13024,that is a good question i am not sure . did you know that elmo actually testified before congress ?
13025,lol no . i didn't know that . the first woman elected to congress was in 1916 .
13026,and she did not even have a right to vote at that time ! that is insane
13027,yes . the republicans and democrats in the us congress have played an annual baseball game since 1909 . that's over 100 years !
13028,that is pretty impressive . the republicans are winning by 3 wins over those years . . but the dems will come back !
13029,awesome . i was wondering what their record was .
13030,have you heard of fantasy congress ? its like fantasy football but you draft members of congress !
13031,i never heard of that until just now . i have to get going . it was nice chatting with you ! have a good day !
13032,"a congress is a formal meeting of the representatives of different nations , states , organizations trade unions and political parties ."
13033,"really , tell me more about it ."
13034,the leader discuss about the welfare of the union or people and adopt new plans for the people .
13035,how interesting . did you know that the us congress has played a baseball game annually since 1909 .
13036,its very interesting . in 1916 the first woman was elected to congress before she even had the right to vote in a national election .
13037,well im sure that did a lot for womens rights . just inspiring in my opinion .
13038,"jazz is a music which originated in the new orleans , of the united states ."
13039,i actually knew that one . are you a jazz fan .
13040,"yes , jazz is also know as ' american classical music ' jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression ."
13041,you are a wealth of knowledge . did you know clint eastwood liked jazz ?
13042,"yes , he is popular in rawhide series . he is multi talented person ."
13043,"yes he is . he actually scored the movie he also produced , million dollar baby . have you seen it ."
13044,"yes , cool jazz developed at the early of 1940 introducing calm , smoother sound and liner melodic lines ."
13045,"cool , there is a jazz orchestra in pakistan that is currently topping the charts . guess its still in"
13046,there is a programming language in which the programs are in the musical composition . in the early stage its very difficult to compose jazz music .
13047,i believe it . i dont think i could do it even if i tried .
13048,"jazz is a form of independent traditional and popular musical styles , jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes , call and response vocals and improvisation ."
13049,it also has roots in west african cultural and musical expression .
13050,you watch any jazz musical concert ?
13051,i dont actually . how bout you .
13052,15 percent of the tea party movement identify themselves as democrats .
13053,that's very interesting . i'm going to have to be getting to work though . you have a good day .
13054,my dog is watching me .
13055,ominously ? should i call someone for you ?
13056,"no , he just keeps an eye on things . in case of snacks . you can never tell when i will call snack time . he is a lot more fun than a pet frog ."
13057,i bet . what kind of dog do you have ?
13058,he is a shelter dog . mostly black lab . but something in there brings the crazy . do you have pet animals ? are you ailurophile ?
13059,i am not . i am a cynophile . i just put my st bernard down last month . she was 10 and lived past her avg age . she was great .
13060,"big dogs are fun , but short on time . i might be allergic to cats ."
13061,"i am allergic to dogs , which i found out when my st bernard was like 2 . didn't stop me from loving her though . i have 2 cats and hate one of them and tolerate the other ."
13062,wow . i like the idea that a 15 year old cat has spent 10 years asleep . if only i could do that .
13063,would you ever get a pet bear ? roosevelt had one .
13064,"no , no thanks to the bear . i think it is great that people have such a variety of pets . had a hamster as a kid . some people would count a horse as a pet ."
13065,"i hope this doesn't come off as callous but when people have a tiger or bear as a pet , i have no sympathy when they get attacked by it . it's a bear ! it does bear things , like maul people and things . did you hear about that girl who fell into a cage trying to take a selfie ?"
13066,"yes , a jaguar i think . beautiful animal . it survived unharmed . there were some cases a few years ago where a gorilla was shot to get the kid back . tough call ."
13067,"harambe , right ? i find the girl to be incredibly dumb and nothing should happen to the cat . just poor judgment ."
13068,"yes , harambe . it was poor judgment . i know of a kentucky town called rabbit hash , their mayor is a dog . i see that a town in alaska has a cat for a mayor . i wonder if they trade post cards . sister cities and all ."
13069,i don't think . they don't get along . they fight like cats and dogs .
13070,"right , that is always a risk . i have never had a cat . it is said they fight , but really , does it not depend . did your dog care at all about the cats ?"
13071,not really . every once in a while she would let them know she was big but that happened infrequently . the young cat would play fight with the dog's tail and the dog was completely indifferent .
13072,"i think that most dogs would learn to tolerate what they can not catch . if i write a paper , i would list my dog as a coauthor . i think he would like that ."
13073,that would be nice . i think he deserves it .
13074,some one around here deserves something . take it easy out there .
13075,morning . do you like cats ?
13076,"i'm more of a dog person , but cats are cool . i hear there are cafes in japan where you pay hourly to drink and hang with cats ."
13077,yes that would be fun to see . the life of the cat seems nice . so much sleeping .
13078,"yeah , by the time a cat reaches 15 years old , it's spent about 10 years of its life sleeping ."
13079,lucky cats ! have you ever seen the godfather ? the cat in the opening scene was found on set .
13080,that's cool . i love the godfather . no wonder that cat is so restless in the scene . there's a town in alaska that's had a cat name stubbs as mayor since 1997 . wonder if it has its own office ?
13081,i bet it does there are not many people in alaska ! such a unique name too . . . talkeetna .
13082,"speaking of cats in odd positions , a physicist once published a paper with a cat as coauthor so he could write using the first person plural ."
13083,that is pretty ingenious . that way he wouldn't be criticized . i like his style !
13084,the first cloned pet was actually a cat . can you guess its name ?
13085,interesting . haha copy cat ! very clever !
13086,love it ! did you know there are more tigers living as pets in the us than living in the wild in asia ? that's nuts .
13087,that is sad to hear . maybe teddy roosevelt had one ? he had a bear and a hyena !
13088,"a pet hyena sounds like a really , really bad idea . there are more pets in japan than there are children under 15 ."
13089,"wow those japanese love their pets ! apparently in boulder colorado , it is illegal to own pets ."
13090,what ? that seems crazy ! wonder if there are ways around that law ?
13091,"oh now that you ask , yes i believe they just actually say you can be a pets ' guardian ' and it is basically the same thing !"
13092,too funny . germany became the first country in the world to give animals legal rights guaranteed by the constitution . probably can't call them pets there either .
13093,"yes good point . i wonder if germany allows all pets ? the reason i ask is because there are so many pets like rabbits , ferrets , pigs , gerbils , hamsters , chinchillas , and many more ! well i really enjoyed chatting with you this morning ."
13094,"yes , me too !"
13095,i am gonna go look up pets online ! have a good one !
13096,do you like folk music ? i love it but i suppose that makes sense since i am from appalachia which is one of the homes of folk music !
13097,i love all country music . i grew up listening to it .
13098,"that's great . there are so many sub genres and different origins for folk styles , from america to europe so really there's probably something for everyone , even if they have different tastes ."
13099,i think steel guitars have opened up some new avenues for all kinds of music for sure . it has a unique sound
13100,"oh totally , there is this one alternative ' shoegaze ' band that i like that utilizes steel guitars for a nice dreamy tone ."
13101,i love that u2 pretended to be a country band and no one noticed .
13102,there definitely must be a crossover between those genres .
13103,oh for sure . they both have their roots in the english ballads i feel .
13104,it's also funny because guitars like the fender stratocaster were designed for country music specifically but i know that that's a popular guitar among punk and indie musicians .
13105,and we always think of the violin as such a classical instrument but it is included in so much of country music that it is iconic .
13106,i think that combo of electric and acoustic guitars is such a classic across many genres now too .
13107,very true . i have a hard time with george strait and jeff bezos being cousins though
13108,"i know , that's so weird ! i am always hearing about famous people who are surprisingly related like that ."
13109,right ? ! they just seem to be polar opposites .
13110,"seriously , that's true . but i guess success comes in many forms since they're both doing so well for themselves ."
13111,very true . i think people still have a stigma about country because of its hillbilly roots .
13112,"if so i think that's simply because people fail to understand the rich , deep history of the genre they think it's all about modern day redneck behavior but these are genres that were born nearly a hundred years ago at least ."
13113,very true . it has woven through blues and rock .
13114,"so true ! but then again , ' country ' was the most listened to rush hour radio genre just about ten years ago ."
13115,musical tastes change so much in such a short time . it is good thoughopens peoples eyes to the world around them .
13116,"it can almost be a bit sad too . i just read the other day that hip hop or rap is now overwhelmingly the most popular genre in the us now , which i am not a fan of , but i guess technically it's like modern jazz ."
13117,i would much rather have vintage jazz . there is something unsettling yet beautiful about the musical arrangements .
13118,"hi , do you like pets ?"
13119,"yes , i like to study pets , all things pets and cats ."
13120,did you know in fact the first cloned pet was a cat !
13121,"what , i did not know that ! crazy ! i even like to believe in the loch ness monster , lol . ya know the scottish put forth provisions to protect it in 1912 ."
13122,"wow , protect a monster ! ! that is so funny . . . and just so you know the name of the cloned cat , is copy cat !"
13123,"oh geez , copy cat ! that is too funny , these too story both sound fiction even though one isn't . ya know there are 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth , with us ."
13124,"that is so cool ! i love animals , i just need a little more time to study all of them ! hahaha did you know is illegal to own a pet in boulder , co ?"
13125,what its illegal to own a pet ? how can that possibly be ? that sounds crazy .
13126,but they say you can be the pet's guardian . . who can understand that ?
13127,"oh wow , okay , i see what you mean . its word games . i was noticing that in japan there are more pets than children !"
13128,"wow , how could this be ! and i did learn that there are more tigers that are livings as pets that living a wild life in asia ! !"
13129,"yike , tigers don't seem like ideal pets ! our former president roosevelt had over 20 pets while he in the white house ."
13130,"wow ! he loved animals , wonder what kind of animals he had ?"
13131,"he had a bear , hyena and many other random animals . i guess he loved them , lol"
13132,"wow , even wild animals , he should have moved to africa ! did you know about the cat cafes in japan ?"
13133,"good point ! ! yeah , what the heck was he thinking ! cat cafes , oh boy ?"
13134,"you pay to play with cats and have drinks . . i would go out of curiosity , what about you ?"
13135,"hmmm , i am allergic to cat so i would run from a place like that . lol . i recently found out that when a cat reached 15 yrs old it has slept 10 years of its life already ."
13136,"wow , they are serous sleepers ! did you know a cat was named mayor in a town of alaska ?"
13137,"haha , no that is weird ! i was able to visit there once its a town called talkeetna , alaska . the cat is named stubbs and it been mayor since 1997 . very remote and odd ."
13138,"wow , so cool you visited there . maybe i am going myself to check it sometime . it is so cool to talk about pets and animals , they are great !"
13139,"yes , thank you for the great chat and have a wonderful rest of your day ."
13140,did you watch the last fifa world cup ?
13141,i didn't want the last one but i saw the one before the last
13142,"i didn't watch the most recent one either , but i read about all the excitement up to france winning ."
13143,usually my family and i watch the fifa wold cup and watch spain
13144,are you a fan of spain's team ?
13145,yes i am . well i'm a little neutral towards them . my family loves the team though .
13146,"i don't know much about the individual teams . does your family have a connection to spain , or did they just end up enjoying that team most ?"
13147,"some of our family used to live in spain , so we just grew up loving the team ."
13148,"that's awesome ! i lived in belgium when i was little . never thought to check if they had a team , though ."
13149,haha nice . yeah so we have been watching them for awhile . i'm not a huge soccer fan though .
13150,"i played soccer when i was little and always liked playing more than watching . i was definitely not world cup material , though ."
13151,"i played soccer as a kid ! i played in high school , but that's all . i'm terrible . but in high school no one got cut haha ."
13152,"i played before high school , so at that age they were pretty soft on us . no one got cut from the team for us either . i think i still have my old soccer uniform shirt ."
13153,nice . do you know who won the world cup last year . i havn't kept up
13154,"i think the last winner was france when they had the tournament in russia . the next one will be in qatar , which ought to be interesting ."
13155,nice . maybe i'll actually watch it this year .
13156,"i don't think it'll be until 2022 , since it's not a yearly tournament ."
13157,lol shows how much i keep up with soccer .
13158,"haha , i'm no expert either . i just figure i'd hear about it in the news a lot more often if it were a yearly thing ."
13159,ahhhh . do they host it in different counties each year ?
13160,"yes , on a bidding system i think . last time russia won , and this time qatar made the winning bid ."
13161,did you watch infinity war ?
13162,i have not yet . i like marvels superheroes but mostly on the netflix series . how about you ?
13163,"i watched it and loved it i also like the netflix series , too bad they got cancelled"
13164,really ? they got cancelled ? i like superhero stories where the stories are focused on one hero . seems like it focuses on many in infinity war .
13165,"yeah they got cancelled its a shame , i really liked them and yeah , marvel has dominated the superhero market for over 10 years , i love the cast , the directors ,"
13166,"i have heard that the villain in the movie is pretty cool , thanos"
13167,"yeah a great villain the hulk had no chance against him , it was humiliating , but no spoilers"
13168,yeah i heard he was much more powerful than the superheroes and it makes the movie different because usually superheros come out on top .
13169,"i like how robert downey jr acts , he is so funny iron man is my favorite hero , do you have a favorite one ?"
13170,"i like the punisher , i think because he doesn't really have out of this world super powers ."
13171,"hat about starlord his another hero without powers , did you watch guardians of the galaxy ?"
13172,i have not watched that yet . i have not even watched black panther which i hear was a big hit ! he's the richest superhero .
13173,"you should really watch that one as well , yeah he has more money than bruce wayne and tony stark combined and then multiplied"
13174,yeah . i thought the script i have seen relating to black panther was made up . it turns out it is based on ancient script .
13175,"it was , wow , that is amazing , the actor of the movie is also really good , chadwick boseman is his name"
13176,i guess he got his break with the help of denzel washington !
13177,"yeah denzel paid for his education , that was a great thing to do , he must be really grateful because of that"
13178,"yes , cool he got to thank denzel in person at the black panther premiere ."
13179,"his role in infinity war was awesome , maybe denzel can become a hero for the franchise one day"
13180,so was there a lot of shawarma eating in infinity war ?
13181,"i think its because of the first movie and the ending scene , heroes gather in a shawarma place ."
13182,do you have a favorite disney movie ?
13183,"too many lol frozen , little mermaid , moana , lion king , aladdin . how about you ?"
13184,"you're right ; it is hard to choose . i do enjoy the movie walle . the name actually comes from walter elias disney , kinda like a nickname of sorts"
13185,"right . that movie was ok , def not my favorite of the disney pixar , i like inside out , monsters inc , toy story and finding nemo ."
13186,"it's still a cute movie though , i wonder if there are any hidden mickey mouse images in it . there's a whole subculture dedicated to finding those easter eggs"
13187,"yeah i know , i have only seen like in disneyland , those things are hard to find ! i sometimes see them in movies but i really like looking for other movie characters in the movies , when they kinda do a special appearance lol"
13188,"did you ever see the movie flubber ? it's been so long since i've seen it that i don't remember much , but bill nye was the science consultant for the movie"
13189,i actually never seen that movie . . any good ?
13190,"it stars robin williams , so you know it's going to be funny . another funny one i like is big hero 6 . they had to use a 55 , 000core supercomputer to render that animation"
13191,that movie was really good too ! i had no idea it was so hard to make .
13192,i know ! minnie mouse is still one of my favorite classic characters though . her name is actually short for minerva mouse . minnie is more catchy if you ask me
13193,"that makes sense , i never knew that . mickey is my favorite . did you hear there is going to be a star wars land in disneyland ?"
13194,that would be so epic ! i would go just for that . it would also be cool to see the headquarters though since it's such a big leader in american animation
13195,yeah i think it will be open in the next year or so . pretty awesome . did you know on the ride pirates of the caribbean there is an actual real human skull ?
13196,"i think i read that in a book recently , actually . i haven't been on that ride yet , but it would be fun to go"
13197,yeah the skull was donated by a school when disneyland first opened . you have never been to disneyland ?
13198,"no , i haven't . i had the choice to a few years ago , but chose to do six flags instead . i also really enjoyed the san diego zoo , especially seeing all the species of birds"
13199,i never been to the san diego zoo but i hear its amazing .
13200,"when i went , there was a peacock walking around among the visitors . i've heard that most birds' feathers weigh more than their bones because their bones are so hollow"
13201,oh wow that is weird lol ugh i cant imagine my bones being hollow .
13202,i also can't imagine what it would be like going without sleep when migrating from alaska to northern mexico
13203,have you been horseback riding ? they are mammals with an odd number of toes .
13204,"yes , i have ! a few times at camp , that's about it though . i've always found them to be fascinating animals though . did you know dalmatians used to protect and calm horses ? that's why they're associated with fire fighters ."
13205,"where did you go to camp ? i went to highlander in nc . we rode normal horses of today , as opposed to 4555 million years ago when they were a small multi toed animal ."
13206,"i went to a special camp in missouri for kids with asthma . all the counselors had ' inhaler ' necklaces just in case . yeah , horse back riding was one of the activities available . it's funny , with all my allergies , i didn't have any problems with the horses ."
13207,clint eastwood was allergic to horses . must have been a pain for all his movie roles with horses .
13208,"he probably had a bunch of allegra or something on set . poor guy ! it's weird , do you know there are horses that are born black and brown but turn completely white about six years in their life ?"
13209,i have heard of them . i believe they are call lipizzaner horses . white horses are rare .
13210,"yeah , i wonder if anyone ever saw one in the forest and though a branch was a horn , thus given birth to the idea of a unicorn ? be an interesting idea to research i think . . ."
13211,i would love to research how nature gave birds the ability to lay hard shelled eggs . they have a high metabolic rate . i assume from the all the exercise of flying .
13212,"yeah , they have all sorts of interesting adaptation for flight . did you know their bones are so hollow that their feathers weigh more than their skeleton ?"
13213,"that blows my mind ! it is unfortunate the dodo bird is extinct , as i would love to see one in person ."
13214,"weird , that it's part of the family of pigeons and extinct , considering how ubiquitous pigeons are in a lot of our major cities !"
13215,pigeons are everywhere in disney . i love visiting and looking for all of the hidden mickey images .
13216,"i've never had the honor of going to any of the disney places , but would love to do so someday . i can't believe how much stuff they own , marvel , star wars , you name it , it's like they're trying to take over the world ! : ,"
13217,you must visit ! it's so fun ! go see minerva ' minnie ' mouse in orlando !
13218,"oh , is that her full name ? i didn't know that ! did you know they named walle as a reference to walter elias disney ?"
13219,that's a sweet shout out to walt . they should name a character after his brother roy too .
13220,"i'm sure they have , somewhere . . . it's amazing to think how far disney has come since it was starting in 1923 . they're even rolling out there own streaming service !"
13221,i hope they show flubber on their streaming service . i love the accuracy due to bill nye's consulting work .
13222,"lots of cgi in that movie . . . speaking of cgi did you know it took a 55 , 000 core supercomputer to render all the artwork in big hero 6 ? makes sense with all the visual effects in that movie !"
13223,that was another great movie . nice chatting with you !
13224,hi . do you enjoy riding horses ? apparently the horse evolved over the past 4555 million years from a small multi toed creature !
13225,"wow thats crazy ! you're right theyve been around for a long time , humans first started domesticating them back in 4000bc"
13226,wow surprising . there are even feral populations of horses but most consider the prezewalski horse the only true wild breed .
13227,"thats interesting , also interesting that clint eastwood was allergic to horses , he rode so many in his career"
13228,oh wow that would make work tough ! highschool students once got suspended for riding their horses to school !
13229,"lol thats funny , i love dalmations and i always wondered by they were associated with firehouses , i guess they would calm the horses down back when firehouses used horses"
13230,yeah that is interesting . i wonder if they calm the icelandic horses who actually have a fifth speed in addition to the 4 that traditional horses have .
13231,"wow thats cool , the extra speed is called the tolt , i wonder why other horses can't move at that speed ?"
13232,yeah good question . i always thought it was funny how horses are afraid of birds . birds are so small and lighttheir bones are even hollow !
13233,that is crazy ! birdsare delicious btw i just ate some chicken ! its amazing that they range in size from 5cm to almost 3 meters !
13234,yeah they come in all shapes ! they can even fly from alaska to mexico without sleeping !
13235,"wow that is a lot of time , can you believe there is a species of bird that uses spiderwebs to make their nests , that is hard core !"
13236,yeah it is . there are even birds in australia who mimic the sound of a camera !
13237,haha i would be more terrified that they can also mimic the sound of a chainsaw ! that would scare me silly at night haha
13238,yes good point ! a lot of birds eat mice . actually minnie mouse is short for minerva mouse !
13239,"wow didn't know that ! i also didnt know that the pigeon is closely related to the dodo bird , maybe we can use them to help us clone dodo birds back into exisitence"
13240,yeah good idea . that would be a funny disney character a dodo bird ! bill nye actually worked with disney on the flubber film !
13241,"haha well thats interesting , did you see the movie big hero 6 ? apprently they created it on a 55 , 000 core computer , which sounds like a supercomputer to me !"
13242,oh wow never seen it but maybe i should ! apparently there are ' hidden mickeys ' in all things disney and there are a lot of people who strive to find them lol !
13243,"haha wow sounds like they have too much time on their hands , also did you know that walle the movie was named after walter elias disney ?"
13244,oh no i didn't no that ! disney has come so far from simply starting as an animation company .
13245,hey there . so i was looking at some info on voting that was pretty interesting
13246,did you vote during the midterms ?
13247,"i did indeed . rather important elections as of late , eh ? did you ?"
13248,i did as well . i was hoping the democrats would have taken the congress too .
13249,"well , they did make inroads and the ones that got in seem to be a fiery progressive bunch . so i have hope . did you know that astronauts get to vote from space ?"
13250,i always wondered how they are able to do that . by what mechanism to they use to cast their secret ballot
13251,"the iss is a heck of a polling station to get to . : , fortunately many methods of collecting votes are allowed"
13252,voter suppression is still an issue in many states and it is frustrating to see what some will do to keep people from voting
13253,it seems like there's only one party that has surpressed voted . they've completely disenfranchised 34 percent of the black male vote in alabama for instance
13254,very sad . suppression was alive and well in georgia and north dakota as well .
13255,"hopefully we keep making progress in congress and turn some of this around . : ,"
13256,i can't believe that the congress is not listening to its voters and holding them hostage with this shutdown
13257,"i'm not surprised that the senate would ignore the will of the people , sadly . i am glad that they are being exposed for doing so more lately , though . we need to have elmo testify before congress again ."
13258,constituents need to contact their congressman at the subway line and have a chat with them on the way to the capitol
13259,"oh , i'm sure they have the subway line well far away from where any constituent could ever reach it . but , i do agree that people need to speak up more . can't keep letting the extremes dictate things just because they're the loudest ."
13260,congress was stating this weekend that they may be close to a deal to reopen government .
13261,house has already passed it . senate and pres are sitting on their hands . won't go anywhere until they cave .
13262,but then we will have to hope the president doesn't change his mind again and signs the bill .
13263,"he'll have to check to see what vladimir putin wants him to do first . i'm sure they'll sort it out . in the meantime , i think everyone blocking progress should have to wear a dunce cap while in session ."
13264,i should start my own fantasy congress league to track the performance a bit closer each week .
13265,my fantasy congress has passed national healthcare and free college . definitely fantasy . : p
13266,"i agree , great platform !"
13267,"i didn't know that astronauts could vote from space , did you ?"
13268,"well , if a chimpanzee can receive enough votes to come in third in a mayoral election , i guess anything is possible ."
13269,that's true . it's also ridiculous that people in austin texas actually voted to have their garbage dump named fred durst .
13270,"i think that's hilarious , and was surprised to learn that jfk voted against the civil rights act ."
13271,"that's pretty surprising since his brother , bobby kennedy , was very procivil rights ."
13272,"they were so different on many things . not surprising , alabama seems to do alabama things , and keep the ban on interracial marriages , even though its uneforceable ."
13273,"yes , it's also surprising to discover that 34 percent of black men don't have the right to vote in alabama . that seems odd ."
13274,is that due to felons not having the right to vote ?
13275,"i'm not sure of the reason . it would seem unlikely that 34 percent of black men in alabama are felons , though . in the uk , all men didn't have the right to vote until 1918 ."
13276,i never knew steven colber went to congress to defend agriculture visas for immigrants .
13277,"i had no idea he did that , either . good for him . i think it is strange that elmo testified before congress ."
13278,ashton kutcher testified before congress a few years ago . he is very involved in stopping sex trafficking .
13279,that's interesting . i wonder how he became involved in that cause . i figured he would be more involved in causes surrounding pediatric heart disease .
13280,"i'm not sure , i think it was a random thing that he found when he was on the night shift when his daughter was a baby ."
13281,"that's interesting . sex trafficking is a big problem around the world . it's something hardly anyone ever discusses , though ."
13282,"it needs more attention , since most of these ' runaway ' girls are probably in the hands of sex traffickers ."
13283,"when i was a kid , i loved to read novels about runaway girls . i'm not sure what my fascination was with it . one of my favorite books in junior high was , ' go ask alice . '"
13284,i've never read them . did you see that facebook was doing psych experiments during the 2010 congressional elections .
13285,nothing surprises me with facebook's activities . i feel like it is all a big mind game . . . trying to ' figure ' people out .
13286,"one would think they would know as much about people by now , as there are many ways to cook an egg , thats what the folds in a chef's hat represent ."
13287,that's funny . i didn't know that . i have a family member who is a sous chef . i will have to impress him with my newfound knowledge .
13288,"i impressed mine when i told her that the fur hats russians were are called ushanka . she didn't know that , and grew up in ukraine ."
13289,thanks for chatting with me this evening .
13290,"hey there ! do you follow politics closely ? i have to for work , but i get sick of it ! it is important to vote though . astronauts even cast votes from space !"
13291,i follow a bit . did you know that us congress has played a republicans vs . democrats baseball game annually since 1909 ?
13292,"yes , i did the practice for that last year was where the shooting of the congressman occurred . sad story , glad he survived ."
13293,"yes , i agree . can you imagine that elmo is the only nonhuman to testify before the us congress ?"
13294,"i find that hysterical ! it is also hilarious that in austin , tx voters changed their garbage dump to be named after fred durst !"
13295,that is crazy ! did you know that indian government sets up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for a single voter ?
13296,every vote counts ! that is why it is sad to here that in alabama 34 percent of the black male population can no longer vote .
13297,that is a shame . i've heard that not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918 !
13298,crazy stuff ! i recently learned there was a fantasy league for congress where players draft congressmen and get points for legislative successes . i cannot even imagine ! ! !
13299,that would actually be pretty fun . there are even three subway lines exclusively for congressmen to move between the capitol and house and senate offices .
13300,very convenient . i cannot imagine the hats they donned in congress back in the late 1700s and early 1800s . i bet they were outlandish !
13301,"i agree . until 1998 , british politicians had to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the house of commons . i wonder if a hat maker made that rule ?"
13302,"haha , keep the profits up ! speaking of hats i think it is funny the most popular hat in the old west was the bowler hat . everyone just assumes it is the cowboy hat , myself included !"
13303,"yes , that is exactly what i would have thought too . i know in the past hats were an indicator of social status ."
13304,i play and watch a lot of golf where tipping the cap is very popular . did you know that tradition dates back to knights ?
13305,"no , i did not , why did they do that ?"
13306,they would raise their face visors to show friendliness .
13307,"oh , that makes sense . did you know there was a law made in 1908 about the length of hat pins ?"
13308,i have heard that before . they though they could be used as weapons right ?
13309,"yes , that is the exact reason . fears that suffragettes would do just that ."
13310,"interesting ! well , it was fun chatting with you today . i learned a lot !"
13311,fun chatting with you as well .
13312,do you know much about governors ?
13313,yes some stuff . do you know what ralph lawrence became famous for ?
13314,yes he opposed the internment of japanese americans during wwii
13315,yeah . did you know texas was one of the first to elect a female governor ?
13316,yes and that was before the 19th amendment was ratified in other states
13317,yeah . do you know the song come together by beatles ?
13318,yes it is a really nice song too . do you know why it was written ?
13319,yes for the governor leary's campaign in california
13320,yeah . did you know the governor of north dakota declared martial law once ?
13321,yes and then they seceded from the us
13322,do you know where schwarzenegger lived when he was governor ?
13323,i know that he did not live in sacramento as he should have
13324,yes and he travelled by plane every day to get to sacramento
13325,"yes and that took 3 hours everyday , what a waste"
13326,i agree . did you know that republican presidents usually have a beard ?
13327,"yes , and since 1853 the president has either been a republican or a democrat"
13328,yeah i guess we really do not hear of other parties
13329,do you know when both parties started using the red and blue colors ?
13330,"yes that was recent actually , since 2000s"
13331,yeah i thought that was always the case with those colors
13332,yes me too . strange . nice chat !
13333,"hi , do you like superhero movies ?"
13334,"i do . i like superheros like batman and superman , but not all of their movies are great like the batman vs superman one"
13335,yeah that is true . did you hear about the batman villain called the condiment king
13336,"just the name tells you they were running out of ideas . for me , joker forever"
13337,yeah it was weird because it defeated itself by slippin on its own ketchup
13338,"i like batman's origin story and i think the dark knight did a good job , though he sounded like he was gargling marbles"
13339,yeah that is true . adam west has a batman logo on his molar
13340,"wow , i never knew he was such a fan . then again , he is the superhero most relatable to us feeble humans in a world of superheroes"
13341,"exactly , good point . do you know where gotham city is located ?"
13342,i think that it is in new jersey right ?
13343,yes it is . joker and batman do not call the name of each other in confrontations
13344,i wonder if that was planned or a coincidence
13345,i have a feeling it is staged . maybe there is a message behind that
13346,"perhaps . contrary to batman , how do you feel about superman ?"
13347,i like the movie actually . do you know how much dc paid to get the right
13348,do you mean the right to the character superman ?
13349,"yes , the right ?"
13350,i think they only paid like a hundred bucks . a real shame for the creators . it is interesting how initially superman was a villain though
13351,yeah something like that and look how much they have made off of that
13352,i wonder how much the exclusive rights for superman would go for today ?
13353,millions i bet . nice chat
13354,do you like ben afflecks back tattoo ? many people are mocking it .
13355,no i do not . ben is a bit weird for me .
13356,"sounds like he was getting treatment for alcohol addiction . hopefully , he recovers ."
13357,"yeah , addiction is never good and i am concerned for his well being too"
13358,i'm surprised his ex drove him to rehab
13359,she is very compassionate person . i've like her for a while . she is a genuine actress too
13360,too bad the paparazzi gets involved in these serious matters .
13361,they truly lack compassion for celebrities
13362,do you remember his relationship with gwyneth paltrow after she got the oscar for shakespeare in love ?
13363,i do . i wonder if he was jealous of her winning the oscar for the award and he got nothing
13364,bennifer was a strange way people described his relationship with jennifer lopez .
13365,"lol . . . true . such a weird , odd couple ."
13366,i wonder how that affected his career when their relationship ended ?
13367,i didn't think it lasted long . his new girlfriend from snl seems to be a good match for him
13368,he did have 3 kids though with garner .
13369,"yeah , that is why i was sad to see them divorce"
13370,they have tried to coparent and have discussed that openly with others . they remain friendly it seems too . i wonder if they will get back together ever .
13371,ben was the worst of the batman actors many believe
13372,i always liked adam west . i never saw his batman log on his molars though lol
13373,he was truly the best as well as michael keaton
13374,"i enjoy the classic actors , especially carol burnett was hilarious . she was the first celebrity to appear on sesame street . superman was a classic too i enjoyed , but i didn't know that the writers came up with the word ' brainiac . ' that's funny ."
13375,"i have yet to see the black panther film , but the facts listed were interesting . i did not know the history behind the film and didn't know it was based on a 4th century script ."
13376,fascinating ! i don't follow movies . i thought it was about the black panthers .
13377,haha ! have you watched disney movies ? my favorite is sleeping beauty and i was disappointed to learn it failed at the box office
13378,"yes , i watched a lot when i was a kid . i prefer the ones with animals . i was interested to learn that the lion king was the first to be dubbed into zulu for its african release . i wonder how it was received there ."
13379,lion king is another one of my favorites . it is always interesting to see how different cultures respond when movies or fashion use their culture for influences .
13380,"yes , it is interesting . did you know that there were a lot of identical scenes in 70s disney movies because they recycled their animation frames ?"
13381,some people have noticed the references and posted about it online . i cannot believe the film wreckitralph which has been out for a few years started in the late 1980's
13382,yes ! it's amazing . i haven't seen it yet .
13383,"i had to do an animation project in a class in college and it took forever but you would think technology would make it a lot faster , as disney has a large studio . i have yet to see the movie"
13384,me too . i wonder what the animation process is like today .
13385,it seems like disney makes or owns all the series or new movies today
13386,"yes , they are one of the ' big six ' ."
13387,do you know the other five of the big six ?
13388,"i don't . i just know that disney has a number of subsidiaries , including pixar , and they work closely with the toy industry during the production process ."
13389,"same , which were stated in the article . the toy industry and companies do a good job of not leaking out the new characters or movies ."
13390,yes . it's amazing considering how many people must be involved .
13391,"sadly , i must admit frozen is another favorite disney movie and was pleased to learn it was directed by a woman ."
13392,yes . i've heard it's good . i've mostly just heard about it from kids so far .
13393,probably the famous let it go song too haha ! it was nice talking to you
13394,you too !
13395,.
13396,"hi , did you watch the black panther ?"
13397,i did ! what do you think about it being shown in saudi arabia
13398,"well , it ended a 35 year movie ban so that is a great thing"
13399,"i agree , it is crazy to think until a few years ago woman could not even drive there ."
13400,yeah that is pretty sexist . did you know black panther is the richest superhero ?
13401,"i did not know that , i bet it would help if he put some money back into the movie industry in america ."
13402,yeah probably . do you know who is the highest box office ranking actor ?
13403,i do not know . who is it ?
13404,"tom hanks , he is great"
13405,"i agree , so many great films over the years"
13406,disney once wanted to shut down the studio after sleeping beauty flopped
13407,"i am glad they didn't , do you remember john carter ?"
13408,hmmm who is that ?
13409,"it was a flop movie in the states from disney but in russia of all places , it broke box office records ."
13410,wowww interesting . have you seen the lion king ?
13411,i have it is a classic !
13412,yes it is . it was the first disney movie to be dubbed in zulu
13413,"that is interesting , disney is a trendsetter . did you know they use multiplane camera to make older films like bambi more realistic ?"
13414,wow did not know that . have you seen frozen ?
13415,i have not seen frozen yet .
13416,it is a good one . nice chat
13417,"hello , did you watch black panther ?"
13418,i haven't seen it . he is the richest superhero with an estimated worth of 500 billion .
13419,"yeah that is crazy , i guess that makes sense though , he owns a country lol"
13420,true ! he beat out tony stark and bruce wayne !
13421,yeah that is quite an inheritance !
13422,did you know that the symbols and written script in black panther are based on an actual script calleed nsibdi .
13423,"that is very interesting , i did not know that . amazing !"
13424,i am amazed that tom hanks is the highest alltime box office star . he has earned over 8 . 5 billion worldwide in film earnings . amazing .
13425,"i am not . he has done so much over the years . almost all his movies are a hit , i actually can't even think of one bad movie he has done lol did you know that he doesn't take any bad guy roles ?"
13426,i could see that . he is so likable ! did you ever see the movie treasure planet by disney . it was the worst ever . it was also one of the most expensive flop of all time .
13427,"wow , never saw it . can't believe there are disney movies that didn't make money lol"
13428,i know ! frozen was the first disney film directed by a woman . i would have figured it would have happened before that !
13429,"that is weird . a lot of the disney movies have women leads too lol that movie was really good , frozen"
13430,i liked it too . especially surprising because walt disney pictures is regarded as one of hollywood's big six film studios .
13431,"i believe it , children make parents spend lots of money ! lol"
13432,"exactly , case in point , the toy industry gets involved in disney animations even before the beginning of film production . lots of money to be made !"
13433,"yeah , seriously , before a movie comes out my kids are asking for toy characters i never even heard of !"
13434,mine too ! they sure can make a ton of different toys with all the characters that are in these movies .
13435,"yeah , i admit i like a lot of disney stuff too , not the toys but some collectables . disney is smart that way though , aim for the kids first lol"
13436,yes . . . and the adults will follow . they once considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty failed . can you imagine if they did ?
13437,"no i can't imagine that one movie flop will bring that whole company , even at the time of sleeping beauty lol its been really good chatting !"
13438,did you watch the movie black panther ?
13439,"yes it was a decent film . i generally enjoy the quality of recent marvel superhero films and it had a high quality cast as well . did you know black panther , the superhero , is estimated to be worth 500 billion ?"
13440,"wow , i thought tony stark was the richest of them all , that is interesting , well he is like the president of wakanda ."
13441,"regardless , it is impressive enough that superheros such as stark , wayne , and black panther is worth billions !"
13442,"yeah , i thought wayne was the richest of them all and turns out he has an 80 billion worth , black panther was called black leopard at some point"
13443,"well if you are that rich , you can spend without thinking about expenses so after a point , they are just amazingly rich period . furthermore , black panther is also unique in that it will end the 35year ban saudi arabia previously enacted ."
13444,"yeah , i heard they had a strict ban due to religious reasons , women couldn't drive until after 2017 ."
13445,this change could reflect the changing socioeconomic climate in saudi arabia as the crown prince mohammed bin salam wants to brand himself as a social modernizer while consolidating power .
13446,"im just glad i live in america , so many issues in other countries , one thing is certain , that disney and marvel are the big winners here ."
13447,"indeed , american movie studios like disney and marvel require foreign markets for growth and this recent change benefits them substantially ."
13448,"they sure are kicking dcs behind , the international box for that movie was around 29 . 5 billion dollars"
13449,"dc did well on wonder woman and the dark knight , but recent movies like batman vs superman or green lantern weren't the best ."
13450,"i loved the batman trilogy and i agree with you , dc hasn't made good movies lately , i wonder how much their box office was ."
13451,"too bad the box office doesn't necessary represent how good the movie is . for instance , disney's well known sleeping beauty was considered a box office failure ."
13452,"i didnt know that ! its one of the most popular movies now , tom hanks is the highest box office star of all time ."
13453,i recently read he made over 8 . 5 billion in film earnings . he is a good actor .
13454,"i think he is a good actor as well , do you like walt disney pictures ?"
13455,i feel that walt disney does a good job of refining old fairy tales to be more kid friendly . they have also produced many popular films like lion king or frozen .
13456,"i agree , did you know that frozen is the fist animated film with a woman as a director ."
13457,i also only recently read about that . disney does a good job of producing high quality products and generating revenue through various different revenue streams such as with the toy industry .
13458,i know ! it seems unreal how the toy industry is behind the productions
13459,are you a comic fan . i love batman . he is a dc superhero .
13460,"yes , i agree . so i guess you watched ' batman v superman : dawn of justice ' , right ? did you like it ?"
13461,"not really , i was disappointed in it . did you know that batman had a advisory called condiment king . he was defeated by slipping on his own ketchup ."
13462,"no , i didn't know . i also didn't know there is a silver coin with superman on the heads side . this is legal tender in canada ."
13463,"cool , i need one of those . adam west , who played batman has the batman"
13464,do i understand correctly that the first time superman as superhero was published in a comic book in 1938 ?
13465,"yes , it was . i was saying he has a batman logo on a molar . also gotham city is supposed to be located in new jersey ."
13466,true . i didn't know that there was a version of superman created where superman was raised in ussr . i'm wondering what was an idea behind that .
13467,i read that comic . in the most recent dc animated film ' batman vs robin ' weird al did some voiceover work .
13468,really ? it sounds like a lot of fun .
13469,"yes , and pays great i'm sure . changing topics , pixar studio has a secret room that celebrities visit ."
13470,"well , i didn't know , but i'm not surprised . it's easy to imagine ."
13471,"also , i cant believe that judge judy makes 123 , 000 per episode ."
13472,"i won't pay so much . in my opinion , it's very very average work and nothing special there ."
13473,what ? ? ? that amount makes her the second highest paid celebrity . lebron james is first .
13474,"yes , i know about lebron james . btw , did you know that jenna marble makes over 300k annually on youtube channel ? i'm wondering how much people make on youtube in general ."
13475,i am not sure . i did know that the first celebrity to appear on sesame street was carol burnett .
13476,"yes , i remember i watched it with my nephew . sesame is good ."
13477,"yes . i will leave you with this . going back to superman , the actor henry cavill , who currently plays superman , almost missed the call for the role because he was playing ' world of warcraft ' ."
13478,ok . thanks . have a good day !
13479,thanks
13480,"hello , let's have conversation about snake eyes"
13481,i would love too .
13482,did you know that dawn moreno is the new snake eyes in idw's ' g . i . joe ?
13483,"no , i had not realized that ."
13484,"yes and also larry hama has been writing ' g . i . joe : a real american hero ' comics since the series' days at marvel comics , which is interesting to learn"
13485,snake eyes is one of the more popular characters among fans .
13486,"yes exactly , both in the comics and in various animated series and even the ' g . i . joe ' liveaction movies , do you agree ?"
13487,i am glad more females are playing characters . are you watching the movie now ?
13488,"yes i like to watch , ' the best we can do is give something a good shot and throw it out there , and see if it flies , ' hama said , what do you think ?"
13489,the female characters have brought new life into many of the storylines .
13490,"yes i totally agree with you , let's discuss snakes"
13491,"i never really liked snakes myself , i was too scared of them ."
13492,"i am afraid of them too they are awful , but did you know like all squamates , snakes are ectothermic , amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales ?"
13493,they are the legless wonders of the world thats for sure .
13494,did you know that many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors ?
13495,i did not realize that . do you own a snake ?
13496,"no of course no lol , areb you aware that there are no snakes in new zealand ?"
13497,"no , i was not aware of that . what is causing the delay on your end ?"
13498,"yes i think , do you like comic books ?"
13499,i really like marvel and dc comics for gi joe .
13500,it was nice to chat to you
13501,hi what do you think of snakes ?
13502,"hello , i am not a fan but know some stuff about them . there are none of them in nz"
13503,that is pretty neat . did you know crocodiles have more in common n with birds than snake ?
13504,hmm interesting . there is a genius of them than kind of fly and launch onto the prey
13505,wow that just sounds scary . our fear of snaked is hard wired in our brains and those of monkeys
13506,i guess it makes sense since we see them as evil and dangerous
13507,yeah exactly . there are lizards without limbs but that are not snakes
13508,wow there is everything out there it seems . do you like comic books at all ?
13509,i do sometimes . do you know how stan lee finished his phone calls ?
13510,"haha the legend did so with excelsior , such a funny guy"
13511,yeah i know . did you hear how marvel trademarked superhero and supervillain ?
13512,oh yeah they published a generic comic book with those name . genius if you ask me
13513,very much so . do you know what dc stands for ?
13514,yeah it stands for detective comics so it is pretty redundant
13515,yeah that it is . do you know which library ha the largest collecting of comic books ?
13516,i think it is the msu library . i wish i could go and check it out
13517,me too . did you know that sony owns the rights to spiderman ?
13518,yeah they bought it from marvel back in the day and they could have bought the others too but passed on that
13519,yeah they thought only spiderman was going to be popular and paid the 10 million for it
13520,"yeah , still got that one . have you heard of he superhero access ?"
13521,"yes i have , he is the guy that keeps the balance between dc and marvel"
13522,"hello , do you like snakes ? i am afraid of them , really afraid"
13523,"i actually love snakes lol , i just think their narrow bodies are pretty cool and they scare everyone"
13524,"i want to move to new zealand , i heard theres no snakes over tehre"
13525,not only in new zealand but ireland has no snakes too
13526,"another great place to go then , i hear there are also flying snakes"
13527,i
13528,would that make you afraid ?
13529,"they sound pretty scary , i've never heard of flying snake but it's pretty cool they can launch at prey"
13530,you know the fear of snakes is not only hardwired in our brains but also in the brains of monkeys
13531,i heard not only the fear of snakes is hard wired but of spiders too
13532,"spiders are scary too , enough about those scary creatures do you like comic books ?"
13533,"i like marvel comics , i'm surprised they are only the 3rd largest comic book publisher"
13534,the 3rd largest really ? i know dc is on top but what other company is there
13535,i guess the japanese manga company viz media distributes more
13536,"it does ? that is suprising havent heard of that one before , just like the superhero blue ear"
13537,"have you heard of access , the only shared superhero between dc and marvel ?"
13538,"no , what are her supper powers ? or her purpose ?"
13539,access only purpose is to keep the dc and marvel universes apart
13540,"oh i see , i bet she is really powerful still , do you like marvel comics or dc comics better ?"
13541,i prefer marvel comics and their earth 616 universe
13542,"i do too , besides their movies are way better"
13543,are you a big fan of star wars ?
13544,i am a fan of the originals . i heard solo barly made 100 mil on memorial day weekend
13545,yep bombed big time ! they said female characters were underused .
13546,they say that but they dont see the trend of movies with female leads tanking . the movie cost upward of 200 million to make and i dont see it
13547,they say the new generation has moved toward movies like black panther and get out .
13548,yeah they say little boys would never identify with a female superheros . maybe it is not the superhero but the poor actress or writings fault ?
13549,perhaps . ron howard directed the movie but i guess great directors have flops too .
13550,"' a quiet place , ' john krasinski's 17 million directorial debut , has become a global juggernaut , . i think it was ok but it was not original ."
13551,"he's moving on up in the world . he was on the office , right ?"
13552,"yeah he was tim or ted or whatever it was . in 2013 , star wars was dubbed in navajo so it is nice they get to hear it in their language"
13553,true . i read somewhere that black panther was the richest superhero . .
13554,i guess but he is by far one of the worst . black panther was not named after the black panther party like most people believe
13555,whose your favorite superhero ?
13556,sadly we will never get a real superhero movie because of how they sold charecters off . but the true story of thanos not the one in the movie is one that will make you question if he is bad .
13557,i'll have to read up on that . my favorite was bruce wayne aka batman . the older movies of course . they say he's the 3rd richest superhero .
13558,tony stark is worth 100 billion if i remember right .
13559,that's iron man ?
13560,yeah he is iron man . and the book you want to look for is called thanos quest .
13561,is that the name of the popular reddit account ? now this all makes a bit of sense . i
13562,im not sure about that . it was the story about him search for the stones . marvel censored m'baku's utterance of ' praise hanuman ! ' in indian releases of black panther . i guess they did not want to offend
13563,we live in a different world now .
13564,"hey there , did you ever watch star wars ?"
13565,"hi ! yes , i've see all the star wars movies , i was a contributor to the 100 million opening box office revenue on opening weekend . do you watch star wars ?"
13566,"yes me too , it is really good . it is so popular it was even dubbed in navajo ."
13567,"it took them a long time , but i wonder why they chose to do that . guess how much james earl jones made for his work on recording all of darth vadar's lines for the franchise"
13568,was it a lot ? 20th century fox even thought it was going to flop altogether .
13569,"he made 7500 , but it only took him 2 . 5 hours to do all of the recordings ! that's not a bad payday , especially if he also gets other revenues from licensing and merchandise and dvds !"
13570,"oh nice , they that is true all the money on the side . george lucas made so much money because of it because he convinced the studio to keep the licensing and merchandising right to himself for a small fee ."
13571,genius ! it's crazy to think that he believed in himself so much when no one else did and look at how much it paid off ! he's a billionaire now because of his creativity ! but his wife was also a reason for the major changes in the original star wars film and she even won an academy award for editing the film !
13572,you never know right ? they made such a good team in that sense . isaac apparently asked that his character be a native of planet yavin 4 because it was filmed in guatelama and he is from there .
13573,"they really do , if they divorce , it sure would be a costly one . oh i didn't know that about isaac . i actually really like marvel films too , especially the black panther film , my children imitate the x ' wakanda ' sign at home all the time ."
13574,"that movie has been such a huge one , really . it is the richest superhero too ."
13575,oh really ? i would've thought that tony stark from iron man was the richest character .
13576,he much but rich but not that rich . did you know that scripts and symbols in the movie date back to 4th century ?
13577,"wow , i didn't know that . i wonder how they came up with all those interesting names of the characters . marvel had to censor m'baku's chant in india because they feared that a character or villain praising a hindu god would lead to backlash"
13578,"how about disney , do you know the real name of minnie mouse ?"
13579,"no , what is the real name of minnie mouse ? i love disney , especially pixar movies . do you ?"
13580,her name is minerva mouse . i wonder who came up with that name . yeah me too .
13581,"that's an odd name , i wonder if any parents named their children after the characters . i had no idea that disney hides mickey mouses in their disney things and there even a whole subculture dedicated to that . kind of like the stan lee signature at disney theem parks ."
13582,yeah that is really strange . did you watch walle ?
13583,"i did see that movie and disney really has established itself as the leader in the animation industry and its also present in their film production , television , and theme parks !"
13584,very true . it was names as such as a tip fp the hat to walter elias disney .
13585,"oh ok , i didn't know that atandt owned walt disney studios because they own nbc and warner media . is that true ?"
13586,"i did not know that either , that is pretty cool . it was nice chatting with you ."
13587,hello .
13588,hello .
13589,"so , did you see solo ?"
13590,yes . i believe there was much missed opportunity in the film .
13591,same here . i didn't like how they changed the character of han solo . it didn't line up with how he was in the original trilogy .
13592,agreed . the actor lacked too many of the inherent qualities harrison ford brought to the role .
13593,"i thought so , too . i knew it would be different because it wasn't harrison ford . nothing against the actor in solo . i thought parts of the storyline were ok , but it seemed really formulaic at times ."
13594,the studio really needed to reevaluate and reinvent more for this film .
13595,"i agree . it seems they just thought ' well , it's star wars , just throw in whatever has worked in the past and people will pay to see it . '"
13596,"yes . it seems like the most successful movies now are the innovative , new ones ."
13597,exactly . did you see ' a quiet place ' ? i really liked that one .
13598,"i am going to see it this week , actually . looking forward to contrasting it with other suspense films ."
13599,"i think you'll like it . it's very different than most other films . i won't spoil the story for you , but , most of the dialogue in the film is done with american sign language , with screen captions , ."
13600,great . i do think that audiences really appreciate unique films presented by innovators more than ' widget ' based blockbusters .
13601,"i think they do . i remember the first ' paranormal activity ' film . say what you will about the mediocre sequels , but the first was very inventive . even if ' found footage ' films had been done before ."
13602,"yes , i think there is plenty of room in the marketplace for more originals and less sequels ."
13603,"true . however , with disney about to own fox , i'm skeptical that will happen ."
13604,that is true . although they do manage to produce a lot of innovative ideas . they just overcycle them too often .
13605,i didn't see black panther . was it any good ?
13606,"i have yet to see it , but the reviews seem promising . i have it on my list . the sociopolitical overtones seem to be played up by many reviews ."
13607,"well , i have to get going . but , it's been nice talking to you ."
13608,it has been very nice . enjoy your day .
13609,goodbye
13610,"hi , how are you ?"
13611,"good . did you see the new star wars sequel , solo ? i heard it tanked at the box office ."
13612,i watched a little of it on netflix but not the whole thing yet . i usually save movies for the gym when i am on the treadmill . have you seen it ?
13613,"no . i have it on my list of movies to watch , right after the other star wars movie released just before solo , the last jedi ."
13614,i saw that they just released that on netflix . i may not finish solo and just go to the last jedi . i think that got better reviews . . .
13615,"with a measely 100 mil on opening weekend , solo fell under harsh criticism . i think it was destined to suffer some because harrison ford , the original hans solo , was so beloved ."
13616,100m is struggling to squeak by ? imagine if it was good ? i think disney did too many too quick and saturated the market when it wasn't needed .
13617,"agreed . give me 100 million for one weekend , and i would be happy with a flop too . of course , solo came out so close to avengers : infinity wars and deadpool2 that it may still do well over the long haul ."
13618,yeah . i wonder what it cost to make that movie ? do you think it was worth their time and resources ?
13619,i heard it cost about 200 million to make and another140 mil to promote . they could have done better if they just bought everyone free tickets .
13620,i just read that star wars was the first major fild to be dubbed in a native american language . that's cool .
13621,"nice . i remember when the original star wars came out , everyone in my class talking about it and seeing it like10 times before it left town , and now the average classroom of students barely noticed this prequel was even out ."
13622,"yeah . i do feel like episode 1 , the 4th one , was really anticipated . i also know that jar jar binx killed the movie . . ."
13623,"the binxinator , killing sequels . . . i wonder if george lucas , the original director , had anything to do with that ."
13624,"i hope not , i think he has more sense than that but who know . he made a lot of money selling to disney though . . ."
13625,like he needed more money . did you know that he originally negotiated to forego his directing fee in order to retain merchandising and and licensing rights . 20th century fox choked big on that move .
13626,i didn't know that . did you know minnie mouse is short for minerva mouse ?
13627,"met her at a party once . she had a serious addiction to helium as i recall . got it from mickey . another actor with a funny voice , r2d2 . lucas said r2d2 was the one who first told the sage story some hundrend years after it's occurrence ."
13628,ha ! nice . did you know walle was named after aleter elias disney ? i had no idea !
13629,i noticed the family resemblance . disney is a funny place . did you know that the disney channel never advertising shows other than their own ?
13630,i did not ! nice chatting with you !
13631,have you read the article ' how to spot gays checklist ' ?
13632,i'm reading it now . isn't that terrible ?
13633,i'm quite shocked and a bit disgusted ! i would think that malaysia is a conservative country ! what do you think would happen if that were to be published in the us ?
13634,terrible things i'm sure . thank god we are no longer that backwards .
13635,"yeah , i think there might also be a lot of lawsuits and a social media outcry of that . it also reminds me of the actor who staged his own hate crime for fame , quite surprised , did you hear about that ?"
13636,i did . it's unfortunate that he used being gay against himself . in malaysia an 18 year old was beaten and burned because he was gay .
13637,"it's terrible for that actor to take advantage of people's empathy and the forwards environment we live in today ! on a lighter subject , i enjoy disney films , i think frozen is my favorite and it was the first film directed by a woman . have you seen it ?"
13638,i've seen parts of it . i heard the disney movie beauty and the beast was banned in malaysia because of a gay scene . what scene could possibly be considered gay ?
13639,"wow and yet they allow the publication of a ' how to ' article ? i'm not sure which scene would be considered gay and offensive . i didn't know jackie chan sang in that film , does that mean he was the beast ?"
13640,i don't know ! i didn't even know jackie chan could sing !
13641,"george r . r . martin wrote fourteen episodes of the beauty and the beast series in the late 80s . i didn't even know there was a tv series , have you seen it ?"
13642,no ! i had no idea ! did you know that a mogul of bullet proof clothing shoots all his employees to test the garments ? i would not want to work there !
13643,"what ? ! that's crazy ! i think that definitely falls under workplace harassment ! i wonder if the roles are vice versa , can the development team also test it on others ?"
13644,no idea ! that is so crazy ! did you also know that greeks made their clothes out of asbestos ? oh my gosh !
13645,"i don't think i see any benefit for making clothes out of asbestos , speaking of asbestos , i just paid a lot of money to get rid of asbestos in my old house ! oh boy am i glad we are much more forwards than other places !"
13646,me too . i used to do hvac and would not accept a job if there was asbestos to be removed . i just wasn't equipped . a man once wore 70 items of clothes to not pay a baggage charge at an airport .
13647,"oh my goodness ! that's really commendable for you to turn down jobs like that because health is more important ! but i do worry that when they removed it , it seeped into the carpets since i had a local guy do it for a lot less . lol , that's hilarious , i've tried layering up for the winter and can't move my limbs with just five layers !"
13648,"i know ! and most of your clothes actually fit , so it wasn't like he could pick bigger items to wear ! did you know people used to use old faithful to wash their clothes ? and vacuum alot . it will help get it out of the carpets ."
13649,"yeah exactly ! i think i would get a very great laugh if i saw that at the airport , wonder if there's any laws or fines that detail that . i'd have to try that and steam clean the carpets too ! there's a store in alabama that sells items found in unclaimed baggage at airports ! why would anyone not claim their baggages ? !"
13650,maybe distance would keep them from claiming it ? it would be fun to shop there though ! have you ever been ?
13651,"i'd imagine people carry important things or souvenirs and airlines would send the luggages to them if they lost it . i have never shopped there , but would be interested in seeing what's there , maybe i can find cheap electronics at a discount , i wonder how much they sell it for relative to market price ."
13652,hi ! did you see the new beauty and the beast !
13653,"not yet , but it is a favorite classic ! i love the clothes they wear in it . i love that the beast wears clothes even though clothes are usually for humans ."
13654,"yeah . i am excited to see it . i remember loving the cartoon . alan menken composed the music , he also did the little mermaid and many other disney films ."
13655,i heard bill condon directed the 2017 film that was coproduced by disney .
13656,did you know jackie chan provided the speaking voice for the beast in the chinese versions ?
13657,"no , i did not ! i have heard that the 2017 remake had an estimated budget of 255 million !"
13658,"wow , i heard that celine dion was reluctant to sing the theme , but it launched into stardom"
13659,i did not know she was in it . i don't care for her voice . no wonder the budget was so high . it is one of the most expensive films ever made .
13660,that was probably for the cartoon version years ago . then titanic . i think she is more famous for that than anything .
13661,"no , it was for the remake . the film received generally favorable reviews , and many said it stayed true to the original ."
13662,that is good . i mean it is classic disney .
13663,"yes , for sure . the film grossed over 1 . 2 billion worldwide , becoming the highest grossing live action musical film of 2017 ."
13664,that is pretty incredible . george rr martin . wrote 14 episodes of the beauty and the beast series for ron pearlman and linda hamilton
13665,"oh , i didn't know . i know back in the 70's walt disney used to recycle a lot of their animation frames which resulted in identical scenes in some movies ."
13666,"ive heard that , i guess ive recognized some things"
13667,i do love disney . did you know that the disney movie frozen was the first disney animation directed by a woman ?
13668,"i heard that . that is shocking ! i loved that movie , there is going to be a sequel too !"
13669,"i just heard ! i wonder how long it has been in the making ? i know wreck it ralph's animation spanned nearly three decades , starting in the late 1980's !"
13670,"that really surprised me , that is a long time to work on a film , i wonder how long the toy industry had to wait to release what they started to make ,"
13671,"i am not sure , but i know the toy industry gets involved before film production even begins . nice chatting !"
13672,you too have a great day !
13673,do you happen to enjoy tennis ?
13674,"hello , i love tennis . what about you ?"
13675,i like tennis . did you know that polo shirts were originally invented for tennis ?
13676,"i had no idea , but i love wearing polo shirts . do you wear them ?"
13677,i did for a job but not in quite a while . did you also know that a black man won the first us open title ?
13678,i did not know that . looks like a black man hasn't won since then .
13679,that is correct . did you also know that in 1968 they used a helicopter to dry the court grass ?
13680,wow i didn't know that . very smart idea . the longest match in history went 11 hours .
13681,how on earth could you play that long ? i would be insanely exhausted and unable to move my arm the next day .
13682,i would be exhausted too . do you like serena williams ?
13683,i do . she is an amazing player .
13684,she's very good . i saw she can speak french and italian .
13685,i did not know that . i did know that she coowns the miami dolphins .
13686,sounds like she has a lot of money lol . she has won 23 grand slam tournaments .
13687,yes she does . she is very talented . this is off topic but do you like comedy ?
13688,i love comedy . do you ?
13689,i love it as well . are you familiar with demetri martin ? he is a standup comedian .
13690,i'm not too familiar with him . is he pretty funny ?
13691,he is . he is also very smart . he was accepted into harvard law but left to pursue his comedy career .
13692,wow very cool . i saw ryan stiles dropped out of high school to pursue a career in comedy .
13693,he's funny . i remember him on who's line is it anyway . it was nice chatting with you . have a good day .
13694,"hi ! have you ever wondered what our world would be like today if hilary clinton had won ? better or worse ? i know ts hard to say especially after the scandal . atleast she has been consistent in politics , did you know she was president for young republicans in college ?"
13695,"no , i don't pay that much attention to politics . i'm not surprised that she was a republican at one point ."
13696,"i try not to either , as of late it's been all over the place . yes , infact hilary has been campaigning for a while she even campaigned in the south , and while there she adopted a southern drawl . shes full of surprises ."
13697,well if we were in india we could go to the polls in a forest !
13698,interesting ! i guess even if we tried to get out in space we could still vote from there . . . no excuses !
13699,hilarious ! did you know people in austin tx named one of their dumps after fred durst ?
13700,"interesting , no i did not know . i love fun facts ! i guess its better than what alabama is going through 34 percent of black make population has permanently lost the right to vote . i thought that was illegal ."
13701,"interesting , is this current day ? i cannot believe that ."
13702,i haven't heard any updates . it'll be interesting to follow up . im glad the uk has come a long way since up to 1918 not all men could vote .
13703,"yeah , seems sort of weird , but then again the monarchy is hard to follow ."
13704,"its true , well not to mention that since the 1900 , the taller candidate has won the presidential elections 75 percent of the time"
13705,"yeah , i've heard about that . i bet that goes into the vegas odds ."
13706,"you know , going back to hilary clinton , i think she was a great role model . or or she always gets me when she talks about daughters and fathers . she talks to young women and reminds them they can be anything they want to be , including the president of the united states ."
13707,interesting . apparently while campaigning in the south she would adopt a southern drawl .
13708,she had a facination that women who were the first born had a father could easily pursuade his vote versus having a son first .
13709,interesting . did you know stephen hawking used to lecture at the white house ?
13710,"no i didn't , i don't doubt it , he was amazing ."
13711,"yeah , too bad he passed away a few years back ."
13712,"its unfortunate , he was brilliant . just like hillary clinton speech , when she won the grammy for best spoken word album for the audio recording of her book ' it takes a village '"
13713,interesting . i didn't know she won a grammy .
13714,"she is very accomplished , not only did she win a grammy , she is a politician , diplomat , lawyer , writer and public speaker , shes impressive . how did she maintain a family , that's what i want to know , i can barely get up in the mornings ."
13715,i'm not sure . but it was nice chatting with you !
13716,nice chatting with you too ! good night !
13717,do you like the sun ? i can't get enough of it . haha
13718,the sun is a good thing to have . it seems in short supply . unlike authors who display their family problems .
13719,i agree lol . the suns diameter is 109 times the size of earth !
13720,"the sun is big then . with a mass of 330 , 000 times the earth , i bet the sun weighs a good percentage of the solar system ."
13721,it accounts for 99 . 86 of the total mass of the solar system ! lolol
13722,"if anyone would write a book about the sun , it would not be kathryn harrison . her stories are all about the crazy family she grew up in . not science at all ."
13723,i am not familiar with her . what are some of her stories ?
13724,"an older book by here is ' the kiss ' . apparently she had a in appropriate relation with her father . apparently the diameter of the sun is 1 . 39 million km . i would hate to drive around the sun , it would take forever ."
13725,i will have to look her up . did you know that the sun is really white ?
13726,"yes , white . we see the sun as yellow or red because of the atmosphere of earth ."
13727,interesting . a lightening bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun . 5 times hotter !
13728,i wonder who they got to hold the thermometer . i am willing to bet the surface of the sun is one temperature and its a bit warmer a few thousand km inside .
13729,"hahaha it also produces enough energy in 1 second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500 , 000 years . no idea how they could possibly know that ."
13730,"the needs of the people on the planet , or the needs of the planet . seems to me a planet dose not need to be plugged in ."
13731,yes ! lol the sun even though seems big to us is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy .
13732,an i thought the sun had a weight problem accounting 99 . 86 percent of the solar system . i guess there is more out there than just us .
13733,do you have a choice between fiction or nonfiction ? i tend to lean towards being interested in things that are nonfiction .
13734,"yes , nonfiction for me . think about neptune , it is so far away it took 165 years to travel around the sun once . thats good non fiction there ."
13735,i wonder what the atmosphere would be like because of that ? the biggest selling nonfiction book of all time is the bible !
13736,cold . i bet neptune is cold . winter is coming after all . takes 165 years for a seasonal cycle . george rr martin needs to get to the point .
13737,lol yes he does ! it was fun chatting with you ! have a good rest of the day !
13738,"i had no idea that the sun was really white , did you ?"
13739,"i had read that somewhere , it's only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering ."
13740,sounds good . do you know who kathrine harrison is ?
13741,"i have heard of her , did she write ' the kiss ? '"
13742,yes she wrote the kiss as well as several other novels . this i hear appears to be her more controversial one .
13743,"that's cool , any idea what this one is about ?"
13744,this one is about an affair she had in her early 20's . have you heard of any other's of her works ?
13745,"i have not . i just read ' the kiss ' by happenstance , i like reading fiction books mostly . did you know there's a wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities ?"
13746,i did not know that . i did not know she wrote joan of arc . i've seen the movie and it was really good .
13747,"i didn't know she wrote that . i haven't seen the movie yet , i've heard it was good ."
13748,very ! did you know that lighting bolts are 5x hotter than the sun ?
13749,that's hot ! i've heard that the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy .
13750,"man when you think how small we are in the universe . the sun even produces enough energy in one second to take care of the planet for 500 , 000 years ."
13751,"it is astonishing . did you know that on july 11 , 2011 , neptune completed it's first full orbit around the sun since its discovery in 1846 ?"
13752,wow that's a long time . so is the sun in the center of our galaxy or solar system ?
13753,it's the center of the solar system i believe .
13754,"oh ok i always get those mixed up , lol ! have you read any of edger allen poe's work ?"
13755,"i have , i really like poe . did you know that he wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction ?"
13756,wow that sounds like something way before his time . have you read that one ?
13757,i believe it was ' the man that was used up ' if i'm not mistaken .
13758,wow . did you know that julius caesar wrote fan fiction ?
13759,i had heard that he did in his youth .
13760,his fiction was about hercules and oedipus .
13761,that's pretty neat . well i have to get going . i hope you have a great day !
13762,you too thanks !
13763,goodbye !
13764,hello my friend do you like watching sunrises ?
13765,i do ! do you ?
13766,"yes i do , crazy that the sun is actually white when viewed in space !"
13767,are you a kathryn harrison fan ?
13768,"cant say i am , who is she ?"
13769,she produced 7 transportive novels and 8 books of nonfiction .
13770,do you like fiction ? i guess edgar allen poe wrote fiction about a cyborg once
13771,i did not ! very interesting .
13772,"ya , fiction is apparently created from your imagination and is not based on history or fact , so its crazy he came up with the idea of a cyborg"
13773,did you know helium is the only element to be discovered on the sun before it was discovered on earth ?
13774,"no that is wild , i also didn't know tht a bolt of lightning is five times hotter than the sun !"
13775,thats hot ! the sunset on mars is blue ! i want to see that .
13776,"i do too ! also , the sun makes enough energy in 1 second to power us for 500 , 000 years , we need to harness that !"
13777,"seriously , that is amazing . the sun makes up 99 . 86 percent of our solar systems mass ."
13778,yup and it is only about a billionth the size of the biggest star yet discovered ! so pretty small compared to that
13779,very fascinating its mass is 330000 times earths mass
13780,its crazy to that its diameter is 109x wider than the earth as well
13781,absolutely amazing . the earth is so small in comparison .
13782,"ya , did you know that caesar wrote fan fiction of oedipus and hercules , thats funny to me"
13783,i did not . that is funny .
13784,do you ever watch game of thrones at al ? written by george rr martin ?
13785,i could never get into it although i watched the first 3 episodes like 5 times each .
13786,"ya well that guy apparently thinks fan fiction is dumb and should be illegal , i think caesar would beg to differ ahha"
13787,did you know a 'drabble' is a work of fiction exactly 100 words long ?
13788,"haha nope never knew that , also didn't know gwb read 14 biographies of lincoln"
13789,fascinating ! it was nice chatting with you by the way .
13790,thanks have a great day and keep reading nonfiction !
13791,haha will do !
13792,gwb also read 186 historical non fiction books
13793,hi there ! looking forward to chat with you !
13794,good morning ! did you know there's a state with a ' none of these candidates ' option on their ballots ?
13795,"lol ! ; , so why would anybody leave house if there is no vote given ; ,"
13796,"maybe they would vote on some of the items on the ballot but not others , or tell their friends they were voting for one candidate but actually vote for none ."
13797,"lol ; , shady bastards : , i actually don't care what my friends think of me , i always say who i'm voting for ; ,"
13798,that's very honest of you . did you know that voter turnout for presidential elections hasn't risen above 62 . 8 percent in the last 100 years ?
13799,"i guess people don't believe they can make a change . . . and probably for the past 100 years no bog change was made : ,"
13800,"that and it's harder for some people to vote because of transportation , work schedules , child care and other responsibilities ."
13801,that's right . . . . hey why can't they make it online ? i'm sure frequency would improved . . .
13802,"yes , but it would be harder to avoid voter fraud ."
13803,"i don't know . . . i mean those voted are going into the computer anyway . . . but first people are counting it . . . so there are two margins or error or fraud : ,"
13804,"did you know that in 2012 , international election observers were blocked from the polls in nine states ?"
13805,blocked ? do you know why ?
13806,no . i'm not sure . did you know that 34 percent of black men in alabama have permanently lost the right to vote ?
13807,"what , like in today's times ? what did they do to deserve that ?"
13808,"probably felony convictions , which is unsettling when you think about how some groups of people are more often charged with crimes whereas others get away with the same things ."
13809,"you're probably right , but i would need to see the same numbers for white people as well : ,"
13810,"yes , it would be interesting to see the full stats on that ."
13811,"did you know that astronauts can vote from space ? : ,"
13812,yes ! i wonder if they do so by absentee ballot or by some other means .
13813,"they put it in an envelope and drop it on earth ; , lol"
13814,that sounds like fun . it's been good talking . have a great day !
13815,"did you know that citizens of austin , texas voted to rename their garbage dump after fred durst ? that's funny to me !"
13816,that is quite an interesting fact you have there . is there a reason why they are naming it after fred durst ?
13817,"i dunno , i guess the population isn't much of limp bizkit fans ."
13818,did you know that hillary clinton hates limp bizkit as well ?
13819,she probably beat them when she won the grammy for her audiobook ' it takes a village . '
13820,"the book is quite interesting , given that she rejected bill's marriage proposals for two years before finally agreeing to marry him ."
13821,i'm surprised he didn't give up . he had high aspirations dating the president of young republicans when she was in college .
13822,yah . she use to be a republican . quite the turn of events there to be the democratic party's nominee for the 2016 election .
13823,yeah it is . she was a role model for many women . father's were able to show their daughters that they could be anything they wanted to be .
13824,"i totally agreethat if the father's first child is a daughter , it can sway the father's vote towards female . we're in the day and age of role models ."
13825,i agree we are . everyone needs someone to look up to .
13826,"it's not just limited to politics , it applies to other fields such as science , technology , engineering and mathematics . fields which are currently dominated by males ."
13827,it's good to see diversity in different fields . i definitely see it as a good thing .
13828,"yes it is . however , you have the other side of the coin with all these metoo movements . . ."
13829,"yeah that has taken a toll , especially on hollywood . some of it is justified though ."
13830,what do you mean justified ?
13831,men deserve to be called out for their injustices against women .
13832,at the moment or instant it happens or can it be up to the lifespan of the person ? what's the limitation ?
13833,"i feel that some women are embarrassed by the situation . it takes a lot of courage to come out , but i think allegations should be made sooner rather than later . that adds more to the justification ."
13834,"fear sounds like an excuse , but do understand that point . if you don't have any support , it's going to be difficult to come out , same with being part of lgbtq ."
13835,support is key . it was nice chatting with you !
13836,"hi there , do you think elections are important ?"
13837,i think elections are very important . they have represented democracy since the 17th century .
13838,officials in athens thought that elections would lead to oligarchies so they used lotteries instead .
13839,that is very interesting . the study of results and other statistics related to elections is called psephology .
13840,"interesting ! so since 1900 , the taller candidate has won the us presidential election . i hope that's just a coincidence !"
13841,yes that is an interesting stat . trump was taller than hillary i believe . 75 percent is a big majority .
13842,do you think having a none of these candidates voting option is useful ?
13843,i think it would be nice to have . i'm kind of surprised nevada is the only state to have it .
13844,"yeah me too . so astronauts vote from space , but for those of us on earth it seems the voter turnout is low . the turnout for presidential elections hasn't reached 62 . 8 percent in the last 100 years ."
13845,i wish it was higher . during the 2012 us elections international electoral observers were blocked from the polls and nine states . is that even legal ?
13846,"hmm , how weird . in india they made the effort to include people who couldn't easily vote . there was a polling booth in a forest full of lions for one single voter ."
13847,that sounds dangerous but very good for democracy . surprisingly not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918 .
13848,in alabama 34 percent of the black male population has lost their vote
13849,that is terrible . even citizens in austin texas voted to rename the garbage dump fred durst .
13850,yeah we use voting for some interesting things !
13851,definitely . it was a big surprise clinton didn't get elected . she was president of the young republicans in college even though she identifies as a democrat now .
13852,"wow , interesting ! another interesting thing about hillary is she adopts a southern draw when campaigning in southern states ."
13853,very smart of her . stephen hawking once lectured at the white house on science with both hillary and her husband .
13854,i wonder what the lecture was about . i'll have to look that up .
13855,yeah it would be fascinating to hear you're such a smart guy . clinton is actually grammy winner too . very talented . thanks again for talking to me today hope you have a good one .
13856,great chatting with you . have a good one !
13857,"hi , how are you ? what do you know of our friend the sun ?"
13858,"hi , i know the sun makes up 99 . 86 percent of the mass of our entire solar system . but , i'd sure like to see him sometime today , it's been raining here at my house , all morning !"
13859,"he can be a shy one at times . give him some time . he'll come back , as radiant as ever ."
13860,"yeah , i hope to see that nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma . how about you ?"
13861,i do like the sun . he has generally been consistent . he shows up regularly but doesn't really get in the way too much . does his job .
13862,did you know the sun's equator rotates faster than its poles ?
13863,i guess it's not solid so the widest part moves pretty fast . that makes sense .
13864,interesting fact : helium was discovered on the sun before it was found on earth !
13865,huh . i did not know that . i guess it's a tough element to detect . maybe the sun is a fiery ball of mischief with all kinds of secrets .
13866,apparently so ! have you heard about the radio station where you can listen to the sun's music ?
13867,"i guess the sun likes to sing , like many of us . i wonder if the sun can carry a tune . probably not ."
13868,"well , it might sound pretty wild when the solar flares are active !"
13869,"yes , the flares really can rock hard , hard enough for the kids !"
13870,true that ! the sun is by far the most important source of energy for us earthlings or so i've read .
13871,"the sun has been quite generous with his resources . in fact , the sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500 000 years ."
13872,that's awesome ! i couldn't imagine life on earth without its warming rays .
13873,"well , most of us couldn't . we have become dependent , almost addicted . i hope that one day we will give credit to the great one in the sky ."
13874,"amen to that ! on a side note , i've heard that the sunsets on mars are blue ."
13875,"i will never see a sunset on mars . don't have the money for it . anyway , great chat !"
13876,"great chatting , with you as well . enjoy the rest of your day , i'm going to continue to watch it rain and hope the sun will show its face for a little while . lol"
13877,i'm sure that he has fond feelings for you too . have a good day !
13878,"take care , friend !"
13879,did you ever read ' the kiss ' by kathyn harrison ? it is about an affair she had with her longestranged father while in her 20's
13880,omg no ! harrison is very controversial !
13881,"yes , it is very shocking . she had written about her childhood with her grandparents , but later this ."
13882,"from this it sounds like the person likes the book . a touching and at times jawdropping portrait of the maternal grandparents who raised her , is that she's only getting to this rich material now ."
13883,her grandmother apparently is a fabulous character .
13884,"wow , i guess so . her first novel was called thicker then water ."
13885,her grandfather apparently was raised by a widowed mother and she had to take in boarders . her grandfather was a surveyor and engineer in alaska and then fought in wwi ending up a traveling salesman in california . her grandmother
13886,"i was just reading that ! our financial collapse is schizophrenic . we are desperately poor , and i lack for nothing , ' how is that possible ?"
13887,"they had all kinds of items and lessons along with fancy things , but still saved up for a toaster with blue chip trading stamps . i guess they balanced things out still making her appreciate what she got and work for it ."
13888,"i guess so . the vocabulary was british sweaters were jumpers , washcloths were flannels ."
13889,interesting ! she had to go to bed at seven ! i wonder if she had any siblings ?
13890,that is a good question ! did you know this ? the sun is the star at the center of the solar system .
13891,"that's cool ! it can produce every energy in one second to meet the needs of the planet for 500 , 000 years ! ouch !"
13892,we need to harness that ! i'll have to look this up ! there is a radio station that translates solar activity into sound and you can listen live to the sun's music
13893,i wonder if the music is as good as elvis ! did you know that the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy ! i wonder how much power that star has !
13894,and the sun makes up 99 . 86 percent of the mass of our solar system !
13895,looks like it rules ! do you like to read ? george w . bush seems to as he read 14 biographies of lincoln during his presidency and 186 historical nonfiction books . i wonder how he found time .
13896,"wow , i'm actually impressed ! this is bad though . . the world's longest piece of fiction is a 4 million word super smash bros brawl fan fiction ."
13897,"the best selling ' nonfiction ' book according to guinness is the bible . so many people have bought it , wonder how many have read it ?"
13898,"mu hasband and i were talking about that last nite . scary , huh ? term ' robotics ' was accidentally coined by science fiction author isaac asimov in 1941 ."
13899,"wow , interesting . books often inspire the future or cartoons . for instance , i remember watching the jetsons with ' face time ' with george's boss ! haha ! do you like fiction ? julius caesar wrote fan fiction of hercules and oedipus in his youth . nice chatting !"
13900,how are you ? do you like stars wars . the franchise began in 1977
13901,"hello , how are you ? i love stars wars , although theres quite a bit of facts i didn't know that i just read recently ! while filming ' star wars : the force awakens ' , actor oscar isaac specifically requested that his character poe dameron be a native of the planet yavin 4 . this is because the scenes on yavin 4 in the original trilogy were filmed in guatemala , where isaac is actually from ."
13902,"wow , i didn't know that star wars was filmed in guatemala"
13903,"me either , that must have been hot ! ! lol marcia lucas , george lucas' then wife , was the reason for major changes to the original star wars film . obi wan's death , leia's good luck kiss and reediting the trench run to increase tension were all her ideas . she won the academy award for editing the film while george did not for directing ."
13904,she did a great job ; without her the franchise would never of made 8 . 5 billion dollars .
13905,"k for i know right ! huge success ! james earl jones spent only 2 . 5 hours recording all of darth vadar's lines for star wars and was paid 7 , 500 . i wouldn't mind earning hours ! thats amazing !"
13906,"i'm sure that 7 , 500 has a lot more zeros now after how popular the franchise has become"
13907,"yeah , plus hes getting rolyalties ."
13908,george lucas made out good being able to keep the licensing rights for himself
13909,"he knows what this was worth ! especially , since the books did so well ."
13910,"not only that but he got to keep the merchandising rights for himself , making him billions"
13911,"wow ! in 2013 , star wars was dubbed in navajo , making it the first major film to be dubbed in a native american language"
13912,"that's incredible , i guess a movie that makes 65 billion would be the perfect candidate for that"
13913,"do you know much about comics ? i learned some cool stuff . in 1998 , marvel offered the cinematic rights of almost all of its characters to sony for a mere 25 million . sony rejected the offer , and only purchased the rights to spiderman for 10 million believing that movie audiences would only care about him ."
13914,sony screwed up on only taking spiderman lol
13915,"i know , they missed out big time ! marvel successfully argued in court that mutants are not people and thus got to pay the lower rate on xmen ' toys ' instead of the higher rate for dolls because they are not human ."
13916,"lol , did you know disney does not own the rights to have marvel characters in their theme parks east of the mississippi ?"
13917,oh wow ! i wonder why that is the border lol
13918,i think east of the mississippi the rights belong to universal studios
13919,but universal doesnt have any marvel characters or rides .
13920,"i think they used to have a spiderman ride . well i gtg , nice talking with you"
13921,hello ! are you a star wars fan ?
13922,no . my son is a fan . i'm interested in discussing and knowing more about it though .
13923,i have not seen most of the movies but i have seen various parts . did you know that the last jedi grossed 620 . 2 million dollars ? !
13924,"i heard about it . i think the force awakens grossed better , adjusting for inflation ."
13925,another fun fact is that james earl jones spent over 2 . 5 hours recording all of darth vader made 7500
13926,that was amazing . is george lucas still making movies . he created the star wars .
13927,i do not believe he is .
13928,"he made over 8 . 5b , before adjusting for inflation , for his star war movies . i wonder why he stops making more movies since he is young enough , i think ."
13929,i can't imagine having all of that money . are you interested in disney movies
13930,"i do . i watch disney movies with my granddaughters . the walt disney company , the owner of disney movies , is very successful ."
13931,my family loves disney too ! did you know that the lion king was the first disney film to be dubbed into zulu for its african release
13932,"i did not know that . thanks . apparently , disney used a special camera to make their older films , like bambi , to look more realistic ."
13933,thats crazy technology for back in the day .
13934,"i know , right . disney is always trying to keep up with technology . that's why it is very successful ."
13935,i think its very interesting that the toy industry gets involved the beginning of the film production .
13936,please tell me more about it . i am only aware that they were involved after movies were produced successfully .
13937,it is before the production actually . i am sure they want to be able to have products launched as the movies are being showed for the first time .
13938,"it makes sense . apparently , it would take over 9 . 4 million party balloons to lift carl's house in disney pixar movie entitled ' up ' . i like pixar movies ."
13939,pixar has great movies . they are known in the big six film studios
13940,"does disney own pixar now ? i heard about disney wanting to buy pixar but i'm not sure . also , is the public allowed to tour disney studios in burbank , california ?"
13941,i know they work together but i am not sure if they own it .
13942,i see . do you know that michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics so that he could play spider man in his own produced movie ?
13943,i would have loved to see that . thriller probably would be featured .
13944,"i love thriller . michael jackson was not successful in his bidding but walt disney ended up acquiring marvel entertainment . anyway , i've got to run . nice chatting with you ."
13945,hello do you like star wars ?
13946,i sure do . do you know who oscar isaac played in it ?
13947,yeah he playes poe dameron and requeste that he be from yavin 4
13948,yeah because that was filmed in guatemala which is where he is from
13949,"yeah that was cool of him to request that , going all the way back to his roots"
13950,yup agree there with you . did you know goeroge's wife won an academy award because she changed things in the script ?
13951,yeah and she deserved t because she put scenes like obi wan's death and such in there
13952,"yeah exactly , or leia's good luck kiss . those made the movie what it is"
13953,true . it was also the first major film to be dubbed in navajo
13954,that is awesome . 20th century originally thought it was going to flop . man they were wrong
13955,yup and he was smart to buy the rights to it for 500 000 and make billions later
13956,"exactly , smart business man and a great movie maker"
13957,yup . do you like marvel ?
13958,i love marvel . did you know they offered the rights to the character to sony and they only bought spiderman ?
13959,"they had a great chance there but thought only spiderman was going to be popular , their loss"
13960,yeah exactly . do you know the character access ?
13961,"yes the guy that keeps dc and marvel separate , pretty cool"
13962,"yeah it is . how about blue ear , the superhero ?"
13963,yes that won was created for a deaf little kid who complained to his mom that there are not superheroes with hearing aids
13964,yeah that was super sweet of them to accommodate a little kid and make him feel powerful
13965,"i know , they do stuff like that from time to time"
13966,hello ! do you like disney ?
13967,"hello , yes i do like disney . i heard recently that the movie , wreck it ralph , had been in development since the late 1980s !"
13968,that is crazy . i am surprised that it has taken that long . it was a really good movie .
13969,"i agree ! maybe that is why it was so good though , because they took so much time with it . they changed the title alone four times ."
13970,it is a unique title . my favorite is lion king though . it was the first disney film to be dubbed into zulu for its african release .
13971,"i love lion king , the movie and the soundtrack ! hey , did you know that back in the 70s disney reused a lot of their animation frames which resulted in identical scenes in some movies ?"
13972,"i would like to see that . another new one that i love is frozen , which was the first animated disney film directed by a woman ."
13973,frozen was very good i have to admit . i thought i might be getting too old for disney but i did like it !
13974,i have never thought about the toy industry in regards to movies .
13975,i do sometimes . there's a lot of different toy related movies . it seems like the toy industry gets involved before the movie is released .
13976,it makes sense that they will have inventory before the movie shows . it would be bad for sales to wait until after the movie is released to start making toys .
13977,i agree . toys are very important . marvel went to court about their xmen toys .
13978,i heard about that . they argued that mutants are not people !
13979,"i don't see how they won in my opinion , they are people lol ! but hey , it's cool ! disney even owns a bit of marvel now speaking of disney ."
13980,and they still can't show their characters at the theme park
13981,it's sad to have to adhere to contracts signed before you buy something . marvel signed a contract with universal and that effects disney .
13982,it would have been cool to see the characters walking around the parks for entrainment and pictures .
13983,true . maybe someday they'll be able to get out of the contract .
13984,i am sure with enough money they will be able too .
13985,disney does have the money . they are regarded as one of the big six film studios in hollywood .
13986,i like that they still give back and try to help kids !
13987,"hi , are you ready to chat ?"
13988,i am . it was illegal for women to wear pants in france until 2013 .
13989,was it ? i think women wore pants . what happened ? did someone get arrested ? what about all the american tourists ? did they pay fines ?
13990,sounds weird to me but i read it . also women were not allowed to wear pants on the senate floor until 1993 .
13991,"that makes sense . why would we want women wearing pants on the senate floor ? sets a dangerous precedent . soon women would be wearing pants everywhere , and that would be chaos !"
13992,"speaking of pants apparently one of the hulk's superpowers is indestructible pants , haha !"
13993,the man had to buy special pants . they don't sell them on amazon . he is a modest monster .
13994,imagine having a job where you have to test bulletproof cloths by getting shot in them .
13995,"that sounds like a great job ! how much does it pay ? when life gives you bullets , get a job testing clothing !"
13996,apparently the greeks made asbestos clothing and it was treated like it was as valuable as gold .
13997,"the greeks ? boy , they must have had lots of cancer and breathing problems . what would you do with clothing like that ? i guess you can impress your friends ."
13998,"well when you compare it to the guy who wore 70 items of clothing in a chinese airport to avoid bagging charges , not sure who wins ."
13999,i would wear a hundred items if need be ! i don't care if people stare ! i don't care if security makes me take them off !
14000,i hear you . apparently the color of baseball empires is of vital importance to the league .
14001,the color of baseball umpires ? their clothing ? i always thought it was pink because that's the most festive color .
14002,apparently black is in . lol ! have you ever seen frozen ?
14003,"isn't that some sort of kids movie ? i haven't seen it , but i bet it was popular ."
14004,kids went crazy ! ! ! it was disney's 53 animated film .
14005,disney is a hit machine ! the kids are addicted ! it's like crack for kids !
14006,yeah a they have a lot of money . they just bought marvel not to long ago .
14007,"marvel is now the mouse . well , i had fun chatting up a storm with ya !"
14008,"you too , have a good one !"
14009,"keep it frozen , dude !"
14010,"you too , apparently olaf got to go to space because of an 8 year old little girl ."
14011,did you know that pilgrims used to wearing clothing that was full of color ?
14012,"no , i thought they wore black all the time . this is another conspiracy from the black dye complex ."
14013,lol are you a fashion aficionado ?
14014,"if i had money , yes , since i have none , i have a nice shirt that goes for job interviews and funerals . the rest is strictly functional ."
14015,me too . i would dress to the 9's if i had the money . there is a store in alabama that sells clothes found in unclaimed baggage at airports . that's more my style . i can get more bang for the buck shopping at goodwill and the salvation army thrift stores .
14016,"you could have great clothe there , people who have enough money to fly have enough money to buy clothes . i never seen a flying hobo ."
14017,that's funny ! lol have you ever heard of the brand rip curl ? i guess they make their clothes in north korea but the labels say made in china . i never heard of the brand .
14018,"they makes short and surf styled clothing . it is mostly for teens and young adults , or old people who want to look young ."
14019,ahhh . . . ok . not for me then . . . i'm 48 and on the downside . lol did you know that apple had a clothing line back in 1986 ?
14020,"no , did you had to update your clothes every few months ?"
14021,"hahaha that's awesome . , in my best old lady voice . . . . , do you like to wear trousers ? lol i do . i don't go anywhere without them ."
14022,"trousers are the best , i don't know why the romans would consider them barbarian ."
14023,"i never knew that . i guess that's why they are always shown wearing togas , etc . lol"
14024,"maybe because barbarian were wearing trousers at that time , not because they were snobbish of pants ."
14025,lol i find it funny that aladdin's pants were modeled after mc hammer . that is spot on hilarious !
14026,"do if aladdin was filmed in the 70s , he would wear disco pants and shirts with large collar ? i would want to see that ."
14027,"hahaha nice . in collinsville , il they have a law that prohibits saggy pants . lol"
14028,"maybe that is for safety reasons , if it is a rural town , saggy pants could be dangerous around machinery . ."
14029,that would make sense then . never thought of that . we have an amish community near me so i could see something bad happening . there's a lot of the amish who have had bad accidents in some of the lumber mills they have where they got caught in the machinery .
14030,"yeah , safety is important , that why you don't see people in robe or toga in refinery . even if they were fireproof ."
14031,ha ! i had a good time chatting with you today !
14032,"you too , and keep looking for discounts on clothes ."
14033,i will ! lol have a good one !
14034,"hi , how are you ?"
14035,"good , thank you . have you've seen frozen ? it has won two academy awards and is the all time best selling blu ray in the us"
14036,"i've never seen the film , but maybe i should . i did read the snow queen by andersen many years ago ."
14037,"cool , i guess jennifer lee is the first female director of a walt disney animation , that's surprising considering it's almost a 100 years old"
14038,women generally don't get into positions of power in hollywood . she made a film that generated over 1 billion .
14039,"it's funny , disney originally named frozen ' snow queen ' but changed it because they thought feminine titles underperform at the box office"
14040,"that's a good point . robert lopez wrote let it go for frozen , and has won an emmy , grammy , oscar , and tony ."
14041,"that's interesting , he also guest wrote a south park episode , surprising he worked on an adult show like that"
14042,"he is a talented composer ! mc hammer's pants also have a disney , it seems ."
14043,"lol , i did think aladdin's pants looked familiar when i saw it at the theater as a kid"
14044,"according to the romans , pants were barbaric . i wonder how the romans rode horses ."
14045,not comfortably i'd imagine if they didn't wear pants because they thought it too barbaric
14046,"i wonder their take on saggy pants would be . probably would have outlawed , like in collinsville ."
14047,"maybe , i wonder what he would think of pilgrim clothing which was apparently full of color"
14048,the pilgrims were america's first hippies ! long hair and interesting clothes . they would never have sued a dry cleaner for 67 million though .
14049,"suing a dry cleaner for 67 million for the loss of pants is ridiculous , i'm not surprised a d . c . judge did that"
14050,the judge seems like a bully . i would expect a judge to be more evenhanded with the law .
14051,"yea , maybe he should try to do something about rip curl making clothes in north korea but putting made in china on the label"
14052,i disagree with that . i don't think we shouldn't be doing any business with north korea .
14053,yea but not as sneaky as selling unclaimed clothes from unclaimed baggage from airports like a store in alabama does
14054,that must be a great way to make money ! i wonder if they have to pay for the stuff before they sell it .
14055,"i don't know , maybe they just go to airports and claim it themselves lol . well i got to go , nice talking with you"
14056,nice chatting !
14057,peace
14058,hi how are you doing there ? do you like to wear trousers ? i quite enjoy them myself .
14059,i do enjoy them . i usually call them pants though since i'm in the us .
14060,"pants means underwear in the uk , i believe . i usually call them pants too . trousers sounds a bit refined ."
14061,it definately does sound posh but i think a lot of british words do .
14062,quite true . posh is a word that sounds quite posh . lol .
14063,lol it does . i love fashion in general . there are few things fancier than high fashion .
14064,i am not abig fashion person . i dont have the cash . it looks intringuing though . quite posh lol
14065,it is crazy how much people can determine from simply looking at your clothes . like if your clothes gap in certain ways it shows you wear off the rack .
14066,i bet they can see that everything i wear is right off the rack lol . i would love to own good clothes .
14067,i wonder if apple's clothing line was any good . i never heard of it so it couldn't have been in business too long in the 80's
14068,i bet it was cheesy . who would wear apple clothing back then . it was antichic . geek chic ?
14069,who knows . probably a lot of turtlenecks and jeans . still better than most of the other clothes of the 80's though .
14070,"yes , the jobs look . lol the 80s had a lot of big big hair . and high waisted jeans . not really a look for the heavy set ."
14071,nope not at all . then there was the oh so lovely mc hammer pants . that was not a good look for anyone .
14072,"he was a dancer , so i understood . i thought he patterned his look off of aladdin , not the other way around ."
14073,hmm i could see them making movie aladdin with pants after him . i wonder if pants like that make it easier to horseback ride .
14074,"i figure that they are loose , so yeah . but dont let the romans catch you wearing though barbaric britches !"
14075,i wonder what they would say if they seen some of the saggy pants of today .
14076,"they would outlaw those too as barbaric . anyway , great chat !"
14077,a town in il actually has a law about them . more towns should have that law .
14078,"yeah , it is a silly look . nobody wants to see your drawers . have a good night !"
14079,you as well .
14080,"hello , how are you ? do you like jazz ?"
14081,"hi , do you enjoy jazz ?"
14082,"yes , i do . i find it relaxing ."
14083,"yes , so do i . did you know that jazz is a music genre that originated in the africanamerican communities of new orleans in the late 19th and 20th centuries ? also , it was developed from roots in blues and ragtime ."
14084,"yes , i did . its interesting that a goatee gives comfort to trumpeters when playing ."
14085,i thought that too . did you know that there is a modal jazz developed in the late 1950s that used a mode or musical scale as the basis of its musical structure and improvisation ? that sounds cool .
14086,"no i didn't , very cool . in the 1940's cool jazz developed that sounded calmer and smoother !"
14087,"yes , did you know that pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts ?"
14088,"that's surprising ! i knew that clint eastwood directed and acted in movies , but i didn't know he was a lifelong jazz enthusiast pianist ."
14089,"me either , i didn't know that he scored several films including million dollar baby ."
14090,"yes , are you interested in birds ? i love the hummingbirds . they steal spiderwebs to make and repair nests !"
14091,"now that is really interesting . i love hummingbirds , too . did you know that most birds have bones so hollow that their entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers ?"
14092,"yes , makes sense . i can see how the extinct dodo bird is a subfamily of the pigeon ."
14093,"yes , and that some birds fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when migrating ."
14094,there are known groups of birds without wings that are extinct called moa and elephant birds !
14095,"wow , didn't know that before . human activity threatens about 1 , 200 bird species with extinction but efforts are now underway to protect them ."
14096,"yes , glad for that ! i love to swim especially in the ocean . do you ? i didn't know the us has won as many gold metals in swimming as the rest of the world combined ."
14097,"yes , i love to boogie board in the ocean . what fun that is . did you know that humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth as a survival response ?"
14098,"no , i didn't know that ! there is a bathing suit that was banned , in the 2008 olympics the swimmers wore it and won 94 percent of the races . i wonder what it was made of ?"
14099,"maybe shark skin , lol ! also , there's a type of competitive swimming where the athlete has their hands and legs bound , and swims like a dolphin ."
14100,"i saw that . that's scary ! haven't seen that , but would like to ! good chat ! !"
14101,"thank you , i enjoyed this one ."
14102,"hi , do you like birds ?"
14103,"good morning , yes , i do like birds , i think they are fabulous creatures ."
14104,awesome . did you know the dodo bird is actually a sub family of the pigeon ?
14105,"no , i didn't know that . but , what's amazing to me is how hollow and light bird's skeletons are . so much so that their feathers weigh more than the entire skeleton ."
14106,"thats really weird ! i definitely wouldn't want my bones to be hollow ! that makes sense though , they have to be light enough to fly ."
14107,so true ! i was shocked to learn that there in australia there are wild birds that can mimic the sound of chainsaws and car alarms . how wild is that ?
14108,thats hilarious ! i wouldn't mind seeing one of those ! do you happen to know what they are called ? some birds migrate without even sleeping the whole trip !
14109,"i'm not sure of their name , but they put a bird that can say , ' polly want a cracker ? ' to shame ! no sleep , at all ? there's no way , i could make that migration . lol"
14110,"i know right , i would fail as a bird ! haha i think its really facinating that birds can make really good nests ! they dont even have hands lol they are even smart enough to know that spiderwebs are great at holding the nests together , so they steal spiderwebs lol"
14111,"so smart and crafty ! on a different note , do you know how to swim ?"
14112,"yes , i can swim , how about yourself ?"
14113,"me too ! i learned at a very young age , my mom took me a few weeks after i was born . apparently , i picked it up pretty quickly ."
14114,"wow thats really awesome ! i learned like around 6 years old i think , thats what my parents told me . do you know how to dolphin swim ?"
14115,"i actually can ! i probably can swim just as fast with my hands and legs bound as i can swimming the regular way . i've never competed competitively doing it , but there are alot of athletes that do ."
14116,"thats pretty amazing , i tried once , its so hard ."
14117,have you heard that all cornell university students have to pass a test to see if they have basic swimming skills before being allowed to graduate ?
14118,thats really strict . i guess its good in the long run though ! more people should know how to swim .
14119,"that's so true , i shake my head every summer , when i hear about a little kid drowning . it's so sad and so easily preventable ."
14120,"yeah , i know a bunch of parents that don't know how to swim and they are scared to get into pools with their kids or they only stay in the shallow end . kinda ridiculous , take some lessons so you can save your kids if they need it ."
14121,"amen , to that ! apparently , there are quite a few very good swimmers in the usa , because we have more olympic gold medals than all other countries combined , though ."
14122,"woohoo ! go usa ! haha it's been really great talking to you , have a good one ."
14123,"hey there do you like birds , also known as aves"
14124,i do . my daughter once had an african gray parrot that had a pretty good vocabulary . they have a strong but light skeleton .
14125,ah well i ate some chicken earlier today and i can say that birds are tasty haha
14126,very good ! there are over 10000 species of birds . no wonder bird watchers can stay occupied .
14127,"ya no kidding , i want to see a hummingbird steal a spiderweb , that sounds rad !"
14128,i have seen video of dodo birds landing . they are in the pigeon family and now are extinct .
14129,"ah interesting , i always wanted to eat a dodo bird , i guess i can try pigeon to get the next best thing haha"
14130,i have eaten doves and quails . they are tasty . some birds can imitate a chain saw . our parrot made the sound of sneakers squeaking from watching basketball .
14131,"ha thats scary , ya birds in austrailia can immidate a car alarm , i could see that being annoying haha"
14132,i never got our parrot to play jazz . that is a style known as america's classical music .
14133,"haha interesting , i want an aquatic bird myself , its rare to see those as pets"
14134,"ducks are pretty available , but you have to clip their wings to keep them in your yard . new orleans is known as the birthplace of jazz ."
14135,"ah interesing ill look into ducks , ya i like jazz and i like that clint eastwood puts it in his movies"
14136,i agree . he plays the piano also !
14137,"yup thats cool , i liked that movie million dollar baby he made and the soundtrack he created for it"
14138,that was real drama ! there is a programming language where the program have jazzlike harmonies . artists are everywhere !
14139,"that is cool , i want to learn to play the trumpet but then i'd have to grow a goatee for comfort apparently"
14140,i saw louie armstrong years age just walking into a restaurant for dinner . he had a trumpeter ; s goatee .
14141,"oh thats cool , have you ever heard of pakistani jazz ?"
14142,no . but the world is getting smaller with the internet . is it played by a band or an orchestra ?
14143,ya its a whole orchestra and is apparently at the top of all the charts right now
14144,did you know birds have hollow bones ?
14145,"oh , that must be why they are so light !"
14146,"yeah , apparently the feathers are heavier ."
14147,interesting ! hummingbirds are really light . they are so smart though . they can steal spiderwebs to make and repair nests .
14148,did you know some birds fly from alaska to north mexico without sleeping ?
14149,"wow , that is determination there ! also some birds are determined to drive you crazy , it seems . in australia there are wild birds that mimic car alarms , cameras , chainsaws . ugh , that would be the worst one ."
14150,i'm finding that one very hard to believe .
14151,amazing that they are believed to have branched off from dinosaurs .
14152,"wow , that is pretty cool . what about dodo birds ?"
14153,"oh , i guess them too , but they are also a sub family of pigeon ."
14154,interesting . who would have guessed .
14155,i don't really like ducks that much . i found some swimming in my pool .
14156,"hilarious . what about jazz , do you like jazz ?"
14157,"yeah , jazz is cool . i like small concerts such as the free jazz concerts that are held at a harlem woman's apartment . sometimes top performers stop by ."
14158,did you know clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast ?
14159,i did not know that actually . pakistan has a jazz orchestra that has been topping the charts . i want to check them out .
14160,"that might be interesting . what about swimming , do you like swimming ?"
14161,"yeah , i like swimming ! did you know the front crawl was taught by native americans to the british ?"
14162,"no , i didn't know that . i know there are banned swimsuits in the olympics . well , nice chatting with you ."
14163,"i didn't know that . i guess it was really good . well , i would love to take a dip . it's getting hot here ! nice talking to you ."

14168,i have . do you have a favorite film of his ?
14169,"personally , i like groundhog day or caddyshack ."
14170,i am such a fan of caddyshack . such a great classic . i also like stripes .
14171,"stripes , i forgot about that one . too bad about harold , he was a good writer and actor ."
14172,yeah . that was a sad day . i loved him in stripes and ghostbusters .
14173,yup . do you watch comedy central ?
14174,i do not anymore . do you ?
14175,"no , they cancel way too many shows !"
14176,how many have they canceled ?
14177,100 ! since 1989 . lol
14178,that's a lot . i wonder what abc and nbc do annually . . .
14179,i'm not sure . perhaps they don't make as many shows .
14180,i did see that a lot of shows are going digital before mainstream . seems like the new testing grounds .
14181,that is true . did you know shakespeare invented the name jessica ?
14182,"he invented a few , didn't he ? olivia and miranda too ?"
14183,"yes , olivia and miranda as well . well , nice chatting with you !"
14184,it has been nice chatting with you too ! did you know shakespeare was alive at the same time as pocahontas ?
14185,"no , i didn't , but it doesn't surprise me . have a good day !"
14186,"hi , do you like comedy ?"
14187,"sure , i prefer it over many genres , e . g . , horror and animation , . are you familiar with holly twyford ?"
14188,i am actually not . who is that ?
14189,"she's a stage actress in dc . sort of an ' all american ' girl . she likes family time , farmers markets , naps and just being normal . refreshing . . ."
14190,yeah that is actually refreshing . do you like comedy ?
14191,you already asked me that . 3rd rock from the sun was a favorite it won a golden globe .
14192,did you know bill murray thinks kung fu hustle is the best modern age comedy ?
14193,"yeah , that's an interesting take . have you ever read ' cat mysteries ' ? it's a popular genre in fiction ."
14194,"yeah that is an interesting one , imagine all the car detectives"
14195,also interesting is the pocahontas and shakespeare were alive at the same time . pretty sure they never met .
14196,pretty sure too or he would have definitely written about her
14197,"that would have been interesting . i think holly twyford is interesting in that she is so normal and in the entertainment business . she likes naps , croissants and doing touristy things ."
14198,yeah i think we all appreciate that and glad she sticks to it . did you know shakespeare coined the term 'good ridance' ?
14199,"yeah , that's cool . he also coined ' laughing stock ' and ' brave new world . ' i wonder if that's where huxley got that . . ."
14200,"yeah he has coined so many words for sure . and he invented the names miranda , jessica , and olivia"
14201,"hmmm . speaking of name , the computer language python was named in part after monty python ."
14202,oh that is pretty cool . did you know comedy central has canceled over 100 shows ?
14203,wow . they are ruthless . that's as weird as roger ebert writing a mystery book .
14204,yeah do you know who is the best selling novelist of all time ?
14205,"maybe agatha christie that sold 4 billion . . . oh , actually its the bible who have many authors ."
14206,yeah quite an author . nice chat
14207,are you a fan of shaespeare ?
14208,"i am a fan yeah , what about you ? do you like him ? his work ?"
14209,i do . i was reading up on him and discovered i don't know a lot about him as i thought he did .
14210,"there's much we dont know , he was born in the year 1564 so a lot of info is missing , he did chage our culture forever"
14211,yes he did . he is regarded as the greatest writer in the english language .
14212,"i have to agree with that , his plays have a mayor influence not only on americans but on everyone , i bet shakepeare didn't see that coming"
14213,bet not ! he was alive at the same time as pocahontas and they died only a year apart . what are the odds ?
14214,"i know right , makes you wonder if they ever met each other ,"
14215,"be curious for sure . did you know he invented the names miranda , jessica , and olivia ?"
14216,i didn't know that but i do know he invented some of the phrases we use today
14217,what are some of those phrases ?
14218,"good riddance , wildgoose chase , brave new world . the list goes on , many popular phrases"
14219,awesome ! switching gears . . . do you like comedies ?
14220,"i do like them yeah , also like mystery fictions"
14221,which mystery fictions do you like ?
14222,"robert ebert , one of his actually , ''mystery and romance of the rice cooker''"
14223,i'm not familiar with those . i see that cat mysteries are a popular genre of fiction that involves cats as main characters solving a crime .
14224,"that doesn't sound like fun to me , agatha christie is another great author"
14225,now i've heard of her ! her books have sold over 4 billion copies !
14226,"yeah she is the best selling novelist of all time , her books are great ,"
14227,"i agree . i've ' read ' her books by watching the movies , haha ! thanks for the chat !"
14228,"hi , do you like comedy"
14229,"no , i don't see much theater , there is not opportunities , like in washington d . c ."
14230,i like watching comedy . i feel very relaxed watching comedy
14231,"there is a lot of mediums for comedies , like films , which is your favorite movie ? kung fu hustle like bill murray ?"
14232,"i concur , and i like bill murray a lot . did you watch 3rd rock by any chance"
14233,"i like monty python , it is very popular , it is the inspiration for python programming language ."
14234,it is interesting . did you watch comedy central . i heard that they cancelled more than 100 shows since its creation in 1989
14235,"i have watched a few shows from them the colbert report was funny and i watch a south park episode from time to time , i hope it won't get canceled ."
14236,"i think the show will not be cancelled soon because of their high rating . also , did you watch other comedy series like friends , seinfield . . ."
14237,"in my youth , i have watched seinfeld every week , friends was just before at 8h00 pm . it was very popular , like shakespsear in his time ."
14238,"i agree . i still watch friends occasionally because i find it very funny . between seinfield and friends , which one do like more"
14239,"it think i like seinfeld better , it has influenced some much thing , like shakespear influenced his time ."
14240,it makes sense . i agree seinfield's themes touch more on our daily aspects
14241,"friends is a light comedy , seinfeld is more like a satire , which is more timeless ."
14242,"completely agree with you on this aspect . btw , are you a fan of mystery fiction"
14243,"yeah , i have read a few books from agatha christie when i was young , but not anymore ."
14244,i somehow do not find any interest in mystery fiction because of its unpractical themes
14245,"i have stopped read them because i felt cheated by the writer , who sometimes hid details only to reveal them at the end . which is contrary to the spirit of mystery fiction ."
14246,that is a good point . i would rather watch either comedy or listen to music .
14247,what do you think of shakespear ? he gave some many expression to the english language like break the ice and good riddance .
14248,"i do not like reading shakespear because i am a bit young for that . btw , nice chatting with you . have a happy holiday"
14249,when you get old maybe you will like to know how much important his work was . happy holidays
14250,"hello there , have you seen the infinity war movie ?"
14251,hey i did ! it was the first movie to be shot in full on imax digital cameras
14252,"i heard that , very cool , i have not seen it yet myself but would like to when i get the chance ."
14253,"ya it's worth seeing , you'll see theres a part where iron man eats shawarma , it's making me hungry right now haha"
14254,"that is too funny , i don't even know what a shawarma is , but i heard the movie cause a sizable increase in sales !"
14255,"it did , it's like a sandwich its delicious , did you know that the actor who plays jarvis has never seen any of the movies he's been in"
14256,"no i didn't know that either , that seems so strange to not see the final product you worked so hard on ."
14257,"ya i agree , did you ever watch the incredible hulk series from the 70's ?"
14258,yeah i used to watch old reruns of that show when i was younger . how about you ?
14259,"ya i've seen old episodes from time to time , i guess lou ferrigno plays a part in the avengers : age of ultron which is cool"
14260,"that is cool , he paid he's dues and deserved it too ."
14261,"ya i'm glad he can relax , would you say you're more of a marvel or dc person ?"
14262,"i am more of a marvel person , what is your favorite super hero movie of any side though ?"
14263,"oh i like iron man and wolverine myself , but my favorite superhero of all time would be batman who is dc , yours ?"
14264,my favorite movie from the super heroes would probably be the fist batman with michael keaton .
14265,haha i do like him as batman ! kind of nice is marvel comics created a superhero specifically for a 4 year old boy
14266,yeah i think that is super cool actually . i guess there are something like 300 of them total .
14267,"oh wow that is impressive , i remember when disney acquired marvel in 2009 , i thought that was a crazy thing , and they have exploded"
14268,"yeah that definitely has paid off , should be a good investment for years to come ."
14269,"oh definitely , did you hear how there is only one character owned by both marvel and dc ?"
14270,"yeah and sounds like the name fits the character as well . it was nice talking with you today , i hope you have a good one ."
14271,"hey there , do you like superhero movies ?"
14272,not really much of a fan of those types of movies . what about you ?
14273,"i like them actually , kind of fun to watch . i recently watched avengers : infinity war ."
14274,"haven't seen it . i guess it's good for marvel fans , but i wonder how many of these films disney will release in the next few years ."
14275,it will be interesting to see that for sure . it is the first film that was shot with digital imax cameras only .
14276,"i think there must be more money in the cinema experience . i figure that at home , there is no imax , so to draw people to the theater , they need imax ."
14277,yeah true . do you know who voices the hulk ?
14278,don't know . the hulk is the big green fellow ?
14279,yes that is him . it was played by lou ferigno once and now he stills does the voice for the character .
14280,"that's great ! good for lou ! the man is deaf in one ear . are you keen on learning about the universe that we live in , not the marvel universe ?"
14281,"yes , very much do . did you know there are stars in the universe that we can touch , they are cold enough ."
14282,i guess that would be an interesting experience . i wonder whether we could live on those stars .
14283,interesting way of thinking . some believe the universe is a giant superhologram .
14284,i wonder what i should do with that information . should i just treat everyone like a mirage ? interesting idea .
14285,that is interesting indeed . other think that universes evolve like species do through evolution .
14286,"so the stronger universes survive , and get to propagate their laws , while the weaker ones die ? i wonder which kind of universe we are in ."
14287,yeah that is an interesting theory . another one is that the there is only one electron in the universe .
14288,only one ? how would we all share that electron ? seems like an impossibility .
14289,i know right ? another says that a region is still pulling galaxies into others
14290,"i figure i'm pretty good for the time being . hey , it's been great chatting !"
14291,"same here , have a good one"
14292,do you like marvel comics ?
14293,i love it . do you know who owns the rights to spiderman ?
14294,"yes it is sony , they bought them back in 1998"
14295,yeah and they could have bought the rest of them as well but did not
14296,"yeah for only 25 , that was not a smart decision then"
14297,yeah . have you heard of the character access ?
14298,yes that is the one that keeps the marvel and dc universes separate
14299,yeah . did you know marvel had to argue in court that mutants are not people ?
14300,yes that was so they can keep the price of the xmen toys down
14301,yeah . did you know disney does not have the rights to characters east of mississippi
14302,yes that was due to a contract with universal studios in the 90s
14303,yeah . did you hear of the blueear superhero
14304,yes they made it for that guy with a hearing aid . do you like the avengers movies ?
14305,yes i do . the infinity war one was made with imax digital cameras
14306,yeah . do you know who is the waitress that captain america saves ?
14307,yes that is the one that voices gretchen in recess
14308,yeah . did you know lou ferrigno voices the hulk ?
14309,"yes and has done so for decades , even when he appeared in avengers"
14310,yeah pretty cool . it was really nice chatting with you
14311,"same here , and keep an eye on new superhero movies that might come out"
14312,"haha yeah , have a great one"
14313,are you a fan of the avengers movies ?
14314,i have only seen one or two so far . i have not seen infinity war yet . are you a fan of the movies ?
14315,"i have not seen any of the movies i have to admit , but know they do very well at the box office ."
14316,i have heard that too . i am surprised to learn that some of them die in the infinity war movie though . i wonder how the studio will keep going with movies after this .
14317,"yeah i agree , i think they will come up with new characters to keep it going in my opinion ."
14318,"probably so . have you heard of that character , access ? it's sole purpose seems to be to keep marvel and dc separate ."
14319,i have not heard of him no . are you a fan of marvel comics in general ?
14320,i guess so . i do like some of the movies . i actually haven't read very many comics . disney bought marvel in 2009 so that's probalby what is increasing it's popularity .
14321,"yeah i think that was a huge move , very smart too ."
14322,"i agree . even though marvel has been around since 1939 , disney has a much larger audience and fan base ."
14323,"yes the do , and it's always growing , and buying star wars brings all those people in too ."
14324,it definitely does . did you know though that disney does not own the rights to show some marvel characters east of the mississippi in their theme parks ?
14325,"no i didn't know that , very interesting ."
14326,"yeah , it's all due to a contract marvel signed with universal studies back in the 1990's ."
14327,did you know marvel made a superhero named blue ear ?
14328,"no , what's that about ?"
14329,"i guess it was for a four year old who was uncomfortable wearing hearing aids and he said superheroes dont wear them , so they made one who did !"
14330,that is very nice and very impressive ! it shows that marvel is a good fit with disney because they obviously care about kids !
14331,"yes , i thought that was a very cool thing they did ."
14332,i like to think about how sony must feel by not buying marvel when they had the chance .
14333,"oh gosh , yeah they would have done so well if they did ."
14334,hi good evening . you like marvel comics ?
14335,yup . super big fan . did you see avengers infinity war ?
14336,yes i did . great film . it was the 19th film in the marvel cinematic universe !
14337,what did you think of the ending ? guess everyone was waiting for that big thanos moment .
14338,ending was crazy . thanos was such a good villain josh brolin did a fantastic job !
14339,right ? ! ? i mean the entire cast is great . did any of the deaths shock you ? the one that hit me the hardest was spiderman . but didn't feel too bad . i mean he's got a sequel coming so it can't be all that bad for those who ' died . '
14340,"yeah that was crazy , although i don't remember him dying ? did he save iron man right ? sony is the only company with rights to spiderman ."
14341,"spidey died or ' vanished . ' his was the one where he was stumbling and said , ' i don't feel so good mr . stark . ' glad sony and marvel worked out some kind of deal . was really happy with tom holland . you have any favorite actors in the marvel universe ?"
14342,oh yeah now i remember . . . tom holland was great better than toby imo . i love chris hemsworth as thor . he is such a good god ! also ragnarok was so epic .
14343,"funny , my little girl loves ragnorak . had to double check if she was starting to like boys because she kept saying thor is cool ! i'm really impressed by the way marvel has so many different kinds of characters ."
14344,"haha everyone likes thor i think . yes they do . i like how lou ferrigno , the original hulk , has made some appearances as well ."
14345,"isn't that great . i had read the lou ferrigno had a hearing problem . interestingly , marvel created a superhero named blue ear specifically for a 4 year old boy who told his mom superheroes don't wear hearing aids ."
14346,wow that is so heartfelt of them . marvel is very smart . they even argued in court once that mutants are not people ! it was in regards to their toy licensing .
14347,"man when marvel was acquired by disney back in 2009 i thought that would be a big business mistake . but as you say , they know what they're doing ."
14348,yes exactly . but disney doesn't own the rights to the big marvel characters in theme parks east of the mississippi !
14349,ha . the way disney owns everything it's almost as if they're their own universe ! or maybe they're the sun and everything revolves around them
14350,great comparison ! there is even one character owned by both marvel and dc named access ! his purpose is to keep the two universes separate !
14351,wow . that's pretty cool . think marvel
14352,i am just glad sony didn't end up buying the rights to all of marvel back in 1998 ! well have a good one it was nice chatting with you !
14353,thanks . sorry meant to say in the last post that i think marvel's beating dc overall right not . think stan lee did a great job pushing marvel forward . though a lot of credit does go to steve ditko and jack kirby .
14354,"no problem , and yes i totally agree . marveldc . also rip stan lee ! have a good one !"
14355,have you watched infinity war ?
14356,"i did , i though it was a great movie , it integrated characters perfectly , did you watch it ? did you like it ?"
14357,i did not like it . i don't like marvel movies that much . i have been watching the punisher . i like the marvel series a lot better .
14358,"the punisher is a great serie , did you also watched daredevil , iron fist , luke cage ? those are also pretty good"
14359,"sorry , i meant i have not watched infinity war . yes , i have watched luke cage . i also liked jessica jones . was that marvel too ? and i have not watched the rest but i will have to check them out . it's cool that so many characters were in inifinity wars though ."
14360,"many superheroes indeed , my favorite iron man . infinity war definetely made history , its the first moie to be shot with only digital imax cameras ,"
14361,movies don't hold my attention as much as series . i'm not sure i could sit through infinity wars since it's over two and a half hours long .
14362,"it is pretty long but i think its a must watch movie , the cast is great many of my favorite actors are in the movie and iron man just cracks me up"
14363,at least it seems like the characters are relatable . i heard that the best moments are the ones that were focused on the characters .
14364,"i think its interesting how characters can be bad in one movie but then become good in the next like bucky barnes in the winter soldier , did you watch that movie ?"
14365,"no , i haven't watched that movie . i know what you mean though ."
14366,there is weird fact about the avengers but somehow the movie caused shawarma sales to increase .
14367,"hmm , was that in the movie ?"
14368,"i think in the end of the first movie of the avengers the whole team goes to a small shawarma joint to eat , maybe thats why the sales increased ! one thing i know for sure and that is that im starting to get hungry lol"
14369,"haha , yeah , that is making me hungry too . speaking of foot , oddly , i remember watching the hulk series when i was younger , during dinner . the actor who played the hulk has been voicing the character ever since then including every apperance up to avengers age of ultron ."
14370,"thats an interesting fact indeed , so theres this popular character called jarvis , so the character that plays his voice has never watched the films either so you are not alone lol"
14371,"wow , that is crazy . maybe it just kind of ruins it if you're an actor in the franchise ."
14372,"i guess that could be a bummer , i wonder where the franchise gets all their ideas from ? i bet they had the universe as a source of their inspiration for sure"
14373,are there any holograms in the marvel series ? there is a theory that the universe may be one giant superhologram .
14374,"yes , there are holograms in the movies and that is one crazy theory not sure if thats the right one but im willing to remain open minded lol"
14375,"kind of a scary thought , but kind of cool ."
14376,"hello , are you a fan of superhero movies ?"
14377,"yes , i've seen a few . i really like ironman , and it is funny to read that he use to hide food on the sceen"
14378,"that's interesting , i'm sure they must have had fun with that . speaking of food , i know the avengers caused an increase in shawarma sales ."
14379,really ? i wonder what that is ?
14380,not sure . have you seen avengers : infinity war ?
14381,no . did you ? i'm sure it's good . all of them are . so many stars in one film .
14382,"i have seen it , i thought the technological lengths were impressive . it was the first film shot entirely with digital imax cameras ."
14383,wow . that would be fun to watch in imax theater . i was interested to find that disney does not own the rights to some marvel characters like spiderman .
14384,"that's interesting , i have also heard sony was offered exclusive rights to all their characters , but only purchased the rights to spiderman because they didn't think people would care about other characters ."
14385,really . that seems to have been a big mistake for sony . the plots to these movies a all the same basically . . . fight for good against evil .
14386,"i agree , and yet they last forever seemingly . the same actor who originally voiced the hulk in the 1970's has voiced the character for decades since ."
14387,"really ? each of the heroes have their own personalities . i like the hulk , too . the winter soldier must have been a good guy at one time , is that right ?"
14388,"i'm not sure ! the most interesting character i know is access , it's owned by both marvel and dc , and it's only purpose is to keep the two companies separate ."
14389,"do you know that in reality , the universe is amazing and there may even be another universe in a black hole ?"
14390,"that's interesting , people have their theories about everything in the universe . i've heard on that there is only one electron in the whole universe !"
14391,amazing ! there are lots of sounds out there in the universe . it's thought that in a black hole the sound that is 57 octaves below middle c is emitted .
14392,"i wonder how they measure something like that . it would be interesting to measure outside the observable universe , where a region of space might be pulling galaxies outside ."
14393,only god knows . i've heard there are sounds that come from other parts of the galaxies . recorded ! !
14394,"that's scary to think honestly . i've heard the universe may only be one giant superhologram , maybe that would mean even these sounds are fictional too ."
14395,wow ! ! ! am i a part of a superhologram ?
14396,"who knows ? scientists theorize universes evolve through natural selection , maybe one day we'll figure out something definite . anyways it was nice talking to you , have a good night !"
14397,hi ! are you a superhero fan ?
14398,hi ! i am a huge fan of infinity war ! did you know it was the first film to be shot 100 percent on imax cameras ? that is so cool !
14399,i had heard that . i also heard that they killed off a few big characters .
14400,"it's crazy , isn't it ? i also think it's crazy that there was an increase in shawarma sales thanks to the avengers !"
14401,i know ! that is pretty crazy that it had that kind of influence .
14402,agreed ! but then you have people like the guy who voiced jarvis in the avengers and iron man films who's never watched any of the movies . can you believe that ?
14403,"that is odd , i am sure lou ferrigno has seen many of the hulk films since he started voicing the character ."
14404,"i'm sure he has . ha ! i'm also sure the waitress in avengers that captain america saves , who also voiced the character gretchen in recess , has seen the films as well !"
14405,i think most actors or actresses do . i guess some just want to be done with them .
14406,"i don't blame them one bit . acting has to be stressful . i also wonder how stressful a scientist's job is ? speaking of scientists , did you know there are some who theorize universes actually evolve through natural selection like different species do here on earth ?"
14407,"yeah ! i think contemplating the universe is great , especially if we are alone in it !"
14408,"indeed it is ! speaking of the universe , you know it could simply be one massive superhologram !"
14409,wouldnt that be interesting ! i think there is stuff beyond what we even know .
14410,"i do as well . you know , there's also a theory stating there's only one electron in the entire universe ! that is pretty interesting if you ask me !"
14411,"it is , as well as stars so cold we could touch them !"
14412,"that would be awesome to do ! they also say there's a part of space that could possibly be pulling galaxies outside the observable universe . that is crazy , isn't it ?"
14413,it is ! i think the universe is always expanding and that might be why .
14414,"it could be . plus even though the spatial size of the universe is unknown , it's still possible to measure the observable universe !"
14415,"which , in itself , is crazy to me . this seemingly infinite space can be measured we don't even know if there is other life , but we know where it might be ."
14416,"it is , crazy . there are so many questions and contradictions , it's hard to keep up ! well we talked about the marvel ' universe ' earlier , but did you know there's a character both dc and marvel owns called access who was created to keep both dc and marvel's universe's separate ?"
14417,"i would need his help telling them apart . lol . it's been nice chatting , but i must get going ."
14418,"that suprised me they both own a character and yet , disney doesn't own the rights to the big named marvel characters in all the theme parks east of the mississippi because , in the 1990s , marvel signed a contract with universal studios . well it was nice chatting with you as well ! hope you have a great day , friend !"
14419,you as well !
14420,do you play video games ?
14421,"you know , i'm older . i actually played pong when it came out and pacman , but i haven't in 30 years . do you play , much experience in them ? shocking to me that jane mcgonigal calculated we play 3 billion hours of video games a week as a planet ."
14422,"interesting . i've played pong , my first game system was an atari ."
14423,"i read somewhere that atari had 52 or 64 colors , pong had two on my the old tv my dad had in the basement . low tech indeed , have you played fortnite ? seems like a big deal in gamer circles ."
14424,"i think it was nintendo . i've never played fortnite , i don't even know what it is to be honest ."
14425,"well that makes two of us , those players probably don't know what pong is or was . i have heard of minecraft , once again never played . a world bigger than neptune it's reported , are you familiar with that at all ?"
14426,"interesting , how is that possible ?"
14427,"i have no idea , i assume you use amazon though . you see where jeff bezos built a clock into a mountain to run 10 , 000 years . we'll not see that one run out of winding or battery , nor our grandkids ."
14428,i use amazon too . do you know if it is an atomic clock ?
14429,"i assume it is , i don't think we have battery technology for 10 . 000 years , if we did you'd never have to charge an electric car and it would run your whole life . jeff bezos had some problems with the national inquirer recently , he might have wanted to hide in his warehouse . you see the workers walks 715 miles a day , they wouldn't need a gym membership ."
14430,"yeah , i don't think so either . i didn't know that amazon owned imdb ."
14431,"yes , kind of makes sense if they're selling movies and video's . you see that first amazon customer spent 27 . 95 in 1994 and got a building named after him . i didn't know that , had you heard that or know his or her name ?"
14432,"i'm not sure , i've never heard of this . i know amazon gets a special deal with the usps ."
14433,"yes , i assume bulk savings as they might be the usps biggest customer . it makes sense to me , you see where the first video games were called , ' cathode ray tube amusement devices ' and used by the military . i assume flight simulator or night goggle vision fighting , something like . you think they had any idea it would be the start of a 74 billion dollar industry worldwide ?"
14434,i'm not sure . i wonder if we could get a similar usps deal ?
14435,"i really doubt it unless you ship a lot more things than i do . you see where it's illeagle for kids under 16 to play video games in south korea after midnight , that a good idea , especially on school nights but how would the government enforce that , seems like parents should know that already and want their young kids asleep at midnight , ?"
14436,apparently as a planet we play 3 billion hours of video games a week .
14437,"yes , and since i play none there's a few out there playing a lot to run the total up . you see where amazon is the third most valuable company in the us by market capitilization . i mean they make some electronic devices , they really just ship goods from manufacturers to consumers . i don't think its good that they're so valuable as simply a shipping firm ."
14438,"i didn't know that jim hanks does woody's voice in video games , did you ?"
14439,"neither did i , you think the hanks family sits around the table at thanksgiving using their various movie voices ? that is pretty amazing family , but tom seems like a pretty normal guy ."
14440,they seem like they would be cool people to get to know .
14441,are you a fan of video games ?
14442,"hi , yes i love video games , from classic games to newer games like hitchhikers guide to the galaxy which is surprisingly good ."
14443,i never knew that was an actual game ! video games were called cathode ray tube amusement devices when first invented
14444,huh i didn't know that . yeah it's a great game and stephen fry does narration in the video game too . you should check it out .
14445,i will check it out . i watched the movie but now i need to play the game
14446,fry also does narration in the harry potter games . most of which are actually very good usually movie or book video games aren't good but they are great .
14447,"i am sure i can buy it on amazon , i love amazon , do you ?"
14448,"can't go wrong with same day shipping , or sunday deliveries . i've been buying on amazon since they were a bookstore ."
14449,"i love same day shipping , it started off as a book sale company ."
14450,yeah i said i've been buying since they were a book store . its amazing they can ship all this heavy stuff for free . the first customer who bought from them got a building named after them !
14451,"you can get everything on sunday , they have a contract with the usps to ship on sunday"
14452,yeah . they are so big and only getting bigger . i like that they've branched out to other things like owning a publishing company .
14453,"for sure , they are so rich and jeff bezos is too ! i hear that people that work at amazon walk between 7 and 15 miles per day as part of their shift"
14454,they get a lot of bad press for that but i find that hard to believe . i'm sure most people drive machines across the building . i've worked in big warehouses before .
14455,"me too , they don't walk that much , otherwise they would be so skinny ! did you know imdb is owned by amazon"
14456,i did not . i wonder what they want with imdb . i don't think that website makes a lot of money .
14457,"for sure lol i was thinking the same thing . i wish i was the first person to buy something from amazon , they have a building named after them"
14458,i told you that a minute ago ! they spent 27 . 95
14459,"sorry must have missed that , good chatting with you !"
14460,"you too , go buy the game on amazon ."
14461,"i will , thanks ! bye !"
14462,"have you heard of the popular game called fortnite ? the name of the game is survival where players fight each other though zombies and find materials to build shelters , do you play ?"
14463,my kid plays it constantly with all his friends . i guess that is partly why it takes up 12 . 8 percent of traffic to the gaming platform . it went to the top of the charts quickly in the us and a bunch of other countries .
14464,"yes , it was an international obsession with over 150 million players worldwide ! it's also the mostwatched game on twitch , did you know that amazon owns that site , twitch . it's where people upload streaming of games ."
14465,even basketball champions are referencing the game with their victories . i can't figure out why though as i personally can't stand the game .
14466,"i never got into it , but a lot of my coworkers who are also sports fans talk about it . overall , i think gaming has become more mainstream , seems like there's at least some sort of gaming console in a lot of households these days ."
14467,"pop star drake even plays the game and got 628 , 000 viewers on twitch to view him and ' ninja . '"
14468,i hope he didn't keep kids up past midnight because it is illegal for kids 16 and under in south korea to play video games past midnight . i wonder how they monitor or enforce that though .
14469,"sounds scary though to be caught . but if jane mcgonigal can calculate that as a planet we play three billion hours of video games per week , maybe they can monitor kids in south korea ."
14470,"yeah , wonder what the punishment is , but seems like kids who play video games can stimulate their creative brains like minecraft who partnered with unhabitat to let kids design changes they want to see in the games ."
14471,the military even used video games called ' cathode ray tube amusement devices . ' probably those games were more for a combat mission function . i wonder if the designers of those games would have liked fortnite .
14472,or be inspired from the game ! it's pretty cool fact that tom hanks' brother actually does woody's voice in the video games version of the game . they do have very distinguishable vocal cords .
14473,"wow , that is interesting ! do you play minecraft ? one school in sweden requires minecraft lessons . i think my children will want to move there soon ."
14474,"haha , kids might actually look forward to school ! no , i do not play minecraft but that world is bigger than neptune which i forget is the which largest planet in the solar system in terms of rank ."
14475,i think it is great that kids can have a chance to make their world more environmentally friendly with un habitat partnering with minecraft to let kids make designs of ways to change the environment for the better .
14476,"yes , i agree . considering that minecraft is the third best selling video game of all time , i think their very noble for giving back to the community ."
14477,i would ask amazon to deliver minecraft to my children sometime when they ask me urgently for it on a boring weekend . they have a contract with the post office .
14478,"being that they're the largest internet retailer in the world , they sure would be able to do that . i admire jeff bezos for what an amazing business he has built , i must admit i use a lot of services amazon offers ."
14479,those who work for amazon do a great job and work really hard . they must really be in shape walking 715 miles a day on their shifts .
14480,"yeah , that's a physically demanding job , amazon offers so many products , i didn't know that they also owned imdb , no wonder its integrated in their prime videos . would love netflix to offer that as well ."
14481,"i remember when amazon was just selling books and now it has grown so much . they have audiobooks , video downloads , video games , electronics , even food ! i love to shop on amazon . com"
14482,"me too ! they even offer lowend products under its inhouse brand amazonbasics , but i have tried some of their products and think their quite qualitative for the price point ."
14483,nice talking to you . i think i'll go shop on amazon now for some new furniture !
14484,some theorists think of video games as an artform . i would mostly disagree with that !
14485,"yes , they are definitely an expression of art ! did you know that tom hanks brother jim does voices in video games ?"
14486,i didn't know that . in south korea it is illegal for kids under 16 to play video games after midnight . wish that were true here too
14487,"yes i agree with that , kids are staying up all night on their devices now days !"
14488,i think it is funny that the military called video games cathode ray tube amusement devices . crtad acronym i'm sure .
14489,"yep , there is also a school in sweden with actual minecraft lessons being taught !"
14490,oh no . video games in school not a good idea . lol minecraft is the 3rd best selling video game of all time though .
14491,i'm not surprised about that ! and . . . someone actually built a working 16 bit computer using only minecraft building blocks ! wow .
14492,crazy . how is the minecraft world bigger than neptune ? i don't get that . . .
14493,"i don't understand that one actually , i was just wondering about that ! i see that amazon named a building after their very first customer who spent 27 . 95"
14494,must be theoretical or something . it's hard to imagine that amazon is still smaller than alibaba .
14495,"i didn't know that it was smaller , interesting . i also didn't know that amazon and the post office have a deal to deliver amazon packages to their customers on sunday ."
14496,i get amazon prime deliveries all the time on sunday . aws is their fastest growing subsidiary providing web or cloud based services .
14497,"i have prime also , i've just never received a box on a sunday . i wonder why jeff bezos built a clock into a mountain that would run for 10 , 000 years ? seems like a waste of money when people go hungry each day here in america ."
14498,"strange . i guess hungry people will need to know the time too , but seems excessive for sure . i did not know imdb was owned by amazon . seems they have a hidden base of information there ."
14499,"i didn't know that either . amazon employees must be in pretty good health , they walk on average at work , between 7 and 15 miles ."
14500,i just was reading that too . must be a job requirement to be in good health too . don't want people hurting themselves on the job .
14501,"true . . . . lol . have you ever bought any of the ' house ' products , amazonbasics ?"
14502,"no , i didn't know amazon basics was a thing but if they are cheaper and basic i would try . wonder if they offer on prime ?"
14503,"i'm pretty sure they do offer them on prime , i'm going to find out . i haven't tried them yet , but i have seen them on their website ."
14504,"cool , i'll look into it too . i'd rather talk about amazon and not video games myself ."
14505,"me too ! i have a lot to say about shopping , ha ha !"
14506,have you seen black panther ?
14507,no but i would love to ! ! what about you ?
14508,no ! i have seen other marvel movies though . have you ?
14509,"or yes i have ! this one sounds very catching . this black panther is way richer than bruce wayne , i would like to see that"
14510,"you're right , i read that black panther is the richest one ! do you know the story of black panther ?"
14511,no but i am going to read about it . i would like to see the performance of lupita nyong'o
14512,"i'm not familiar with her , is she in any other movies ?"
14513,she has received an oscar already ! and talking about other marvel movies i really liked the fantastic 4
14514,"which one was that , i don't think i've seen it !"
14515,"i suggest you do , it is really a cool movie . and talking about marvel . i have read they created a superhero blue ear for a 4 year old boy who needed a hearing aid but did not want to use one , so marvel created a superhero aid for him"
14516,"i saw that , it is so thoughtful of them ! do you watch any of the shows associated with marvel on tv ?"
14517,no actually i have not . i have heard marvel was acquired by disney . i am excited to see what would be coming as far as even better movies .
14518,"yes , i saw that too . but i guess disney wont be building any marvel related rides anytime soon . . ."
14519,who knows ? and about walt disney movies i love the wreck it ralph one
14520,"i haven't seen many of the new ones ! i do believe they are rereleasing lion king , have you heard about that ? as live action i think . . ."
14521,i have heard and have seen the trailer . i am definitely going to the movies for it . i love also pixar movies
14522,which is your favorite ?
14523,wreck it ralph
14524,ahhh you did mention that . is there one about emotions ? i believe i saw that one !
14525,the emotions one is inside out . about wreck it ralph i read the development started in the 80's
14526,"ahhh yes that one was so cute ! it's been a pleasure chatting . have a great night or day : ,"
14527,i never saw black panther . i love angela bassett
14528,"i do too . i also love ryan coogler , who cowrote the screenplay"
14529,did you know the richest superhero is actually black panther
14530,yes who has an estimated of 500 billion
14531,"i do get it confused with the black panther party ,"
14532,i did too at first . did you know that the symbols ased on an actual script called nsibdi ?
14533,yes it goes back to the 4th century
14534,correct . chadwick boseman almost went to oxford . he must be smart
14535,yes he could not afford it .
14536,do you like marvel comics ? walt disney owns it
14537,"i do . but they do now rights to show ' big ' marvel characters , avengers , xmen , spiderman , etc"
14538,yes thats in theme parks east of the mississippi
14539,that was nice of them to come up with a hearing aid wearing hero
14540,that as nice . it as for a 4 year old boy
14541,i have never heard of the hero names access
14542,me either . they made it to try to keep both companies' universes separate
14543,did you know that frozen was the first animated disney film directed by a woman
14544,no i did not . they recycled a lot of their animation frames a very long time ago
14545,ye that was back in the 70's
14546,and they make the toys before they make the movies
14547,i would like to see the lino king in zulu
14548,have you seen the black panther movie ?
14549,"i have , and i didn't care for it . i do like the fact that one of the tribal elders , made her acting debut at 88 ."
14550,that's cool . i heard that another related film the lion king was the first disney film to be dubbed into zulu .
14551,"yes , isn't that amazing ? chadwick boseman's benefactor was denzel washington . he thanked him at the premiere of black panther . that was sweet of him ."
14552,i didn't know that but i heard that the script came one dating back to the 4th century in an area around current nigeria .
14553,"i have not heard that . i think its cute that marvel created a superhero with a blue ear , just for a little boy who was uncomfortable wearing hearing aids . i wonder how much stan lee played a part in that ."
14554,i can't believe stan lee is dead . i wonder if the movies will be as good without his input .
14555,"i miss him on twitter . i hope so , there are so many stories left to tell . i'm glad michael jackson wasn't able to buy marvel ."
14556,jackson bought all the rights to the beatles music . i wonder who in his family owns them now . that's a lot of money . i can't believe marvel offered sony for 25 million but turned it down . they have lost billions .
14557,"i think some of the catalog was auctioned off to pay debt . or , they went to his kids . i don't get why sony did that . anyway , at least jackson was never able to play spider man in his own movie ."
14558,i didn't know till recently disney acquired marvel . that is a smart company to keep going all these years .
14559,"disney does a lot of weird things . big hero 6 , was created on a super computer ."
14560,"yeah , they don't make cartoons like they used to . it is all computer generated . but i was surprised to learn frozen was their first film directed by a woman ."
14561,it's insane that it took them that long . did you know that dr . strange's character is based on sir isaac newton ?
14562,"i didn't . i guess that is where they got that weird cape from he wears . looking at old painting of him . i didn't know newton could travel through time . oh wait , no he created gravity , oh wait , or was that applesauce from the apple that fell on his head ."
14563,"he's the gravity guy , lol . i guess if you are hit in the head hard enough , you can travel through time . after all , he was once a sorcerer supreme ."
14564,"hmm , that is true . if you get hit in the head . go into a coma and wake up ten years later you have traveled 10 years into the future as far as your reality goes . when you go to sleep at night you travel 8 hours into the future cause you don't realize the time has passed if you don't wake up the whole time ."
14565,"and then when you wake up , you are t'challa , king of wakanda ."
14566,"i never read comic books as a kid . did you know that marvel got to pay a lower rate on xmen toys since they are not human , as opposed to human dolls ?"
14567,"i didn't know that . had the mcu of failed , merrill lynch would have ended up owning captain america and the rest of the avengers ."
14568,"interesting , it's all about money . i can't believe black panther is supposed to have 500 billion , while stark only has 100 billion , wayne a puny 80 ."
14569,"well , shuri is a better inventor than tony . my problem with the movie , is that they rushed it . i think they could have done a much better job , had they of taken their time with it ."
14570,"well , i am sure there will be many more . lots of comics out there . lots of material . at one time they tried to ban comics cause they thought they made kids violent ."
14571,"thank you for chatting with me , it has been nice . enjoy your night ."
14572,i have learned a lot about black panther from you . thanks .
14573,you are welcome .
14574,hey are you a black panther fan ? it seemed to be a cult classic !
14575,i have heard a lot about it ! i know t'challa is crowned king of wakanada following his father's death .
14576,yep you're right . actually black panther is considered the richest superhero too .
14577,i wonder how rich he is ?
14578,he has an estimated 500 billion ! ! ! that is dirty rich !
14579,that is a lot of money . and i thought disney was a big deal !
14580,yeah same with me . marvel is just as big . in 1998 they actually offered the cinematic rights of their characters to sony !
14581,wow . marvel is the company that created superhero blue ear for the boy that had to wear hearing aids but told his mom superheroes do not wear hearing aids . marvel heard it and created the character .
14582,that is so nice of them . marvel actually argued in court once that mutants are not people !
14583,was that the case fought to pay a lower rate on toys instead of a higher rate on dolls ?
14584,yes thats the one ! i think they won !
14585,good for them ! i know marvel branding began in 1961 .
14586,thats a lot of years of making money ! disney actually doesn't own the rights to show popular marvel characters in theme parks east of the mississippi !
14587,"oh , interesting . wait , is that due to a contract ?"
14588,yeah they signed the contract with universal studios back in the 90's !
14589,oh that was a long time ago ! marvel started as timely productions .
14590,interesting . sounds like they then progressed to becoming atlas comics . . .
14591,"yes , they might have . so back to disney , frozen was the first animated film directed by a woman ."
14592,wow talk about starting off with a bang ! ! that was a great movie . another first was when lion king dubbed into zulu for its african release .
14593,i loved lion king ! i know during the 1970's disney recycled a lot of their frames resulting in identical scenes in some movies .
14594,yea i heard about that . the toy industry also sounds like they anticipate the movies ! nice talking to you friend .
14595,do you know many facts about voting ?
14596,hmmm . how about that the 2012 election was the first that didn't have a veteran on either party's ticket ?
14597,good point ! did you know that the indian gov't sets up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for a single voter ? i kind of find that hard to believe because as far as i know there are only tigers in india .
14598,haha . well there once was a dog that beat two people in an election for mayor then served 13 years ! wonder what city that was .
14599,"what are the odds of that ? hahah the citizens of austin , tx once voted to rename their garbage dump after fred durst !"
14600,a cat named hank placed third in a senate election in virginia . what is it with people voting for animals ?
14601,that's funny ! lol astronauts can vote from space . that's a good thing !
14602,always good when people can vote . how about this one the candidate who blinks the fastest has lost every presidential debate since 1980 . that's a crazy stat .
14603,how in the heck did someone even decide to start tracking that data ? wow . lol
14604,i was thinking the same thing . another animal getting votes in 1988 a chimp came in third place for mayor of rio de janeiro .
14605,that's funny ! 34 percent of the black male population in alabama has permanently lost the right to vote !
14606,"that'd tragic . hopefully they can pass legislation to correct that . speaking of alabama , 40 percent of voters voted to continue the legal ban on interracial marriage and this was in 2000 ."
14607,"that's crazy . when arnold schwarzenegger was governor of ca , he would fly by private jet 3 hours every day to sacremento ."
14608,"man , that's quite a commute . jfk , who is widely remembered for his work to advance civil rights , actually voted against the 1957 civil rights act ."
14609,interesting ! texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment .
14610,"that's awesome . in south carolina , an atheist cannot be governor . that's insane ."
14611,"crazy indeed ! in 1934 , north dakotas governor declared martial law and seceded from the us . never heard that before ."
14612,"i've never heard that either . in kentucky , you can't be governor if you've ever participated in a duel . i guess that rules me out . haha ."
14613,what ? that is an odd one for sure ! the beatles wrote ' come together ' for timothy leary's 1969 ca governor campaign . it's been fun chatting with you !
14614,you too !
14615,have a good day !
14616,good afternoon theo . i think it's very important to vote in elections what about you ? elections have been operating since the 17th century .
14617,it is a great process of decisionmaking for citizens to choose who gets to hold a public office . democracy is great !
14618,yes democracy is indeed the best no doubt . officials in ancient athens were appointed by lottery because they believed elections would lead to an oligarchy . boy were they wrong .
14619,yeah electoral reform was definitely needed to improve the fairness of the process for sure .
14620,i definitely agree . another weird thing is that since 1900 the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75 percent of the time . now that i think of it trump was taller than hillary .
14621,"hmmm , that is so weird . not as weird as a cat named hank who placed 3rd in a virginia senate election . lol"
14622,yeah must not have been very good candidates . the voter turn out for us presidential elections hasn't breached 62 . 8 percent in the last 100 years . that's too bad .
14623,"yeah probably not . so like the taller candidate winning 75 percent of the time , the faster blinker in the presidential debates has lost every election since 1980 . i wonder who sits around and counts the blinking ?"
14624,yeah i need to know who is coming up at the stats ! nevada is the only state to have a none of these candidates voting option for presidential elections .
14625,so do i . i like the way oregon works . all their elections are conducted by mail so you don't even have to leave the house to vote .
14626,wow that is so convenient ! almost like astronauts voting from space .
14627,yes just like that . apparently people like animals more than some politicians . a dog beat two mayorial candidates and actually served 13 years as mayor .
14628,"ha ha that is hilarious . in 1934 , north dakota's governor declared martial law and seceeded from the us . i didn't even know that was legal !"
14629,"don't laugh too much at the dog . in rio de janeiro , a chimpanzee got 400 , 000 votes and came in 3rd in another mayoral race . those mayors must be horrible people ."
14630,wow that is so amazing ! how does that even happen ? when arnold schwarzenegger was governor of california he commuted three hours every day by private jet . not exactly environmentally friendly .
14631,wow you are right about that . in kentucky you can only become governor if you have never participated in a duel . who even does that anymore ?
14632,ha ha that is some old school rules right there . do you remember the beatles song come together ? it was written for a california governor campaign !
14633,"really , how cool . the governor of ok has a pool shaped like the state . i think that is awesome ."
14634,yeah that is very patriotic . texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment . it was the second elected female in the nation ! it was nice conversing with you ! i hope you have a good evening .
14635,"girl power ! : , i like how politics is progressing in that way . same here . bye !"
14636,bye !
14637,hey there did you vote in the last election ?
14638,"i did not , i would have probably selected ' none of these candidates ' option if i was in nevada"
14639,"yep i would do that too . i think that's an option everyone should have , would you ever live in ancient athens ? apparently they would do elections like a lottery"
14640,seem like they were trying to avoid oligarchy to form !
14641,yep it's apparently so . it's kind of sad that voter turnout maxes out at 63 percent in the united states . what percent do you think it should be ?
14642,not sure but people just dont trust any politician anymore . did you know astronauts can vote from space ?
14643,"wow that's really cool ! another thing that i didn't know is that the taller presidential candidate has won 75 percent of the time since the year 1900 , so the democrats should definitely run a basketball player lol"
14644,i am wondering if that is a coincidence because it has happened for more than 100 years and 75 percent is a high percentage
14645,yep i agree with you . i wonder which election was won by the shorter candidate actually haha . did you hear that in 2012 international election observers were blocked in nine states from viewing the polls ? why would that be
14646,that sounds pretty strange ! it is strange also that a garbage dump was named after fred durst and that was voted by the citizens of austin tx
14647,"that is pretty funny . i guess if you are fred durst you would be kind of embarrassed , but you have so much money you just don't even care lol"
14648,"that is true , they are just happy to make headlines , did you know how the indian government put a voting booth in a forest full of lions ?"
14649,"no i didn't know that . that's super nice of them though . what is it nice is that 34 percent of the black population in alabama , specifically males , lost their right to vote permanently"
14650,"that is crazy , talking about music , i did not know that the beatles's come together was written for a political campaign !"
14651,"no i didn't know that either . are there any governors that you like ? i remember when schwarzenegger was governor of california , apparently he would commute to work everyday"
14652,"he commuted 3 hours wow , that is such a long commute , and it was in a jet !"
14653,"yep in a jet , seems like a waste of money especially for fuel but oh well , did you hear about the governor who seceded from the united states ?"
14654,i heard something happenned in 1934 in north dakota . i wonder why that ocurred ?
14655,yes i wonder what caused him to do that . very interesting that texas had a female governor before the 19th amendment was ratified . that's impressive
14656,that was something out of the ordinary ! ! and it was the second in the nation !
14657,"yep that's why i think it was so impressive ! also impressive was the guy ralph laurence carr . he actually opposed in turning the japaneseamericans during world war ii , that was probably not a popular opinion back then"
14658,"i try not to involve myself everyday with politics because it can be so negative , but i felt really proud to vote in the recent midterm elections . voting is so important for us as a group ."
14659,"i feel the same , so much negativity , but in order to enact change we must vote ."
14660,it's crazy to think that voter turnout hasn't exceeded 62 . 8 percent in the last century .
14661,"i think many people are disenfranchised with the candidates . nevada has it right , they have a none of these candidates option . . if we could vote for that and then get new people it would be awesome !"
14662,"i'm not sure how i feel about that . sometimes having that option with a group that feels like everything is black and white , or blue and red , so to speak , then not voting for either would take away votes from the other candidates . if voter turnout was better , maybe we could really have a shot of a multiparty election . astronauts even make sure to vote from space !"
14663,certainly there is something we need to do to get better turnouts . but there are so many who cant vote . like the 34 percent of black men in alabama
14664,maybe athens had something right about just having a lottery to elect a candidate ? it does seem like we're heading towards being an oligarchy with the voting system as it is .
14665,true . beatles have written some campaign songs . like fo timothy leary's 1969 governor campaign
14666,"yeah , come together is one of my favorite beatles songs ."
14667,there was a governor that once declared martial law and seceded from the us . back in 1934 .
14668,i believe it was north dakota . i wonder why the united states let them back in ?
14669,"i dont know , maybe it is part of the constitution that states cant do that ? or the people of the state voted to get back in ?"
14670,i know it's in the texas constitution that they can secede . texas is more progressive than people realize . it had the second female governor in the nation before some states even ratified the 19th amendment .
14671,"really , i didnt know that was part of the texas constitution . im from florida , the one state that cant seem to do an election and voting correctly ."
14672,"yeah , and a lot of people think colorado has always been pretty progressive , too . ralph lawrence carr was the only governor who objected to japaneseamerican internment camps during world war 2 . can you believe that ?"
14673,no . that is pretty crazy
14674,"not crazier than austin , tx voting to rename their city dump to fred durst . haha !"
14675,i can't believe they could actually vote to do that . that is wild .
14676,"apparently , the taller presidential candidate has won 75 percent of the time . hope the next person is taller than trump !"
14677,for real . lets start searching .
14678,i just wish they wouldn't make voting so hard for some people and we could have a shot . some people waited for up to 5 hours to vote in georgia .
14679,"that is outlandish . if astronauts can vote from space , surely we can figure it out here on earth . anyway , ive got to go . have a good night !"
14680,do you like to play video games ?
14681,"i do , but i don't play much . do you ?"
14682,"i don't play much either but have an xbox one , i think that game fe can be an interesting choice for a weekend"
14683,did you know playstation 3s are being used to research black holes ?
14684,"they are ? thats amazing , i wonder why they use play stations instead of supercomputers"
14685,the us dept of defense used 1760 ps3's to build a supercomputer because it was cheaper than the alternative !
14686,i see thats a creative solution did you ever play grand theft auto ?
14687,yes ! did you ? i heard the playstation game plays the soundtrack in a cd player .
14688,"i played it but never tried to reproduce the game in a cd player , it was a great game though"
14689,agreed . do you like animals ?
14690,"i do like animals , there are 20 quintillion of them on the planet !"
14691,crazy ! the study of animals is called zoology . wish i studied that more in school !
14692,"i do too , there are many interesting facts like how animals develop white patches on their foreheads once they are domesticated"
14693,also that in 2002 germany was the first country to give animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rights .
14694,"i guess thats a nice thing to do , some people treat animals like trash and its not like they can fight back , especially if they are small and defenseless ."
14695,agreed . what is your favorite animal ?
14696,"my favorite animals are dogs i also like birds , do you have a preference ?"
14697,birds are just oh so fascinating . did you know most birds bones weigh less than their feathers ?
14698,"wow thats interesting , i never knew that about birds although they must have light skeletons in order to fly , must be difficult to fly with a lot of weight on them ."
14699,hummingbirds actually steal spiderwebs to build and repair their nests !
14700,"i bet spiders must hate them then , that sounds messed up , poor spiders after all that hard work . . . ."
14701,i would be pissed if i was a spider .
14702,"i know right , theres not much spiders can do about it so yeah ."
14703,hey did you know that scientists are using ps3's to research the magic of black holes ?
14704,i think those scientists are lying ! they're just playing games on those ps3s ! lol
14705,haha i want that job ! do you play any videogames at all ?
14706,i used to play . not so much now . the us dodloves the ps3 . it used 1760 of them to build a supercomputer because it was cheaper than the alternative . what was the alternative ? ps2s ?
14707,"haha ya it would take 10 , 000 of those probably ! ya i used to play too , i think it's cool you could play the grand theft auto game disc in a cd player to hear the soundtrack"
14708,"changing topics from the mechanical to the biological , did you know that there are about 20 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 individual animals on the planet ? humans beings and their play stations are such a small part of the living world ."
14709,"ah i didn't know that , i wonder what kind of videogames other animals would play ? haha , i do think it's interesting that in germany animals have legal rights , like i wonder what they are , do they have the right to vote , etc haha"
14710,"perhaps they can vote if they have white patches on their foreheads . animals develop white patches on their foreheads when domesticated . i do not have a white patch on my forehead , yet i feel domesticated . do you have a white patch ? there's no shame in it these days ."
14711,"haha let me look in the mirror and check , that is weird , like we have a dog and it is all black with no white patch but what do i know , i'm drinking soda and have the hiccups , i guess that is a leftover from when animals had both gills and lungs apparently"
14712,"you would still have rights in germany though , no matter what holdovers from your ancestors . under the 1912 scottish protection of animals act , the loch ness monster is a protected species ."
14713,do you think that the loch ness monster is real ? i want it to be real and a protected animal but to be honest i really really don't think it is haha
14714,the fictional beast has more protections than i do . i'm envious .
14715,"haha , and more protectinos than the dodo bird who went extinct sadly , i didn't know it was a spieces of pigeon actually"
14716,"the dodo was not terribly clever . australia has some weird creatures , like wild birds that can mimic the sounds of cameras , car alarms , and chainsaws . i wonder if they have australian accents ."
14717,"haha good question , i woudl be scared to be walking , then hearing an austrailian chainsaw , i'd think i was being chased by a murderer only to find it was a harmless bird haha"
14718,the bird might steal something from you to build a nest . hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to build and repair their nests .
14719,"haha the spiders need spider police ! what is crazy is that a bird's skeleton weighs less than the feathers , i wouldn't have thought that was true"
14720,"the bones are hollow , which makes them stronger than if they were solid . sounds funny , i know . how can birds migrate without sleeping ? i wish i could do that ."
14721,"ya i wish i could work while i was sleeping , then i could get paid so much i'd be very productive !"
14722,"i usually sleep when i'm working , so it's close . well , enjoy being one of the 20 quintillion animals on the planet !"
14723,thanks ! hopefully you don't grow a white patch on your forehead if you ever get domesticated !
14724,hey have you heard of the video game fe ? it's for all of the latest video game platforms
14725,i have not ; what's the objective ?
14726,"have you ever played a metroid game ? apparently this is similar , it's a metroidvania style game"
14727,"i'm not familiar ; does that refer to an aesthetic style , or type of game ?"
14728,it's a type of game . basically you run around a level that's huge and then you come back when you get new abilities to parts that were previously locked off
14729,"that sounds stimulating , i imagine there are a lot of animals in the world ?"
14730,yes i think so . even in our world there are about 20 quintillion so i think in the game there must be plenty haha
14731,i wonder if they have constitutionallyguaranteed rights like the ones animals in germany gained in 2002 .
14732,yes i wonder that too . and what kind of rights do they have ? did you hear what hiccups are ? like what they are remnants of
14733,apparently they're an evolutionary holdover from early land animals that had both gills and lungs . i wonder what the loch ness monster would have ?
14734,"that's a good question ! does the loch ness monster have hiccups haha . but it is interesting that scotland passed a protection act to keep the loch ness monster safe back in 1912 , do you think it exists ?"
14735,"if it ever was real , it's got to be extinct now . did you know that the extinct dodo bird was actually a subfamily of pigeon ?"
14736,no i didn't know that . i also didn't know that animals will develop a white patch on their forehead once they are domesticated
14737,"that's interestingseems like a pretty useless adaptation , though . some wild birds in australia have adapted to mimic the sounds of cameras , car alarms , and chainsaws ."
14738,that is cool . i wonder if anyone been fooled by them ? i also think it's cool that hummingbirds will steal a spider web and make a nest out of it lol
14739,they are some clever creatures . i wonder how the birds that migrate from alaska to mexico without sleeping pull that off ? that's a neat trick .
14740,yes i wish i could stay awake that long . i also wish my bones were hollow and light because then maybe i could fly haha .
14741,"yes , in most birds the feathers actually weigh more than the entire skeleton . i wonder how much the eggs weigh females down before they lay them ?"
14742,"that's a good question ! i wonder if they can even fly if they are full of eggs ? on a different topic , do you play any video games ? for instance like on the playstation"
14743,"i never got the hang of it , but the technology aspect of it interests me ; for example , the dod used 1 , 760 ps3's to build a supercomputer ."
14744,"that's impressive ! especially because it was cheaper then to build an actual supercomputer , also did you know that playstation 3s are also used to research black holes ?"
14745,what are your thoughts on elections ?
14746,there good for the people as long as they aren't rigged ! !
14747,"well it seems like elections are rigged all the time , i wish we all had the option to vote none of these like in the state of nevada"
14748,"i agree , all of the states should have that option ! its interesting the taller candidate wins most of the time in elections ! 75 percent of the time ! lol"
14749,"that is an interesting fact , 75 percent of the time no kidding . ancient athens had a weird way to appoint their leaders ."
14750,yes appointing by lottery wouldn't work in this day and age ! ! lol
14751,"it wouldn't , voting is a great way to chose a leader ."
14752,did you know astronauts vote from space ! ! no excuse ! ! lol
14753,"no , didn't know about that , well 34 percent of the black male population in alabama lost their right to vote ."
14754,that's true . not all men had to right to vote in the uk until 1918 .
14755,so voting has changed a lot over the years we know vote to change the name of a garbage dump .
14756,"poor fred durst , who would want the name for a garage dump ?"
14757,"they must hate him a lot in austin , tx , go through so much trouble ."
14758,must be ? indian government will set up polling booths in the forest full of lions for a single vote ! who knew ?
14759,i guess they take their voters real seriously there sounds like a lot of trouble for a single vote .
14760,crazy with lions ! ! did you know queen elizabeth 2 was pranked called by a radio station pretending to be the prime minister of canada !
14761,"that so funny , i bet she was angry after hearing she was pranked call and i bet the radio station got sued ."
14762,"yes , how would you like to get a silver cup if you live to 100 in japan ?"
14763,"that would be nice , you would have to get to a hundred years old first but that sounds like a nice detail ."
14764,"yes , but japan has so many people living to 100 , they have to give cheaper cups ! lol good chat ! !"
14765,"life expectancy is a lot higher over there i guess , its been a great chat thanks a lot ."
14766,do you think its fair how india is treating prime minister trudeau ?
14767,i'm not sure . i'm not a fan of trudeau but modi should at least greeted him . can you see gandhi doing that ?
14768,"gandhi is all about peace and respect so no , not really , i think they should treat him better , he is a visitor from a foreign country and deserves respect"
14769,"yeah , the trudeaus had to go on their tours alone . they dressed in ethnic indian clothes but modi wasn't there ."
14770,"i guess there is a lot of controversy about this issue , so prime minister , the head of a cabinet , sounds like a really big responsibility"
14771,there are reports that this trip is an election thing for trudeau . he wants the sikh vote in canada .
14772,"what are your thought on this ? i dont care much about politics really , it seems like trudeau is a good leader but there are also controversies surrounding him"
14773,it's a thing between india wanting trudeau to distance himself from sikh separatists and trudeau wanting their votes . i really don't have an opinion . hope they can work it out .
14774,"i hope that too , theres an interesting fact about japan and when you turn 100 the prime minister sends you a silver cup to celebrate it ."
14775,"yeah , that's cool . meanwhile in australia , the pm's not even defined in their constitution ."
14776,really how can that be ? the prime minister is the ruler of australia ?
14777,they just go with it being a ' custom ' . doesn't seem like a solid foundation for government .
14778,"it seems like a fragile government , its funny how a radio station pranked called queen elizabeth ii"
14779,"hee . it's also funny that since 1900 , the taller candidate won the presidency 75 percent of the time ."
14780,"it is a cool fact , height must influence us in a subconcious level , that sounds like an advantage"
14781,"i wouldn't know , i'm 5'11 ' . did you know astronauts vote from space . that leaves no excuses for me . . ."
14782,"i agree if they can vote from space i guess we also have to do our part , there is a dump in austin texas called fred durst , that is kind of messed up lol"
14783,"yeah , not exactly complimentary . . . it's sad that the turnout for presidential elections hasn't exceeded around 63 percent in the last 100 years ."
14784,that is sad and thats how we end with a president like trump .
14785,i think trump's done a great job . maybe that's why people shouldn't talk about politics . let's talk about the chief mouser in the uk's pm instead .
14786,i agree but i respect your opinion thats why democracy exists right ?
14787,hello there . do you like to vote ?
14788,hey . yes i do . even astronauts in space vote ! how about you ?
14789,i was up in space but i forgot to vote . i overslept . oh well . my bad .
14790,haha i'd say you'd get a pass . not on earth though ! i wonder why 34 percent of black men in alabama have permanently lost the right to vote ?
14791,i figure that it has to do with criminal convictions . maybe other stuff that the police trump up . voting is a human right .
14792,agreed . i know a law was recently passed to allow certain convicts or criminals the ability to vote .
14793,good . the right should never disappear . few people vote anyway . we need people to vote . the people that dont vote should be criminals .
14794,semiagree . people also have the right to choose not to partake .
14795,in some countries you must vote or you pay a fine . that is the way to make people vote . also you could choose ' none of the above ' or write in a candidate .
14796,that's why i'm glad to be in america . i wouldn't want to live in a country that ' makes ' you do things with penalty .
14797,i dont understand . the aca still exists . the turnout for elections is low in this country . i would people to vote . what should we do ?
14798,"mind your business ! haha that's what you do . worry about yourself and your own . that's the problem with society , everyone is worried about everyone else but themselves ."
14799,"ok , i dont follow . people vote for politicians and laws . do you not want that ? minding your own business means not voting ?"
14800,mind your own business about people who don't choose to vote .
14801,it is not much of a democracy or a representative govt if people dont vote . by not voting they give up power that people fought hard to get .
14802,so punish them is the answer ?
14803,"getting people to participate in a democracy is important for democracy . you can call it a punishment , but you can always write in a name of someone else . rights come with responsbilities ."
14804,"so make counting votes more difficult by forcing people to come in to write ridiculous nonsense ? if you make me come in to vote , i'm writing donald duck on the line . even though the turnout hasn't breach 63 percent in the last years , that's still a good enough turn out to elect an official ."
14805,"it wont be more difficult to count votes . it really is not a matte of logistics . you can take pride in not participating in democracy . you will get officials , but will they represent the people ?"
14806,the votes needed to be counted and recounted last election . add at a minimum 35 percent more votes and now you have 100 percent of the people voting . not all 100 percent of the people are sound in mind and values in making a decision like that anyway .
14807,"yes , so then who should vote ? who should decide who gets to vote ? i would not want to say whether you could vote or not . i should not have that power over you . if the vote counting system is flawed , it should be fixed ."
14808,you're missing the point . everyone can vote until they choose not to or lose the right because they are a violent offender .
14809,"the prime minister sure has an important job , running a country , being a leader is not easy ."
14810,yeah the prime minister job is to manage the civil service and execite the diretives of the head of state .
14811,"yeah in many systems he also selects many members of the cabinets , the prime minister is the chairman of this cabinet in many systems as well ."
14812,the prime minister of australia position isnt in the constitution . it exists only through custom .
14813,they should change the constitution japan has a primer minister also and when you turn 100 you will get a congratulation card .
14814,i heard that they send you a silver cup when you turned 100 . so many people were turning 100 that they had to find a wasy to get cheaper cups . lol .
14815,"i think thats a great thing , not everyone makes it to that age , so what are your thoughts on elections ?"
14816,i think there is something wrong with us when 2 . 8 percent voter turnout for the presidential election is ridiculous . it hasnt reached over that number in 100 years .
14817,"and thats how trump got elected lol there is something wrong i agree also the taller candidate seems to win 75 percent of the time , looks like we just vote for the taller candidate ."
14818,i dont know about that . there is no way ever i would vote for hillary .
14819,"i dont know , she seems like a better choice than trump by no , no offense if you are a trump fan ."
14820,im not offended . did you know nevada has a none of these candidates option while voting . maybe every place should have that and neither one of them would have got elected .
14821,"i didnt know that , but 34 percent of the black male in alabama lost the right to vote permanently ."
14822,"i wonder why that is . maybe because of felonies for some of them , but that seems like a really high number ."
14823,"yeah that seems like a good reason , do you know who fred durst is ?"
14824,yeah the lead singer of limp biscuit . right ?
14825,"yeah the lead singer well in austin tx people voted to rename their garbage dump after him , they must really hate him over there ."
14826,lol that is funny . i was never a big fan but i dont hate him i guess not all men in the uk could vote until 1918much .
14827,"it does seem like a waste of resources though it is funny , and really ? i guess that has changed by now ."
14828,it certainly has changed . i think the world is becoming a much more tolerable place . i love it . well i hop you have a wonderful day .
14829,"i agree , its becoming a better place , i hope you have a wonderful day as well , bye ."
14830,"hi , how are you ? are you interested in elections and voting ?"
14831,"somewhat , i find the ancient elections interesting like the appointment of officials by lottery in ancient athens"
14832,i think they saw the threat of wealth and small groups dominating government . it created the opportunity for outsiders to enter the fray .
14833,yea the ancient athenians believed elections would lead to an oligarchy
14834,i guess they must have encountered that problem and found their solution for their elections . i wonder what we can do nowadays to alter the nature of election .
14835,well nevada has ' none of these candidates ' option on their presidential ballots
14836,"i think that's a good way to register disgust with the field , but i wonder if there is a way to encourage outsiders to enter without worrying about funding ."
14837,i don't think there will be any improvement in the fairness or effectiveness in the us election system anytime soon
14838,"change in the system in the short term is unlikely , but other countries have interesting ways to get people to vote . those might work here ."
14839,yea it's a shame that international electoral observers are blocked from polls like they were in the us back in 2012
14840,"i don't know how that could have happened . i thought they would have the right to observe , but i guess there is no way to prosecute the perpretrators in the us courts ."
14841,"the laws are messed up , in alabama 34 percent of black males have lost the right to vote"
14842,"i wonder if that has to do with criminal conviction or what . when someone is in prison , i understand that they could lose the right to vote . afterward , though ? seems like the sentence is over , so the punishment should end ."
14843,probably a mix of that and voting id laws that prevent 34 percent of black males in alabama from voting
14844,"oh , no id , no vote ? ok . i guess if you have to prove something that is difficult to prove , then effectively you lose the right to vote ."
14845,yea the us isn't accommodating to voters like other countries . in india they set up a polling booth for a single voter in a forrest
14846,that's astonishing . i guess democracy is taken quite seriously there . i wish it were the case in the us .
14847,"yea , voting isn't that important , voter turnout hasn't breached 62 . 8 percent in 100 years"
14848,i don't see that changing until voting is mandatory like in australia . i enjoyed chatting with you . have a good night !
14849,well at least in texas they got to vote the name of the garbage dump to fred durst
14850,"well , good night !"
14851,good night
14852,"hello there , are you much of a hockey fan ?"
14853,i love hockey . what about you ?
14854,yeah i think its cool but i wish i had a hometown team to support . do you have a favorite team ?
14855,i like the columbus blue jackets since i'm from ohio . did you know canada is the only country in the world with two national sports . those are hockey and lacrosse .
14856,"i have not heard of them . no , i didn't know that , very interesting !"
14857,a hockey player was traded for 1 back in 1993 . he went on to win 4 stanley cups .
14858,"that is awesome , i wonder what happened to the person in charge that made that trade lol ."
14859,haha good question . an ice hockey rink remains under a basketball court when switching stadium sports .
14860,yeah i think i have seen the time lapse videos they make of them changing it .
14861,the average hockey player in the nhl will lose up to 8 lbs in one game .
14862,"that is impressive , they do wear a ton of heavy stuff and skating around that long is hard to do ."
14863,it's a very tough sport to play and you have to have a ton of endurance .
14864,"yeah you sure do , i have never played actual ice hockey , just roller hockey in the streets as a kid ."
14865,ice hockey is a lot of fun . do you like horses ?
14866,"i do like horses , my aunt does show horses . how about you ?"
14867,i love horses . i've ridden them a few times in the past .
14868,"i have only gone riding once when i was really young , it was really fun though ."
14869,icelandic horses have a fifth speed . it's called speedwalking for a horse .
14870,"that is pretty cool , i would like to see a video of that ."
14871,that would be cool to see .
14872,"yeah it would , hey it was nice talking with you , i hope you have a good day !"
14873,"hello , how are you ? what do you think of horses ? did you know that horses in iceland have a fifth speed , called tolt ?"
14874,i think i watched a documentary on them ! it was really neat . do you watch golf at all ?
14875,no i don't . i have watched a little hockey though . it's the national sport of canada .
14876,i love hockey . it's alot of fun to watch . i guess jimmy fallon likes alex ovechkin too !
14877,"oh yeah ! i think he was on the show with mike smith , the jockey of the justify ."
14878,"when you were talking horses , did you know all throughbreds can trace their lineage back to one horse ?"
14879,i didn't know that ! i wonder what it looked like .
14880,maybe it would be on google ? the name is darley arabian . i should look it up !
14881,should have known it would have arabian in it . those are beautiful horses ! lipizzaners are too ! did you know that they are actually born black or brown and it takes up to 6 years before they turn white ?
14882,i had no idea ! did you know horses are ticklish ! what a thing to know !
14883,no i didn't know that but it's a little funny to think about ! thinking about hockey from earlier i remembered that there's more than one type of hockey . most of the planet thinks of hockey as field hockey whereas canada and the u . s . think of it as ice hockey .
14884,true ! the us hockey team lost to a england high school team !
14885,are you serious ? ! that's bad ! canada is supreme though in hockey . in the first olympic winter games in 1924 they scored 132 goals .
14886,wow ! hockey also only had 1 shared penalty box ! imagine the fights !
14887,true enough ! the game is great exercise though . players lose a lot of weight during a game .
14888,i imagine in water weight alone ! did you know the tshirt was invented on 1904 ?
14889,i didn't know that . was it invented in the u . s . ?
14890,i think so . it was invented for bachelors who couldn't sew !
14891,i guess that would make sense ! it's as practical as people in hawaii wearing aloha shirts instead of suits and ties .
14892,very true ! that plain grey shirt that zuckerburg wears ? 300 . i should introduce him to hanes !
14893,"i know that's right ! hey , did you know that polo shirts were actually invented for tennis ?"
14894,"i did know that ! really weird , but yes ! did you know that sunlight determines the length of horses hair ?"
14895,hello ! are you a hockey fan ?
14896,to be honest i am not but my boyfriend is a huge hockey fan . all i know about hockey is that an ice ring remains under basketball courts when switching stadium sports .
14897,yes that is interesting ! i can't believe canada scored 132 goals during the first winter olympics !
14898,that is an insane amount of goals . i believe canada is the only country in the world with two national sports lacrosse and ice hockey .
14899,two totally different sports in a sense ! i think i should play some hockey to lose weight . most people lose 8 lbs while playing it .
14900,hockey is physically demanding so i believe you can lose that much weight . i am more into fashion . did you know that polo shirts were invented for tennis and then later adopted by polo players ?
14901,i didn't know that but totally believe it ! clothing did come a long way though . the whole popping collars thing started in china !
14902,that is right ! during the cultural revolution gang fashion involved layering as many shirts as you could .
14903,i think the most i could do is three lol . that isn't for me for sure ! i wish i lived in hawaii though when it came to fashion .
14904,"oh i believe you're talking about the official business and office attire in hawaii is the aloha shirt instead of the suit and tie , right ?"
14905,i am ! i wish i saw billy may's funeral possession to see those blue shirts and khaki pants !
14906,a very relaxed feel for a funeral indeed ! do you know the difference between a button down and a button up ?
14907,i do ! i'm more of a button up guy !
14908,another passion of mine is riding horses . have you ever rode a horse ?
14909,i actually did once in the rocky mountains haha it was so much fun ! i didn't realize dalmatians calmed down horse at fire stations back then .
14910,i wonder why they're able to calm a horse . i rode my horse to school one time with my father's blessing of course . unlike two high school students who rode their horses to school and got suspended for it .
14911,that would have been a sight to see ! i used to see people drive their tractors to school where i am from lol .
14912,it was so much fun . i am sure riding tractors is fun too . i can't go near horses too much because of my allergies . clint eastwood had a mid life allergy to horses . it's a shame because he was horse back riding in many of his movies .
14913,i think he used to always ride them in movies too haha . i wonder if they could speed walk like icelandic horses can .
14914,icelandic horses are so interesting . lipizzaner horses are cool too because they are born black or brown and it takes about six years for them to turn completely white .
14915,that is an awesome fact ! well have a great night !
14916,"hey there , do you like horses ?"
14917,"hey there , or should i say , hay there ? i like horses , but not shoveling horse . i also have an allergy to horsehair , like by idol , clint eastwood . are you an equine fancier ?"
14918,"i am indeed , i really like horses . did you know that in iceland horses have a fifth speed which is speedwalking ."
14919,icelandic ? isn't that the same area of the globe that gave us speed skating ? do the horses have to wear those skintight outfits too ?
14920,hahha that would be funny and uncomfortable . hopefully they get to hang out with dalmatians there
14921,"if one dalmatian is known to calm the horse , are 101 dalmatians even more relaxing ? not from my experience . . ."
14922,yeah i guess they have that power over horses . good for them .
14923,"you know , i just learned that lipizzaner horses are born balck or brown , and then turn white over a number of years . kind of like me . i always told my wife i was a special breed . i just didn't realize i had lipizzaner in my genes . . ."
14924,hahhaa that is funny . two students were suspended for riding horses to school once .
14925,the horses were still allowed to attend classes though . they were members of the polo team . did you know that polo shirts were originally designed for tennis players ?
14926,i think rene lacoste made them popular in tennis
14927,i prefer the authentic business attire of hawaii : the aloha shirt .
14928,"yes me too . much better than a suit and tie , those are not comfy"
14929,neigther are the button down collared shirts . give me no collar or no shirt !
14930,"yeah true . did you know why they wore them in china , the collar ones ?"
14931,"oh how interesting , do you know why ?"
14932,gangs apparently wore multiple shirts and popped the collars
14933,nice bit of trivia that one . here's another : the average professional hockey player will lose 8 lbs in one game .
14934,wowww that is amazing . do you know who is that hockey player that was traded for 1 and won four stanelys ?
14935,no . but he was likely from canada . hockey is a national sport there .
14936,"yeah and canada is the only country int he world with two national sports , the other being lacrosse"
14937,"they get to have two official , winter , sports because they don't have a summer . nice chatting with you !"
14938,"hi , how are you ?"
14939,good . have you seen wonder woman ? patty jenkins did a pretty good job directing it
14940,"yeah , i really liked it . i thought it added something to the dc space ."
14941,"yea , i really enjoyed gal gadot's performance , she was a great choice"
14942,i agree . i think she was the perfect fit . having someone more famous would have taken away from the movie and placed it on them .
14943,i'm surprised how good it was considering zack snyder was one of the story writers
14944,what else did he do ? i feel like he bombed some stuff . superman ?
14945,he did superman and batman v superman which was wonder woman's first film apperance
14946,"b vs s was terrible , wasn't it ? well . . . it was panned by the critics . i went in thinking it was going to suck and it was ok . . ."
14947,"it was alright , they tried to cram too much stuff in it . wonder woman did a better job with all the characters and only focused on world war i mostly"
14948,did you see the most recent marvel movie ? with thanos . . .
14949,"yea i saw it on netflix recently , i think thanos was a better villain than david thewlis was in wonder woman"
14950,i haven't had a chance to see it yet so i will look into it this weekend . any other suggestions ?
14951,"i heard kung fu hustle was funny , bill murray really enjoyed it"
14952,ha ! i looked it up on netflix and saw solo was out now too . it's supposed to snow this weekend so i am all for netflix
14953,if you ever heard of bromantic comedies the harold and kumar movies are really funny
14954,yeah . i loved the first one . was there a second one ? i think i saw that one and wasn't impressed with it . . .
14955,"there are 3 harold and kumar movies , i saw the first two and some of the third one when it was on tv a couple months ago"
14956,nice . i also need to check out the second super troopers . . .
14957,yea me too . pineapple express is another funny movie if you've never seen it
14958,"i have seen it , great ! nice chatting with you !"
14959,"cool , hope you find some good movies"
14960,later . . .
14961,"hello how are you doing ? did you watch wonder woman ? not only is wonder woman the highestgrossing superhero origin movie , it is also the highestgrossing wwi movie"
14962,"wow , i didn't know that . no , i didn't see it but would like to though . i heard gal gadot is good ."
14963,"it is a great movie ! gal gadot , the new wonder woman , served two years as a soldier in the israel defense forces ."
14964,"that is awesome ! i guess she didn't even know she was auditioning for that part , she thought she way trying out for a catwoman role ."
14965,"yeah lol when wonder woman first appeared as a member of the justice society in 1941 , the group made her their secretary ."
14966,"that is funny , did you know 2017 had the 3 highest grossing movies , and they were starring females ?"
14967,that is an awesome fact !
14968,"yeah , sorry my grammar was a bit off , but yeah very cool . i didn't know chris pine was in the movie as well ."
14969,yeah i think i remember him being in it .
14970,"are you a fan of comedy movies ? i love 80's comedies myself , well and 90's and so on i guess ."
14971,i love comedy movies as well !
14972,nice ! i guess the hangover is considered a bromantic comedy .
14973,"lol that was a great movie ! demetri martin was accepted into harvard law , but left out of boredom to pursue a career in comedy"
14974,that is an interesting fact . on that not ryan stiles dropped out of high school to pursue a comedy career .
14975,he is so good on that show ' whose line is it anyway '
14976,"yeah he really is , i used to watch that show all the time ."
14977,"3rd rock from the sun won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997 , beating seinfeld , friends , and frasier ."
14978,that is some strong competition . seinfeld is one of my favorites and still is .
14979,friends is probably my favorite out of those .
14980,that is a good one as well . i like always sunny in philly now as a good comedy .
14981,that is a hilarious show ! anyways good talking to you
14982,did you see the wonder woman movie ?
14983,i did and thought it was great and you ?
14984,me too . it is the highest grossing superhero origin movie
14985,yes and also the highest grossing wwii movie
14986,nice . also 2017 was the first year that had highest grossing movies with female leads
14987,yeah and that is since 1958 so a long time really
14988,yes . gal gadot was in the israeli defense forces prior to that
14989,i am sure that must have helped with the role
14990,i bet but she did not know she was auditioning for women women when she showed up
14991,yes she thought she was auditioning for catwoman
14992,yeah . do you know what her role was when she first became a member of the justice society ?
14993,yes she was the secretary when he joined them
14994,yeah . do you like comedy ?
14995,i love it . did you know demetri martin dropped out of harvard to become a comedian ?
14996,"same with ryan stiles , he dropped out of high school"
14997,"yes but overall , they both did really well so no regrets there"
14998,true . do you know which movie bil murray thinks is the funniest ?
14999,"yes that would be kung fu hustle , i do not see it how though"
15000,me either . do you like 3rd rock from the sun ?
15001,yes it won a golden globe beating shows like friend to it . nice chatting with you
15002,"same here , have a good one"
15003,"hi , have you read lucifer ?"
15004,"no , i haven't , it sounds a little scary ?"
15005,right ? i am not a big fan of scary for fun .
15006,i do like comic books and spiderman though ! how about you ?
15007,i do like superheros so yes . although i havent opened a comic book in years .
15008,did you know michigan state library has the worlds largest collection of comic books ? who knew ?
15009,that is a weird thing for them to have . i would think la or something that has ore to do with comics . dc means detective comics .
15010,i was surprised too of all places ! i didn't know that google purchased the name gmail . com from garfield comics . i love garfield and the gang ! lol
15011,really ? that's weird . why did garfield have it ?
15012,did you know mj tried to buy marvel comics in the early 1990's ?
15013,mj ? michael jackson ?
15014,"yes , so he could play spiderman in his own produced movie . i' m sure would have been a winner !"
15015,"anytime i'm down , i think of him setting his head on fire in that pepsi commercial and it brings a smile to my face !"
15016,"lol , i know that was something ! he's getting pretty bad press on the latest movie . i haven't seen it yet . i think it will be upsetting . speaking of fires , like eddie van halen's speakers when he played beat it !"
15017,"i can't do voluntary sadness , especially since i had two kids . i heard that movie was disturbing . have you seen the other movie on netflix where parents let their kids stay with like a 40 year old ?"
15018,"no , sound irresponsible , these poor children ! ! i agree with the voluntary sadness . but we need to know whatever the truth is . if we even really get the truth at times ! do you like animals ? i'm not surprised they have a dominant side like humans with their paws ."
15019,i do like animals . i live with 2 cats ; im not a fan but love dogs !
15020,"i have two garfield cats . i love them to bits ! ! i have a dog also , love them all ! i like the idea of having a lawyer to represent animals like they do in switzerland !"
15021,doesn't germany give them full constitutional rights ?
15022,i'm not sure ? if so that's great ! i think i heard something about that ?
15023,it was great chatting with you !
15024,"seventyfive million dollars is a lot of money for a film , wouldn't you say ?"
15025,it is quite a bit . that can easily be made up at office if it is good though .
15026,"well , anything having to do with marvel usually goes over big !"
15027,so true ! shockingly marvel sold almost all of its characters for only 25 million ! considering how much that is worth now thats crazy
15028,"yah , and i can't believe sony rejected all but spiderman !"
15029,spiderman has had such a weird run though . all those reboots and the broadway play that failed
15030,true . they have gotten a lot of mileage out of spiderman .
15031,certainly . they must have run out of ideas because they made cap'n crunch battle him .
15032,"so funny ! lol ! bottom of the barrell , ya think ?"
15033,just a little bit . i'm sure that was during the 90s superhero slump
15034,what do you think about ' lucifer ' that mike carey wrote ?
15035,i haven't read the comic book but i am super interested in his new book someone like me .
15036,"yah . everyone likes ghost stories , right ?"
15037,i love horror and ghost stuff . this seems like a really interesting take on ghost stories too
15038,"' lucifer ' tho , was one of his best selling comics ."
15039,true . that and hellblazer both seem interesting .
15040,"carey's main deal is novels , surprisingly instead of comics ."
15041,yeah i would guess comics because that seems to be where he started but his novels seem very popular too
15042,i think the success of ' the girl with all the gifts ' is because a lot of people actually go through that .
15043,i'm sure he'll have a lot of success just like neil gaiman did
15044,' someone like me ' is so real also because abuse is so real in this world .
15045,very true . i'm also interested
15046,"i read about soundtrack , poems , and elections"
15047,me too . i didn't know that steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack !
15048,"i know , and the info about daft punk discussing the tron soundtrack over pancakes while suited up blew my mind ."
15049,"and how about phil collins recording in five languages the tarzan soundtrack , that is amazing . i wish i knew more than one language ."
15050,i was equally amazed to learn that the japanese alphabet forms a poem
15051,"i write poetry myself . and i have read the poem that is depressing reading forward yet inspiring when read backwards , it was all over facebook ."
15052,i write poetry too . i had no idea it went back so far .
15053,"yeah , i find poetry to be a great outlet for my feelings . did you see that edgar allan poe only got 9 for the raven . though i am sure back in that day 9 was a lot ."
15054,"it might have been worth a bit more , but i don't think money was ever worth even 10x more than it is today"
15055,"i love the raven , that and the tell tale heart . poe is genius ."
15056,"yes , when i originally read the tell tale heart in middle school my young mind was blown . can you imagine winning an election by lottery that you didn't even want to be part of ?"
15057,oh i know that would be insane . i cannot believe that they didn't believe in elections .
15058,it makes sense to me . i think they were on to something with their fear of oligarchy .
15059,yeah but what if the person elected didn't want to be in charge ? nevada is awesome with the ' none of these ' options on ballots . i think all ballots should have that option .
15060,how about 75 percent of taller candidates winning all elections ? i found that bit particularly fascinating
15061,i think taller people look more trustworthy and powerful .
15062,i wonder what an ' international electoral observer ' is . i've never heard of that . . .
15063,i have never heard of an ' international electoral observer ' either . is that a person in a different country who is observing our elections here ?
15064,"that's what i would think , but i never learned about such a thing in civics class or anything ."
15065,i haven't either .
15066,"overall , i learned a lot that i didn't already know"
15067,"hey have you heard of the documentary monrovia , indiana ?"
15068,"no , i have not . is it good ? why is there a documentary about monrovia ?"
15069,"haha well it's about smalltown america and it does sound pretty boring , it takes place in a town that has only a 1400 person population"
15070,they are being punished ? why do they live there ? no choice ? what is the movie about ?
15071,"they're not being punished it's just looking at their lives in the aftermath of the 2016 election , i don't know it doesn't really interest me , what do you think about elections in general though ?"
15072,i think that the people in monrovia probably voted for trump . did they ? i expect they did .
15073,yeah i think that's what it sounds like . did you know that in ancient athens they would do a lottery instead of a direct vote for their leaders ?
15074,i would buy many lottery tickets then to win the leadership . i wonder how many tickets it would take .
15075,"well i would at least help with voter turnout i think , it's shocking that the united states has maxed out at around 63 percent for presidential elections"
15076,"i think that they cannot make money when they vote . if they get money , then they would vote ."
15077,"yeah that is possible . there should be a day where you don't have to work and that is the day that voting takes place , what do you think about the nevada option to vote for ' none of the candidates '"
15078,i think that every election should have such a choice . i would then run as ' none of the candidates ' and get elected . i would win !
15079,haha that's a good idea ! why do you think that international observers were blocked from looking at polling locations in 9 us states ?
15080,i think that the international observers were planning to get in the way of something and americans weren't going to stand for it . why were they there anyway ?
15081,i guess they just look at the elections make sure they're fair . but i don't know why they would not have been allowed . it's interesting that democracy has been the way to elect most politicians and most of the civilized country since about the 17th century
15082,"i guess that democracy could work if there were a lottery for people like me . a random person could get chosed to be the president , they wouldn't have to run or nothing , just wait till their number got called and bam ! president !"
15083,"haha that would make a great reality show i think . by the way , do you ever read poetry"
15084,i do not read poetry as a rule because it runs counter to my orientation .
15085,"haha well i don't really like poetry either , but i do like edgar allan poe's poem the raven , unfortunately he only got 9 for writing it"
15086,"he probably should have worked on his penmanship and then he would have got more money for the poem . anyway , i have to run . i have to go to my poetry reading ."
15087,"haha i will make sure to read demetri martin palindrome poem , it only has 224 words"
15088,did you know taht in ancient athens they did a lottery to appoint their leaders ?
15089,"i heard that ! it was to avoid oligarchy , kind of like the problem we have now in the us . power is in the hands of the few !"
15090,"that is true , what is weird is taht in 2012 international election officials were blocked from the polls in 9 states"
15091,i think it's strange that observers can't watch an election in the us . what were they hiding there ? probably something fishy like fraud . shades of the 2000 election .
15092,"ya i don't like that at all , but elections are crazy , since 1900 the tallest candidate has always won at least 75 percent of the time"
15093,that could explain why trump got elected . maybe the dems should choose an nba player . then the odds would be better .
15094,haha not a bad idea ! i also like nevada's idea of giving a ' none ' option when voting in their elections
15095,"when the voters are so disgusted with their options , they can show their disapproval . i like it . i think that this next election is going to be interesting . many dems have already declared candidacy . i don't know who's tall enough to win though ."
15096,"haha yes that is how they should pick , just choose the tallest one ! do you like poetry at all ?"
15097,"i'm not a big fan of poetry , but i envy those who can write it ."
15098,"well i envy edgar allen poe , but not the fact that he only got nine dollars for publishing the raven"
15099,nine dollars ? i guess the guy must have had a side job teaching or something to support himself . 9 doesn't buy enough booze for a poet . the javanese alphabet forms a poem . i wonder if that's like the abc song .
15100,"that is interesting , i do like the lord of the rings and apparently all of the hobbits names were taken from an old icelandic poem"
15101,"that sounds like something tolkein would do . he loved language , especially dead ones . frodo , bilbo . hm they sound icelandic ."
15102,"ya you're right , i shoudl read that poem , i think it's called dvergatal but i don't know how thats pronounced haha"
15103,"i want to read the poem that is depressing read forward , but inspiring read backward . sounds quite clever ."
15104,"ya i wonder how that works , kind of like how each track of batman begins is named after a bat , like what kind of bat names haha ?"
15105,it sounds like an odd choice . i guess it's for batnerds . i didn't know that spielberg could play the clarinet . i wonder if he got royalties for playing on the jaws soundtrack .
15106,"haha i bet he does , i did like o brother where art thou , i guess that soundtrack was certified platinum not once but 8 times"
15107,"george clooney lipsyncs to the track . he can't really sing , though his aunt can . the film is a lot of fun , though i don't think it won any awards ."
15108,"ya that movie is under appreciated , i like all of the coen brothers movie personally , what about you ?"
15109,do you like watching documentaries ?
15110,i do . did you see the new one from frederick wiseman about small town america ?
15111,"i haven't seen it , but it seems like it puts an interesting focus on small town america ."
15112,yes . he is a great documentarist . i wonder if it will cause any controversy seeing as its about politics and religion .
15113,"they might , but it's good that he tries to be object , and free of any agendas ."
15114,i like that is shows civic life and he doesn't probe the people who live there . he does not interview them .
15115,i like how he takes things into perspective that i would never see if i were passing through those towns .
15116,same here . do you like listening to soundtracks ?
15117,"i don't really , unless while watching a movie . what about you ?"
15118,sometimes . did you know steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack ?
15119,"no , i did not know that . phil collins also recorded the tarzan soundtrack in five different languages . i have heard the english and spanish versions ."
15120,"that is cool . the o'brother , where art thou ? soundtrack is certified 8 times platinum ."
15121,it must be good then ! i'll have to check it out .
15122,it is good . each of the track titles on the ' batman begins ' soundtrack is the name of a genus or family of bat
15123,"that's cool . wiseman's documentary was compared to poetry . it's interesting how poetry has evolved . it has been around since 25th century bce , the pyramid texts"
15124,poetry is great . it lets people express themselves . edgar allen poe only received 9 for his poem ' the raven '
15125,"wow , that seems kind of sad . i'm interested to check out demtri martin's poem as it has 224 palindromes . i wonder if it even makes sense !"
15126,it would be interesting to read . the javanese alphabet forms a poem if recited in order .
15127,"hmm , i wonder what that means , exactly . i will have to check that out ."
15128,another interesting thing for me to learn is stuff about elections .
15129,apparently the concept of elections was around in ancient athens but they thought that elections would lead to an oligarchy so they used a lottery instead .
15130,"hi , how are you ?"
15131,i am good . do you like to read fiction ?
15132,i prefer nonfiction but i do read fiction . do you enjoy reading it ?
15133,i try to read a little bit of every genre . the longest piece of fiction written is a 4 million word super smash bros brawl fan fiction . i'm not sure i would have the patience to read through it all .
15134,i know i do not have the patience to read it . could you write that much ?
15135,"i do not think so . i think i would have a better chance of writing a drabble , a work of fiction that is exactly 100 words long ."
15136,did you ever read l . ron hubbard ? my dad had all the books but i never read them .
15137,i have not . i do know his work is based on the belief of scientology where as others view it as science fiction .
15138,didn't he create the religion ?
15139,i cannot say . i am not familiar with his works . i know a bit more about science fiction films . i have seen films ranging from a space odyssey to star wars .
15140,i was just watching the last jedi on the treadmill today ! what's your favorite movie ?
15141,"i have so many favorites and a huge appreciation for films . i really did enjoy the movie the fifth element . it came out the same year as contact , gattaca , men in black and starship troopers . have you seen any of those films ?"
15142,i saw starship troopers and thought it was ok . also saw men in black . went to that ride in universal too !
15143,"that is so fun ! i am not a big fan of horror films are you ? et was supposed to be a horror move , i am very glad it was not ."
15144,"i am not either . i get too scared ! although if i knew you could burn calories watching it , i may change my mind !"
15145,there wasn't a single person involved in filming the original exorcist that thought it was a horror film . i have a very different view as an audience member !
15146,i have never seen that movie . i won't watch it . seems really scary to me .
15147,you are smart . stick with movies like inception that was supposed to be a horror film but evolved into a heist film .
15148,"as you say im smart , you choose the one movie i cannot follow along with . i guess i am not that smart . . ."
15149,yes you are . you helped me learn a lot about fiction today . thanks for chatting !
15150,ditto ! have a great day !
15151,"hello , what kind of movies do you like ?"
15152,i like comedy and some science fiction . how about you ?
15153,"what kind of comedy do you like ? speaking of science fiction , did you know that nasa has their space vocabulary in science fiction ."
15154,"just anything that i can relax and take my mind off things with . interesting , they also have named gattaca as the most accurate science fiction film of all time . have you watched it ?"
15155,do you have a favorite comedian ? gattaca ? that sounds like a star wars movie .
15156,"i am not really into favorite actors and such , no . how about you ? speaking of accurate science fiction , some people really take that type of thing seriously . you can get an mit science fiction society membership that covers you in case you die and come back to life ."
15157,you should check out jokoy ! he is a funny guy ! that is interesting .
15158,"oh yeah ? i haven't heard of him . an actor i have heard of is deep roy . he is the only actor to have appeared in star wars , star trek , doctor who . he has also been in xfiles , neverending story , and transformers ."
15159,"he's a filipino comedian . wow , i do not even recognize him ."
15160,"i know , i don't either but i just know that he's been in all those films ! do you like science fiction at all ? fan conventions are very lucrative for science fiction stars . they can make more than 100 , 000 per weekend signing autographs and taking pictures ."
15161,i do not like science fiction at all . the only thing about it that i like is star wars . that is crazy . i want to be famous .
15162,"haha , right ? well , science fiction has been popular since the era of silent cinema !"
15163,isn't there another star wars movie coming up ?
15164,"i am not sure . is there ? i am looking forward to watching lego movie 2 , haha !"
15165,i almost forgot about the lego movie ! now i'm looking forward to it .
15166,"yeah , because everything is awesome ! haha ! i would much rather watching the lego movie 2 than horror movies . what about you , do you like horror movies"
15167,i played star wars lego game on the gamecube . i only like it .
15168,"if you watch horror movies , you can burn up to 180 calories ! should that be my new exercise plan ?"
15169,is it because of the screams ? did you know that you lose 20 calories when you laugh ?
15170,i did not know that ! i will try to laugh more often !
15171,get in the positive vibe ! it was nice chatting with you .
15172,are you a fan of ficton ?
15173,"yes , i like fiction . i like science fiction too ."
15174,did you know there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters ?
15175,i haven't heard of that . sounds interesting . i wonder how they rank them .
15176,"it does , they rank them by their powers and abilities . pretty cool , huh ?"
15177,that is cool . did you know that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character ?
15178,"no , really ? that's sort of weird . apparently julius caesar wrote fiction too ."
15179,he was a thoughtful and ambitious ruler . and he conquered a vast swath of the world as well . i wonder what he wrote about .
15180,"that he was . i think it wasa about hercules and oedipus , ever heard of them ?"
15181,"yes , that is interesting . i would expect hercules , but oedipus ? hm . maybe he had some odd interests ."
15182,"what about science fiction , do you follow it ?"
15183,i read it when i was younger . i liked asimov . i don't read much now .
15184,"i read a book by asimov , he was pretty good ."
15185,he wrote the foundation series . he was a prolific writer . loved to grind out prose .
15186,did you know nasa named gattaca as the most accurate science fiction film ?
15187,i saw that film a while ago . accurate ? in what way ? i think that it's scary to think that we'll all get engineered and nothing will be natural .
15188,"i'm not sure , i've seen it too . i don't believe that statement at all . lol"
15189,"yeah , some of the facts floating around seem a bit sketchy . i do believe that nana has a list of accurate space technology terms that writers can use in science fiction stories . that would be easy to do ."
15190,"what about horror films , do you watch them ?"
15191,i like a couple of them . the exorcist . the omen . the shining .
15192,"i'm not a huge fan , but when i was younger i liked them ."
15193,do you like nike products ?
15194,i have a few pair of nike shoes as well as nike running shorts . i am aware of the backlash nike has been receiving as of late but i still prefer to be comfortable despite what the label may host .
15195,yeah ? but i think they exploit things ? 515 for a wind breaker and 229 for a mesh shirt designed by mathew williams that they possibly had made in china by some sweat shops ! i think those are ridiculous prices !
15196,i agree the pricing is crazy but people will pay that for a look they wish to achieve despite the fact that the article of clothing at hand may be of gang relations or just a simple shirt made to cover one's torso .
15197,yeah . . for sure ! i guess i can't blame nike . . . so they are just trying to make a profit ! just seems like the exploitation of young people that adore the brand thats all
15198,i agree with that as well . it seems the next big fad is around the corner and any brand out there is at risk of shaming if not liked by many . i just feel i would rather have a simple polo shirt i can wash and wear not costing me an arm and a leg so i can purchase more than one color . i prefer the simple things .
15199,the simple things . . . i like that ! i wonder why rip curl has their clothes made in north korea but the label states made in china ? lol geez !
15200,"i would think maybe a component of each article may be made in china and finished product in north korea , still uncertain as to why though . i have heard of an interesting place that sells thing lost from air ports in alabama and think it would be cool to visit ."
15201,yeah that would be really cool ! what is a collar gap ?
15202,collar gap is a term used by high end clothing makers to determine the spacing on a shirt collar that has buttons or space between them .
15203,oh . . . interesting . . . would of never even thought of that ! see your simple polo shirt was actually invented for tennis ?
15204,"i am aware of that yes ! i believe that from need comes product being that inventions form from products being needed and not available . for example , certain attire comes from the need of a professional wanting to look the part or a person needing to relax comfortably wears a tshirt ."
15205,i wanna work in hawaii so i don't have to wear suit and tie !
15206,i feel hawaii would be a great place to work as well as experience the cultural differences available . i do think however clothing would need to protect one from the elements there on a full time basis as hawaii does not experience the extreme differences in weather seasons as we do here on the main land .
15207,"that's true , but i wonder if them wearing aloha shirts comes from comfort or tradition ?"
15208,"i feel it would be a part of both aspects . one looking for comfort from the heat elements of the area they are in as well as be somewhat fashionably forward with the time in question , moreover ; protecting one from environmental elements ."
15209,"so , how many polo shirts you have ?"
15210,i have a few on hand but being in the professional field i am in i seldom have the chance to wear them . i for certain prefer the simple comforts but forced to uphold the professional look for my field .
15211,"yeah , being a professional and upholding the look is not comfortable and cheap either !"
15212,agreed ! i find i look at clothing as a needed expense it can at times make or break one depending on the situation at hand .
15213,yep . . . well great chat . . . have a good one !
15214,do you like clothing ?
15215,i usually prefer it to being nude . do you like clothing ?
15216,"yeah , i wear it . did you know apple had a clothing line in 1986 ?"
15217,"i wonder how fashionable that was . . . pilgrims were fashionable , wearing colorful clothes ."
15218,"yeah , apparently the black and white was only for formal dress . who knew ?"
15219,they get a bad rap then . all the moview portray them as dull .
15220,"yeah , i agree . what about shirts , do you like them ?"
15221,i am for em ! who doesn't like a cloth garment for the upper body ?
15222,i personally like polo shirts . know anything about them ?
15223,"yes , they were invented by a tennis player . do you know who ?"
15224,i think it was rene lacoste ?
15225,"yes , i can see the connections . his nickname was the crocodile . guess what their logo is ."
15226,"a crocodile ? they are expensive , that is for sure . lol i personally like ralph lauren ."
15227,that's right . lacoste is the name of the clothing line too . ralph lauren doesn't fit me right .
15228,"interesting . i have a similar problem with ralph lauren , even if i get slim fit , it seems baggy ."
15229,i am not sure if you have been 6'6 ' before but nothing fits us .
15230,"nope , 5'10 ' . they have the big and tall , but i suspect that it doesn't work out so well ."
15231,"no . they do not take the same caare for big and tall . the shirts usually end up a big mess of a shirt , the top half too small and lower half too big . big men problems !"
15232,"yup , before the internet was the rage the problem i had was finding my size . everyone wears it ."
15233,too common so it was never in stock ?
15234,"yeah , so you always had to get the wrong size . lol well , nice chatting !"
15235,ditto . have a great day !
15236,do you like comedy ?
15237,i love is . did you know drew carey served 8 years in the military ?
15238,wow cool . do you like kug fu hustle ?
15239,yeah i have seen it . carey used to tell jokes in the military and is how he got started
15240,haha that is awesome . bill murray thinks that is the funniest movie
15241,"wow ok , not sure about that . do you know what slipping on a banana peel was a reference to ?"
15242,"hmm i have not idea , what ? did you know green lanters was supposed to be a comedy ?"
15243,it was in reference to slipping in horse manure . really a comedy ?
15244,haha that is awesome . yeah and starring jack black
15245,wow that would have been a very different movie then
15246,"true , do you like shakespeare ?"
15247,i sure do . did you know he intentionally made mistakes in grammar in his plays ?
15248,"cool , did he have a reason for that ?"
15249,"yes , do that he would get the attention of the audience"
15250,wow that is creative . did you know he lived at the same time as pocahontas
15251,"wow , that is amazing . do you know why the starlings exist in the us ?"
15252,hmmm there is a specific reason for that ?
15253,"yes , one guy wanted to introduce all the birds that were ever mentioned in shakespeare's plays"
15254,wow . do you like meryl streep ?
15255,i love her . do you know her first role was in a sports movie ?
15256,"nice , that is strange though a bit"
15257,"how's it going , do you watch comedy ? i enjoy satire myself"
15258,"yeah i enjoy comedy , to think it has roots that go all the way back to the greeks , funny genre indeed ."
15259,"i've heard kung fu hustle is really funny , at least bill murray seems to think so"
15260,"that movie is so funny , you should watch it , did you ever watch the channel comedy central ?"
15261,"yea , comedy central has cancelled so many shows i found funny"
15262,"yeah that made me real mad , 100 shows in total since its creation in 1989"
15263,"yea , that averages out to 3 shows cancelled by comedy central a year"
15264,that is a lot of them do you know the british comedy group monty python ?
15265,"yea , the creator of python programming named the language in honor of them"
15266,"i thought it was a funny group , do you like william shakespeare ?"
15267,"yea , shakespeare was really talented , he created 39 plays and 154 sonnets"
15268,"yeah talent like that one only comes once in a life time , did you know he was alive at the same time as pokahontas ?"
15269,"makes sense , shakespeare was born around 1564"
15270,"yeah and died in the year 1616 , he was a great poet , actor , writer and his plays have been translated into many languages ."
15271,plus shakespeare coined the phrases ' good riddance ' and ' laughing stock ' too
15272,"he also invented popular names we use to this day like olivia , jessica and miranda . he sure had a big impact in our culture ."
15273,it's pretty crazy that andre tchaikowsky donated his skull to the royal shakespeare company in order for it to be used as a prop
15274,"that is cool , his skull is really famous i guess it was used in a series of performances of the famous play hamlet ."
15275,"yea , i wonder how many shakespeare works meryl streep has been in , she's a great actress and has been nominated for 18 oscars"
15276,"18 oscars , woah thats a lot of them , i wonder how many times she won the award ."
15277,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
15278,good morning to you !
15279,good morning ! do you like comedy !
15280,i love it ! everyone needs a good laugh every now and then . how about you ?
15281,"i am a fan , i love to laugh ! i love stuff on comedy central , especially when they have specials ."
15282,oh me too . have you seen kung fu hustle before ?
15283,"i havent , you ? bill murray thinks it is special ."
15284,i have and it wasnt all that great ! i dont know why bill thinks it was a monumental achievment !
15285,"really , maybe i dont need to see it then ."
15286,i would suggest not ! just like the green lantern film . i think that one would have been better if they had stuck with jack black
15287,it would have been a totally a different movie . jack black is hilarious .
15288,"i love his movies , hes one of my favorite comedic actors for sure"
15289,how did you feel about 3rd rock
15290,3rd rock from the sun ? the tv show ?
15291,yeah it won golden globes in 97
15292,what ! no way ! i was never a huge fan of that show . more of friends and seinfeld fan myself
15293,same here . so much funnier . friends is classic . pivot !
15294,' we were on a break '
15295,ha ! that is the best
15296,love it . did you know comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows ? that really goes to show that a good comedy tv show is hard to come by
15297,"it is , although about 34 a year is what they cancel . so over time it all adds up ."
15298,"oh yea i guess thats less absurd haha . well i'm going to go watch some friends , good chatting with you !"
15299,"hi , how are you this afternoon ?"
15300,good . you ? i'm watching an old meryl streep movie . . .
15301,"i'm good , thanks for asking . i like meryl street , i think she's a good actress ."
15302,did you see her in the deer hunter ? she got an academy award nomination for that .
15303,"no , i didn't see her in that . i remember her in devil wears prada ."
15304,"yes , nice ! she earned a best supporting actress award in kramer vs . kramer . did you see her is that ?"
15305,"yes , i saw that one . she has so many ! hard to believe her first film role was a sports movie ."
15306,"i never saw it . she probably got nominated for that too . after all , she is the most nominated actress ever with like 18 nods . that's more noms than most actresses get roles in their lifetime !"
15307,"i hear ya ! very surprising that although she got nominated so many times , she has only won 3 times ."
15308,tough business . it was nice to see he and stanley tucci reunite in julie and julia ! their performances made me hungry !
15309,"i saw that one too , they were awesome in it ."
15310,"yeah , and since tucci is an excellent cook , he made streep cook for him in preparation for the role as the famous julia childs ."
15311,that's cool !
15312,i wonder what kind of preparation she did for her role in holocaust which earned her an emmy ?
15313,"idk , it was probably something very intense . i'm sure ."
15314,do you know what producer dino de laurentis said after she auditioned for a role in king kong ?
15315,"i heard he said in italian that she was ugly . but , was shocked when she replied back to his insult in fluent italian . how funny !"
15316,"nice . i bet he wishes he could eat those words ! she has even been nominated for 15 british academy awards , which is insane considering the amount of british talent that had to be overlooked ."
15317,"that's so true . on a different note , do you like shakespeare ?"
15318,"it used to be my nickname ! not because i am as old as shakespeare . . . since he was alive during the time of pocahontas , which is a little older than i . what's your take on shakespeare ?"
15319,"i love his works . was shocked to find out that he invented the names , miranda , jessica , and olivia . how cool !"
15320,"that is nice . and they are so popular still today ! on the other hand , nobody is named ' yorick ' anymore ! did you know that tchaikowsky donated his skull to the royal shakespeare theatre in hope of having it used as a prop one day for yorick ?"
15321,"that's very strange indeed . well it's been nice chatting with you this afternoon . hope you enjoy the rest of your day , friend ."
15322,i hear nike got in trouble for selling a balaclava .
15323,i heard about that . critics said the design perpetuated violence with stereotypes of black youth and gang culture . that's sad !
15324,i just thought they were ski masks for using in the cold and snow .
15325,"i agree the company wasn't encouraging the issue of gang or criminal culture . but it's like everyone has to be careful with what they say , do or release these days ."
15326,i thinks more offensive that it sells for 92 . probably cost 1 to make . just because it's got a designer label they can charge that much
15327,"so true . so very , very true . the cost is so ridiculous ! also , i didn't agree with that facebook video that was shared 38 , 000 times either where the guy claimed the item ' looks as menacing as anything i've ever seen ' ."
15328,it just takes one statement to get forwarded to create a scandal . there seem more important things going on in the world to get worked up about .
15329,"so true . i mean , i doubt the pilgrims ever got worked up over any of their wardrobe and it was always full of color !"
15330,"i've never worried too much about clothing , probably about as much as the pilgrims did . my wardrobe is pretty basic , based on cost as anything else ."
15331,so true . i wonder what kind of wardrobe we could find in that alabama store that sells only clothes and cameras found in unclaimed baggage at airports .
15332,"i think that's maybe where i do draw the line . i'd sooner it new than second hand . some of my shirts are getting a little worn , maybe i should get a couple of new ones"
15333,same here ! i need to find a new button down . crazy how they call it a button down because the collar tip fastens to the body of the shirt where button up does not !
15334,we should move to hawaii . if not for the aloha shirt then for the sun and sea !
15335,"ha ! so true . must be nice never having to wear a suit and tie especially when it's hot out . that sounds so much more convenient ! on a related note , the pallbearers at billy mays' funeral didn't wear a suit and tie either , they wore khakis and blue shirts ! ha !"
15336,if that's what you what then fine . i'd love to go to one of those fancy functions like the academy awards in a tshirt and shorts .
15337,no kidding ! are you a fan of apple by chance ? they actually had their own clothing line back in 1986 . wonder what that was like ?
15338,"if i worked there i'd feel obliged to wear it . yeah , i wonder what it looks like , i bet it's not a 229 nike mesh shirt with chest pouch ."
15339,that's the truth . i bet nike products cost more than smaller dinosaur fossils . or that glow in the dark dinosaur coin that canada has !
15340,i'm still waiting for scientists to make dinosaurs come back like jurassic park . then humans could live side by side with them
15341,"i mean , they've managed to genetically alter chickens to express the dna their dino ancestors had , so anything is possible !"
15342,"it'll happen one day , then we could all have a pet trex ."
15343,"so true . ha ! crazy to think dinosaurs were mesothermic , in between warm and cold blooded . must have been nice !"
15344,"hi , do you like fiction ?"
15345,i like some . i have read a lot of science fiction like asimov's ' i robot . '
15346,cool . do you know who wrote the oldest cyborg in fiction ?
15347,not sure . i do know that i was taught asimov's 3 laws of robotics in a robotics course i took in college .
15348,wow that is amazing . nasa apparently has a list of words that writers can use ?
15349,cool .
15350,oh that is sad . do you know which actor holds the science fiction trifecta ?
15351,"again , not sure . i was surprised the l . rob hubbard was a scifi author . he's in the book ' the golden age of science fiction . '"
15352,nice . the actor is deep roy
15353,"never heard of ' deep roy ' until now . wow , the world's longest piece of fiction is 4 million words long . take that tolstoy !"
15354,niceee . do you watch horror movies ?
15355,i watch very few . i can't stand slasher movies but i like stuff like alien . hard to believe e . t . was originally slated to be a horror movie .
15356,yeah that is strange . do you know how they make those scary sounds in those movies ?
15357,don't know . i do know that the 1996 film ' scream ' was originally going to be titled ' scary movie ' . wasn't that title used in a mock horror file ?
15358,they apparently use an instrument called a waterphone . it is so creepy
15359,i like science fiction better than horror even though it got its start with mostly cheesy ' b ' movies .
15360,yeah . have you ever been to a fan convention ?
15361,"no . like groucho marx , i wouldn't belong to a club that would have me as a member . i can't believe no one though the orgiginal exorcist movie would be considered ' horror or"
15362,yeah i was surprised about that too . and did you watch the shining ?
15363,yes . i'll never forger ' red rum ' . . . there is a work of fiction called ' drabble ' that is exactly 100 words long . i wonder what it sold for ?
15364,"oh wow , that is short , what can one say in 100 words ? nice chat : ,"
15365,are you a fan of the science fiction genre of film ? i like it because it uses concepts not fully accepted by mainstream science .
15366,yes i am a fan of science fiction . i especially love the spaceships and interstellar travel of the star trek series .
15367,oh nice yeah that's definitely really cool . nasa has a list of accurate space technology terms that writers can use in science fiction stories .
15368,i've heard that . the writers do a lot of research in order to make the stories as real as possible .
15369,yeah i think that is very important the more realistic it is the more interesting . deep roy is the only actor to hold the sciencefiction trifecta . very cool .
15370,i don't recognize his name though . what all has he been in ?
15371,"yeah actually i don't either . he has been in star wars , star trek , and doctor who . he's also been in xfiles ."
15372,"that's pretty impressive . i've heard that nasa has named gattaca as the most accurate science fiction movie of all time . yet , i've never heard of it either ."
15373,well i really need to look that up . the mit science fiction society has both a lifetime membership and a more expensive one that covers you in case you don't come back . that is pretty funny .
15374,it is ! i wonder how you become a member of that club !
15375,good question i'm not sure . i also really like the horror film genre . it was inspired by a literary authors like edgar allan poe and mary shelley .
15376,"oh , speaking of poe , did you know that he wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg ?"
15377,no i never knew that that was quite interesting . watching horror movies is a very energy intensive task and you can burn up to 180 cal .
15378,"i can believe that ! it probably speeds up a person's heart rate so fast that it's like running . isn't it odd that horror has been around since the days of poe , stoker , and shelley ?"
15379,"yeah very cool . or also overlaps with a fantasy , supernatural fiction , and thriller genres . that makes sense . kind of like a potpourri of genres ."
15380,it does . you can watch a show about aliens and it can be frightening in the extreme . have you heard that watching a horror movie before viewing abstract art makes you like it more ?
15381,no i never knew that but i will have to try it sometimes . the water phone is the instrument that makes those creepy metallic noises in horror movies .
15382,really ? that's interesting . it kind of takes some of the scary out to know just how things are done in movies .
15383,yeah very true . the shining was another scary movie and it was very surprising that the little boy who acted in the movie didn't even know it was a horror film .
15384,true . didn't he find out several years later ? i'd like to know how everyone kept him from knowing the truth for so long .
15385,i would like to know that as well . stephen king found the movie bambi scary as a child . i find that kind of ironic .
15386,do you have a favorite dinosaur ?
15387,"yea , the trex is cool , so are other dinos from the cretaceous"
15388,"t rex is awesome , i like jurassic park movies because of the t rex"
15389,"yea , jurassic park was an awesome movie although i don't think any of the dinosaurs in it were from the jurassic period lol"
15390,"lol , i never knew that ! did you know there have been fossils found in all 50 states"
15391,"that is pretty cool that all 50 states have fossils , i wonder which dinosaur fossils are in alaska"
15392,"or even hawaii , that is far away from anything . 40 percent of americans think that humans and dinosaurs lived at the same time , that seems high"
15393,well technically birds are a type of dinosaur but i don't think the 40 percent of americans knew that
15394,"that is true , i want to know what an actual dinosaur looked like and not what we think it does , that would be amazing ."
15395,"yea , it be pretty cool if there were dinosaurs that glowed in the dark like canada's dinosaur coin"
15396,"that would be awesome , and at least you could see it coming in the dark lol . i never knew dinosaurs were mesothermic"
15397,"i wonder how scientists were able to figure out dinos were mesothermic since we've never seen them , unless they got that info from birds"
15398,i wonder how they have figured anything out or even knew where to start after finding the first one . so mind blowing in my opinion !
15399,"yea , maybe one day they will be able to make a real dinosaur through altered chicken dna"
15400,i would love to see that day ! i would shake in my clothing in excitement
15401,"yea , one day there will be pet dinosaurs and you can buy dinosaur shirts with popped collars like chinese gang fashion"
15402,"lol i was hoping that died out and never again would come back , lets hope one day it doesn't lol"
15403,"i hope the aloha shirt never dies out , it is the official business attire in hawii"
15404,"that is awesome , i own a couple , but never have worn them . i might as well make a trip to hawaii ! it was so great chatting with you !"
15405,"you too , i'm gonna look on ebay for some of the original apple clothing from 1986"
15406,i am going to look in unclaimed baggage like in alabama and see if any are there . enjoy your evening !
15407,"hi , how are you ?"
15408,i'm great ! how are you ? are you a fan of comic books ?
15409,"i am well , thanks . although not a fan of comic books per se , i do love comic book movies like the black panther ."
15410,"black panther , a character created by stan lee , the man who ended every phone conversation with the word ' excelsior ! '"
15411,ha ! i did not know that . what would be the word you ended phone calls with ? i end mine with ' peace out home boy ! '
15412,"i use ' word ' or ' word up , dawg . '"
15413,nice choice . that's in my lexicon too . i wonder what john ashbery uses ?
15414,"he's a poet , so his command of language is far beyond that of us mere mortals . do you know what the dc in dc comics stands for ?"
15415,i do not ? district of columbia ?
15416,"detective comics , so dc comics is detective comics comics ."
15417,"ha ! i never knew that . there is a character that dc and marvel owns , access . . ."
15418,"i don't really know the characters well . i've heard that there is a clark kent in the marvel universe , but he's just a reporter ."
15419,ha ! just a reporter . i do love superman . i did not know they own the trademark on super hero . . .
15420,that sounds like something that the lawyers cooked up . what will they trademark next ? the msu library has the largest comic book collection in the world . the center of all things nerdy .
15421,"i would assume that princeton or yale would have it , some old money college with nothing else to do but collect and strive to reach harvard in status ."
15422,"maybe they'll do that for video games , the next big media boom ."
15423,yeah . there's going to be a time when all the video games are bought online and there will be no more gamestop . . .
15424,"that might be a good thing ! gamestop , as dead as the dodo , a bird that is part of the pigeon family ."
15425,nice transition ! gamestop might as well fly to northern mexico and stay there .
15426,"gamestop could build a nest from spiderwebs , just like the hummingbird does ."
15427,hahaha . nice chatting with you !
15428,i had never heard of john ashbery before . what about you ?
15429,i am not into poetry as much as i should . i did hear that their are some poems that when you read them normally are depressing and when you read them backwards they are inspiring .
15430,that backward reading of poetry was so new to me ! i think that that is really cool .
15431,what is even cooler is that the japanese alphabet forms a poem with recited . that is overwhelmingly detail oriented .
15432,is it japanese or javanese alphabet ?
15433,"javenese , spell check is such a problem ."
15434,that's true ! not to worry . consider this amazing overwhelming and detail oriented concept the demetri martin could write an extended palindrome poem that was 224 words long .
15435,poets definitely don't get paid enough for their creativity and hard work . did you know that edgar allan poe only received 9 for his poem ' the raven ' .
15436,wow ! poor poe do you like comics ?
15437,i liked the archie comics when i was a kid but i enjoy the marvel and dc comic inspired movies and tv shows . i only just found out that marvel owns the trademark for the term 'superhero ' and ' supervillain ' . how can one comic maker own those terms ?
15438,that's interesting fact about the trademark terms . i liked comics too but not really a big marvel fan . stan lee just died and i understand that he always closed his phone messages with the term excelsior ! i wonder if that was added to his epitaph on his grave . ?
15439,i would hope they would give him that epitaph . he made a lot of cameo's in the recent movies . he was a big part of the genera . did you know that the dc of the dc comics stands for detective comics . the are similar but different .
15440,oh that's clever ! dc for detective comics i am learning so much . so the poet and artist ashbery used comics and other bits of ephemera in his collage artworks . i hope some comic collectors don't get upset about this !
15441,i would think they would be fine with the creativity . michigan stae university has the largest comic book collection in the world . i wonder if they have his in their library .
15442,perhaps michigan state does have his in their university library . i would hope so . i do quite like the creativity involved with added bits of incongruous bits of paper and childhood ephemera to create a piece of artwork . i do enjoy collage and childhood memories .
15443,the art of comics is a topic i enjoy . liechtenstein popularized the comic image and gave the art form respect from the fine art world with the pop art movement .
15444,"do you recall the comic or maybe it was a cartoon with two black birds that wear hats ? those were very popular , it has some stereotyped and racist undertones . the only birds i see that i think are comical are pigeons . the dodo bird now extinct is a form of pigeon ."
15445,i do not recall the image you are talking about but it reminds me of the two black birds in the dumbo cartoon movie . definite racial overtures especially with the music .
15446,some people are deathly afraid of birds . i have a friend who is afraid even by one stray feather ! can you imagine ? can you imagine being chased by a bird ? ashley did a collage of that too . a boy being chased by large bird .
15447,i can imagine . the movie the birds is a great example of why we should fear the birds . in ashley's work the boy has returned is very creepy .
15448,yes indeed ! creepy . a bird head . i would like to imagine what it's like to fly as a bird does . light and easy i imagine since the bird bones are hollow and amazingly weigh less than the feathers .
15449,so very interesting . thanks for the conversation .
15450,do you read comic books at all ?
15451,"hey ! when i was a child , i did , but not later . now i would say i don't have interest . how about you ?"
15452,i am sorry but i do not understand what you mean ?
15453,how about you ? do you read comic books ?
15454,"no , not really . i do admire stan lee though ."
15455,i didn't know that google purchased the domain name gmail . com from garfield comics .
15456,"yeah , i believe that got a pretty good deal on the domain . garfield wasn't getting much traffic on the site at the time ."
15457,intetesting ! i'm not comic books as popular as they were 20 years ago . . .
15458,many of them are still worth a great deal of money and there is still a demand for them for sure .
15459,"sorry for typing errors . i need to focus and don't do all at the same time : , in the last message my point was that i'm not sure , but there isn't way to correct message . anyway you got my point lol"
15460,stan lee is an idol of mine and i enjoyed his comic work tremendously .
15461,"captain america was his the first break , right ?"
15462,i thought it was spiderman but i could be wrong .
15463,"i don't know . i remember i've read that his wife destroyed his typewriter during an arguent . i don't know why , but i remember this moment from one article about him"
15464,did he write for marvel or dc comics ?
15465,"i guess marvel . iron man was marvel , right ?"
15466,i thiink so . he has been around comics so long that i bet he was one of the one that wrote the first one in america .
15467,i guess all comics universe could be totally different without stan lee
15468,i loved how he used the term ' excelsior ' .
15469,true . i think there are some many awesome facts about him . i'm wondering is there any book about his life .
15470,i hve one autographed by him .
15471,"hi , how are you ? what do you think of our friend the sun ?"
15472,that he is a real hotty .
15473,"yes , he is . he comes up every day without fail . he is dependable . and usually pretty warm . though he has his off days ."
15474,he is heavy to . about 30000 times as heavy as earth is .
15475,"well , he has tried to keep his weight down , but what is he going to do at his age ?"
15476,the sun looks yellow but it is actually white .
15477,"i figure that he was being misrepresented in some way . boy , that really is unfair . he should be seen for what he is . nothing else ."
15478,you are right . as one white hot ball of burning gas .
15479,he is quite hot . i've heard that the surface is not as hot as we think .
15480,yeah a lightning bolt is 5x hotter .
15481,i wish we could harness the energy of lightning . there must be a way .
15482,do you think a kite and a key could point us in the right direction .
15483,i figure giant towers in areas with lots of lightning . then a big battery to store it .
15484,if it were that easy . i figure it would have been done already .
15485,i guess you're right . i figure that there must be a way though . i wonder how often lightning strikes . it would have to be enough to generate steady energy .
15486,i think solar is more the way to go . if they can make the solar cells cheap enough to make it worth it .
15487,"yes , solar is a better way to go . the energy source is steady and predictable . i wonder how much energy we can squeeze from the old boy ."
15488,well the sun produces enough power in one second to power this planet for 50000 years
15489,you would have to capture all the energy from the sun with a dyson sphere . that would be tricky . then you would have to store it all somehow . also tricky .
15490,we have huge power plants that store massive amount of energy . i think we could figure a way to store it . i think collecting it effeciently is the real problem .
15491,"yes , collection has theoretical limits . plus the material are expensive and quite destructive to mine and fabricate . the sun is a great source of energy , but the challenge is capture ."
15492,i would say we have to figure it out . everything else is unsustainable .
15493,"true . we are entering a difficult time . more people , more demand for energy . anyway , great chat !"
15494,well have a good one . i gotta go .
15495,"hi there , do you have any interest in space and stars ?"
15496,i think they are fascinating . the sun is probably my favorite star .
15497,so cool . funny to think that when we think of the sun we think of it as being yellow but in fact it is white .
15498,"yes , it has to do with the atmospheric scattering . that's also the reason the sky appears blue ."
15499,that is very interesting . the sun is so hot however the lightning bolt is surface of the sun by 5 times .
15500,wow . that puts new perspective on getting hit by lightening . the sun is a smaller star as well . it's 1 billionth the size of the biggest star in the galaxy .
15501,"yeah , so amazing . since its discovery in 1846 neptune has finnaly been able to complete a full oribt around the sun in 2011"
15502,ho interesting . did you know that the sun is almost a perfect sphere ?
15503,so cool . the sun even accounts for over 99 percent of the total solar system mass
15504,"that makes sense considering that it is 330 , 00 times heavier than the earth ! it produces a lot of energy as well ."
15505,"so true . changing topics , are you a fan of literature and books ?"
15506,yes i am . one of my favorite poets is oscar wilde !
15507,"oh nice . he is amazing for sure . a lot of people like him , like olivia wilde , who changed her last name in his honor ."
15508,"i didn't know about that ! he is very dearly loved , though . his tomb is covered in lipstick !"
15509,"and he had a good sense of humor , once saying to the border agents , i have nothing to declare but my genius ."
15510,haha ! i love that . he was certainly an eccentric guy . he also wrote some great poems about his time in prison .
15511,"speaking of the tomb and the lipstick that you mentioned , if you get caught there is a hefty price to pay ."
15512,"yes i know ! 12 , 000 . i wonder if they have cameras watching it ."
15513,could be . crazy relations between literature and governments sometimes . like when the fda burned six tons of literature during a us censorship .
15514,"there's very true ! or government writing literature , such as when winston churchhill won a nobel prize in literature !"
15515,exactly . it was nice chatting with you .
15516,"hi , do you like to travel"
15517,"i do , especially pub crawls in europe"
15518,"what is pub scrawls , i am curious"
15519,going from pub to pub in london ; you can also get there by double decker bus
15520,"ohh , i see . i love to go from pub to pub one day in my life to enjoy the experience . have you traveled a lot"
15521,"yes , i actually just got back from a dublin literary pub crawl ."
15522,"wow , it is amazing . i am so jealous of your wonderful experience . btw , i am kind of surprised that the sun is white , not light yellow color as we perceive"
15523,how far is earth from the sun ?
15524,i have no idea . but it must be very far because if not our human being has been burned to distinction already because of the sun's extreme heat
15525,i believe the sun's diameter is well over 1 million kilometers in diameter
15526,"i know it is big , but not exactly how big . hahaha . btw , did you know that lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun , approximately 5 times hotter"
15527,"wow , that is amazing . i did not know that but i do know that helium can also be found on the sun"
15528,"yeah , i hear a lot about helium and some of its uses such as to pump it into a ballon . i do not know about other uses of helium gas"
15529,helium was found on the sun before it was found here on earth
15530,"ohh , i see . did you know that the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star in our galaxy"
15531,life on mars at night is amazing at the sunset is blue and not black like here on earth
15532,i wish our earth could have a blue color instead of black because black color makes me depressed . hahaha
15533,is the sun blocking your internet signal tonight ?
15534,"i hope not , if that is the case , my holiday will be ruined . hanaha"
15535,i was worried the sun or smoke had voided the warranty on your computer
15536,enjoy your holiday . bye
15537,tell oscar wilde to keep up the wonderful acting
15538,hey did you know that the sun is actually white ? it's only our atmosphere that makes it yellow
15539,"i did actually , i watch a lot of shows about the universe ."
15540,do you know any cool facts ? like how lightning is 5x hotter than the sun ?
15541,"i didn't know that . but i know that the sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500 , 000 years ."
15542,"ya i wish we could harness that better somehow , that woudl really solve the energy crysis ! also , i miss pluto as a planet haha"
15543,"yeah , it would solve a lot of our world's problems ."
15544,do you read books ? i can't believe the fda burned about 6 tonnes of actual books
15545,interesting . do you know why ?
15546,"i think it was an act of censorship because the books were not factual , but that still seems like an extreme thing to do"
15547,"weird , so they were fiction books ?"
15548,"yes i think so , i'd have to find more information , did you know that romantic kissing is a recent invention ?"
15549,"no , i didn't , but it would surprise me . is that what churchill won a nobel prize for ? kidding !"
15550,"haha ! well i don't think so , it sounds like he won it for peace , but he was also apparently quite a ladies man haha"
15551,"hilarious . there was a contest to come up with the worst possible sentence to a novel , did you know that ?"
15552,"haha no i didn't what was the final sentence , i must know !"
15553,"i don't know either , i just heard about it . pretty funny !"
15554,"haha i was just thinking next time i'm with my girlfriend and she goes for a kiss , i'll tell her i don't believe in kiss , it's a recent invention lol"
15555,hilarious . did you know oscar wilde's were about his wallpaper ?
15556,"haha no i didn't , i never read any of his work did you ? i like his phrase to us customs though : i have nothing to declare except my genius ' haha"
15557,"i read a few of his books . kissing his tomb could result in a 12 , 000 fine !"
15558,wow that's expensive ! i can think of a lot better things to kiss though personally haha
15559,did you know there's a wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities .
15560,thats amazing ! edgar allen poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction .
15561,wow ! julius caesar wrote fan fiction of hercules and oedipus in his youth .
15562,"haha thats funny ! george rr martin despises fan fiction , saying that it is copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers ."
15563,surprising ! in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character .
15564,"that's so dumb . stephen king was terrified as a child when he saw the movie bambi , calling it the first horror movie he saw ."
15565,"wow , from king ? watching horror movies can burn up more than 180 calories ."
15566,"yeah , i just read that , i might need to watch more of them !"
15567,"if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art , you will enjoy the art more"
15568,that's good to know ! the majority of creepy metallic noises in scifi or horror movies are made by an instrument called a waterphone .
15569,"really ? ! ? ! ? danny , the boy from the shining , did not know he was acting in a horror film until several years later ."
15570,lol that must have been disturbing .
15571,probably ! i would be scared . . .
15572,ive heard the noises from walking dead and most zombie noise are just someone eating chicken .
15573,really ? strange ! nasa has a list of accurate space technology terms that writers can use in science fiction stories
15574,starship troopers is the only science fiction novel recommended by three of the five branches of the us military .
15575,term ' robotics ' was accidentally coined by science fiction author isaac asimov in 1941 .
15576,"what does ' coined ' mean ? an ancient greek wrote a sciencefiction story over 1 , 800 years ago , featuring plantbased aliens living on the moon"
15577,created . he created the term . . .
15578,oh interesting !
15579,"an ancient greek wrote a sciencefiction story over 1 , 800 years ago , featuring plantbased aliens living on the moon"
15580,its been great talking to you !
15581,do you like to read horror stories ?
15582,"i don't read that much , do you ?"
15583,"yes i read lots of fiction . but not many horror stories nor science fiction , but they are quite popular , even edgar allen poe wrote a story about cyborg ."
15584,"yeah , i remember he wrote the raven , right ?"
15585,"i think that is him , or at least he is a horror writer . he is a pionner of the genre like bram stocker ."
15586,"yeah , he wrote it . ever see e . t . ?"
15587,"no , i think i am the only one in north america that has not seen it , was it any good ?"
15588,"it is really good , i highly suggest you watch it !"
15589,what genre is it ? is it sciencefiction ?
15590,sci fi and drama i would say .
15591,"do you like sciencefiction movies ? i like the fact that it is almost real , based on logic ."
15592,"i like them some times . i like star trek , or used to . the older star wars were good too . what about you ?"
15593,"i like stories by isaac asimov . and i also like starship troopers , even if it is a little campy ."
15594,"i have a few isaac asimov books . i saw starship troopers , campy it is , but it was a well done movie ."
15595,"the book is also good , it is recommended by 3 of the 5 branches of the military , i don't know if it is a good thing or not ."
15596,"yeah , i'm a bit surprised by that , aren't you ?"
15597,"yes , everyone like to read , i guess soldiers too , they have to occupy the time between assignments ."
15598,that is so true . did you know that ray bradbury wrote spaceship earth ?
15599,"no , i did not , i did not even heard of the title . what it is about ?"
15600,"i'm not entirely sure to be honest . lol ! well , nice chatting with you !"
15601,"you too , i might check that ray bradbury book ."
15602,me too . have a nice day .
15603,are you into horror films ?
15604,hi there . i like them as long as they are not cheesey . i lke mary shelly and bram stoker
15605,lol that is true . mary shelly did frankenstein right ?
15606,yes . i guess that would be classic . although steven king is no slouch to the spooky themes .
15607,"i like his movies , apparently he thought bambi was a horror movie"
15608,yes lol read that . most are predictable to me . like the ones with guys running at you with chain saws . i must like the suspense better and king can certainly do that .
15609,for sure lol . i heard in the shining the boy named danny didn't know it was a horror movie until years later .
15610,they probably didn't want to scare him for life . that was excellent . don't know how many times i've seen it .
15611,"i have only seen it like once but know its famous . that would have scared the kid for sure , good point . i like watching horror movies before going to art galleries"
15612,is it true that you can enjoy art better after doing so ?
15613,"that is what i have heard , i like it a lot when i do that and go , i reccommend it ! are you into fiction at all ?"
15614,i read alot yes . mostly fiction .
15615,"me too , i like science fiction also , robotics was coined by isaac asimov in 1941 , good word now"
15616,not familiar with that author . or maybe don't recognize the name . gonna google him . alien on of my favorites in that catagory .
15617,"i love those alien type movies , which is your favorite ?"
15618,oh my . they're endless . the first was written over 1800 years ago by an ancient greek !
15619,"that is awesome , i did not know that ! i was a big starship troopers fan"
15620,makes you wonder if it was scifi or if aliens did visit us thousands of years ago .
15621,"dang , that is solid , there is a lot of conspiracy around that ! it was nice chatting with you , i am going to look at theories lol"
15622,yes thank you . got my interest sparked here too .
15623,let me know what you find ! have a good day !
15624,do you like movie ?
15625,i love movies ! how about you ?
15626,any genre ?
15627,i like stephen king movies . i see he called bambi the first horror movie he ever saw .
15628,i like the horror genre
15629,watching horror movies can burn up more than 180 calories ! i wonder why i lose weight more when i watch them . lol
15630,"usually a hit or miss , simply depends on the movie"
15631,"ture ! if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art , you will enjoy the art more . so remember that next time before you go to an art museum !"
15632,i think horror films do a good job with the music to set the atmosphere
15633,i agree . the creepy metallic noises that you hear while watching horror movies are made by an instrument called a waterphone .
15634,the waterphone indeed is a unique looking instrument
15635,i've never seen one before . i'll have to look it up . the boy from the shining danny didn't know he was acting in a horror movie until several years later . lol
15636,ya i think the horror genre is very subjective
15637,are you a fan of tom cruise ?
15638,"yes , he is a great actor"
15639,tom cruise spent 2 years learning japanese and swordplay in prepartion for the filming of ' the last samurai ' . what dedication to his craft !
15640,"the plot of the last samurai is cliche , but he pulled it off well in that movie"
15641,"tom cruise once threatened tom kruse , the inventor of the hoveround over the usage of his name . that seems kine of like a petty thing to do ."
15642,"personally while i respect his acting skills , i am not too interested in them as a person . then again , you are right in that it is quite petty"
15643,he's kind of wacky for sure . he spent 10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens . lol
15644,"hey who am i to judge ? he has the money to spend anyway . in any case , thanks for chatting"
15645,you got it ! i enjoyed the chat !
15646,hi how are you ? what do you think of the sun ?
15647,are you talking about the star at the center of our solar system or the magazine ?
15648,"oh , i guess i could talk about both . but lets start with our friend at the center of our solar system ."
15649,"apparently , helium is the only element to have been discovered on the sun , before it was discovered on earth ."
15650,"yes , that is interesting . i guess helium is hard to detect because it is not very reactive ."
15651,i agree with you . i am surprised to know that the sun makes up 99 . 86 percent of the mass of our solar system .
15652,"i figure it was a lot , but it is almost all the mass . the planets are tiny ."
15653,i also found out from a scientific magazine that the sunset on mars is blue .
15654,"yes , the atmosphere is different ! that must be pretty cool . i dont want to live there though ."
15655,i do not want to live there either . apparently there is a radio station that translate solar activity into sound and you can listen live to the sun's music . i wonder what radio station it is .
15656,i wonder what that sounds like . it is calming like the sound of the surf ? or raging like the roar of the wind ?
15657,i do not think it would sound calming .
15658,probably not . it would be better to work on capturing energy from the sun .
15659,do you know that the sun's mass is about 330000 times that of earth ?
15660,"yeah , that makes sense . we are but a tiny speck in the solar system ."
15661,"it is scary . if something bumps into our earth , we are doomed ."
15662,"well , we will need to develop a program that would destroy meteors and stuff . elon musk ?"
15663,we should develop a program . no one has spoken about it though .
15664,"the space force ! didnt trump propose something like this ? who will join the space force ? ? anyway , great chat !"
15665,it was nice talking to you . good night .
15666,have a great weekend !
15667,i want to learn more about the sun and our solar system . thank you for the info i learned a lot from you . good night .
15668,good afternoon ! have you seen any good movies lately ?
15669,"hello there , not ones that are out in the theatre right now but on t . v . i have . are you a tom cruise fan ?"
15670,i am . i'm a fan of his earlier movies . just loved him in top gun and cocktail .
15671,"awesome , i am the same way . give me 80's cruise all day , cocktail is a great movie ."
15672,i am surprised to learn that he spent 10 million on an underground bunker to protect him from aliens .
15673,yeah that sounds pretty crazy to me . did you know he spent two years learning japanese and using samurai swords in prep for that movie the last samurai ?
15674,i did not . i haven't seen that one either . hopefully the 2 years was worth it ! i bet the cinematography was good on that one . they have better and better equipment as the years go on .
15675,yeah i think you are right . cinematography is pretty interesting . did you know roger deakins a cinematographer has been nominated for 13 oscars and never won ?
15676,"that is crazy ! i'm sure he doesn't feel that , ' it is nice to be nominated . ' i'm also surprised a woman has never been nominated for cinematography ."
15677,"yeah isn't that wild , you figure after being nominated so many times he would win . and i am too , i think that will change pretty soon here ."
15678,horror films ? love them or hate them ? ?
15679,i like them . but in my opinion it is pretty hard to make a good horror film . did you know watching horror films can burn a lot of calories ?
15680,"i'm not a huge fan , but watch them on occasion . i can imagine they would burn many calories . my heart is pounding the whole time !"
15681,yeah i can understand why they do too . do you know what most of the metallic noises heard in those films is made by ?
15682,no i don't . what is it made by ?
15683,i guess its an instrument called a waterphone . i am really curious to see what this thing actually looks like .
15684,"i'm not sure , but i bet it is creepy looking . stephan king is a great writer of horror films . what is your favorite ?"
15685,"yeah he sure is , i always liked the original night of the living dead , the one in black on white . i thought it was good . how about you ?"
15686,i really like it or pet cemetery . i like the original it better .
15687,yeah i didn't see the new it that came out recently but the old one is one of the best i agree .
15688,great talking with you !
15689,"same here , i hope you have a good day !"
15690,"hello there , do you watch many horror films ?"
15691,hi how are you ? no i dont but i do like some of them
15692,i am well thank you . i think it is really hard to do a good horror film to be honest .
15693,"yes , people are expecting to be scared they know that something is going to happen . how doyou surprised them ? hard ."
15694,"exactly , plus as soon as it gets a little bit lame , it loses the horror aspect for me ."
15695,"yes , it is hard to maintain the tension . a misstep spoils the illusiion . just like bambi did for me ."
15696,"lol , yeah that is very true . did you know the young actor in the shining , didn't know he was making a horror film ?"
15697,i guess he was naive ? what did he think it was ?
15698,i don't know what kind of movie you think you are acting in when there is a ton of fake blood around ?
15699,i guess he thought it was an adventure ? who knows . maybe he was a slow kid .
15700,do you know what kind of instrument makes all of those metallic sounds in those movies is called ?
15701,"um , i have no idea . is it a special instrument or something ?"
15702,"i guess it is called a waterphone , and yeah i think it is just used in movie effects ."
15703,"a waterphone , like a saxophone ? i guess that is a unique instrument ."
15704,"i am not sure to be honest , i wonder what it does look like ?"
15705,i guess it has water in it ? maybe it just sounds watery . i guess it is useful for film work . do you like tom cruise ?
15706,"yeah i do like tom cruise , but mostly his older movies . do you have a favorite of his ?"
15707,"i like his performance in rainman . he was also good in top gun , born on the 4th of july ."
15708,"yeah that movie was really good , and both of those ones too . i always liked risky business ."
15709,"that was a breakout role for him . great casting , fun story . anyway , great chat there !"
15710,yeah same here it was good talking with you today !
15711,hello ! are you a movie lover ?
15712,"yes , but i like things like ethan hawke playing a tortured protestant priest ."
15713,"first reformed ? i have not seen it , but i hear it is a good film , even if many moviegoers are uncomfortable with the content ."
15714,"i like stuff like that more than say , mission impossible . if you took the action scenes and stunts out of those movies , there wouldn't be much left ."
15715,"yeah . when i was young , action was interesting . as i age , i appreciate the subtle elements more than the typical mission impossible formula of action , stunts , and familiar dialogue . i prefer something with a little depth ."
15716,"the same here . i do think there is a difference between ' critic movies ' and ' audience movies ' . i think with age one looks more for meaning , more like a critic ."
15717,"perhaps . although there is something heroic about seeing an old man like me , tom cruise is in his 50s , who can still run without groaning ."
15718,"lol . yeah , good point . i did like him in risky business back when i could run without groaning ."
15719,"but hollywood looks for sellable movies that can make money , and cruise can deliver in that category most of the time . hollywood is betting on a prequel to mama mia , with predictable refurbishing of abba songs and vampish wriggling to music . and yet , i still want to see that one ."
15720,"yeah , it's funny how things repeat themselves . i'm ok with that but i don't really like anything from the horror genre to return . life's hard enough without horror in my free time . it encourages violence ."
15721,"i guess a good movie is one you don't mind watching more than once . there aren't many horror movies i can say yes to that . besides , watching a horror movie can burn up to 180 calories . who wants that ?"
15722,"yep , i don't know if aliens is considered horror but i've seen it more than once ."
15723,"i remember shivering as i read the original novel , alien . there were some gory scenes . comedy is easier to take . i wish seinfeld was still on the air . seinfeld pocketed over 800 , 000 , 000 , so i guess he can afford to vacation for a decade or two ."
15724,hee yeah . . . loved seinfeld . . . lot's of money for a show that's about trivialities . . . i really like poe when reading . maybe its the cinematography that stresses me to lose all those calories .
15725,"yeah , seinfeld is worth more than tome cruise and tom hanks combined . i guess people will pay more for a comedian than for an actor ."
15726,"seinfeld has a wellrounded cast . i still recall certain things and chuckle to myself , e . g . , the golf ball in the whale , . i don't relive horror movies in a good way like that ."
15727,"true . ' i can't spare a square ! ' and despite all the hilarity , seinfeld never seemed to make really unusual decisions like so many tv stars . like cruise , who spent 10 million to build an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens ."
15728,agree . they kept it on a hilarious steady pace . seinfeld has common sense .
15729,"here is some trivia that defies common sense : did you know that if you watch a horror movie before you go to the art gallery , you will enjoy the art more ? incredible , but true !"
15730,hmmm . not sure about that . maybe for some are but i couldn't see that working for a norman rockwell exhibit .
15731,"maybe it only works for modern art ? hey , nice chatting with you ! stay away from those horror movies now , like the dreaded , ' bambi ' that stephen king once described as the first horror movie he ever saw ."
15732,do you know that the sun is actually white ?
15733,"yeah , something to do with the atmosphere scattering the light or something ."
15734,"when i was a kid , i thought it was yellow ."
15735,yeah me too . apparently a lightning bolt is like 5 times hotter than the surface of the sun . that's hot !
15736,"that is very hot . also , i thought that the sun is as big as the other stars in our galaxy ."
15737,"yeah , its like a billionth the size of the biggest . imagine rotating around that kind of sun ."
15738,"so , it's very tiny . i'm always interested in scientific facts ."
15739,yeah pretty interesting stuff . here's some science for you . the hummingbird steals spiderwebs to build their nests .
15740,i did not know that . they are very naughty !
15741,birds skeletons are mostly hollow and weigh less than the feathers too .
15742,"that was interesting . i did not know that . also , their respiratory and digestive systems are adapted for flight in a unique way ."
15743,didn't know that . i suspect waterfowl have those adapted for swimming then too .
15744,it's very possible . i also heard about unique birds in australia that can make various sounds .
15745,"yeah , they can imitate things like chainsaws . really cool !"
15746,they can also make car alarms and camera sound .
15747,"that's impressive . another weird bird fact , farmers used to walk turkeys to the market in the 18th century in england . they made custom boots for the turkeys to walk in ."
15748,that's very interesting . please tell me more about weird things related to animals .
15749,i don't know if i have any more animal facts off the top of my head but speaking of boots nokia got their start making boots .
15750,i did not know that . i always thought that they made other types of electronics before cell and smart phones .
15751,yeah weird huh . one boot i've always thought was super ugly are ugg boots . you ?
15752,"i know that brand . anyway , i've got to run . nice chatting with you ."
15753,hello ! do you like to listen to music ?
15754,"yes , i love music . did you know there's version of the tarzan soundtrack that are in different languages ?"
15755,"interesting , i wonder how many different languages . i want to listen to the jaws soundtrack though . steven spielberg played the clarinet in it !"
15756,music played with movies has such a resonating effect . i have certain associations with songs because of the way they were played in movies
15757,"yes they really catch you , especially the batman begins soundtrack where every track title is named after a bat !"
15758,it is always fun to learn such things like that . it was also fun to know that the tron legacy soundtrack was negotiated by daft punk as they wore their robot helmets .
15759,that is very interesting ! i wonder where they get their clothes and masks from ?
15760,"maybe they got their clothes and masks from mars ! if not mars , maybe it's moon that people once thought was made by something or someone ."
15761,who would have believed that ! it doesn't seem like it but the highest point of the moon is 1938 meters higher than mt everest .
15762,"i wonder what else is the in the universe . our moon is the fifth largest in the solar system , but who knows how big moons can be in places we've never seen ."
15763,i wonder that too ! i'm glad apollo 11 put an american flag on the moon !
15764,"yeah i agree , an american flag was a good decision . i'd be scared to get moon hay fever if i went on the moon ."
15765,that was a great decision indeed ! i can't believe apple had a clothing line in 1986 !
15766,that would be mindblowing if they started developing smart clothes .
15767,i wonder how much those are worth nowadays ? i'm sure we could find some at the alabama store that sells clothes and cameras from unclaimed luggage .
15768,that store must have such novelties in their inventories !
15769,i'm sure it does ! i wonder if there are any close with moon dust for material ?
15770,the pilgrims didn't often wear black . that makes me question my own wearing of black clothes .
15771,"interesting , we were always taught they did ! i wonder what history actually was like lol ."
15772,i definitely want to see some of apple's clothing lines .
15773,i will have to go look them up on ebay to see what is there ! well have a great day !
15774,hi do you have a favorite item of clothing ?
15775,i love my t shirts and jeans . did you know pilgrims only wear black clothing on special ocassions ?
15776,yeah and otherwise they are in their beautiful and colorful clothing all the time
15777,yeah i like those too . do you know how people in fashion can tell if you need your clothes tailored ?
15778,yes they look for collar gaps in your clothes
15779,yeah that is it . there is a north korean brand of clothing that says made in china
15780,haha oh the irony . apple used to have a clothing line too actually
15781,yes back in 86 but i am not sure what happened to it i do not think it is still around
15782,yes i do not think so either . there is a store in alabama where you can get stuff that was left at airports
15783,"nice , i wonder what they have there . do you know much about the moon ?"
15784,"i know some stuff like , the largest moon of mars is hollow , one third of it"
15785,wow that is neat . a moon of saturn titan is believed to have methane based life
15786,"wow i am not surprised really though , the universes is so vast and there is so much we do not know yet"
15787,exactly . before apollo 11 landed on moon nasa had though about putting un flag ther enot the american one
15788,wow interesting one . the highest point on the moon is 1938 higher than everest
15789,"wow because everest is not high enough , that is just insanely high"
15790,yes exactly . moon dust is apparently harmful to humans
15791,yes it causes a disease called moon hay fever . that sound funny but it is scary
15792,wow and it is so powerful it can actually cut through kevlar like material
15793,"wow , pretty tough indeed . do you know what is the moon's orbital distance ?"
15794,"i do not know that actually , must be a very large number i assume"
15795,"yes it is actually you are right , it is 384 402 km"
15796,wow that is a whole lot fore sure
15797,did you know that humans domesticated horses around 4000 bc ?
15798,i did know that !
15799,how about that horses have only one toe ?
15800,"that's super weird , isn't it ? firefighters used horses before trucks and used the dalmations to calm the horses !"
15801,"interesting . i know of a guy in northeastern oklahoma who is paid by the government to allow wild horses to run on his large ranch . however , they are not really wild , only feral because they are from ancestors who were domesticated ."
15802,i've heard that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads do you think that's really true ?
15803,"no . i have seen the patch , but i have seen many horses being ridden by people and some of those horses did not have the patch . there is one species that is truly wild ."
15804,those fancy lipizzaner horses they use for dressage are apparently born black or brown and take 6 years to turn completely white i guess you wouldn't be able to see a white patch at that point .
15805,good point . the truly wild species is called przewaiski's horse . probably no one wants to domesticate it because they don't want to have to spell it .
15806,"haha ! true ! well , there are like 20 quintillion individual animals on earth , so there are plenty to domesticate with way easier spelling !"
15807,"wow ! i wouldn't even guess that there were that many living cells , much less animals . most consume organic material ."
15808,"i know , right ? that's really interesting . i haven't studied much about zoology , the study of animals , , but there are over 1 . 5 million living animal species that have been described , 1 million of them are bugs ! , , but there are probably over 7 million animal species total ."
15809,god commanded man to subdue the earth . we are compelled by our nature to study everything and much of it has a payoff . scotland has a law that protects the loch ness monster .
15810,"that's hilarious i guess they really thought it might exist , maybe it does ? ? , germany apparently was the first country to give animals constitutionallyguaranteed legal rights , surprisingly ."
15811,"i hope germany did not go too far . i think animals have their place and should not be mistreated , but rights ?"
15812,"it seems like a difficult thing to enforce , and i'd be interested in learning more about the details . does it include all animals , like the 7 million species we were talking about ? , or just like pets and farm animals ? that can't possibly work for meat production . . ."
15813,"true . you can't be charged with a crime for stepping on an ant , for instance . they cannot be that silly ."
15814,"definitely true ! but laws and rules can be outdated or weird sometimes . i'm not sure where it was , but somewhere these two students got suspended for riding their horses to school on 'no vehicles to school day' , not sure what that is exactly , but that seems unfair , right ! ?"
15815,i agree with you . a horse is not a vehicle . they say that hiccups are a holdover from when animals had both gills and lungs . i would like to see the missing links that prove that .
15816,"hiccuping is when your diaphragm gets kinked up or something i thought maybe that was somehow related to gills , who knows ? maybe we did use to be part sea creature and swim in the oceans . hey , that reminds me have you seen that movie cast away ?"
15817,yes . i've never made friends with a soccer ball however . i like tom hanks . nice chatting !
15818,do you like colorful clothing ?
15819,i sure do just like the pilgrims and you ?
15820,yes me too . do you know when they wear black ?
15821,yes that is only for special occasions
15822,yes . do you know how they tell if you need your clothes tailored ?
15823,yes they look for collar gaps in them
15824,yes . there is a store in alabama that sells stuff left at airports
15825,so cool . north korea also has a clothing brand that is called rip curl
15826,yes but in the label it says made in china
15827,yes . apple even had a clothing line in 1986
15828,yes but i think it did not last very much though
15829,yeah . do you listen to soundtracks ?
15830,yes i do . in the movie jaws spielberg played the clarinet
15831,yeah what a talent . have you heard the brother where art thou soundtrack ?
15832,yes and that one was certified platinum 8 times
15833,yeah . did you know phill collins from tarzan speaks many languages ?
15834,yeah and that is why he did the soundtrack in 5 languages for the movie
15835,yeah . do you know where the names of the songs in the batman begins come from ?
15836,yes they are named after different species of bats
15837,yeah . do you know much about the moon ?
15838,i know that the highest point in it is 1983 meters higher than everest . it was really nice chatting today with you
15839,hi !
15840,hi ! happy holidays ! did you know that the greeks made clothing out of asbestos ?
15841,no i did not .
15842,"yes , and it was almost as valuable as gold ."
15843,i really liked the idea of no real distance between the observed and the observer .
15844,"yes , i like that idea . what exactly are you referring to ? where did you find it ?"
15845,the last part of article 1 .
15846,comme des garcons ?
15847,yes .
15848,"yes , lots of good ideas there . i'm glad this kind of project is being done ."
15849,me too . article 2 shows that kawakubo has very unique ideas about fashion .
15850,"yes , i think it's great , playing with our perceptions of bodies and social norms ."
15851,i love what the chains symbolized in article 3 eventhough i feel bad for the model .
15852,yes . i would have liked to see it .
15853,same
15854,did you know that the moon is moving away from the earth at about the same rate as our fingernails grow ?
15855,"no , that's very interesting . can you believe the highest point on the moon is 1938 meters higher than mt . everest ? that's crazy ."
15856,i had no idea . i wonder if we'll ever be able to visit and climb it .
15857,it was very nice talking to you !
15858,you too ! have a great day !
15859,same to you !
15860,do you like liam neeson ?
15861,"oh yes , he's a great actor !"
15862,apparently there is a horse he worked with that remember him for another movie .
15863,very cool ! i love that . animals are so smart !
15864,they say they have evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years .
15865,"yes , he gave the horse apples and had positive emotions ."
15866,apparently icelandic horses have a fifth speed .
15867,"really interesting , negative emotions lead to a grudge holding horse ."
15868,"is that right ? also the fifth speed is ' tolt ' it's basically speed walking , haha !"
15869,oh wow ! love to see that ! westerns were made mostly by men makes sense
15870,yeah now that does . clint eastwood had a midlive allergy to horses . to bad since he played in so many movies with them . i wonder if he just got tired of westerns ?
15871,"i don't know , loved his movies ! i would love to tickle a horse , as long as he didn't kick back ! lol"
15872,"yeah that could definitely hurt you , if not kill you those things are strong ."
15873,"i know they are ! that's sad if an icelandic horse leaves iceland , it can never return . although might be happy to be away from the cold"
15874,i did not know that . dalmatians are associated with fire fighter because they protect the horse and are very calm .
15875,"interesting . i love them too ! hard to believe a shark could be ticklish , wonder where ? lol"
15876,"wouldn't care to find out myself , lol ! there are 20 quintilian individual animals on this planet ."
15877,"crazy number ! ! do you like tom hanks ? i loved cast away , and forrest gump . there is so many !"
15878,yeah i know turner and hooch was on last night .
15879,"really , captain phillips was another good one ! great chat ! !"
15880,"yes , that was one of his best performances to date but your right there are so many . hard to believe he started as a comic . have a good one ."
15881,you too !
15882,are you a fan of tom hanks ?
15883,i guess i am . . . i loved him as the voice of woody in toy story and in forrest gump . lol
15884,me too ! road to perdition was pretty good too .
15885,i havent seen that one . what is that about ? hanks is killing the box office ! 8 . 5 billion worldwide film earning ! ! ! ! ! wow
15886,crazy huge ! he is in a 1920s gangster family . about the only part of the movie i remember is him lol
15887,"lol . . im going to check that movie out . . . omg i forgot about his role in splash , 1984 , . that was my fav movie growing up ! lol"
15888,i didn't see splash . what is it about ?
15889,its a crazy romance movie where tom hanks fall in love with a woman that is a mermaid . lol love it so much i even had my daughter atching splash . ha
15890,cool ! i also saw a league of their own with my parents . watched it again recently on amc or ifc
15891,oh cool what is that one about ?
15892,the first professional womens baseball league . he plays a wellmeaning but drunk and also hilarious manager .
15893,i'm surprised he played a drunk in that movie . . . i'ts been said that he wont take the role of a bad guy .
15894,"he started off a bit sinister , but he was more of a funny drunk than a serious one ."
15895,oh ok . . got it ! are you an animal lover ?
15896,i have two cats but want a dog . how about you ?
15897,atually my daughter has convinced me to get a kitten . we will have her thursday . it will be our first pet . . . . but i had no idea there are 20 quintrillion animals on earth .
15898,more than a few ants in there !
15899,lol
15900,germany provides animals guaranteed legal rights as of 2002 . interesting .
15901,that is interesting . im sure that helps to prevents animal cruelty .
15902,good chatting with you
15903,hi ! do you like horses ? did you know clint eastwood has a mild horse allergy ?
15904,"hello , yes love horses , so beautiful . thats so interesting considering he was in all those western movies lol did you know 95 percent of all modern thoroughbred racehorses can trace their y chromosome to one horse ?"
15905,i didn't that's crazy ! dalmatians are calming to horses so that's why firefighters use to have them all the time .
15906,that is interesting . i find it weird that once an icelandic horse leaves iceland it can never return . that is something i would like to learn more about lol
15907,"ya , i wonder why that is ? i didn't know horses have speeds , but just found out that icelandic horses have a 5th speed which is speedwalking ."
15908,"yeah that interesting too ! i think it is called the tolt . fun fact , the length of horse hair is related to how much sun a horse gets !"
15909,living in the north i'm glad that doesn't determine how much our hair grows . i wonder if the sun affects that lipizzaner horses are born black or brown but turn white in 6 years ?
15910,"thats pretty cool . did you know horses , sharks and orangutans are ticklish ? who tcikled a shark to find that out lol"
15911,no and what did it do . . . laugh ? lol ! did you know hiccups are still around from early evolution when land animals had gills and lungs ?
15912,nice . i wouldnt mind having gills if it meant i could swim for longer lol
15913,me too ! i love swimming . do you believe in the loch ness monster ? it's a protected species in scotland .
15914,"i do believe that it once was alive , but i dont believe it still is . that seems right , i bet they would put it in a museum or zoo of some sort ."
15915,"ya , i wonder why more people don't go into animal studies . . . seems like a stable career choice since there are 20 quintillion individual animals ."
15916,"yeah ! did you know there are lobster and jellyfish that are immortal ? immortal , as long as nothing kills them they can technically live forever ."
15917,i wonder how the ocean isn't overrun with them then ? ! have you noticed how many cats and dogs have white patches on their foreheads ? that's because it happens when they're domesticated .
15918,the ocean isnt over run with them because lobster is delicious lol not only do humans eat lobsters but probably a lot of sea creatures find them delicious too lol i have never noticed that about the patches .
15919,that's a good point ! i'm kind of glad i don't live in germany because they gave animals constitutional rights . . . sorry but i don't agree with that because they can't show agreement .
15920,what kind of rights do they give them ?
15921,"i'm not sure , but any rights is a little weird to me . i'll go see if i can find the answer . nice chatting with you !"
15922,same you too !
15923,have a good night !
15924,did you see oceans 8 ?
15925,no i have not . i have seen ocean's eleven through thirteen
15926,it was pretty cute . it was the all female version of the oceans movie . they robbed the met gala .
15927,is that the movie with sandra bullock and anne hathaway in it ?
15928,"yes . sandra bullock plays danny ocean's , sister . i loved watching the met gala fashions and celebrity cameos ."
15929,did any of the lady's get an oscar for their performances ?
15930,"no , but the met gala is a fun event with crazy fashions like at the oscars ."
15931,"did you know that eminem has more oscars than leonardo decaprio , johnny depp , will smith , george lucas and bill murray combined ?"
15932,"no , but i can believe it . daniel day lewis is actually the only actor to win the best actor oscar three times ."
15933,no way ! thats cool . i think walt disney hold the record for the most though .
15934,"that makes sense . he made a lot of movies ! evidently up until the 90th oscars , they had given out over 3 , 000 since the conception of the award ."
15935,that's a lot of awards ! but i think the awards first aired on tv in 1953 . so i don't understand how they got to the 90th award ceremony . they must have done it on radio prior to tv .
15936,"actually , the academy awards first broadcast in 1930 , then was televised in 1953 ."
15937,that make sense . i've always wondered by they broadcast the awards in more than 200 countries . i didn't even think americans were that popular abroad .
15938,"american cinema is pretty popular , in general . i didn't realize blazing saddles was nominated for 3 oscars , let alone any at all !"
15939,with how political the awards have gotten i am surprised anyone watches them . but they even air them live online . but who wants to watch a bunch of pompous rich people complain about things that they should just keep their mouths shut about .
15940,"i mean , i tend to agree with their politics . what's so wrong about wanting to take care of each other ? a lot of celebrities do nicer things than i do , like dressing up in costume and going to hospitals to visit sick children ."
15941,"they are so full of themselves . . i mean the awards ceremony get nominated for emmys , more awards , . just rich people patting themselves on the back . all at the expense of common people watching their movies ."
15942,"i mean , it's art . we pay for art all of the time . everyone has to earn a living . trump begged to be voted for a nobel prize . awards exist for everything . i don't think it's so terrible to get to wear costumes for a living ."
15943,i dont even watch the cma's anymore because of how political these show have gotten . i have been to la where they held the last ceremony that aired on abc . i was once stationed there when i was in the marine corps .
15944,"yeah , i went to la during the one hosted by jimmy kimmel at the dolby theatre . i think it's important for people with a voice to make change to use whatever platform they can to get a positive message out there ."
15945,hey my friend did you see the movie black panther yet ?
15946,i have and it was by far one of the best comic book movies of 2018 ! ryan coogler did a wonderful job directing it !
15947,ya and chadwick boseman did a great job with the character ! i guess black panther is technically the richest charater in the marvel universe too
15948,doesn't he have a networth of roughly 500 billion ? crazy to think that as most people i'm sure would guess either bruce wayne or tony stark was the richest !
15949,"yup , tony stark ' only ' has 100 billion and bruce wayne has 80 billion too"
15950,"that's crazy ! just think though , boseman couldn't initially afford to attend a summer theater program at oxford until denzel stepped in and funded it privately ."
15951,"that is crazy , its nice too that he thanked denzel 20 years later at the premiere"
15952,so true . so are you also a fan of comic books and superheroes ? i am and would love to one day check out the michigan state university library as it contains the largest public comic book collection in the world !
15953,"i am , i'm from michigan actually and never knew that ! its pretty close to me ill have to check it out"
15954,i'd love to travel up that way and see it as well someday . i'd like to see some of stan lee's dc work as he actually wrote 15 dc comics .
15955,"huh that is interesting , also crazy that dc stands for detective comics , thats good to know"
15956,yeah that's true . wonder if dc released the comic series centered around repairing all the collateral damage caused by super heroes or if that was marvel ?
15957,"ya i don't remember , but which side do you like more marvel or dc ?"
15958,"to be honest , i'm a dc man when it comes to comics but the movies , i'm all marvel studios especially considering they release gems like black panther ."
15959,"oh ya for sure , i like batman the best but besides him i don't like anything dc , did you ever see the garfield spinoff when he became a superhero ?"
15960,ha ! no i didn't but i bet it was hilarious ! i did hear about it though . i know it was entitled pet force . i should check it out one day as i was a huge garfield fan growing up !
15961,"ya check it out ! also funny could be that comic where a guy is normal on a planet of superheroes , his nickname is normalman haha"
15962,"ha ! ha ! that sounds like a very interesting concept being normal in a world of superheroes . wonder how he would fit in with black panther . speaking of which , did you see black panther's debut in civil war ?"
15963,no i didn't what happened ? i do know that marvel's use of the term black panther is not named after the black panther party
15964,i dont want to spoil it but it was great ! it was also boseman's first appearance as black panther .
15965,"ah interesting , and its pretty crazy that the symbols and language they used in the movie were based on real african text and language"
15966,"hello , do you like movies ?"
15967,"sure , how about you ? have you seen the black panther ?"
15968,i have actually i thought it was great . have you seen it ?
15969,i haven't seen it yet ! apparently the black panther has been in comics for over half a century .
15970,yeah it sure has and it is the wealthiest superhero too
15971,i wonder if it's because the movie was different than most modern day movies . it had aspects of the traditional comic book but also drew on african history elements and tribal culture .
15972,yeah that is true . some of those symbols date back to the 4th century
15973,that is cool . i thought that they were made up .
15974,"yeah that is nice that has history to it , real one . chadwick boseman was once admitted into a nice and expensive summer theater camp in the uk but could not afford to go"
15975,"i heard that , and he got funding through a private benefactor who turned out to be denzel washington !"
15976,yeah that is so cool . do you know why marvel censored m'baku's ' praise hanuman ? '
15977,they thought it would be offensive to indian viewers .
15978,"yeah , true . unfortunately it backfired because they thought otherwise"
15979,"yeah , that's really interesting . i hear that there is a lot of lighthearted humor in black panther . i like movies like that . they are fun to watch ."
15980,"that is actually very true . did you know stan lee always ended the calls with , excelsior ?"
15981,no i didn't
15982,the guy was so cool . do you know how marvel trademarked the names superhero and supervillain ?
15983,"i heard they published a generic comic book ! did you know that the dc from dc comics stands for detective comics , so their company name is redundant ?"
15984,actually that is pretty cool . do you know where is the largest library with comic books in the world ?
15985,i am not sure ! where is that ?
15986,"at the university of michigan . nice chat : ,"
15987,do you like colorful clothing ?
15988,i sure do just like the pilgrims . do you know when they wear black ?
15989,yes that is reserved only for special ossaccions
15990,yesh that sure is . do you know what they look for in your clothes to tell if you need the tailored ?
15991,yes they look for collar gaps in them
15992,yeah . did you hear of that store in alabama that sells stuff left at airports ?
15993,yes i bet you they have some pretty unique things in there
15994,yeah . did you know apple also had a clothing line in 1986 ?
15995,yeah i think that is gone now . do you know what panda researchers wear ?
15996,yes they have to wear panda costumes
15997,yeah . did you know sean bean from lord of the rings is afraid of flying ?
15998,so much that he hiked in custome up a hill for filming
15999,yeah . johnny depp travels in his jack sparrow costume to visit kids in hospitals
16000,that is so kind and they are impromptu visits so even better
16001,i know did you know the costume from the labyrinth for hoggle got lost in shipping ?
16002,yes and now is in a museum in atlanta . do you watch the oscars ?
16003,sometimes i do . do you know who won it three time for best actor ?
16004,yes that was daniel day lewis
16005,yes . do you know who has won the most oscars ?
16006,yes that would be walt disney with 22 oscars
16007,"yes , hard to reach for anyone else . nice chat today"
16008,do you like reading about superheroes such as black panther ?
16009,"i do , black panther is one of my favorites , do you like heroes ?"
16010,i sometimes do like browsing through them in comic books .
16011,"there's a lot you miss on the movies , so i like reading the comics , chadwick boseman is a great actor"
16012,"yes , i hear that he plays the main character in black panther ."
16013,"yeah he plays the role of black panther in the movie , did you know that he was the richest superhero out there"
16014,"yes , he apparently is worth 500 billion"
16015,more than stak and bruce wayne combined how crazy is that
16016,"his father must have been very wealthy , he was crowned king after his father's death ."
16017,"i guess he inherited all his money , well he does own a country so that makes sense"
16018,do you think there will be more comic books about him ?
16019,"i think thats a sure fact , so what other heroes do you like ?"
16020,"i don't really know , it's hard to choose from the 300 registered heroes in the us ."
16021,"it is hard , my favorite is batman though , i like marvel comics better but batman is batman"
16022,well then you must know that batman and some others were created by stan lee .
16023,"they were really ? stan lee was a master of comic books , real genius a lot of imagination"
16024,"the michigan state university probably has lots of copies of his work , they have the largest publicly available comic collection in the world"
16025,"wow is that so , sounds like a really complete library , they must have rare comic books in there ."
16026,most of it must be either from marvel or from dc comics .
16027,have you heard of normalman before ?
16028,"i don't know much about him , but i think he was the only one without a superpower on a planet full of superheroes ."
16029,"yeah thats the one , i will have to google more about him , i hope you have a nice night , i think im going to google normalman now"
16030,"ya , you too , nice chatting with you ."
16031,do you have any favorite clothing ?
16032,"yeah , i generally have about three favorite items i wear till they fall apart , and take forever to replace them because i can't find anything new that's exactly the way i want . how about you ?"
16033,me too lol . i get hooked on some clothes and wear them until they wear out . how you heard about apples clothing line in 1986 ?
16034,"no , i never heard of it . my first reaction is hostile , but i'm curious to know what they were like ."
16035,"i agree too lol , i wonder why they haven't brought it back , i think the apple fanatics would be wearing it all the time"
16036,i dunno . if they did something like that in the 80s i'd figure they'd be all over expanding their ' brand ' today . they were a lot less horrible then .
16037,"that is a good point . speaking of clothing , did you know pilgrims actually wore colorful clothing"
16038,"i remember reading that . they also brewed beer . i think a lot of stuff identified with puritanism teetotaling , etc . actually started a lot later with wesleyanism and the second great awakening ."
16039,wow that is awesome lol . i wish they would have taught us this kind of stuff in grade school . nothing like pilgrim costumes in plays
16040,there was a lot that was cool about them .
16041,for sure ! speaking of costumes did you know johnny depp dresses in his jack sparrow costume for sick kids at hospitals
16042,"no , i didn't ! that's cool . it's nice to know he has some redeeming characteristics ."
16043,for sure ! would you ever work as a panda researcher ?
16044,that sounds like a wild job . i bet it would be really uncomfortable in the summer .
16045,"for sure , they get to dress like a panda to work with pandas , i would do it for a year i think lol"
16046,it would be weird being one of the people who tried to encourage the pandas to have sex . apparently that's one of their main jobs .
16047,"yikes , nevermind i take that back ! lol !"
16048,"most jobs taking care of animals have their gross side , unfortunately ."
16049,that is a valid point lol . it was so nice chatting with you !
16050,nice chatting with you too !
16051,"thanks , enjoy your weekend !"
16052,have you seen oceans 8 ? its a great movie
16053,"i haven't seen it yet , i hear it is really good ."
16054,"it is , it has a great cast , the leading actress is sandra bullock , do you ever watch the movies with george clooney ?"
16055,"i have watched a few of his movies , he's a really good actor . he's almost as good as daniel daylewis , he's the only actor to win best actor 3 times at the oscars ."
16056,"daniel daylewis is a great actor i agree , i also like decaprio , weird how eminem has won more oscars than him , jhonny depp and others combined"
16057,"that is pretty crazy , he doesn't have more than walt disney though ! he holds the record for the most oscars won by a man with 22 under his name ."
16058,"wow i guess his talent is feflected on the amount of oscars he has under his name , 22 oscars is a lot"
16059,"yeah it is , did you know that blazing saddles was nominated for 3 oscars ?"
16060,"no not really , did blazing saddles ever win ? i didnt know an award could be nominated for another award"
16061,"i don't think they ever did . i didn't realize that could happen either , but i did hear that the oscars were nominated for 9 emmys in 2013 ."
16062,"yeah 9 emmys , how does that happen ! ! so do you like to wear costumes ?"
16063,"i don't usually like wearing them , i kind of wish i was panda researcher so i could wear a panda costume to work everyday ."
16064,"that costumes can be really hot i guess , i like costumes , for intance the costume of jack sparrow , i heard johnny depp uses it to cheer children in hospitals"
16065,"that's very nice of him . i've seen the hoggle costume before . it was lost in shipping and now resides at the unclaimed baggage museum in scottsboro , alabama ."
16066,"thats amazing , at least it didnt get lost forever , uniforms worn by the alliance on firefly are actually old starship troopers uniforms"
16067,"oh wow , that's pretty neat , i wonder if that helped them save money in the budget ? i heard that sean bean is so scared of flying that he hiked into location in full costume when filming lord of the rings ."
16068,"he did ? he must be really scared to wear that costume all the way up , sean bean is a great actor"
16069,he is a really good actor . did you know that pilgrim clothing was full of color ? they only wore black for special occasions .
16070,"i always though of pilgrims in a black and white way , i guess we took the black and white uniform out of context ,"
16071,"i guess we did too , because that's what i've always thought of as well . did you know that apple had a clothing line in 1986 ?"
16072,"no i didnt , i would buy an apple tshirt , i wonder why they dont have one anymore"
16073,"i'm not sure , it would be cool to have though . i heard that rip curl makes clothes in north korea , but the label says made in china . that's kind of odd ."
16074,"that is odd , there is a store in alabama that sells clothes from unclaimed luggage"
16075,have you watched the black panther ?
16076,"i have seen all the marvel movies multiple times , you ?"
16077,"no , i actually have not seen it yet . i heard that he is actually the richest superhero ."
16078,he is with an estimated 500 billion . i think marvel did a great job with the black panther story line as well as bringing them all together for the avengers .
16079,"yeah , i really should go check it out . i didn't know that he wasn't named after the black panther party"
16080,"too funny , some of the script that you'll see in the movie are factual ."
16081,i heard that the script is based on an actual ancient script called nsibdi .
16082,that's right ! it dates back as far as the 4th century .
16083,have you read black panther in comic book form ?
16084,"if i had it was so long ago i couldn't tell you . i was more of a superman batman fan , haha ."
16085,do you like marvel or dc comics ?
16086,"both but if i have to choose it's marvel hands down , for me . you ?"
16087,i guess i like marvel . did you know that they published a general comic book so that they could trademark the names superhero and supervillain ?
16088,didn't know that . i did hear that the first released comic was in 1933 .
16089,interesting . i guess comic strips had been around in newspapers for longer .
16090,yeah i remember family circle and of course the peanuts but apparently they were the first .
16091,it is surprising to think that my grandparents may have enjoyed comic books . have you heard of the superhero normalman ?
16092,isn't he the one with no superpowers among a people with superpowers ?
16093,that is him . there are over 300 registered superheroes . i don't know who they all are but that's still less than i expected .
16094,how can you be a registered superhero ? that sounds strange to me . men and women firefighters to me are heroes police officers soldiers . . . etc
16095,i think they just meant trademarked superheroes .
16096,"hey , get any sun today ?"
16097,"hello there , not too much it is only about 15 degrees outside today , how about yourself ?"
16098,no it hasn't risen yet . where are you in the world ?
16099,"i am in the united states , and its going to get much colder . did you know that the sun is actually white ? everyone perceives it as yellow though ."
16100,wow i wonder what dogs perceive it as . i just learned that the sun produces enough energy in a second to meet the need of all of planet earth for 500k years
16101,"holy cow , that is an insane amount of energy . i wonder how that is all even calculated ."
16102,i wonder how someone figured that out . here's another one . a lightning bolt is about 5x hotter than the surface of the sun . ouch !
16103,"that is crazy and people get hit by those and somehow survive ! i guess the sun is also 330 , 000 times the size of earth as well ."
16104,"hah seems like a giant , but apparently the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star that has been discovered thus far in our galaxy"
16105,"yeah when you put it that way , it makes you feel even smaller lol . on a different note , do you like horses much ?"
16106,i'm fine with them . i actually saw and petted one yesterday while in a outdoor shopping mall . how about you ?
16107,"that's pretty cool , i haven't been near a horse for years . did you know that dalmatians are thought to calm horses ?"
16108,no i didn't . i bet hildago's favorite movie was 101 dalmations .
16109,"yeah i bet you are right . i also heard that some high school students got suspended when they rode some horses to school on 'no vehicles to school day' , i thought that was pretty lame ."
16110,"that's funny . i would just skip school . speaking of movies though , clint eastwood had a midlife allergy to horses even though he killed 3 men in one of his westerns for laughing at his horse ."
16111,"yeah that is a strange fact , i know he was in plenty of westerns and was around lots of them . and that is crazy !"
16112,"did you hear about the horse that people thought was a genius because he could do math , but really he was just reading the subconscious expressions of his owner to figure the answer ?"
16113,"no i never heard that , like you mean the owner was just tricking everyone ?"
16114,"no , the situation was the horse would be asked a question and then tap his hooves on the ground to communicate . and his owner would just make expressions subconsciously when the correct answer came about and the horse would pick up on it and stop tapping ."
16115,"oh now i understand , thanks . that is pretty funny to say the least . i have an aunt that still shows horses for competitions ."
16116,she should teach it how to do calculus and wink at it whenever it makes the right answer
16117,"yeah geez , that would make some serious money . well it was nice chatting with you today , i hope you have a good day when it comes !"
16118,"hi there , looking forward to chat with you ! ; ,"
16119,hello there ! do you like reading ?
16120,"yes , i love to read , why ?"
16121,do you like non fiction or fiction ?
16122,i prefer fiction . horrors mostly . you ?
16123,i like non fiction when i do read . there's an interesting book by jack london which tells about when he lived as a homeless person in the poorest sections of london . he did this for several months . this helped to expose the gap between the rich and the poor .
16124,interesting . is that a recent position ? i don't remember seeing it in the bookstore . . .
16125,it is a book from 1903 .
16126,"hmm . . . ok . . . not recent then : , lol you like old positions like that ?"
16127,"i like both modern and old non fiction . interestingly enough , country singer jimmy buffet is one of eight people to have both a fiction and nonfiction book get to number one on the new york times best seller list . i wonder what they were about ."
16128,"oh , now that's really cool i have to look up what was the fictional book about . or maybe you know ?"
16129,"no , i am not sure what the fictional book was . apparently george w bush liked ot read non fiction too . he read 186 historical nonfiction books and 14 biographies of lincoln during his presidency ."
16130,"wow . . . sounds like really boring lecture : , for me i mean . . . but i guess it was pretty handy for him : ,"
16131,it's interesting that he liked to read about lincoln . maybe it was more relevant for him since they were both presidents .
16132,"maybe he took some tips from those books ? : ,"
16133,"yes , i wonder if he did . do you like poetry ?"
16134,"i like nick cave's poetry ; ,"
16135,i don't really like poetry . stanley plumly is apparently a great poet who decided to turn to narrative nonfiction .
16136,"interesting . i like dark poetry about people's weaknesses and our demons : ,"
16137,do you write any poetry ? it seems like lots of authors often change their genre as time goes on .
16138,"naah . . . i'm not good at that , but i like listening to singing poetry : ,"
16139,"ah , that sounds like an interesting kind of poetry ."
16140,"have you , by any chance , ever viewed paintings by turner or constable , contemporaries born in 1775 1776 , in museums ?"
16141,"no , but i would be interested to . are they good ?"
16142,yup . now considered great painters . both painted landscapes . do you like that style of art ?
16143,landscapes are my favorite style of paintings . are you familiar with stanley plumly who did nonfiction work of artists ?
16144,"the poet ? yes , a bit . his language skills must have illuminated the lives of both british painters very well . sublimely , maybe ?"
16145,"perhaps , i believe his writings try to show what makes artist's work unique and lasting ."
16146,"yes . i feel for poor , old constable , who couldn't seem to sell paintings in his lifetime . seems to be the story of other artists , like van gogh . . ."
16147,it is nice to read about and try to understand the past . did you george w . bush during his time in the white house read 14 biographies of abraham lincoln .
16148,"that many ? well , there a a lot of lincoln works out there . seem to recall that ' w ' was a historic nonfiction fan , too . how about you ?"
16149,i like reading biographies . i have a read a few about jfk . i think i did this because when i growing i knew adults who were fascinated with him and wondering what the country would have been liked if he wasn't assassinated .
16150,"i get it . don't honestly know of a really distinctive jfk biography , but i've got his book , profiles of courage , a nonfiction account of brave individuals i can really recommend . jfk could write well !"
16151,"yes , i read that many years ago . did he write that while recovering from his world war ii injuries ?"
16152,"right , though he never really recovered . nonfiction writers take responsibility for truth in the events or people or info . they present . contrast jfk's sublime ability to do that , with our current president's daily lies and misinformation . . . writers may make better leaders ? ? ?"
16153,perhaps . i think our current president should become a fiction writer .
16154,"well said . maybe ' the art of the deal ' is just that : fiction . are you familiar with the writer , ellen g . white ?"
16155,is she the author who translates nonfiction ?
16156,"actually , i she she is the female nonfiction author who's the most translated into other languages ."
16157,that is interesting . here's one you might know : jimmy buffet is only of one of eight people to have both a fiction and nonfiction book reach number 1 on the new york times best seller list
16158,"who would have guessed ? just goes to show that the nyt best seller list doesn't always mean best written ! i guess nothing beats the bible for sales and impact , though . great to talk with you . blessings ."
16159,its been good talking to you . sure you don't want to talk just a bit more ?
16160,"thanks . another time , perhaps . just have to finish a book this weekend ! cheers ! !"
16161,"okay , hope to talk to you again"
16162,regards .
16163,"hi , do you know much about the sun ?"
16164,"hey there , i know some stuff , like that it is white and not yellow ."
16165,yeah atmospheric scattering must be really good at playing tricks like that on us .
16166,haha yeah that is true . it makes up almost 100 percent of the mass of the solar system
16167,wow that is amazing . and it is so hot that we only need one second of its energy for 500 000 years
16168,wow that is very little for a lot in return . sunsets on mars are blue
16169,"ohh i would like to see that . a lightning bolt is much hotter than the sun , 5 times to be exact"
16170,that is a lot of energy packed in there . did you know the sun does not rotate as a body ?
16171,hmmm so how does that work ?
16172,well the poles rotate slower than the equator .
16173,ohh that is pretty cool . the sun is still on bilionth of the biggest star in the galaxy
16174,wow that really puts things into perspective . do you by any chance like animals ?
16175,i do . i have a cat and two dogs . how about you ?
16176,i have a dog only but i also like horses . when they leave iceland they are not allowed to return there
16177,wow i wonder why . do you know why dalmatians are associated with firefighters ?
16178,hmm to be honest i ave no idea . but speaking of horses . their hair lengths is related to the amount of sun they get
16179,that is pretty cool and dalmatians are because they can calm down horses and protect them
16180,wow what a bond they must have then . did you know horses are ticklish ?
16181,what ? haha that is so funny did not realize they are . clint eastwood who is always on movies with horses is apparently kind of allergic to them
16182,"wow that is ironic . yeah and it is not just horses that are ticklish , sharks and orangutans as well"
16183,"wow that is so amazing , i had no idea"
16184,"hi , how are you ? do you like fantasy and fiction ?"
16185,i do ! i hope to read a really interesting sounding book by bacigalupi and buckell called ' the tangled lands . ' have you heard of it ?
16186,"no , i have not . what is it about ?"
16187,"it's got to do with living in a fantasy world where there is magic , but it is forbidden . the reason for the magic ban is pretty interesting , too ."
16188,"magic exists but is banned ? interesting . and if you are caught using magic , what happens ?"
16189,"well , according to what i've read , this fantasy world will grow vines that choke out everything and will put you to sleep if you touch them ."
16190,"hm , well that's no good . i guess i should refrain from using magic . nobody uses it then ? that's a shame ."
16191,there's a kind of scientist in the storyline that tries to combat the bramble vines . i wonder if he is ever successful ?
16192,a scientist ? interesting . any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic .
16193,"the book also has some type of mad spirit , too . i wonder how the scientist would explain it and if he tries to stop it like the vines ?"
16194,"well , i guess the only way to find out is to read the book ! lol what other fiction do you like ?"
16195,i read all of the black stallion fiction books as a kid . i had a lot of books i liked but really can't remember them all ! which fiction books do you like ?
16196,"wow , that goes back a long way . i haven'tread those books in years . i don't read much fiction . ususally non fiction . i enjoyed sci fi and fantasy . lotr ."
16197,"i still haven't read the lotr books , unfortunately . i was waiting to get some type of special collector edition from a local bookstore that sells lots of classic fiction books . i love the movies , too . great fantasy !"
16198,"yes , the best , really . so many imitators . what about neil gaiman ? he's good too ."
16199,"i haven't , but i am interested to read his stuff . have you read any fictions by james michener ? i loved the book he wrote about hawaii !"
16200,"oh , he wrote a ton of books about different countries and cultures . no i haven't . i guess i should . what's his best ?"
16201,"definitely the one about hawaii ! it's happy , sad , inspirational , satisfying , etc . . . did you know there are a bunch of fiction books based on jim henson's ' the dark crystal ? '"
16202,didn't know that . is that for kids ?
16203,"yes , when i was a kid i remember watching the movie with little puppets . it's sort of scary . i guess henson said he believed it wasn't healthy for children to never be frightened . you never saw it ?"
16204,"i might have , i don't remember . he's right . fear is normal . all emotions exist to help us understand ourselves and the world ."
16205,"it definitely scared me . so did a skit on sesame street , though ! what a fantasy world sesame street is , right ? ! have you heard of the place you can study fiction and fantasy lit ?"
16206,"there are probably programs in small colleges where you could . that is probably perfect for some students . anyway , great chat !"
16207,you should look up that fantasy fiction lit university . you can even concentrate on tolkien studies there !
16208,what do you think about scientists ?
16209,"i think scientists are very interesting . we need more of them , did you know that there is a rocket scientist that is a coach for the nfl by the way"
16210,"i didn't know that , who is it ?"
16211,his name is matt patricia and he's an aeronautical engineer
16212,interesting . is he any good ?
16213,"i'm not sure actually , but he is smart so he is probably good lol . what do you think about the fact that it is illegal to own a rabbit in queensland unless you are either a scientist or magician"
16214,"that is weird , do you happen to know why that is ? seems sort of odd , right ?"
16215,"not sure , i guess they're just very strict with their rabbits lol . what do you like about fantasy stuff by the way ? have you ever done fantasy football"
16216,"i'm not huge into fantasy stuff , i've never done fantasy football . i don't have enough free time for that , what about you ? ."
16217,"yeah i don't play fantasy sports , but i do watch fantasy movies like the lord of the rings , the lord of the rings return of the king actually won best picture at the academy awards"
16218,"i saw a few of those , i don't think i saw the last one of the series , was it any good ?"
16219,"yep that was the last one that won the award , i actually like the first one the best but they are all pretty good"
16220,"what about game of thrones , do you watch that ? the acting is really good ."
16221,"yeah i do like game of throne i can't wait for the new season to come out in april , what about you"
16222,"i've only seen up to season 3 , but i think dinklage and the kid that played joffery were great at their jobs ."
16223,"yep i agree with you . i also like the books that game of thrones is based on , they are works of fiction , do you read at all"
16224,"i do , but i tend to read fiction for some reason . right now i'm reading hunter s . ' hell's angels ."
16225,i heard that's a good book . did you hear about the judge in the fifties tried to ban a comic book because there was a black character in it
16226,"no , what judge was it ?"
16227,"i don't know his name but it was in the 50s , luckily i think that time has passed"
16228,"well , nice chatting with you ."
16229,did you watch black panther ?
16230,"no , it is on my watch list . tell me about it . is this a genuine marvel film or a ripoff ?"
16231,"i liked it , i think you should watch it , it set a record as it eard 235 million in just 4 days ."
16232,cool . is this the film starring chadwick boseman i saw advertised ?
16233,"yeah chadwick boseman is one of the leading actors , he is 41 years old but looks a lot younger ."
16234,"probably a vegan like tom brady . meat ages a person faster , although living without meat makes mealtime drag , so maybe it is an illusion . in any event , glad boseman made the cut . he played the role in captain america : civil war . i hate it when actors swap characters ."
16235,"i know i wouldnt to be able to live without meat lol , i just love it too much , and he did ? what role did he play in captain america ? he was black panther in that film as well right ?"
16236,"yup . it's nice to see a marvel film with a predominantly black cast . a great actor can play any role , but you can't fake skin color . no need to when there are so many good actors of every color or race ."
16237,"i agree with you and also danai uirira and lupita nyongo , they also had a great performance in the movie"
16238,"nice . i may have to watch it on netflix today . you know the script for the movie is based on a nigerian script dating back to the 4th century ? not that i'm that old , but i appreciate continuity !"
16239,"i didnt know that ! that is an interesting fact and you should watch it for sure , black panther is a movie thats celebrated as a shift for a more positive thinking attitude in africa , its a movie thats making history so you wouldnt want to miss that ."
16240,"yeah , maybe i'll invite some frinds over to watch and we'll have a black panther party . of course , it will have nothing to do with the political group , just like the movie is unrelated to the political group . i could rename it a black leopard party , but it does not have the same poetic ring to it ."
16241,"and people wont understand if you call it like that lol , you know black panther is considered the richest hero , more than stark and batman combined , thats crazy !"
16242,"poor tony stark . i feel for the poor rich guy . . . not . hey , did you know denzel washington had a hand in chadwick boseman's rise to fame ?"
16243,"i didnt know that , how did denzel contribute to his rise to fame ?"
16244,"as i understand it , denzel paid for chadwick to attend a prestigious summer theater program in oxford 20 years ago . denzel is a class act ! if you have not seen his youtube inspirational speaches , you should check them out ! so , 20 years later , chadwick gets to thank denzel for it during the premiere ! awesome story !"
16245,"that is a great thing to do , chadwick is going to be in his debt forever , you know that marvel created a hero for a kid that had to wear hearing aids but felt bad about it , its called blue ear ."
16246,"news to me ! if it gets made into a film , i hope it does not flop at the box office like disney's treasure planet !"
16247,"i think it could be a successful movie , i bet that kid will watch it for sure so thats one viewer , sony had the chance to buy the cinematic rights to almost every marvel hero but only bought the rights of spiderman"
16248,"studios are known to be risk adverse . they have been burned too many times . like the movie , trojan wars , that shelled out 15 mil for production and earned only 309 at the box office . how does that happen ? i could make more with a showing in my garage . . ."
16249,maybe it didnt have a good adverticement and was a terrible movie with a lame plot .
16250,black panther is an american superhero film based marvel comics character .
16251,yes . the disney smash hit grossed over 192 million over the weekend !
16252,"black panther has ascended so fast at the box office . it has the biggest opening ever for a standalone film , it created a biggest box of office in opening show day history all over the world ."
16253,it was and it is the 18th film in the marvel universe !
16254,"the film received many awards and nominations , 91st academy awards including best picture ."
16255,"only 4 other movies had bigger opening debuts star wars : the force awakens , star wars : the last jedi , jurassic world , and the avengers ."
16256,it is the highest grossing film in america and canada and second highest grossing film 2018 in the world wide . it shows the director and actor hard works .
16257,yes . the richest superhero is the black panther .
16258,"yes , tony stark and bruce wayne is also the richest actor ."
16259,yes ! the symbols and written script featured in black panther are based on an actual script called nsibdi .
16260,"marvel comics is the brand name and primary in publication of the comics book . later then , they are moved to movies also ."
16261,yes ! i had some of the marvel comics when i was a kid . black panther was almost changed to black leopard in order to avoid confusion with the controversial group .
16262,"marvel comics created superhero , blue ear , just for a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing hearing aids it really very amazing ."
16263,that is amazing ! the silence of the lambs came out on valentines day in 1991 and had a box office of over 270 million !
16264,why is your favourite superhero character ?
16265,"if i had to pick one , i would pick iron man . did you know that disney's treasure planet was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time ?"
16266,yeah . disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure .
16267,i can't believe that they would consider shutting that down . do you like tom hanks ?
16268,yes . he is the highest all time box office star .
16269,yes ! his movies have made over 8 . 5 billion dollars at the box office ! i had fun chatting with you !
16270,very nice chatting with you . have a great day .
16271,you have a great day too
16272,do you like marvel movies ?
16273,i am not really a fan of those movies but i am familiar and have read a lot of information about them
16274,black panther grossed over 200 million in the first four days of its release .
16275,wow that is a lot for the first days of release
16276,you should really try to watch it . i think that all marvel movies are awesome ! do you know who the main characters are ?
16277,"i am familiar with the lead , black panther character , but i havent gone in depth with them . speaking of characters did you know there is one character owned by both marvel and dc , named access , whose sole purpose is to try to keep both companies' universes separate ."
16278,i didnt know that . i was however surprised when disney bought marvel .
16279,"i am not surprised . its a big money maker , disney does not own the rights to show ' big ' marvel characters , avengers , xmen , spiderman , etc , in theme parks east of the mississippi , due to a contract marvel signed with universal studios in the 90s"
16280,"that's right the walt disney company only acquired marvel entertainment , marvel worldwide's parent company . marvel started in 1939 as timely publications , and by the early 1950s , had generally become known as atlas comics ."
16281,"in 1998 , marvel offered the cinematic rights of almost all of its characters to sony for a mere 25 million . sony rejected the offer , and only purchased the rights to spiderman for 10 million believing that movie audiences would only care about him . . . imagine missing the opportunity to buy the rights or so cheap"
16282,i know they are really kicking themselves about that . many people are using the movie to celebrate a shift towards a more positive empowering potrayal of people from africa
16283,"yep . did you know that the writtings and symbols in black panther werent just made up , the are based on a script called nsibdi , going back to the 4th century from present day nigeria"
16284,yeah symbolism is everywhere . personally i think the villain played by michael b anthony stole the show . his name in the film was killmonger .
16285,i have heard a lot of people say that exact same thing . maybe i should watch the movie to see for myself
16286,"you want be disappointed . did you know that the black panther is the richest super hero , worth 500 billion ."
16287,i did know that . that is more money than tony stark and bruce wayne
16288,i think its pretty funny that they had to go to court arguing that mutants are not human .
16289,yeah . . but in the end it they got a cheaper price on items since it is a toy and not human
16290,yeah i guess thats the bottom line .
16291,"yes . these industries live by the same rule wutang clan does , c . r . e . a . m . cash rules everything around me"
16292,"indeed ! i did think it was sentimental that they created a superhero with a hearing impairment . his name was blue ear , have you heard of him ?"
16293,i read something about him . was made to help a kid who didn't like the idea of hearing aids
16294,did you know marvel got to play a lower rate on toys because they said mutants aren't people ?
16295,i did not know that ! are you a comics fan ? did you know that black panther is one of the top grossing movies ever ?
16296,i heard that it was ! have you seen it ? i haven't even watched it yet .
16297,i have not . i have seen a couple of the comic movies . this one set records for having a huge opening by a black director .
16298,"the black panther is supposedly worth 500 billion . that's more than apple , i think !"
16299,i wonder where he got his money ? i did read that his name black panther has nothing to do with the black panthers from the '60s .
16300,"i saw that it is from something calld nisibdi , which goes back to the 4th century in nigeria . it's more likely the party was named after him ."
16301,did you know that marvel comics sold the screen rights of its characters for 25 million to sony ? sony turned them down and offered 10 million only for spiderman ? they thought that was the only character people would be interested in .
16302,do you think it's because sony only wanted to create video games from the movies ? i have to admit that i like the spider man movies the most . the whole ai situation with ironman i find a little creepy .
16303,i did enjoy spiderman but some of the avengers are getting difficult to keep up with ! i can't believe that disney owns the rights to produce the movies but can't use it in there parks . i know universal theme park has the spiderman ride .
16304,"wow ! i didn't know universal had a spiderman ride . i knew that disney owned the star wars franchise , now , but marvel ."
16305,"on another note , did you know that tom hanks is the highest all time box office star ?"
16306,i think i heard that he was . what movie did he make the most money on ?
16307,"i am not sure , but i would guess it was the action one about the vatican scandal . can you believe that silence of the lamb came out on valentines day ?"
16308,no . i didn't remember when the movie came out . i know that i was in college because i wanted to be a prosecutor until i saw that movie .
16309,yikes ! disney's biggest flop was treasure planet . i have never heard of it !
16310,"i have heard of it , but i always get it confused with the muppets treasure island ."
16311,haha ! i do remember hearing that denzel washington had supported an actor through college . i read that it was chadwick boseman who got to thank him as the black panther premiere .
16312,"that was super nice of denzel washington . of course to denzel , that money was probably pocket change . now , chadwick boseman will have enough money to support someone else after playing the black panther ."
16313,i like the truly kindness in people . did you know that the superhero creators made blue ear to make a boy feel better about wearing hearing aids ?
16314,"no , i didn't , but i love that idea ! hope you have a good night !"
16315,hi . do you like science fiction
16316,"i do enjoy science fiction quite a bit , as well as all sorts of fiction . it certainly says something that lord of the rings won the only academy award for best picture for a fantasy film ."
16317,"by the way , do you want to be a scientist"
16318,"no , i think that science is interesting but not something i want to study with my life's energy . i do find it shocking to hear that we have reached the point of storing gif images onto the dna of bacteria !"
16319,"did you know that akihito , the emperor of japan is a scientist"
16320,"no , that's amazing ! i love to learn about people in various roles who are secretly scientists , such as matt patricia who is a coach for the nfl but also a rocket scientist ."
16321,he does not look like a scientist to me
16322,the coach or the japanese emperor ? i think it's important to note that being a scientist does not automatically make someone ' bright . '
16323,i concur . being knowlegable in one thing does not guarantee in the others
16324,"exactly , although it does seem like older scientists such as william whewell from 1833 , were more fancy and legitimate than some of the people today ."
16325,did you know harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon
16326,"no , i had never heard of him only the classics like armstrong and aldrin ! it's no wonder though since the scientists are the ones who do all of the hard work . in fact much of our culture and modern knowledge stems from the early form of science which was called natural philosophy ."
16327,i thought that there should be a lot more of them walking on the moon already
16328,"i guess it gets complicated when science is so wrapped up in every industry such as government , academie , nonprofits and most importantly the economy . they must not be able to afford it ."
16329,i was surprised that the world wide web was invented in 1989 . i thought it was way before that
16330,it is a bit nerve inducing though when you think about the plots of shows like ' black mirror '
16331,i have never watched that show . what was it about
16332,it is an anthology series that features various horror plots about the modern technology and other things like that .
16333,"ohh , i see . i am going to watch it if i have time"
16334,"i haven't watched it much though yet , i find all of this technol so creepy especially the storing data in dna bit !"
16335,happy holiday
16336,you too
16337,bye
16338,do you like watching the marvel comic movies ?
16339,i do ! they are some of my favorites how about you ?
16340,"i love them , black panther was one of my favorites . so much awesomeness in that film , did you like it ?"
16341,"i loved it ! i didn't realize though that the character wasn't actually named after the black panther party . i always thought it might be connected , but apparently the super hero predates the party ."
16342,"me too , i did not know that either , it would make sense because of the black part . he is also the richest superhero at 500 billion dollars"
16343,i read that too ! that's crazy . did you know disney doesn't own any rights to use big marvel characters east of the mississippi ? i've always wondered why they never had any marvel things at disneyland i guess thats why !
16344,"that is interesting ! i did not know that , i have only been to florida . who is your favorite marvel character ?"
16345,"spiderman for sure ! did you know that sony got offered the rights to all marvel characters in 1998 , but rejected it and purchased spiderman only because they didn't think people would care about the others ?"
16346,"nice i love me some spiderman ! i heard stan lee created iron man because he didn't think anyone would like them . speaking of disney before , did you hear about their biggest box office flop ?"
16347,"really ? its hard to imagine anyone not liking iron man . and no , i didn't hear what was it ?"
16348,"it was treasure planet , they spent 15000000 on it and made only 309 dollars ! i can't believe that to be true !"
16349,oh my gosh i've never even heard of that ! 309 is nothing !
16350,right ! i want to watch it to see how bad it really was . i wonder if they pulled it out of embarrassment and many people being fired
16351,for real ! i want to see it too ! did you know sleeping beauty was a box office failure too ?
16352,"i did not know that , i did hear one movie made disney almost shut down their animation studios , must have been that"
16353,yeah that was it ! crazy to think disney animation could have ended that soon so many good movies would never have been made !
16354,"for sure , i love frozen and moana . frozen was the first movie directed by a woman for disney"
16355,i love both of those too ! i didn't know frozen was directed by a female really cool ! was moana as well ?
16356,"i am not sure , but it was a box office hit ! good chatting with you !"
16357,good chatting with you as well !
16358,bye !
16359,"hi , how are you ?"
16360,"pretty good thanks for asking , you ?"
16361,i'm groovy . did you know that the emperor of japan is a scientist ? i guess he has time among his other official duties .
16362,yeah i heard he still to this day publishes papers
16363,"sometimes i wonder what these scientists are getting up to . harvard scientists stored a gif animation of a galloping horse in the dna of bacteria . um , what about a cure for cancer ?"
16364,no money in that ! ! i feel the same way . the term scientist didnt even become of regular use until the 19th century .
16365,"the web was invented pretty recently , in 1989 , by a scientist working in switzerland for the cern . tim berners lee . the guy is a legend , but probably brought human productivity iin the work place to a standstill ."
16366,wow i did not know that . however was it funded by a europeanstate ?
16367,"yeah , cern is in europe . it's a big research facility . did you know that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character ? i can't imagine that happening in europe ."
16368,yeah unfortunately some ppl are mean and hateful . did you know that fantasy congress is a real thing
16369,"people will wager on anything . it's good to take an interest in politics but i don't think those people that do fantasy congress care about realworld implications , just whether they win ."
16370,yeah your right ! julius caesar wrote fantasy .
16371,"he had an active imagination , which probably helped him as a general ."
16372,probably ! did you know that edgar allen poe wrote the first known example of what we would call a cyborg .
16373,the guy was certainly macabre . great imagination . but married a 13 yo if i recall correctly .
16374,yeah he was clearly interesting
16375,but left an entertaining legacy for us ! i agree with george rr martin about fan fiction . it's usually awful .
16376,harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon
16377,i guess you need to be in great shape to go to the moon . soon there will be commercial travel to the moon and every old lady with a dog will be going .
16378,funny ! but if old newt gingrich gets hes way will have a colony there soon .
16379,"well , i enjoyed chatting !"
16380,did you know that there is a fantasy draft for the national spelling bee ?
16381,that is crazy ! i wonder how it works ?
16382,"me too . you know there was a janitor in chicago that wrote 15 , 145 pages over 6 years . wow !"
16383,that is crazy . it is unfortunate that is was discovered after his death . it would have been nice if he was alive .
16384,yes one can hope right ! it was a fantasy manuscript with over 300 watercolor illustrations . do you remember what it was called ?
16385,it was called ' in the realms of the unreal ' . creative name .
16386,yeah real catchy title right . makes me want to open it up . apparently there was a guy that got knighted for his service to literature . you know him ?
16387,was it the comedic fantasy author terry pratchett ?
16388,it was good for him i wonder what it's like to be knighted ? did you know a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy ?
16389,that is crazy ! i would think it would be more than just a fold !
16390,"yeah me too , lets us know how close we are to insanity . lol ! do you like fiction ?"
16391,some fiction . have you ever used wiki to see the ranks for fictional characters ?
16392,i did not know they even did that i'll have to check it out . what do they rank them by i wonder .
16393,they rank according to their powers and abilities .
16394,"oh ok that makes sense , lol . did you know that caesar wrote fan fiction ?"
16395,he wrote fan fiction about hercules and oedipus in his youth !
16396,yeah that sounds cool . you know edgar allen poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction ?
16397,i did not know that ! the ravens football team is after his works .
16398,to funny ! fiction refers to any narrative that is derived from the imagination .
16399,"further , it is not based strictly on history or fact ."
16400,and can also refer more narrowly to narratives written only in prose .
16401,i might go to the library and find some fiction books . have a nice day .
16402,i thought the black panther movie was generic and not that good
16403,i respect that opinion . i personally thought the movie was very well made and introduced many interesting characters . earning 235 million at the box office is quite a feat .
16404,"that is impressive , i think this whole thing about the strong feminist characters is very overblown , i thought females portrayed in movies like terminator 2 and aliens are more realistic , they are women that are bad ass but in a realistic way"
16405,i did enjoy both terminator 2 and the aliens movies . i think that we need to have women who are bad ass in all areas . adding in a general and spy to those ranks is good for women . what did you think of the idea of having an all female protection squad like the dora milaje ?
16406,"ya i mean that is fine . it says in this article that their sex appeal is obvious but secondary to their personality and skill . they didn't have a personality in my opinion , i guess they had skill but i find it very unrealistic that they are killing people who have guns with like swords and spears"
16407,i think that requires a suspension of belief which it sounds like didn't quite cross the gap for you . the comics go much more into detail of why wakanda's weapons are swords and spears as you put it but that is quite a bit for a movie to explain until ripley's weapons in the aliens movies or terminator weapons . even though i did enjoy the movie i didn't think it was more than a weekend activity .
16408,"well i appreciate your honestly and i'm not judging you for your opinion , i'm reading through and it says that black panther is actually the richest marvel superhero , even more than tony stark , which i didn't know"
16409,"that is true , although to be frank that's like comparing spiderman , tony stark , to batman , black panther , which is not really fair . tony developed all his own technology and black panther had a lot of help and inherited his wealth though his country . i did like that dorothy steel was able to make her acting debut as the old woman in black panther . sometimes people get a dream late ."
16410,"ya that is nice , and he would be richer than even tom hank's entire box office draw at 8 . 5 million , which is a ton , also that is so weird that silence of the lambs came out on valentines day"
16411,"what a creepy valentine's day debut ! yeah , tony stark is my favorite avenger as i like seeing how far his character has come to far . i hope he mentors black panther and the rest of the avengers but that avengers : endgame doesn't look like he will get the chance . i wonder if marvel will ever show the blue ear superhero in the avengers ."
16412,"ah i haven't heard of the blue ear , i do think its funny that marvel tried to sell sony all their properties in 98 but they refused , and now marvel is making so much money as sony's superhero movies are pretty terrible , in my opinion"
16413,"yeah , blue ear was a character created for a 4year old child who was uncomfortable wearing hearing aids . i did not know marvel tried to sell to sony . that's so funny when you think about it now . did you know michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics in the 1990s ?"
16414,"nope i didn't know that either , i wonder how much he offered , i know they were in bad shape for some part of the 90's , it's good that they're back on track now"
16415,"yeah , it is good they are back on track . if we look back though you can find may movies in the past did very well . look at the original star wars movies which if we adjusted for inflation would have made 1 . 3 billion at the box office ."
16416,"ya that is crazy , it's also wild that walt disney owns marvel and the star wars movies , they really have exploded and its funny they were thinking about closing their doors when sleeping beauty was a box office failure"
16417,it is wild that walt disney has acquired all these properties . not only sleeping beauty was a box office failure but other movies like john carter and children of men which when we look back in time both were considered failure but children of men lost 8 million at the box office .
16418,"oh wow i didn't know children of men only made that much , i actually like that movie a lot , i did remember disney's treasure planet movie , that was a huge bomb , i saw it recently its ok but i can see why it wasn't successful"
16419,"yeah , it's sad that children of men lost that much money but ironic that mortal kombat 2 was the first video game to make more than hollywood box office sales before call of duty . however there are more losses which were actually wins as well like lord of the rings which had major losses despite being a huge box office success ."
16420,"ya that is surprising , have you seen the movie trojan wars ? budget of 15 million and made only 309 ? thats hilarious i'm gonna look it up now"
16421,i have not seen trojan wars but i will check it out sometime . thanks for chat and remember you can't loss more money than marvel or the fantastic four movies .
16422,haha thanks nice talking with you
16423,have you seen black panther film ?
16424,i did . i saw it was just nominated for several oscars including best picture . did you know that he is the richest superhero ?
16425,"yes , i know a little bit . i think 'black panther' stars share reallife inspirations ."
16426,"i was not aware of that . that makes for nice relationships on set . black panther the character is estimated to be worth 500 billion . to compare , tony stark has 100 billion ."
16427,do you like chadwick boseman ?
16428,black panther is the only movie i've ever seen him in . he did a good job in that movie .
16429,he is known for his portrayal of t'challa .
16430,yes that is the only role i've ever seen him in . danair gurira was in it and i had seen her in the walking dead so she was the one i was most familiar with .
16431,have you know the details of box office ?
16432,i know some facts about box office returns . like tom hanks is the highest box office star .
16433,"yes , he is an american actor and filmmaker . hanks is known for his comedic and dramatic roles in such films as splash , big , turner and hooch"
16434,yes he has had lots of hits . later he had movies like saving private ryan which is amazing . did you know that sleeping beauty was a box office failure ? that surprises me but it's not always the best indication of success because i know several bombs that became hits later .
16435,"i think , walt saw the potential to sell guests at his groundbreaking theme park on his upcoming film and renamed it sleeping beauty castle before its grand opening ."
16436,he certainly made a good business decision there . i can't believe that they opened the silence of the lambs on valentine's day ! it worked out for them though because they made 270 in box office returns .
16437,"yes , disney also has some of the biggest box office flops of all time ."
16438,"that's very surprising to me . they seem to be doing just fine though . speaking of since disney just acquired marvel , do you enjoy marvel ?"
16439,"yes , i like it . marvel comics group , a publisher of american comic books and related media ."
16440,i like a lot of their properties and movies . i did not know that there is a character named access that is owned by both marvel and dc . they are such strong competitors that it surprises me .
16441,me also like their movies . that's interesting .
16442,but marvel is a savvy business so i'm sure it benefited them somehow . did you know that they had to pay less for their toys because dolls are more expensive and they won an argument in court by saying that xmen are mutants and not people so they can't be dolls ?
16443,sorry i do not know about this . do you know that details ?
16444,basically they argued in court that xmen characters were mutants and not people so they paid less to distribute the toys because they were then classified as toys instead of dolls and dolls cost more .
16445,did you happen to see the black panther movie ?
16446,"yes , i rented the movie from my cable company ."
16447,"i did not see it yet , but i want to eventually ."
16448,you definitely should ! it did very well and was well received by most people .
16449,"i heard it had the 5th biggest opening ever , that is very impressive ."
16450,i agree . i love the avengers series . i try to see as many of them as i can . do you enjoy them as well ?
16451,i haven't seen any of the avengers movies actually . i did read that avengers ; age of ultron had a huge box office total as well .
16452,"yes , but i'm not sure of the future of the series since disney bought the company ."
16453,i heard that as well . are you a marvel comics fan in general ?
16454,i would consider myself one yes . especially since i read they made a super hero with a hearing aid just because a boy was uncomfortable with how own .
16455,i used to like reading the comics when i was younger . i heard that in 1998 marvel offered all the movie rights to almost all the characters to sony and they rejected .
16456,"well that is good news for disney ! they are doing well it seems , since star wars out earned prequels by 1 . 3 billion . i bet disney will do well with these upcoming movies ."
16457,"yeah i think buying the star wars rights was a brilliant move , that should pay off for years to come ."
16458,it is hard to believe black panther made 192 million dollars in just one weekend though . very impressive for a movie they were unsure would be popular .
16459,"yeah i agree , and i think they will make a bunch more black panther movies and others similar ."
16460,"it's hard to say if they will do as well , though . i think a lot of the success has to be because of coogler . creed was also a great movie that did very well ."
16461,"yeah i agree again , coogler was a huge part of the success it has seen ."
16462,can't really give all the credit to one person though . the main actor michael jordan was a great choice for the role .
16463,yeah i think he is a really good actor . i enjoyed creed much more than i was anticipating .
16464,do you go to the box office to buy your tickets or do you usually buy them online or some other source ?
16465,"i usually buy them online , so i can pick my seat and know that i have a ticket ."
16466,"my local theaters are usually not very busy , so i just buy them at the box office ."
16467,i can understand that then . it was nice chatting with you today .
16468,it was nice chatting with you as well . take care .
16469,"yep , have a good night ."
16470,you too !
16471,hi ! are you a fan of superheroes ?
16472,i dont really follow comics and superheroes much . you ?
16473,not much really . lol i've been reading about them this morning . there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states .
16474,how does one register a superhero ? i would like to have my own superhero .
16475,i have no idea ! i think you can register anything that you create . there was a garfield book series spinoff named pet force which featured garfield and his gang as superheroes . lol
16476,that probably was funnier than the regular garfield . why was that comic even started ? i never liked it .
16477,lol i have no idea . there was a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes .
16478,what a job . cleaning up the mess of heroes . a thankless job . i wonder how much it paid .
16479,"probably not much . marvel comics creator stan lee wrote 15 dc comics , reimagining popular superheroes like batman and spiderman . they were squeezing all the cash they could out of them even back in the day . lol"
16480,i wonder why stan was working for dc . i guess they paid him a ton .
16481,probably . what do you do when you run out of new ideas for superheroes ?
16482,"um , i guess you hire a team of monkeys , stick them in front of typewriters , and have them work for a hundred years ?"
16483,lol close . . . you create a new superhero called ' normalman ' and you make him the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes ! lol
16484,opposite world ? that sounds like a weird place . normalman is anything but normal on that planet .
16485,lol disney does not own the rights to show big marvel charactes in theme parks east of the mississippi due to a contract marvel signed with universal studios in the 90s . interesting .
16486,"disney seems to be buying more and more . they have marvel , star wars . in the future , it will all be disney ."
16487,you're not kidding there . marvel comics created a superhero called blue ear just for a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing hearing aids which he needed . the boy told his mom that superheroes don't wear hearing aids so marvel then created the character .
16488,that is really cool of marvel . i bet the kid was stoked to see that
16489,i bet he was . good to see a feel good story like that . it's been fun chatting with you ! i learned a lot about superheroes and comics ! lol
16490,"yes , i enjoyed chatting too ! have a good day !"
16491,you have a good day as well !
16492,"hello there , are you a comic book fan ?"
16493,"i'm not very into reading them , but i'm a sucker for any marvel or dc comic movie !"
16494,"i haven't seen too many of the films , but i used to read the comics and watch xmen a lot ."
16495,ah . so you didn't see blank panther ? it was awesome .
16496,no i didn't see that one but heard it was really good .
16497,"yeah , i didn't know black panther is technically the richest superhero . tony stark is second , but way far off than bp ."
16498,"that is crazy , i never knew there was one that had more money than those two ."
16499,"yeah , apparently black panther is estimated to be worth around 500 billion , while tony stark is only 100 million . bruce wayne networth is 80 billion . i guess it makes sense , black panther is like , the king of a whole country ."
16500,"i will have to see the movie , it will most likely make more sense then ."
16501,"it's basically about a king who became king when his father dies , then another guy challenges the legitimacy of his sovereignty and they duke it out ."
16502,"that is interesting , i head they used historical symbols in the movie as well ."
16503,"yeah , some symbols from as early as the 4th century ."
16504,"wow , that is very cool , i love it when they use historical stuff in movies ."
16505,"apparently , the name for black panther predates the political group . that's weird ."
16506,"that is weird , i think they briefly changed the name to avoid being confused with the party ."
16507,"yeah , i can see how that would be a little controversial . they also had an issue with an indian translation because one of the character's sayings because it was a villain praising a hindu god ."
16508,"that is true , i think they made changes as to not offend anyone and it backfired ."
16509,"did you know the creator of marvel , stan lee , envisioned several dc comics characters ? that would be neat to see ."
16510,"no i didn't , yeah that would be very cool to see what he had up his sleeve ."
16511,"yeah , i wonder what batman or superman would be in a marvelstyle world . way more colorful and humorous !"
16512,"right , well we can wonder . it's been good talking with you today , i hope you have a good one !"
16513,did you watch the black panther movie ?
16514,"i did , i saw it in theaters last year and loved it . did you ?"
16515,"i loved it as well , chadwick boseman is a great actor , i loved his role on the movie"
16516,"yea he was great as tchala , but michael b jordan was even better . his performance as killmonger was amazing"
16517,"i agree , his role in the movie was great , you know that in the comics he is the richest superhero"
16518,"i don't doubt it , he is a diplomat from a raw material rich nation . though i'm kind of surprised he has more than tony stark"
16519,yeah more than stark and batman combined 2 times
16520,wow . did you know sony actually turned down all of these film rights back in the day when they only cost a measily 25 million ? they only wanted spidey
16521,"i bet they are regretting that decision now since each hero is worth like a hundred times more that value , spiderman is my favorite hero though"
16522,"he's definitely up there for me . back then though i bet no one had any idea all of these heroes would be so huge . really only xmen , fantastic 4 , and spiderman were the well known marvel properties , which were all snatched up"
16523,do you have a favorite marvel hero ? mine is tony stark he is a badass
16524,"i like a lot of them but my favorites might be spiderman or wolverine . everyone is pretty awesome though . i wish hugh jackman wasn't done with the role , he was perfect for it"
16525,"i agree and it would be nice to watch a deadpool vs wolverine movie , it would be awesome ! like one of the highest box office movies of all time"
16526,"seriously , with how popular deadpool is and how much publicity their ' feud ' is getting lately . maybe this is all some sort of grand marketing scheme ?"
16527,"it could be , there are a lot of hints in the deadpool movie about a merge including both"
16528,that would be awesome to see . did you know stan lee has actually written 15 comics for dc ? he's not just a marvel guy
16529,"that's amazing , i have to read those , there's is a hero called blue ear , the story behind his creation is an interesting one"
16530,"is it ? i've never heard of him before , tell me about it"
16531,"ok so blue ear is a hero created for a 4 year old boy who felt insecure about his hearing aid devices , so marvel created the hero to help him and his mom"
16532,oh that's so nice of them ! making all kids feel like they can be a hero too
16533,"i know right , helping a kid like that , an admirable thing to do , i wish more companies followed that example , robert downey jr also cheers up children with special conditions ."
16534,hi how are you ?
16535,i'm great thanks . did you see the movie black panther ?
16536,i did but i fell asleep through most of it . did you ?
16537,i have not seen it yet . the richest superhero is black panther . did you know that ?
16538,i did ! he has an estimated 500 billion dollars !
16539,that's crazy ! the symbols in black panther are based on an actual script called nsibdi .
16540,nsibdi dated back to the 4th century and is indigenous to present day nigeria !
16541,that's pretty old then . black panther was actually not named after the black panther party .
16542,makes sense ! he is worth more than tony stark and bruce wayne combined !
16543,that's insane . do you like marvel ?
16544,i do ! did you know disney does not own the rights to show big marvel characters in theme parks east of the mississippi ?
16545,i did not know that . that's really interesting .
16546,it was due to a contract marvel signed with universal in the 90s .
16547,interesting . there is one character owned by both marvel and dc who's name is access .
16548,i heard his only purpose is to try and keep both companies universes separate .
16549,that's odd . did you know there was a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes ?
16550,i did not . probably a good idea since they cause so much damage .
16551,i agree . there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states .
16552,that is so many . my uncle actually was friends with stan lee who wrote 15 dc comics .
16553,that's pretty awesome ! i can't believe he passed away recently . he lived a long life though . filled with lots of fun and adventure .
16554,yes he definitely lived a good life .
16555,well it was great chatting with you . tell your uncle sorry for his loss .
16556,did you watch black panther ?
16557,"not yet , but i have heard good things about it and am looking forward to seeing it . you ?"
16558,"i watched it and really liked it , the leading actor really sole the role of t'challa"
16559,black panther is supposed to be the richest superhero . does it show in the movie ?
16560,"it does , he is basically the king of wakanda , theres a lot of cool tech in the movie"
16561,"so , is it like batman , or what ? black panther has 500 billion vs 80 billion for bruce wayne , so he could afford some pretty nice tech gadgets !"
16562,"yeah kind of , only richer than him and stark together"
16563,"nice . so , i heard forest whitaker is in this movie . i enjoy his performances in other movies . what is his role in this ?"
16564,"im not sure , he is part of the cast but i cant recall who he is , the cast is great though"
16565,"so , i hear chadwick boseman is great in this . there is a great backstory to chadwick having some of his education funded by denzel washington , and the movie premiere brought them together so he could thank denzel . neat , huh ?"
16566,"i heard about that , i think denzel has a great heart , chadwick thanked him over the premiere of the movie"
16567,"denzel has some awesome inspirational speeches on youtube that you would probably enjoy seeing . i know i did . so , in the movie , was there reference to the nigerian nsibdi script that the story features ?"
16568,"i didnt know that , but that is really cool sounds like the directors , scripts writers did a great job researching , so are you a fan of marvel comics ?"
16569,"in general , yes , although i am behind in my watching of movies . . . sounds like you are , am i right ?"
16570,"i am , big fan so i watch them as they come out , in 2009 disney bought the franchise"
16571,"i thought disney didn't have the rights to the characters . is this true ? fantastic four was my favorite growing up , along with spiderman . . . how about you ?"
16572,"i liked iron man and also liked batman , but his from dc comics , you know they actually own a character together"
16573,"yeah . it sounds weird , but i guess it somehow helps them to keep their universes separate . i wonder how it works ?"
16574,i guess that character is not necessary but it works for them .
16575,did you know that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the us ? i wonder if ' normalman ' is one of them ?
16576,"i didn't know that , and he must be , normalman the hero without any powers ."
16577,did you hear that the richest superhero is actually the black panther at 500 billion ?
16578,"i didn't . that's amazing , 500 million dollars is a lot for a superhero to have . i learned a lot about black panther"
16579,in 1989 sony was offered cinematic rights to almost all of the marvel characters for only 25 million and they rejected only purchasing spiderman rights for 10 million
16580,"wow ! i learned that michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics in the early 1990's , so that he could play spiderman . spiderman is definitely a popular superhero ."
16581,that's interesting . the symbols and written script in black panther are based on actual script called nsibdi from the 4th century
16582,it is truly interesting how many details go into the marvel universe . black panther was the 18th film in the marvel cinematic universe and there are at least 30 superhero movies set to be released between 20162020 .
16583,yes it is . did you hear that black panther wasn't named after the black panther party and its name was black leopard for some time
16584,"i didn't ! i actually haven't seen black panther , but i want to after learning more . the actor that played black panther actually went to school with money from denzel washington !"
16585,marvel did some censoring of the utterance ' praise hanuman ' due to possible backlash .
16586,"i'm not sure what that is referring to , but i'll look into it . the actor that plays the villain's father , n'jobu is from the hit television show this is us . he happens to be my favorite character , which makes me want to watch it more ."
16587,marvel was able to successfully argue that mutants aren't people to get to pay lower rates on xmen toys than dolls because they are not human
16588,that's bizarre ! marvel also published a generic comic book to trademark the names ' superhero ' and ' supervillain . ' strange indeed .
16589,"surprisingly , disney doesn't own rights to show ' big ' marvel characters in them parks east of the mississippi because of a contract with universal in the 90's ."
16590,interesting ! the walt disney company didn't even buy marvel until 2009 .
16591,there was a comic series concerning fixing collateral damage caused by superheroes
16592,"that's always bothered me about the avengers movies . they cause major destruction . thanos made his debut in the avengers ' infinity war ' that came out on may 4 , 2018 ."
16593,don't you hate that the bad guy almost always dies at the end of the superhero movies ? they are so predictable .
16594,"they really are ! according to what i learned though , some of the villain or superhero interactions in black panther are different than in other marvel movies ."
16595,how are they different ?
16596,"michael b . jordan creates a more dynamic , creative villain than seen before . he has even been compared to heath ledger's joker , which in my opinion , is the greatest superhero villain ."
16597,one character is owned by both marvel and dc named access and his purpose is to keep both companies' universes separate . i don't know how that works though .
16598,me either ! good chatting with you . thanks for the new information . i am going to see if black panther is still on netflix to watch tonight .
16599,sounds good ! there are over 300 registered superheroes so it sounds like we can watch a lot .
16600,"hi , did you ever watch the black panther ?"
16601,"no , but i heard it was good but i'm not really into the superhero thing in general ."
16602,it is really good . and the character is actually the wealthiest of them all
16603,i heard jill scott tweeted that it beat star wars .
16604,i think so too . the symbols used in the movie date back to 4th century
16605,interesting . i heard it invigorated the superhero genre as well as reigning over other movies like the avengers .
16606,yeah that is for sure . did you know chadwick boseman was accepted into a prestigious summer theatre camp at oxford but could not afford to go ?
16607,"until now , i've never heard the name . i do know that it has nothing to do with the black panther party ."
16608,yeah he managed to go anyways from a private sponsor who turned out to be denzel washington
16609,i had no idea that comic book characters would be worth so much . the rights to spiderman went for 10m
16610,i cannot believe sony did not but more superhero rights but just spiderman
16611,"yeah , it's not like they don't have the bucks . i thought superheroes went back further than the 1930s . i suppose they do if you've ever read homer ."
16612,yeah i am sure they do . do you know who is the character access ?
16613,no before now . i also didn't know there was one called ' normalman ' a guy that has no superpowers . i guess i'm a ' normalman . '
16614,yeah that is strange . access actually does not have powers just keep marvel and dc universes separate
16615,"i hadn't heard of ' blue ear , ' a superhero marvel created for a 4 year old boy that didn't like wearing his hearing aid . that was nice . . ."
16616,that was super nice for sure . did you know marvel successfully argued that mutants are not people in court ?
16617,that's strange . . . poor bruce wayne . . . he's only worth 80b and tony stark's worth 100b .
16618,and not to think of all the collateral damage that superheroes cause
16619,"yeah , i wonder who carries their liability insurance . maybe the black panther who's worth 500b ?"
16620,hahha i bet . nice chat .
16621,hello ! did you now there's a superhero called ' normalman ' ?
16622,"yes , mostly of kids and children are like superhero now days adult and aged people also love this character ."
16623,i guess superhero is a great business ! a lot of people are waiting for the next superhero movie .
16624,the main aim of the superhero to protect the people from the evil and save from the distracter .
16625,one of the biggest companies to make money out of superheroes is marvel . they even make money out of toys ! !
16626,the are publish the comics books for kids . the walt disney company acquired marvel entertainment . it make the children to good and they support to live the self discipline .
16627,that makes disney a monster company ! they own most of the market !
16628,michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics in the early 1990's but it not happened for some reason . otherwise he became the hero of spiderman movie .
16629,michael jackson made some great deals ! he bought the rights of all the music from the beatles . and that'a lot money ! !
16630,sure ! the word superhero is commonly used for women also . there are some women superheros .
16631,yes . superhero movies would be dead without women superheros !
16632,black panther brings life to marvel ' s greatest superhero . jordan's unforgettable performance as the classic villain .
16633,seems like he did a good job portraying the villain ! sometimes villains are the best in a movie !
16634,villains character designed very differently so only people like superhero very much .
16635,"sadly superheros are not as good as they seem . most of them can not control their rage , are violent , and kill as much people as the villains !"
16636,sure . marvel published comic book in the superhero . it attract the children and also all aged people especially in since 1930s .
16637,"as we were talking before , it's a great business ! the publish only what they know people are going to like !"
16638,it develop reading habit among the children . it is biggest change over in the world . mostly reading comics books is nice .
16639,"im surprised that marvel could win a case in court saying their characters are not humans , and then to have their taxed reduced !"
16640,i think it is very funny thing .
16641,"it was very nice talking to you , have a great day !"
16642,thank you . wish you the same .
16643,great day ! !
16644,who is your favourite superhero ?
16645,spid
16646,hi have you seen the black panter movie ?
16647,yeah ! i really like michael b . jordan as the villain erik killmonger !
16648,nice ! did you know that the richest superhero is actually black panter ? he has an estimated 500 billion dollars !
16649,holy cow . marvel has so much money ! they have created so many superheroes !
16650,yes ! tony stark is worth 100 billion and bruce wayne is worth 80 billion as well !
16651,amazing . the marvel brand began all the way back in 1961 .
16652,wow . i didn't know that . there is one character owned by both marvel and dc named access . never heard of them .
16653,i wonder if he will be in a movie soon . michael jackson saw the importance and tried to buy marvel in the 90's !
16654,wow . i didn't know that . he probably would have done some amazing things with the brand i would think .
16655,yeah agreed . he wanted to buy it so he could play spiderman that would have been interesting lol .
16656,neat ! i never knew that . did you know that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states ?
16657,wish they were better at their job lol ! i am grateful for stan lee creating all the characters in his universe !
16658,yes ! he created a nice industry for people to get involved with and be entertained . did you ever read comic books ?
16659,as a child sometimes . marvel once published a generic comicbook . . . that would be interesting to see .
16660,that would be ! there was a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes ! lol
16661,oh i always wondered about all the damage they caused . sir isaac newton was once a sorcerer supreme in the marvel universe !
16662,i never knew that ! did you know that there is a superhero called normalman ? he was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes !
16663,haha that would not be a fun movie to see ! there was once something called pet force which featured garfield as a superhero !
16664,nice ! i never knew that . i loved garfield . stan lee wrote 15 dc comics reimagining popular superheroes like batman and superman . i didn't know that .
16665,"he was such a visionary . there is actually a book called becoming batman , written by a neuroscientist ."
16666,yes he was ! sad he died this past year . it's been a pleasure chatting with you !
16667,did you see ' black panther ' ?
16668,"no , was it a good movie ? i read it stars michael b . jordan as ' black panther ' and erik killmonger"
16669,"he was great as a villain , some says he was the best ."
16670,it seems like villains have done a better job recently after the creation of avengers : infinity wars
16671,they did modify his story to give him more depth .
16672,thanos will most likely make his mark making nearly every mcu movie hero try to stop him .
16673,"yeah , but in the case of killmonger , his humanity come from his link with his father . n'jobu ."
16674,"i have to correct myself that jordan actually stars as the villain killmonger , not black panther . i appreciate the fact that they are making superheroes more diverse as well with black panther being the greatest black superhero from marvel"
16675,and killmonger being the best villain in the mcu makes it more diverse .
16676,n'jobu played a great role even though it was limited to flashbacks and dream sequences he had a huge emotional impact on the movie .
16677,"by understanding his point of view his radicalization , it make killmonger more complex and more interesting ."
16678,the villain must always fall in mcu but killmonger will be remembered !
16679,do you thanos will achieve the same success as a villain ?
16680,"i'm not sure he'll have the same passion , but he will be a contender with all his strength being that all the superheroes will have to unite to fight him"
16681,to think that marvel offered the rights of all its superheroes o for sony for only 25 million they could have lost a lot of money if they accepted .
16682,that is probably true . marvel has a soft spot though . they created superhero hearing aids that were a ' blue ear ' for a 4 year old who was uncomfortable wearing them .
16683,"that is cute , but who has rights to sell what with the marvels heroes is very complicated , like disney that can't show any marvel chaacters in its theme parks because universal has bought them ."
16684,michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics because he wanted to play spiderman in his own produced movie . i wonder how that would have gone ?
16685,"that would have been special , reimagining heroes has also been done by stan lee with superman and batman . it can be interesting ."
16686,did you know garfield had a special spinoff series where garfield and his gang were superheroes ?
16687,"i suppose it was not good , since i never heard of it , so much superheroes , 300 are registered in in the us ."
16688,"also , there are 30 or more superhero movies set for release between 2016 and 2020 . i hope they stay exciting ! nice talking with you ."
16689,"hello , are you a fan of superhero movies ?"
16690,"hey there i do like superhero movies . did you ever like garfield by the way ? apparently they did a spinoff we're all of the garfield characters were superheroes , i need to check that out"
16691,wow i never knew that ! i wonder how often superheros come from comic books . i once read a comic series on fixing collateral damage caused by superheros .
16692,wow how was it ? that's a very interesting topic for a superhero story i think . i can't believe how popular superhero movies are though . between the years 2016 and 2020 they are going to release about 30 superhero movies
16693,it was definitely interesintg ! there's so many superheroes though it's hard to quantify how much damage they cause . there's still over 300 registered superheroes in the us .
16694,wow that is a lot ! have you heard of stan lee ? he created a lot of classic marvel characters . but apparently he was about to change careers but then at the last minute they let him experiment . he made character such as spiderman and daredevil
16695,"i didn't know he wanted to switch careers ! we're definitely lucky he didn't . i wonder who's considered the most influential out of superhero creators like steve ditko , stan lee and jack kirby ."
16696,"yep those are all big names . i think that stan lee is actually kind of overrated , the more you read about him , but he did do some good things for the industry . did you know there's a book that someone wrote about how to become batman lol i want to read that and then do it haha"
16697,"wow i have no idea why people would think the need for that haha . i wonder what's more unneccessary , that book or the creation of a superhero literally called ' normalman ' , who didn't have any superpowers ."
16698,haha that does sound pretty unnecessary . do you like marvel comics ? or do you like dc comics more by the way ?
16699,"hmm i think i like marvel more . although they have shady dealings , like arguing in court that mutants aren't people , in order to avoid paying a higher rate on toys ."
16700,"yep that is very shady . i like that michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics . he wanted to play spiderman , that would have been a weird movie lol"
16701,"oh wow that's surprising . it's interesting they didn't sell it to him . they once tried to sell the rights to all their characters to sony for 25 million , but they rejected the offer ."
16702,i think that i heard about that . a very dumb move that sony didn't buy that lol . what about the superhero called blue ear ? have you heard of him
16703,"i have not ! it sounds like a very different superhero than we're used to , what's unique about him ?"
16704,"well he was written for a fouryearold actually the fouryearold said that no superheroes had hearing aids , and so marvel made him specifically for that 4 year old boy . that's pretty nice of them"
16705,"aww , yeah that's definitely sweet of them , and progressive . i doubt it was ever as successful was black panther though , which was obviously created for different purposes ."
16706,"yep i agree with you . did you ever see the movie black panther by the way ? i thought it was ok , nothing special"
16707,"i did ! yeah i thought it was alright , i thought it was interesting that the main character is actually the richest superhero in history ."
16708,"i thought that was interesting too . i think he's even richer than tony stark apparently . did you hear how denzel washington actually loaned the main character money in real life ? and then chadwick boseman thanked denzel washington 20 years later , that's insane !"
16709,"i didn't know that ! that's certainly some story , and even makes me appreciate the film more . anyways it was nice talking to you , have a good night !"
16710,hello do you like marvel comics ?
16711,"good morning . i do , and i'm still mourning the death of stan lee . when my son goes to look at michigan state , i'm going to see if i can go look at the comic collection in their library , it's the largest public collection ."
16712,yea that was sad that he passed away . i saw that disney doesn't own the rights to show big marvel characters .
16713,"yeah , that is weird how the marvel universe is distributed . we were just at universal in florida , and they have all of the marvel characters there . which struck me odd , as disney in cali has marvel there too . i didn't know that it had to do with the contract from the 90's ."
16714,hmm . . i didn't know that either . there is one character owned by both marvel and dc named access .
16715,"i heard something about him . do you know who ultron is ? the only thing i can think of , is the iron man movie ."
16716,i do not know who that is . i saw that marvel created a comic book hero named blue ear and it was only for a four year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing his hearing aids .
16717,"that was a great thing they did . they based that on black bolt , and anson mount even met with the boy . stan lee signed off over tweet with ' excelsior ' , the same as he did his phone conversations ."
16718,that is pretty cool . i saw that stan lee ends every phone call he has with the word excelsior .
16719,"that's what i just said , lol . have you seen the garfield comic , pet force ?"
16720,i have not . what is it ?
16721,"garfield and his friends are super heroes . it's cute . there is a superhero called ' normalman ' , he lives on a planet full of superheroes , and yet he has none ."
16722,i didn't know they were super heroes . that's interesting about normalman .
16723,"who is your favorite ? mine is the winter soldier , and i think loki whines too much ."
16724,i would say i love wolverine . i saw there is a comic series about fixing collateral damage caused by superheroes .
16725,"i cannot watch a nonx men movie with hugh jackman in it , and not call him wolverine . even austrlia , and the greatest showman . i have never heard of that series , i wonder if it has normal man in it or"
16726,that's interesting . there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states . not really sure what that means lol .
16727,"i can believe it , as there are always more being added to the films . i was surprised to see red skull at the end of infinity wars . i think he has a bigger role in end games . i still have trouble believing that sony purchased the rights to spiderman for 10 million ."
16728,i can't believe that either . i didn't think it was worth 10 million .
16729,"i just wish they would stop redoing the spidey movies , and come up with new content . did you know that the dc stands for detective comics ?"
16730,it was great talking with you
16731,are you a stan lee or comic fan ?
16732,i am . i love watching for him in his movies . you ?
16733,"i do , funny he makes a cameo in his films . he does a very good job of making his characters relatable with problems too ."
16734,yes he does . i think that is what makes his films so good . stan lee looked pretty good to be 95 though !
16735,absolutley ! i wasn't convinced he was that old .
16736,me either . no where near it ! have you seen avengers ?
16737,"i saw the first one , but not infinity war yet . mostly due to kids . how about you ?"
16738,i saw infinity on netflix i think . was soo good . really neat to see all the characters come together .
16739,"yea , seeing how they use their strengths together . i'll definitely watch infinity when i have time ."
16740,stan lee made it where all those characters shared a world . very relatable .
16741,"oh definitely , they need to have some level of weakness to be more human"
16742,to see the marvel characters struggling just like we do makes his films relatable and fun .
16743,"like how spiderman has problems with his family , and finds himself awkward around mj"
16744,very nice for kids to see . did you know marvel had to go to court to prove that mutants weren't real ?
16745,i did not know that
16746,it was so they could pay a lower tax rate on the xmen toys .
16747,really ? so tax rates are lower for nonexistent things like that ? strange
16748,marvel also created a superhero called blue ear just for a boy who wears hearing aids .
16749,i see that marvel tried to sell sony the rights to almost all heroes and sony didn't buy .
16750,mistake on their part ! i would have loved to talk to stan lee on the phone and hear him say excelsior !
16751,"yup , a whole generation of comic lovers will miss that man !"
16752,have you been to many concerts ?
16753,no professional ones actually . you ?
16754,no but i would love to go see some of my favorite artists before they stop playing .
16755,i heard that lou reed and his wife once held a high frequency concert just for dogs !
16756,that is interesting . i wonder if the dogs appreciated it ?
16757,i would hope so ! do you like abba ? i did when i was a kid .
16758,i've never really listened to them . i was always more of a fan of either country or rock . i spent so much time listening to linkin park in college .
16759,i heard linkin park has held the most concerts ever . do you think that is true ? i always liked foo fighters myself .
16760,i know that they had 324 for their debut album in 2001 . i think the record would probably have to go to the ramones . can you imagine touring for 20 years straight ! ?
16761,that would be awful ! did you hear about the woman who picked dave matthews up on the way to his concert ? he was broke down !
16762,aw that is nice that she did that . can you imagine how many ticked off fans there would have been if he hadn't made it . it would have been a creed lawsuit repeat all over again .
16763,true ! all because he broke down . you ever listen to ariana grande ?
16764,a little . if it is on the radio i probably won't turn it but i don't go out of my way to listen to her . what about you ?
16765,"nah , she's far to young and all about the money for me . but i was surprised to learn she's not hispanic !"
16766,she is italian isn't she ?
16767,yeah ! that's what i read . but did you hear about her licking the donuts in that shop ? i bet it's hard to resist the sweets sometimes .
16768,that was so gross . she is quite young though so i will have to give her a pass on some of the behavior . i did a lot of dumb things at her age but there wasn't social media to document it all constantly .
16769,"thank god ! ! i didn't know she was on nickelodeon though , did you ?"
16770,yeah i used to watch victorious during my insomnia during college . she was always the best singer on the show even though she was just a supporting character .
16771,that's fun to know ! did you know that george clooney was on south park ? i had no idea !
16772,really ? was it one of those times where a celebrity voices themselves or did he have an actual character ?
16773,he was the dog sparky ! he only got to bark in the show !
16774,that is hilarious .
16775,"hi . are you familiar with american tv star , er , and film actor , george clooney ?"
16776,"yea , i know clooney has won 3 oscars and starred in the worst batman movie"
16777,"he did academy awards twice , for starring in the 2006 movie , syriana , and for producing the 2012 film , argo , starring ben affleck . tell me more about the batman movie . . ."
16778,"it was batman and robin , i think it was his first major movie after being on er"
16779,"just learned something new ! which of clooney's films or tv shows , if any , did or do you like ?"
16780,"i liked clooney in from dusk till dawn , that was an interesting movie"
16781,"i liked him in three kings , the satire gold heist set during the gulf war in iraq . did you know he's done some amazing humanitarian work for the less fortunate , too ?"
16782,"yea , clooney funded a satellite that documents war crimes in africa that the public doesn't know"
16783,"right . quiet stuff nobody much cares about . another star has done that , too : ariana grande . she's much younger than clooney . do you know her ?"
16784,"a little , i know grande is a pop singer"
16785,"yea , with a couple of songs on the radio now . she held a charity concert for victims or families of the recent manchester , england bombing . ariana raised 13 million dollars for them ."
16786,that's nice of her . apparently her song dangerous woman was written by 3 men
16787,"i know . who knew ? i've been to manchester , actually . a dusty , down and out working class city . 13m was really nice for those folks ! say , did you know ariana isn't hispanic , but italian american ?"
16788,"yea , i guess people confuse grande for being hispanic due to her last name and tan skin"
16789,i guess . did you know her from her nickelodeon tv days ?
16790,"no , i had no idea she was on nickelodeon"
16791,"she must have been pretty young . she's only 25 now . would you go to one of her concerts , or do you have another artist or group you'd rather see ?"
16792,"i'd rather go to her concert than a creed concert , their concert was so bad in 2002 a lawsuit was actually filed"
16793,"that must have been bad . go see the artists you want to , if you can , today . i always wanted to see pink floyd ; now i can only see their ' tribute ' band . which group is your favorite ?"
16794,"probably the red hot chilli peppers although i would've love to see the ramones play one of their 2 , 263 concerts"
16795,"chilis are one of my adult kid's alltime favs ! ramones a classic band . heard ticket prices are out of sight , as we used to say , but when the best stop touring , all you have is reruns and albums . . ."
16796,"yep . well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
16797,"hi , how are this afternoon ?"
16798,"great . are you by any chance a fan of the actor , george clooney ?"
16799,"yes , i am . how about you ?"
16800,"have loved this actor since his days on the tv drama , er , 1994 1999 , , but have really become a dedicated fan of his movies . which one is your favorite ?"
16801,"i loved him on er , i remember him on roseanne , and i really loved him in dusk till dawn ."
16802,"yes , that was his breakthrough role . i liked the satire , three kings , too , and syriana , for which he won an oscar . what do you suppose is his greatest appeal ?"
16803,"he's got some smoldering sex appeal , boy next door quality that a lot of women like . i read somewhere that he helped fund a satellite that documents and records war atrocities in africa that would otherwise be ignored . he apparently is very globally involved ."
16804,"yes , along with being the only actor ever nominated for an oscar in 6 different award categories . agree on the sex appeal , especially if he lived next door ! clooney is an advocate for a variety of international causes , along with his wife , a human rights attorney ."
16805,"his wife is gorgeous , by the way , as well as smart . lucky man . i did not know that he was distantly related to abe lincoln , though ."
16806,"me , either . much easier on the eyes than honest abe ! another celebrity , ariana grande , born 1993 , has also led humanitarian efforts , and started doing so at an early age . are you familiar with her music ?"
16807,"yes , i love her music . i read somewhere that she was the first fan hit by a hockey puck at the florida pather's current arena when she was 5 years old ."
16808,"thank goodness it didn't damage her seriously . understand that she appeared in the broadway hit , 13 , at the age of 13 , has appeared on other theatre and tv shows and voiced animated tv and films as well ."
16809,"very talented young lady , for sure . i used to think she was hispanic , but now i understand she is of italian heritage ."
16810,"that's right . correction : ariana was 15 when she appeared on broadway . but she was only 10 when she cofounded a youth group , kids who care , which sang at charity events . pretty admirable ."
16811,"yes , it is . did you know her female empowerment hit , ' dangerous woman ' was actually written by 3 men ?"
16812,"really ? go figure . i became aware of ariana after her charity concert for victims of the manchester , england bombing . the girl raised 13 to help victims and their families . manchester is a gritty , working class city . i'm sure victims were grateful , and really needed the money ."
16813,very good for her to do that for the people affected by the manchester bombing
16814,yes . correction again : ariana raised 13 million for manchester . concerts in front of live audiences can be a powerful venue . any favorite concerts you've ever attended ?
16815,no problem . i went to see lynyrd skynyrdon their farewell tour in their hometown last summer and i'm going to see mick and the rolling stones this summer .
16816,"i'm jealous . never saw a live stones concert . always wanted to . running out of time now . would also like to have seen pink floyd at the 1972 live concert they did in a roman amphitheater . in pompeii , no less ."
16817,"me too . that's the main reason i'm shelling out big bucks for the rolling stones . this is probably my last chance to see them . well , it's been nice chatting with you this afternoon . enjoy the rest of your day , friend ."
16818,"hi , do you know marvel comics ?"
16819,"yes , i know a little bit about them , are you a fan of them ?"
16820,yes i am . did you know they sold spiderman to sony for 10 million ?
16821,"wow , and it sounds like they had the chance to buy all of the characters rights but only wanted spiderman , that was a mistake ."
16822,big mistake they have made so much money from all the superheroes by now
16823,"oh yeah , and it is an endless stream of income when they can keep releases games and movies and all ."
16824,exactly . did you know they argued in court that mutants are not human ?
16825,"yeah i think i read that , was it so they could buy something for less money ?"
16826,yeah that was the reason . do you know who stan lee was ?
16827,yeah it was sad to hear that he passed recently . do you know what famous line he would end every phone call with ?
16828,yeah that is too sad . yeah he ended it with excelsior .
16829,"nice , good call ! do you watch most of the marvel movies ?"
16830,yeah as many as i can really . did you know there are 300 superheroes in the us ?
16831,"i would never have guessed there were that many . i wonder what the least craziest one is , like why did they make this one type ."
16832,well there is one called the normalman
16833,"really ? that is too funny , i wonder what his super power is , or he has a lot like reading the paper"
16834,"he is the only one without superpowers so not sure why he was created , that is all of us"
16835,yeah then we are all superheroes you are right . did you see the weird deal about owning some of the superheroes east of the mississippi ?
16836,yeah that is a strange contract right there .
16837,yeah it is . did you hear about the one they created for a 4year old boy ?
16838,yeah that is so nice of them . nice chat
16839,hey how you doing . do you like marvel comics ? stan lee is a genius !
16840,"i don't know much about the characters , but they seem really popular ! marvel has been around under other names since 1939 ."
16841,that is a long time . in 2009 the walt disney company acquired marvel worldwide's parent company .
16842,that was a good move on their part ! there are about 30 movies with superheros in them in the works .
16843,wow that is a lot of superhero movies . back in 1998 marvel offered the cinematic rights of almost all of its characters to sony for only 25 million .
16844,"that's amazing considering what they're worth now . in 1938 , dc comics bought batman for 130 !"
16845,true . that is hard to believe ! one character named access is owned by both marvel and dc .
16846,that's kind of neat . marvel made a superhero that wears hearing aids for a little boy who had to wear them .
16847,"that is so cute of them . that character i mentioned named access , has a sole purpose of trying to keep the two universe's is separate ."
16848,too funny . the first comic book ever was called famous funnies and came out in 1933 .
16849,wow that is a long time ago . comic books were so popular back then . they were even popular in the united kingdom too .
16850,"yeah . comic books were originally funny , but now they are more storytelling ."
16851,very interesting how they came to be . the michigan state university library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world .
16852,i bet that's cool to see . did you know michael jackson tried to buy marvel ?
16853,i never knew that . he probably had enough money . there are actually 300 registered superheroes in the usa .
16854,"that's awesome . yeah , he wanted to be able to play spiderman in his own movie !"
16855,i don't know if he would make a good spiderman lol . maybe he should play normalman . the only superhero without superpowers .
16856,"wow ! there really is a superhero for everything ! there was a superhero called braniac , too ."
16857,i would love to be brainiac ! apparently stan lee ends every phone conversation he has with the word excelsior . thanks for chatting with me today .
16858,what a cool guy ! thank you too . have a great day !
16859,have a good afternoon !
16860,"hi , how are you ? do you like comics and superheroes and stuff ?"
16861,hi . i'm not so much into that any more . when i was younger yes . but i like talking about some of the odd facts .
16862,"yes , the odd facts seem to crop up in these chats . do you like marvel or dc ?"
16863,i have no preference . did you know there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states ?
16864,i would like to register a superhero . how would it do that ? i would like to register one for my friend .
16865,i don't know . what are your powers ?
16866,i can chat incessantly and make banal comments without respite . do you have superpowers ?
16867,wow that's impressive . yes i raised three kids and have not gone crazy
16868,that is impressive . you could be a superhero to dads everywhere . what other powers would you like ?
16869,oh wow that's hard . i would like to be able to be invisible . how about you ?
16870,i would like to know the future or read peoples minds . that would be great . i would be able to see what people are thinking and freak them out .
16871,that would be fun . you would also be able to win the lottery whenever you felt like . kind of like the guy in back to the future .
16872,"yeah , biff ? yes , he warnt too smart but he had the book . i could be a biff . yeah ."
16873,don't be a biff . be a nice guy and help people .
16874,"yeah , i guess i should donate some winnings to others and just keep enough for myself to live ."
16875,very well . did you know there was a garfield book series which featured garfield and gang as superheroes .
16876,"garfield is boring to me . superhero status might be funny . yeah , i would read that ."
16877,that's what i mean . one of my favorites is the hulk . think how great it would be be turn into a big green monster whenever someone ticked you off .
16878,"yeah , i guess you wouldnt get invited back to parties much . plus you would have to have magical expanding jeans . anyway , great chat !"
16879,thanks . nice to chat with someone who can keep a conversation rolling . have a good night .
16880,have a great weekend !
16881,you too .
16882,"hollywood sure misses stan lee , one of its legends"
16883,it's a shame stan lee passed away at 95
16884,"it is , the creater of iron man , thor , spider man and many others , he sure changed my childhood"
16885,"yes , stan lee popularized the sharedworld of superhero storytelling , truly a great innovater"
16886,"i agree and also with the phrase , ''whithout stan lee , hollywood as we know it might not exist'' he was of great contributioin and left a big legacy behing"
16887,"yea , without stan lee there would of never been an iron man movie in 2008"
16888,"and then the movies of the avenegers and the other characters , fantastic 4 , black panther ,"
16889,"yea , lee's comic writing in the 1960s really changed cinema"
16890,do you have a favorite marvel hero ? mine has to be iron man or captain america
16891,"i like the xmen , it's funny marvel comics had to convince the us government that xmen weren't humans"
16892,"i guess they made a lot of money with that argument , disney bought the whole franchise right ?"
16893,"yea , thank god michael jackson didn't buy marvel comics , he wanted to star and produce his own spiderman movie"
16894,"thank god he didnt lol , i agree with you , that would ruin the childhoods of many in the country ."
16895,"yea , maybe they could cast mj as the marvel hero blue ear"
16896,if he was still alive i bet they could and who is blue ear ? havent heard of him before ?
16897,"blue ear is a superhero who wears hearing aids , i guess he doesn't do anything else lol"
16898,"that sounds like a bad superpower lol , you know there are over 300 registered superheroes in the us"
16899,"i had no clue , i guess they will be releasing a lot more superhero movies after the 30 set for release between 20162020"
16900,"its pure gold so yeah . i bet we will be seeing more heores in the future ,"
16901,"it be cool if they made one with the garfield pet force superheros , i loved that book as a kid"
16902,"it would be cool i agree , stan lee wrote 15 comics of dc comics"
16903,are you a fan of marvel comics ?
16904,"yeah , kinda . i did watch some marval movies ."
16905,"same here , i am a big spider man fan . i also like the blue ear character"
16906,"ohh actually i never heard of the blue ear character before i read about it recently . it's a interesting story , what does that character do in that comics ? i only know him as a character ."
16907,i believe his super power is super hearing . i hope they make a movie about him like aqua man
16908,"nice . that would be interesting , i'm not sure how super hearing is going to be like , punish the bad guys ? i could see it being a detective thing or something like that . or maybe his physical power is overpowering too ?"
16909,there is only one of their superhero characters that has no special powers .
16910,"ahh , the ' normal person ' guy ? i never heard of him before either . it's kinda sacarstic i like that idea . dunno how the plot is gonna go though ."
16911,i wonder how the other 300 superheros think of him ?
16912,"lol , could be anything . maybe they think he is the superhero , not them . still , how is this going to be a plot device besides daily life comady i'm not sure ."
16913,there are lots of male superheros and only a few female ones . i wonder if they will ever create a gay hero or gender neutral one
16914,"huh , maybe . i think there's a captain marvel movie next year , this year ? , , and she is a big character , i mean , her own movie , , and black widow i think . but i guess we can argue black widow is a side kick , so is scarlett witch ."
16915,i always had a crush on superwoman and catwoman
16916,"lol why ? i don't think they are marvel , i remember they are maybe dc ? i thought we are talking about marvel . i guess i can understand catwoman . . . superwoman maybe a little weird , no offense"
16917,"hard to keep the alliances straight some time . superheros have been around since the 30's , nearly 90 years now"
16918,"yep , that's definately a long time . i think doctor who has been around a pretty long time too , not sure which one is longer . makes me feel old thinking the 30s has been 90 years from now . what is alliances straight ?"
16919,hard to tell them from marvel or dc comics
16920,"ohh . yeah sometimes . it's a little confusing . i didn't watch much dc stuff , so i only know pretty much marvel stuff ."
16921,sad that the comic world lost stan lee this year
16922,"yeah , that was super sad for everybody . i heard he nearly got scammed by a young man out of his money earlier . it's sad when old people get old . did you understand the part saying he ends every phone call with ' excelsior ' ? i don't quite get it ."
16923,quirky for sure .
16924,do you have a favorite superhero ?
16925,i have collected comic books for years and stan lee's creations are some of my favorites . i love the xmen and spiderman . most marvel comic books i enjoy .
16926,"yeah , stan lee's creations are phenomenal ! there are over 300 registered superheroes , i wonder how many of those belong to stan ?"
16927,"i live in michigan , and have been to the msu library where they house the largest comic book collection in the world . it's pretty cool , to see in person ."
16928,"oh i didn't know there was such a place ! i visit michigan often , will have to go check it out some time . maybe i can find the character ' normalman ' in that library somewhere , did you know he existed ?"
16929,"yes , i actually knew of normalman . what i didn't know though was that stan lee wrote 15 dc , or detective comics , i always thought he was strictly a marvel man ."
16930,"really ? were any of those dc writings by stan lee made into movies ? i also didn't know that's what ' dc ' stood for , thanks for clarifying !"
16931,"i don't think the dc books were made into movies . dc can't seem to get past batman , superman , and wonder woman . marvel on the other hand is willing to take risks . marvel once created a character called blue ear just to help a 4 year old boy get used to wearing a hearing aid . marvel rocks ."
16932,"i know ! i'm a marvel over dc person too ! i wish they'd put that character in movies because i know someone with a hearing disability as well so that would help a lot ! surprised that disney doesn't own the rights to the wellknown marvel characters in theme contracts due to a contract , so who owns the rights to them ?"
16933,i know sony owns the rights to some of marvels characters like venom . marvel went through hard times back in the day and sold their rights to some characters off . they seem to be doing just fine today though making billions of dollars just with their movies .
16934,"was it bad management that led them to hard times ? or they just simply didn't know how to market their assets ? sony once had the opportunity to purchase all the characters but only chose spiderman , what a poor decision !"
16935,i've heard stan lee actually didn't run the business smoothly back in the day . he turned the reins over long ago . he got to busy making movie cameos . stan liked to end every phone conversation by using his catch phrase excelsior ! ! ! ! !
16936,"stan lee needs to focus on his creative and artistic talent ! not only does he make cameos in movies , i also enjoy trying to find his signatures on marvel characters when in theme parks . i think marvel found a great home in disney !"
16937,"yes disney will do great , they still don't own the rights to everything though like the avengers and xmen ."
16938,"how does one even begin to create characters and universes like what stan lee did , he even created a universe that takes place in earth199999 , which is a multiverse ."
16939,"stan was the man , but he had a lot of help from steve ditko and jack kirby . those are three comic book legends ."
16940,"oh , i've never heard of them but they are geniuses for sure ! have you ever read the series about fixing the collateral damage caused by the superheroes ?"
16941,i have not read that series . i have read a lot of comics from earth 616 which was marvels original comic book universe .
16942,"does it feature garfield in that setting , there's a series spinoff named pet force that featured garfield as the superhero ."
16943,"garfield was in pet force , a comic that didn't go very far . they say there are over 300 registered superheroes in the u . s . but i think that sounds kind of low ."
16944,"oh wow , i thought 300 was a lot already but considering that many series , i need to reconsider ."
16945,hi how are you ? do you like comic books ?
16946,i enjoy reading about comic books with superheroes sometimes .
16947,i don't read comic books much . i sometimes see the movies .
16948,"well comics are great sometimes , michael jackson even tried buying marvel comics once ."
16949,i guess he had the money . i wonder what he would have done with marvel .
16950,michael jackson wanted to play spiderman in his own produced movie apparently .
16951,"hm . a vanity project . i guess he could do it , but i prefer tobey for that role ."
16952,"well , marvel refused 60 years after they started , because they began in 1939 ."
16953,"yeah , that is good . disney probably paid quite a bit for marvel , but it was worth it in my opinion ."
16954,yes superhero movies are always profitable since it started in 1930 .
16955,"yes , the kids love them . i get tired of the sfx and the explosions . i guess i have gotten too old for them . i liked deadpool though ."
16956,well the kids are going to be pleased to hear that there are about 30 superhero movies set to release from now to 2020 .
16957,"oh boy . well , i hope that many of them are like deadpool with the potty mouths and the sassy adult humor ."
16958,"well , i'm just hoping there is more xmen . there should be more of that ."
16959,x men seems to have a lot of installments . i don't know it very well though . who is your favorite x man ?
16960,"i don't know , there are a couple to choose from ."
16961,wolverine ? professor x ? i don't know them well .
16962,"those are both pretty good , maybe instead of movies , i can read more comic books about them ."
16963,"well , maybe ill take another look at the xmen movies . anyway , great chat !"
16964,i should also take a look at other groups such as the avengers sometime . have a nice day or night !
16965,have a great weekend !
16966,you too !
16967,"hello , how are you today ? do you enjoy superhero's ?"
16968,"hi ! i love superheroes , actually ! in fact , i love all 300 registered superheroes in the us ! ha ! what about you ?"
16969,"yes , i enjoy the superhero movies too ! do you have a favorite ?"
16970,"i like them all , honestly . although there is a comic series where it's strictly centered around repairing all the collateral damage superheroes created i want to read hopefully soon !"
16971,"oh really , that sounds very interesting ! i think my favorite would be catwoman ! ! lol"
16972,that's awesome ! are you also a fan of stan lee ? did you know he actually ends every phone call with the word ' excelsior ' ? ha !
16973,"i heard of that ! lol1 did you know they have a superhero called blue ear ? it came from a 4 year old boy who had to wear uncomfortable hearing aids . i love that ! ! so cute , he told his mom superhero's don't wear hearing aids ."
16974,"that is a very cute story . i wouldn't mind reading that one ! i mentioned stan lee previously , did you also know he actually wrote 15 dc comics including batman and superman ?"
16975,"i love that ! there is also a superhero called normal man , have you heard of that ?"
16976,"i have , actually ! normalman was the only normal person on a planet full of superheroes . it's a very interesting concept , isn't it ?"
16977,"yes , i like it ! did you know that michigan state library has the largest collection of comic books ?"
16978,"wow ! i'd love to visit michigan state just for that reason , then ! i also think it's awesome that marvel published a generic comic book just to trademark the names supervillain and superhero ! ha ! that was smart of them !"
16979,very true ! have you heard of the character access ? its purpose is to keep separate both marvel and dc .
16980,"i have not but that's interesting ! speaking of dc , did you know that it stands for detective comics , which the name is pretty much redundant ? ha !"
16981,"yes , i knew that , good way to remember especially for children . have you seen the movie wonder woman yet ?"
16982,"i know who the character is and i think she's amazing ! i also think it's amazing the marvel branding began way back in 1961 the year they launched the fantastic four ! lee , ditko , kirby and others really took comics to the next level !"
16983,"that's interesting , i like the fantastic four ! ! i love the pet force with garfield , he makes me laugh just looking at him !"
16984,ha ! well did you know about the garfield book series spinoff named pet force ? it featured garfield and his gang as superheroes ! i bet that was hilarious too !
16985,"yes , that's what i meant pet force ! ! love it . did you know in 1941 wonder woman was placed in the justice society as a secretary ?"
16986,was she really ? that's wild as she's come a long way since then ! i also think it's wild that disney doesn't own the rights to the big named marvel characters in theme parks east of the mississippi ! apparently it's because of a contract marvel and universal studios signed back in the 90s !
16987,"yes , i remember when that happened ! i go to the universal park and disney world alot ! the new wonder woman in the new movie actually served 2 years as a soldier ! ! good chat ! !"
16988,"that's pretty cool ! boy , she's been around since close to the time marvel started back in 1939 as timely publications ! ha ! well it was good chatting with you ! hope you have a great day , friend !"
16989,you too ! yeah was the highest grossing ww1 movie ! !
16990,"that is amazing ! well , i'm off to research famous funnies which was the first modern comic book released in the us back in 1933 ! take care , friend !"
16991,hi there do you like marvel comics ?
16992,marvel comics are pretty good . what about you ?
16993,yeah i like marvel . the only comic i like from dc is batman actually . i remember when marvel was purchased by the disney company in 2009 . that seems like so long ago
16994,"disney has made so many superhero movies , i cannot keep track of them all ."
16995,nope it's just too much at this point . funny that marvel had offered in 1998 to all of its characters to sony for only 25 million dollars period that was a blunder by sony to not buy the whole thing
16996,"i guess sony wasn't hungry for stories . once the internet got going , the characters could be used for all kinds of entertainment . 25 mill is nothing ."
16997,yep i agree . that's why they only decided to purchase spiderman for 10 million . they thought he was the only character that audiences cared about . oh how wrong they were
16998,"if you can make a spiderman movie for a profit , there should be other movies that can be made . the executives are not creative . they don't understand narrative , just dollars ."
16999,yep that's what i think too . i guess there is actually a character that is shared between marvel and dc . his name is access . all he does is keep both companies universes separate which i think is a noble goal haha
17000,that would be an odd job to have . what if you fail ? who fires you ? and who pays you ? both marvel and dc ? i have questions .
17001,these are great questions haha . did you hear about the marvel superhero blue ear ?
17002,blue ear ? no i didn't . is he movieworthy ?
17003,"well apparently marvel created blue ear for an eightyearold boy who was wearing a hearing aid . it was to help him feel better about wearing a hearing aid because he said that superheroes don't wear hearing aids . therefore , when marvel heard that they created one that does"
17004,that's a great aid to a young fan . good for them !
17005,yep i think that was very noble . are there any comic books that you currently read ? i guess the first comic book was made in 1933
17006,i don't read comics now . i was interested as a kid .
17007,i like them as a kid too . i guess in real life stan lee would end every phone conversation he ever had with the word excelsior !
17008,stan the man ! he had a way about him . much better than jim davis . garfield ? was there ever a funny one ?
17009,haha that's a good point . i never got garfield but i thought he was ok i guess . did you know that dc in dc comics stands for detective comics
17010,"that's a bit redundant . anyway , i gotta go . i have a job as normalman on a planet full of superheroes ."
17011,great i'll keep an eye out for blue ear too haha . and check out the michigan state university comic book library
17012,are you a superhero fan ?
17013,i just saw the avengers movie and liked it
17014,"i missed that one , but i caught deadpool 2 this summer ."
17015,i have not seen that one but marvel makes a lot of good stuff . sony should have bought marvel when they had the chance
17016,they really should have . so man companies pass up and it ends up being a huge mistake .
17017,i love the fact that marvel created a superhero who needed hearing aids specifically for a little boy
17018,aww . it always touches me when big name companies do thing like that . it helps kids out so much .
17019,for sure . i think its funny that there is a character that is owned by both marvel and dc
17020,which one is that ?
17021,its name is access its whole purpose is to keep the 2 companie's universes separate
17022,wow . did you know marvel argued that mutants are not human to pay a lower rate on x men toys instead of the higer rate for dolls ?
17023,that seems like a good plan to me ! save money where you can . i like reading these characters in comic books as well as movies
17024,me too . i like how they were all misfits of a sort and finally found their place .
17025,marvel is pretty smart they published a generic comic book so they could trademark names like superhero
17026,and supervillian too . that was brilliant of them .
17027,i should have attended michigan state their library has a huge comic book collection
17028,"i bet that would be cool to visit , but they wouldnt let people check too many things out though . i bet they have some rare things ."
17029,for sure some old dc comics did you know dc stands for detective comics
17030,thats a bit redundant isnt it ? lol
17031,just a bit . . is that a stan lee one ? he is quite the character
17032,"he was indeed , ended each phone convo with excelsior !"
17033,yes there are different multiverses in his books !
17034,good morning ! do you like marvel movies or comics ?
17035,i love marvel comics and movies and stan lee . how about you ?
17036,same here ! i learned recently that marvel started way back in 1939 ! i had no idea !
17037,really ! ! that is a long time ago . do you know who acquired marvel entertainment ?
17038,"that i do know because of all of the uproar about it . it's disney , right ?"
17039,you're correct . it was the walt disney company . do you happen to know who created the fantastic four and other superhero titles ?
17040,i assume it was stan lee . i just always thought he did all of it .
17041,it was stan lee among others like steve ditko and jack kirby .
17042,"i'm not familiar with those two . hey , speaking of disney a bit ago . did you hear about them not owning the rights to show big marvel characters in theme parks ?"
17043,no i didn't . i also read somewhere that michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics in early 90s .
17044,i didn't know that ! do you know why he didn't ?
17045,he did it so that he could play spiderman in his own movie .
17046,oh ! that would have been interesting to see . it's odd that he failed though . marvel tried to sell movie rights of almost all of it's characters to sony back in 1998 but they said no .
17047,i guess the deal fell through between the two companies . i didn't know this
17048,"yeah , marvel wanted 25 million . sony rejected that and just bought the rights to spiderman for 10 million because they thought people only cared about him ."
17049,i didn't know this . thanks . did you know that dc comics paid 130 for the exclusive rights to superman ?
17050,"nope , but i'd say they got a heck of a deal ! superman has probably made them tons of money !"
17051,yes . superman did make them a lot of money indeed .
17052,i heard that dc from dc comics stands for detective comics .
17053,wow ! ! ! that is very interesting . i didn't know this .
17054,"something else that's interesting , at least to me that is , is that michigan state university library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world ! you should check it out . as for me , i've got to go now ! it's been great chatting with you ! have a great day !"
17055,good morning .
17056,good morning !
17057,the recent passing of stan lee is sad .
17058,"i agree ! i was never super into comics , but he was absolutely legendary for what he accomplished . it's awful to hear about the allegations of elder abuse though ."
17059,"yes it is . he seemed so devoted to his wife , she helped him build his empire ."
17060,"i can't imagine how heartbreaking it was for him to lose her , especially since they were together for seven decades . it's not surprising that everything seemed to go downhill after that ."
17061,the person taking care of him was arrested for filing a false claim . he was taking advantage or his age and health .
17062,that's awful ! it's disgusting how someone could take advantage of someone because they're old and senile . it's horrible the way they isolated him from his friends and loved ones toward the end of his life .
17063,did you know marvel comics started in 1939 !
17064,"oh my god ! that's insane . i had no idea they'd been around this long ! and it doesn't look like they're going anywhere , i heard 30 superhero movies were set to be released between 20162020 ."
17065,that is amazing . stan lee used to end all his phone conversations with the word ' excelsior '
17066,"that's adorable ! you know , i wonder if he regrets selling the rights to superman for only 130 ."
17067,"he has made so much , i am not sure if he regrets . there is a superhero called normalman !"
17068,now that's hilarious ! i'd totally consider watching a superhero movie if it was about this ' normalman '
17069,he is the only person on the planet without superpowers .
17070,are you a big fan of comics ?
17071,i am . i love reading them and watching all the movies . michigan state university library has the largest publicly available comic book collection .
17072,"cool ! which superhero is your favorite ? i had no idea ! that's awesome . apparently michael jackson really wanted to play spiderman , so much so that he tried to buy marvel comics in the 90's ."
17073,i like spider man . i also like aquaman . there is a new one coming out soon . i didn't know that about michael jackson .
17074,"i heard about aquaman ! jason momoa is gorgeous so i'll probably consider seeing that one . insane , right ? i'm glad they didn't sell to him ."
17075,ha . i was going to say the same about jason momoa did you know stan lee wrote 15 dc comics .
17076,"wow , i had no clue . it was really lovely talking to you today !"
17077,you too . i hope you have a great rest of the day .
17078,same to you !
17079,hey what did you think about stan lee when he was alive ?
17080,i thought he was a nice man . some believe hollywood as we know it now wouldn't be the same because of how he told superhero stories .
17081,"think you're right . it's amazing that he lived until the age of 95 , that's a long time and he had a lot of history with comic books and their promotion"
17082,apparently he wrote for dc comics at one point as opposed to marvel and reimagined batman and superman . i find that interesting .
17083,yes and i think the best thing about his creations were that they were always very relatable characters and not overpowered
17084,something i find funny is dc comics is detective comics comics . wonder how that got through corporate ?
17085,that is funny that that is what it stands for . what do you think about marvel comics though ? did you know sony rejected an offer to buy all of the rights to marvel comics for only 25 million dollars
17086,"i like marvel , they've been around since 1939 . they have a lot of cool characters like captain america and the hulk . what about you ?"
17087,"yeah i like marvel a lot more , i really like the xmen , it's interesting that disney does not have the rights to the xmen in theme parks that are east of the mississippi"
17088,i wonder if they are one of the over 300 registered superheroes in the united states ? i am assuming it is for copyright reasons .
17089,yeah that's a good question . what do you think about the superhero blue ear ? it was made specifically for a deaf child
17090,"never heard of it to be honest , sounds interesting . i do know of one called access who is a joint collaboration between dc and marvel ."
17091,"yeah you're right , that character can go between both sets of universes , the other thing i love about stanley is that you will end every phone call with the word excelsior , i miss him"
17092,well this whole superhero craze took off with iron man in 2008 . it introduced the idea of a universe of superheroes instead of them all in their own separate planet earth .
17093,yep i think that's a good idea . have you ever been to the world's largest comic book collection ? apparently that exists in the university of michigan library
17094,"no , i don't really collect them . i do like the movies though , black panther was really good . stan lee created him of course ."
17095,"are black panther was pretty good , what do you think about the idea of garfield as a superhero though"
17096,"why not ? he's got pals , i think it would be pretty funny . garfield always struck me as lazy though ."
17097,yeah maybe that's his superpower is laziness lol . they have a superhero named normalman so i don't think garfield would be a huge stretch
17098,"well ever since 1939 when it was named timely publications , marvel has been making comics and now they are owned by the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world so they must have done something right ."
17099,"i agree with you . it's crazy that comic book started in the 1930s to , that seems so long ago"
17100,hello . i would love to have joined the march for our lives
17101,i love the cause . it was about 2 million people
17102,oprah and clooney were benefactors . i am happy about that
17103,i bet that marjory stoneman douglas speech as powerful
17104,they had some good performers like ariana
17105,and the march was mostly women
17106,i remember the millions moms march back in 2000 . same cause
17107,there were mostly people over 18 in the march
17108,i love clooney . he will be 62 this year
17109,i loved him when he played on er as dr . ross
17110,i never knew that he is related to abraham lincoln
17111,i would love to see ariana grande in concert
17112,i love to go to concerts . the ramones played non stop for 20 years
17113,that creed concert must have been really bad
17114,ariana grande female empowerment song was written by men . wow !
17115,ariana is a very talented performer . i love her in nick
17116,i did not know she was italian either
17117,sam and cat was a good show . my kids love it
17118,well its good to know that all ages supported the march for our lives
17119,i learned a lot from this article .
17120,i did too . i learned a lot about marches around the country for a good cause .
17121,have a good night
17122,"i think that its unfair that gretat lindecrantz refused to testify , the life of someone is on the line ."
17123,after something like that i'd want to go home and listen to some music . . . do you like bruno mars ?
17124,"i do like bruno mars his one of my favorite artists , what about you , do you like him ?"
17125,"i do , but i didn't know until recently that his real name is peter gene hernandez ."
17126,i guess its a good thing his got an artistic name lol i dont see peter gene selling a lot of albums
17127,i wonder if he picked ' mars ' like the planet because he thinks he is ' out of this world . ' lol
17128,"i think thats accurate , i mean he truly is unique , he writes his own music and few artist do that"
17129,that is definitely unique ! so are the dogs i just heard about in moscow that have actually learned to ride the subway .
17130,"dogs are really smart so that doesnt surprise me , you know dogs are not colorblind the can also see colors but not as much as humans ."
17131,"i remember learning that on the sesame street show . i think bruno mars was on that show once , too !"
17132,"he was ? i missed that episode lol , mars was named after a wressler , bruno sammartino"
17133,mars is a pretty cool planet . i think i once heard the sunsets are blue . . . the opposite of ours . i wish i could see it !
17134,"it must be a beautiful planet to visit , theres a colonisation project planned for year 2023 , i hope they make it ."
17135,2023 ? that doesn't seem like nearly enough time . i wonder what all the know that we don't realize yet ?
17136,"its a short time but maybe things are almost set up , it most be a really expensive project though , i would sure watch that reality tv show ."
17137,makes me wonder if mars has some time of resource that we will be wanting to extract . . . ?
17138,"im sure there are a lot of valuable minerals and also water we just have to dig deeper , there is a lost satellite on mars i wonder if the reality tv crew can recover it ."
17139,meant type of resource . lol they say it is red from iron . . . i wonder if we need more iron for all the machines we are making to take over the workforce ?
17140,"im not sure but i dont think finding iron is worth it , there must be gold and other valuable minerals in the plant , maybe unknown minerals to men , who knows what can be found there ."
17141,yeah i think iron would be too heavy to take all the way from mars . i wonder if we even can study new bacteria there ?
17142,yeah i bet bateria can be studied and we can find new forms of life for sure even if they are microscopic .
17143,are you a dog or a cat person ? maybe fan of neither of thsoe animals
17144,hello i love dogs . not a huge fan of cats . what about you ?
17145,"i have a dog too so i would say i am a dog person for sure , just love them"
17146,did you know there are 12 different blood types for dogs ?
17147,"i didnt know that , i have to get my dog tested then ,"
17148,"apparently , dogs can donate blood through dog blood drives too ."
17149,"so interesting , you know google also likes dogs , they are a dog company"
17150,i have heard that before . sounds like it would be pretty cool to work for google .
17151,"it must be cool , its a big company , so do you also like astronomy , one of my dreams is to visit mars one day"
17152,it's a very big company . i love astronomy . mars would be cool to see .
17153,"it must , i hear that lichens and cyanobacteria can live in the planet so maybe we can some day"
17154,"very interesting . going back to dogs , did you know istanbul has vending machines that dispense water and food for stray dogs in exchange for plastic bottles ?"
17155,"no i didnt know that , sounds like theres a lot of happy doggies in istanbul , good strategy to keep the streets clean"
17156,very great idea . dogs and elephants are the only animals to understand pointing .
17157,dogs can also see color so they are really smart animals
17158,i always thought they were colorblind .
17159,"no , they can see color just not as much colors as we do ,"
17160,that's very cool . do you like bruno mars ?
17161,"i do like him , i think his a great artist , what about you ?"
17162,i also think he is a great artist with great songs .
17163,"he is , did you know he writes his own music ? but anyway its been great chatting with you , hope we can do it again in the near future ,"
17164,i did not know that . it was great chatting with you as well !
17165,have you seen wonder woman ?
17166,"nope , any good ?"
17167,"me neither , it was high grossing , so a lot of people saw it , i was hoping you were one of them ."
17168,"nah , not my kind of flick . some of the super hero movies are ok , like the batmans with bale were great . but some kind of suck ."
17169,"gal gadot thought she was auditioning for cat woman when she did the first audition for wonder woman , so maybe she is a batman fan ."
17170,interesting . is she the star of the film ?
17171,"yes , she is , there is also chris pine , but i don't think your are a fan of chris pine ."
17172,"interesting , he is the son of the main character from chips the cop show ."
17173,i remember that show in the 80s . what kind of movie do you like ?
17174,"i tend to like dramas , and you ?"
17175,"i like lots of different kinds of movies , like blazing saddles , it is really good , it was nominated for 3 oscars ."
17176,"interesting , is that the one with billy crystal ?"
17177,blazing saddles is a mel brook comedy film in the 70s . the cowboy movie with billy crystal is city slickers and was filmed in the 90s .
17178,"whoops , i don't think i've seen the mel brooks film . is it any good ?"
17179,"oh yeah it is a classic , but it is wacky or absurd style of comedy . if you don't like that style , you will be angry that it got 3 nominations ."
17180,interesting . i don't think those awards mean anything anyways .
17181,"you are kind of right , eminem won more oscars than georges lucas , bill murray and leonardo decaprio combined ."
17182,"this is interesting . what did he win them for , do you know ?"
17183,"he did a movie . maybe he won one for that , but most of them would be for best song ."
17184,interesting . i was wondering if it was for 8 mile . anyways nice chatting with you !
17185,"you too , have a good afternoon ."
17186,hey are you going to watch the academy awards this year ?
17187,probably not . i don't have cable any more . are you ?
17188,"no i don't have cable , and i don't even watch regular tv haha . usually i just check on who won though , are you going to check on that ? you ever watch movies at all"
17189,i don't usually check will probably see the winners on facebook . i like to watch movies and tv shows on hulu or netflix . pretty cool taht the academy awards have been around since 1930 when it was broadcasted on the radio .
17190,"i think that's pretty cool too . and their first tv broadcast was back in 1953 . it's interesting that they are the largest and oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony , i wonder what other countries watch them ? maybe france or something does"
17191,have you seen the latest wonder woman movie ?
17192,"yes i saw that . it took place in world war 1 , which is very unusual setting for movie i think . what did you like about it ? personally i thought it was ok"
17193,"sounds interesting i haven't seen it , but i would like to . gal gadot served two years as a soldier in the israel defense forces , i was surprised to learn ."
17194,"that is interesting . i think that all israeli citizens have to do that though . and yes , that movie is the highest grossing superhero origin movie , and also highest grossing world war one movie . they should make more world war 1 movies i think"
17195,oh i didn't know that about israeli citizens . i agree about making more ww1 movies .
17196,"i guess in 2017 that was the year where are the top three most successful movies were all led by females , that makes sense though , that's the year that star wars and beauty and the beast and wonder woman all came out"
17197,have you seen star wars or beauty and the beast ? i've only seen beauty and the beast .
17198,"i have seen both of those . i really hated the star wars movie . i thought they ruined luke skywalker . and i thought beauty and the beast was ok , i think that they just stole everything from the cartoon version , and it was almost exactly the same , except they made new additions that were not as good , what do you think ?"
17199,i thought it was just okay too . i was kind of disappointed with some of the special effects like the character of lumiere didn't look right to me .
17200,yeah i agree with you he looks weird in the movie . it's funny that gal gadot thought she was testing for the role of catwoman . that is a completely different role lol
17201,"yeah that is not even close , haha ."
17202,"pretty funny how times have changed so in terms of female representation . when she was a member of the justice society , and that was back in 1941 , i guess they made her a secretary lol definitely not an acceptable way to show her nowadays"
17203,yes times have changed for sure . pretty crazy that the sun can produce energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500000 years .
17204,"that is impressive . i wish we could harness that somehow , that would really help save the planet i think . it's all so crazy that the sun is actually white , you're always taught in school that it's yellow , but that's because of our atmosphere"
17205,yeah that is cool . and it is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy .
17206,"it seems small , but the sun is actually huge , the diameter is 110 times the size of earth , that's crazy because the earth is already huge in my opinion haha"
17207,did you know that wonder woman is the top grossing super hero origin movie ? i didn't know that
17208,no . i would have guessed black panther . wonder woman is a dc character which i prefer to marvel .
17209,"see i like batman as my favorite overall superhero , so he is dc , but i can't say i'm a fan of the rest of the dc characters , they seem too unbelievable , who are your favorite dc characters ?"
17210,i grew up with superman comics . such a powerful superhero makes the writers have to come up with preposterous villains though . it is interesting that gal gadot was really a soldier for israel .
17211,"yes that definitely adds more legitimacy to her character , but i do think eveery israeli is required by law to serve in the military , but that still is an interesting fact"
17212,"her first movie was batman , your guy , vs superman , my guy , in 2016 . she signed for 3 movies in her first contract which kept her price low ."
17213,"haha i like that , your guy vs my guy , what did you think of that movie ? i still like christopher reeve as the best superman , superman 1 and 2 are really good movies still , can't say i'm too thrilled with the current superman movies"
17214,it was a watchable movie . i agree with reeve as superman . 2017 was the first year since 1958 that the top 3 grossing domestic films had a female lead .
17215,"ya that is shocking , you mentioned gal gadot , i guess when she auditioned for wonder woman she thought it was originally a try out for catwoman , which would have been a much different movie haha"
17216,"when the character was introduced to the justice league , they made her be the secretary . that would not fly in the climate of political correctness of today ."
17217,"oh no not at all , it's crazy how quickly times change , i also think its crazy that wonder woman was the highest grossing wwi movie , you don't see too many movies based on that war"
17218,that is true . it is also interesting that one of the producers was a chinese company . i suspect that somehow helped the film appear on more screens in china .
17219,"haha yes i defnitely that that factored into it , do you liek daniel daylewis , i can't believe that he won an oscar for best actor 3 times , that is crazy"
17220,he does what he does well . they have been giving oscars since 1929 . this year there will not be a host because of political correctness .
17221,"did they not pick a host now ? i know they changed it from kevin hart or something , i try not to read the news because it is too depressing and exhausting , i like random facts like how a lightening bolt is five times hotter than the surface of the sun haha"
17222,"no . they are going without a host . i cannot conceive of a star one billion times as large as our sun , yet one exists in our galaxy ."
17223,"what is wild too is that the sun makes enough energy in one second to meet our planet's needs for 500 , 000 years , i don't see how we can't capture some of that"
17224,surely future generations will get better at doing that . it is clearly the most important energy source in our solar system .
17225,"yes the future will definitely improve our technology , i think it's wild that the sun is actually white , it's just because of our atmosphere that it appears yellow in the sky"
17226,i agree . i thought it was yellow because it was not as hot as a white star but is hotter than a red one . how about neptune only orbiting the sun once since it was discovered ?
17227,"yes that seems odd , i wonder if we will get to visit any of these distant planets in our lifetime , what do you think ?"
17228,"did you know that dog's have 12 different blood types , and that they can donate blood at blood drives for dogs ?"
17229,no i didnt know that . i love dogs . best kind of helpers there are . very good for the disable . have you any experience with that kind of help from dogs ?
17230,"i have a dog , he's not much of a physical help , but he's emotional support . he keeps me company and always makes me laugh ."
17231,"thants super sweet . i wonder what a dog or any other kind of animal would do on a different plant . lets say mars . i know its a long way , but still fun to think about"
17232,it would be weird if dogs ruled mars . that would be a concept .
17233,very weird . i know the atmosphere has alot to do with it . but still someone got to atleast put it in a movie so we can see it . heard about the 2013 plan for mars ?
17234,yeah i heard that there's a colonization project planned for 2023 that will be funded by creating a reality tv show .
17235,now thats crazy ! they should bring dogs . . . they could make for better tv . dogs are pretty intelligent .
17236,yeah they are . did you know that google prefers dogs to cats ? their code of conduct specifically states that they are a dog company . that makes me want to support them more .
17237,thats so cool to know . i know my dog also kinda acts like me at time . dogs just pick up on our behavior . i do wish they could pick up us talking lol
17238,"my dog is lazy like me , like right now he's just sitting in my chair with me . i wish my dog could talk sometimes just so i could know what he wanted instead of just staring at me ."
17239,"lol same . or if they could sing , when i do play music my dog barks in rhythm . any time i listen to bruno mars he loves it . . . . you like his music ?"
17240,"that's awesome . mine just looks at me weird when i sing . i do like music though , i'm always listening to it ."
17241,i love how he writes some of the best songs . interesting to know he use to be with motown . love that label .
17242,"he's very talented and he writes his own music , that speaks a lot for his talent ."
17243,"he started off as an elvis , which i have seen on youtube . very interesting to see . maye he will go to mars on that reality show lol"
17244,he could be the host of it !
17245,hahah totally ! and play all the music on the planet .
17246,he could wrestle people since he was named after professional wrestler bruno sammartino .
17247,"hahaha that would be entertaining too . dont forget about the dog , it has to be there to trying to sing ad being a helped paw hand lol"
17248,that would be epic ! it was nice chatting with you !
17249,hey there do you like dogs or cats more ? i'm definitely a dogs person
17250,same here ! they are man's best friend !
17251,"yep i agree ! and i never knew that they had 12 different blood types , that's crazy ! i think humans only have like five or six"
17252,isn't that crazy ? dogs can also donate blood at dog blood drives . lol
17253,that's interesting i hope they get a treat afterwards ! i think it's crazy though that only two types of animals can understand human pointing and they are the elephant and the dog
17254,i agree ! i like how google is a dog company and prefers dogs to cats . they even state in their code of conduct that they are a dog company .
17255,"that is pretty cool . i also like what istanbul is doing with their stray dogs , they are training them to pick up garbage and then they will get food once they deliver the garbage to the recycling center"
17256,that's a great idea ! did you know that dogs are not color blind ? they just can't see as many different colors as humans .
17257,"no i didn't know that . i wonder why people say that all the time . on a different note though , do you ever think about the planet mars ? it's the red planet in our solar system"
17258,i do . it's also the fourth planet from the sun and the second smallest planet in the solar system after mercury .
17259,yes you're right . it's also crazy that if you and i were there right now our voices would be higherpitched because of the difference in the atmosphere on mars vs . earth
17260,interesting ! lichens and cyanobacteria would be able to thrive on mars .
17261,"it is interesting . it's also interesting that they are trying to plan a mars colonization project that will be funded by a reality show , i really want to see that !"
17262,that would be fun to watch . a satellite was lost on mars because locheed martin used the imperial system while nasa used the metric system .
17263,"haha that is funny . i remember when that happened . it's also crazy that if we could just travel at one unit of gravity acceleration then we could get to mars in 2 days , i hope we can do that in our lifetime"
17264,that would be awesome ! do you know much about bruno mars ?
17265,in a little bit . i know that he was born in 1985 and is very talented he writes his own music
17266,yes . he was signed and dropped by motown records years before becoming a success .
17267,"well that is cool . and he was also named after a professional wrestler , bruno sammartino"
17268,that is neat ! do you know how bruno mars started out ?
17269,yes i believe he started as an elvis impersonator and didn't even use his original name when he started doing live performances
17270,what do you think about liberal arts degrees ? personally i don't think there is important as engineering degrees
17271,i agree . i dont think they are important as engineering degrees . do you know much about artifical intelligence ?
17272,yeah i know a little bit . apparently there is a nonprofit organization that is constantly trying to advance ai research
17273,yeah and stanford has a class that uses google hangouts to help them teach more efficiently .
17274,yeah that's pretty cool . i think it's scary that facebook is developing an ai though . it would be able to predict users actions and emotions
17275,"that is creepy , i have seen some youtube video on actual ai robots , they are weird ."
17276,"yeah i think a guy is creepy . it's also crazy that there was an ai that scientists created who could beat humans at a puzzle game called 2048 , i don't like that !"
17277,yeah there is a huge theory that way in the future humans will be like pets of ai's or raised in captivity of the ai robots .
17278,"yeah that wouldn't surprise me . it does surprise me though that the actress from the twilight series , kristen stewart , actually authored a paper on artificial intelligence , i did not see that coming lol"
17279,"oh wow , thats cool i guess . i hope she is better at writing ."
17280,"yes , i hope she's good at writing . i don't care for her acting , personally . do you ever read any books by the way ? apparently the fda burned six tons of books at some point in an act of censorship"
17281,wow thats a big statement .
17282,"yeah i think it's scary . i used to read a lot of books but not so much anymore , and i never knew that kissing in a romantic fashion is actually a recent development and was not present in greek literature"
17283,me either ! that is interesting . i would like to see the contest where authors come up with the worst opening sentence .
17284,"yeah i wonder what that would be haha . what do you think about winston churchill by the way ? apparently he won a nobel prize for literature not peace , but i know he was super important during world war ii so i wonder why that is"
17285,"i know he was the prime minister of england and they made a movie about it lol thats awesome , wow nobel prize !"
17286,"yes thats impressive ! i'm shocked that architecture , literature , painting , and music were originally olympic events ! i wonder how they judged that ? it must just be very subjective"
17287,i feel like olympics should be a physical competition . those subjects should be a different event lol
17288,haha yes i agree with you . are using a computer right now ? i know that i am and i find it scary that there are people that would upload their brains to a computer ! what if you got a virus
17289,"wow that is some sci fi stuff , have you ever seen that show black mirror ? well they have an episode on that it was creepy . i would definitely be scared to do something like that ."
17290,"i have seen that show . i do like it , have you heard of the computer that the russians made ? apparently they made it back in 1936 and it can run on water , but anyway take care was a great chat"
17291,winston churchill won a nobel peace prize for in literature not peace .
17292,"huh that is interesting , i like wwii history it's one of my hobbies , he played a very important role in that war"
17293,i wish i had the patience for it . edgar a . poe received 9 for his poem the raven .
17294,"that is too bad that is a great poem , did you know that romantic kissing didn't always exist and is a recent invention"
17295,i did not hard to believe . did you know that there is a poem that when read is depressing but when read backward is inspiring .
17296,"no i din't i want to see that poem , have you heard of the fantasy author terry pratchtt ?"
17297,i haven't but id like to see that poem as well . you know if you publish a book in norway the government will purchase 1000 copies .
17298,"ooof well at least you have guaranteed sales , anyway terry was knighted for his ' services to ligerature ' which is interesting i never heard of him"
17299,me either . there are more libraries in the us than there are micky d's
17300,"well that is good at least , did you know there is a professor that teaches heavy metal as a form of literature , don't know that . i don't like that and i like heavy metal"
17301,not me so much anymore . did you know the fda burn 6 tons of literature as an act of censorship .
17302,"no i didn't , do you know why they burned the books ? that seems really weird"
17303,they were trying to censor something they did not want to get out i'm assuming .
17304,"ah i see , what i do think is crazy is that art , music , and poetry were olympic sports back in the day"
17305,poetry has a history dating back to prehistorical times . creations like hunting poetry in africa
17306,"that is crazy , and apparently the vikings were warriorpoets , they killed people and also wrote poetry"
17307,javanese alphabet when recited in order forms a poem
17308,"interesting i wonder what it says , do you liek tupac ? apparently he studied poetry in school"
17309,i was a big fan in my younger years . i do believe he prided himself on being a poet .
17310,"ya i think so , i never listened to his music personally , i did watch lord of the rings and apparently tolkien would laugh at bad poetry with his friends"
17311,"interesting . well it was nice talking with you , enjoy the rest of the day ."
17312,"great you too , make sure to check out some poetry like the 274 line poem called ' the chaos '"
17313,i love to read especially fiction . do you feel the same ?
17314,"i am an avid reader , most of mine is in non fiction , but i occasionally dabble in the fiction realm"
17315,did you know that romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and it is rarely mentioned in old literature ?
17316,"no , i kind of expected that to be a thing that has been around for a while , in the literature realm at least"
17317,me too . i wonder why it was not really a practice a long time ago . how do you feel about censorship in literature ?
17318,"i think it is horrible , especially the burning of literature . such a waste"
17319,"i agree , i am totally against censorship . the fda burned six tons of literature in an act of censorship in the us . that's devastating to me ."
17320,"i agree , especially for something that actually was once an onlympic event , you think it would be valued more"
17321,literature was an olympic event ? ! that's so strange . i don't even know how that would work .
17322,"along with music , sculpture , painting and architecture in both 1912 and 1932 . im not sure how you compete in those , but im all for the arts"
17323,i'm for it to but im also curious how you would compete . did you know that poe only received 9 for the publication of the raven ? that's so sad that his genius was not credited until after his death .
17324,"that must have been frustrating for him . he is such an iconic poet now , too bad his talent wasn't recognized when he was alive ."
17325,i agree . did you know that churchill won a nobel prize for literature but not one for peace ?
17326,"i always thought his prize was for peace , that is really interesting ."
17327,it is very unexpected . i don't get there much anymore but i used to go to the library a lot . how about you ?
17328,"i havent been in forever . i usually just buy books now , i really should go back and check it out . i think it is cool that sacramento has a library of things that people can check out that they need briefly but not long term ."
17329,that is an amazing idea . i wish i had access to a place like that . i am very glad that there are still more libraries in the us than mcdonald's . we need to keep libraries protected .
17330,"we really do , we need support for literature too like in norway where if you publish a book , the government will buy 1000 copies to put them in libraries ."
17331,that's a fantastic idea also . it's good for the writer and the library . i am also glad that half of adults still have library cards . i actually just went and got mine renewed yesterday . you can do so much with them now . mine even has audiobooks you can access online .
17332,really ? i should definitely check in to that . that would be cheaper than using audible . i remember in college using the mircoform machines to read articles .
17333,way cheaper . i've never actually used one of those machines but i know we used to have them .
17334,"what do you think is a more important degree , liberal arts or engineering ?"
17335,"i think both have their place . i'm a science person myself , with a degree in chemistry , but i can totally appreciate studying more artistic things . how about you ?"
17336,"yes i have an engineering degree , personally i think engineering is much more important than liberal arts , anyone can learn a liberal arts degree but that's just my opinion ."
17337,"yeah i agree that engineering is far more complex , but i still think that liberal arts are important . maybe not to get a job , so it might be a waste of money to pursue that kind of degree , but the subject itself is worthwhile in my opinion . do you know much about ai ?"
17338,i know a little bit about it . i think there is a nonprofit organization actually that is responsible for promoting development of artificial intelligence
17339,that's really cool ! i read that facebook is developing an artificial intelligence that can understand human emotions and predict behavior . kind of crazy !
17340,"wow that is crazy ! i like stanford's idea though , they are using artificial intelligence to help to teach students more efficiently with google hangouts"
17341,i think that's great ! it makes classes so much more accessible to people . did you know kristen stewart coauthored an artificial intelligence paper ? i wonder how that turned out . . .
17342,"wow i didn't know that was interested in artificial intelligence , did you know that artificial intelligence can crush all human records in puzzlesolving"
17343,"yeah i read that they beat all of the records for the game ' 2048 ' , but i'm not familiar with that game are you ?"
17344,"no i've never played that game before , but it sounds very complex , do you read any books on artificial intelligence by the way"
17345,i never have ! honestly its not something i know much about . have you read on the subject ?
17346,"no i haven't read about artificial intelligence but i do you like to read on occasion , i even found out recently that romantic kissing is a recent invention and that they did not kiss each other back in the ancient greeks time"
17347,i read that to ! i also enjoy reading apparently literature used to be an olympic event . i wonder how that worked ?
17348,"it is a great question , it's also a real question on why the fda burned six tons of literature , that sounds like censorship to me"
17349,"thats an insane amount of censorship , do you know when that happened ?"
17350,"no i don't know when or why but it sounds very dubious to me , what do you think about winston churchill winning the nobel peace prize ?"
17351,i was really surprised to find that he won for literature and not peace ! did you know that there is a contest every year where writers compete to come up with the worst opening sentence to a novel ?
17352,"no i've never heard about that , do they use computers when they're writing ? apparently there are people called transhumanists how to upload their souls into computers"
17353,. . . no way ? that's insane ! i've never heard of that before . i wonder how they think they'll do that ? i think i remember seeing a johnny depp movie where he did something like that lol
17354,"yeah i think i saw that movie too , i also want to see a movie about the russian computer that runs on water , they invented it back in 1936"
17355,"hi , do you ever get a chance to go to the library ?"
17356,"i do on occasion . i really want to check out that library in sacramento that allows patrons to check out more than just books , stuff that's useful but also stuff we don't want to own in the long run . what about you ?"
17357,a tool library is a great idea . it makes life so much easier for people that can't afford some basic tools . i don't usually get to the library much . i do research online .
17358,i understand ! but luckily there are more libraries than there are mcdonald's here in the united states ! plus half the adult population owns library cards ! that gives me a little hope ! ha !
17359,"if they could combine the two , it would be great ! get some books for the mind , and food for the big belly ! a happy combo !"
17360,"that is a great idea ! ha ! never considered that ! so are you also a fan of poetry by chance ? i personally love that one poem that is depressing when you read it , but inspiring when you read it backwards !"
17361,i never heard of that poem . i guess it must be famous . never read it in school . i wonder who wrote it . i don't know much about poetry .
17362,"it's very interesting . i highly recommend it to you ! if you're a fan of the hobbit , nearly if the character names were taken from an icelandic poem called dvergatal ."
17363,"tolkien loved language , so i'm not surprised that he took names from obscure sources . he wrote the lotr series because he could create languages for the different races ."
17364,"that's pretty interesting ! hey , even the javanese alphabet actually forms a poem when it's recited in order ! that is amazing !"
17365,"i guess it's not like the abc song , which is just letters . language is fascinating . i'm shocked that edgar allan poe only received 9 for the publication of his poem , ' the raven . '"
17366,that is shocking considering how legendary it is today . he was ripped off ! wonder if demetri martin received much for the 224 word palindrome poem he wrote ?
17367,a palindrome that long must have taken years to write . how did he do it ? did he win an award ? i hope so .
17368,"i hope so as well ! but all in all , i'm a fan of literature in general . it's crazy to think winston churchill won a nobel prize for literature and not peace back in 1953 ."
17369,i would expect churchill to have won for something else like peace because he tried so hard to end war and help the world . i guess he wrote a good memoir or something ? i don't know .
17370,i suppose so but you do make a great point there ! can you also believe the fda once burned six tons of literature in an act of us censorship ? that is unbelievable and ridiculous !
17371,i guess they thought they were helping the country and its morality . silly . too many books get banned . i think it's part of freedom of speech to read what you want .
17372,"exactly ! heck , even literature along with architecture , painting , music , etc . were all olympic events up until 1952 !"
17373,"i find that strange . how are those things athletic ? there should be contests , but in a different arena . not sports ."
17374,"i suppose that's why they got rid of them . but in a humorous note , there's actually a contest that challenges writers to come up with horrible opening sentences for novels . i'd love to see some of the examples . ha !"
17375,"ah , yes , i've heard of that contest . ' it was a dark and stormy night . ' yes , lots of fun . anyway , it was fun chatting !"
17376,ha ! can't imagine what it would have been like without romantic kissing since it's a fairly new development and is hardly found in ancient greek literature ! it was great chatting with you as well . take care !
17377,are you into artificial intelligence ?
17378,"not really . it's interesting , though . are you ?"
17379,i love it . a lot of people are afraid that it may take over and take jobs away .
17380,"yeah , people are afraid for sure . personally , i think it could only make the world better"
17381,it is already making a huge impact on everyday life by helping us do things we do everyday like communicate
17382,no doubt . as time goes by it can do many things for us . robo farmers are coming in britain
17383,that will be extremely beneficial to the world . automated cars will be of great value too
17384,i totally agree . human drivers are dangerous ! no more drunk driving . no more texting and driving ! imagine all the lives that will be saved .
17385,the car i have now is essentially automated
17386,"awesome ! ai could allow people to focus on things that a machine could never do . like being creative , for instance"
17387,ai is even present in medicine now days . some surgeries can be done with the assistance of ai and doctor supervision
17388,"a machine will not accidently leave something in a patient . machines have no empathy , so the doctor's role will not go away"
17389,i think you are right . i am curious to see how art and music integrate ai
17390,"yeah , no doubt . ai may assist with the recording of music , replacing the sound engineer maybe . it'll be interesting to see"
17391,many of the large tech executives have degrees in humanities and english and not science like you might think
17392,that actually does not surprise me . those subjects can help you gain insight that engineering can't . i think both are important to study
17393,as computers have advanced so to has ai .
17394,i didn't know that a woman wrote the first algorithm .
17395,pretty amazing for sure . the space shuttle runs off of a relatively small computer and the russians have one that runs on water
17396,"kristen stewart cowrote an paper about ai , i had no idea"
17397,one of the first published papers i believe .
17398,hello . do you know much about ai ?
17399,"not much , terminator taught me to be fearful of ai !"
17400,i am not sure what i think of machines mimicking humans . makes me nervous !
17401,"a machine learning and problem solving is scary , and they keep getting smarter ."
17402,i know . honestly the idea of autonomous operating cars scares me most .
17403,even scarier than self driving cars is the fact that actress kristen stewart coauthored a paper on ai .
17404,"funny . i guess facebook is also getting in on the action by developing an ai that understands emotions , predicts actions , and identifies objects in photos ."
17405,"i wonder what the purpose of that is . ai just crushes human intelligence , in the game 2048 it beat the game in only 973 moves ."
17406,not sure but there is a non profit organization that is working on more advancement of ai .
17407,stanford uses google plus hangouts to help teach artificial intelligence class .
17408,i think i will stick to computers for now .
17409,"we are very lucky to have computers , devices that carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations ."
17410,it's cool that someone built a computer using nothing but minecraft building blocks
17411,"i want to know where the water run computer is , russians made one in 1936 ."
17412,there are so many programs nowadays too for computers .
17413,"and then you have the people that want to upload their consciousness to computers , wonder if that essentially makes them a program ."
17414,"probably , sounds insane to me . also insane to think that if you smoke near an apple computer you void the warranty ."
17415,"yes , wonder what makes it a biohazard after that . all those old engineers and programmers used to smoke like chimneys ."
17416,no doubt ! did you know the space shuttle's regular computer runs on only 1mb of ram .
17417,"that seems impossible , so much has to be ran on that computer ."
17418,"i know , right ? nice chat !"
17419,have a good night !
17420,"hi , do you enjoy reading ?"
17421,"hello there , i do , how about yourself ?"
17422,yes me too . did you know the fda once burned 6 tons of books ?
17423,"no i never heard that before , that is very interesting though ."
17424,yeah and sad to be honest
17425,"yeah it is . on a different subject , did you know that terry pratchett was knighted ?"
17426,did not know that . did you know literature was an olympic sport ?
17427,"what , that doesn't sound like that sport at all , but whatever they want to do i guess ."
17428,"well , it no longer is but i would have liked to see what that involved"
17429,yeah it must have been something pretty amazing to be included if you ask me .
17430,yeah for sure . did you know churchill won a nobel prize ?
17431,"no i didn't know that , do you know what he won it for ?"
17432,yeah for literature . i guess he was smart all around
17433,"that's pretty cool , i think we need more leaders here who are very smart ."
17434,yeah i agree with that . do you like poetry ?
17435,"i do enjoy some good poetry , do you ? and did you know vikings were considered poets ?"
17436,did not know that . have you heard about the japanese alphabet ?
17437,"no i haven't , what is that about ?"
17438,if you read it in order it forms a poem
17439,"oh ok , ill have to check one out one day soon here ."
17440,sounds cool . do you know where the characters for the movie the hobbit were taken from ?
17441,"well they were all taken from the series of books , those are so good . well it was nice talking with you , i hope you have a good night ."
17442,do you wear a costume on halloween ?
17443,"yes , only on one day a year though . i am not like those celebrities that can wear whatever they want any day of the year . i love the kardashians though ."
17444,"heidi klum and her boyfriend dressed as fiona and shrek . she had people work on her prosthetics , hair and makeup . this took hours ."
17445,how cute and yeah i bet it would take a team of people to make heidi klum look ugly . she is a supermodel .
17446,you said you like the kardashians . they dressed up as the victoria's secret angels . the lingerie company even gave them the wings .
17447,"oh wow , that sounds about right . they are so elaborate all of the time . i thnk beyonce is funny , she dressed up at phoni braxton , rather than toni braxton , punny ."
17448,olive munn posted costumes of her dresseing up as people whom she admires . that's pretty cool .
17449,"aww , that's sweet . i think justin timberlake is kind of sneaky because he dressed up like the lego batman and was able to conceal his complete identity . he would walk around with his kids unnoticed ."
17450,"yeah , that is cool he got to go trick or treating with them ."
17451,"i like how some celebrities , like johnny depp , use his costume to make surprise visits to hospitals to see sick kids . he wears his jack sparrow sometimes ."
17452,that is so cool ! i'd love to see panda researchers in action though since they dress up as pandas .
17453,i know i would love to see that ! what a great work environment and atmosphere . how fun would that be . i have heard that some costumes have been lost in in transit when flying too .
17454,johnny depp would probably be upset if that happened to him . he travels with his jack sparrowcostume to make impromptu visits to sick kids in hospitals
17455,"yeah , he is a sweet guy . i was just watching judge judy and she isn't so sweet . but she makes a ton of money per episode i have heard ."
17456,she is the highest paid celebrity after lebron james
17457,"dang , thats crazy . do you know how much she makes ?"
17458,"123 , 000 per episode . that is pretty sweet ! i wonder if she has been to the secret pixar room for celebrities ."
17459,"oh , that is a big pay day ."
17460,do you like celebrity chefs ? there is one who believes he can combat hunger .
17461,"yes , they are great . i have to go watch sesame street with my kids . did you carol burnett was the first celebrity to appears on there ?"
17462,"i didn't know that . i guess celebrity voices in cartoon is a fairly recent thing . robin williams was the first to start the trend , in the movie aladdin ."
17463,hi there ! what are you up to tonight ? i'm hanging out watching tv .
17464,"hi ! i love to watch tv ! especially horror films . in fact , i found out recently that et was actually scripted to be a horror film . can you imagine what a scary et would have been like ?"
17465,i thought et was freaky enough ! did you know stephen king was terrified as a kid when he saw the movie bambi ?
17466,"he was terrified of bambi ? goodness he must truly have a twisted view on things . ha ! meanwhile , apparently not a single person on the exorcist crew thought it would be considered a horror movie during filming . what is wrong with people ? ha !"
17467,"right ! i don't get that at all . i mean , that movie was just gross ."
17468,agreed ! it certainly was . so did you ever see inception ? chris nolan actually wanted it to be a horror film initially but it evolved into a heist film instead . wonder what that would have been like ?
17469,"no , i do not think i am familiar with that one . it's hard to believe horror has existed as a genre for more than a century !"
17470,"indeed ! i also think it's cool that horror was inspired by legendary authors like bram strokes , edgar allan poe and mary shelley !"
17471,i really liked edgar allen poe movies !
17472,his literature was amazing . did you also know the original scream movie was going to be titled scary movie initially ? i kind of like scream better !
17473,"oh , yeah that would really change things up a lot ! did you know the water phone is the instrument that is used in horror films to make creepy music ."
17474,"i didn't know that but always wondered how they make that noise ! on a lighter note , i think it's funny the dad's voice on phineas and ferb was the rocky horror picture show writer !"
17475,was he really ? i really love that show ! we watched it all the time when my kids were younger .
17476,"it was a great show , wasn't it ? so do you also watch the academy awards ? i always wish i could have seen the oscar walt disney won back in 1938 for snow white . the oscar he received was special because it had seven miniature statues along with a regular sized statuette ! that's hilarious !"
17477,"yes , it certainly was ! i get the award shows confused . i know the 90th aa were in 2017 though ."
17478,did you also know only walt disney has been nominated for more oscars than john williams ?
17479,"no , i did not know that . i can imagine why walt had so many though . what a great imagination brought to life !"
17480,"that is so true ! i also think lady gaga has a great imagination as well ! speaking of lady gaga , did you know she was actually on the mtv show boiling point before she became famous ?"
17481,"no , i'll have to look that up . it's hard to believe her and bradley cooper remade a star is born only because it is 80 years old ."
17482,"i know , right ? i think it was sweet of her to buy 1000 worth of pizzas for her fans waiting in line for her one time . i wish more celebs could be like her ."
17483,aww . that was sweet ! nice chatting with you .
17484,"i think it's even sweeter her stage name came from the song radio ga ga by queen ! well , it was nice chatting with you as well ! have a great evening , friend !"
17485,"okay , bye"
17486,do you like lady gaga ?
17487,i do . do you know her full name ?
17488,her name is stefani joanne angelina germanotta
17489,yeah . do you know how she got the name lady gaga ?
17490,yes that was a predictive tect glitch for radio to lady
17491,yeah . did you know she once worked with the lapd ?
17492,yes she notified them of road work .
17493,yeah . she is the godmother of elton john's child
17494,nice . her favorite band is iron maiden
17495,and she was on boiling points before she was famous
17496,"yes that was on mtv , i remember that"
17497,yeah . do you watch the academy awards ?
17498,sometimes . did you know day lewis has won it three time ?
17499,"yes and for the same category , best actor , wow"
17500,i know . blazzing saddles was also nominated for three oscars
17501,yeah . eminem has more oscars under his name than leo di caprio
17502,yes and more than johnny depp and george lucas and some other big names
17503,crazy . it was nice chatting with you
17504,"i know but good for him , he is a great artist . yes have a good one"
17505,"yes , and forgot to mention bill murray and will smith in there"
17506,yeah and these are all combined . awesome . have a good one
17507,who is the male star in the latest ' a star is born ' ?
17508,bradley cooper . apparently there have been 3 other versions before this one . i didnt know that
17509,interesting . do you know when the first was made ?
17510,1937 . and who was the leading lady ?
17511,"wow , that's a long time ago . i think i heard janet gaynor was the name of the starlet ."
17512,correct ! and barbra streisand was the last leading lady . im sure she did an excellent job also .
17513,"she always does a good job , but didn't lady gaga star in the latest version ?"
17514,yes i meant the last leading lady before lady gaga . sorry . im surprised lady gaga was such a hit considering shes fairly new to acting
17515,"the middle one starred judy garland , only a few years after the wizard of oz ."
17516,so lots of amazing female singers . i was mistaken apparently lady gaga acted in school plays and went to a school for the arts . so maybe acting isnt so new to her just new to us
17517,cool . what is gaga's real name ? i know she was born in 1986 .
17518,stefani
17519,ok . do you know her full name ? i think joanne is one of her middle names .
17520,and angelini . she must be a true italian with all the names lol
17521,i know she studied music too . do you know where ?
17522,new york university . did you hear that she once bought 1000 worth of pizza for fans
17523,"well , when you have 11 . 4 million twitter followers , you have to keep them happy !"
17524,thats insane . can you imagine so many people adoring you ? its pretty impressive that her first big picture is up for an oscar
17525,she is young enough that she might compete with daniel daylewis and his record 3 wins !
17526,"and yet people like brad pitt , harrison ford and johnny depp have never won an oscar thats impressive for her part ."
17527,eminem has more oscars than george lucas . crazy !
17528,i was just thinking that lol . and george lucas's wife won an oscar for star wars editing and he didnt win any and its probably the most praised series of all times
17529,"well , walt disney holds 22 ! anyway , thanks for the chat !"
17530,"hello , who is your favorite celebrity ?"
17531,"i love demi lovato a lot , and i loved mac miller , rip , . they seem , ed , pretty nice but some can be pretty flashy , like heidi klum . did you know she dressed up as princess fiona from shrek ?"
17532,really ? i did not know that ! kim kardashian was in a music video from fall out boy !
17533,that's so cool . she actually was paris hilton's personal assistant before she got famous and was her stylist . do you like kim kardashian ?
17534,"no , i am not the biggest fan of her although i do check up on her social media from time to time . what about you ?"
17535,i don't really like her . i'm not quite sure why she's famous . she has a big social media presence though .
17536,that is true . kim has a book regarding why she is 'a trailblazer of the selfie movement' .
17537,"yeah , i've heard of it , it's all just selfies of her ! did you see that she was recently dethroned as the mostliked photo on instagram ? it was by a picture of an egg . literally , a plain egg ."
17538,"ah , that beautiful egg . i liked that photo a total of three times on my three different instagram accounts . how many times did you like it ?"
17539,"i actually do not have instagram , i think it can be pretty addicting and toxic for some people , and i think i'm one of those people . i love that photo though !"
17540,"i am glad someone decided to do that , i mean it was about time that someone else held the crown of most liked photo on instagram !"
17541,"i agree ! it's time to put kim in her place haha . and her husband , too : i think kanye used to be great but now i don't know . . ."
17542,"yep , his popularity has definitely taken a hit . pixar apparently has a secret room that is often visited by celebrities !"
17543,"that's so cool ! i wonder what they do there . speaking of pixar , did you know robin williams was the first celebrity to do a voice over in an animated film ? disney owns pixar , in case you didn't know ."
17544,disney owns a lot of things . don't you think that it would be much cheaper to hire a nobody to do voiceovers rather than a celebrity ?
17545,"yes i agree ! but honestly , one of the only reasons i watched boss baby was because it had alec baldwin in it . . . maybe that idea works !"
17546,"possibly . hiring celebrities are not cheap . judge judy earns 123 , 000 per episode !"
17547,that's so shocking ! i heard the cast of friends made 1 million per episode at the very end ! isn't that insane ?
17548,that is a lot of money for one episode ! carol burnett was the very first celebrity to appear on sesame street !
17549,"that's so cool . there have been so many after that . lindsay lohan , jason derulo , will arnett , backstreet boys !"
17550,"ah , that brings back memories . you liked the backstreet boys too didn't you ?"
17551,"i did ! i still do , they're great . what a great band !"
17552,do you like costumes ?
17553,i love them . do you know what bob denver did for his make a wish for the kids ?
17554,"i have no idea , was it something fun ?"
17555,yes it was he allowed them to rescue him from an island with him on a gilligan costume
17556,wow that is so cool . did you know that panda researchers wear panda costumes ?
17557,that is pretty cool . did you know that there is someone else named justin bieber ?
17558,really and is he a singer too by any chance ?
17559,no but he was banned from facebook just because of the name
17560,wow that is too much . did you know pixar has a secret room ?
17561,"really , what is in there ?"
17562,"actually i do not know , you have to be a celebrity to get in there"
17563,i see . do you know who holds the record for most granted makeawish ?
17564,i am not sure of that but do you know who is the highest paid celebrity ?
17565,"i do not know , who is it ? it is john cena with the most wishes granted"
17566,wow that is awesome . it is lebron james as the most paid
17567,wow did not know he is making that much money now .
17568,yes he makes more than judge judy and she makes 123 000 per episode
17569,wow nice . paris hilton is the most overrated celebrity
17570,no way . did you know that robin williams was the voice of aladdin ?
17571,that is pretty awesome . nice chat
17572,same here have a good one
17573,do you like to wear costumes ?
17574,"i like coming up with costumes for halloween and wearing them on that day , or whenever the halloween parties are , , but i don't get super wild about it like heidi klum or beyonce or celebs like that . i keep it a little more low key . what about you ?"
17575,"i love costumes as well , halloween is one of my favorite days in the year , panda research wear costumes everyday , panda costumes"
17576,"yea i think that's hilarious . i'm sure it's to keep the actual pandas calm or whatever , but it seems so silly , sipping your coffee on the way into the office . . . wearing a panda costume ."
17577,"i guess its part of a normal routine to them , johny depp also likes to wear costumes to cheer kids in hospitals"
17578,"that's really sweet when celebrities do stuff like that . depp is not my fav , but i give him credit for that . i also like it when celebs like justin timberlake get so dressed up they aren't recognizable and mingle in with normal folks who have no idea the celeb is there ."
17579,"ive seen some sketches , one of maroon 5 they were in disguise and started playing then people realized it was them and the crowd grew at an accelerated rate"
17580,"it's like costumes play an important role in society . . . as in , they can be a cultural thing , but also a way to connect to others . i think one of my favorite instances of this is when kyrie irving the basketball player dressed up as an old man and went to a public court to play . he schooled everyone and it was really funny ."
17581,"i didnt hear about that one but it does sound funny lol , do you know who kim kardashian is ?"
17582,"yes , i do . i don't really pay attention to her , though i was happy to learn she's advocating for victims of armenian genocide . what do you think about her ?"
17583,"i think she's had a lot of controversies over the years ,"
17584,"yea i think she's beautiful , but in that l . a . wealthyplastic surgery kind of way that isn't so great . did you ever watch her reality show ? i watched parts of an episode or two , but i mostly avoided it ."
17585,"i did , i didn't really like it i think she gives a terrible example to teens"
17586,"yea , i remember the ray j thing . i wonder if that was a coordinated publicity stunt , or if she just turned it in her favor , or if it was actually a traumatic thing for her but people ended up paying more attention to her anyway ? in any case , the whole thing was less than wholesome . . ."
17587,"celebrities tend to bring a lot of drama to our lifes , they earn a lot of money too just like judge judy , she makes about 123000 per episode"
17588,yea she's paid a lot to get into people's faces a bit ! i can't believe she's second to lebron james as far as her income goes . i'd like to see them play 1on1 on the court though .
17589,"that would be interesting indeed , lebron has an unfair advantage though , did you hear about pixars secret room ?"
17590,i did ! i wonder what's so secret about it ? i know that pixar often includes the number ' a113 ' in their movies because it's a reference to the original office they did their work in or something . do you have a favorite pixar movie ?
17591,"not really or can be , i just cant recall one right now , was aladdin a pixar movie ? robie williams nailed it by performing aladdins voice"
17592,"i don't think that was , i think it was a disney movie before they bought pixar . that was a nice movie , and robin williams was great . i heard will smith is going to play that same role , and apparently people are up in arms about that . not sure why though ."
17593,"i hope will smith is up for the role , he is a great actor but robin williams was just great , sad how things ended for him thoughh"
17594,do you like computers ?
17595,"i love my laptop , i can't leave home without it . how about you"
17596,me too . did you know the space shuttle only runs on 1mb of ram ?
17597,"i did not know that ! is that a lot or a little , i never know size"
17598,that is not a lot . i think my computer might have more .
17599,"ha nice , i am sure mine does too , it is rather new . did you know captcha is an anagram ?"
17600,"no , i didn't know that . did you know you could build a 16 bit computer using minecraft building blocks ?"
17601,"ha wow i did not know that , i will have to try it out . i will have to read about it , do you read much ?"
17602,i read a little bit . what about transhumanists ?
17603,"what is that , i never heard of transhumanists ?"
17604,it is when you upload your mind to a computer and memory sticks .
17605,"ha wow , that is some interesting science ! i like reading about romantic kissing sometimes , that didn't exist in ancient greece"
17606,interesting . i didn't know that . did you know kim jun un has a degree in phsyics ?
17607,i wonder where he got it from lol . the university of kim jung un ? lol
17608,"i think they sent him abroad when he was younger , but i'm not sure ."
17609,i think you're right . if i remember right it was switzerland or something . i like learning about physics . do you ?
17610,"interesting . no , i'm not a physics fan . but i know that chinese dye may lead to breakthroughs in quantum physics ."
17611,i remember i got to go to an amusement park in high school because of physics . i defintely didn't study quantum physics or help the cause
17612,did you know smoking near an apple computer voids its warranty ?
17613,"ha no way , i am sure it discolors it also ! did you know windows 95 was second most downloaded software after the game doom , interesting ."
17614,i can believe it . that game was popular . nice chatting with you .
17615,"hello , do you enjoy reading literature ?"
17616,"yes , sometimes . i would have liked to have seen what the fda burned ."
17617,i know isn't that terrible ! did you know winston churchill won a nobel prize for literature ?
17618,i did not . i knew he had the ' gift of gab ' but not writing . i can't believe that romantic kissing is a recent development and the ancient greeks didn't reference it much . i thought they were a bit more amorous than that .
17619,"lol , what ? really , i did too . that surprises me . would that be for religious reasons ?"
17620,i don't think so . have you seen their fullfrontal sculptures ?
17621,"yes , i have . did you know the olympics use to have sculpture as an event from 1912 to 1952 ?"
17622,"yes , along with architecture and other things . wild that there is an annual literature contest for writers for who can write the worst possible opening sentence to a novel . i may be able to win that . . ."
17623,"lol , really , that would be interesting ! ! at least that is something different !"
17624,"wow , i read recently that the russians built a computer in 1936 that ran of water !"
17625,"wow , that's really inventive ! i would like to see that . gosh , don't get any smoke near your apple computer it voids the warranty !"
17626,i heard of that . crazy that they think it would become a biohazard .
17627,"ha , ha , ha ! ! i know . . . . . i wonder if candle smoke would do the same ?"
17628,they would have other ' environmental ' concerns over that . interesting that ' transhumanists ' want to upload their minds to memory devices . does that mean that stupid people would require a smaller thumbdrive ?
17629,"lol , could be . especially if they don't have good memory !"
17630,kim jongun has a degree in physics ?
17631,"i was thinking the same thing , or just gave it to him . you have to have a smart mind for that ! ! lol omg can you believe pixar spent 3 years studying the physics of curly hair for the movie brave ?"
17632,now that's some dumb research . . . did you hear that there is some uppity hs in scarsdale ny that thinks ap classes aren't good enough so they developed their own ?
17633,yeah ! its the only public school in the country that has dropped it . crazy !
17634,"yes , and many were afraid other schools would follow but they didn't ."
17635,"i know , they wanted their own homegrown college level courses ! ! good chat ! !"
17636,"yeah , 30 percent were kept out and it wouldn't be standardize so . . . stupid . yes , thanks , you were great !"
17637,hey there . did you take any ap classes in high school ? cuz i hear they're replacing them in some schools now .
17638,"i took a few . . . i think . it's been so long since high school it's hard to remember . ha ! yeah , i think i heard about that , they're replacing them with at courses . . . dunno , might be a good idea , what do you think ?"
17639,it seems like they'd work in private and prestigious schools like georgetown day is doing . but i don't think they'd work out in general . how about you ?
17640,"i really don't know , i think it depends on the quality of the teachers and the dedication of the students . some people say with the right teacher , a mediocre student can really shine , but with some students . . . , shrugs ,"
17641,you do have a point there . i've heard that at teachers have great reputations so far . so your optimism may be justified haha .
17642,"yeah , i heard one of the courses they offered was in computer technology . speaking of computers , did you know the russians made a computer that ran on water ?"
17643,"what ? really ? that's insane ! but then again i work on designing quantum computers so i've seen some weird stuff myself haha . physics is weird in general , don't you think ?"
17644,"you work on quantum computers ? ? for real ? that is awesome ! but yeah , physics is pretty weird . i'm told kim jongun has a degree in physics . i wonder if it's earned or ' honorary ' . . ."
17645,"oh he earned it , just like how he invented basketball ! i wonder if they'll offer any quantum computing courses through ap or at in the future . do you think highschoolers would like writing 15 page research papers for that like they do for at already ?"
17646,"depends on the high school student , i guess . i couldn't really see writing 15 pages on about anything these days . lol . speaking of physics , they say pixar studied the physics of curly hair for three years . can you believe it ?"
17647,"oh i believe it , that stuff gets real complicated real fast . solving complicated partial differential equations should be an olympic sport , just like literature and music once were !"
17648,"i heard one guy got a degree in theoretical physics when he was only 20 years old . now , that's gotta be one smart fella !"
17649,indeed my dude . how many ap tests do you think he took ? do you think they'd ever exclude him from at classes like that school in scarsdale does ?
17650,no idea . i have a better question . . . do you think he'd want to be a transhumanist and upload his brain into a computer ? that would be pretty wild !
17651,i know i would ! hopefully my research can help make that a reality one day . then i'll upload your brain too !
17652,hmm . . dunno if i'd want my brain uploaded . sounds a bit on the creepy side . . . i know we couldn't do it on a space shuttle computer though . it only has 1mb of ram ! can you believe it ?
17653,"crazy how much computers have evolved , huh ? now your smartphone can download the entire history of western literature and still have space to spare !"
17654,literature is another neat subject . . did you know there's an annual challenge for writers to com up with the worst possible opening to a novel ? i find that hilarious !
17655,that sounds like fun to me haha . do you think kissing will ever be phased out of literature ? i know that's only a modern thing .
17656,"no , i think it's pretty much here to stay , as long as there's romance novels , which don't seem to be slowing down anytime soon . ,"
17657,"ah , that's too bad haha . but unlike romance novels , i can't stay myself . but i had nice chat and i hope you have a nice day . goodbye !"
17658,did you know that the fda has burned six tons of literature in the sake of us censorship ?
17659,do we know what theme had those books ?
17660,i'm not sure . but there is an annual literature contest for literature with the worst opening sentences
17661,"now thats something i would love to see an example of ! ; ,"
17662,"interestingly , the space shuttle's general purpose computer only ran on 1mb of ram"
17663,to do what . . . keep the txt files ?
17664,"i don't know , but doesn't sound like a lot of memory . in 1936 russians made a computer that ran on water . i wish i could do that if i could save money and recycle the water ."
17665,"ran on water . . . was it like a cyborg jesus ? : ,"
17666,don't smoke near an apple computer or it will void the warranty making it a biohazard
17667,"i don't believe that . . . how would they know ? : ,"
17668,maybe the smell ?
17669,"what , when you go to the service depot , they can smell if somebody was smoking close to it ? ; ,"
17670,"somebody made up the rule , so there has to be some test : , pixar spent three years studying physics of curly hair to correctly render merida's hair in ' brave '"
17671,"now that's interesting . i wonder if that research helped creating nvidia hairworks technology : ,"
17672,could be ! they think that an ancient chinese dye used on the terra cotta army may lead to quantum physics breakthroughs . wonder how ?
17673,terra cotta army ? what is that ?
17674,i believe that was the large statue army that was uncovered in china . you can look it up it is amazing !
17675,what . . . how does this has anything to do with quantum physics . . .
17676,"i have no idea , but the statue army is really really cool looking and a great archaeological find . people think the universe could have come from nothing without violating physics . don't quite understand that either ."
17677,come from nothing ? in physics nothing comes from nothing . . .
17678,i don't even know what that implies nothing from nothing . in 1953 sir winston churchill won a nobel prize in literature not peace
17679,"he fought for the peace : , it's kind of a paradox : , lol , maybe that's why : ,"
17680,"could be . interestingly architecture , literature , music , painting and sculpture were olympic events from 1912 to 1952 ."
17681,"i love apple products , and was surprised to learn that smoking near them violates the warranty , as it is supspodedly a ' bio hazard '"
17682,captcha is an acronym for ' completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart '
17683,"yes , i knew this . i like ' captcha ' better . what do you think of those people who want to upload their minds to computers ?"
17684,i think they are losing their minds . . . ha !
17685,just like the person who built a working computer out of minecraft building blocks . that was weird too .
17686,yeah . he really has something to build on though . . . the first google computer at stanford was housed in custommade enclosures constructed from lego bricks
17687,"that's crazy . then again , the russians made one that ran on water , back in 1936"
17688,the first computer algorithm was written by a woman named ada lovelace . might not be nominated but they got the algorithm . . .
17689,i recently found out that literature and painting were once olympic events .
17690,i did not know that . . . comedic fantasy author terry pratchett was knighted for his ' services to literature ' .
17691,"i've never heard of him , but i do know that winston churchill won a nobel prize in literature ."
17692,wait . . . you've never heard of winston churchill ? ? ? ?
17693,terry pratchett is the one whom i've never heard of . i'm wellversed in the writings of churchill .
17694,whew ! i was going to be a little bugged with the educatin system !
17695,"lol . it's the fda we have to be worried about , they like to burn literature ."
17696,haha . . . the hubble telescope discovered a galaxy so big that it shouldn't exist according to modern physics . who knew !
17697,i love looking at the images that the hubble sent back . it's fascinating that pixar spent three years studying curly hair .
17698,"that's interesting . turbulence is one of physics great mysteries , and van gogh could accurately depict it in some of his paintings . i hate it on planes though . . ."
17699,"i feel the same . van gogh was very interesting . i didn't know that kim jong un has a degree in physics , thats surprising"
17700,from where though ? is it like one of our honorary ones ?
17701,"i don't know . i don't know much about him . maybe china , as the terra cotta army may lead scholars to a breakthrough in quantum physics ."
17702,nice chatting with you !
17703,good morning ! how are you ?
17704,"hello there , i am well thank you . how about you ? do you like to read much ?"
17705,"i'm well too ! i do like to read , how about you ?"
17706,"yeah i do , but don't do it as much as i would like to . did you know there are more libraries than mcdonalds in the us ?"
17707,that's a great fact to hear ! you would think mcdonalds outnumbers everything else in this country haha .
17708,"yeah i was quite surprised by that fact , i would have thought it was the other way around ."
17709,can you believe at some point the fda burned six tons of literature in an act of us censorship ?
17710,that is crazy ! it sounds like a real life version of that book fahrenheit 451 !
17711,well said ! i'm glad we got away from that type of nonsense ! did you know winston churchill won a nobel prize ?
17712,"i didn't know that , do you know what he won it for ?"
17713,"he won it for literature surprisingly , and not peace !"
17714,"that is awesome ! i know back in 1895 , uk pm william gladstone founded a public library and by age 85 , he wheelbarrowed his personal collection of 32 , 000 books almost a mile to the library from his home !"
17715,dang i wonder how many trips he took moving all of those !
17716,"that is a good point , 32 , 000 books sounds like a heck of a lot of wheelbarrow runs !"
17717,"it does ! if i release a book , i'm going to do it in norway because you're bound to sell at least 1000 copies haha ."
17718,"that is pretty wild , the government stepping in and buying them to distribute to libraries around the country , cool ."
17719,super cool ! do you ride horses at all ?
17720,"i don't , but think they are really impressive , i have an aunt who does . how about you ?"
17721,i don't but have an aunt also lol . did you see two high school kids got suspended for riding their horses to school ?
17722,"lol , yeah i think i read about that , sounds like they were doing what they were supposed to by not riding a motorized vehicle ."
17723,"smart in my book ! well anyways , great chat , have an awesome day !"
17724,"hi turker , do you spend much time in the library ?"
17725,not any more but i used to . i do like knowing that in norway the government will buy copies your book that you publish and put them in libraries . it sounds like they really support their libraries .
17726,i didn't know that until recently . i was a big fan of the library .
17727,did you know that our own fda burns six tons of literature calling it censorship ?
17728,"i heard that information once , but i haven't read much about it ."
17729,it makes you wonder what all was lost . libraries are definitely important .
17730,"yes it is , how do you get most of your information from since you no longer go to the library , from the computer ?"
17731,i've never thought about it but i guess i do . how about you ?
17732,"i get almost all my information from the computer , but it is putting a strain on my eyes ."
17733,i know what you mean there . books don't put as much a strain as computers do .
17734,can you imagine being falsely imprisoned for 10 years and spend most of the time at a library trying to prove your innocence ?
17735,no but it is very admirable of the person to do so .
17736,"you are right , i guess there is no limits when it comes to being free especially if they are innocence ."
17737,"hey , what do you think of horses ? an interesting fact about them is that those lipizzaner horses are actually born black or brown and take about 6 years to turn white !"
17738,"wow , that amazing , i love horses and was raised on a farm . i learned to ride them when i was small ."
17739,me too . to this day i still find them fascinating !
17740,"yes i do , i don't like when horses are being raced for years and if they don't win races , they put them away most of the time , if you know what i am saying ."
17741,i do and i agree . i don't like to see them whipped either .
17742,"i went to a live race track , the horse and jockey fell ."
17743,was the horse okay ?
17744,"yes and no , because the horse had a slight limp . the jockey was okay ."
17745,i certainly hope they gave the horse a chance to heal .
17746,are you a fan of soccer ?
17747,yes . the foot ball world cup simply called as fifa world cup . it is international competition contested by the senior men's team .
17748,yes ! the city which is set to host the 2022 qatar fifa world cup final does not exist yet . how does that work ?
17749,the 21 world cup tournaments were won 8 teams . the world cup is most prestigious tournament in the world . all the nation in the world want to lift the fifa trophy .
17750,yes ! the hungary national team only had 1 defeat between 1950 and 1956 and that was the world cup final ! what are the odds ?
17751,us got 3rd place in the first fifa world cup in 1930 . the american team has never placed below third place in the world cup since women world cup started in 1991 !
17752,i'm betting on third place finishes from now on . lol did you know that there are no net economic gains for the countries that have played hosted to the olympics or the world cup ?
17753,"already 17 countries hosted the football world cup , qatar has planned to hosts 2022 finals , 2026 will jointly hosted by canada , us and mexico ."
17754,"nice ! the current champion is france , who won on the 2018 fifa world cup on july 15th ."
17755,after 1908 summer olympics in london football became official competitions .
17756,"i didn't know that . at the 2014 world cup , there were more french born players playing against france than for it ."
17757,it is very sad . very different to handle this situation .
17758,"lol if the algerian team had beaten germany in their last world cup game , they would have gone on to play france on the exact date of the french invasion of algeria's capital on july 4 , 1830 . ironic ."
17759,"german goalkeeper harald schumacher collided with french defender patrick battiston in the 1982 world cup semifinal , all the player are very aggressive to win the trophy for the nation ."
17760,"wow ! did you know that soccer makes more money that football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis , and hockey combined ?"
17761,yeah . it has record of highest attendance to watch the game .
17762,nice . americans call it soccer because it was slang for association football !
17763,soccer is a team sport played with a spherical ball between two team of eleven players .
17764,did you hear of the soccer variation where 3 teams face each other at the same time ? it's been fun chatting .
17765,yeah . very nice chatting with you . have a great day .
17766,you have a great day too !
17767,hello
17768,hi . have you heard the news in olympics ? its been 114 years since someone has won a gold medal
17769,"yes sure , do you know ledecka , primarily a snowboarder , who won the women's superg on skis"
17770,"yes and she even competed in 2 different sports although most people think that skiing and snowboarding are the same , they are quite different"
17771,"here are dozens of athletes who compete in complimentary disciplines of the same sport such as lolo jones , whom i like a lot"
17772,ive read that in todays modern times that most athletes simply cant get the time to master two sports so its exciting when that happens
17773,"and also , and historically , national teams used athletes from sports that involved similar skillsets such as swimmers who play water polo or pentathletes who are also shooters , swimmers , fencers , runners and equestrians to save money or because teams lacked a depth of talent , do you agree ?"
17774,i agree it is a wise idea to use the same athlete but what about the guy flack that tried to run the marathon and passed out while in the lead
17775,"yes that is for sure , there simply isn't enough time in the day for modern elite athletes to master two sports . to the layperson , skiing and snowboarding look pretty similar"
17776,"on the topic of sports , did you know that soccer makes more money combined than even football and other sports . wow"
17777,yes i know cause i adore soccer lol . did you know oe lydon won a bronze medal as a welterweight boxer in the 1904 st . louis games and a silver medal in soccer .
17778,you like soccer and i like the gymnastics which i think is one of the older sports that even greeks in ancient times practiced gymnastics to ready for war . thats interesting
17779,"wow cool , i like gymnastics too . and do you know anytihing about association football ?"
17780,i know association football is extremely popular as it is played in over 200 countries and i know that americans call it soccer which is slang for association football
17781,"and also there exists a variation of soccer where 3 teams face each other at the same time , its very interesting"
17782,"3 teams , that is unique . the story of a german soccer player who won the world cup and paid for 23 children in brazil to have surgeries is an amazing story ."
17783,yes and do you love tennis ?
17784,i do like tennis . a fun fact about tennis is that polo shirts were invented because of tennis . a famous player rene lacoste created them and later was adopted by polo players
17785,a black man won the 1st us open tennis title in 1968 and no black man has won it since .
17786,i think that was arthur ashe if i am not mistaken . i was surprised to learn that the longest tennis match in history was over 10 hours long and lasted 3 days ! i bet those players were tired
17787,yes i agree with you totally
17788,"the game that most of the world calls football , but the us calls soccer is played on a pitch ."
17789,what do you mean by plays on a pitch ? i do like association football aka soccer haha what about you ?
17790,that is what the field is called . it is rectangular and has a goal at each end .
17791,"i see now . i did know that you score by shooting the ball into the goal . what's crazy to me is that soccer makes more money than football , basketball , tennis , and all other sports combined"
17792,i know . lots of people play it . over 250 million in the world . i coached it when my daughter was young .
17793,oh that's cool . i used to play when i was a kid . interesting why americans call it soccer . i guess that's because its slang for association football
17794,we already had a sport called football . jon stewart actually represented the us in the pan am games in brazil in 1983 playing soccer
17795,i did know that . did you ever watch him in the daily show ? i want to see this variation of soccer that three teams play
17796,"i do enjoy his humor , but i am a capitalist and not a socialist so i don't agree with him politically . i cannot imagine how 3 teams playing can make sense ."
17797,i agree with you . i definitely don't like his politics . he was in the movie big daddy with adam sandler and i did like that movie . have you ever played tennis ?
17798,"i have . i had a female neighbor who played club level competition and she found me , a male , to be a good training partner . a serve that is not returned is one objective of the game ."
17799,yep that's true . i used to play when i was in high school . i like playing with two people which they called doubles
17800,"that is a surprisingly different game . polo shirts were invented for tennis by rene ' the crocodile ' lacoste . thus , the brand for polo ."
17801,you'd think it would have been invented by a polo player . did you know that a black man won the first us open title in 1968
17802,no . there haven't been many prominent us players who were male and black . but the williams sisters have sure been something . the tennis ball is hollow .
17803,yes the williams sisters are really good . the black man that won back in 1968 has been the only one to do so but i know that we will have more in the future
17804,"could be . i am from oklahoma and barry switzer said that the best black athletes that used to play for him now go into basketball instead . so , it will require some black athletes to direct their efforts toward tennis before they win a lot . i hope to see it ."
17805,that makes sense . pretty crazy that they use the helicopter to dry grass tennis courts back in 1969 . i bet the us open was a really crazy place back then
17806,how about a match that lasted 11 hours and was spread over 3 days ?
17807,yep that would be exhausting ! i would feel so bad for the guy that lost . so much effort for so little reward
17808,great point ! i have seen a cricket match last for 8 hours . nice chat !
17809,hey did you see that originally croatia was going to be the runner up to the world cup ?
17810,"yeah , i did . do you watch much soccer ?"
17811,"no not usually , i probably won't watch the 2022 world cup in qatar , what about you ?"
17812,"me either . lol but i enjoy watching the fan's behaviors , they can get pretty wild about their soccer ."
17813,"ya they really get into it , it is cool that the usa got third place in the 1930 world cup , back when they were good haha"
17814,"yeah , that's cool . i find it funny that were more french born players playing against france than for it in the 2014 world cup ."
17815,"ha that is funny , did you hear about how awesome hungary is at soccer ? they had only 1 defeat back between 1950 and 1956"
17816,that's pretty impressive !
17817,"the usa womens soccer team is impressive too , they haven't placed below 3rd since 1991"
17818,go usa ! awesome ladies . have you ever seen the type of soccer that pits three teams against each other at the same time ?
17819,"no i haven't but i bet it would be more interesting than regular soccer , its amazing that soccer is played by 250 million people worldwide"
17820,"lol , i know ! you know when you asked me if i would be watching the 2022 world cup , did you realize that city where it will be held has not even been built yet ?"
17821,"lol nope but thats not a good sign , i can't believe that soccer makes more money than all other sports combined , thats a ton of money"
17822,it is a pile of money . i heard that jon stewart was a pretty good soccer player in college .
17823,"ya he was , he actually represented the us in the pan american games back in 1983"
17824,did you hear about the german soccer player who donated his bonus he got for winning the world cup to pay for 23 kids surgeries in brazil ?
17825,"wow that was nice of him ! back to qatar , i wonder why they are building the city for that game , apparently no country gets a net economic increase from hosting the world cup"
17826,"probably some rich oil tycoon wants to brag about his city hosting the world cup ? who knows why they do what they do , they have more money than they know what to do with , apparently ."
17827,yeah it sounds like it . did you ever hear why americans called game soccer and not football ? apparently the word soccer is slang for association football
17828,leave it up to americans ! what can i say we like our slang words .
17829,"haha ya we do , it's interesting how world wars can mess with sports , they didn't do a world cup in 1942 or 1946 due to wwii"
17830,"hi , how are you ?"
17831,"good , how are you ? do you watch soccer ?"
17832,"i do watch soccer , do you ?"
17833,yes i love to watch the fifa world cup
17834,me too ! who's your favorite team ?
17835,"i always root for spain , they are pretty good . you ?"
17836,"i root for the usa , although we are terrible and didn't make the last world cup . how did you do ?"
17837,not too bad but did not win either . the us women's team is good though
17838,yeah . they are the only thing we have to look forward to in soccer . it's the whole system that needs revamping .
17839,yesh for sure . and the host countries never make any money for hosting the world cup
17840,seems like a bad investment then . do you think qater should host the 2022 world cup ?
17841,i am not sure considering the city hosting does not exist yet
17842,right ? how can fifa approve that ? seems shady . . .
17843,"i am not sure , i really find that strange . did you know in 2014 there were more frenchborn players playing against it than in the actual french team ?"
17844,i had no idea ! that's really strange . france may have a really good farm system though .
17845,do you know lilian thuram ?
17846,i do not . who is that
17847,french soccer player who scored only two international goals in his career both at the 2014 worlds cup
17848,"soccer makes more money that football , basketball , baseball , golf and tennis and hockey combined . wow !"
17849,"yeah they really make a lot of money , it is a worldwide sport though"
17850,nice chatting with you !
17851,"hi , do you like tennis ?"
17852,"i played it once in high school , tennis is a lot harder than it looks lol"
17853,tennis first played between 1859 birmingham and 1865 england .
17854,yea and tennis can also be played with two players on each side
17855,yes . the tennis equipments are tennis ball and tennis racket .
17856,i never knew that polo shirts were invented for tennis player rene lacoste
17857,okay . rene lacoste won 10 grand slam tennis tournaments in the 1920 and 30's .
17858,pretty cool . did you know that a black man only won the us open once back in 1968 ?
17859,"yes , i know archur ashe won the men's singles final at the first u . s . open in 1968 ."
17860,do you know who played in the longest tennis match lasting 11 hours ?
17861,"yes , i know 8 years ago at wimbledon , john isner and nicolas mahut played the longest ever tennis match in history . the match went on for three days and took place over 11 hours and 5 minutes with isher coming out victorious 1068 in the final set ."
17862,"that's pretty crazy , wonder if they had to use a helicopter to dry the grass like they did in the 1968 us open"
17863,i don't know .
17864,"do you follow soccer at all , it makes more money than football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis , and hockey combined"
17865,i love tennis and basket ball games .
17866,nice . there's a variation of soccer with 3 teams facing off against each other
17867,yes . and i also love gymnastics . it's really beautiful . they are awesome .
17868,"gymnastics is fun to watch , one olympic gymnast won 6 medals with a wooden leg in 1904"
17869,"yeah , i know . it was awesome . it was george louis eyser and was a germanamerican gymnast ."
17870,nice . the first person to score a perfect 10 was nadia comaneci from romania
17871,first woman to score a perfect 10 in an olympic gymnastics event at the 1976 olympic games at age 14 .
17872,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
17873,do you watch the world cup ?
17874,yes i saw it along with the 3 . 2 billion other people around the world who watched it as well . did you see it ?
17875,"yeah , i like soccer , a lot of people do , even jon stewart was a really good soccer player ."
17876,"jon stewart , the comedian ? yeah , do you know where the next world cup will be played ?"
17877,"it will be in qatar , i think , they have to build a lot of infrastructure to accommodate it ."
17878,"yeah , i imagine there would also have to be a lot of ac since it can get very very hot in those climates !"
17879,"and a lot of power plants have to be build , they have to build a city where the final will be hosted . i think it is a little too much money ."
17880,"i wonder if these investments ever return a positive cash flow , to me it just doesn't seem like it's possible at all . i'd also imagine they'd have to loosen up on visa restrictions to get more visitors ."
17881,"yeah i don't think they are like the german player who gave his world cup victory bonus to brazilian children , who needed surgeries ."
17882,"that's quite commendable , a lot of the other players should follow suit ! but considering that soccer players run an average of 7 miles per game , they might be too tired to think rationally ."
17883,"there is also a variation of soccer with 3 teams , they would run even more . i wonder what rules they have for it ."
17884,"wow , they must be in great shape ! all except for the people in greenland who can't join fifa because not enough grass grows there for soccer fields . that doesn't mean players can't play right ?"
17885,"they could play on astroturf . they probably do , it is a popular sport ."
17886,"yeah but even with playing on turf , they still won't be able to join the leagues . surprising to see size and scale of super bowl relative to soccer , super bowl is only an american thing while soccer is global , i guess ."
17887,"i think it comes to a question of equipment , you only need a ball and 2 goal for soccer ."
17888,"i see . then there's logos and mascots , the french national team uses a rooster because rooster in latin is similar to the name used for gaul or the current day france , who knew there's meaning behind these things ."
17889,"football , is full of details , american call it soccer because it comes from association football"
17890,"that's a very good one ! then there's the colors of jerseys . the french team did a bad job of coordinating the team jersey and they found it was the same color as their opponents , so they had to borrow a different color jersey from a local team . that's hilarious , they should've played as is , that would've made an entertaining game to watch ."
17891,"yeah , instead of a game with 2 teams , there would have been only 1 , everybody is a winner ! . . . and a loser ."
17892,do people place bets on the outcome of those games ?
17893,"i don't know anything about betting of soccer matches . but i suppose so , it is played in 200 countries . some of them must permit betting on matches ."
17894,"yeah , i think that might be the next big thing !"
17895,"hello there , are you a fan of football , or soccer as they call it in the us ?"
17896,yes ! i am one of 250 million people in world who play soccer haha
17897,"yeah same here , i don't know why we call it soccer here in the states , do you know why they started calling it that ?"
17898,"i think it's something to do with it being a slang name for association football . did you know that soccer makes more money than football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis , and hockey combined ?"
17899,"yep , good call , started as a slang term for association football . and that is pretty remarkable , i like when people here say it's not a popular sport ."
17900,they should televise the variation of soccer where there are 3 teams that face off at the same time . maybe they would get more spectators in the us
17901,"that sounds too crazy , i wonder if they used the same size field or not ."
17902,it's hard to believe that jon stewart was a really skilled soccer player . he actually represented the us at the pan american games in brazil . i guess for him there was more money in comedy .
17903,"that is pretty impressive , i never knew that and don't think most people have ."
17904,are you into any other sports ?
17905,"i am , i really like basketball and my favorite team has the best record in the league right now ! how about you ?"
17906,i really enjoy watching tennis . although when i play it the object for me is more to just get the ball over the net than to return it in such a way that my opponent is not able to return it haha it is definitely harder than it looks !
17907,"yeah it really is , that sport takes a lot of skill and endurance to play that's for sure ."
17908,"i enjoy watching roger federer , he is such a talented player . well , except for the time he lost to gael monfils who had just learned to play tennis a few days before their match ."
17909,"really , i'm sure that was the thrill of a lifetime for that person to beat him !"
17910,i'm sure ! i would rather be known as the guy who beat roger federer than one of the players in the longest tennis match in history . it went on for 11 hours ! can you imagine how exhausted the athletes would have been after that !
17911,"that is just insane , i wonder how many people from the original crowd that started the match were still there to watch the end ."
17912,"i know , right ? that would take some serious commitment ! it spanned over 3 days ."
17913,"right , i wonder if they got back into the place free each day ?"
17914,i would hope so ! i am just so impressed by the athleticism . and you hear about olympic athletes like edwin black who are able to win a bronze medal in the olympics for tennis doubles and gold medals in 800 and 1500 meter races . i would be so excited if i was that talented at one sport let alone two !
17915,"that is the most impressive thing i have heard in a while . it was nice talking with you , i hope you have a good day ."
17916,"hello , do you like dogs ?"
17917,they have their moments . i appreciate that they are one of only two animals able to instinctively understand pointing .
17918,thats interesting . i recently read that dogs have 12 different blood types .
17919,"that's a lot , more than humans ! did you know that dogs aren't actually colorblind ? they just can't see as as many colors as people ."
17920,"yeah , thats good to know . i used to think that they were colorblind ."
17921,"i guess color isn't as important when you can do so many different tasks , from hunting and herding to aiding disabled people ."
17922,"yeah , it probably is not a need for them ."
17923,they certainly are man's best friend . google even has a policy that states that they are a dog company .
17924,"i agree , i love my dog , i do wish she would laugh at my jokes once in awhile though lol thats really cool about google !"
17925,"i guess a laughing dog would be a good companion . in boulder , co , people don't even ' own ' their pets because of that idea of the relationship ; you're just their ' guardian '"
17926,"oh wow , that interesting , i never knew that . in istanbul they have vending machines the release food and water for strays , in exchange for recycled plastic bottles ."
17927,"that's a neat idea . it would come in useful in a country like japan , where there are more pets than children under 15 ."
17928,wow that is incredible ! they have that many dogs ! yeah that would be pretty useful !
17929,"i think they probably have more cats than dogs , given the land limitations there haha . you know who had a lot of pets ? teddy roosevelt ; he had over 20 , including a bear and a hyena ."
17930,"thats crazy ! i'm sure he had help though , for an average american that is a lot of work . i read that the first cat cloned was named copy cat lol"
17931,that's clever . maybe they can clone tigers to increase their numbers ; there are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia !
17932,"wow that is really sad . they should clone all the endangered species , might need a bigger lab for larger animals like sharks lol"
17933,"i'm not sure how practical that would be , since it's so hard to track those populations anyway to figure out if they need new members ."
17934,"well the discovery channel is always making shows about endangered animals , so they could start there . i know sharks are endangered and a few types of bears ."
17935,i think in the mean time it's important to raise proper therapy animals ; it seems like some people just claim regular pets are therapy animals . maybe that could be a discovery channel show !
17936,"yeah seriously , people take advantage of that just so their regular pets can go to restaurants and stuff . its kind of annoying , they claim its a ' support ' dog ."
17937,"yes , i think children in hospitals and elderly folks in nursing homes need the company more to lift their spirits and work on their goals . nice chatting !"
17938,"i love goldendoodles , i have one myself . she's only forty pounds not eighty like lord sandwich ."
17939,"i think lord sandwich is a funny name lol , they started a winery back in 2014 right ?"
17940,"i do like that name as well . i wish that my dog had an unusual name like his . i would have put my dog on the label from the beginning . yes , they did open in 2014 ."
17941,"you can still change its name lol it would be confused but eventyally will answer to the name , its amazing how they raised 25000 in just 30 days"
17942,"i think it would be more confusing for me after six years ! if you have a nice , unique product and the proper rewards , you can get a lot of funding through kickstarter ."
17943,"i agree , its a good way to fund your company , its amazing how many followers lord sandwich has on instragram 65k ! !"
17944,"do you follow any animals on instagram ? i have to admit that i do , i might have to look up lord sandwich ."
17945,"i dont but i might make an exeption for lord sandwich , im curious to meet the little guy ,"
17946,80 pounds and as tall as doorknobs makes me think he isn't so little . i wonder if they made a white wine for him based on his fur color ?
17947,"i think they took that into account , you know they are planning to release a wine with his name in it , it will be a white wine production"
17948,are you a big wine drinker ? i am not but i might make an exception for this one .
17949,"i do like wine , and i might look up some of the wines the company has to offer , they have a germany region based wine that has a price of 20 so i might try that one"
17950,i do like to try less expensive wines because i do not know the difference as much between vintages . i do not know if i have tried many wines from the german region .
17951,"yeah i dont know much about wine either i do like the taste of pinot noir , i think its interesting how they are planning to make wines from regions such as austria and loirey valley"
17952,it's definitely great to explore the different regions . it could open their client base up immensely and help people find new wines they might not have known about .
17953,"i think its a good business decision , you got to keep things fresh and updated , so do you have any pets ?"
17954,i only have the one goldendoodle . i often watch my sister's dog so it feels as if i have two dogs a lot of the time .
17955,"thats nice , so im guessing your more of a dog person that a cat person ?"
17956,"yes , i have an allergy to cat hair so i was kind of forced into it . i don't otherwise mind them in small doses ."
17957,"i am more of a dog person and so is google , they prefer dogs to cats and they have made this clear"
17958,i think that in an office setting dogs are a bit more sociable and appropriate than cats . cats tend to be very self sufficient and isolated .
17959,"yea i agree with you dogs and cats are the most popular pets , you know roosevelt had over 20 pets , he had a bear and also a hyena as pets ."
17960,did you hear about the goldendoodle who helped to create a wine brand ?
17961,i did ! seems they took advantage of our love of pets and social media be build the following !
17962,"they certainly did ! it's cool that they raised 25 , 000 in 30 days , just because of the theme ' farmers first '"
17963,we love dogs and have 2 . they aren't golden doodles but we got them from a rescue group . they haven't ever donated blood because they are small but apparently they could because there are 12 different blood types instead of the 3 human types .
17964,that is interesting . i didn't know there were that many dog blood types . i hope that the dogs get a treat after the blood drive though .
17965,"they should ! i guess we are google type of people since they prefer dogs to cats . i do like cats , but i'm really allergic to them . : ,"
17966,"yep i'm glad that google prefers dogs to cats lol . i am allergic to them too but i do like them . i think it's crazy that only dogs can elephants understand pointing , not even gorillas which you think would be very smart"
17967,"hmm . it does seem weird that other primates don't get pointing . i have a dog that loves a yellow ball and she ignores the other colored balls . i guess yellow must be one of the colors they can see . i know they don't see all the ones we do , but she must see that one !"
17968,"i agree with you ! i'm just glad that dogs are not actually colorblind , they just see different colors from us , poor doggos !"
17969,i like that istanbul exchanges used water bottles for water and food for stray dogs ! things like that would help the rescue group we got our dogs from .
17970,i think that's a really good use of stray dogs though . it's very smart . do you wear socks by the way ?
17971,"i'm wearing two pairs now , because it is really cold today ! but i don't like wool socks because they are scratchy , to me ."
17972,yep i agree . it's funny that the oldest known socks were supposed to be worn with sandals and that is definitely not what is in fashion now lol
17973,right ! the old socks and flip flops are not a good combo ! i think it's funny that 'put a sock in it' comes from the habit of stuffing a sock in the old phonograph so it's wouldn't be so loud .
17974,yep i agree . it's funny that the inventor of the modern sock also produced the first modern water balloon . i wonder what he was thinking about
17975,i don't know but my kids are sure happy . they love to throw water balloons in the summer ! have you ever thought to donate socks to a homeless shelter ? seems that is an item they really need but don't often get .
17976,"no i haven't done that , but i guess i should . i think it's funny that the phrase ' put a sock in it ' was invented 1800s lol"
17977,"since it's cold today , maybe i should try putting chili peppers in my socks to keep my feet warm , like the portuguese . i guess they cut them up first ?"
17978,lol that's a good question . it sounds like it would hurt though . you have any pets ?
17979,"i already mentioned that i have 2 dogs , several times ! it's funny that in colorado you have to say you are a pets 'guardian' and not that you own them !"
17980,"yep you're right , i was only paying attention to myself because i have a husky lol . it's weird that the first cloned cat was named copycat though ."
17981,are you familiar with fifa world cup ?
17982,i am a little familiar with it . i think i have watched a few games on television . do you watch ?
17983,i watched them in the past since my good friend is from england . the current champion is france .
17984,i remember watching a few of those games that were in russia on television . i would have thought russia would benefit economically from hosting but apparrently hosting countries don't get any financial boosts .
17985,i was surprised to hear about it . i think it has to do with pride more than anything else .
17986,you are probably right . i mean qatar is building a whole new city just to host the 2022 games .
17987,"most of the hosts have tons of money to spare . qatar is going to hot in 2022 , is that correct ?"
17988,"that is correct . you know , the media says soccer is not all the popular in the u . s . but it got 3rd place in the first world cup in 1930 !"
17989,i know . that was not bad for a new comer .
17990,"true ! i suppose they are not as good as argentina or have the worlds best player , messi , on their team ."
17991,messi is very good at soccer . he was almost allowed to leave the club for free 10 years ago .
17992,i think it's cool and also odd that no one in his hometown can name a kid messi anymore .
17993,i did not know that ? please tell me the reason why .
17994,out of respect for him . they want him to be the only one .
17995,i wonder if there is an official ordinance for that . it's weird .
17996,i imagine there is as that would just add to the respect they have for him . did you know that there is a soccer game where 3 teams face each other ?
17997,no i did not . please tell me more about it .
17998,apparently each team faces each other at the same time ! this i would like to see but it must not be very popular as main stream media does not talk about it or show it .
17999,that was interesting 3 teams facing each other .
18000,i know . i can only imagine how that must be played .
18001,"it would be chaotic , i think . i keep saying soccer instead of football because it is what being called in the us ."
18002,do you like soccer ? the first world cup was in 1930
18003,"hello , i do like soccer . did you know new zealand was the only undefeated team in the 2010 world cup ?"
18004,american womens team has never placed below third in the world cup
18005,that's interesting . i always thought they were good too .
18006,the city thats set for the 2022 world cup doesnt even exist yet . are they building an entire city ? ?
18007,that's hilarious ! i wonder how that is going to work out .
18008,"i dont know . lol . soccer makes more money than football , basketball , golf , tennis and hockey combined . i can't believe that"
18009,that's amazing . i would have never guessed that . there was only 1 group in world cup history to end with a 4way tie .
18010,there is a variation of soccer where 3 teams face off at the same time . how in the world does that work ? and where is it played ?
18011,that would be very fun to watch . i am not sure where it's played .
18012,"a german soccer player used his world cup earnings to pay for surgeries for 23 children , now why don't more players do stuff like that instead of wasting all the money on frivolous things ?"
18013,very cool and good for him . i love hearing stories like that . it melts my heart .
18014,mine too . there are no economic gains for the countries that host world cup or olympic games . i cant see how that is true all of the people flocking to your city must be good for business
18015,i find that interesting because i always thought it helped their economy . did you know greenland can't join fifa because not enough grass grows there for a soccer field ?
18016,hahah its funny because its greenland . i wonder why they dont lay sod ? or maybe its just too cold
18017,haha i heard greenland is actually all ice and cold and that iceland is actually warmer and green .
18018,yes thats exactly right . the world cup was not held in 1942 or 46 because of ww2
18019,did not know that . the super bowl is smaller than soccer's third biggest event .
18020,how is that even possible and where does it take place ? certainly not in america .
18021,not really sure lol . i would not think it's possible either .
18022,good talk !
18023,hi ! do you like superheroes ?
18024,i do like some superheroes . i dont usually watch superhero movies . you ?
18025,it depends . i cannot believe that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the us .
18026,i wonder how you get to register a superhero . i would love to have my own superhero .
18027,i do not know . i feel like that would be an awesome present for children .
18028,"yes , happy birthday . you have your own superhero ! lol . the universe is a big place and there is plenty of room for new superheros ."
18029,did you hear about the spinoff of garfield ?
18030,i did not . garfield ? was that strip ever funny ?
18031,the spinoff was named pet force which featured garfield and gang as superheroes .
18032,hm . i think ill pass . i never really like garfield . maybe as a superhero it would be funnier . lol
18033,i agree . have you heard about ' normalman ' ?
18034,"um , sounds like me lol . who is normalman ?"
18035,he is a person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes .
18036,that is ironic . i wonder what he does all day . i guess he is the butt of jokes . hard to find a girl friend . he is a freak .
18037,poor normalman . there is another comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes .
18038,"yeah , that would be a thankless job . putting things back to the way they were ? what do you want , a medal ? no thanks . ill be a superhero ."
18039,very true . do you know who the creator of marvel comics was ?
18040,"um , stan lee ? jack kirby ? i forget . who was it ?"
18041,his name is stan lee and wrote 15 dc comics .
18042,"what ? he wrote dc comics too ? ok . i wonder why he did that . anyway , great chat !"
18043,i am going to learn more about comic books . it was nice talking to you .
18044,have a great day ! enjoy your comics .
18045,you too .
18046,do you have a favorite superhero ?
18047,yes i do ! i really like deadpool and batman haha what about you
18048,"those are great choices . i loved the deadpool movies , i was all about the xmen growing up"
18049,well what do you think about the superhero the black panther by the way ? apparently he is the richest superhero even richer than batman
18050,i loved the movie and the concept . people think he was named after the black panther party but was named before that . i didn't know he was that rich !
18051,i didn't know that either ! it's cool that they used an actual ancient language from the 4th century as the symbols in that movie
18052,wow that is so interesting . did you know the guy who played black panther got his start because of denzel washington .
18053,"that . apparently when he was giving his speech during the black panther premiere and actually thanked denzel for his support back then , that's really nice of him"
18054,"wow , very nice . remember your roots is how i feel . stan lee wrote black panther and all the marvel comics , crazy"
18055,"he's very talented ! he also wrote a bunch of comics for dc apparently , and he was reimagining superheroes like batman and superman , those would be interesting to read"
18056,"wow , that is awesome . i think i heard he wrote like 15 comics for dc"
18057,yep you're right . i also heard that garfield has a spinoff where he is a superhero lol that sounds kind of cool
18058,"that would be fun to read . i wonder how that went , he could sling lasagna ."
18059,"haha i want to eat lasagna that makes me hungry . speaking of superheroes , did you know that there are over 300 superheroes that have been registered in the united states ?"
18060,"wow , that is a lot . is that in the comics or in real life ?"
18061,"haha . just for the comics . but there is a comic called normal man . he's the only person in his universe that is normal and has no superpowers , everyone else is a superhero"
18062,i didn't know there was a comic about me lol ! i wonder if he was in the comic strip about fixing the collateral damage caused by super heroes
18063,"haha yes i think so . that actually sounds pretty interesting . and i never knew that comic book started in the 1930s , i would have thought they started earlier than that"
18064,wow that was a long time ago ! i wonder what those comics are worth now . it was so nice chatting with you !
18065,"yes , crooks can be worth a lot of money . and i know that there's even a college campus that has the largest public comic book collection in the world , i think it's in michigan i should check it out !"
18066,"wow , i need to check it out . i am going to google that ! have a great night !"
18067,"hello , have you ever thought about how important google has become ?"
18068,"i have , its the 1 search engine , it has become really big ."
18069,i heard that on august 16 2013 google went down for five minutes and disrupted 40 percent of web traffic
18070,"wow that is amazing , 40 percent of the web traffic ? have you ever used the google maps app ?"
18071,no but i know that it calculates traffic by the speed of android devices moving down the road . i think that is interesting .
18072,"it does , ive always wondered how they did that , i guess mystery solved , its amazing how much power a single google search requires ."
18073,ive read that a single search takes more computing than it took to send men to the moon . thats hard to believe .
18074,"i know right ? technology surely has advanced a lot , kind of like iphones , ive been loyal to the brand since the first generation iphone was released back in 2007"
18075,did you know that microsoft held a funeral for the death of iphone when it launched its version of the phone ?
18076,"i did not know that how interesting , i wonder who went to the funeral !"
18077,good question . probably a marketing idea . i heard of a game called send me to heaven that was created to have people throw their phones in the air and break them
18078,"that game doesnt seem fun to play , i think that the game got banned because it was actually more popular in the end ."
18079,apple banned the game because it was encouraging users to engage in behavior that might damage the device .
18080,"i think that was a good decision , you know theres a stat and woman are more likely to have an iphone than men ."
18081,that is an interesting stat . are there any ideas as to why this is true . i also heard that matt bellamy used an iphone to record his unborn childs heartbeat .
18082,"im not sure maybe because of the desig , you know theres more than 2 . 2 million apps available for the iphone now"
18083,thats a lot of apps . the iphone has come along way as to what it can be used for . so many uses its amazing .
18084,i know 2 . 2 million apps its a lot and that was in 2017 i bet there a lot more new apps now
18085,im sure you're right probably many more apps for different uses by now .
18086,"yeah , so do you play any instruments , ive always liked the sound of the guitar ."
18087,i do play guitar i enjoy listening to pink floyds guitarist .
18088,"i enjoy pink floyd as well , he turned a boat into a floating studio , how cool !"
18089,"hi , how are you ?"
18090,im good how bout yourself
18091,"i am well , thanks . do you know who john lewis is ?"
18092,no i dont who is he .
18093,he is a civil rights protester from georgia . he is now a rep . he marched with king and was invovled with the police brutality in birmingham .
18094,really . he sounds like a pretty stand up guy .
18095,yeah . trump went after him on twitter last year saying he never stood up for anything . twitter was quick to show the police dogs tearing his flesh . . .
18096,"wow , this is the first im hearing of any of this . guess trump stuck his foot in his mouth there huh ."
18097,yeah . it was baffling that he either had no idea or just didn't care . i was both horrified and watching gleefully .
18098,i dont understand . you were watching gleefully as police dogs attacked somebody .
18099,no ! ! ! watching trump getting blasted on twitter . sorry for the confusion . that's not something i really want to get mixed up . sorry about that .
18100,its ok . i kind of figured what you meant by it . lol .
18101,the whole john lewis incident became known as bloody sunday . i cannot imagine what they had to go through .
18102,"me either . it makes me feel a little guilty being a white man today . i know that im no racist and none of my family is , but the things black had to go through back then is horrifying ."
18103,"agreed with all of that . let's lighten this up a little , shall we ? maybe they could write a comic series about fixing all of the collateral damage us white guys did like marvel did ."
18104,that would be awesome . me and my son watch superhero movies all the time . cant hurt to have one more to watch .
18105,that sounds fun . my son is 7 and a little scared still . there are over 300 registered superheros .
18106,maybe he would enjoy the garfield spinoff where garfield and the gang were all superheroes .
18107,is his mortal enemy heart burn from all that lasagna ? or would it be his krytonite ?
18108,lol . im definitely gonna have to check that one out now .
18109,nice chatting with you !
18110,good evening ! guess how google maps calculates traffic ?
18111,hey ! i'd be interested to learn how traffic is calculated
18112,"they go by the gps devices in android phones , which is data they have access to . they track how fast the phones are moving along the road ."
18113,"oh wow , that is interesting and totally makes sense ! i've read they used to use live goats to ' mow ' there lawn . . google uses resources well huh !"
18114,"yes , they once used 100 live goats . only once . i wonder why it didn't continue ."
18115,"i'm imagining 100 live goats around the headquarters lol , probably chaos !"
18116,"yes . i wonder why they didn't use sheep instead , and how much work was involved in cleaning up after the goats ."
18117,probably a lot of cleanup . i cant imagine it was more cost effective than hiring a landscaping company .
18118,"yes , but i think it would have made it a more fun place to work ."
18119,"have to keep the workplace interesting ! like microsoft , holding a funeral for the ' death of the iphone ' when their line of phones was launched ."
18120,yes . have you heard of the ' send me to heaven ' iphone game ? i wonder if microsoft was behind it .
18121,"yes , i've read about that and that would make sense of microsoft doing something like that . so silly"
18122,the creator's stated goal was to shatter as many iphones as possible . i really wonder if it was someone with a financial stake in things or just a person who doesn't like iphones .
18123,that would have to be a really big hatred for iphones .
18124,yeah . i can't believe it made it to the app store .
18125,i was surprised to learn that women are more likely to own an iphone than men .
18126,"yes , it's interesting . i wonder what the reasons are ."
18127,"i see just as many men as i do woman , walking around with their noses stuck in their phone these days !"
18128,yes ! i don't tend to notice whether people's phones are iphones or androids . did you know that the app store for ios has 2 . 2 million apps ?
18129,"oh wow , that is a huge number . i wonder how useful half of those apps are ."
18130,yes . i wonder . it's been good to talk to you . have a good night !
18131,"hi there , do you use google or another search engine ?"
18132,hi ! i love google ! i use it everyday
18133,"nice , me too . apparently to do a search though there is more computing power reauired than it took to send 12 astronauts to the moon"
18134,"on august 16th 2013 , google went down for about 5 minutes and took 40 percent of the web traffic with it . interesting , because that tells us how many people actually use google ."
18135,yeah i think most people use it exclusively . do you know how they calculate traffic ?
18136,i'm not sure . do you ?
18137,yeah they take the average of android devices that are moving on traffic
18138,i like the fact that you can type an address into google and it will take you to google maps . that always comes in handy .
18139,yeah it sure is . do you know when it was founded and by whom ?
18140,i do not . do you know ?
18141,yeah it was larry page and sergey brin in 1998 .
18142,do you know what google's unofficial slogan was ?
18143,i did not know they had one but i am not sure what it is . do you know ?
18144,' don't be evil '
18145,"oh wow , did not expect it to be that . once they hired goats instead of getting people to mow their lawns"
18146,yes that is pretty interesting ! do you know how google maps calculate traffic ?
18147,yeah they take the average of android devices as they move around in traffic
18148,cloud storage comes in handy when you have too many files on your phone .
18149,that has become a life saver honestly . do you have an iphone or android ?
18150,i have an android . iphones seem really complicated to me .
18151,"well , it seems women are more likely to get one than men"
18152,really ? i had no idea .
18153,yeah someone must have done a study on that to find such stats .
18154,hi there ! looking forward to chat with you !
18155,"good evening ! just got back on a quasidate night with my wife . it wasn't much , but we dropped a kid off for practice and drove around a bit ."
18156,quasidate ? what's that ?
18157,"quasi is sort of like ' partly . ' so it wasn't a planned date night , though i know it is important for couples and parents ."
18158,"sounds cool : , what is your kid practicing ? : ,"
18159,she is a soccer player doing futsal this winter . it worked pretty well because our older kids could watch those at home while we had an hour to ourselves .
18160,"good prioritizing : , does she like soccer ? or she goes there coz she has to ? ; 0"
18161,she definitely likes it . the only thing she doesn't like is doing drills by herself at home . i think things like iphones and google just make it easy to be distracted .
18162,"yes those are true enemies of sport when it comes to kids : ,"
18163,do you have an iphone ?
18164,"i have huawei ; , android phone : , you ?"
18165,"mine is a samsung , but i think they are all so similar . plus , i am a guy , and i guess woman are more likely to own iphones . : ,"
18166,"i didn't want to believe that , but all the women i talked about this subject had also iphones : , so i guess that's true : ,"
18167,they apparently haven't downloaded the game ' send me to heaven . ' the goal of that is to see how high you can fling your iphones as the creator of the game said he hoped it would lead to the phones shattering .
18168,"lol . . . sounds like a game for dummies : ,"
18169,ouch . . . lol . might be harder to get as apple banned it from their app store .
18170,"ok , if i would be game creator i would sue ! if somebody wants the game he or she should be able to get it ; , and apple should love the game people would keep buying new phones : ,"
18171,that's a good point . i am not a huge fan of the product . ' iphone ' is not something i spend my time on google looking up .
18172,naah . . i gave up on apple long time ago . i'll buy anything but that . . .
18173,"that sounds like me . while iphone users can't live without their phones , most of the world can't do without google . in 2013 , google went down for five minutes and took a little less than half of web traffic with it !"
18174,"wow . . those guys really need to be watching what their are doing ; ,"
18175,"well , i need to sign off . i need to check google on a few things before bed anyway ."
18176,have you ever heard of john lewis ?
18177,"no , i haven't heard of him . what is he famous for ?"
18178,he was famous for marching along with 600 others from selma to montgomery to demand their voting rights .
18179,was he working with martin luther king ?
18180,"i think he was , instead of being arrested they were badly beaten by the alabama law enforcement officers ."
18181,that sounds like alabama . was the march a success ? did it change political perception ?
18182,"yes , it was a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement ."
18183,what did lewis go on to do after that ?
18184,"who wrote a graphic novel trilogy titled ' march , ' depicting the event ."
18185,that's a great way to tell history . graphic novels are a good way to get people interested . history comes alive .
18186,"yeah , some people view him as a superhero ."
18187,perhaps he could become one of the more than 300 registered superheroes in the us .
18188,that's a lot of superheroes . it's hard fro me to think that they can come up with so many different super powers .
18189,"i wonder if they just get together , drink and smoke , and spitball ideas until something seems good . there is a superhero called ' normalman . ' he was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes ."
18190,"that's funny , never heard of that one , but i definitely could relate to him ."
18191,"in a universe of superheroes , you would be unusual . did you know that there is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe ? strange ."
18192,"no i didn't , there's another theory that the universe might be a giant super hologram ."
18193,that sounds more reasonable . everything is the matrix and we're just here to entertain a bunch of robots . or superheroes .
18194,"yeah , one giant video game ."
18195,and i would be normalman . not a robot . not a superhero .
18196,"yeah , me too !"
18197,hey there partner . are you a soccer fan ? the next world cup is going to be in 2022 in qatar .
18198,i am a soccer fan and watch the world cup ever 4 years !
18199,nice me too ! it's been around since 1930 but i feel like it's only grown in popularity since then .
18200,yes ! zew zealand was the only undefeated team in the 2010 world cup .
18201,well that is really awesome . in the first ever world cup the united states got third place . not bad for the first ever world cup .
18202,not bad at all . there was only 1 group in world cup history to end with a 4 way tie .
18203,i'm surprised they didn't break that tie ! the hungary national football team only had one defeat between 1950 and 1956 and that was the world cup final !
18204,that's pretty incredible . soccer players run an average of 7 miles per game !
18205,no wonder they are in such incredible shape . the fifa world cup was not held in 1942 in 1946 due to the second world war . very sad .
18206,yes . sad indeed . 3 . 2 billion people watched the 2010 fifa world cup !
18207,"that is truly amazing . soccer is so popular and it makes more money than football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis , and hockey combined !"
18208,isn't that incredible ? greenland can't join fifa because not enough grass grows there for a soccer field !
18209,it is so funny because there is a green in the name yet they can't grow green grass . i kind of feel bad for them lol . there's actually a variation of soccer were three teams face each other at the same time . i would like to see that .
18210,i wonder how that works ? sounds like it could get confusing being on the field at the same time .
18211,yeah it would be very confusing to me . the talkshow host john stewart was a skilled soccer player in college and he even represented the us at the panamerican games in brazil .
18212,i didn't realize he was that old . i don't think i remember him until the 1990s .
18213,yeah he is much older than i thought . he looks pretty young for his age . one of the best players in the world is leo messi . he is so fun to watch .
18214,yes . he is valued at 120 million euro ! big money !
18215,big money indeed ! he has a growth hormone deficiency that led him to play soccer in spain ! pretty cool ! and it was lovely speaking with you about many things today !
18216,that's nuts ! lol the first contract given to messi was written on a paper napkin ! i had a good time chatting !
18217,bye !
18218,hi how are you ? do you like soccer ?
18219,i do not play soccer but i watch soccer games from time to time . my boss immigrated to the us from england . he invites us often to watch soccer games at his house .
18220,that is kind of him . i try to watch the world cup . that is a spectacle worth watchng .
18221,"i know , right . soccer fans appear to be more fanatic than us football fans . fifa world cup is a big deal ."
18222,"yes , it is a hugely popular sport everywhere . except the us . americans usually dont understand how popular ."
18223,"3 . 2 billion people watched the 2010 fifa world cup , 46 . 4 percent of global population , ."
18224,"yes , i believe it . they want to see their own country , and to see the sport played at the highest level . it is amazing to watch ."
18225,"it is . apparently , new zealand was the only undefeated soccer team in the 2010 world cup ."
18226,really ? that is amazing . i would not have guessed new zealand .
18227,it was surprising to me too . have you heard about japan's 2021 world cup ?
18228,"no , i have not . they have rugby in 2019 , olympics in 2020 ."
18229,japan is going to project 3rd holograms of the games live onto soccer fields across the world .
18230,that is pretty cool . i wonder how much that will cost . i would love to watch .
18231,i don't know . millions ?
18232,"yeah , i bet . they will sell plenty of tickets . they can project it onto multiple fields at the same time ."
18233,do you have more interesting facts about soccer ?
18234,"um , there is a variant of soccer that involves three teams playing each other ? i dont know how it works though ."
18235,i heard about it but i myself do not really understand how it works .
18236,"the rules must be complicated . free kicks ? out of bounds ? hm . anyway , nice chat !"
18237,i look forward to seeing next fifa world cup . nice chatting with you .
18238,you too ! have a good weekend !
18239,thank you . have a good night .
18240,i find planets very interesting . how about you ?
18241,i do ! ive been listening to a podcast about the universe !
18242,i'm sure that's a good listen . did you know that one of jupiter's moons would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun ?
18243,"yeah , ganymede . it has several moons ."
18244,yes that's the one . did you also know that venus has no seasons ?
18245,"yes , because it doesnt tilt on its axis . despite being second from the sun it is the hottest planet due to its atmosphere ."
18246,that's very interesting . venus is also the only planet that rotates clockwise .
18247,"i guess that is true , i never thought about which way we rotated , but i guess sunrise and set give that away ."
18248,that's true . did you also know that uranus rotates sideways ?
18249,like it rolls ? how does that affect seasons ?
18250,yes it rolls around the sun rather than spinning like other planets . i do not know how that affects it's seasons but i'm curious to find out .
18251,do you believe there is life elsewhere in the universe ?
18252,i believe there is likely microscopic life for sure .
18253,"i often wonder if we are alone in the universe , or of other life is out there , and if they are , are they looking for us too ?"
18254,that's a good question . this is off topic but have you used virtual reality ?
18255,not anything sophisticated . just a few games at what was disney quest .
18256,apparently up to 40 percent of users get motion sickness from vr .
18257,i can see that . i can get a little sick in first person shooter games .
18258,that's unfortunate . did you know that the first vr game was actually made in 1968 ?
18259,wow ! that is even before the nintendo !
18260,yes it's very shocking . it was nice chatting with you .
18261,"what do you think about virtual reality headsets ? they're not just for gaming anymore , you know !"
18262,"i like them , but have never used one . arizona state university will let you use your student loan to pay for a headset ."
18263,"that's so crazy to me . the students can rent them out for no cost , so why should there be an option for them to use financial aid money to purchase them"
18264,the school probably profits in the long run by getting paid interest on the loan . your right about borrowing them . there will be 150 available to students for free .
18265,"oh right , it's student loans , not financial aid . whoops ! still , it seems like a strange use of funds . although i do think that they could be used for a very valuable teaching experience ."
18266,yes . i agree . asu claims that their online biology course is the first in the nation to offer virtual reality labs .
18267,"that's really interesting . i think vr has a lot to offer to the science community . it's an investment , but the marginal costs , how much money it costs to do each progressive lesson , is probably a lot smaller than traditional teaching or research methods"
18268,that would be neat to be able to take the class from the comfort of your home . i wonder if there is any kind of discount for taking classes from home vs . in a real classroom ? the vr set will also come with gloves that will provide the users with a tactile feel experience .
18269,that must be such an immersive experience . the only vr i've experienced was ' santa's sleighride ' and it was in a little car that also shifted like a rollercoaster . but i can see how there are much more important ways to use vr . asu actually uses vr to do things like practice ' taking ' blood samples from people through the vr . i think that's so much better than having students test on real people !
18270,yes ! i agree with you . great learning tool . it will be far more engaging for the students to learn with the headset vs staring at a class on their computer screen as well .
18271,"i agree . i remember being so bored and distracted during class , and now students have social media to distract them . i'm guessing there's no social media in vr , although i could definitely imagine that developing in the future ."
18272,lockheed martin has a ' mars bus ' that will take kids on a tour of mars . that would be neat .
18273,"that's so cool . there's actually a scientist , dr . rich terrile , who thinks that our world is just virtual reality generated on a computer"
18274,didn't he discover several moons on saturn ?
18275,"he did actually ! astronomy is so cool , i think . did you know that there's actually a planet that has shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph at 2000 degrees fahrenheit ?"
18276,"wow . that's incredible . i couldn't even imagine those kind of conditions . if jupiters ganymede moon orbited the sun , it would classify as a planet ."
18277,that's cool ! i feel sad that pluto is not a planet anymore after the international astronomical union redefined the definition of planets in 2006
18278,i know . especially after all those years that we were taught in school that it was a planet . i wish they still used the space shuttle . i used to enjoy watching the launches . the general purpose computer of the shuttle only ran on 1mb of ram .
18279,"i don't know if that's big or small , but i'm guessing small . someone actually built a working 16bit computer using minecraft building blocks ! isn't that absolutely crazy ? so impressive !"
18280,that is neat ! computers are used in everything now doing a wide range of tasks in industrial and consumer devices .
18281,"people actually think it's possible , and want to , upload their minds to memory sticks and computers . i think that's so cool ! such a testament to the future ."
18282,hey there ! have you ever seen the movie the black panther before ? the marvel movie
18283,"no , i haven't , but i have heard of it . what about you ?"
18284,"yes i've seen it . i think it's ok but it's definitely getting too much attention for what it is , it's a pretty generic movie in my opinion ."
18285,"yeah , the marvel movies started to get played out . maybe i will see it ."
18286,yeah you can see it if it's free haha . i wouldn't pay any money to see it . do you know who the richest superhero is in the entire marvel universe ?
18287,is it tony stark ?
18288,"haha so tony stark is actually the second richest , the first richest marvel superhero is actually the black panther , and then i guess bruce wayne who is batman is in third with 80 billion dollars"
18289,oh wow ! how was he supposed to have made his money ?
18290,"yeah i think if i remember correctly , they just have a lot of advanced technology in the country that the black panther lives in , and he just has a ton of money for some reason , he has 500 billion dollars and tony stark has ' only ' 100 billion dollars haha ."
18291,"interesting , but they don't specifically say what he does ?"
18292,"no , like i said i think it's just he has a lot of technology and they sell the technology or something like that , i guess you should see the movie maybe you'll catch something that i didn't lol . what is cool about the movies though is that they use real ancient writings for it ."
18293,interesting . will do . do you know if there is a comic book movie that accompanies the movie ?
18294,"yes there is a comic book . it's actually pretty old . and whenever i think of the word black panther , i think of the political party , but apparently the comic book came out before that"
18295,"well apparently dc comics paid 130 for exclusive rights to superman , i wonder how much for black panther ?"
18296,that's a good question . do you like marvel comics by the way ? or do you prefer dc . i mostly prefer marvel myself
18297,"i don't have a preference , but apparently mj tried to buy marvel in the early 1990s ."
18298,"wow that's cool . when you say mj , do you mean michael jackson ? that would have been really crazy . i think it's interesting that marvel and dc both own a character , and his name is access , and it's only purpose is to keep both universes separate"
18299,"yeah , the king of pop . he apparently tried to buy them so he could play spiderman in his own produced movie ."
18300,that sounds awesome ! i wish we could have had that haha . do you like sony pictures by the way ? apparently they had the chance to buy all of the marvel characters for only 25 million dollars back in 1998
18301,"i do , i can believe that . that was a mistake , but then again nobody knew that these types of movies would blow up the way they did ."
18302,"no i agree with you . and that's why sony only has the rights to spiderman , they bought it for 10 million dollars , and i thought that was the only superhero anyone would ever want to see"
18303,good morning ! are you into superhero movies ?
18304,"yes , i am . did you watch ' black panther ' ?"
18305,i did ! i can't believe it won a lot of oscars ! he's considered the richest superhero .
18306,"yes , indeed . i do like letitia wright as shuri in ' black panther ' . she also said in her interviews that one of her character will inspire girls to pursue stem subjects ."
18307,that is such an awesome thing to say ! i wonder where chadwick boseman would be if denzel washington didn't pay for his school ?
18308,"good question also writer reginald hudlin told the washington posts' comic riffs ' that's everyone should be a black panther , its not just for boys ."
18309,well said ! do you like marvel or dc comics more ?
18310,hard to chose . but i do really like that ' black panther ' also teaches women how to show up for themselves in life and love . you should really watch it .
18311,it is such a great movie ! the name black panther actually predates the group !
18312,"yes i know . by the way the richest superhero is black panther , who has an estimated of 500 billion . , whereas bruce wayne 80 billion ."
18313,"i thought tony stark would be , but he's poor compared to him at 100 billion dollars lol ."
18314,"yes , agree . it is hard to believe that marvel in 1998 . offered the cinematic rights for almost all of its characters to sony for a mere 25 million , sony rejected the offer , wrong move ."
18315,i bet they kick themselves in the butt everytime they see how much a movie makes lol . have you ever heard of the superhero access ?
18316,"no . you , know it is interesting that the largest comic book market is japan , but of course ."
18317,i did not know that ! it's good that the largest public collection is here in america though !
18318,"yes , i do agree . by the way the michigan state university library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world ."
18319,i was wondering who actually had it ! i think marvel did it great when they published a generic comic book to trademarks certain words and titles .
18320,yes . you know one of my favorite comic book legends stan lee ends every phone conversation he has with the word ' excelsior ! ' .
18321,i would have loved to chat with that guy before he passed ! he did a good job with marvel lobbying that mutants are not people thus paying a lower rate to sell toys lol .
18322,"yes , i know . also marvel published a 'generic comic book' , in order to trademark the names ' super hero ' and ' supervillain ' , they better ."
18323,"that is very interesting ! it was awesome chatting with you , have a great day !"
18324,good morning ! do you have a favorite superhero or comic book ?
18325,my favorite is superman
18326,did you know that the dc from dc comics stands for detective comics ?
18327,"i didn't know that , i wasn't sure what it stood for ."
18328,marvel once published a generic comic book so they could trademark the names ' super hero ' and ' super villain ' .
18329,that's some interesting information .
18330,i thought so too ! michigan state university has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world . never would have guessed that .
18331,"yea , i would have never guess that a university would have that many comics . cool !"
18332,"stan lee , who recently passed away always ended his phone conversations with the word ' excelsior ! ' that's an interesting . must be from one of his comic books ?"
18333,"yea , it must have been . guess he needed a catchphrase"
18334,lol yes . there was a garfield spinoff series named pet force . i don't remember that . it featured him and the other characters as superheroes .
18335,yeah i never heard of that one before . i loved garfield .
18336,me too . did you know that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the u . s . ?
18337,"i did not know that , interesting"
18338,yes . i thought so too . comic books were first popularized in the u . s . in the 1930's . i bet those original ones go for big money now .
18339,"i knew they've been around a long time , but didn't know they were that old . you are correct , i bet the old ones are worth big money ."
18340,did you know that supereroine is another word for a female superhero ?
18341,"i did know that , i've heard that before ."
18342,there once was a superhero called normalman and he didn't have any superpowers . that's funny !
18343,"yeah that is funny , the only guy who isn't special is made out to be special ."
18344,i agree ! lol it was nice chatting with you today !
18345,i would really love to hold a star . it is amazing there are some cold enough to hold .
18346,the universe is amazing in its vastness .
18347,"yes , and to think it may be one giant superhologram is just beyond my comprehension ."
18348,i think that is a rather silly hypothesis posited by someone in need of research grant money and running out of ideas .
18349,very likely . i wonder if one of the over 300 registered superheroes in the usa could intervene ? !
18350,have you ever seen that show on sci fi where they show real life superheroes around the world ? it is fascinating .
18351,"no , i have not and usually i'm not a scifi fan but i'll have to fish that up , along with the garfield spin off where he was a superhero ."
18352,it is sad that we lost stan lee this last year . he was a great artist
18353,i agree . the creativity he took with him is one that i fear humanity is losing . arts and imagination off the internet seems to be something society is rapidly erasing .
18354,comic books were originally supposed to just be funny but i think they have evolved into so much more even giving us hope in a time when things look bleak . we need more of that not less
18355,absolutely . i wonder how accessible michigan state university's largest publicly available comic book collection in the world really is . that sounds like some bit of useless info i should have already heard by now .
18356,very true . i'm surprised that it is in michigan of all places . i would have though new york or la . i find it amusing that dc comics is redundant since most of their character names are the same letter for first and last
18357,"yeah , michigan . woo hoo . i'm freezing where i am now far south of there and am serious about digging into things i can watch this weekend amid lousy weather ! there is actually a superhero called ' normalman . ' he was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes . i think i need a desk plaque that reads ' normalwoman ' after learning that ."
18358,i think more people should be proud to be normalheroes and the world would be a happier place .
18359,yeah . . . you've got a point . my dog is a normaldoggo but he sure is happy lol .
18360,that's funny . if only people were as loyal as our pets . imagine the things we could accomplish
18361,"i think society is so far engrossed with the internet rather than legitimate human interaction it's killing our ability to be decent humans to each other . we're sitting here in the office now looking at the mess in germany unfolding and it's insane to think we , as a species , kinda stalled around the 1950's . comic books were first popularized in the united states and the united kingdom during the 1930s . what an amazing time that must have been to be alive"
18362,talking with people who lived during those times is amazing . we think of our problems as something that has only happened here and now to but to listen to the stories of those times it is amazing what our grandparents and great grandparents lived through . you can see it in the art and literature of the time as well .
18363,"that is very true . comic book legend stan lee ends every phone conversation he has with the word ' excelsior ! ' so in honor of this chat , i gotta end it with that ! it was nice talking to you . and remember , there are still some good ' normalheroes ' left out here ! : d"
18364,to all of us normalheroes ! may we not be overtaken by the media and making us try and conform !
18365,yes ! hashtag maga
18366,hope you find the garfield series . it is very enjoyable .
18367,hey there have you seen the movie the black panther ? it came out in 2018
18368,i have it's a really good movie . i really liked letitia wright's role as shuri . she was excellent .
18369,she did a good job . so did chadwick boseman . i didn't know the black panther is the wealthiest fictional marvel universe character
18370,i didn't realize that either . i figured tony stark would have been richer .
18371,"yep that's what i would have thought , the black panther is worth about 500 billion , iron man is worth about 100 billion , and bruce wayne is worth about 80 billion"
18372,did you know that marvel's use of the name actually predates the founding of the black panther party ?
18373,"i always wondered where that came from . and i guess they also tried changing the name of the character for a while so that it wasn't associated with that group , but that didn't work obviously haha"
18374,"yeah they had changed it to ' black leopard , ' that just doesn't seem as fitting as black panther ."
18375,"nope it doesn't sound as good , it's pretty cool that denzel washington helped out chadwick boseman back in the day , and then chadwick gave him a shoutout at the premiere"
18376,that is pretty cool . did you know that the symbols and written script featured in the movie are based on an actual script called nsibdi ?
18377,"wow that's good attention to detail , marvel comics is interesting though . back in 1998 they were trying to sell all of their characters to sony for only 25 million dollars , sony thought that was a bad idea because no one cared about any other character but spiderman , and they only got spiderman for 10 million , they must be kicking themselves now haha"
18378,"oh wow , that was a bad move on sony's part . i learned that they successfully argued in court that mutants are not people and thus got to pay the lower rate on xmen ' toys ' instead of the higher rate for dolls ."
18379,oh interesting . so that was what was going on with that . do you know the backstory of the superhero blue ear by chance ?
18380,yeah i heard about that . it was a very sweet thing they did for a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing his hearing aids . he told his mom that ' superheroes don't wear hearing aids ' so marvel created one .
18381,"yep that is super nice of them i think . isn't it weird that in mississippi , disney does not own the rights to show the big marvel characters like xmen and spiderman , apparently they have a custom contract with universal studios in that specific state"
18382,"it's actually parks east of the mississippi , so i'm guessing mostly disney world in orlando ."
18383,"i must have read that wrong lol , do you like dc comics or marvel comics more by the way ? personally i like batman from dc , but the rest i am all marvel"
18384,"i'm more of a marvel fan , but i do like a few dc characters though ."
18385,yep i agree with you there . is that funny that marvel published a ' generic comic book ' so that they could trademark the terms superhero and supervillain
18386,"that's pretty interesting . did you know that dc stands for detective comics , so there name is detective comic comics , kind of redundant huh ?"
18387,"haha that is very redundant . do you know who stan lee was ? anyway he was a big marvel book creator , and would always end every phone conversation with the word ' excelsior '"
18388,good morning ! do you read comic books ?
18389,"good morning , no not really . do you ?"
18390,every now and then i do . i like marvel and some dc . it seems so bizarre to think that the first comics in the country back in 1933 were just funny and not super hero ones .
18391,"i guess everything evolves , eventually . interesting note , i did read that michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics so he could play spiderman in his own movie ."
18392,really ? that would have been interesting . i wonder if he would have put dance scenes in the movie !
18393,"i'm sure he would have , no doubt ! just found out today that google had purchased gmail . com from the garfield comics ! did you know that ?"
18394,"no i didn't . i used to read garfield but i don't remember any gmail in it . then again , i don't remember much more than garfield and lasagna !"
18395,"i always thought gmail stood for google mail ? lol . talk about a good deal , i hear that dc comics paid 130 for superman in 1938 ."
18396,i thought it did too btw . so are you saying that dc owned spiderman at one time ?
18397,"so , it would seem ? who knows marvel comics spent a decade trying to prove to the government that the xmen were not real . it's a wacky universe , we love in !"
18398,yes it is ! marvel published a generic comic book of sorts at one time . they did that so they could trademark the names sueprhero and supervillain .
18399,that was super smart of them to do that ! i know the love for the super hero universe is big . did you know that at least 30 movies with super heroes will be released between 2016 and 2020 ?
18400,i hadn't realized there would be so many ! marvel takes their movies to a different super hero universe than in the comics . i guess that's how they can make the story lines different in both and keep things going .
18401,"speaking of the universe , do you know our universe used to be completely opaque ?"
18402,"no i didn't . so our universe used to look like fog , or thick white clouds ?"
18403,"yes , apparently , there was so much plasma that the light couldn't get through . don't ask me how the scientists determined this fact !"
18404,lol ! i won't but i do wonder ! scientists have some strange ideas some times . i've heard that there are some that think our universe is just one giant hologram .
18405,"i've heard that one , as well as that the universe exists inside a black hole or that a cold spot in the cosmic radiation could be an indication that it is a link to a parallel universe . i don't know how they come up with these theories . it's above my pay grade ."
18406,mine too . have you heard the one about there being only one electron in the universe ?
18407,"yes , i've heard that crazy one , as well . but , then again , everybody used to think the world was flat !"
18408,so true ! there are still people that believe that one . i'm going to go do some more research and see what other theories about the universe there are ! it's been nice chatting with you ! have a great day !
18409,hello . what do you think of some scientists who think the universe may be a giant superhologram ? that sounds so crazy to me .
18410,"yes , it does . something else that is crazy , is that there are stars that are cold enough to be touched by the human hand ."
18411,that would be so fun to do . even though i don't believe the theory that states there is only one electron in the universe .
18412,there has been so many theories about the universe and its origins . i wonder if humans will eventually find the answers . i have my doubts if we will ever get all the answers .
18413,"i don't think we will , not in our lifetime . did you know there are over 300 superheroes in the us , alone ? i love the mcu ."
18414,yes i did . do you know about normal man ? he is the only normal person on a planet full of superheroes .
18415,"was there , i didn't know . i recently found out that dc stands for detective comics . who knew ?"
18416,i loved garfield as a kid . i found out recently he has a series where he and his friends are superheroes .
18417,"garfield is hilarious . his comics are even in the michigan university library , they have the largest comic book collection in the world ."
18418,wow ! sounds like i should take a road trip to michigan ! do you know how many comic books they have there ?
18419,"i don't know . i haven't been to that campus . its funny that marvel published a generic comic book , so they could trademark ' super hero ' and ' super villain ' ."
18420,that doesn't sound fair to trademark those words because they seem very commonly used words .
18421,"i guess the government felt differently . stan lee ends each phone call with excelsior , and his tweets as well . i miss him ."
18422,he was a true legend in his field . he even reimagined classics like batman and superman
18423,i remember that . he did a better job than their original creators .
18424,i was surprised to learn recently that the american comics only has roughly 10 percent of the world market .
18425,did you hear about the controversy over an actor playing batwoman ? they were trashing her because she isn't ' gay enough ' . i never knew batwoman was a lesbian .
18426,"wow , i did not know that either . i don't see what the big deal is , i mean you can always have different actors with different interpretations of the same character . it makes it more interesting ."
18427,the actress is a lesbian though . she came out at 12 . people are so weird .
18428,a lot of people are social justice warriors who feel that their viewpoint is always the right viewpoint . they want to be right instead of getting it right .
18429,"its a weird thing to harass an openly gay actor about . thanks for the chat , have a wonderful night ."
18430,"you too , bye"
18431,have you heard of the movie ' venom ' it was directed by a guy who got influenced by seeing batman .
18432,i have heard of it but haven't seen it . didn't venom come from spiderman ?
18433,"i am not sure . it sounds like once he got into movies , he began as an assistant on dawson's creek and met michelle williams . he also was directed the hit ' zombieland '"
18434,interesting . i think michelle williams was in dawson's creek and it seems like i've heard she's in venom too .
18435,i don't know all of the superheroes but there is a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by the superheroes .
18436,yeah ? that would be cool to see in a movie . they could make it a comedy of sorts . speaking of superheroes did you know that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states ?
18437,"no i didn't until now . as a funny twist , there is a ' normalman ' superhero with no powers on a planet full of superheroes with powers !"
18438,that would be funny ! it would make a good movie too ! seems like i heard that all of this superhero stuff started back in the 1930s .
18439,that is true . stan lee created 15 dc comics . he recently pasted away so he did live to see them made into movies .
18440,"that's good that he lived long enough to see that . you know , i remember watching the batman movie that had michael keaton as batman . it was really good and he was great . did you know that he wouldn't do a sequel ?"
18441,i did not know that . i know at the time people gave him a lot of flack about the role . did you know that the dark knight with christian bale earned over a billion dollars when added with the sequel ?
18442,"no , i had no idea . imagine how good michael keaton's could have done if he had a sequel then there probably would have been a theme park at universal studios for batman ."
18443,george clooney and val kilmer also played batman in other batman movies
18444,"yes they did . say , did you know that there were plans to make the green lantern into a comedy ?"
18445,i didn't know that . smallville was originally meant to tell the story of how bruce wayne becomes batman .
18446,really ? i've seen a few episodes of smallville . i thought it was good . i think that russia has a version of batman too .
18447,"speaking of comedies , did you know that 3rd rock from the sun won the golden globe for best comedy in 1997 ? it beat out seinfeld , friends , and frasier !"
18448,"wow ! that's impressive ! those are all really good shows ! comedy must be hard to do and be successful at . i mean , comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since it began ."
18449,i also did not know that comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows .
18450,"it is pretty surprising . i wonder if they were all the same type . i mean , i've heard that there are different types of comedy ."
18451,i also like that the creator of the python programming language was named to honor the monty python comedy group . . . nice speaking with you .
18452,that's really cool to know ! nice speaking with you too !
18453,have you seen the musical ' chess ' ? it is playing at the kennedy center and has an amazing cast .
18454,i don't think i've ever heard of it . what is it about ?
18455,i think it has something to do with the cold war . it is set between 1972 and 1979 .
18456,that seems pretty interesting . speaking of chess do you know how to play ?
18457,"i know the rules but i haven't played in many years . i don't recognize any of the songs from chess but , since it has parts about the kgb and cia , it is a cold war thing . . ."
18458,"yeah , maybe a bit before my time . did you know there are possible moves in chess than there are atoms in the world . that blows my mind ."
18459,i find that really hard to believe . the musical chess lasts 2 hours and 50 minutes . i'm not sure i want to believe that .
18460,that seems like a ridiculously long time . i would definitely need a break between that one !
18461,that and a few drinks . . . i respect chess masters but i find the game rather boring . i would rather play backgammon it moves faster .
18462,it is definitely a slow game . did you know the president of the federation of chess believes it was invented by aliens ?
18463,for real ? that's weird . . . did you know linkin park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone ? hard working people . . .
18464,"wow , that means they were doing almost one a day . crazy ! the ramones have played a total of 2263 concerts . they toured almost non stop for 20 years !"
18465,that must be the inspiration for their song ' i want to be sedated ' .
18466,lol ! you might be right ! in 2002 a creed concert went so bad that 4 concert goers filed a lawsuit . i wonder how bad it must have been . .
18467,that's pretty bad unless they were playing for a law school or something . did you know that r . reagan was the only president that was elected after being divorced ? i didn't . . .
18468,i didn't know that either . hasn't donald trump been divorced ?
18469,i think so . the article i read must be dated . i did learn that 6 of 15 presidents were lefthanded . reagan was ambidextrous .
18470,that's pretty interesting . ronald reagan established national ice cream month !
18471,that's pretty cool but i think many would disagree with him saying ice cream is nutritious .
18472,"yeah , that's probably not entirely true . he also won 49 out of 50 states !"
18473,that was quite a victory . thanks for the chat !
18474,hi do you like chess ?
18475,i have not seen it but would like to i hear its a great cold war rock musical
18476,"yeah , how about the game of chess ?"
18477,i do like to play from time to time my son got a merit badge in the boy scouts in chess
18478,wow that is amazing . did you know there are more possible moves in chess than atoms in the universe
18479,wow that seems pretty insane . i would like to play 3 person chess that sounds like a lot of fun
18480,wow did not know there is such a thing . the president of the federation believes that chess was invented by aliens
18481,that is pretty weird . i did enjoy watching a magician beat 9 leading chess players simultaneously by replicating their moves against each other at each table !
18482,wow . judit polgar was so good at it that he beat a family friend at the game when he was 5 and did not even look at the board
18483,that is seriously impressive . i am just happy to know how the pieces move and that a knight can visit each square exactly once
18484,yeah . did you know there is a negative correlation between the iq and chess skills ?
18485,really ? i would have thought you needed to be pretty smart to play chess ! but maybe not since pawns no longer have their own names like they used to
18486,yeah . i guess so . do you know where the game was invented ?
18487,india i believe and it became more modern in spain in the 1400s
18488,yes it was india during the gupta empire and it was improved by the persians later
18489,the rules however were not standardized until the 19th century
18490,"yeah . on another topic , do you go to concerts a lot ?"
18491,i do like some concerts i like the foo fighters but their concerts have been so loud it shows up on seismic monitors !
18492,yeah that is crazy . did you know linkin park played 324 concerts in 2001 ?
18493,wow that is insane . dave matthews got lucky once he was stranded and a woman who was going to his concert stopped to help him
18494,wow that is nice that she stopped and she also met the guy in person
18495,yes good deeds are always a good thing !
18496,"hello , have you seen frozen ?"
18497,yes i have i thought that was a great movie . it won two academy awards . there's going to be a sequel !
18498,it's a very good movie . my daughter is super excited for the sequel .
18499,awesome me too . before let it go was written elsa was actually the main villain in frozen .
18500,oh wow i didn't know that . the director is the first female director of a walt disney feature film .
18501,such a fitting film to do that . disney renamed rapunzel to tangled and snow queen to frozen because they blamed feminine titles for underperforming at box offices .
18502,interesting . . . i didn't know that either . i saw it was the 53rd disney animated film .
18503,that's a lot of animated films . frozen reminds me of hockey because of the ice . canada is the only country in the world with two national sports : lacrosse and ice hockey .
18504,that's pretty cool . i love lacrosse . i played that in high school .
18505,oh nice . do you like ice hockey ? an ice hockey ring remains under basketball court when switching stadium sports !
18506,i love ice hockey too . that's pretty cool . who's your favorite nhl team ?
18507,i like the chicago blackhawks . did you know that an average hockey player will lose up to 8 pounds in one game ? that's a lot of sweat .
18508,i'm a blue jackets fan . that's a good method for losing weight lol
18509,awesome . hockey player was treated for 1 in1993 . that is kind of demeaning .
18510,that's very demeaning . looks like he went on to win 4 stanley cups though so good for him .
18511,yes he really proved them wrong . must've been good motivation . are you a soccer fan as well ? it seems make the most money out of any sport .
18512,i love soccer as well . i saw it makes more than all other sports combined which is nuts .
18513,yes it is played by so many people . more than 250 million players worldwide .
18514,very cool . i didn't know jon stewart was a very skilled soccer player .
18515,yes i had no idea he played at the pan american maccabi games in brazil .
18516,me either . good chatting with you . have a good day .
18517,"hello , did you know that tom hanks is the highest paid all time star , over 8 . 5 million earned from movies ?"
18518,no i did not ! did you see juneau's overtime goal in game 6 ?
18519,"nope , what sport is juneau in ?"
18520,hockey
18521,"oh , that's why i didn't know . i'm more of a football girl ! i hear that in tennis , venus and her sister serena played opposite each other in the mixed doubles final of the french open . bet that was hard for them to try and beat each other !"
18522,"i'm a football guy too ! : , can't believe the washinton capitals didn't win a stanley cup till 1998 ?"
18523,"yes , true . here's a interesting fact . . . . the highest point on the moon is 1938 meters higher than mt . everest . that's incredible actually !"
18524,wow ! that is ? what else is incredible is the russians made a computer that ran on water !
18525,"that's insane , doesn't even sound possible , actually sounds a little dangerous . . . ya know . . . . water and electricity !"
18526,would you want to upload your mind to a memory stick ?
18527,"i was just thinking about how crazy that is ! ! ha ha . also ya better watch out for the ' apple police ' cuz smoking near your apple computer voids their warranty , making it a biohazard , ha !"
18528,lol . . . that is funny ! do you own a apple computer ?
18529,"no , i'm more of an android user on my cell and a windows or chrome user . how about you ?"
18530,i love apple . . . very simple and awesome customer support !
18531,"the reason i don't prefer apple is the simplicity . i do have an iphone 5 , because i used to only use apple , it just seems that the android has a little more to offer as far as what i want and need my cell phone to do i guess . i really could go either way , the apple products are definitely the best quality . my family all has apple products ."
18532,you're a rebel . . . heheee ! good thing computers are used for consumer and indestrial use !
18533,"funny ! i see that someone built an actual working 16 bit computer using minecraft building blocks , bet me nephew could do that !"
18534,oh minecraft . . . i bet you play that game ! lmao ! ! !
18535,did you know that the movie ' silence of the lambs ' opened at theaters on valentines day in 1991 ' creepy . . . . .
18536,hahaaa ! that's awesome ! crazy disney thought about closing their animation dept
18537,"true , can't even imagine them doing that , disney and animation go hand in hand !"
18538,hi there ! are you a hockey fan ?
18539,not too much although i like it better than football . are you ?
18540,"it's ok to watch if it's on but i don't go out of my way for it . an average pro hockey player will lose up to 8 pounds a game . if i had known that though when i was younger , i would have played . lol"
18541,i played field hockey in high school . it was tough .
18542,nice ! that was never popular where i live . an interesting tidbit though . . . i was on a native american reservation this past summer in new york and i learned that field hockey originated as a native sport !
18543,"that is interesting ! a player caught fire when a puck hit his matches in his pocket . that was ice hockey , though . i hate to skate because i fell on the back of my head once ."
18544,"i tried ice skating and couldn't get the hang of it . that had to have hurt . in the first olympic winter games in 1924 , canada scored 132 goals and let in only 3 during the entire competition !"
18545,ice hockey is very competitive . you have to have strong ankles and a thick skull . and you can get cut by someone else's blades . that's the worst . i prefer skiing .
18546,i agree . canada is the only country with 2 national sports lacrosse and ice hockey .
18547,i have never seen lacrosse ! i like to watch the ice dancers when the olympics are on . i like that the brazilian bobsled team is called frozen bananas .
18548,that's funny ! hahha this might sound silly but what is the difference between lacrosse and field hockey ?
18549,i have no idea actually . did you ever watch curling ? they use brooms to move weights across the ice . i think it is popular in maine and canada .
18550,i've seen that on the olympics . funny you say maine i had cousins there when i was growing up . we went there to visit them and that was the first time i ever saw field hockey and was shocked that it was a school sport . lol
18551,"they made us play field hockey , whether you wanted to or not . i am from massachusetts . we did play soccer too ."
18552,nice ! have cousins there . . . my grandmother was from cambridge and i have cousins still in the woburn area . can't remember the exact town names . lol
18553,"haha . i have friends in 'wooburn . ' growing up , i liked being out in the woods sksting on a pond as opposed to a rink . i don't think i have ever skated in a rink ."
18554,haha like the accents . i remember when i first went there i asked for a pop and no one knew what i was talking about . they called it tonic . lol do they still call it that ?
18555,some people do . i call it soda . i lived in miami for a while and i called the water fountain a bubbler . everyone made fun of me .
18556,ha ! that's awesome ! i'm going to have to remember that next time i see one . so since you play soccer . . . did you know that soccer makes more money than all of the other big sports combined ?
18557,i read that . i guess its because the game is universal . i like it better than hockey because the boston bruins seem to only want to fight with the other teams .
18558,lol a hockey player was traded for 1 in 1993 and went on to win 4 stanley cups . wonder who that it is . lol i just went by my son turned on the water in the sink and said ' look at the bubbla ' he looked at me like something was wrong with me and didn't say nothing . . . just walked away shaking his head .
18559,"haha that's funny . well , nice chatting with you . enjoy your pop !"
18560,"lol have a nice day : ,"
18561,"hello , were you aware that elsa was originally a villain in frozen ?"
18562,"no , that's sounds odd . did you know frozen was originally named snow queen but it was changed due to the belief that feminine titles under performed"
18563,"it does sound weird , though it was only after let it go was wrote , that they changed her character . that sounds like something disney would do ."
18564,"yea , i don't think frozen would have made 1 billion if they kept her a villain"
18565,"honestly , i've never seen it . i've never seen wreckit ralph either ."
18566,i haven't seen it either but it's pretty cool alan tudyk has had roles in every disney animated film since wreck it ralph
18567,"that is cool , i liked his character in zootopia ."
18568,i find it pretty cool robert lopez did work for south park before writing for frozen
18569,"i knew he cowrote the book of mormon , but i didn't know about south park ."
18570,"yea , lopez has wrote a lot of songs , he even wrote for an episode of scrubs"
18571,"i think he won an egot for the scrubs episode , i don't remember correctly though ."
18572,"lopez is pretty talented , he has won an egot , emmy , grammy , oscar , and tony !"
18573,i don't think john legend has won all of those . have you seen avenue q or
18574,no but i heard lopez did a great job on it and book of mormon too
18575,do you follow hockey ? i hear they can lose almost 8 pounds per game .
18576,"yea , i bet most of the 8 pounds of weight hockey players lose is mostly from sweat"
18577,that is a lot of water weight . do all stadiums have a hockey ring under their basketball courts ?
18578,"no , just ones that have a basketball and hockey team sharing the arena like madison square garden does with the knicks and rangers"
18579,"does america have professional lacrosse teams ? canada does , its one of their national sports ."
18580,i think there is a professional lacrosse league but it is nowhere near as popular of known as lacrosse is in canada
18581,"do you know what bandy is ? i've never heard of it , i guess it's a form of hockey ."
18582,"no clue . well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
18583,"hi , do you like movies ?"
18584,"hi ! yes , i love movies . in fact , tom hanks is one of my favorite actors . did you know he's also the highest box office star of all time , making over 8 . 5 billion worldwide ?"
18585,that's a lot of money ! do you like disney movies too ?
18586,"i do love disney movies . you know , when sleeping beauty flopped at the box office , they almost shut down their entire animation studio . i'm so thankful they didn't !"
18587,i know . we would have been robbed of so many great movies . they did flop with treasure planet though .
18588,i wonder if it was as bad as trojan wars ? it only earned 309 at the box office despite having a budget of 15 million . that's kind of depressing .
18589,yeah . imagine being the lead on that and get those reviews and results back . so depressing !
18590,"no kidding ! i kind of wish they'd make a movie about that computer the russians made back in 1936 that ran on water . that is crazy , isn't it ?"
18591,"yeah , like a space shuttle running on only 1mb of ram !"
18592,that would be interesting as well ! i think the best horror movie would be about those transhumanist people who wish to upload their minds to memory sticks and computers . ha !
18593,right ? i don't want your brain on a stick . . . do you smoke ?
18594,"no kidding ! ha ! if i did smoke , i wouldn't want to do it around apple computers because it makes them a biohazard and voids the warranty ."
18595,that's right ! but don't smoke regardless . . . it's gross . could you build a working computer out of minecraft blocks ?
18596,"i wish i could but i'm not as brilliant as the person who did that . i'd rather just build a space ship and go to the moon . ha ! speaking of the moon , did you know there's actually evidence of methane based life on one of saturn's moons named titan ?"
18597,"no , i did not . that's really interesting . mar's moon , phobos is 1 or 3 hollow ."
18598,thats pretty interesting ! i also find it interesting that highest point on our moon is 1938 meters higher than mt . everest . i'm surprised no one's tried to climb it yet . ha !
18599,yeah . it would probably be easier . . . with no gravity . . . . you could also look down on the people who only climbed everest . . . .
18600,exactly . ha ! i'd just fear being hit by moon dust as it can cut through kevlarlike material and cause the moon hay fever disease . so i would have to pass on climbing the moon's highest point .
18601,what if it gave you super powers though . . . like the ability to jump really high ?
18602,"that would be cool . ha ! well speaking of the moon , did you also know nasa had considered placing a un flag on the moon instead of the us flag , months before apollo 11 ?"
18603,i did not know that . i hope you have a great day . nice chatting with you !
18604,hey there have you ever played chess ? i used to be really good at it when i was younger
18605,"oh , yes ! i love chess . have you ever played with the board that allows 3 people ? that seems intense ."
18606,"no i never played that ! but it sounds pretty awesome lol . it's also awesome that there are more possible moves in chess than there are atoms in the universe , that seems insane"
18607,"wow , that is so crazy . i can't believe chess has been around since before the 7th century , either . what a rich history !"
18608,"that is a long time ! did you ever play by the way ? apparently the rules were standardized in the 19th century , even though like you mentioned , it has existed in some way or another since the 7th"
18609,i have played . i love most strategy games like chess and mah jong . but i'm definitely no darren brown .
18610,"can you tell me about darren brown ? all i know about chess is that people like bobby fischer are good , also judit pulgar is really good too , i bought one of her books when i was studying chest"
18611,darren brown was actually a magician ! he beat nine of the best chess players in existence at the same time by replicating each of their moves against each other in every game .
18612,"wow that's incredible ! he sounds really good . on a separate note though , what do you think about concerts ? do you ever go to them ?"
18613,i love concerts . i saw depeche mode recently . i've also seen dave matthews .
18614,"oh yeah those are both really good . i really liked lollapalooza which was a big music festival or concert that i went to last year . i also like the ramones , did you know that they have been touring nonstop for 20 years ?"
18615,"woah , that's super cool . they play pretty loudly , too . i wonder if they play as loud as deep purple . in 1972 , three audience members passed out from the sound . they broke the world record !"
18616,"that's scary ! i would have hated that concert because i hate really loud music personally even though i do go to concerts lol . i would go to the amphitheater in croatia though , they were probably be respectful with sound there"
18617,"if you don't like loud concerts , you probably would've loved the one lou reed had in 2010 . him and his wife held one for dogs , so the music was only a high frequency that they could hear ."
18618,"yeah i would have loved that haha ! that way i couldn't have heard anything lol . i also would not have liked to go to that creed concert , you know , the one where they were sued because the concert was so bad lol"
18619,"i haven't heard about that , but i could believe it ! speaking of people who weren't appreciated , did you know that ronald reagan lost a movie job because the producer didn't think he looked ' presidential ' . talk about irony !"
18620,"wow talk about a bad call lol . it's interesting too , that he is the only president to be elected after previously being divorced . i wonder why that is"
18621,and that people voted for him ! he was the original flipflopper considering he began his career as a democrat !
18622,"you're right ! i think it's awesome though that he called ice cream ' a nutritious and wholesome food ' and created national ice cream month , now that's something i can get behind haha"
18623,he must've had a tremendous sweet tooth . apparently jelly belly created the blueberry flavor just for him .
18624,"that's awesome ! i wish i had someone to make a jelly bean flavor after me lol . it's interesting to that he was ambidextrous , you don't meet many people that are"
18625,"what do you think about the cast of chess , ?"
18626,i actually haven't seen it . have you ?
18627,"i havent seen it either but i am exited , i think murray head has a lot of talent and the eisenhower theater is also amazing ."
18628,i really like the game of chess ? do you play ? did you know there are more possible moves in a game of chess than there are atoms in the known universe
18629,"really ! ! that many ? wow , countless of strategies then , i dont play but have respect for those who do , it looks hard ."
18630,it can be depending on your partner . there is so much to think about so many options so many moves . chess was invented in india
18631,is it true the president of the chess federation thinks the game was invented by aliens ?
18632,"haha i have no clue , i guess it wouldnt surprise me . i wonder why he thinks that or what evidence he has to support that theory ."
18633,"maybe because of the complexity of the game , there is also an iq correlation with strong chess players ."
18634,i am sure . grandmaster judit polgar beat a 5 year old without looking at the board .
18635,"thats crazy , he had a memorized strategy , so do you like music , have you attended any concerts lately ?"
18636,"i do like music . i havent been to any concerts lately though , have you ?"
18637,"i havent been to any concerts lately either , i sure want to go to a ramones concert , even though they played a total of 2263 concerts i wasnt able to go to one ."
18638,"that is a ton of concerts , i cant imagine living out of suitcases for so long , they must have loved it ! hope they made a lot of money !"
18639,"they might , they are a pretty good band , i also wanted to attend a linking park concert but that seems impossible now ."
18640,"yeah linkin park did 324 concerts one year ! they were a great band , i wish i couldve saw them too ."
18641,"yeah , their debut album was great i really liked it , another band i used to like was creed ."
18642,i dont think i know who they are . any good ? what are some of their songs ?
18643,"some of their best songs are ' my sacrifice ' and ' higher ' you should look them up , too bad the band started having problems , in 2002 they gave a concert that wasn't up to their usual standards ."
18644,"oh right , their fans filed a lawsuit , that is unfortunate . must have been really bad !"
18645,"yeah , i wonder why because they have pretty good songs maybe the band was out of tune and didnt rehearse properly ."
18646,do you play chess
18647,i used to when i was younger . it is a pretty strategic game and i am impressed by people that play it professionally .
18648,i always wanted to play in the park of nyc
18649,i have always seen that on tv and in movies . that would be fun . i wonder if they have the version of chess that allows 3 players to play against each other .
18650,i don't think so because of how the board is built .
18651,did you know that chess is thought to have originated out of a game that was played in india ? i never would have thought that .
18652,there were many games that were derivative from the indian game of chaturanga
18653,oh really ? do you know what those other games were ?
18654,i think one was janggi and the other shogi
18655,"wow , i have heard of those games . i can't believe chess has been played in europe since the 9th century ."
18656,the number of possible moves makes it very difficult to master
18657,"yep , and in chess the knight can only visit each square once during a game ."
18658,i believe the world press president is a bit crazy .
18659,why do you say that ?
18660,he believes the game was invented by aliens rather than indians
18661,"wow , that is crazy ."
18662,the current grandmaster has been playing since he was 5
18663,"wow . i never would have thought they started that young . however the boy scouts have a merit badge for chess now , so i guess youngsters do play regularly ."
18664,i did not realize that . that is great for the boy scouts since they are known for their outdoor type activities .
18665,"they also have merit badges for geocaching , robotics , and inventing . it is nice to see them branching out to include kids with all kinds of interests ."
18666,i will have to look it up . i used to be a boy scout and don't remember all those badge .
18667,do you like movies ?
18668,"yeah , doesn't everybody ."
18669,the real question is do you like horror ?
18670,never really been a big fan of horror movies . how about you ?
18671,i find it a hit or miss . it is interesting you can burn up to 180 calories by watching horror movies
18672,thats crazy maybe i need to start watching more horror movies . lol . maybe i can lose a few pounds .
18673,did you know that creepy reverberating metallic noise is created by a waterphone ?
18674,i had no idea what that even is to be honest with you . i did hear that watching a horror film before viewing abstract art will make you enjoy the art more . crazy huh .
18675,the waterphone is kind of like a ton of tuning forks attached to a circular ring that vibrates as you play the tongs
18676,oh thats good to know . so im guessing they use that to make the noises in the horror films .
18677,ya but i feel horror is subjective . the actor in the shinning didn't know he was in a horror film until several years later
18678,"that is true . when i was a kid they scared me , now i find most of them either just stupid or funny , instead of scary ."
18679,"i never thought of bambi as a horror film , but i see stephen king's point since if not animated , the film is quite dark"
18680,i guess when they shot the momma deer it was kind of dark . the rest of it doesn't really seem too bad . i guess it has been a long time since i have seen it though .
18681,i mean the bird kind of made it better . generally disney use bird and cute animals to bring a lighter tone to movies also like in sleeping beauty
18682,to think about it that makes a lot of sense . i guess birds just have a way of making people feel better .
18683,"they have a beautiful voice , but sometime they can mimic sounds of car alarms and chainsaws . if you heard any such sounds randomly in australia , it is probably just birds not jason"
18684,lol . thats good to know in case i ever go to australia . birds really are amazing creatures . some even migrate from alask all the way to mexico without sleeping . thats amazing .
18685,"i wonder how many days the trip is . as amazing as nature is to create such magnificent creatures , birds can be jerks too . hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to build their nest . too bad spider ."
18686,dont hurt my feelings any . they can kill all the spiders they want to .
18687,"lol . in any case , thank you for the humorous chat ."
18688,no problem . have a good one .
18689,"hello there , are you a big movie fan ?"
18690,"yes , love movies . how about yourself ?"
18691,yeah i do as well . did you see the movie lady bird ?
18692,"i did . what did you think of it ? i never really get those oscar nominee's movies , i always have to look up the meaning afterwards lol there is always a hidden meaning , symbolism , or something ."
18693,"yeah there is always something like that . i thought it was pretty good , it kept my attention throughout anyways then i know it's decent ."
18694,"yeah , i think i was just waiting for something more to happen . do you like horror films ? watching horror movies can burn 180 calories !"
18695,"yeah i do enjoy a good horror movie . wow ! that is crazy , they should market that and people will watch more ."
18696,i know right ! maybe they can package it with a diet program or something ! lol
18697,yeah they should lol . do you know what the name of the instrument they use to make the majority of metallic noises in horror movies with ?
18698,"a waterphone . also , i learned that the noises on walking dead when the zombies are eating humans is actually a guy eating fried chicken !"
18699,"yeah good call ! that is awesome , i wonder how much they get paid , i would take that job ."
18700,"hell yeah , me too ! haha its funny that the boy from the shining didnt know he was in a scary movie lol"
18701,"i never heard that about that movie , it's such a classic ! i wonder what role he thought he was auditioning for ."
18702,hmmm sesame street ? lol i actually havent watched the movie either but i have seen clips .
18703,"yeah maybe lol ! how about meryl streep , are you a fan of hers ? or are you like jerry seinfeld ?"
18704,"i like meryl streep , shes is good actress . its funny that her first role was a sports movie lol"
18705,"i didn't know that , yeah i think she is pretty good as well . i know she has been nominated for a lot of academy awards ."
18706,"yeah , i didnt realize her daughter is an actress too , apparently she is on mr . robot ."
18707,"i didn't know either , i wonder if she will stay acting as long as clint eastwood ."
18708,"maybe if there are roles available to her , she is very talented ."
18709,"yeah i think there will be plenty of roles still for her . well it was nice talking with you , i hope you have a good night ."
18710,did you know that stephen king was terrified of the movie bambi as a child ?
18711,"no , i didn't know , why ?"
18712,"i guess he says it traumatized him and he felt it was the first horror movie he ever saw , that movie will scar you haha"
18713,"no , it didn't scare me , i was sad . i was scared reading edgar allan poe , and you ?"
18714,"i like the raven , i think the poetry was amazing , i never liked his stories i didn't think they were scary , what about you ?"
18715,"i was scared to death , lol , do you know that mary shelley wrote frankenstein ? are you afraid of him ?"
18716,"i did know that , i saw the movie with robert deniro , that movie kind of stinks but apparently you can burn up to 180 calories watching a horror movie , so hopefully i burned some calories watching that haha"
18717,"hahahahahaha i need to burn a lot of calories , i will start being a fan of horror movies , lol , i just saw the bird box , was terrified . do you like meryl streep ?"
18718,"i heard bird box was good but never saw it , i don't know i can't say that i like her , i do know her first movie was in a sports movie , do you like her ?"
18719,"yes , i do , i have seen her in almost every movie . do you like birds ?"
18720,"ya birds are fine , i like eating them the best especially chicken and turkey ! what about you ? we're having chicken tonight actually"
18721,"hahahahaha , no , i don't like to much chicken and turkey , i prefer pork , completely , i didn't know anything about the elephant birds , i am going to google them now . have you read about it ?"
18722,"haven't heard about them , i do know about the dodo bird though , it was a relative of the pigeon and was hunted to extinction because sailors were eating them , they were probably delicious haha"
18723,"hahaha , well , i have read all about the expeditions to the north and south poles , they ate even their back packs . hunger is hunger , i didn't know that they fly non stop that they even don't sleep ."
18724,"that is wild , i love that hummingbirds steal spider webs to use in their nests , like that is so smart and ' eco friendly ' haha"
18725,"hahaha , sure , the spider hate them , hahahah , they need to have their own police . i would love to have a bird high metabolic rate , though"
18726,"haha i want to meet these spider police that arrest hummingbirds for web theft , like those would have to be some super big and super beefy spiders !"
18727,"hahaha , you are funny . well , now we can see that there are birds adapted to air , to the ground and water birds ."
18728,"what about the birds in austrailia that can mimic the sound of chainsaws and cameras , like that would be freaky to think theres a guy chasing you with a chainsaw but its really a bird haha"
18729,"hahahahaha , well , that would be really a horror movie ! i would be so scared , besides , i would be an easy prey . i can't run . lol ."
18730,"haha that would make a funny horror movie , the animals in austrailia are horrifying enough as it is !"
18731,who do you think will take it big at the academy awards ?
18732,i have no idea . i haven't watched any movies this year . how about you ? did meryl streep do anything ? she has won more golden globes than anyone .
18733,washington post film critics made some forecasts .
18734,what was your favorite movie this year ? king kong was one of mine in the past . meryl streep auditioned for the lead role in the 1976 one .
18735,"i can't say any stand out right now , but i would like to see the mr . rogers documentary"
18736,"oh , i loved his show . he was a great person who spoke at congress to make sure they didn't drop funding for pbs . i wonder what he would think of the world today . do you watch horror ? i heard they use a waterphone for much of the creepy music ."
18737,i am afraid of horror . danny from the shining didn't even know he was in a horror film until several years afterwards
18738,"hmm , i guess he didn't read the script . since he was so young i guess his parents got all of his pay . i heard meryl streep's first film role was a sports movie . do you like sports ?"
18739,i love sports ! streep was called ugly in italian in her first audition for king kong to which she understood the italian and replied back to the producer
18740,i friend of mine and i were on vacation in germany and were on a hiking trip with a german group back in the 70s . we were making jokes about them in english since they were all german . later one of the germans said ' are you from america ' in perfect english . how embarrassing .
18741,you can't ever be too careful . did you know that meryl streep has a daughter who is an actress playing an fbi agent on mr . robotgrace gummer ?
18742,i was wondering about that . i love that show . i have seen every season . i thought she looked like streep . do you like hummingbirds ; we have a feeder at my house . i heard they make their nest partially from spider webs .
18743,"wow , i've seen some . they are amazing how fast they flap . most birds bones are so hollow that their entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers ."
18744,i love to watch vultures high in the sky as they fly in circles for hours without flapping their wings . i bought an rc sailplane so i can fly like that . crows do it too in a limited way . have you seen any vultures up high ?
18745,"sometimes . that is amazing to watch ! speaking of watching , you can burn 180 calories watching a horror film ."
18746,"hmm , that is a good way to lose weight if you don't eat popcorn at the same time . did you read the book the shining ? i can't believe stephen king thought bambi was a horror movie ."
18747,"i saw the movie the shining i believe . disney movies have been creepy at times . i could see how bambi losing his mother in a fire could be horrific ! they say that if you watch a horror movie before viewing abstract art , you'll enjoy the art more . i guess it heightens your senses ."
18748,i hate abstract art . i like impressionism and realism . i can't believe they get millions of dollars for stuff that looks like it took them 5 minutes and just threw paint around . did you know horror has been a film genre for over one hundred years ?
18749,wow ! edgar allan poe and mary shelley have some timeless classics in horror .
18750,i heard poe had a fear of being buried alive . they didn't know back then that people could be unconscious to the point they have weak vital signs . so some were buried in coffins and woke up trapped until they ran out of air and really died . i wonder if meryl streep who has been nominated for 21 academy awards has been in a horror film .
18751,"that is creepy but a bit paranoid . but perhaps if the dodo bird thought of that , maybe it could have survived extinction ."
18752,"hi there , how are you ? have you ever read washington irving's ' sleepy hollow ' ?"
18753,i read it in school actually . it is a good story . the headless horseman was freaky
18754,synetic theater has turned it into a play . it would be interesting to see it in theater format .
18755,"i saw the movie many years ago , and i agree , i would be great as a play . i wonder how they do the headless horseman in the play ."
18756,"i'm sure they do it through costume design . i think this version of the play is a little different than the traditional story , adding war and a romantic rivalry ."
18757,"well i like when people do different interpretations . it will still have the basics im sure , such as icobod crane . i remember him being kind of a wuss in the original ."
18758,haha i think he was kind of a wuss as well . in this interpretation he's kind of a thug and hangs out with a bunch of army guys . i guess they toughened him up a bit .
18759,they also made a play about edgar allen poe called nevermore . it was a musical
18760,hmm interesting . it's good to know that texas has theater . i had no idea . prices aren't bad either .
18761,texas theatre might be a little less stuck up than other theatre communities . they probably serve beer and bbq during the show
18762,that would be amazing ! do you think the use a real horse on stage ?
18763,ha . i doubt it . i think they would use actors or puppeteers .
18764,"you never know , horses have been used in a ton of movies ."
18765,"true , but i can imagine they would be harder to control on stage in front of an audience . i see a big risk for an accident"
18766,"true , we have been domesticating them for thousand of years though . some even use to work with firefighters ."
18767,horses are amazing creatures . people have been using them since 4000 bc
18768,"yeah , i don't know i feel about people racing them for sport . are you a fan ?"
18769,"never cared much about horse racing . . i think horses are great creatures , but i would rather watch other forms of racing"
18770,"me too , i think it's a rough life for them . did you see the new movie bohemian rhapsody ?"
18771,"i have not , but i am a big fan of queen . how was it ?"
18772,it was pretty awesome . i was listening to their greatest hits album recently . freddie mercury has a great voice .
18773,he was an amazing performer who died too young
18774,"hi , how are you tonight ? do you go to concerts much ?"
18775,i do go to concerts sometimes . the last concert i went to was lollapalooza . what about you . do you ever go to concerts ? i've always wanted to go to linkin park concert personally
18776,"i used to go when i was younger , but now , not so much . no time , little money . how was linkin park ?"
18777,"well i always wanted to go to a linkin park concert . i never actually went so far , i just know that they tour a lot , for instance in 2001 they did 324 shows"
18778,how did they that ? ! 324 is an astounding number . they must not have slept . or they were young and full of energy . too bad about their lead singer .
18779,"yep i agree , it's too bad that he's gone now . it's crazy to that the ramones played 2200 concerts in about 20 years , i would definitely check them out as well"
18780,how rich are they ? they must be rolling in dough . the fans must love them to support 20 years of touring . i guess new fans have appeared every generation .
18781,"oh they're definitely loaded lol . i really would like to see a concert in the ancient roman amphitheatre , it's still being used today and it's in croatia"
18782,i think that's great ! i wonder how comfortable the seats are though . the acoustics must be interesting as well . i wonder if the ramones ever played there .
18783,i wonder that too ! would you ever see creed in concert ? i read that they were sued because people were displeased with their concert
18784,"i wonder if the fans won their lawsuit , or if the band settled . the case may have had merit , in which case i wouldn't be surprised if the band decided to stop recording and touring ."
18785,"i know right lol they should take that as a hint haha . do you like pink floyd at all ? they apparently played at an amphitheatre , and i would have loved to have seen that"
18786,floyd is great . i would have loved to watch them play . but why an empty stadium ? were the acoustics better ?
18787,i know right lol i hope they recorded it on tv for everyone to see though . but maybe not cuz they were kind of weird haha . have you ever seen the movie frozen by the way ?
18788,"haven't seen frozen . heard of it . supposed to be good , with lots of good songs . have you seen it ?"
18789,i have seen it . it's ok . it's not the best movie that disney ever made in my opinion . i do know that the director was the first director of a disney animated movie though
18790,"women don't get many opportunities to direct , i know . i think the movie probably needed a woman's touch . it's about a princess , right ?"
18791,"it is about a princess . i can't believe you haven't heard the song let it go , that was like a huge song on that movie first came out , and apparently they changed the main character to go with that song so that she was good instead of being evil , because she was going to be evil initially"
18792,i guess i'm old and out of touch ! lol . i think that it must have been a powerful song for them to change the character around that way .
18793,i need to see the movie . just to let you catch up with the times maybe haha . do you listen to adele by the way ?
18794,i don't know adele . is she a singer ?
18795,"yep she's a singer . she did the theme for the movie skyfall , you remember the one with james bond and everything . apparently daniel craig started crying when he first heard that theme"
18796,"hi , how are you doing today ? do you go to concerts much ?"
18797,"hello there , i am well thank you . i do like to go , but i haven't been going as much as i would like to , how about you ?"
18798,i used to go . not so much now . not much time or money . do you know the band linkin park ?
18799,"yeah the time is the real issue now days . and yeah i have heard of them , how about you ?"
18800,i don't really know their music . i'm impressed that linkin park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone . that's some stamina .
18801,that is a crazy schedule for one year of touring ! wow !
18802,they must have made a mint . the fans must have been happy too .
18803,yeah i guess if you were a fan chances are they would be playing a show somewhere near you that year .
18804,the ramones have played a ton of concerts as well . i expect their fans would be happy too .
18805,yeah those guys are pretty good as well . did you know that lou reed and his wife once held a high frequency concert for dogs ?
18806,i guess the dogs appreciated that ? i dunno . why ? was it for publicity ? in 2002 a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band . i hope the dogs didn't sue lou reed .
18807,"yeah that sounds pretty sad , it sounds like they didn't like the show , so don't buy another ticket , simple ."
18808,"i guess , but maybe they felt cheated and wanted to teach the band a lesson . i've been to bad concerts , but a lawsuit is a lot of headache and time ."
18809,"yeah same here , and to me there are too many people suing too many other people these days ."
18810,"in croatia , there is an ancient roman amphitheatre that is still in use as a concert venue . i wonder what bigname acts play there now ."
18811,i think that is so cool . i guess they do say thing were built to last back then .
18812,that's true . . would you play a concert to an empty stadium like pink floyd ?
18813,"i think i wouldn't mind doing that yeah , it would be a nice change of pace ."
18814,i guess the acoustics must have been exquisite . or the band was high on drugs .
18815,"that and probably both , i am a big pink floyd fan , but mostly of their first album ."
18816,i know a few of their songs . i've heard they did great concerts . i would love to have gone to one .
18817,"yeah same here , i would of loved to have seen syd barrett perform with the band live . it was nice chatting with you today , i hope you have a good one !"
18818,hey did you know that pink floyd recorded a concert once to no audience ?
18819,"pink floyd tried to push the boundaries , man . they would record whereever they had to , man , to get the sound , man , that they had to for their audience , man . floyd was the man , man"
18820,"haha floyd is awesome , and ya that concert was in an ancient roman amphitheater , only they would do that haha"
18821,what about the amphitheater in croatia ? they forgot about that ! it is still in use !
18822,oh ya they should have played that one to with no audience ! do you like the ramones ?
18823,"i have heard their music , i have listened to their music , and yet i do not know their music . do you know their music ?"
18824,"i have heard their music , i'm not crazy about them , but i do respect their touring , over 2000 shows in 20 years is a lot"
18825,they must have used some special drugs designed by the government ! i think that they measure up to linkin park !
18826,"oh totally , that linkin park played 324 concert in a year aka almost one per day is pure insanity !"
18827,the kids know how to keep up the momentum ! i wish i had their energy !
18828,"i know right ! what i would be embarrased with is being sued for having bad concerts , like creed was , thats embarrassing haha"
18829,that creed concert sounded really unenjoyable ! i would have sued too !
18830,"haha i agree , i don't like creed so maybe i'm biased but that is bad ! do you like the singer adele ?"
18831,i do not know who that is . i am sorry about that was she sued by her fans ?
18832,"haha no she's a famous singer , she did the theme for the movie skyfall , apparently daniel craig started crying when he first heard that"
18833,daniel craig i head cries a lot . i'm not surprised !
18834,lol he definitely doesn't compare to sean connery when it comes to james bond
18835,he tries his best . we cannot all be sean . every bond has his charms . there will be a female bond one day .
18836,"haha ya i think so , back to adele she said the spice girls were a major influence on her , which i do like the spice girls haha"
18837,"don't know the spice girls , but i do know spice . anyways , thanks for the chat ! stay safe ! stay foolish ! stay groovy"
18838,haha you stay groovy too ! ya check out the spice girls they have some catchy songs !
18839,do you like to listen to the piano ?
18840,"i do . i used to play . pretty funny that on april 18th , 1930 the bbc felt there was no news worth reporting do they broadcast piano music instead ,"
18841,"simpler times my friend simpler times . i can not play the piano , except for some of chopstick , lol !"
18842,haha . freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney did to record hey jude .
18843,that sounds cool . there was an aluminum piano built for the lounge of the hindenburg that weighed 356 lbs .
18844,i would love to see that ! in 2006 a group of climbers found a piano when they reached the top of britain's highest mountain .
18845,sounds strange but ok . do you know who bartolomeo cristofori was ?
18846,no i don't think so . who ?
18847,"he invented the acoustic , stringed musical instrument back in the 1700 which the strings were struck by hammers ."
18848,oh . okay . do you like to read ?
18849,"yeah but mostly audible books now , you ? i hear the fda burned tons of literature as an act of censorship ."
18850,"i'm sure they did ! did you know architecture , literature , music , painting and sculpture were olympic events from 1912 to 1952 ."
18851,"wow , again simpler times my friend . wow i did not know that romantic kissing is a fairly recent development ."
18852,"oh , it is ? there is a song composed solely for stress testing autopianos ."
18853,wonder what that sounds like . have you ever ridden a horse ? i did when i was a kid but not since becoming an adult .
18854,i wonder too . i have not ridden a horse in a very long time .
18855,clint eastwood developed a midlife allergy to horses . i wonder if he was just tired of doing westerns .
18856,haha i wonder ! d ? id you know dalmations are part of the fire department because they used to be used to keep the horses calm and to also protect them ?
18857,wow i did not but that makes since because dogs have been a great contributor to man . apparently the horse is one of two extant subspecies of equus ferus .
18858,"oh , i did not know that . sounds pretty amazing . i know horses were domesticated in a widespread manner by 3000 bc , so they have been around people for a long time ."
18859,"funny note , two high school kids road horses to school on no vehicle day , hilarious !"
18860,that is funny ! it was good chatting . bye .
18861,"hello , how are you doing tonight ?"
18862,"hello , doing good ! ! do you like to read ?"
18863,"i do , how about yourself ?"
18864,i have always liked to read ! ! and sometimes write fiction . did you know there is a contest to create the worst opening sentence to a novel ?
18865,"i didn't , however i believe i could contend with that one ! did you ever read sleepy hollow ?"
18866,no i have not but seems kind of creepy . . . kind of dark . . i did imagine the dark forest with a ghosthly horse and horseman . . . did you read it ?
18867,"i did read it , i love horror novels . the way they described everything with such detail was amazing . the crimes that ichabod crane did in the story , theres no wonder why he came back ."
18868,i think i would like the musical performance in theaters . . the composer actually appears on stage . . creepy too !
18869,yea that would be amazing to get to see . have you ever tried to play the piano ?
18870,"yes a little bit , i have one but i am a bass player . did you know about the piano that freddie mercury used to play bohemian rhapsody ?"
18871,"no , what about it ?"
18872,that is the same piano that was used by paul mc cartney to play hey jude ! !
18873,"that's awesome , i did not know that ! did you know in 1930 the bbc said there was no news so they just played piano music !"
18874,oh really ? that would not happen today . they would not allow even 30 seconds without revenue ! did you know a bizarre place and situation where a piano was found ?
18875,"i am not sure , do tell !"
18876,it was back in 2006 a group of climbers found it on top of the highest britain's mountain ! !
18877,that's crazy ! did you know they built a piano for the airship hindenburg ? it weighed 356 pounds and was made from aluminum .
18878,wow ! ! i did not know that . . how light . i wonder how it sounded ?
18879,i am not sure ! well its been nice talking with you !
18880,"well , thanks for the chat ! ! you have a good one !"
18881,bye !
18882,what forms of entertainment do you enjoy ?
18883,"oh , i really love listening to adele when i am on a long car ride . she won a grammy in 2009 ."
18884,"indeed she is an impressive singer and songwriter . she has 10 platinums so far in both the us and uk , a impressive achievement"
18885,exactly ! she also won the best new artist and best female pop vocal performance in 2009 . i relate to her because she is shy and has a hard time looking into the camera when she performs .
18886,she has a wonderful singing voice . her skyfall theme even brought daniel craig to tears
18887,"yes , i had heard that too . some of her early influencers were the spice girls . that is pretty funny since they do not have the same sound at all !"
18888,her album 21 is still the biggest selling uk album of the 21st century
18889,"yep , she is the best ! my young daughter and i watched the movie frozen for the first time today . it was so cute ! it is actually the 53rd disney feature film ."
18890,do you enjoy animated disney films ?
18891,"yes , we usually do . this one was extra cute . it grossed over 1 billion in box office revenue . did you see it ?"
18892,i did enjoy how disney made the movie more kid friendly while maintaining a good story . also frozen is the first disney animated film with a female director
18893,"yes , i also had heard that the name was changed from snow queen to frozen based on previous feminine film titles underperforming at the box office ."
18894,i wonder if that is a coincidence . we almost never had elsa as we know it if let it go wasn't so uplifting . that song alone changed her from the main villain to protagonist
18895,"yes , that is weird ! disney also changed the movie rapunzel to the name tangled for the same reason , low sales ."
18896,"i personally enjoy music , which is why i though let it go was a wonderful song . do you enjoy music and concerts as well ?"
18897,"yes , i love music too ! live music is usually the best plan for a date night for my husband and i . what about you ?"
18898,i want to go one day to go listen to a concert using a ancient roman amphitheater as a venue .
18899,that would be cool . i had learned that pink floyd recorded a live concert in pompeii once .
18900,"too bad they had no audience . i also enjoy linkin park and ramones . they have both played hundreds if not thousands of concerts , attesting to their skill"
18901,"yes , i would like to see linkin park live one day . it's too late to see the ramones though ."
18902,at least it wasn't a creed concert . i heard 4 were so bad that lawsuits were filed . i wonder if it was the problem of the band or venue
18903,yikes ! time to find a good concert to see this weekend ! see ya .
18904,thank you for the lovely chat .
18905,"hello , let's talk about venom"
18906,hello . sure . i believe tom hardy plays venom for the movie .
18907,"yes and ' venom , ' which represents sony's effort to build its own superhero universe , which is nice"
18908,chicago tribune wrote that it is a mess but a really funny and fascinating mess . . .
18909,"yes , did you know that in ' venom , ' which opens friday , hardy plays both eddie brock , a bay area digital journalist ?"
18910,"yes , i heard about it . do you like superheros in general ?"
18911,"yes alot , do you know ruben fleischer ?"
18912,not really . can you tell me more about him ?
18913,"i learned that the result , as directed by washington native ruben fleischer , ' zombieland ' , , can play like a oneman buddy picture that summons comparisons to ' liar , liar ' and ' all of me ' , interesting , right ?"
18914,"right . but the hollywood reporter , too , describes ' venom ' as a throwback of a superhero movie . i am curious about the movie now : ,"
18915,"me too , have you heard about the chicago tribune ?"
18916,"no , what did they say ?"
18917,"a real mess of a movie is ' so much more thrilling than any of the formulaic superhero movies that parade through multiplexes all year . , that's what been said . do you agree ?"
18918,"i agree . the new york post has the harshest review in which calls this assemblyline product ' a disaster on every level , from the hatchet job writing to the horrid performances ' that puts ' its focus on juvenile humor instead of heart or action . ' . that is too harsh i believe ."
18919,yes i agree with you . did you watch spiderman 3 ?
18920,"no , i did not . was it good ?"
18921,no it is not good in my opinion . ' spiderman 3 ' is aggressively loud and stupid without being much fun at all .
18922,"ah , good to know , thanks . i will not waste my time on it then . which superhero is your favorite ?"
18923,which is your favorite superhero ?
18924,ironman i think . . .
18925,"i like superman , do you heard about marvel comics ?"
18926,have you seen the movie ' venom ' ? tom hardy played a dual role but only scored a 28 percent fresh rating on rotten tomatoes .
18927,"i did , i thought it was a great movie , i think the ratings arent fair , did you watch it ?"
18928,i haven't seen it but the chicago tribune seemed to like it although they thought it was a mess of a movie .
18929,"you should watch it , its actually a good movie , it is fun and the leading actor is great he plays the role of venom and of eddie in style"
18930,i may . i seldom listen to critics . it is surprising that the hollywood reported said it was ' thoroughly irredeemable . '
18931,"it seems like a harsh review , i know marvel movies are in another leage but still calling it the poor cousin seems way out of line ."
18932,not all the reviews were bad . uproxx said that they thought venom has potential for cultmovie status .
18933,"yeah i guess their review was more accurate , its not a great movie but it is a fun movie to watch ,"
18934,would you go to a movie for a superhero ' normalman ' a guy with no superpowers surrounded by those that do ?
18935,"i dont think i would pay for that lol , seems a bit absurd , although he must be a badass to be a hero without powers kind of like batman ."
18936,"i watched a video of batman that was made during wwii , 1943 , . i guess that's the batman that stan lee reimaged when he worked on dc stuff ."
18937,"i havent watched that one i might look it in youtube later , stan lee did write 15 dc comics reimagining superheroes ."
18938,there is one character the dc and marvel both own . i wonder what one it is ? they like to keep things separate .
18939,"access is the name of the hero , and yeah i agree , both universes belong in different spaces ."
18940,"speaking of universes , there are people that think the universe is one big superhologram ."
18941,"that seems like a crazy theory to me , but who knows , theres a lot we dont know about the universe and its wonders ."
18942,here's another : there is theory that the universe contains only one electron . that's one hell of an electron !
18943,"it is , also sounds like a crazy theory just like how universes evolve though natural selection"
18944,there are also a crazy amount of superheros in the u . s . the number is 300 . how many can you name ? i couldn't even get close .
18945,"300 of them ? i bet i could name at least 20 ! garfield was a superhero once ,"
18946,"a cat , why not ? thanks for the chat , you were great ."
18947,did you watch venom ?
18948,"i didn't , but i have some friends who went and saw it . i've heard many people enjoyed it"
18949,"i thouhg it was a nice movie , the starring actor was nominated to a academy award , he acted well in the movie ."
18950,"venom is one of the most complex characters in the marvel universe , so it's not surprising that people felt like the movie was an enjoyable mess"
18951,"well it was a challenge to mix all elements in a proper way but sony didnt dissapoint and managed to do so , the movie recieved bat ratings though ,"
18952,"maybe the problem isn't the movie itself , but that the movie was released at a time when other marvel characters are getting more attention due to their connection to a bigger storyline"
18953,"yeah that makes sense but still it got a rating of 28 in rotten tomatoes and a score of 35 out of 100 in metacritic , i have to say i disagree with those rating of the movie"
18954,"it might be due to his origin story though . plus , he's not really a hero nor is he a villain , so many don't know what to do with the character . there are many other superhero movies set to release in the next two years"
18955,"yeah im exited to watch the movies marvel will release this year , captain marvel being one of them do you like marvel studios ?"
18956,i do enjoy marvel movies . i think disney acquiring marvel entertainment has been for the better . did you know they created a superhero just to encourage a young boy to wear his hearing aids ?
18957,"i didnt know that , i do think its a great deed , there is also a superhero called normalman lol"
18958,"of course there is . back in the 90s , michael jackson tried to buy the comics because he wanted to portray spiderman in his own movie"
18959,that would have been a scary movie for sure lol can you imagine michael jackson as spiderman ? thank god he wasnt able to buy the rights of the hero
18960,that would have been an interesting movie for sure . doctor strange's character originated as sir isaac newton in the marvel universe
18961,"i see , doctor strange is one of my favorite heroes , you know michael jackson wasnt the only one interested in the rights of spiderman apparently sony was too and bought the rights , marvel offered all the other characters for 25 million and sony thought they were worthless"
18962,little did they know . marvel has even trademarked the names ' superhero ' and ' supervillain '
18963,i wonder if dc comics has to pay them everytime they use those names in any of their movies or stories
18964,it may depend on the context of its use . many of the superheroes that are popular today are a result of an experiment stan lee did when he was planning on changing careers . i'm glad he didn't
18965,"im glad he didnt as well , he surely made a big contribution to general culture , its too sad he died ."
18966,i know . he's definitely changed the way we view superheroes . marvel wouldn't be where it is now without him . even the garfield book series created a pet force with garfield as a superhero
18967,"garfield is a badass so i can definetely see him as a superhero , stan lee also re wrote 15 dc comics in his own way"
18968,i'm sure they enjoyed that . he's definitely been a key player in the genre we know as superhero fiction
18969,"i think marvel and dc have a good relationship , there is a character owned by both franchises ."
18970,"maybe now , but the character of captain marvel has a long history of different variations . she and shazam both come from the same idea"
18971,do you enjoy superhero movies and marvel comics ?
18972,sometimes . for a while i was a bit bored with them
18973,what do you like about superheros ?
18974,just interesting to think about what kind of super power you would like and how you would use it . how about you ? what kind of super power would you like ? have you seen any superhero movies you really liked recently ?
18975,i would like to manipulate time but that is too much of a cheat . i did how they dealt with such a op power in heroes the tv show . did you know there is a comic series about fixing the collateral damage cased by superheros ?
18976,"ha , never heard of that one . that would be an interesting series . is it any good ?"
18977,"i personally liked it . i also liked the superhero called normalman , where they did a reverse and he was the only normal person in a planet full of superheroes"
18978,gives an interesting definition of the word 'normal' . did you ever see the movie venom ?
18979,"unfortunately , i have not , but i have read up a bit on it since it seemed interesting and had mixed reviews . i liked how tom hardy was casted as the lethal protector venom ."
18980,"i never saw it either , but while i heard the reviews were really bad , it was supposed to be kind of fun if you didn't take it seriously . did you know that if you could fold a piece of paper in half 103 times it would be as thick as the observable universe ?"
18981,"i know that on rotten tomatoes , it only got 28 percent , i think it was because it was so hyped . as a stand alone movie i heard it wasn't too bad despite the critics ."
18982,"yeah , i usually don't pay too much attention to what critics write . i'm generally pretty easily entertained when it comes to movies . how about you ?"
18983,"i tend to read them because its always nice to see things from different perspectives . for instance , a chicago tribune state that a the real mess of a movie was much more thrilling that the formulaic superhero movies all year prior ."
18984,there are definitely a lot of bad reviews out there for venom . one of the harshest reviews called it ' a disaster on every level '
18985,well bad movies aren't too bad . i mean there are movies like the elevator that are so bad that people watch it to laugh at how bad it really is .
18986,"ha , that's true , cause ishtar is also a fantastic movie . did you know there was once a garfield series spinoff where garfield and his gang were portrayed as superheros !"
18987,wow that sounds very interesting . it is too bad that some people felt that venom existed as a waste of time
18988,"i think it's impossible to please everyone . hopefully the people that made the movie liked it . while some people are down on the spiderman series , i actually liked some of the more recent movies ."
18989,"i personally really enjoyed the most recent spiderman spiderverse . while it has many elements like superhuman powers , fighting against evil , and battling supervillians , the artwork and story was really good ."
18990,"i haven't seen that one yet , but it's now on my list of movies to see ! any other recommendations ?"
18991,i would recommend what we do in the shadows or history of the world part 1 . both are comedies that i enjoyed . thank you for the wonderful chat .
18992,do you like to swim ?
18993,i do like to swim . in fact i have a pool .
18994,nice ! i'm jealous ! there is a competitive swimming type where the swimmer has their hands and legs bound and they swim like a dolphin . kind of odd .
18995,"oh okay , i would not be good at that at all ! but , the us has almost as many gold medals in swimming as the rest of the world combined , so i guess somewhere they're out there ."
18996,nice ! all cornell students have to pass a basic swimming test before they're allowed to graduate .
18997,now that would be hard ! there's no way i would be able to pass that test !
18998,lol have you ever heard of the front crawl swimming stroke ?
18999,i have heard of that . isn't it the one that native americans introduced to the west when they beat the british who only used the breaststroke ?
19000,you are correct ! good job ! there is a banned swimsuit so good that 94 percent of all swimming racers at the 2008 olympics wore it .
19001,"oh , wow ! that must have been some kind of special suit !"
19002,i guess so ! do you like soccer ?
19003,i do like soccer but not as much as football .
19004,well . . . they do call it football in other parts of the world . . . lol american's call it soccer as slang for association football . how about golf ?
19005,i like golf a little . did you know gold courses in america make up more space than rhode island and delaware combined ?
19006,"that's pretty incredible to think about . the average american golf course uses around 312 , 000 gallons of water per day !"
19007,"oh , that's nothing compared to a golf course in dubai that uses 4 million gallons a day ! so wasteful if you ask me !"
19008,whoa ! you're so right on that . i like how samuel jackson puts a golf clause in his film contracts . have you seen that ?
19009,no way ! do you know what the contract says ?
19010,it allows him to play golf twice a week during filming productions !
19011,"oh , what a smart man . did you know that babe ruth was once america's most famous golfer ?"
19012,i had no idea ! i bet he could drive the ball a mile !
19013,"yeah , i bet ! nice chatting today ! take care ."
19014,i had a good time ! have a good one !
19015,do you enjoy sports ?
19016,"yes , i do , but i don't know too much about them , i am reading about the big east scholar athlete sport excellence award"
19017,wasn't that award selecting from 311 athletes across 22 sports ?
19018,"yes , you got it . it recognizes academic and athletic achievement as well as comunity service . and i am reading about the hoyas , do you know something about it ?"
19019,i only recently read a bit that four recent graduates of georgetown were named winners of the award . do you have anything else to add ?
19020,"yes , do you like rowing ?"
19021,"i am aware of the sport , but i don't know much else . could you tell me about it ?"
19022,"well , juinor caroline o'brien won the lightweight pairs title in poznan , polanda . i guess is a very difficult sport ."
19023,"i heard that rowing is among the toughest sports physically . personally though , i am more interested in golf and swimming"
19024,do you play golf ? i didn't know that it was originated in scotland .
19025,i dabbled . did you know that the land dedicated to golf courses is larger than rhode island and delaware combined ?
19026,"yes , is amazing ! what i was wondering is how they consume so much water on the golf courses . do you think that is for water the land ?"
19027,i recently read they spend about 300k gallons per day . i bet we could fine better uses of water
19028,"yes , i would like to be able to watch the variation of soccer where 3 teams face each other at the same time , it would be fun , but i guess is more difficult for the referee ."
19029,"i would love to watch such a crazy match as well . it is crazy how soccer makes more money than football , basketball , and golf combined ."
19030,do you like to swim ? could you swim with your limbs bound as a dolphin ? i couldn't i am sure .
19031,"i could swim like that for a second , and then drown like a glass bottle ."
19032,"hahahahahaahah , is amazing what the german soccer player did , to pay for surgeries for 23 children in brazil"
19033,that was very generous of him . i'm glad some are doing charity with their large winnings
19034,"yes , i hope for rich people would do that , help the people with less money . did you now that babies can swim ? nice to meet you , giving you an excellent ."
19035,thank you to you as well .
19036,it seems like georgetown has a lot of talented athletes !
19037,that's true maybe it's something in the water ? do you watch swimming on tv ?
19038,"yeah that could be one of the reasons and i only watch swimming events when its a mayor competition like the olympics , what about you ?"
19039,"well i can't say i watch the olympics haha , i do know that there is a form of swimming where you tie your arms and legs and swim like a dolphin , that sounds wild haha"
19040,"that sounds wild and fun indeed lol , well we are the reigning champins in swimming gold medals , we have almost as many gold medals as the rest of the world together"
19041,"ya that is impressive , there is a swimsuit that it is so good it was banned from the olympics , i wonder what makes it so good"
19042,"i heard that 94 percent of the races were won by using that swimming suit , that is not a coincidence ."
19043,"right , like does it have fish scales or something haha ? do you know that soccer makes more money that all other sports combined worldwide ?"
19044,"i didnt know that but i guess it makes sense as its played in over 200 countries and a worldcup moves a of money by itself , do you like soccer ?"
19045,"no i can't ssay i do haha i don't watch sports unless i'm with friends , but it is weird that soccer is called football by the rest of the world , that makes more sense honestly because it's a game where only your foot touches the ball haha"
19046,"i agree football is a great name for the sport , soccer doesnt make much sense , there is a variation of soccer where 3 teams face ech other at the exact time"
19047,"wow i would check that out , and ya i guess people in the usa call it ' soccer ' because that is slang for association football , so that kind of makes sense"
19048,"it does make sense when you put it that way , did you watch the world cup back in 2014 ?"
19049,"haha can't say that i did ! i do know that the usa team isn't very good , what happened in that game ?"
19050,"well germany won the final and they all received like a 300 , 000 bonus , one of the players donated his bonus so that 23 children in brazil could affor surgeries ."
19051,"wow that is nice of him , did you ever watch the daily show ? i guess jon stewart was very skilled at football and played for the usa team back in 1983"
19052,"yeah i have watched the daily show although i had no idea he played football , he must have been really good"
19053,"ya it seems like it , do you play golf ? i never knew babe ruth was also a gofler"
19054,"i dont play it but like the sport , samuel l jackson also likes golf , he has a clause in his contracts that allows him to play golf while the movie is still in production"
19055,"haha that is funny , i always wondered about the golf course in dubai , like it's a dessert and it uses 4 millino gallons of water a day for teh grass !"
19056,"wow that is a lot of water , in america they usually consume 10 times less that cuantity ."
19057,"that is impressive , also impressive is that usa golf courses take up more space than delaware and rhode island put together"
19058,soccer is the most famous ball game in the world
19059,"yes lets talk about soccer , also called association football . soccer is the most popular sport in the world ."
19060,the brazilian ronaldo is still my favorite player
19061,"the sport earns a lot of money also , more than football , basketball , and baseball combined to name a few ."
19062,it is played by almost every country in the world
19063,the world soccer which americans use is slang for association football
19064,"i agree , when i say football normally i refer to soccer"
19065,there is a version of soccer where three teams go against each other instead of two .
19066,i can only imagine how difficult that will be . i still prefer the normal two team game . world cup is in 2022 btw
19067,"interesting , mesut ozil donated his world cup victory bonus to help 23 kids in brazil to receive surgeries"
19068,such a nobel act . ronaldo 7 also have done a share of contributions .
19069,"lets talk about kpop next , there is a kpop boy band that is managed by jackie chan"
19070,south korea blasted a hit kpop responding after one of their ships was sunk by south korea in 2010
19071,"yes , the song was called 'hit your heart' and they used large military speakers"
19072,the most popular kpop girl band in north korea is moranbong band
19073,"there have been popular kpops bands that where popular in the us also , back in the 1960s there where three young women who were popular"
19074,"back to soccer , qatar is preparing to hold the world cup for 2020"
19075,"and talking about the world cup , the city hosting in qatar does not exist yet and i think its 2022"
19076,you are correct i meant 2022 . it sure will be so hot for the players and humid
19077,the us won 3rd place in the first world cup back in 1930
19078,yah those days are gone when they played better
19079,when a country host there ends up being no net economic gains for them .
19080,do you know how old tom wolfe was when he passed away ?
19081,"yeah , he was 88 ."
19082,"i know he wrote a bunch , but how many really popular novels was he responsible for ?"
19083,i think he wrote 4 popular novels
19084,there's something called the first law of wolfe fiction . what was that ?
19085,that was wolfe's idea that in order to have a good novel you had to have good reporting .
19086,interesting . i guess the first book of his i read was ' bonfire of the vanities ' . do you know when that was published ?
19087,i believe it was published in 1987 .
19088,that was quite awhile before that atlantabased novel of his . i forget the title of it . do you know ?
19089,"oh , i remember that one ! it was a man in full ."
19090,that's it ! he lost the national book award that year though . do you know what work won it ?
19091,"yes , it was charming billy ."
19092,"i like wolfe's novel better . i also like his final book , ' back to blood ' . which city does it take place in ?"
19093,"i remember it being set in miami , florida ."
19094,i often wonder how wolfe would've dealt with a cyborg in one of his novels . even edgar allen poe wrote of one once .
19095,"i feel like his take on a cyborg would have been a bit off , because he wouldn't be able to go and research that as well ."
19096,perhaps so . maybe he could've used that wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities .
19097,i feel like if he was still around writing he would be a big user of wikis .
19098,probably so . i would like to see someone adapt one of wolfe's novels for comedy film .
19099,"yes , it would interesting to see back to blood adapted into a comedy film ."
19100,thanks for the chat ! i think i will go read some literature now !
19101,i enjoyed the chat ! i will as well .
19102,i'll leave you on this . remember that the fda once burned six tons of literature !
19103,do you know much about the us senate ?
19104,i know some stuff . did you know that fred rogers was the guy that continued the funding of pbs ?
19105,wow cool . they had a gavel for 165 years before nixon cracked it
19106,wow too bad . do you know why truman was elected vp under roosevelt ?
19107,"i have no idea , there was a particular reason for that ?"
19108,yes he was so good he figured there is a lot of corruption within senate and saved billions
19109,"wow that is so cool , he really deserved the spot then"
19110,yeah . do you know which senator has the record in fillibusters ?
19111,"i have no idea , someone did a long one ?"
19112,yes it lasted for over 24 hours and thurmond spoke non stop
19113,wow he must have been exhausted when that was over
19114,yeah i bet so too and i wonder what he talked about really
19115,me too . do you vote all the time ?
19116,yes i sure do . did you know a chimpanzee once ran and got almost half a million votes in rio de janiero ?
19117,wow amazing . the astronauts vote from space
19118,so cool . jfk voted against the civil rights act in '57
19119,wow that is sad . in the uk not all men were allowed to vote until 1918
19120,i wonder if that had anything to do with social status back then
19121,"maybe , you make a good point there . in alabama , one third of the black male population cannot vote"
19122,wow i wonder if that is related to the felony laws that are in place
19123,that could be it . nice chat here
19124,do you watch much tv ?
19125,"some , although i read a lot as well . a fan of tom wolfe ."
19126,isn't he dead ? i think he died at the age of 88 .
19127,"yes , he was known for his writing and his white suits !"
19128,white suits ! ? isn't he from the bronx ? wrong place to be wearing a white suit .
19129,perhaps so . the bonfire of the vanities is a great novel !
19130,"never read it . did watch the movie though . but that has been awhile . the book came out , i believe in 1987 , the movie some time later . didn't that have tom cruise in it ?"
19131,i think so . the movie isn't really representative of the book . makes me glad they didn't do one for ' a man in full ' .
19132,how so ? never read that book either . i like to watch movies and tv . one of my favorite shows was 3rd rock from the sun . remember that one ?
19133,"sure . it won a golden globe over shows like seinfeld , friends and frasier ."
19134,"i loved the tom , dick , and harry name play . comedy is one of the oldest genres of film ."
19135,"perhaps so , but bill murray thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme achievement in that field !"
19136,bill murray a comedic god . loved caddyshack ! ryan stiles actually dropped out of school to become a comedian .
19137,that's ironic . demetri martin chose to go into comedy instead of harvard law !
19138,that's a good thing ! last thing this world needs is another lawyer ! lol
19139,"then again , the law has a lot in common with bromantic comedies ."
19140,"yeah . . . the law and movies like the hangover , and harold and kumar have so much in common . smh !"
19141,fiction is often stranger than truth . it is all about powers and abilities .
19142,now that's what law is common with . . . fiction . neither are based strictly on history or fact ! lol
19143,"julius caesar was a fan of government , the law and fiction ."
19144,julius caesar was a fan of a failed government . the was no law and he used fiction as a way to get away from reality . george martin despises fiction and i can see why . not a big fan .
19145,"fair enough , as long as one doesn't go the fda route and burn tons of literature ! have a good one !"
19146,"hello , did you know that in the 1950's a judge apparently tried to ban a science fiction comic book because it had a black character as it's feature character ?"
19147,"no , i had no idea . did you know that george rr martin despises fan fiction , saying it is a bad exercise for aspiring writers . my son writes a lot of fan fiction ."
19148,"no i didn't know that , what is fan fiction ? i've never heard of it ."
19149,it's ficitional stories based on whatever you're a fan of . like my son is a fan of star wars so he writes stories based on the characters .
19150,"oh that's great ! i enjoyed all of the star wars movies also , what is your favorite kind of movie or book ?"
19151,"i enjoy fiction books , and some self help books . i love horror movies . did you know that edgar allen poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction ."
19152,"i did not know that , i love horror movies also . i see that wikipedia has a page that ranks all fictional characters according to their abilities or powers , that would be interesting to read !"
19153,i am going to have to look that one up . i am sure there is a wikipedia page for everything . i didn't know that julius caesar wrote fan fiction of hercules and oedipus in his youth . guess fan fiction has been around really long time .
19154,"that is very interesting about him writing that when he was so young , i didn't know that . i would actually like to try writing a little fan fiction as well , it would be hard to decide which series to write about though ."
19155,what are some of your favorites ? my son writes on a fan fiction site .
19156,"just about anything really , that is well written and has good acting , my favorite is horror . i din't know there was sites like that , i will have to look at them . i see that the show 3rd rock from the sun , a comedy back in the 90's actually won the golden globe award in 1997 , beating out seinfeld , friends and frazier . that's hard to believe ."
19157,"that is very hard to believe . i didn't like that show at all . and to beat out friends , seinfeld and frasier ? ! crazy ! never would have guessed ."
19158,"i didn't like the show as well , i loved seinfeld and frasier , never really watched friends until the reruns started playing . my favorite show on tv is criminal minds , what is your favorite tv show ?"
19159,"my favorite tv shows are survivor , walking dead , this is us ."
19160,"i really enjoy survivor , amazing race and big brother . i'm just starting to watch the walking dead on amazon prime , it's really good . i haven't watched this is us , but iv'e seen it advertised . i see that comedian demetri martin was actually accepted into harvard law , but left due to boredom ! now he's a comedian ."
19161,i don't know who that is . did you know that there is a genre of movies called bromantic comedies like the hangover and pineapple express ? that is funny .
19162,"i had never heard of him either . i'm glad to see the guys finally being openly ' bromantic ' . . . . . lol . it's a quality to be proud of . don't know why it was always made fun of , when men were sensitive or had ' feelings ' ."
19163,"that is so true . i wish my boyfriend was more sensitive and could express his feelings . ugh he says men are not suppose to be that way . whatever . ryan stiles dropped out of high school to pursue comedy , he's on who's line is it anyway ? right ?"
19164,"yes i think he is on that show . i see that in 1912 to 1952 architecture , literature , painting , music and sculpture were actual olympic events . . . . wow !"
19165,wow ! i always thought the oympics were just sports . the fda burned six tons of literature in an act of us censorship . that's horrible .
19166,"that is horrible ! horrible considering all of the trees that were cut down to make that paper for the literature , and then it was just burned ! our poor environment ."
19167,hi how are you ? do you like shoes ?
19168,i'm doing well thanks . i love shoes . they offer a form of protection and comfort but are also used as decoration fashion .
19169,"yes , i am quite partial to shoes . i wear them frequently , both for comfort and fashion . i think that they are a great invention ."
19170,yeah no doubt . i also think it's kind of funny how much shoes can vary in cost . from sandals to highend fashion shoes .
19171,"yeah , i heard that there are some old shoes that are much better than the ones made these days ."
19172,oh yeah . isn't it crazy to think that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes . must have had more durable material .
19173,i bet they were well made because they had to last . one pair for your whole life . lol
19174,yeah that is pretty cool . another good trick is putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes or gym bags because they absorb the unpleasant odor .
19175,does that work ? my shoes can get pretty stinky . maybe two or three bags ? lol
19176,ha ha yeah that might just work . there was an nfl wide receiver named steve smith who left his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness for homeless people without shoes .
19177,"that is a great gesture , to help people that we often forget about . i think more athletes should do that ."
19178,agreed . i wish more players did that . there is an nba player who promoted a line of shoes that retail that 15 he was not paid to endorse them . that is very rare .
19179,i wonder if those shoes were any good . why only 15 dollars ? seems low .
19180,it is hard to believe shoes costing that cheap . hopefully ballet shoes are cheap because the dancers go through 4 pairs per week !
19181,i would probably go through a dozen a week . i am a terrible dancer ! lol
19182,haha me too . i am a huge proponent of voting . not all men could vote at one time in the uk in 1918 .
19183,i wonder what the restriction was . men that had to fight and die for their country could not vote ? seems wrong .
19184,yeah it seems very wrong . even astronauts vote from space !
19185,"i guess they have to be allowed to vote . i wish that the govt made more of an effort for other votes . anyway , great chat !"
19186,"yes me too . people vote for eveything even renaming their garbage dump in austin , tx lol . nice chatting with you too . have a good one ."
19187,nice chatting with you too ! have a good day .
19188,bye !
19189,do you like fictiob ?
19190,i love it . there is a wiki pages where you can find the characters ranked based on their powers
19191,yeah that is super cool . do you know who edgar allen poe was ?
19192,yeah he wrote the oldest example of a cyborg in fiction
19193,yeah . caesar also wrote fiction of hercules
19194,yeah as well as oedipus when he was young
19195,yeah . did you know a judge once tried to ban science fiction ?
19196,yes oly because the novel had a black character
19197,yes that is so sad but i guess it was the 50s
19198,true . do you know why george rr martin does not like fiction ?
19199,yeah he said that t is is a copyright infringement
19200,yeah . do you like comedies ?
19201,i love them . have you heard of bromantic comedies ?
19202,"yes i have like the movie hangover , they are too hillarious"
19203,yes they are indeed . have you ever seen 3rd rock from the sun ?
19204,i have . did you know it won a golden globe for best comedy in 1997 ?
19205,"yes and it beat friends , steinfeld and frasier , amazing"
19206,i know right ? did you know demetri martin dropped out of harvard law to pursue a career in comedy ?
19207,"yeah but he did well , and so did ryan stiles"
19208,true . do you like literature ?
19209,i love it . did you know the fda once burned tons of books ?
19210,"hi , how are you ?"
19211,i am good . how are you ? do you like pandas ? i've heard that panda researchers wear panda costumes to work .
19212,"what ? ! that's a strange work uniform . i guess the pilgrims would approve . they wore colorful clothing , not just white and black ."
19213,that is so bizarre ! every time you see pilgrims in movies and tv they seem to always be dressed in black .
19214,"a sober , dour people in film , but rather colorful in real life . i guess people think they're like the amish . i didn't know that apple had a line of clothes in the 80s . what ? !"
19215,i didn't know that either . you'd think you'd see some apple clothing for sale on ebay or something .
19216,a collector's item . i bet it wouldn't be made in north korea .
19217,oh i know what you are talking about there . i've heard about that . they have a clothes line but the labels say made in china .
19218,that's pretty sneaky of them . i think there is some sort of embargo or sanctions on north korea . not supposed to do business with them .
19219,you're probably right about that . have you heard that 5000 year old shoes are way better than any made today ?
19220,nowadays everything is throwaway . couldn't throw away shoes back then and buy a new pair . had to last a lifetime !
19221,true enough . nowadays ballet dancers go through 4 pair of shoes in a week .
19222,i wonder how they would do with those 5000 year old shoes .
19223,i imagine just one a week ! i wonder if those old shoes smelled ? there's all kinds of products these days for shoe odor such as dry tea bags .
19224,but what kind of tea ? earl grey ? darjeeling ? ballet dancers can be quite picky about the tea varieties .
19225,after worrying over what kind of tea you have to worry over what kind of shoe . if you go high end they are made with expensive materials .
19226,it's a tricky balance between shoe cost and tea bag cost . i'm not savvy enough to reckon the calculation .
19227,haha ! you know what i think is nice ? i think it's nice that some football player leaves his shoes on the field after a game to make people aware of the homeless without shoes .
19228,i hope that people recognize the gesture . many of us are lucky in ways that we don't know .
19229,i hope people notice . his name is steve smith . i think he should have reporters mention it during post game .
19230,"well , i enjoyed chatting with ya !"
19231,nice chatting with you as well !
19232,are you into comedy films ?
19233,"yes , i do , i like all forms of comedy films ."
19234,"which is your favorite , do you like bill murray ?"
19235,he is one of my favorites ! he has made so many funny movies !
19236,"for sure , he said kung fu hustle was the best comedy film , have you seen that ?"
19237,"no , that's something i haven't seen . i bet its good ! the first movie i saw him in was caddyshack . lol"
19238,"that was such a great movie , i liked his cameo in zombieland lol ! did you ever watch 3rd rock from the song in the 90s ?"
19239,"very little , i knew it won a golden globe though !"
19240,"for sure , they beat out seinfeld of all shows in 1997 . i watched a little also , never understood it"
19241,"yeah , it had a hard time keeping my attention . but , i loved frasier and seinfleld !"
19242,"for sure , all great shows . did you ever watch green lantern the movie ?"
19243,"no miss that , do you know who took jack blacks place ?"
19244,i think it was ryan reynolds . the movie would have been way better with ryan reynolds in it ! what do you think ?
19245,did you mean way better with jack black ? i like them both . they both make me laugh ! i loved ryan reynolds in best friends ! a christmas classic !
19246,lol for sure ! do you read any good books ?
19247,i love to read . i find it so relaxing when i can find the time . my favorite place is on the beach under an umbrella ! lol
19248,"man that sounds so good right now . it is 20 degrees where i am right now , lol . i like books with romantic kissing"
19249,"really , apparently its a recent development ! lol winston churchill won the nobel prize not for peace but for literature ."
19250,"you're right , ancient greek never wrote about it . that is so interesting about churchill , i would never have guessed that , great chatting with you !"
19251,"yes , you too ! i wonder how many medals we won in the olympics for painting and sculpture ? have good night !"
19252,"i wonder too , lol ! bye !"
19253,"hi , have your heard of j . r . r . tolkien ?"
19254,yes i have . i haven't read any of his literature . i have watched the moveis the hobbit and the lord of the rings though that are based off of hisworks .
19255,"ok , i have seen lord of the rings as well . i didn't realize he was a poet though or a professor ."
19256,"i definitely did not know he wasa professor . there was actually supposed to be a sequel to lord of the rings that j . r . r . tolkien wrote , but after 13 pages he abandoned it ."
19257,i bet it would have been good if he had finished it . i guess it makes sense he was a close friend of c . s . lewis .
19258,that's really interesting . i wonder why tolkien was appointed a commanderof the order of the british empire by the queen at the time .
19259,he was probably well liked by the monarch .
19260,what kind of literature do you like to read ?
19261,i like modern fiction best though i would love to read the novels written for the annual contest where writers come up with the worst possible opening sentence .
19262,literature was an olympic event from 1912 from 1952 . that might have been interesting to observe as well .
19263,true . i find it interesting that the fda burned 6 tons of literature because of censorship .
19264,"yes , i wonder what it was that they thought they had to censor ."
19265,me too . winston churchill won a nobel prize for literature in 1953 .
19266,do you like to read literature that has elements of comedy ?
19267,yes i love to laugh and love comedy .
19268,the origins of the term comedy are found in ancient greece .
19269,i can believe that . did you know that comedy central has cancelled more than 100 shows since it started in 1989 ?
19270,"no , i wonder why that is . political satire is still big today . in athenian democracy , voters' opinions were influenced by political satire performed by comic poets ."
19271,yeah the political stuff is mostly funny though it does alienate audiences on occasion .
19272,i think it also has a lot of influence in the modern era on voters .
19273,true ! good chat !
19274,nice to talk to you . i think i'm going to unwind with some light comedy shows right now .
19275,sounds like a plan !
19276,are you have fan of star trek ?
19277,"i love star trek . i grew up watching the next generation and ds9 , then later watched the original series . how about you ?"
19278,same here . have you by chance watched the new star trek discovery on cbs online .
19279,i haven't because i didn't hear many positive reviews about it . have you watched it ?
19280,many i love it . the two main characters are two of my favorite tv actresses . one is from walking dead and the other is chinese and she played in crouching tiger hidden dragon .
19281,"i didn't know that ! maybe i should give watching it a shot . i heard that the supporting cast was pretty good , but the main characters were lacking , so it's refreshing to hear an alternate view ."
19282,yeah check it out for yourself very nice plot into the next season as well . but i am a fan of the originals though .
19283,do they link discovery to any of the originals with old characters or recurring enemies ?
19284,"im telling you your going to love it , i don't want to give anything away and its online so you can watch the first season in it's entirety . do you watch netflix ?"
19285,i have a netflix subscription ever since i cut the cord on cable . so much cheaper ! is discovery available on netflix ?
19286,i don't believe so but you can watch it on cbs . com . you know the reason why reed hasting created netflix ?
19287,just guessing based off personal experience was it because cable was too expensive ?
19288,no it was because he had a late fee from blockbuster if im nit mistaken .
19289,i was close ! it was about money after all . i wonder how much he's earned since he got inspired by that late fee .
19290,well they have 137 million total subscribers worldwide and 58 . 46 million in the us alone .
19291,"wow ! i've heard they're worth something like 2 billion , too . that would pay a lot of late fees , haha ."
19292,that's for sure ! from 9am to 12am netflix accounts for 33 percent of the bandwidth in north america .
19293,that's crazy . how much bandwidth must they take up during their peak hours during the day ?
19294,well them and youtube take up half the peak hour traffic in north america .
19295,"that's amazing to think about . now that it's expanded internationally , it's just going to grow bigger , too ."
19296,yeah im sure blockbuster is kicking themselves for not purchasing it for a mere 50m . nice chatting with you .
19297,nice chatting with you too . i'll definitely check out star trek discovery !
19298,do you watch netflix ?
19299,hi ! i do watch and love netflix . i'm proud to say i'm one of the reasons netflix accounts for 33 percent of all of north america's bandwidth from 9pm to 12am . ha ! what about you ?
19300,"me too , i am currently watching it right now lol . did you ever watch lilyhammer ?"
19301,"i can't say that i have . but i have watched star trek . in fact , i think it's funny that william shatner and carrie fischer had a star trek vs star wars fued going on that george takei tried to mitigate !"
19302,lol i never knew that . lilyhammer was netflix's first original show
19303,"that is awesome ! netflix has certainly come a long way over the years . and now today , both youtube and netflix account for half the peak internet traffic in north america ! that is wild , isn't it ?"
19304,i bet it does lol ! did you ever hear how netflix started ?
19305,"i heard it was because reed hastings racked up a 40 late fee with apollo 13 on vhs , right ? it's a good thing that happened . ha !"
19306,yep it was apollo 13 at blockbuster . now reed is laughing to the bank lol .
19307,"agreed ! and even more humiliating , blockbuster had a chance to buy netflix for 50 million and today , the company is worth 2 billion . that's kind of sad . blockbuster missed out big time !"
19308,"ouch , they missed out huge ! i heard netflix is like 21 billion dollars in debt because of all their new content . i think it will be paid off quickly though"
19309,hopefully so ! i do know they also spend 20 times more on postage than bandwidth as well . i wonder if that could be a reason why they're so far in debt as well ?
19310,"that is a good point , i wonder how many people actually get dvds delivered to them still . i wonder how much more money they could make if china was able to stream it"
19311,"that is a good question ! but not just china , also syria , crimea and north korea . they already have 137 million subscribers , i can only imagine how many million more they'd have if netflix was available in those countries !"
19312,"right , i mean china has like the most people on this planet lol ! oh well , maybe some day . back to your shatner comment before , are you a star wars or star trek fan"
19313,i'm probably more star trek . ha ! one of the reasons why is because stephen hawking is the first and only person to portray himself in the star trek universe !
19314,"interesting , i never really watched star trek . i feel there were so many different versions , but i will definitely check it out"
19315,there definitely is ! are you also a fan of science fiction by chance ? i am and i've been wanting to read starship troopers since it's the first scifi novel to make the reading lists of three us military branches ! it must be a great book !
19316,"i read it , it was great . it was nice seeing the movie after to get the graphic effect . i recommend it ! it was so nice chatting with you !"
19317,"i'll definitely have to check it out ! on a similar note , i love how nasa actually has a list of space technology terms for writers to use in science fiction stories . that is very nice of them ! well it was nice chatting with you as well ! hope you have a great evening , friend !"
19318,that is awesome ! enjoy your evening too !
19319,"reading about shoes , did you know that dry tea bags absorb odors in smelly shoes ?"
19320,"yes , i thought that was interesting as well . my son is an athlete and has smelly shoes ."
19321,well then maybe that could help . steve smith leave his cleats after each game to raise awareness of homelessness . i did not know that either but i do not follow sports .
19322,"steve smith retired a few years ago and i remember hearing about that . it is not well known , but i like that he is raising awareness ."
19323,"yes , it is a topic that needs awareness , so many people don't see the problem . i can not imagine spending thousands of dollars on one pair of shoes ."
19324,"i can't either , but it is capitalism at is best or worst . people can make a lot of money and have the right to spend it as they wish ."
19325,yes they can . personally i would want to help others . . imagine the rip curl clothing company makes clothing in n korea but the tags say china .
19326,i'm surprised . i have a rip curl swim shirt so i'm not too happy to support that company .
19327,"i was surprised to hear that as well . i will have to research that more . apple had a clothing line in 1986 , i did not know that either ."
19328,i didn't know that about apple as well . i don't remember seeing any apple branded clothing back then . i find it interesting that there is a store in alabama selling unclaimed baggage from airports .
19329,no i do not recall seeing apple clothing then either . i also found the store in alabama selling unclaimed baggage . i would guess they have to wait some before getting this from airports but i do not know .
19330,i'm surprised it is only in alabama . why alabama ? you would think there would be stores in all states .
19331,i was thinking the same thing . perhaps it will catch on in other areas . think it is great how johnny depp travels with his jack sparrow costume so he can visit kids in hospitals .
19332,"it is good that johnny depp does that . you hear negative news about him , i'm glad he helps sick kids in that way ."
19333,"absolutely , it is always good to hear something positive . especially when the media focuses on the negative so much . how about a job wearing a panda costume to research pandas ?"
19334,that is interesting about panda researchers . i wonder what the reason is for them to do that .
19335,"maybe it has something to do with not wanting the pandas to get used to humans or perhaps the researchers think the pandas will act different . sean bean is scared of flying , so am i lol ."
19336,flying is the safest form of travel . i travel for work so i fly all the time . there was a jodie foster movie where sean bean is a pilot so that is ironic .
19337,"wow , that is very interesting that you travel for work ! interesting about the movie with sean bean doing a movie as a pilot but yet it says he is afraid of flying . you just never know . maybe he changed his feelings for flying over time ."
19338,"i prefer not to , but do enjoy visiting new cities and countries . i doubt any of the scenes was shot while flying for sean bean . interesting to read about facts about people ."
19339,it must be wonderful seeing other countries and cities . i love to learn about other places and people but i do it only by reading and listening to others who have gone traveling . be safe in your travels
19340,nice chatting with you . god bless .
19341,hi do you like fashion ?
19342,"hi , i'm very into shoes and clothes , actually . i like basic sneakers , but it seems like the less typical types still get more attention . for example , there are wizard of ozinspired shoes that use gps to guide you home when you click your toes together ."
19343,"hi , wow shoe with gps , that sounds like too much ! i would like to get a 5000 year old pair of shoes . they do perform better than new ones !"
19344,or maybe some of the original highheeled shows worn by persian cavalry soldiers in the 9th century .
19345,"poor guys . . maybe il'l just stay with sandals , low cost , a simple sole and a strap ."
19346,"yes , high fashion shows costing hundreds or thousands of dollars seem unnecessary to me ."
19347,that is true ! i learned a good tip for smelly shoes . . put dry tea bags inside them will absorb the odor !
19348,that's interesting ! another tip is to pay someone to break in your shoes to make them comfortable the way queen elizabeth does .
19349,"wow , i wish i could do that . lol . . . did you know how many pairs of pointe shoes ballet dancers use in a week !"
19350,"i'm sure it's a lot , since they're put under so much stress . did you know that bill nye actual holds a patent for a type of pointe shoes ?"
19351,i did not know ! they can use up to 4 pairs of pointe shoes ! isn't that a lot ?
19352,"sounds like bill nye made a solid invention investment , then ! another invention is actual asbestos clothing ; the greeks made it and it was almost as valuable as gold , at least until they figured out that asbestos costs outweigh its benefits ."
19353,that is lots of creativity ! did you know had a clothing line ?
19354,"who did ? i do know that a bulletproof clothing mogul actually shoots his employees to test and quality control his product , which seems a bit extreme ."
19355,"wow i meant applehad a clothing line back in 1986 . . . about the bulletproof test , that is totally crazy !"
19356,"i guess they still have a chance to get into wearable tech , although it doesn't seem like their watches are as hot of an item as they used to be . some people like tradition ; for example , there's an african tribe that still wears victorian clothes after having adopted them when they were introduced by german occupiers ."
19357,that is cute ! i would love to see that ! i found something interesting about a peculiar store in alabama
19358,oh really ? is it more interesting than people who used old faithful as a natural laundry machine ?
19359,"lol , we are finding all sorts of crazy things ! well this store sells stuff found in unclaimed baggage in airports !"
19360,"that's terrible ! i guess some people just get tired of waiting , so at least it's not going to waste in the airport . once a man wore 70 items of clothing in a chinese airport to avoid the baggage charge , although i guess he also could've been worried about them ending up lost haha"
19361,"that is a little extreme but at least he tried hahaha to avoid the charges . well it was a nice chat , have a good one"
19362,hello how are you ? do you like rock music ? viktor tsoi kept his job in the boiler room of his apartment even after becoming the biggest rock star in russian history
19363,"i do like rock . i had a friend who had a night job in a boiler room . he did not have to do anything but listen for an alarm . he did his homework , so that is a pretty easy job . paid to do nothing"
19364,thats awesome ! the state rock song of oklahoma is ' do you realize ? ' by the flaming lips
19365,i am from oklahoma originally . i had no idea . that must have been an amusing day in the state legislature .
19366,yeah ! rock band whitesnake has had over 50 members throughout its history ; so many that the list has its own wikipedia page .
19367,the group was a style as much as a group . old time gospel quartets changed members from time to time also .
19368,thats a lot of turnover !
19369,i agree . something must have been wrong with the financial shares for the members .
19370,a hanson song became a most requested track on a chicago altrock radio station because djs did not reveal the band
19371,that is a riot . people would have been embarrassed to know they were listening to hanson .
19372,sonic the hedgehog was originally supposed to be a member of a rock band and have a blond haired human girlfriend named madonna
19373,"i am surprised at how normal some rockers are . however , they tend toward drugs much more than others . none of the beatles could read music . that is strange ."
19374,thats crazy ! the beatles have the best selling album of the 2000's
19375,their music is excellent even though their particular renditions of it are not as good as that of many later performers . you can go if this finishes it for you . bye
19376,i don't think it will let me finish yet . lol . did you know the beatles song ' come together ' was written for timothy leary's 1969 california governor campaign
19377,no . i did not . i apologize for the bad advice . imagine having to stop touring because your amplifiers can't make you music louder than the screaming .
19378,"wow . . thats unreal , or a musicians dream . the fan love them lol beatles drummer ringo starr was illiterate for most of his childhood because he missed three years of school due to tuberculosis and peritonitis"
19379,"i know that only agent 1 can hit the 'done' button . so , how about a ballet dancer wearing out 4 pairs of shoes in a week ?"
19380,"its not lit up yet . i didn't know that , that seems like a lot of money on shoes1"
19381,i know . however the material in those shoes seems flimsy . how about michael jackson owning a patent ?
19382,been good talking to you !
19383,did you know the state rock song of oklahoma is do you realize ?
19384,no idea . and never knew that elvis costello was considered punk rock .
19385,another interesting thing is whitesnake had over 50 members in its history .
19386,ah loved whitesnake . love that led zep never named their 4th album just to mess with the rock press who they hated . zoso was a symbol on it . . . haha
19387,and i like that sonic the hedgehog was supposed to be a rock band . that is my sons favorite game .
19388,that's cool . wonder why termites eat through wood 2 times faster when rock music is on . if had termites at my house it would be rubble .
19389,lol . and did you know tupac danced ballet in high school . wonder what his rapper friend thought of that .
19390,that's cool . i don't think we realize how talented and hard working song artist are . a lot of pop singers have opera training early on .
19391,that is interesting . i did not know bruce lee was a dancer and won the cha cha championship in 1958 in hong kong
19392,wow . i never realized that the beatles broke up before any of them turned 30 . we think of them as so iconic and mature . guess not
19393,and i did not know ringo starr was illiterate for most of his childhood
19394,indeed . i'd like to find that webcam at abbey rd to see people stopping traffic to take recreation photos . funny
19395,it is strange as famous as the beatles were they could not read music
19396,thats crazy i am not sure anyone could get away with that now . the beatles used the word love in their songs 613 times .
19397,that is a lot of times to use the word love . and it is crazy they stopped touring because the amplification couldn't handle the women screaming
19398,yeah rock n roll exploded in the 50's . so much that the grammy awards were invented to take attention away from it .
19399,did you know professional ballet dancers go through 3 pairs of pointe shoes in a week
19400,i believe it ! i just saw that there are ballet slippers that make drawings from the dancers movements too .
19401,and the beatles have the best selling album of the 2000's . didn't they stop recording together way before that ?
19402,ha i believe so . beatle mania lives on !
19403,i think it is neat that michael jackson had a patent on his leaning move
19404,cool . he couldn't patent the moon walk because it was done by a tap dancer named bill bailey in 1955 !
19405,i never would have guessed that professional ballerinas go through so many shoes .
19406,that's nuts . i wonder what they do with them after the fact . seems like a waste to toss that many .
19407,agreed . ballerina shoes are pretty things aren't they ? i guess they are always ripping tears in them .
19408,maybe stephon marbury can bring his starbury line back with recycled ballet slippers .
19409,maybe . the thing that actually stuck out to me most in these sections was the johnny depp thing . is that actually true ? are people still that big of a fan of the jack sparrow character ? lol
19410,i feel like that's probably true like 5 years ago . it seems like something he would have done before he hit a wall and lost his way . who doesn't love jack sparrow ! !
19411,"never seen any of the pirates movies so i guess i don't love jack sparrow lol i do like johnny depp though . other than the panda researcher thing his costumes are the only interesting thing in that costume section . well , maybe labyrinth but i have not seen that movie either . . ."
19412,"if you've ever got time on your hands pirates is great mind numbing fodder . can't take it too seriously though , too much eyeliner . the panda thing actually made me laugh out loud . the mental visual is too much . i wonder how long they hang out in the jungle in a panda suit ? it's got to be soooo hot ."
19413,"the panda thing makes me uncomfortable . like you said , being in the heat or even worse with terrible humidity . i guess pandas feel threatened or scared by humans or something ."
19414,that's major commitment to research . i commend them for that . it kind of creeps me out that the cast of firefly has to wear used costumes . . .
19415,firefly was that show with one season correct ? i had no idea anyone in that show would wear costumes . i assumed they were just blandly dressed actors like every other show .
19416,i've never seen it . it just seems weird to wear stuff that other people sweat in .
19417,i never watched it either . surely they washed them a few times . are starship troopers a star trek thing ?
19418,"starship troopers i've seen . it's this really bad late 90's scifi movie with casper van dien , denise richards and doogie howser ."
19419,"that sounds awful . doogie howser md ? oh , and going back to sweat for a minute you could always step into the sweat from the gods if you wear the 5000 year old shoes ."
19420,it's pretty brutal . the cheese factor is on another level . . . kind of like 5000 year old toe cheese of the gods . . . see what i did there ?
19421,like howard the duck ? 5000 year old toe cheese makes me hungry .
19422,"wooooooooow ! howard the duck ! that is some serious old school cheese , but yes , it's totally on that level ! ! ! cheese is always a great snack . especially if it's spicy"
19423,what cheese is spicy ? pepperjack ? lol
19424,"pepperjack , habanero havarti . . . i like to chop up jalapenos and mix it in cream cheese and use it as filling for jalapeno poppers . now i'm hungry ."
19425,i have no idea what habanero havarti is . now i want to go eat a stuffed pepper and watch crap movies instead of being on the internet lol
19426,sounds like plan to me ! it was great chatting with you ! !
19427,same to you !
19428,": ,"
19429,do you like comedies ?
19430,i do ! what's your favorite comedy ?
19431,"i'm a fan of bill murray , what about you ?"
19432,he's pretty funny . he thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy .
19433,i liked him in groundhog day .
19434,i haven't seen that one yet . do you like to read ?
19435,"sometimes i read , but not as often as i used to ."
19436,me too . life just gets so busy sometimes it's hard to find time for a book . do you like any of j . r . r tolkiens books ?
19437,"i've never read any of them , are they any good ?"
19438,he wrote the hobbit and lord of the rings books . i've read of few of them and seen some of the movies . they are pretty good .
19439,"interesting , i think i've seen a few of the movies . apparently all of the names are lifted from a viking text ."
19440,he apparently wrote 13 pages of a sequel called the new shadow but abandoned it . i wonder why ?
19441,i'm not sure . did you know the fda burned six tons of literature ?
19442,that's crazy . in greek literate there was no romantic kissing as it is a recent development .
19443,"interesting , i wonder how recent ?"
19444,me too . kissing is kind of strange concept if you think about it too hard .
19445,there was once a contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel .
19446,i wonder what some of them said . i'm sure some of them were pretty funny .
19447,yeah they probably were . winston churchill won a nobel prize in literature .
19448,that's interesting . painting was an olympic event in 1912 .
19449,i can believe that . sounds like it would be cool to watch . nice chatting with you .
19450,"hello , do you watch star trek ?"
19451,i love it . i grew up on the older shows like the original series and the next generation . what about you ?
19452,"i dont really watch it . i have seen a few episodes though . i recently learned some stuff about it . like , teleportation was used because it cost too much to get shots of spaceships landing lol"
19453,"really ? ha , to think it set off such a trend in science fiction of teleportation devices . i bet they made a lot of money on that moneysaving decision ."
19454,"i know right , and who ever thought of that was so creative , just to save money ! ! ! amazing !"
19455,it's pretty amazing how big the franchise has grown too . i doubt gene roddenberry ever knew how big his original tv show idea would grow .
19456,i hear stephen hawking is the only one to play themselves in star trek .
19457,"he earned it with his amazing scientific research . i didn't know he'd been in star trek , though . i wonder which of the series he was in . there were so many !"
19458,do you watch netflix ?
19459,"i have a subscription , but i don't watch it much . do you ?"
19460,"yeah i use it a lot . love the service . apparently , they spend more on postage than bandwidth lol"
19461,"that's surprising . it must be worth it , though , considering they're worth over 2 billion now ."
19462,"yeah , i cant believe blockbuster turned down an offer to buy them . i remember them starting their own service , obviously it failed ."
19463,"blockbuster made the same mistake a few companies have , turning down a chance at the online market and not realizing that everyone is going digital ."
19464,"yeah , guess a lot of companies misread how much convenience was worth . the tech boom came around pretty fast ."
19465,"yeah , it was a short leap from science fiction to reality for a lot of newer technologies . i doubt it'll be long before netflix cuts back on their physical disc rental service and goes solely to streaming ."
19466,"i agree , plus its costing them money ."
19467,"they probably still make money off the rentals , just not as much as off digital content . if the rentals were an actual negative , they'd have cut them out already ."
19468,i hear that netflix and youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in north america !
19469,"imagine how many people must be tuned in at once ! they've gone international too , so i wonder how much it is all across the globe ."
19470,seriously ! that is a lot of people . youtube has so much content !
19471,google was smart to buy youtube when they did . it was a much better decision than blockbuster made about netflix !
19472,"hello , do you like star trek ?"
19473,"hello . i am not , but i hear dr . martin luther king was really into it . i keep meaning to watch the new one , on cbs . i'm a fan of sonequa martin green , she left the walking dead for this new series ."
19474,oh i see . well star trek seems to be influential that the first space shuttle was named after the ship in the series
19475,was it ? i never knew that . i was surprised to hear that king abullah of jordan had a nonspeaking role on it at one time .
19476,"did not know that , pretty cool . hawking was the only person that actually portrayed himself in it"
19477,"stephen hawking ? that's awesome . he was a great mind . i saw a documentary on him ' the theory of everything ' , on netflix a while ago . i think that's the only thing i watched twice . well , that and the fireplace ."
19478,"he was amazing . speaking of netflix , do you know how that business got started ?"
19479,"i do not . i do know that they offered blockbuster the chance to buy the company , and they turned it down ."
19480,"yes that was not a smart decision , they could have bought it for only 50 million and make billions now"
19481,very true . i would love to have the job of ' tagger ' for netflix . i can watch t . v . all day and tag content .
19482,i would love that too honestly . they spend a lot on bandwidth but still spend even more n postage
19483,"very true . it's fascinating that they monitor the markets in europe , to see which shows are pirated the most , so they can purchase them ."
19484,"wow , did not know that . but it seems now netflix makes up half of the peak traffic in north america"
19485,"i believe it . i was watching a movie on it the other night , based on a bradbury novel . i was surprised to learn that he wrote the script for epcot's spaceship earth ."
19486,cool . do you enjoy reading science fiction ?
19487,i do . bradbury is a favorite of mine . i recently read ender's game . have you seen the movie ?
19488,no i have not actually . but i heard that starship trooper is recommended even by military branches
19489,i've never seen it . i think it's interesting that spock was supposed to be a female character .
19490,"wow , i cannot imagine that . do you know how the word robotics was coined ?"
19491,"i do not , do you ?"
19492,it was an accident by isaac asimov back in 1941 . thanks for the chat
19493,"hello there , did you know that scientists in italy do checkups and ice treatments on this man who died 5 , 300 years ago ? imagine that !"
19494,"wow , that is crazy . the emperor of japan apparently is a scientist and still publishing . what a guy"
19495,really ? two roles for one person he must be very busy . another scientist who has two careers would be harrison schmitt . he is the only scientist to walk on the moon !
19496,that is pretty cool . good for him . another scientist was able to divide two 8digit numbers at the age of 6
19497,"i can barely even divide 7 . that person must have got into harvard . speaking of harvard , did you know that harvard scientists managed to store an animation of a galloping horse onto the dna of a bacteria ? i found that really fascinating ."
19498,wow that is pretty advanced and sound intriguing . do you know how www was invented ?
19499,i believe that it was invented by an english scientist in 1989 . that scientist was working in switzerland . do you know anymore details on how it was invented ? i am really curious to know .
19500,"just a bit like , he was working for cern which is a european statefunded organization that does research"
19501,really ? that is pretty cool . i found it very interesting that a store in alabama only sells items found in unclaimed baggage at the airport .
19502,"that is something , i would like to check that out at some point . even apple had a clothing line back in the day"
19503,that is the same as how amazon used to be an online book retailer . it's hard to imagine how much that they have grown over these few decades .
19504,"that is true , they are a giant now . do you know when pilgrims wear black clothes ?"
19505,"no i did not know that ! furthermore , rip curl is a company that manufactures in north korea but labels it as made in china ."
19506,hahah go figure . do you know how fashion aficionados can tell if you need your clothes tailored ?
19507,"interesting . speaking of fashion , did you know that british politicians had to wear a top if when they made a point on the house of commons ? this was mandatory up until 1998 !"
19508,that is strange to me but i guess it worked for them . do you know how the tipping of the hat originated or .
19509,did it originate from knights raising their visors in order to show friendliness in the battlefield ?
19510,yes that was it . do you know which was the most famous hat in the old west ?
19511,"i am not sure , but i do know that the party hat was derived from dunce caps ."
19512,nice . the most famous one was the bowler cap and not the cowboy hat as we are lead to believe
19513,"ah , so that is what it was . in the past hat's were used to indicate social status . i am glad that we have evolved from that ."
19514,i am very glad about that too . nice chatting !
19515,do u like science
19516,i do . . . i try to keep up with all thats going on in the science world the best i can
19517,there are scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection much like different species do on earth .
19518,how do you think all this climate change is going to affect the universe as a whole more so than just earth ?
19519,idont believe in it
19520,do you believe in newton and kepler's research work into how the planet works ?
19521,no im a flat earthier
19522,really ? that is interesting . i didn't anyone still had that opinion anymore given all the evidence we have now .
19523,all of nasa images are cgi there not real and common sense and simple science says its flat
19524,i wish i could get on one of the private space missions and see for myself and maybe see how truly cold a star actually is
19525,im a hardcore bible believer and according to descriptions given we live inside of a snow globe type structure the ancients jews also believed this
19526,so you agree with the hologram theory then ?
19527,i agree with multiple dimensions yes
19528,"i myself am not a big believe in the bible , no offense ."
19529,thats ok i wont hold it against you lol but i do encourage it because if nothing else there is lots of unknown science in it
19530,i agree with you there . the bible is the worlds best book
19531,"did you know in psalms david described the stars singing but it wasnt until recently our scientist figured it out , and also did you know that when drs check your blood to find out your diseases its bc one dr learned the bible said the the life of the flesh is in the blood"
19532,"i had not realized that until now . i thought it was common knowledge , basic science from prehistoric days"
19533,i have alot more but i want get into that im kind of a nerd about these thing
19534,do you like the old or new testament better ?
19535,both are equal thanks have a good day
19536,hello . have you ever heard of akihito ?
19537,the japanese emperor ? yeah .
19538,i recently learned that he is a scientist and still publishes papers even though he is emperor .
19539,that's cool . he probably viewed having to take on the job of emperor as a burden that kept him from living the way he wanted .
19540,he just might have at that . did you know that the term scientist was coined by a theologian and philosopher ?
19541,"not until just now . i knew it was called ' natural philosophy ' until recently , but not who was responsible for the change ."
19542,"yeah , william whewell did it in 1833 . i would have thought someone specializing in science would have come up with it ."
19543,i guess a lot of names for things have a lot of weird origins . i wonder who came up with the idea for ' project steve . '
19544,what is project steve ?
19545,it's a project of scientists who all support evolution and oppose teaching creationism but they have to be named steve !
19546,seriously ? how odd ! i think another odd thing as there was only one scientist on the moon .
19547,"i guess that stands to reason . i figured they were all career air force pilots , given the way the space program recruited ."
19548,true . it's a shame though . i imagine there was a whole host of scientists wanting to go up there .
19549,yeah . at least the space shuttle made getting into space a lot easier for civilians of all types .
19550,"i hope one day it is affordable for all of us . maybe it'll be like the internet , slow to start but now fast and highly accessible ."
19551,"yeah , if they ever build a space shuttle to get people out of earth's gravity well cheaply , space will be accessible to a lot more people ."
19552,"i'm putting my money on elon musk . then again , the internet was invented by an englishman so you never know ."
19553,"musk has demonstrated that low cost tech is possible , but i hope that it's open source and p2p projects that actually take the principle and run with it rather than a corporation ."
19554,"hmm , i hadn't thought of that . i'd like that too . then harrison schmitt won't be the only scientist on the moon ."
19555,"i remember seeing a science fiction story about an opensource moon project called open shot . there was a contest to see who could accomplish the first nongovernment moon landing and most of the competitors were corporate , but the winner was a spacecraft called the stallman ."
19556,well a long time ago there was a short lived tv series about a man who built a ship in his backyard and took trips to space .
19557,have you heard any news about scientists lately ?
19558,something about dna of bacteria being stored in a gif animation . you ?
19559,"harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon , but they are planning to put a base station on the moon soon ."
19560,"i wonder how they are going to do that , since no one has been to the moon since the 60's ? maybe the emperor of japan knows , as he still publishes papers ."
19561,"i am not sure , but it was not really that long ago , i mean , the world wide web was invented in 1989"
19562,it has been almost 60 years since anyone stepped on the moon . thats a long time . even by cern's standards .
19563,"look how far we came in that time , an iphone has more computing power than anything they had back then , we can do it , apple had a clothing line in 1986 but now is so powerful of a company"
19564,fascinating . i think it's hilarious that people think that the cowboy hat was most popular in the old west . it was really the bowler .
19565,cowboy hats are so cool and most people don't know much about them plus . the tipping of a hat goes back to knights raising of their face masks .
19566,"yes , they did that to show they were friendly ."
19567,"exactly , i bought a really nice hat at the unclaimed baggage store in alabama , have you ever heard of it or been ?"
19568,i have been there . i bought a camera and most of my mardi gras outfits there several years ago . it's huge . i even found a vintage apple sweater .
19569,"wow , that's a great find . we bought nice luggage there and a computer there"
19570,"i'm surprised they checked a computer . in 1908 , a law was passed , regulating the length of hat pins ."
19571,"i never thought that suffragettes would use them as weapons , surely they had other options ."
19572,"i would have , had i of lived back then . there was zero reasons why we couldn't vote , and some men were very violent towards us . i found out that the hats bishops wear , are called mitres . that's a weird name ."
19573,"that is a weird name , i guess it was a lot different back then , until 1998 brittish politicians had to wear a top hat if making an order"
19574,"people always think that pilgrims only wore black . they were fashion forward , and only wore it for special occasions ."
19575,"they were good at making clothes , i like how a coller gap can tell if you get clothes tailored"
19576,only those truly schooled in fashion and style are able to tell that without asking .
19577,"the clothes were better back then too , unlike the stuff made in china with a made in korea label"
19578,"rip curl is a north korean label , and is legally not for sale due to sanctions . so , that hardly qualifies ."
19579,"bye , have a great day !"
19580,"thank you , you too"
19581,1954 was a long time ago . a lot had occurred around that time .
19582,"albert einstein wrote the letter tow a philosopher in 1954 , that went into the public auction in 2008 ."
19583,i believe the end of wwii was fresh on everyone's mind . its interesting that young albert was devout .
19584,"yes , after the second world war we need peace and human should respect human . love is the greatest gift to man kind ."
19585,"the letter sold in 2008 for 404 , 000 . if the letter was written by some one other than albert it would never have gotten so much . vanilla ice , 1 . obama , 1 , 000 ?"
19586,"it is very interesting . the post in 1985 , einstein believed in what he called a cosmic religion ."
19587,"yes , i do not think that einstein thought no god at all , but rather a part f the universe that is difficult to understand . i think he was criticizing religious leaders on some points ."
19588,there are stars in the known universe that are cold enough to be touched by the human hand .
19589,you first . the density of the star would be such that your not getting your hand back . the observable universe is filled with wondrous things .
19590,there is a region of space that may be pulling galaxies outside the observable universe .
19591,"the heliocentric model of the solar system was a bad idea . flat earthers go a step to far . we should never have come out of the trees . if we could travel to this region of space , would you ?"
19592,yes i also . the big bang theory is the prevailing cosmological explosion is the development of the earth .
19593,"well , ok i guess . i wonder if albert einstein charged 1 to sign his 404 , 000 letter ."
19594,the letter showed up again on ebay for an asking price at least 3 million but apparently never sold .
19595,"in december of this year , it will be auctioned by christie's . they expect 1 million . if i had a million , there are other things . still it would be interesting ."
19596,what is that thing ?
19597,"the other things ? for a million ? i dont know , experiences are the best . travel to south america and see the rain forest . the estate of einstein earns 18 , 000 , 000 annually ."
19598,"albert einstein was asked to be the president of israel , which he was declined . do you know ?"
19599,i imagine such a presidency would present a moral issue for the man . he was about fair and equal treatment for people . he was a member of naacp .
19600,i think that we would understand each other quite well if we talked about the concrete things .
19601,"yes , e is mc2 and 2 plus 2 equals 5 . have a good day ."
19602,"hi , how are doing this fine evening ?"
19603,"good , how are you doing ?"
19604,i'm great ! what do you know of the man albert einstein ?
19605,"his estate is still earning over 18 , 000 , 000 each year ! nice !"
19606,i wonder what they do with the money . he charged 1 to sign his autograph . he donated all this money to charity .
19607,hopefully some of it still goes to charity . he was a member of the naacp .
19608,he was an interesting guy . he wanted to help others . he declined the offer to be president of israel . i guess he wasn't attracted to power .
19609,a letter that he wrote rejecting god and religion will be placed up for auction .
19610,he probably saw the problems with religion and the divisions that it can create . i wonder what he wrote on the message he put in the time capsule .
19611,i guess we just have to wait a few thousand years to find out ! haha . he said that god is a product of human weakness .
19612,we want to believe that there is a being that looks out for our well being . we hold this belief despite no evidence . i like jefferson's idea of a bible without the miracles .
19613,"i do believe in god because i have felt things that cannot be explained . einstein did however believe that there is a lot in the physical universe that is a mystery . he often wrote of god , but for him , this was the universe itself ."
19614,"i probably favor his thinking more than that of religions . many things are not yet explained , but i worry that people will divide themselves over how they choose to explain the unexplained . it's interesting that it was not uncommon for students in the us to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education ."
19615,"i agree , it does divide . einstein did also say that he felt religion was necessary to guide people between what was right and wrong ."
19616,"moral decisions are difficult , and it helps to have a welldeveloped code that can guide a community . teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams are the only two us presidents that did not use a bible at their swearingin ceremonies . i wonder what ethics they used as their guide ."
19617,"hmm , interesting . i wonder too . einstein believed that people can understand each other quite well if they talk about concrete things ."
19618,"it's easier to find common ground with the concrete . physics examines the concrete , yet i think einstein knew that it was not enough to explain life to human beings ."
19619,"yes , there is still disagreemenet even among physicists about where the universe came from ."
19620,"not knowing everything keeps life interesting . anyway , i enjoyed chatting !"
19621,"yes , enjoy life . you only get one ! nice chatting !"
19622,have a good one !
19623,how is your universe today ?
19624,my universe is great how was yours ? i'm thankful for the ancient greeks and indian philosophers who started to gain knowledge about our universe .
19625,although they were geocentric
19626,yes that's right . more precise observations were made by copernicus who developed the heliocentric model .
19627,"yes , and isaac newton built upon his theories developing the law of gravitation"
19628,yes he did as well well as tycho brahe and johannes kepplers laws of planetary motion .
19629,did you now there are scientists that think the universe evolved through natural selection ?
19630,i think that is very interesting to compare our universe to the animals here on earth .
19631,i am a little unclear on the theory as there is only one universe that we know so how is natural selection involved ?
19632,yes it's based on evidence such as fossils . another theory suggests that the universe may exist inside a blackhole .
19633,how about the theory there is only one electron in the universe ?
19634,yes i don't understand that theory at all . it is so easy to prove wrong . if you could fold a piece of paper in and half 103 times it would be a thick as the observable universe . hard to picture that one .
19635,wow . what about that is one giant superhologram ?
19636,"i've actually never heard that one ? i don't even understand it really . apparently the deepest note in the universe is emitted by blackhole , producing a note 57 octaves below middle c ."
19637,whoa . . . . there are stars that are cold enough to touch !
19638,"i would love to touch a star . speaking of cold , there's a cold spot in the cosmic microwave background that has been theorized to be a link to a parallel universe ."
19639,"wow , scary . einsteins god was the universe itself !"
19640,yes you are right . he was a genius . he released his special theory of relativity at age 26 .
19641,way ahead of his time . . . passed away in 1955 . good chat and take care .
19642,yoda from star wars was actually modeled after the appearance of albert einstein . have a great day nice chatting with you too .
19643,"yes , you too ."
19644,"hi hows it going ? do you like interesting facts about computers ? i read recently that the space shuttles computer run on like 1mb of ram ! isnt that crazy , must be a slow computer ."
19645,"wow that is slow , this says in 1936 the russians made a computer that ran on water , sounds cool actually"
19646,"wow thats beyond me , i have no clue how that would even work lol"
19647,"no me netiher ! also that smoking near apple computers voids the warranty , i know a lot of people at work that wouldn't like to know that"
19648,"that seem odd that smoking would void the warranty , so many people smoke !"
19649,"i know it's weird ! i gues it says i'ts a biohazard , but i've never heard of that with any other product"
19650,just seems weird for a computer warranty lol did you read that transhumanist want to save their minds on computers ? it sound like an episode of black mirror lol
19651,"ha it does , it does sound kind of awesome though , i need to watch that one episode of black mirror i think i've read about it , this says the seahorse is the only fish to have a neck , that seems crazy"
19652,"thats weird , i never knew that . i didnt know that freshwater fish drink through their skin , thats pretty amazing !"
19653,"nope didn't know that , , or that saltwater fish drink through their mouth , i wonder if they ever get tired of a salty taste or if they're just so used to it they don't notice haha"
19654,lol i wonder if the salt makes their mouth dry ? hahah
19655,"haha ya good question ! this says 84 percent of human genes associated with diseases have counterparts in zebrafish , we need to get rid of those genes haha"
19656,"whoa ! thats weird . did you know there is a type of jellyfish and a type of lobster that are immortal ? if not killed of course , but they can literally live foreverrrrr !"
19657,"that is weird they need to put those genes inside me somehow haha , or that the black swallower fish can eat prey twice its length , i can eat that much pizza myself"
19658,"wow , you can eat twice your length in pizza ? thats crazy , you should be entering in some contest of something !"
19659,"haha i should , i would be a great professional eater , the only problem is the weight gain afterwards i'd have to not eat for a week haha"
19660,oh thats true ! gotta go on a diet after every contest lol
19661,"that's the other reason that i need the immortal jellyfish genes inside me , so i can eat my weight in pizza everyday and not die prematurely haha"
19662,"haha that would be perfect for you ! i have no idea how you would do that though , i think you need to make friends with a scientist or something lol go on meetup and join one of those groups ."
19663,"haha yes i will develp an immortal jellyfish formula ! jackie chan probably has access to it considering the stunts he does , also he manages a kpop band apparently"
19664,wow thats interesting . do you like k pop ?
19665,"can't say i've ever listened to it no , i should give it a try i do like most music , what about you ?"
19666,"yeah somewhat . there is a band called bts , they are the most popular k pop band right now , they were doing a tour around the states , i keep seeing them on talk shows so i checked out their music , pretty good . they have one song with nikki minaj too !"
19667,"wow i actually do like nicki minaj , i'll have to check them out , this says north korea has a kpop girl band which is the most popular in the country"
19668,"haha right . hey its been fun chatting , have a good one !"
19669,"hi , do you use the computer a lot ?"
19670,hi . yes i do . i use it basically all day for all sorts of different things . it's hard to believe that computers were originally just calculating devices .
19671,yeah they have come a very long way
19672,"they really have . i mean , think about it . the russians have made a computer that runs on water !"
19673,that is amazing . and the space shuttle computer runs on only 1 mb of ram
19674,"does it really ? that is very surprising . it's hard to believe that computers all started from a simple program , a command to a machine ."
19675,yeah it is for sure . do yu have an apple or a pc
19676,i have a pc . i am not real big on apple products . i've heard they can be problematic . do you have an apple or a pc ?
19677,i have an apple . good thing i do not smoke as it would void its warranty
19678,lol ! i remember hearing something about that before ! isn't smoking around an apple considered a biohazard ?
19679,"yeah it is , i think that is what voids the warranty . crazy"
19680,that is crazy . it's just as crazy as some people hoping to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks .
19681,"yeah , not sure how transhumanists are going to do that but it will be interesting to se"
19682,"i agree . maybe they should start with something smaller to experiment with first . something like a fish perhaps . then again , maybe they should study jellyfish . there's a breed of them that is immortal ."
19683,yeah they have been doing that for a while now but cannot crack their code
19684,"really ? i didn't know that ! i guess fish are more complicated than they seem . i mean , even the way they drink is different . fresh water drink by osmosis and salt water through their mouths ."
19685,yeah that is so cool how they have adapted . there are fish that eat prey twice their size .
19686,"i wonder how they do they do that . now that i think of it , fish do need to be studied more . the zebra fish has genes that are associated with human diseases ."
19687,"yeah , and they are often studies to figure out things about humans , there are lots of studies ."
19688,i like that fish can communicate . they use use acoustic communication which depends on the size and species of the fish .
19689,yeah that is really cool . nice chat
19690,have you seen billy elliot ?
19691,i haven't . i hear it is a musical . have you seen it ?
19692,i have seen the movie at least a dozen times . the musical is playing in arlington though .
19693,that's pretty cool ! i wasn't aware there was a movie . do you like to dance ?
19694,"i do ! the dance number's in the musical are supposed to be spectacular , especially ' angry dance ' in act 1 . dance is a great way to communicate , even outside of musical's ."
19695,"i'm not great at dancing , but i do like watching people dance . bruce lee was the hong kong cha cha champion in 1958 ."
19696,who knew ? tupac was a dancer as well . he did ballet in high school . he even performed in the nutcracker .
19697,that's pretty awesome . i believe there's a special part of the brain that takes in music . babies spontaneously dance when they hear music . i think i read people with memory loss can remember words to songs as well .
19698,"that's crazy ! i wonder if i ever forget stuff , if music will help me . think that's how elton john remember's all his songs ? he has sold over 30 million records ."
19699,"that's crazy , he is quite the legend . they almost cut can you feel the love tonight from the lion king . i'm really glad they didn't !"
19700,me too ! i love that song . it's probably my second favorite song of his behind candle in the wind .
19701,"yeah , it is definitely one of his best . it went on to win an oscar ! i wonder if he will do anything for the new movie ?"
19702,i don't know about the movie but i think he does all the music in the musical . it's a tony winning musical .
19703,"yeah , it's a pretty amazing musical . he preformed with ed sheeran at the grammys because they said ed was not high profile enough ."
19704,"wow ! i love ed sheeran's music , i would have never guessed that . did you know elton john doesn't write all his own music ?"
19705,oh yeah ? i didn't know that . i guess that's a lot of music to write all on your own .
19706,"apparently , most of his songs were wrote by bernie taupin ."
19707,"well , hats off to bernie because he's done a great job too !"
19708,i would say ! he came across him randomly after he failed an audition for some talent search .
19709,that's pretty lucky . the song called your song was given to elton as an upcoming artist .
19710,he's had a great career . it was a nice chat !
19711,it was nice chatting with you too !
19712,do you think you will see the musical now ? you should go this weekend !
19713,i'm really thinking about checking it out ! i really like musicals ! have a nice night !
19714,did you know bruce lee was a great dancer and won hong kong's chacha championship in 1958 ?
19715,"no , i did not know that , but dancing and martial arts are alike when you think about it . it is about coordinated movements ."
19716,"yes , michael jackson has a patent on a device allowing him to lean extremely in some dance moves ."
19717,"yes , there was a peg in the floor and a hole in the sole of his shoes . he had to patent it so he would be the only one to use it ."
19718,babies actually spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile when hitting the beat . how sweet !
19719,"yeah , the appreciation of culture is in our genes it seems every culture has their dance moves and music ."
19720,elton john was actually born reginald kenneth dwight and worked with lyricist bernie taupin since 1967 collaborating on more than 30 albums .
19721,"they have met because elton could not write songs and bernie could not sing , sometime destiny works ."
19722,"yes , did you know that can you feel the love tonight was almost cut from lion king but john campaigned for it to be left in . good thing ."
19723,elton knows about what makes a good song he has 31 years where he had a song in the billboard top 100 .
19724,wow . he did sell more than 300 million records .
19725,"i wonder if he is richer than the prime minister of australia ? his position is not even in the constitution , his salary must be low ."
19726,"maybe . the prime minister of uk has a cat , and it has the title of chief mouser , funny huh"
19727,"chief mouser ? tupac was mouse king in the nutcracker , i don't think they would go well together ."
19728,"in japan , the prime minister sends a silver cup to celebrate , but so many turned 100 so they had to find a way to make cheaper cups"
19729,"they are ceremonial , they don't need to be sturdy , not like pointes for ballet dancers , they can go through 4 pairs in a week ."
19730,a 1995 radio station actually pranked queen elizabeth . i bet they got in trouble .
19731,do you still listen to radio ? i only listen to streaming service these days .
19732,"not really , just in the car . i would listen if elton john and his song your song came on though"
19733,how yeah ? do you still listen to candle in the wind ?
19734,"sometimes . also , sometimes i play it on the piano . such beautiful music and great tribute to princess diana too ."
19735,good morning ! do you watch dancing on tv ?
19736,good morning ! i used to . haven't watched it recently though . did you know that bruce lee was a great dancer ?
19737,i did ! i think he is a great singer too ! the dance shows have gotten pretty popular . did you know that micheal jackson had a patent on a device that helps him do his extreme leans ? i always wondered how he did it !
19738,wow . i never knew that ! babies will dance when they hear music and smile more when they hit the beat .
19739,it is so fun to see them doing that too . music makes us all happy . tupac danced ballet in high school . can you imagine ? do you like elton john ? i love that he has picked his own name !
19740,yes ! did you know there's a movie coming out about him . i saw the trailer the other day . i think it's called rocket man . he's had more that 50 top 40 hits !
19741,wonderful music ! i did see the trailer for his movie . i so want to see it . it looks wonderful . he has worked with the same lyricist since 1967 !
19742,it does look good . . . . and yes bernie taupin ! they have collaborated on more than 30 albums together !
19743,"isn't that amazing ! the grammys thought ed sheeran wasn't popular enough to perform on them . so elton john decided to sing with him on the show . nice guy ,"
19744,yes ! he has sold more than 300 million records ! that's a lot !
19745,have you heard how elton john and bernia taupin met ?
19746,no i didn't . do you happen to know ?
19747,"i do ! elton john went to an audition and failed . when he told them he couldn't write lyrics , they handed him an envelop of taupin who had failed the same audition !"
19748,that's interesting ! what a story of how they came together . two failed auditions and but together they made history ! for 31 consecutive years elton had at least one song in the billboard hot 100 list !
19749,isn't that amazing ? he's written songs for other bands too ! who knows how many !
19750,"i would be curious to know . i'll have to look that up . his breakout hit ' your song ' was originally recorded by the band three dog night , but they didn't release it as a single as they wanted to let elton have a try with it ."
19751,that's wonderful . i remember watching him sing candle in the wind after diana died . i'm not ashamed to say it made me cry .
19752,i remember that . i think everyone got a teary eyed . the rewritten version of that song for diana sold over 33 million copies alone !
19753,elton john has met kings and the prime minister thru his music . i look forward to watching the movie .
19754,yes . i'm looking forward to seeing it as well . did you know that when you turn 100 in japan the prime minister sends you a silver cup to celebrate ? that's interesting !
19755,oh that's cool ! i had no idea !
19756,"how's it going , are you a big baseball fan ? in canada they call kickball soccerbaseball"
19757,i love baseball . did you know that managers wear uniforms because they could literally play for their team if they wanted ?
19758,i didn't know that was why the wore uniforms but i've heard of managers playing in games before
19759,are you a fan of either the yankees or red sox ?
19760,"yea i'm a yankees fans , it's pretty cool they were known as the highlanders before 1913"
19761,so you must've heard about the two yankees that swapped families ? that's a bit weird .
19762,"i actually haven't , pretty weird to swap families , i wondered if they nicknamed the team"
19763,ha ! yankee players and fans are an interesting bunch . bill o'reilly created a fake press organization in college just so he could get season tickets .
19764,"that's pretty smart , too bad o'reilly's idea wouldn't work nowadays"
19765,how do you feel about the red sox ? did you know that they're partially owned by the new york times ?
19766,"that is quite ironic . it's pretty funny the red sox can't win a game on ben affleck's birthday , guess hes bad luck"
19767,his patriots seem to be doing just fine though . the red sox have still won 9 championships too .
19768,"that's not too bad , i never knew there was another boston team called the red stockings , that city seems obsessed with feet"
19769,"yeah , they changed their name because their manager thought red dye was dangerous ."
19770,"that's pretty odd , did you know the first game at fenway was against the new york highlanders ?"
19771,who ? i remember hearing about them not being able to defend their 1903 championship because the other team didn't want to play
19772,"that is strange , i wonder why the new york giants refused to play the red sox in the world series"
19773,why do you think they did ?
19774,"i have no clue , maybe the ny giants lost to them the previous year on bad calls and were protesting"
19775,maybe they were mad that bobby richardson won a world series mvp even though he lost the series
19776,"well i got to go , nice talking with you"
19777,are you a fan of baseball ?
19778,"i know a little bit about what is going on , but to say i was a fan would be stretching the truth ."
19779,did you know that in 1973 2 yankees pitchers swapped families ?
19780,swapped families ? is that some kind of baseball term i'm not familiar with ?
19781,"no , they switched families ."
19782,that must have made an awkward dressing room . so who's this lost yankees player ?
19783,"yeah , it seems pretty weird . did you know a player got suspended for refusing to get a haircut ?"
19784,"it seems a bit extreme , but i guess i should see his hair before passing judgement . what i find interesting is that the new york times owns part of the boston team ."
19785,"yeah , it was don mattingly , at the time he played first base ."
19786,"i know there is a big rivalry between boston and new york , it would sacrilege for a new york business to have an interest in a boston team ."
19787,the red sox have lost every game on afflecks birthday since goodwill hunting was released .
19788,"i'm aware that affleck is a big boston fan , i wonder how he feels about that . i think , aside from that , his team has done fairly well these past years ."
19789,i'm not sure . did you see the movie goodwill hunting ? i thought it was good .
19790,"my wife likes it , i have not seen it . i hear the owners of the boston team own other sports teams around the world ."
19791,"interesting , it wouldn't surprise me , but i'm not sure that it isn't a conflict of interest ."
19792,i suppose as long as the teams don't compete actively with one another it should be fine .
19793,interesting . did you know a man found 3 million in baseball cards in his grandfathers attic ?
19794,"i should go and visit mine , see if there is anything hidden up there . who would have thought some simple cards could be worth so much ?"
19795,"i used to have a baseball card collection , i should check and see what it is worth ."
19796,"do you have an ozzie albies card , or is he too new of a player ?"
19797,"no , i don't . i only have cards from the 80s . nice chatting with you !"
19798,"hello . it's odd that baseball managers are also part of the team , and can play if they are needed ."
19799,"that is very odd indeed ! i also find it odd that no player has ever attempted to catch a ball with his hat . but if they do , the opposing team receives three free bases so perhaps that's why ."
19800,that's very weird . so is the term ' soccer baseball ' .
19801,ha ! i've never heard that one before ! but i have heard of the alburquerque isotopes minor league team that was named after a team in the simpson's ! ha !
19802,"weirdly , the new york times are partial owners of the boston red sox ."
19803,"is that so ? that's kind of ironic , isn't it ? i do know that lebron is also a member of the group that owns the red sox as well as fc liverpool !"
19804,yeah . lebron is into a lot of things . too bad he has an attitude since moving to la . i wonder where the ' lost ' yankee player is ?
19805,i'm not sure of that one ! but did you know ben affleck forced the gone girl production to shut down for 4 days because he refused to wear a new york yankees cap on screen ? he's a huge red sox fan . that's going overboard and taking it way too far .
19806,"actors and other celebs are so peculiar . bill o'reilly had a fake press organization in college to get season tickets to the yankees , it worked ."
19807,ha ! so true ! i do think it's cool that wrigley and fenway are the only two ballparks that are over 100 years old .
19808,are they ? wow . i guess don mattingly was suspended because he didn't want to cut his hair . how weird .
19809,that is weird . kind of like bobby richardson is the only player to win world series mvp despite actually losing the series .
19810,many japanese are surprised to hear that baseball is popular here .
19811,are they really ? i wonder why ? i also wonder if japan's pro baseball league uses as many balls as the mlb in a single season which is 160k .
19812,"maybe ? i think i would prefer the n . y highlanders , over the ny yankees ."
19813,"speaking of the yankees , did you know their famous logo predates the team ? it was actually designed by tiffany and co . for a medal of valor for a fallen police officer , john mcdowell , way back in 1877 ."
19814,"yes , i did . i have a book on tiffany history . if i were to find a box of baseball cards , i would throw them out , unlike the man who found millions in his grandfather's attic ."
19815,ha ! i need to check my attic then ! i wonder if a card exists on the 17 year old girl who was banned from baseball for striking out both babe ruth and lou gehrig ?
19816,"hopefully , she is a national treasure . weirdly , two yankees pitchers swapped families . permanently ."
19817,"i wonder why ? that's kind of strange ! do you think any cubs fans swapped families the last time they won back to back world series titles , which happened to be the last time they won a series ?"
19818,"i don't know . thank you for chatting with me , have a wonderful day ."
19819,"nice chatting with you ! and before i go , always remember the yankees don't put the player's last names on the back of their jerseys because they feel it puts unneeded attention on the players when the attention should be on the team as a whole . take care , friend !"
19820,hi there ! are you a baseball fan at all ?
19821,hello ! i am ! i don't really have a team but like the red sox ! how about you ?
19822,"oh man , i'm a long time yankee fan . can't stand the red sox !"
19823,the yankees have been fun to watch too ! i'm from the midwest so you don't have to hate me haha . do you know which two ballparks are over 100 years old ?
19824,hmm i'm pretty sure fenway is . i visited it a couple of years ago . i'll admit it's pretty cool . the other one is probably wrigley right ?
19825,did you go to a yankee sox game there ? that would be so cool to see that ! that is correct for both !
19826,i didn't . i just happened to be in boston and decided to stop in since there was a game . did you know the red sox were partly owned by the new york times ?
19827,oh that's cool ! i didn't know that ! lebron james is part of the team that owns the red sox as well !
19828,is he ? that's lame ! ! not a lebron fan over here . isn't he a yankee fan too ?
19829,he's a fan of whatever makes him money lol . i know ben affleck hates the yankees !
19830,who do you think will do better this year ?
19831,i'm thinking the yankees because they have all this young talent who are starting to play well together !
19832,yeah boston has the pitching advantage though . we don't have an answer for chris sale . plus i think boston has better pure hitters .
19833,that's true ! at least they play each other like 15 times so we can see haha . did you see that crazy ball in the hat rule that baseball has ?
19834,ball in the hat ? no i don't think i have .
19835,apparently the opposing team receives three bases if a player catches a baseball in their hat . . . make zero sense lol .
19836,that can't be real . we would have seen it happen . i do know managers can technically play . that's why they wear uniforms .
19837,i wonder if anybody has jumped in ? i can see old tommy lasorda jumping in a dodgers game when he was managing lol .
19838,haha man i think that guy is still around making wine or something .
19839,"i'm sure he is . he has to be 1000 years old now lol . anyways , had a great chat , have an awesome night !"
19840,thanks ! enjoy the rest of the night . got a fantasy baseball draft coming up
19841,"thanks , gotta research for mine !"
19842,"how's it going , do you follow baseball ? the nationals aren't doing too good after losing 30 to the red sox"
19843,"yeah , they just suck big time . and i doubt it's going to improve much . those errors like severino not blocking that pitch in the dirt are very hard to shake ."
19844,yea it was so bad the nationals called a players only meeting but i don't see it helping much
19845,"the manager , martinez , is very typical rah rah kind of guy but that doesn't win games . they need to play better . difo popping out to end the game seems to demonstrate how bad they are ."
19846,erick fedde shoulder shoreness doesn't help either
19847,true . that kind of injury can nag on for the rest of the season . maybe they need a girl pitcher . did you know there was a 1y year old girl got banned back in the day for striking out ruth and gehrig . that's what they need .
19848,"no , that is strange . maybe the manager can play in the game since they technically allowed to play"
19849,"whoops , i meant 17 year old girl . i had heard about managers playing , it would be fun to see that actually happen . i'm kind of surprised actually because my oakland a's have done so many crazy things . that rule is so obscure that everybody knows it . like catching the ball in your hat gives the other team three bases ."
19850,you know i think pete rose played a few games while he was a manager but pete was one crazy dude
19851,you might be right about that . he would never admit to being too old to play . my daughter lives just down the street from fenway park in boston . one of the two 100 year old parks .
19852,"i've been to fenway once , it's pretty crazy their first game was against the ny highlanders"
19853,those highlanders became the yankees in 1913 so that does make 100 years . that club started as the baltimore orioles in 1901 . i bet there were some odd rules back then .
19854,"i'm sure , speaking of odd 2 yankee pitchers swapped families in 1973"
19855,wow ! that's really ' trading places ' . one thing i don't like about the yankees is they don't have names of their uniforms . i guess they are supposed to be so famous that everyone knows them . although the club claims that's to emphasize the team element of the game .
19856,i guess that's a major reason why there is a ' lost ' yankee player
19857,"you mean some kind of ghost ? baseball is full of stories , like how the sox name came from noah webster's plan to simplify spelling . boston and chicago bought in anyway ."
19858,"i figured it was just because people in boston and chicago have horrible accents , especially boston saying sox instead of socks lol"
19859,"yeah , especially boston . can hardly understand some of them . when i play video baseball game with my boy he always wants to be the albuquerque isotopes . that name was actually made up for the simpson's show . i prefer the birmingham biscuits . we have a lot of fun ."
19860,you ever play soccerbaseball aka kickball ?
19861,"no since 3rd grade ! but my grown up hipster daughter and her friends do . i guess it also involves beer . since mlb uses about 160 , 000 balls a year , i guess they need to sell a lot of beer too , to pay for it all ."
19862,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
19863,are you a baseball fan ?
19864,"hello , i love baseball . what about you ?"
19865,"yeah , it's one of my favorite sports ."
19866,did you know the opposing team receives 3 bases if a player catches a baseball in their hat ?
19867,"no , i've never seen that before , but that's probably why ."
19868,there is a baseball team that was named after the baseball team in the simpsons .
19869,"that's funny , i wonder if they're any good . do you collect baseball cards ?"
19870,i love baseball cards . i used to collect them when i was little . do you collect them ?
19871,"yeah , i used to collect them . i heard some guy found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cars in his grandfathers attic ."
19872,"wow that would be an awesome find ! in season of mlb baseball , they can go through 160 , 000 baseballs ."
19873,that's a lot of baseballs . i wonder how many bats they go through ?
19874,i bet not nearly as many bats . they don't seem to break very often .
19875,i heard baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their team . i would love to see that .
19876,i have heard that too . have you ever seen a manager play before ?
19877,"no , i would pay to see one of them step up to the plate ."
19878,i would love to see that too . do you like the yankees ?
19879,"i'm neutral towards them , but i don't hate them like some people ."
19880,i'm about the same . do you like the red sox ?
19881,i feel the same about them as well . how about you ?
19882,pretty much the same . i like the red sox over the yankees .
19883,i heard the new york times owns part of the red sox .
19884,"that's a cool fact to know . well , it was good talking to you . take care ."
19885,do you like baseball ?
19886,yes i do . do you know why the managers wear uniforms ?
19887,yeah because they can play if the team needs them to
19888,yeah . do you know what kickball is called in canada ?
19889,it is called soccerbaseball
19890,yeah . do you know who used to do the mlb schedule for a long time ?
19891,yes a couple and they did it for 24 years straight
19892,"yeah and they scheduled games each year , crazy right ?"
19893,yeah i know . did you hear of that guy that made a fortune from baseball cards ?
19894,yes they were his grandfather's in the attic of the house
19895,yesh he made a total of 3 million by selling them
19896,yeah . in japan is super popular that they cannot believe it is pastime here
19897,yeah . do you like the yankees ?
19898,yes i do . the pitchers in swapped families permanently
19899,did you know there is a lost yankee player
19900,wow cool . bill o'reilly faked a press organization just so he could get free tickets to their games
19901,and the best part about that is that it worked for him
19902,yeah i know . bobby richardson is the only one to win a ws mvp even though he lost the series
19903,cool . do you like the red sox ?
19904,yes i do . they have lost every game on ben affleck's birthday since the goodwill hunting game came out
19905,wow is that a bed omen for them then ?
19906,hello . do you like baseball ?
19907,not really . i would prefer to watch paint dry . what is a washington national and why did they lose to the red sox ?
19908,im not sure . did you know that the yankees have a storied history . in 1973 two yankees pitchers swapped families permanently .
19909,"that does not make sense . i think the wives would notice . washington lost 18 of the past 24 games . cool , a relaxed team ."
19910,i think the wives must have been ok with it if it was permanent .
19911,one of the managers of the washington nationals they would get better . he was right . he would also be right in saying a coin lands on head or tails .
19912,that is tru he was . the yankees actually began play in 1901 as the baltimore orioles .
19913,"so the new york yankees played as the baltimore oreo's . thats pretty strange . was it the bird , or the cookie that came first ."
19914,i would say in history the bird probably came first . lol . the yankees have a lost player . im gonna have to do some research on that . it sounds interesting to say the least .
19915,"yes , research is required for that one . bill o'reilly pulled a neat trick . i wonder if i could do the same today ?"
19916,i dont know . it got him season tickets to the yankees so hey give it a try .
19917,i would like to try . there are so many statistics about baseball . its nauseating . the red sox have lost every game on ben afflecks birthday since they forgot how to spell socks .
19918,did you know that the new york time in part owns the red sox .
19919,"so , that means that a new york newspaper prints articles about a baseball team . truly the end of the world that is . a dying media owning a physical team . if only they owned a virtual team ."
19920,lol . did you know that baseball managers are allowed to play in the game thats why they wear a uniform . pete rose used to do it for the reds .
19921,go pete rose . that guy was a great gambler . i have never been to fenway park . have you ?
19922,i haven't . i know the first game they played in fenway park they 76 beat the new york islanders
19923,"really ? fascinating . the red sox might be worth more money , but the small capacity of fenway park prevents them from getting much attendance . the 12 hot dog and 5 beer dont help either ."
19924,in 1991 the yankes suspended don mattingly for refusing to get a haircut .
19925,don mattingly ? i wonder what the deal was . maybe he wanted long hair . strange rules .
19926,i dont know probably just arguing just to argue . did you know that bobby richardson won the world series mvp but that they lost the series that year .
19927,"did bobby score for the other team ? anyway , have a good day ."
19928,"hello there , are you a big mlb fan ?"
19929,not until recently . been rooting for the brewers until they lost
19930,"that is awesome ! i am a huge brewers fan , have been my whole life and yeah what a season ."
19931,"oh wow , are you from milwaukee , or wisconsin ?"
19932,"yeah i am , i tore my acl playing soccer this summer so got to watch all of the games usually i just catch as many as i can but i work nights ."
19933,the brewers played really well last season . i hated when machado played dirty . so glad the red sox beat the dodgers
19934,"yeah i was not a fan of machado , i really wish we would've won game 7 and i agree , glad the red sox won ."
19935,"do you also play baseball for fun , as well as soccer ?"
19936,"no , i used to when i was a child . how about yourself ?"
19937,"i did too when i was a child . dancing is my sport these days . do you know if the red sox has always won the world series ? , like the patriots in the super bowl ,"
19938,yeah it seems like they have recently right . did you know that managers can technically play in the field ?
19939,"that is an interesting fact . i did not know that . do you mean , pitch or play other positions ? bases ?"
19940,"i think anything , that is why they always wear a uniform as well . not like in other sports where the coach wears a suit and tie !"
19941,wow that is so cool . i never knew that . apparently there is also a ' lost ' yankees player . how does that happen ?
19942,"that is super strange , i never heard that before i might have to google that one ."
19943,"so a man found 3 million dollars worth of 1900 baseball cards , wow . if you were in that situation , would you sell or keep ?"
19944,"nice , i would keep some of them but definitely sell at least a million worth . i could use the money to buy some awesome tickets to real games ."
19945,"that's along the lines of what i would do , sell some and keep some . which brewers player is your favorite ? so far i like yelich ."
19946,"yelich is so awesome , i love his attitude and how humble he is , and that's on top of him being one of the best in the whole league . my favorite was probably kratz this year though lol ."
19947,"i agree ! kratz was great as well . wow being a new baseball fan , it's interesting to learn more things . it was nice chatting with a fellow wisconsinite . what are the chances ?"
19948,"yeah same here , very cool when you responded brewers , first time that has happened to me . hope you enjoy the rest of the day , get ready for the cold !"
19949,"hello there , are you a big baseball fan ?"
19950,"yes i am , i like the yankees what about you ?"
19951,"that's awesome , yeah i am too , but i am a brewers fan , we almost made the world series this year !"
19952,"oh thats too bad ! hopefully next year you can make it , would be nice to see a defining match between the yankees and the brewers ."
19953,yeah that would be a dream of mine to watch the yankees and brewers playing in the world series together .
19954,"would be nice , did you know that a man found baseball cards worth 3 million dollars in his grandfathers attic !"
19955,holy cow ! that would be so crazy to have that happen to you . did you know baseball managers can technically play ?
19956,"i didnt know that ! i guess it never happens , would be interesting to watch though ."
19957,yeah there are a few managers from the past that i would've loved watching swinging a bat .
19958,yeah like who ?
19959,"guys like dusty baker , tony la russa and guys like those !"
19960,"i see ! well i would like to see bobby richardson play again , did youknow he is the only person to win a mvp without winning the series ?"
19961,"no i didn't know that , very interesting . did you know don mattingly got suspended once for not getting a haircut ?"
19962,"thats new , thats a stupid way of suspending a key player lol , most players would get suspended now a days if the same rule applied ."
19963,"yeah i know the simpsons parodied it on probably the best episode that show ever made , it was great ."
19964,"i will sure google that later on , are you a soccer fan ? apparently the red socks are owned by the same company as liverpool f . c ."
19965,"you should , it will be worth it , they had a ton of real baseball players do voices . and yes i am ! liverpool is actually my favorite team . do you watch much ?"
19966,"i will look it up for sure , i think the simpsons are the best and yeah i love soccer , i like man united though and also barcelona ."
19967,"yeah i watch most of manchester's matches , they are doing much better since they let go of mourinho ."
19968,"they sure are , i used to think mourinho was a great coach but theres always fighting in the teams he arrives ."
19969,"yeah he is , and i agree , i think it just got to be too much for the players and it's best for all this way . well it was nice talking with a fellow sports fan , i hope you have a good night ."
19970,hello ! do you follow baseball ? baseball is so popular in japan that many fans are surprised to discover its status as american's national pastime .
19971,"yes , i enjoy going to the games ! ! i'm surprised japan didn't know that ! interesting ."
19972,"baseball has so many interesting facts . for example , did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are able to play for their teams if the need arises ."
19973,"really , i didn't know that was for baseball ? did you know that in a typical season that 160 , 000 baseballs may be used ?"
19974,that is a lot of baseballs . i wonder what they do with all of them . i know a few go to the fans .
19975,"yes , have you ever caught one or came close ? do you know what happens if a baseball player catches the ball in their hat ?"
19976,i have never caught one . what happens ?
19977,pretty exciting i would think ! ! i love to see kids get one . isn't it interesting the ny yankees logo was first designed by tiffany for a police officer !
19978,"speaking of the new york yankees in 1991 , they suspended don mattingly because he refused to get a haircut ."
19979,"really , do you know why or long was his hair ?"
19980,"i am not sure , but i can imagine it was pretty long . on the other hand , the boston red sox are owned in part by the new york times ."
19981,"yes , and i heard lebron james is in part of an owner as well !"
19982,james has to be rich to be able to afford that . he has to be so much richer than the man who found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfather's attic .
19983,"yes , he was part of a group that did . i heard about that ! can you imagine finding cards worth that much in an attic ?"
19984,"a lottery win just above your head , how crazy ! it's as crazy as bill o'reilly inventing a fake press organization in college to get season tickets to the yankees . can you guess if it worked or not ?"
19985,knowing bill o'reilly i bet it did !
19986,yes it worked . he got in . it was smart thinking on his part .
19987,"really , interesting ! did you know there are two major league baseball parks over 100 years old ?"
19988,"considering baseball started to get popular in the early 1900s , i believe it . in 1904 , the red sox won the american league pennant ."
19989,"yes , it did ! its funny ben affleck refused to wear a ny yankees cap on screen in gone girl ! !"
19990,hmm i wonder why . it was nice chatting with you .
19991,"lol , yes , it wouldn't be because he likes the red sox team ! ! good chat !"
19992,have a good day .
19993,"how's it going , do you like baseball ? in canada they call kickball soccerbaseball lol"
19994,"i think baseball is kind of boring , but my significant other likes it ."
19995,"yea it can be pretty boring at times , especially if the manager decides to play in the game"
19996,do you like the yankees or the red sox more ?
19997,"definitely a yankee fan , it's crazy they used to be known as the highlanders , i bet they wouldn't be as popular if they kept that name"
19998,"yeah . the red sox are owned by the same company that owns liverpool fc , and i hate them ."
19999,"the new york times also has a share in them too , it's crazy how people invest in sports now"
20000,at least the yankees are still controlled by the steinbrenner family . rip george steinbrenner .
20001,yea and the yankees got to move into a new ballpark in 2009 too
20002,beats sharing a stadium with the mets .
20003,"yea , i wouldn't want to play in shea stadium with the mets"
20004,they had to share it with the new york jets and the new york giants too .
20005,"sounds very cramp , i guess the yankees and giants left shea stadium so they could go out and win championships"
20006,fenway park has history though . i'll give the red sox that much .
20007,"yea , fenway has been around for over 100 years , very few parks with that much history"
20008,yeah . the red sox have been around since 1901 .
20009,yea and the yankees have been around since 1901 even though they started off as the baltimore orioles
20010,the red sox always lose on ben affleck's birthday and i find that oddly satisfying .
20011,good will hunting must of placed a curse on the red sox
20012,well it was 1997 . what else was ben affleck supposed to do ? chasing amy 2 ?
20013,"i'd watch that . well i have to go , have a nice day"
20014,are you a fan of jazz ?
20015,yeah i enjoy going to jazz clubs from time to time . it is a very historical type of music .
20016,"me too , it has been around since like the 19th century . it is so smooth !"
20017,very smooth . it seems to have originated in west african culture .
20018,"i did not know that . i know that clint eastwood is an avid jazz film , he puts it in his film"
20019,oh that's cool . i am excited to see his new film called meal . jazz players grew goatees as it provided comfort when playing . that makes a lot of sense .
20020,"that is true , i should grow a goatee and then it will be acceptable if i say i am a jazz trumpet person lol"
20021,ha ha yeah that would be funny . one thing i didn't know is that pakistan has a very good jazz orchestra .
20022,i didn't know they knew jazz . are you into watching movies ?
20023,yeah i definitely love movies . i think it's beautiful what some movie makers can do . it is definitely a form of art .
20024,it is such a form of art . i used to love creating movies in school in high school . james wong was the pioneer for wide angle lenses
20025,very cool . he definitely deserved winning his oscar . surprising that he wasn't an american citizen until 1943 .
20026,"for sure , that was so interesting and a crazy time to be asian ! almost like roger deakins being nominated 13 times and never winning"
20027,"yeah i can't believe he never won , it was like leonardo dicaprio . the universe can be a crazy place sometimes . in fact the universe maybe one giant super hologram ."
20028,"for sure , leo ! the universe is so crazy , like it maybe being one giant superhologram"
20029,oh very interesting theory indeed . there is also a theory that there is only one electron in the universe . i don't quite believe that one as much .
20030,"dang , i don't believe that much but i dont have the proof not to believe that lol . i love the universe"
20031,it is a very unique concept . there are stars in the known universe that are cold enough to be touched by the human hand .
20032,"i would love to experience that in my lifetime , but it probably won't happen . touching a star . good chatting with you !"
20033,yeah that would be a really cool thing to accomplish . there's even a region of space that may be pulling galaxies outside the observable universe . great chatting with you too see you later .
20034,"i am going to look up more facts from the universe , so nice ! have a good day !"
20035,hi there ! did you know that there are stars that are cold enough for a human to be able to touch ?
20036,yeah i actually knew that the sun will eventually cool down . the universe is an amazing topic great start i must say !
20037,"thanks ! the universe is really fascinating , and there's so much to learn ! i love reading about the different theories like the one that believes the universe evolved through natural selection ."
20038,"yeah there are a lot of good theories as well , also the one that the universe exists in a black hole ."
20039,i haven't heard that one . . . actually that one makes sense to me . although does the black hole exist in another universe ? did you hear the theory that the universe is actually one giant superhologram ?
20040,"i have no idea , i think the theory is really complex and i did hear about that one i think its best to keep an open mind but i don't believe that theory is true ."
20041,i absolutely agree . are you a fan of jazz ?
20042,"i am a fan of the genre yeah , it has deep roots that go to african communities of new orleans ."
20043,"yes , it's thought of as america's classical music . i recently learned that jazz trumpeters grew goatees for comfort while playing , not for the look !"
20044,"ive always wondered about those goatees , they look really funny , i guess they serve a purpose and it all makes sense now ."
20045,"yes , i always thought they were funny . when i think of a jazz player i think of the muppets , lol ."
20046,why is that lol ? did you ever watch the series breaking bad ?
20047,"i saw the first few episodes , why ?"
20048,there is a jazz musician that is called walter white and he has a new album called ''breaking good''
20049,"oh my goodness , that's funny ! ! ! there is a woman in harlem who holds a free jazz concert at her apartment every sunday , sometime top performers stop by !"
20050,that must have been great also annoying if you dont like jazz . i bet her neighbors appreciated that though .
20051,"i didn't even think about that ! well , she's been doing in for the past twenty years , i guess her neighbors would have moved if they didn't like it !"
20052,"ella fitzgerald was another jazz player she thought herself to sing 2 notes at once , seems like she had a talent for music"
20053,"wow , two notes at once ? i never noticed , i wonder how many singers can do that ? very impressive ! i guess clint eastwood is a fan of jazz he included it and even scored several of his films with it !"
20054,"maybe clint eastwood did that as well , his one of my favorite actors but anyways its lunch time it was great chatting with you friend ."
20055,"it was great chatting with you , have a great day and enjoy your lunch !"
20056,good morning ! are you into music ?
20057,i am into music are you ?
20058,yes i am ! i do like rap music . never heard of the korean rap battles though .
20059,"compliment battles , they seem kind of lame to me lol"
20060,very lame but to each their own haha . i didn't think eminem wanted to ever be anything else but a rapper !
20061,"apparently one of his passion is comic books , he wanted to be a comic book artist"
20062,i'm glad he stopped that route and became a rapper ! i wonder if he went to high school with any famous people like jay z did ?
20063,"no idea about that , he might , do you like jay z ?"
20064,i like some of his songs . i didn't know he ghostwrote a song for space jam ! i'll have to look into that one .
20065,"didnt know about that one either , are you aware of his album american gangster ?"
20066,"i am , i think he pulled it off itunes though for some reason ?"
20067,"he did , because he thought his collection shouldnt be sold as individual singles , i guess he really appreciated his own work"
20068,i think he has a good point there ! do you wear hats by the way ? did you know more people wore bowler hats and not cowboy hats in the old west ?
20069,"i guess movies have tricked us all ! didnt know about that , interesting fact though"
20070,"i don't even know what a bowler hat is , is that bad ? i wonder if they could tip hats back in the day too ."
20071,"that is a good question , google will solve it after we finish chatting , do you know the origins of the conical party hats ?"
20072,weren't they derived from dunce caps ?
20073,"yeah , they were , they were worn to enforce and encourage foolish behavior , i dont see them at parties anymore ."
20074,i think i need some of those in my office right now . a lot of people around here lol .
20075,"that can definitely cheer a lot of them up lol , i can relate"
20076,"i'm going to see what i can do to cheer people up haha . it was awesome chatting , have a great day !"
20077,"hello there , are you a fan of jayz ?"
20078,"not really , but i do like the song ' empire state of mind ' that he did with alicia keys . the song ' california gurls ' was written as an answer song to that"
20079,yeah didn't snoop dogg rap on that song california gurls ?
20080,"yes , he recorded it with katy perry . there's also a song on the space jam soundtrack that's sung by bugs bunny that jayz was a ghostwriter for"
20081,"that is pretty interesting , i didn't know he was writing music that far back ."
20082,many artists started off in song writing . his first album was released in 1996 . now he has thirteen
20083,i think he is up there for most ever grammys or grammy nominations as well .
20084,he's been rapping since high school though because he had a rap battle with busta rhymes in the lunchroom since they attended the same school
20085,"that must have been an awesome battle , would be cool if you were there and could tell the story today ."
20086,"well , dmx also went to that school and also might have been there to see it . one of jayz's albums was pulled from itunes because he didn't want people buying individual songs and missing the big picture they would get from the album as a whole"
20087,"that is a pretty cool concept , i don't think artists appreciate the whole album experience like the used to , not all but a lot ."
20088,albums that are done well should be a seamless experience between songs . have you heard of the dc comics miniseries called ' kingdom come ' ?
20089,"agreed , and no i haven't heard about it , what is it about ?"
20090,it's about a retired superman in the future coming out of retirement and showing the younger superheroes how saving the world is done . it inspired jayz's album with the same name
20091,that sounds pretty cool i will have to check that out when i get some time .
20092,"he's not the only rapper who likes superheroes . eminem's favorite superhero is spiderman , and he originally wanted to be a comic book artist"
20093,"yeah i think i read that , interesting to think what eminem's comic book art would have looked like ."
20094,it's not too late for him to try . there's a type of freestyle invented by korean rappers called a ' compliment battle . ' how nice of them !
20095,"that sounds pretty cool , did you hear about the judge in an eminem suit ?"
20096,didn't the judge give her ruling by rapping ?
20097,"yeah she rapped it out to him , that sounds too funny to be true ."
20098,"i mean , i would do that too if i could . apparently i need to go back and watch the rugrats movie because busta rhymes did the voice of the reptar wagon"
20099,hi how are you ? do you like rap music ?
20100,i like some stuff . mainly some of the older stuff . i do enjoy jayz
20101,i dont really know his stuff . he is quite popular ive heard .
20102,"i know he is in the songwriter's hall of fame , i am not too familiar with his entire body of work , but what i have heard , i like ."
20103,i guess he has rivals in the rap world ? is kanye one of them ?
20104,"i think so , but i also think they worked on an album together . i dont personally care for kanye ."
20105,"i dont really like him as a person and i dont know his music . to me , he seems to focus too much on himself ."
20106,"i agree with that , and i don't agree with his thinking , either . he had a controversial comment about aids . . ."
20107,i'm not convinced that he knows much about science and medicine . hm .
20108,enough about him . . . did you know jayz was the ghostwriter for the song bugs bunny sang on space jam ?
20109,i did not know that . jayz probably writes a lot of songs that get used in different situations .
20110,"he is a prominent rapper , so he likely has songs i dont even realize are his !"
20111,true . did you know that tupac shakur's music is in the library of congress of ' cultural significance ' ?
20112,"no . that is pretty cool . i never got into him , but i hear his music was pretty good ."
20113,i dont know his stuff either . i know that he was a dancer as well . he was a gifted guy .
20114,"he really was , i read he also studied jazz , poetry and other stuff while in school ."
20115,i am not surprised . did you know that korean rappers engage in something called a compliment battle ?
20116,"yeah , it is something that they also call their freestyle . here it is an insult battle . lol"
20117,"yes , i think the koreans are doing something culturally appropriate . anyway , great chat !"
20118,same to you ! have a great day !
20119,"thanks , you too ! bye"
20120,bye !
20121,do you like jay z ?
20122,i do . do you know his full name ?
20123,his name is shawn corey carter
20124,yeah . did you know he went to high school with busta rhymes ?
20125,yea and notorioug big and used to have lunchroom rap battles
20126,that must have been so cool to hear back then
20127,right ? he pulled his american gangster album from itunes
20128,yes as he said albums should not be sold piece by piece
20129,yes and compared it to movies not being sold frame by frame
20130,yeah . do you know where the name of the album kingdom come came from ?
20131,yes the dc comics with the same name about the retired superman
20132,yes and in it he comes back to show the new guys how it is done
20133,yes the irony in that name alone is so extreme
20134,i know . do you like hats ?
20135,i sure do . do you know the most popular one in the old west ?
20136,yes contrary to popular belief it was the bowler hat
20137,yeah . do you know where the tipping of the hat originated ?
20138,yes when knights removed their visors to show friendliness
20139,yeah . the conical party hat originated from the dunce caps
20140,so silly . nice chat today
20141,same here
20142,hey there do you like sharks ? i know that i hate the shark in jaws lol
20143,ha ! that was a bad shark !
20144,yep he was evil ! it's funny that sharks are older than both dinosaurs and trees too
20145,wow . and still they have no rib cages .
20146,wow that's crazy ! it's also crazy that you could have a pet shark and you could train it to bark lol i don't like the sound of that
20147,"wow , i didnt know sharks barked . i didnt think they made a sound"
20148,no that would be really scary sound to hear if sharks were barking lol what do you think about sharks rescuing sailors apparently dolphins and sharks do that
20149,"that is neat , maybe they are not all bad . except that shark cafe . . . that sounds like something from nightmares ."
20150,yep that sounds horrifying haha . i would definitely not want to run into a caf of great white sharks lol
20151,its like they are just waiting for their snack to come to them
20152,yes we need to have a scientist come by to study these shark cafes lol did you know that the emperor of japan is actually a scientist
20153,really ? why does it seem that every other country has a really smart person in power except us .
20154,yeah i don't know the world isn't fair i guess haha . what do you think about the fact that only one scientist has ever walked on the moon ?
20155,i am kind of surprised more of the first astronauts werent some sort of scientist .
20156,"yes i agree , but scientists are really smart did you hear about the scientist who , when he was 6 , could divide 2x 8 digit numbers in his head ?"
20157,"yeah , he could converse in ancient greek too ! that is amazing . i cant even do those things now ."
20158,"nope i can't either ! it's truly remarkable , what about comedies though , are you at least interested in those ? i know that i love bill murray"
20159,i love comedy . bill murray was great in ghostbusters .
20160,"yep he also recommends that you watch the movie kung fu hustle , he calls it a supreme achievement , have you ever seen it"
20161,"nope , so i cant fully agree or disagree with him"
20162,"i think the movies ok , one movie i didn't like was green lantern with ryan reynolds , they should have made it a comedy with jack black , that sounds much better"
20163,have you watched skyscraper ? it was a good movie ! full of action
20164,for me skyscraper was decent . at least it was better than the meg
20165,the meg had the world's biggest shark . i rather watch jaws .
20166,"while the meg was like jaws , but bigger wasn't better as the film was blandly satisfying and equally forgetful"
20167,that movie got 2 stars . what a shame .
20168,"jaws was a good movie that unfortunately made people very very afraid of sharks . did you know even sharks have rescued sailors ? in any case the meg is a hollywood rehash of things that work , but are terrible"
20169,"that is true . there has been some news about people getting killed by sharks , swimming in the open . there are other sharks that are safe , but make sure to be with trained swimmers . it gives a different perspective of how sharks are through meg ."
20170,"even then , the meg takes its sweet time to start going , barely delivering the trills and chills expected of such a film . its series of close calls become growing comedic rather than believable or action packed ."
20171,"well , it does seem comedic due to the enormous shark . they should change the genre to comedy instead of action ."
20172,"at that point it is funny just because of how bad it is . . . as an actor statham does well , but can't carry the film like his rival johnson ."
20173,"interesting , did you know that jack black starred in most of the comedy films such as green lantern ?"
20174,"i thought jack black was originally going to star in green lantern , which was going to be a comedy , but he ended up not being in green lantern ?"
20175,"wow , that is sad . jack black should have been chosen ."
20176,"the chance of it being a better film as a comedy is very high . personally , i tend to be bias towards comedy since its purpose is to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter"
20177,true . have you watched comedy central ?
20178,not really . i only recently read that they cancelled over 100 shows since it was created in 1989
20179,you can watch it on youtube . they should have them still .
20180,what is comedy central offer in terms of content ?
20181,"well , they have improvisation . i personally thought it was funny ."
20182,are they like monty python ? they also do a lot of improv like the parrot sketch
20183,"yes , it is similar . it was nice chatting with you ."
20184,hi have you seen the meg movie ?
20185,"i saw in the theater ! i thought it was pretty interesting , although it got mediocre ratings ."
20186,it looks pretty good . is it like jaws ? i haven't seen it yet .
20187,it was a like a fancy new age jaws but with jason statham and ruby rose .
20188,nice . i'm going to have to check it out . did you know that sharks can be trained like dogs to bark ? odd . . .
20189,a barking shark ? ! that is odd from a cartilaginous fish !
20190,i know . . . . and how in the heck did they ever to decide ' hey . . . let's see if we can make a shark bark ! ' lol
20191,maybe it began with pet sharks . indonesia has a community with shark pets .
20192,that sounds different . lol i would like to see some videos of the white shark cafe in the middle of the pacific ocean . it's where great white sharks congregate .
20193,sharks are ticklish . i wonder if they laugh along with bark ?
20194,how do they know that ? lol sharks evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees . maybe that has something to do with it .
20195,i would like to see some research done by scientists on this issue . scientists gain knowledge based on their research .
20196,"yep . they must have done some research on how not only dolphins , but sharks can rescue sailors too . i wouldn't have wanted to be the guinea pig in that research project . lol"
20197,people have to be scientists or magicians to own a rabbit in queensland . what a silly law .
20198,i've never heard that . i wonder why ? . . a magician too ? lol
20199,i find it humorous comedy that magicians are the only other exception to the rabbit ownership rule .
20200,yes . odd for sure . the world wide web was invented by an english scientist in 1989 . they really developed it fast because i remember being able to go online around 1995
20201,the good old days of dial up connections . major expense went into developing it . i wonder how it compares to the 200 million budget for evan almighty .
20202,i loved that movie . do you like comedies ?
20203,i do ! i wish they were up for oscars because they are deserving and it has been 37 years since one won .
20204,i love them too . i didn't realize that comedy central was created in 1989 . same year as the world wide web !
20205,that was a big year for important things ! nice meeting you !
20206,"kanye west was really seriously a happy man while playing family fued , wasn't he ."
20207,"haha i think so , he was very spirited with his shouting and ' dragon energy ' haha"
20208,"yah , dragon energy he said he shared with trump of all people ."
20209,"ya pretty crazy , also he was born in 1977 and has sold about 120 million records so he's no slouch"
20210,yes he is a very popular rapper .
20211,"oh ya for sure , but hes kind of crazy he thinks aids was man made"
20212,hahaha ! true . he has some real funny ideas .
20213,"yup very werid , he is nice though once he gave his mic to a wheelchair bound fan"
20214,"yes , he did . he also sings some gospel songs ! that was shocking to me . he has a wide range of changes in his approach to sweep people off their feet ."
20215,"oh definitely , and he has a history of off color interruptions , like at that award ceremony with taylor swift"
20216,he's supposed to be the only one out of the top 10 most successful songs of all time that is in a minor key !
20217,"that is impressive , do you like kim kardashian at all ?"
20218,"yes , i do . she hit tv like no tomorrow and got extremely high pay , especially in 2015 when she took the highest paid reality television personality !"
20219,"ya she hit the ground running , weird that she used to be the personal assistant for paris hilton !"
20220,"everyone has to start somewhere . ya think ? that 2003 sex tape with her former boyfriend , ray j that got leaked in 2007 helped push her to the forefront ."
20221,"oh definitely , and now shes married to kanye west and in fallout boy music videos !"
20222,"who would have ever thought kanye west ? hahahaha ! yah , she jumped right in there in 2014 and they got thee kids right off the bat !"
20223,"lol ya she did , and her father got famous from being part of oj's defense team , i remember that"
20224,true ! she hit the top 100 most influential people in 2015 and was plastered all over time magazine !
20225,"yup she was , do you like rap music ? i guess tupac's music was given to the library of congress because it was deemed ' culturally significant '"
20226,"personally , there is very little rap that i like . tupac is a big name in the industry along with eminem ."
20227,"ya , i was just shocked they rap in korea and do ' compliment battles ' sounds crazy"
20228,"hello , do you like sharks ?"
20229,i think they are pretty neat ! i dont want to swim with them though .
20230,they are amazing animals . sharks have no rib cages which means on the land they can crush their own body .
20231,i think it is cool that they rescue sailors . so they are not the monster jaws makes the out to be .
20232,i think so too . sharks evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees .
20233,wow ! that is amazing . i would have expected the other two to be first .
20234,me too . great white sharks congregate in the middle of the pacific in an area know as the white shark cafe .
20235,also known as the place you wont find me .
20236,haha right ! sharks can be trained like dogs to bark .
20237,that would be the scariest sound to hear right before it eats you . . . lol
20238,i agree lol . do you like science ?
20239,i do . i find it fascinating . im no scientist though .
20240,i do too . one of the emperors of japan is a scientist and still publishes papers to this day .
20241,wow . to bad we cant elect someone with that intellect .
20242,i agree . harrison schmitt is the only scientist to walk on the moon .
20243,you would have thought more of the astronauts would have been scientists .
20244,i would think so too . harvard scientists stored a gif animation of a galloping horse in the dna of bacteria .
20245,even beginning to understand how that is done baffles me .
20246,i agree . it doesn't even make sense to me . do you like comedy ?
20247,i do ! it has to be my favorite genre !
20248,i think it's great . nothing better than a good laugh !
20249,the green lantern was supposed to be a comedy in the beginning .
20250,good talking to you
20251,"hi , how are you ? seeing a study saying 'zapping' the brain decreases aggressive intentions ."
20252,i have read that brain stimulation help prevent future violence .
20253,i wonder how long it lasts ?
20254,according to an article i read it depends on the experiment
20255,interesting . are you a fiction reader at all ?
20256,i do . did you know what in 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it has a black character
20257,i wish i were surprised . i also see taht george rr martin of game of thrones hates fan fiction .
20258,wow . i didn't know that . talking about something else did you know that windows 95 was the second most installled piece of software on computers . windows has been for a long time
20259,on a huge percet of computers . apparently smoking near apple computers voids the warranty for a biohazard .
20260,i wonder how can smoking affect it . it also amazing the fact that the first windows computer at standfor was constructed from lego bricks .
20261,i really dont know . some people want to be able to upload their minds to memory sticks . strange thought .
20262,i know . but in those days there are better devices to use . i read something funny the other day about that it is a illigal to own a rabbit in queensland . can you believe that ?
20263,i wonder why ?
20264,don't know . but will find out later . another interesting fact is that matt patricia is the only rocket scientist coaching in the nfl .
20265,"he's a smart guy , good luck to him with the lions ."
20266,do you know if it is true that before coaching he was a working aeronautical enginner ?
20267,"i don't know on that , more impressive he has a potential career outside football !"
20268,sure . i read he was graduated from rpi
20269,what is rpi ?
20270,"i think it is a school whose fight song includes sin , cosine and tangent and some other things i can't remember"
20271,thats funny ! i want hear the song . have a great day !
20272,hi there . i like watching reality tv as a guilty pleasure and kim and kenya are at top of my list . how about you ?
20273,"i don't watch reality tv , but i heard the family feud episode they're on is worth watching !"
20274,"yeah , me too . i watched it and it was a hoot . i have never seen kenya smile and be a happy person . the host steve harvey is so funny and great that it would be hard not to smile around him ."
20275,i'll have to look it up ! it would be weird seeing kanye as a likeable person ! what is it about the reality tv shows with them do you like ?
20276,i think it is just the shock value . the glimpse on family feud into another aspect of them all was interesting too because they were in a fun environment . kanye has released some good music and some dark cracked psyche kind of music too they are like watching a train wreck .
20277,"how weird , i'm sure if i had cable i would get hooked into it ! i heard kim kardashian used to be a personal assistant to paris hilton ."
20278,"oh wow , thats crazy , really ? i wonder if she traveled and everything with paris ?"
20279,"yes , she traveled as her stylist ! i wonder how paris hilton feels about her former stylist outfaming her ? !"
20280,"probably sour and mad , lol . i know that vogue magazine said that kim was a trail blazer and a pop culture phenomenon ."
20281,"is that right ? i've heard that she's a trailblazer of the ' selfie movement ' , not an honor i would be proud of ! do you know any other interesting facts about her ?"
20282,well yes i do . she was reported to be the highest paid reality star of 2015 and earned more than 53 million dollars . she also was in a music video early on in her career for the fall out boys .
20283,"my goodness ! all that money for putting your life onto the tv , how crazy ! ! ! i wonder if that music video is very good , i do like the fall out boys . do you think she would have become famous if it weren't for her dad being on the defense team for oj simpson ?"
20284,"i think her dad helped the cause for sure but you make a good point , i don't know . she has done some good things with her money and fame also ."
20285,"that's true , she advocates to raise awareness for the armenian genocide . it's nice when people put themselves to a cause ."
20286,"yes , exactly . i was raised in an area where that was an important cause overlooked by many . he dad was armenian ."
20287,"are you armenian ? that's horrible about the genocide , i don't think i would have heard of it if it wasn't for her efforts ."
20288,"i am not but was raised in a town that many migrated to and it was a known subject to me my whole life . kim was also interesting in her pick for a husband , that is another reason i follow her crazy decisions . kanye omari west was born in 1977 and he has one of the top 10 most successful songs of all time , gold digger . i hate to say i like the song ."
20289,"and it was the only song he wrote in a minor key ! you would think , given it's success , that he would write more songs in that key . . . what if that's the secret to it's success ? ?"
20290,"i think you are on to something , hmmm . i am gonna read kim's book ' selfish ' and contemplate . thank you for the fun chat , have a good one !"
20291,it was a fun chat ! have a great day !
20292,"you too , i liked the crazy topics we explored , see ya ."
20293,computers are so fascinating and we've come so far with them .
20294,yeah . i can't imagine my commedore 64 today . . .
20295,"no , we had no graphics or storage back then . now they are used for everything . even factories have industrial robots ."
20296,have you ever seen the boston dynamics robots that can run and jump on boxes ?
20297,i have not . that is intriguing and i will have to look that up . can you believe that the space shuttle's general purpose computer runs on only 1mb of ram ? !
20298,"if i am an astronaut , i am little worried about going into space with a computer with 1mb of ram . . . what are they hiding ? ? ? ?"
20299,i am a little worried also just because i would think they would need more for such complicated processes in order to be safe . i did not know that computers even existed in 1936 but in that year russians made a computer that ran on water .
20300,"wow , that's crazy ! they are not the ones i associate with the invention of the computer ."
20301,i'm not that versed on computer history unfortunately . at this point we are so far past what we were . someone built a 16bit computer using nothing but basic minecraft building blocks and it works .
20302,i would be interested in know if zapping the brain also worked on cte or overly aggressive football players doing bad off the field .
20303,that's a good question . biology is a fascinating subject . are you interested in science ?
20304,i am . i studied it the first 3 years of college and then organic chemistry suggested i move on from that .
20305,i took every biology course i could in high school and a few in college and i wasn't even a science major i just enjoy it . scientists at harvard stored a gif of a galloping horse in the dna of bacteria . i don't understand how that's even possible ? !
20306,have you heard about crispr ? i listened to a podcast about it and the science was completely over my head . i got out at the right time . . .
20307,i have not but i will look into it because i'm always curious to know more . did you know that only one scientist has walked on the moon ? i find that surprising .
20308,"yeah , that is strange . i thought there would be more . maybe they are at mission control or they are more engineers ? would you ever want to go into space ?"
20309,no way . i think it's fascinating but i'll stick to the safety of seeing it in pictures ha ha . how about yourself ?
20310,"nope ! i remember watching 2 shuttles explode and i don't want that to happen . plus i would miss my wife and kids too much ! i find the people going to spacex , an unproven spacecraft , crazy !"
20311,the challenger was horrible . i don't know what the spacex people are thinking . i was unaware that the emperor of japan is a scientist who still publishes papers .
20312,"wow , that's interesting . i think kim jong un has a degree in pysics but who's going to fail him so i gquestion it's legitimacy . . ."
20313,"he makes a lot of crazy statements so i highly doubt it but you're right , his people can't question it ."
20314,nice chatting with you !
20315,you as well .
20316,good evening . just signing on to my computer ; not sure i could live without it .
20317,why do you say that . if you don't mind me asking ?
20318,"i just use it so much i guess . did you know that way back in the 1930s , russians created a waterrun computer ?"
20319,really ? no i haven't heard of that before . so they use water to power up a computer ? i wonder what was the point in that .
20320,"who knows . i'm all for utilizing other things , but i just can't believe it worked very well ."
20321,lol i bet . . . . so are you into comics ?
20322,"i used to be . for about three years when i was younger and then tried again as an adult , but it was an expensive hobby . i love fiction though . you ?"
20323,i'm kinda in the same boat as you . i just read that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic becasue it featured a black character . smh
20324,we have come along way since then . i know george rr martin would like to ban all fan fiction !
20325,"really , why do you say that ?"
20326,on the one hand he sees it undermining copyright laws and on the other he sees it as potentially hurting someone pursuing writing .
20327,he has a point i guess . . . but i like reading fan fiction .
20328,"i wonder if you've ever come across fan fiction written by julius caesar . it seems crazy to believe , but i guess when he was young he wrote about hercules and oedipus !"
20329,yeah i read an article about that . i wonder who would win in a fight it came down to hulk vs hercules ?
20330,"in the marvel universe i think it's hulk no problem , but i don't know how close to the myth marvel went with their version of the character ."
20331,did you know that there's a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilitles . i wonder if hercules on there then i could rank him against the hulk .
20332,we just need to get on our computers or at least get our top scientists to look into the issue .
20333,haha . . . i know right . get some egg heads on it lol . do you know any scientists ?
20334,the emperor of japan is also a scientist and is still publishing papers . do you know any ?
20335,nope can't say that i do . . . but it was nice talking to you tho .
20336,you too !
20337,"hello , have you heard of the possibility of stimulating the brain with zaps to decrease aggressive instincts ?"
20338,"that is quite amazing , like something from science fiction . i just wonder if it will really translate to real life . it seems the test was to zap the prefrontal cortex and then have participants rate how they respond after reading a story with aggression . i know you cannot test in real life , i'm just not sure how realistic the reading exercise is ."
20339,"it definitely feels like science fiction ! it's crazy how rapidly scientists are innovating , i believe the term scientist wasn't even a regular thing until the 19th century , and look where we are now !"
20340,"in some ways i agree , like creating this computerized device to electrically stimulate the brain . its a bit scary that external devices can manipulate the brain's wiring ."
20341,"absolutely , at the same time i think it's important to remember this is nothing definite yet . the researcher , olivia choy , still maintains this is just an early step ."
20342,"i agree . but tom hummer at indiana university school of medicine points out that the biggest limitation of the study is the difficulty of measuring actual aggression in the lab . so , while it initially may show promise , the next step is to develop better experimental methods to more accurately measure the effects ."
20343,with better methods though i have a lot of hope for the future . amazing things come out of science . even the world wide web was invented by an english scientist .
20344,"at the same time , scientist can be an eccentric bunch . do you know that there is a ' steve ' project regarding evolution in which a signatory must be named steve or some variation thereof ?"
20345,"i didn't know that no ! that seems very interesting and confusing , i wonder who came up with it ."
20346,i'm not sure . at the same time they can be quite inventive in the most unusual ways . did you know that the first google computer was housed in an enclosure made from lego bricks . that's a long way from the google of today !
20347,wow it's crazy how people can make something from nothing . i saw once that someone used basic minecraft building blocks to create a working 16bit computer !
20348,"and i thought 16bit computers went out of production in the 1980s ! computers have really advanced science in ways that were not possible earlier , great advances in space travel were made possible with computer simulations . and computers are getting smaller . harvard scientist have been able to store an animation of a galloping horse in the dna of bacteria ! ! !"
20349,"computers are getting smarter and yet i feel that there is so much more room to innovate ! for example smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty , that scares me and makes me feel like it actually could harm the computer's system !"
20350,"i'm not quite sure how apple will enforce that warranty use a swab test for tobbacco combustion residue ? with scientist and computers , the line between the present and the future is somewhat blurred . did you know scifi author isaac asimov created the term ' robotics ' in 1941 ?"
20351,"i didn't know that ! that must have been before robotics was even thought of very often , whereas now it's a huge debate ! although i think the history may go back even further , like i believe edgar allen poe wrote the first known example of robots in fiction ."
20352,"could be ; i have not read poe in ages . in weird science news , did you know its illegal to own a rabbit in queensland australia unless you have a magician's license or are a scientist ? that sounds like it could be straight out of fiction ! ! !"
20353,"oh absolutely , and i have no clue how they would follow that ! other strange science news i heard about was a very young prodigy , john von neumann could divide 8 digit numbers and converse in ancient greek all by the age of 6 ."
20354,that was truly remarkable age 6 ! . do you know when i completed college ?
20355,"no clue ! i'm guessing it was very early on though , maybe he grew up to be one of those genuises that helped build a computer that runs on water !"
20356,"sorry about the slip of the fingers , it should have been ' he ' and not ' i ' . i guess some of the more eccentric people can be the most creative and with the right guidance produce something than has real world applicability . well right now , i am thinking about going program my microwave to make popcorn !"
20357,"no worries ! maybe you'll be the next great mind in science , who knows ! it was nice chatting with you , have a great night !"
20358,same to you . and don't self experiment with the electrodes to the brain !
20359,"ahah definitely a good idea , thank you for the advice . good night !"
20360,would you be someone that reads much poetry ?
20361,"lol not since high school but i know a little about it , like the epic of gilgamesh written in sumerian"
20362,that's more than me . i like to read but i don't enjoy poetry . nicole cooley is a complete unknown to me .
20363,"lol yea back in high school we had to read stuff like the odyssey and illiad , personally i thought the stories were interesting but way too long"
20364,"yes , school was probably my last real interaction with poetry , i recall having to memorize a poem by wordsworth , and having to recite it to the class ."
20365,that's sucks . some classes i took would make you write poems which i sucked at . i can't imagine ever writing a 274 line poem with 800 irregularly pronounced words like one poet did
20366,"i remember being very nervous about the recitation , i got very hot under the collar . we had to wear shirt and ties to school , i distinctly remember the feeling ."
20367,"too bad you weren't a viking , they though poetry was a gift from odin . they probably wouldn't make you dress up for poetry recitation"
20368,"the vikings were a bit more casual in their dress . i don't think they were too bothered about having the right label on their clothing , no lacoste symbols on their chainmail ."
20369,yea and they didn't have to wear blue shirts at funerals like the pallbearers at billy may's funeral
20370,"i think maybe i'll write a poem about how i hate reciting poetry , especially in a shirt and tie ."
20371,if it's really bad maybe cs lewis will read it at a laugh you lose competitions he has
20372,to be honest i think i would find bad poetry more entertaining than good poetry .
20373,"yea , maybe that should of been an olympic event instead of regular poetry"
20374,"now you mention i do recall the were gold medal for poetry in the early days , i think for art as well . i just read today that they want break dancing to be in the upcoming olympics ."
20375,"break dancing as an olympic event sounds pretty subjective but so was poetry , art , and music"
20376,"i suppose it would be like the ice dancing , a bunch of judges making a evaluation . essentially an election ."
20377,yea but apparently the faster blinker has lost every us presidential election since 1980 so maybe there is an objective way to judge candidates
20378,i can just see all the upcoming candidates getting blinking coaching to ensure they optimism their blinking for the american public . it seems height plays a roll in elections too .
20379,must be why hank the cat didn't win in the virginia senate election and only place third
20380,that or there was too much blinking . do cats blink ? i'd like to see how a cat does in office . many would say better than we normally get .
20381,can't be worse . well it was nice talking with you
20382,are you familiar with association football ? perhaps you know it better as soccer ?
20383,i used to play soccer ! yes . i usually watch the world cup ! what about you ?
20384,i too enjoy watching the fifa world cup every four years
20385,i'm not surprised that soccer generates more income than other major sports combined . the world loves soccer !
20386,"personally i was a bit surprised by that fact . i knew soccer was popular , but it didn't seem as popular as other sports like football in america"
20387,"soccer will never be popular in the us . maybe they need to bulid a special city , like in qatar . the city set to host the 2022 qatar world cup final does not yet exist"
20388,"despite its popularity , the us mens team still haven't placed below third place in the world cup"
20389,"the women's team ? yeah , they're good . same with japan . much better than the men . don't know why so many countries vie for the wc . there are no net economic gains for them ."
20390,i wouldn't say no economic gains . their is prestige and bragging rights . i also think there are ways people make money off the world cup .
20391,"i think rich countries can take the hit , but brazil ? they had a stadium in the middle of nowhere . poor countries should put money into infrastructure . it's great that german soccer player mesut ozil donated his victory bonus to pay for surgeries for 23 children in brazil ."
20392,"despite making investments in stadiums , wouldn't brazil make it up with prestige , tourism , and other related sources of revenue ? i understand you point , but i just am not familiar enough to say ."
20393,"i don't know . there is an underclass in brazil that needs attention , and i think they love watching soccer , but i don't know if the wealth every reaches them ."
20394,"i see your point . on another not , did you know there a variation of soccer with 3 teams instead of 2 in a free for all ? that sounds amazing"
20395,how many referees do they need ? and are there 11 players on each team ? sounds like confusion .
20396,"i would still like to see it at least once . sound chaotic , but in a good way"
20397,i wouldn't place a bet on a team until i knew more about it . do you listen to the beatles ?
20398,"they have some amazing songs , despite not being about to read music"
20399,"i do not know how , but the beatles have the best selling album of the 2000's . i thought the kids would be listening to something else ."
20400,i think that the beatles still is a timeless classic . they even had an enormous following resulting in beatlemania
20401,i think they were smart to stop touring . the amplification technology couldn't keep up with the screaming . plus touring is really hard on you . away from home for months . seems tough .
20402,"i agree . in any case , it was wonderful chatting with you about the beatles"
20403,yes ! i enjoyed the chat ! have a good evening !
20404,the same to you .
20405,hey there do you like poetry at all ?
20406,i like poetry . i once saw that feminst poet who did a riff on that lou reed song . someone told me to read alice james
20407,"yeah i've heard that's pretty good . i'll have to check it out . i also want to check out the poem that , when red normally is depressing , but when read backwards is actually a very inspiring thing to read"
20408,"thats a neat trick . obviously it wont say ' paul is dead ' . speaking of tricks , i would like to check out trickster feminism ."
20409,it does sound interesting . can you believe that edgar allan poe only got like 10 for writing his famous poem the raven . that is a travesty
20410,yeah . mark zuckerberg grey tshirts cost 300400 bucks .
20411,that's very strange . he's definitely over paying haha . . i would love to live in hawaii where the famous official business suit is the aloha shirt
20412,"yeah , in contrast the brits only considered collared garments ' shirts '"
20413,haha i actually like that word a lot more than shirt . i also know that you can wear a tie underneath a shirt collar . i do that all the time for formal functions . what about you
20414,a tie underneath a collar ? thats as strange as a dog winning a mayoral election
20415,yep i'd agree with that . do you know the history of polo shirts ?
20416,well they cant be british since they have no cuffs
20417,haha good point . created by a famous tennis player . so not by polo players at all
20418,interesting . wonder what sells more . . . polo shorts or calvin and hobbes t shirts
20419,that's a great question . did you know the difference between button up and buttondown shirts ?
20420,no . which one was worn at billy mays funeral ?
20421,i'm not sure actually . but a buttondown shirt is where the collar fastens to the body of the shirt . a button up shirt does not do that .
20422,ah . that tells me something about buttoned up people
20423,did you hear about the popular trend in china during the cultural revolution ?
20424,i can't imagine it was pleasant .
20425,well they would layer as much clothing and shirts as they could and pop the collars . i bet that looked really weird haha
20426,"hi , how areyou ?"
20427,it is interesting how so many sports fans and players believe in curses and luck for whether they win or lose
20428,"yes , well , i guess a lot is inexplicable in sports . the luck factor is one that fans believe they have some influence over ."
20429,yes . i do love how the cub's curse of the billy goat was finally broken last year .
20430,"the cub's were like the red sox . the more they believed in a curse , the more powerful the curse seemed ."
20431,the germans at least admitted to cocky arrogance when they lost to south korea in the world cup rather than blaming it on divine internvention
20432,"the us took 3rd place in the first world cup in 1930 . it's been downhill ever since . is there a curse ? probably not arrogance , because the sport isn't that popular in the us ."
20433,"that is very true . the european countries have a lot of political stuff going on right now , so they rely in their abilities in soccer to cope sometimes ."
20434,i think that emotion trumps logic and economic gain in these countries . there are no economic gains for the countries that have played host to the wc .
20435,yes . and many of the countries that do well in the cup like uruguay are not exactly superpowers . it is a game like no other .
20436,"yes , tiny countries can dominate . the hungarian national football team had one defeat between 1950 and 1956 , and that was the world cup final ."
20437,"yes and in the last 5 tournaments , the defending champion has been eliminated in the group phase 4 times ."
20438,"the sport draws a lot of fans and generates a lot of income . soccer makes more than football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis and hockey combined . i guess the fortunes of teams vary quite a bit in that environment ."
20439,yes and some countries have players from other countries on their teams . plus many of the big champions have gotten trounced by much smaller countries .
20440,i'm impressed by the largess of some of the players though . german player mesut ozil donated his world cup bonus to pay for surgeries for 23 children in brazil .
20441,that is awesome ! that was very nice of him . did you know that the city that is going to host the 2022 final does not even exist yet ?
20442,"qatar is rich , so i guess they can put up a city pretty fast , especially with labor from the subcontinent ."
20443,yes but that world cup is going to have major problems with heat i suspect !
20444,very true . i think the fix was in when qatar was chosen . money changed hands .
20445,i wonder if the beetles were into soccer ? they are one of my favorite bands ever .
20446,"i suppose they were . they were british . they had no choice in the matter . well , i enjoyed chatting with you !"
20447,yes it is crazy that they were so popular that they had to stop touring because the current amps could not keep up with the screaming !
20448,"hi , how are you ?"
20449,i've been writing some poetry tonight did you know writing poetry was once an olympic sport ?
20450,i had no idea . how are you doing ? are you going for the gold ?
20451,"i would do great , but probably only in a you laugh you lose competition like cs lewis and tolkien used to play"
20452,are your poems depressing when read forward but inspiring when read backwards ?
20453,"no , mine are more like the chaos which is 274 lines of hard to pronounce words !"
20454,did you just write the japanese alphabet ?
20455,that is a complicated alphabet but i do not know it
20456,"when recited in order , it does form a poem . hopefully they got more than 9 for it ."
20457,oh interesting i did not know that . i have been busy following who all is going to be running in the next election
20458,really ! i love politics . who do you think will be in the next election ?
20459,i am from texas and i love beto o'rourke . i hope he wons for president and wins the election i just wish i could vote by mail like they do in oregon
20460,"that would make life easier ! serious question , did beto ever win a state election ? i know he lost to someone but cannot remember who and that was national ."
20461,yes he served in the us house for 6 years . he lost to ted cruz for senate this year but just barely .
20462,that's it . i heard he said he was willing to serve as vp if he didn't win the presidency .
20463,yes he is amazing . i think he would even beat the cat named hank who finished 3rd in a virginia senate election .
20464,nevada is the only state to have a ' none of the above ' as an option ? why not just skip it ?
20465,i would like that because it would let me voice my distaste for both candidates . i personally would probably vote for a dog one served as mayor for 13 years !
20466,"man , that dog lived a long time ! 13 years as a mayor ! ? ! ? ! ? !"
20467,politics must have suited him ! i wonder if they made him wear a shirt to the office ?
20468,nice chatting with you !
20469,do you like poetry ?
20470,i like poetry but don't read it as much as i think i should . but it's amazing . poetry can express so much emotion on so many different topics . do you like it ?
20471,"i like it yeah , i think that it expressed feelings in a unique way ,"
20472,"i agree . have you ever heard of nicole cooley , aka alice james , ? she has some great poetry out there . very unique"
20473,"i have actually , of marriage is one of her popular poems right ?"
20474,"yes it is . it's about her own experience with her marriage , and it's really good . it's really cool with her use of unexpected line breaks"
20475,"yeah being legally and emotionally bound to a person , thats something i can understand , she has a great writting style"
20476,"yeah , and so does elizabeth spires . she wrote a piece that raises really important questions about identity and memory and death"
20477,"i havent heard about her , i might google that poem later sounds interesting ,"
20478,it definitely is . and anne waldman wrote a collection called ' trickster feminism ' about feminism and the people who want to take women down
20479,"i thought that one was great , she won an award because of the poem right ? i heard she is an award winning activist"
20480,yeah i think she is . she wrote a great piece about the 2016 election . do you know anything about elections ?
20481,"yeah a bit , the talle candidate seems to win most of the times , interesting stat"
20482,yeah that's so weird . maybe that's why trump won the election in 2016 . did you know that voter turnout has been less than 2 or 3's of the population for the last hundred years ?
20483,"wow i agree with you that can be the reason , nevada has a none of these candidates option"
20484,"i wonder why that is . if you don't like any of the candidates , then why do you go to vote ?"
20485,"i know right , just stay at home an avoid voting , it would be funny if that option won though"
20486,"yeah , that would be so strange . do you like fashion at all ? i think it's pretty interesting but i'm not that informed . i know that in china , gangs would layer as many shirts as possible and pop their collars during the cultural revolution as a fashion statement ."
20487,"i do like fashion , and that is interesting , do you like to wear polo shirts ?"
20488,"i don't think i've ever worn a polo shirt . but did you know that originally polo shirts were invented for tennis players , and only later were they worn by actual polo players ?"
20489,"i didnt know that , all this time wearing polo shirts and i just found out about that , great fact , thanks ."
20490,"hi , how are you ? are you a soccer fan at all ?"
20491,"yes , i am . do you know that soccer players run an average of 7 miles in a game ?"
20492,yeah i've heard it was something crazy like that . do you root for a team in the world cup ?
20493,usually england . how about yourself ?
20494,england ? booo ! i root for the u . s . men's team when they actually make it . it hasn't been a good run for men's squad recently .
20495,i am a proud american so of course i root for the u . s . men's team but when they get knocked out i switch to england .
20496,"ah i see . i'm with you . i rooted for england last world cup actually too . at least the u . s . women's team is awesome , eh ?"
20497,"yeah , they sure are awesome . can you believe the super bowl is smaller than soccer's third biggest event ?"
20498,"it's hard to believe , but soccer makes more money than football , basketball , baseball and hockey combined so it makes sense . only the us and canada care about football really . the rest of the world loves soccer ."
20499,"i love watching soccer . the anticipation when the ball is getting close to the goal and hoping , or dreading , that a goal might be coming"
20500,me too . i think soccer and hockey are the best two sports to watch . the action and movement is constant . i wonder if the 2022 world cup will still be in qatar .
20501,i don't know . the awarding process is so corrupt . i think they have a ways to go on the infrastructure . i heard they are trying to make an air condition stadium that are solar powered .
20502,yeah apparently there have been huge human violent rights and labor rights violations where they are building for the world cup in qatar . i thought they might have changed the venue .
20503,they shouldn't have got it in the first place . it is too hot there for starters . soccer is definitely the world's most popular sport . did you that over 46 percent of the world population watched the 2010 fifa world cup ?
20504,"that's insane , billions of people . it's weird qatar is building so much when there aren't really any net economic gains for hosting the world cup . weird ."
20505,same thing for the olympics . some of the old olympics sites are decaying ghost towns
20506,i just saw the old site in barcelona last year . they actually turned it into something decent . a bunch of restaurants on the beach and a boardwalk .
20507,"that is awesome . i saw a slideshow recently about a few of the abandoned olympic sites . there was one in russia , one in eastern europe and perhaps one in canada , very sad"
20508,"interesting , was the one in russia the recent one ?"
20509,"yes , i think it was sochi , spelling ? ,"
20510,"yes , where germany got knocked out of by the south koreans lol . i believe france won ."
20511,i think you are right . do you think the u s men team will get better in the near future ?
20512,i hope so . i kind of agree when people say that the best athletes in the us don't play soccer . there's not enough money in it here .
20513,good point . hey it was nice talking with you
20514,"thanks , you too ."
20515,bye
20516,many people think it was a good thing that trump didn't attend barbara bush's funeral
20517,"hes the president , he wanted to golf instead . he pretty much can do whatever he wants lol did you know the presidents guest house is bigger than the white house ?"
20518,"i guess the actual white house is more for politics rather than housing guests . still , i don't get the whole obsession with gold . babe ruth , on the other hand , is the country's most famous golfer"
20519,"its really interesting that an average american golf course consumes 312 , 000 gallons of water per day !"
20520,"well , considering that land is larger than both delaware and rhode island together , that's not surprising"
20521,"thats all the courses combined thoug . an average gold course consumes 312 , 000 gallons a day , times that by how many courses are in america !"
20522,"which still seems like nothing compared to the golf course that requires 4 , 000 , 000 gallons a day . that course is in dubai"
20523,"right , that is a lot just for a gold course ."
20524,people love their gold . it's even in samuel l jackson's film contracts that he can play golf twice a week while in production for movies
20525,that must be nice ! choosing your schedule where you can golf twice a week . i would go snowboarding lol
20526,everyone has their preferences . apparently most people prefer listening to songs in major keys because kanye's song gold digger is the only minor key song in the ten most successful songs of all time
20527,"i honestly dont find any of his songs good and i think his personality , at least what he puts out there , is really annoying . i think its weird that he believes that aids is a man made disease ."
20528,"i'm not sure what he even means by manmade . he has his good sides though because during one of his concerts , he gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair"
20529,"man made , like this disease was made in a lab and given to the public . remember when he took over taylor swifts award speech and ranted on about something during her time on camera ."
20530,"what's funny is that two years before that incident , he did a snl skit skit mocking himself doing that exact thing"
20531,that is pretty ironic . maybe it was planned lol
20532,"probably not . still , he's had an influence on music and even cultural movements at a large level ."
20533,i know people keep saying that lol how is he an influence on music ? what makes people say hes contributed to these cultural movements ?
20534,"he's made changes in styles , and in addition , he's a record producer . kanye signed big sean , who had a 3 . 7 gpa and had a scholarship he turned down to pursue music"
20535,"that doesnt seem like a hug influence in music though , people sign up artist all the time on their music labels ."
20536,he's incorporated a lot of different genres in developing hip hop
20537,do you know much about politics ?
20538,i know some stuff . republican presidents seem to have a beard
20539,nice . the president has either been a republican or a democrat since 1853
20540,yeah i guess we do not hear of other parties much
20541,true . do you know when they started using the red and blue colors ?
20542,"yes that was pretty recent , in 2000s"
20543,yeah i though it was something that was always the case to be honest
20544,me too . did you know truman refused to be photographed in the dumbo ride ?
20545,yes he did not want to be associated with the republicans
20546,yeah that was pretty exptreme though if you ask me
20547,true . do you know what is the other name for the republican party ?
20548,"yes it is know as gop , grand old party"
20549,yea . do you like kanye west ?
20550,somewhat . he has one of the most successful songs though
20551,yes that is the gold digger song which is in minor key
20552,yeah . he believes that aids is a man made disease
20553,wow . but on the other hand he once gave his mic to a fan on a wheelchair
20554,that is nice of him . did you know he has big sean signed under his label ?
20555,yes and he was a great student in university before that
20556,yupp . it was nice chatting with you
20557,same here
20558,"i think trump should've have paid his respects to bush by going to his funeral even if he did not know him or never met him , what do you think ?"
20559,i think that it was a good idea for him not to show up .
20560,how come ?
20561,he might not have felt he belonged .
20562,i see . i think melania trump was captured in the photo that represented power .
20563,"melania trump is an appropriate representation at a funeral , i worry her husband would not have had as much decorum ."
20564,"haha , that is true . i did not know that the republican party was also referred to as the grand old party or gop"
20565,"i didn't always agree with george bush or barack obama on policy , but i think they represented the office of the president admirably ."
20566,"i 100 percent agree with you on that . trump seems to care about nothing , even when he's presented with reasonable compromises on issues , he prefers to leave them as problems as opposed to angering his supporters ."
20567,"i'm glad he played golf at maralago instead of attending the funeral . the less i see of him , the better ."
20568,"haha , speaking of golf , did you know that the average golf course consumes around 312000 gallons of water per day ? !"
20569,that's such a waste .
20570,"it really is a waste , especially the golf course in dubai that needs 4 , 000 , 000 gallons of water a day !"
20571,do you think trump should build a wall along the mexican border ?
20572,"no , to me it's a waste of resources . what do you think ?"
20573,"i'm surprised he reopened the government , it really upset his base of supporters that want the wall built ."
20574,"according to the news , it seems like the shutdown cost the us more money than what he was asking for to build the wall ."
20575,i disagree with most of trump's policies .
20576,i just can't believe there are so many people who idolize him or at least support him to lead the country . i think kanye west is trump's supporter .
20577,i think it's time for an independent candidate to get elected as president . don't think we've had one since the 1800's .
20578,"well , there was talk on the news that howard schultz would be running as an independent candidate for the next election . i think i'd support him if he ran for office ."
20579,i think i would vote for him too .
20580,did you see any of the ' incredibles ' movies ?
20581,"i did , i saw both actually , i like the director brad bird he does a good job , what bout you ?"
20582,"i like them both , but it was a long time between the first and the second ."
20583,"ya it was , i liked sam jackson's role in that playing frozone though"
20584,"well , he is good in anything so he was good in both of them . they couldn't keep the kids though because of the long time between them ."
20585,"right that makes sense , i remember in the first movie , they had to develop a bunch of new technology to make that movie possible for the hair , skin , and clothes"
20586,"there was 14 years between them , so of course things changed . the first one was based on a video game that was 13 years before the first ."
20587,"ah that is interesting , what do you think of domino masks ? those are the masks all the incredibles wear ?"
20588,"i guess most superheros and superheroines wear those , but it was good to have some females , and a nice depiction of family life ."
20589,"ya i think so , do you like any other superheros ? there is a book coming out on actually becoming a real life batman haha"
20590,"i think ' normalman ' is the funniest one , he is on a planet of superheroes , and is the only one without a power ."
20591,"haha that is a good concept , did you hear about pet force btw ?"
20592,"well , there are over 300 registered superheroes in the us , is that one of them ?"
20593,"haha i don't know , but pet force is a garfield spinoff and it has garfield and his friends as superheroes , sounds cool to me !"
20594,is it a movie ? if so who made it ? i know disney and pixar have done some of the recent superhero animations .
20595,"ya i think it was just a comic , but i would have loved a movie ! kind of crazy stan lee was going to change careers initially , good thing he didnt !"
20596,i am glad he created marvel ! what was his other possible career ?
20597,"i'm not sure , but he didn't switch when he was finally given creative control for making his own superhero characters like the hulk , obviously important haah"
20598,is the hulk a superhero or a supervillain ? superheroes can be so destructive that they made a series about the damage made by superheroes and how to fix it .
20599,"haha that is funny , but makes a good point , and ya i don't know he could probably be both , did you ever have a fish as a kid"
20600,"i never had a pet fish , but i have eaten some of the gill bearing aquatic animals for dinner ."
20601,"haha yes i had salmon tonight myself , i guess the oldest goldfish ever was 43 years old !"
20602,jellyfish though take the prize for age . there is one breed though to be immortal .
20603,"ya you're right , theyre also 98 percent water so they can easily evaporate unfortunately"
20604,"being immortal is good and all , but you can still die other ways . i'm not sure that jellyfish are actual fish though ."
20605,"no i don't think so , but there is a weird fish , it lives on land all of it's life , very strange !"
20606,"hey there , do you like movies ?"
20607,i do . i really enjoy superhero movies and comics
20608,nice . have you seen the incredibles movies ?
20609,i've only seen the first one . i haven't seen the 2018 incredibles 2 yet .
20610,"nice , me either but the first one was fun to watch . do you know who was the voice of edna mode"
20611,"yes , it's actually a guy ! brad bird ."
20612,i still wonder how they were not able to find a woman to play it
20613,i assume he had something very specific in mind for the character . he seems very eccentric as a director .
20614,"true , he only hired people that he thought would quit or be fired from pixar ."
20615,"i don't understand the intention behind that . but it is definitely interesting . superhero writers are known for weird things though . there is , for instance , a superhero called normalman"
20616,haha what is this superhero's superpower ?
20617,he has none ! he's the only man on a superhero planet without powers .
20618,oh okay i guess that is why the name . i wonder if anyone thinks about the collateral damage superheroes cause ?
20619,actually yes . there's also a comic about that .
20620,"nice , i wonder what the estimate is there in damages . at least they save us ."
20621,haha that is true . there are over 300 registered us superheros so there is a lot of damage to recover from
20622,yupp . stan lee alone maybe created more than half of them
20623,possibly . he wrote 15 dc comics too !
20624,"the man was a legend . there is even a garfield book called pet force , where garfield and his gang are superheroes !"
20625,he is definitely much missed in the comic world . he was a super hero himself in a way
20626,that is so true . it was nice chatting with you
20627,are you a superhero fan ?
20628,"i was once , but the world turned against me . now , i am a superhero fan incognito . . . you ?"
20629,"i like them , but i am not into all the lore and everything ."
20630,are you a fan of the best animated movie of 2018 ?
20631,which one is that ?
20632,"why , incredibles 2 of course !"
20633,i havent seen it . i am living under a rock . it has been a long time since the first one i feel .
20634,"yeah , the first one came out in 2004 . that's a long time between installments , especially for such a successful first film !"
20635,i think there was a video game in the mean time .
20636,"true , but this is the first fulllength film since the original ! the director , brad bird postponed the development of the sequel film to work on other projects ."
20637,"hopefully it can really live up to the hype . bird also voiced a character in the film , edna mode ."
20638,"he sure did ! the film has gotten high praise for its animation , voice acting , humor , action sequences , and musical score . any one of those makes the sequel a good bet for a great time !"
20639,"yeah , i hear michael giacchino was back to score again ."
20640,"yup , and i just love the work of holly hunter and craig t nelson too !"
20641,they are pretty incredible . no pun intended .
20642,did you know that there was a comic series written about cleaning up collateral damage caused by superheroes ? pretty creative !
20643,"i bet that would be fun to read , that is one thing super heroes always do , destroy everything , all in the name of saving the planet ."
20644,my favorite superhero fish is the black swallower ! its superpower is that it can swallow up to 10 times its own weight !
20645,that is awesome ! i am a bit fan of deadpool !
20646,"i am unfamiliar wit that character . is it a fish too ? my second favorite fish superhero is the seahorse . . . as the only fish wit a neck , it stands out from the rest !"
20647,"nope , he is just a regular superhero who is extremely sarcastic . but i'd be that jellyfish that is immortal . that sounds cool !"
20648,"but what is the superpower ? surviving the cambrian extinction ? well , i am off to eat some fish for dinner . have a nice evening !"
20649,you too !
20650,"hi , how are you ?"
20651,i'm fine ! how about yourself ?
20652,"well , thanks ! did anything seem interesting in your article ?"
20653,i'm astonished that einstein was good at music . he played two instruments .
20654,that's impressive . you usually don't see a math or science guy with a music side . nice combo .
20655,he probably could have gone pro if it hadn't been for that pesky science career .
20656,i'm glad he ended up on his feet . this science career might work out for him if he really tries . . .
20657,i'm also surprised that modern violins are preferred to the old expensive ones . i wonder what the difference is . better materials ?
20658,i thought the old ones were really expensive . maybe just the stravarious's . i know those go for millions !
20659,"i wonder if they are easier to play . i want to listen to the piece that haydn wrote , where the musicians gradually leave the stage ."
20660,were they going on strike ? in 2002 a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band . that's gotta be a bad show !
20661,"i guess creed must've been high or out of practice . i've been to bad concerts , but i never thought about suing ."
20662,i remember this and he laid on the stage for like 1 hour silent and then called it artist interpretation . . .
20663,"yes , that's exactly what the audience paid for . the ramones know how to do it . over 2000 concerts ? i wonder when they slept ."
20664,after the copious amount of drugs and alcohol wore off . they were crazy ! i would be afraid to got to their shows and i'm 6'6 ' and 250 pounds !
20665,they could have hired you as a stage bouncer . just leather up and grease your hair back . people would respect you . what about linkin park ? have you seen them ?
20666,"except if someone with a napoleon complex tries me , i would be the worst bouncer in the world . trust me , drunk short people tried me all the time in my younger days ."
20667,"ok , then you could see pink floyd when they play pompeii . no risk there ."
20668,at least there wouldn't be idiots yelling out money ! ! !
20669,maybe it's the same idiots at every concert yelling out the same stuff . whipping post !
20670,nice chatting with you !
20671,hi do you like going to concerts or watching them online ?
20672,"yes i love concert ! i saw linkin park a lot , but i did not see them 324 times in a year lol that's how many times they toured back in 2001"
20673,that must have been after their released their highly succesful debut album . did you ever see the ramones ?
20674,"yes i did , they tour are a lot too ! they did over 2000 concerts in only 20 years"
20675,"wow . that's a lot of touring . in croatia , there is still an ancient roman amphiteatre that is still used for concerts . that would be a neat place to see a show in ."
20676,"yes i wish i could have seen the pink floyd concert at the roman amphitheatre , that was in pompeii though and back in 1972"
20677,wow . wonder if there's any video of that ? in 2002 creed played a show that was so bad that 4 of the people in the crowd filed a lawsuit against the band . yikes !
20678,that would be embarrassing ! remind me never to watch a creed concert lol . do you like classical music by the way
20679,lol i've found a like it more the more that i've gotten older .
20680,yeah me too . i actually play classical music on the piano . did you know that classical music concerts can have really wild audiences while they are performing
20681,awesome that you play ! i can't get my fingers in tune with my mind to play . lol i didn't know that about audiences . i always pictured really quiet audiences . in 2011 a computer composed a piece of contemporary classical music .
20682,"that is cool , it's funny to that in australia there is a mall that will play classical music to scare teenagers away lol that way they don't loiter"
20683,that's funny ! lol there's a man named arthur lintgen and he can correctly identify a piece of classical music by analyzing the grooves on a vinyl record . that's pretty incredible !
20684,"that is definitely a talent ! and like i mentioned , apparently a city will also use classical music to deter crime , that's what they should have used instead of robocop lol"
20685,lol yes ! did you ever try to play the violin ?
20686,"i have a violin but i can't play it , what about you ?"
20687,i never did . my daughter too lessons at one time . she gave it up sadly . there is a violin made out of stone that is fully playable . wonder how it sounds ?
20688,"yes i wonder that as well . i also wonder how albert einstein sounded playing violins , apparently he was really good at it as well as being a genius"
20689,he was pretty gifted . he could also play the piano !
20690,that is incredible ! did you know that larry from the three stooges could actually play the violin really well ? they are going to send him to the conservatory
20691,wow . i never knew that ! it was nice chatting with you !
20692,do you like to go to concerts ?
20693,"yeah , but i don't have much money and i don't know many musicians , especially contemporary music like john corigliano ."
20694,did you know that linkin park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone ?
20695,"no , what was the name of the tour and i don't know them very much , they seems as popular as abba ."
20696,i've never heard of abba . who is that ?
20697,"they are a swedish band , very popular in the disco era , they recently turned down a 1 billion offer to reunite . i guess they don't like each other anymore ."
20698,"i've never heard of them . interesting , did you know that the ramones played 2 , 263 concerts ?"
20699,"that is a lot , in how many years they did this ?"
20700,it took them about 20 years .
20701,"that is around 100 concerts per year , it is a lot but it is doable . i hope they don't play as loud as deep purple ."
20702,do they play really loud ?
20703,"they have the world record for the loudest concert , 3 people in the crowd lost consciousness because it was too loud . the foo fighters also give loud concert ."
20704,interesting . i didn't know that . did they get in trouble ? i've seen the foo fighters .
20705,"the foo fighters did not get in troubles , but they gave a concert so loud that it showed on seismic monitors ."
20706,"yeah , i like dave grohl , have you seen them live ?"
20707,"no , never , but i have heard that dave grohl is a good musician . have you seen the foo fighters in concert ?"
20708,"yeah , i saw them and i've seen dave grohl play with queens of the soned age also ."
20709,that must have a been a loud concert as opposed to the 2010 lou reed's concert for dogs .
20710,"yeah , it was actually pretty good . i'm a big fan . well , nice chatting with you ."
20711,"you too , i wish you plenty of concerts . maybe you you try classical music , studies have shown that people who like heavy metal and people who like classical have similar tastes ."
20712,"take it easy , have a good rest of the day ."
20713,"are you a fan of linking park band ? ; ,"
20714,absolutely ! pretty sad about their lead singer chester bennington though .
20715,"yes . . . he had an amazing voice . . . did you hear that due to the success of their debut album , linkin park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone ?"
20716,"i did , thats amazing ! the ramones played a total of 2 , 263 concerts . . . they toured almost non stop for over 20 years . that must be tiring ! and fun !"
20717,"hey : , what happens on a tour stays on a tour : , but realistically they could get married on a tour and have a happy 20 years together ! : , lol"
20718,"in croatia , there is an ancient roman amphitheatre that is still in use as a concert venue"
20719,"wow , that's something i would like to see . and during the concert i wonder what sound acoustic does that place have : ,"
20720,probably amazing ! in 2002 a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band
20721,bad meaning the performance ? or maybe too loud or something ?
20722,"could mean a lot of things , the fact doesn't go into too much detail ."
20723,"in 1972 , pink floyd recorded a live concert at the ancient roman amphitheater in pompeii . . . with no audience did you see the dvd ? i loved it ; ,"
20724,"no i didn't . good to know though ! classical music concerts had loud , moving , wild audiences during the performance ."
20725,"the one in pompei was quite psychodelical : , not everybody like something like that ; ,"
20726,haha that would be trippy . a man named arthur lintgen can correctly identify a piece of classical music by simply analyzing the grooves on a vinyl record .
20727,"sounds like a scam ; , sorry , that's one of those things i would have to see to believe : ,"
20728,"maybe , i wouldn't know if he was lying or not though , because i know nothing about classical music lol a shopping center in australia is using classical music to stop teenagers from loitering"
20729,"ok how the heck does that work ? teenagers don't like this music , but it's not scary or anything like that : ,"
20730,maybe they put that frequency in it that makes humans feel fear
20731,"or maybe they hit that mystique tone that makes all humans poop ; , lol"
20732,"oh geea , i feel bad for those teenagers ! in 2011 a computer composed a piece of contemporary classical music ."
20733,i don't believe a machine can create music on a decent quality level . . .
20734,maybe .
20735,"alright , it was great chatting with you !"
20736,you too !
20737,"have a great night ; ,"
20738,hello ! did you know that months before apollo 11 nasa had seriously considered placing a un instead of an american flag on the mood ?
20739,"good morning ! no , i did not know that ! very interesting ."
20740,i didn't either ! the highest point on the moon is 1938 meters higher than mt . everest ! looks like we'll be learning of new things about the moon today . lol
20741,i wonder if anyone has been to the top ? do you know what the average age was of mission control during the first moon landing ?
20742,i doubt it ! lol . . . and i have no idea .
20743,the average age was 28 . even back then i bet that generation wasn't getting the credit they deserved !
20744,"lol i bet not . phobos , which is the largest moon around mars is one third hollow !"
20745,"oh , that is weird . surprisingly there is an asteroid with its own moon in our solar system ."
20746,"that sounds creepy . there is evidence of methane based life on titan , a moon of saturn ."
20747,"that's even creepier ! strange moon rock fact , astronauts from apollo 11 had to declare moon rocks through customs upon return to earth !"
20748,now that's funny ! how ridiculous though they made them do that . do you like birds ?
20749,"yes , i love birds . i feed them all the time . odd that birds have regional accents ."
20750,i didn't know that . that's pretty interesting !
20751,"well , if you like interesting bird facts , here's another : pigeons are one of 3 birds that produce milk for their young ! so , what about you , do you like birds ?"
20752,wha ! i didn't know that . yes i do . i have a pigeon fact . . . . the extinct dodo bird is actually a subfamily of pigeon .
20753,"oh , that is interesting . did you know that crows are among the most intelligent of birds ?"
20754,that i've heard before . i find it amazing that some birds can migrate from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping .
20755,that's amazing . it would be interesting to hear crows imitate human speech since they are capable of doing so .
20756,"that would be neat ! i wonder why people don't like crows ? in most birds , their bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers !"
20757,that would make sense since they can fly . they wouldn't be able to be too heavy .
20758,yes ! wish i was like that so i could fly ! lol it's been nice chatting with !
20759,"yes , it's been nice chatting with you as well . have a good day ."
20760,hey there do you like the moon ? i like looking outside right now and seeing it because it's so pretty
20761,it is pretty incredible . the highest point on the moon is 1938 m higher than mt everest !
20762,that is amazing ! i'm just shocked they were going to put a for the un instead of the american flag on the moon initially
20763,i know . it would kinda defeat the point of the space race .
20764,"yep i agree with you . did you know that moon dust is actually very powerful and harmful to humans , it could even cut through kevlar"
20765,"wow . i am surprised they havent tried to use it to make something stronger than kevlar then , but if humans couldnt touch it it would do us little good ."
20766,yep that's true . what do you think about saturn's moon ? it's called titan and there may be evidence that there is life on there actually
20767,"i think that is awesome , although it is methane based life , and other life in the universe could be an amazing thing ."
20768,i still think it would be interesting to find life in outer space lol . what do you think about birds by the way ? i love that they are delicious like the chicken i just ate
20769,birds are tasty . lol i think it is neat that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to fix their nests . .
20770,"i think so , i wonder how the birds of australia can mimic certain sounds , like they can sound like a camera or a car alarm lol that's crazy"
20771,that would be funny to hear . a bird sounding just like a car alarm .
20772,yeah or even a chainsaw lol that would scare me lol
20773,"for real , imagine that flying at you . id be running . lol"
20774,on a different topic what do you think about youtube ? i use youtube almost everyday
20775,i use it so much ! i even use it as a teaching tool !
20776,that's cool what kind of teaching ? it's crazy that it was started by only a couple of people back in 2005 and then sold to google in 2006 for at 1 . 65 billion dollars
20777,"general music . so many great videos , the kids love the how its made videos ."
20778,oh that makes sense . what is crazy is that youtube is the second largest search engine on the internet and youtube and netflix together make up half of all internet traffic
20779,id believe it . gangnam style got so many views they had to update the view counter .
20780,"lol you're right about that , i remember when everyone is watching that , what do you think about the police version of youtube called bluetube ?"
20781,do you use youtube ?
20782,yes i do . it is the second largest search engine on the net
20783,weird how i never thought of youtube as a search engine like google or bing
20784,it is actually a subsidiary of google ! maybe that is why . it was purchased in 2006 for 1 . 65 billion
20785,youtube was purchased by google ?
20786,yes it was . and was actually created by 3 former paypal employees
20787,that is cool . i never new that
20788,netflix and youtube make up half of peak internet traffic . thats a lot of eyes !
20789,i wouldn't be surprised
20790,gangnam style got so many views they had to change the view counter
20791,and justin bieber's baby is the most hated
20792,it was recently surpassed by youtubes own video this passed year . peopple must have really hated it to dislike it more than baby !
20793,did you know the police their own youtube called blutube ?
20794,i did not . there really should be a space one . i would love to see more things about the moon
20795,did you know moon dust is harmful to humans ?
20796,it also cuts through kevlar . thats really scary
20797,and causes moon hay fever
20798,"i wonder what has more epic views . mt everest , or the highest point on the moon"
20799,i think both would be mind blowing
20800,our moon is the fifth largest in the solar system . how cool
20801,did you know nasa considered putting a un flag instead of the american one on the moon ?
20802,have a great day !
20803,hello . how are you .
20804,hi i am good ! how about you ?
20805,"doing great , thanks . i did not know that youtube was created on 2005 . i thought it was 2000"
20806,"oh wow , i didn't know that either ! it's a good place to watch video's and learn about anything ! i love youtube ."
20807,me too and my toddler is addicted to it which i don't think is good . justin bieber's baby song is the most disliked video on youtube ? how crazy is that ? i though young people love bieber
20808,"really ? i thought that was one of his biggest hits ! it is crazy that youtube is the 2nd largest search engine on the net , that's huge !"
20809,"i know , it was really big few years ago . 2nd is a big deal since there are ton of search engine out there ."
20810,i know ! and it's kinda funny but smart that the police actually have their own youtube called blutube . . . . very smart !
20811,"yeah , it is worth checking out . my husband like like that information since he is a fan of cops . i still remember when psy's gangnam style era , we use to dance that song like crazy ."
20812,"oh cool i will check it out ! that song was so popular , i remember ! i didn't know that google bought youtube , for 1 . 65 billion ! that's a lot of money"
20813,"yeah it was a good move for google , i bet youtube is worth way more now . people use it all the time ."
20814,"oh yeah , youtube has to be worth billions now , it has grown so much ! you can literally find anything on there . i have learned a lot by googling youtube videos ."
20815,"yep , i actually fix our garage door by watching a video on youtube . i did not know einstein can play piano and violin ."
20816,that's good to know ! very interesting . in 2006 a group of people reached the top of britain's highest mountain and found a piano ! ! ! that's odd lol
20817,lol yeah it is odd . how can a piano get in there ?
20818,"i don't know hahahaa , that's like a huge mystery . i may have to look that up lol ! i used to play piano but i also wanted to play the violin but never did , i love the sound so much ."
20819,"yeah , i play a little bit when i was a child but it was not for me , my fingers are short lol ."
20820,"really ? i have very long fingers lol . i need to start playing again . did you know there is a violin that is made of stone . . . and it is 100 percent playable , how interesting !"
20821,"i imagine it will be uncomfortable to play , weight and all ."
20822,"definitely ! my granddaughter just started playing the violin , it can be so nerve wracking lol but she's only 9 ."
20823,"wow that great , i believe it is good to start kids early when learning musical instrument . it was nice talking to you . have a great day ."
20824,have agreat day !
20825,are you a fan of youtube ?
20826,"yes , although i do not like the recent changes they have made to their website ."
20827,"which changes were those , i must have missed them"
20828,"they did some changes to how their algorithms work , and so far the community has hated it , but youtube is doing anything despite all the hate they're getting ."
20829,"dang , i wonder if it will be worth it in the end . were you into the gangnam style craze years back ?"
20830,"i have to admit the song was catchy , and i did enjoy it . in fact , the video got so much views youtube had to upgrade the view count integer ."
20831,"right i hated the dance craze , but very catchy . it almost broke youtube with that !"
20832,"well youtube is a very large service , it is the second largest search engine on the internet ."
20833,"wow , i didn't know that . i bet it is behind google , i think google owns it"
20834,"google does , there are also other media cooperations that have partnerships with youtube ."
20835,nice that is awesome . were you one of the many people who disliked baby by justin bieber ?
20836,"no , but the dislike count seems to be doing fine without me , baby is the most disliked video on youtube ."
20837,"i was one of the dislikers lol , terrible song . do you play any instruments ?"
20838,"no , but i do look up to people who do , especially the violin or piano . their hands must be very tired after playing !"
20839,"i used to play piano , but i am not too good anymore . it may be like riding a bike but don't have the time anymore ."
20840,"well , i sometimes listen to electric violins in rock music or jazz fusion ."
20841,"that sounds really awesome , electric violins ?"
20842,"ya , they may not be made of wood , and they can have a electric pickup , amplifier and speaker ."
20843,"i want to youtube some of those , that interests me a lot ! it was so nice chatting with you !"
20844,"you too , have a nice day !"
20845,thanks you also !
20846,do you watch youtube ?
20847,i do ! you can truly find anything on there !
20848,"right , it is the second largest search engine right after google"
20849,"it definitely accounts for a lot of traffic , along with netflix it is 50 percent"
20850,"wow , that is a lot of internet traffic ! were you ever into the gangnam style phase ?"
20851,"eh , not really . i maybe watched it once ."
20852,"yea me too , i had to dance in front of everyone at a wedding , it was not my proud moment in my life . apparently that song almost broke youtube"
20853,i wonder if it has more likes than justin beiber's baby has dislikes .
20854,"not quite , i heard that is the worst liked song ever on youtube , i agree ! lol"
20855,same here . it is pretty bad !
20856,for sure lol ! did you know police have their own youtube for their job called blutube .
20857,i heard that . i guess they post training videos there . pretty cool .
20858,that is cool . do you watch bird videos on youtube at all . i like birds
20859,my favorite bird is the dodo bird !
20860,"that bird was awesome , sad it is extinct now . i think pigeons are related somehow"
20861,that would explain a lot . did you hear about those wild birds in alaksa
20862,"i did , don't they migrate to mexcio or something ?"
20863,"yeah , they so it without sleeping too ! pretty crazy"
20864,no way ! i can't drive an hour without wanting to sleep lol . it was so nice chatting with you !
20865,same here ! great chat ! have a nice day !
20866,"you too , enjoy your day !"
20867,"hi , how are you doing on this peaceful evening on the internet ?"
20868,"hello , just wonder if i can sing like the 7 year old girl who was brave enough to sing the national anthem at the mls game , can you sing ?"
20869,"i sing so bad that i have been banned by local gov't from doing it . i think if i sang at an mlb game , the umpire would eject me ."
20870,"lol , i know how you feel but that doesn't stop me from singing privately ! even with terrible voices , people are still brave enough to post themselves singing on youtube , i guess nothing will stop them from wanting to be superstars ."
20871,"it would not make me money , just make me a laughingstock . i will restrict my singing to the shower . kudos to the little girl for her bravery though ."
20872,"yeah i agree , did you know that youtube is the second largest search engine on the internet ? ! come to think of it , i think that's how justin bieber was discovered , i wonder what people search for on there ."
20873,"people are looking for videos of themselves singing , no doubt . bieber has the most disliked vid on there . does he care ? no ."
20874,"i know i'm guilty of being one of those contributors to peak internet traffic for netflix and youtube . speaking of , the police have their own youtube called blutube where they share law enforcement videos , is that legal ?"
20875,i'm sure it is .
20876,"oh ok , i think i prefer to watch videos of piano performances since its much more dramatic . bbc even decided that since there were no news worth reporting , they just went ahead and played piano music instead . i think some news channels should do that when they run out of quality material to report ."
20877,the fox news report turned into a piano recital . maybe fox would use liberace .
20878,maybe . do you play any instruments ?
20879,"no , i don't . i do like the piano and violin ."
20880,"me too , i didn't know the violin was also called a fiddle , it's even made from wood , how expensive do you think they are ?"
20881,"i would guess quite expensive , depending on the age . i think kids rent them because of the cost ."
20882,"oh ok , that seems a bit more logical since kids may not continue playing after they realize it actually requires a lot of effort into learning how to play an instrument unless you're albert einstein who was also a musical genius as well"
20883,einstein was an artist . i think drawing on both sides of the brain is important . i respect him . he probably wasn't as funny as larry fine though .
20884,"i'm not familiar with larry fine , was he a comedian and is that a stage name ?"
20885,"he was in the three stooges . he played the violin quite well . he was a comedy genius , but not so good at science ."
20886,"oh ok , that makes more sense now . i don't think electric violins are as popular as the traditional violins , which one do you like more ?"
20887,"traditional ones seem appropriate for most settings . i guess if you're playing heavy metal , you need amplification ."
20888,i also like the traditional violins as well though i am curious to hear what the violin made solely out of stone that is fully playable sounds like .
20889,hey there ! i've been browsing youtube all day . so bored ! how about you ?
20890,"i actually watched the new mortal kombat trailer on youtube today , it's cool that youtube allows exclusive content on their platform"
20891,"yeah , youtube is super popular . it's the second largest search engine on the net ."
20892,"yea , each minute 400 hours of content is uploaded onto youtube , and most of it sucks lol"
20893,"yeah , but still so many people visit youtube . youtube and netflix make up half of the internet traffic in north america . wild ."
20894,"yea , it's pretty cool baby by justin bieber is the most disliked video on youtube"
20895,"now that's a pretty useless video . i like to watch educational videos , actually . i like to watch videos about space , the moon . . . things like that ."
20896,"yea i love reading about that stuff , did you know the apollo 11 astronauts considered placing a un flag on the moon instead of the us ?"
20897,"i did not , but that sounds interesting . i like space because there's so much we don't know about it . i guess methane was just discovered on saturn's moon , though !"
20898,"yea , i hope we are able to discover life one day on one of saturn's moons"
20899,"me too . flying all the way up there , even with a satellite , is incredibly expensive and timeconsuming ."
20900,and dangerous too . the dust on earth's moon can cut through kevlarlike material and cause moon hay fever
20901,oh no ! had no idea about that . maybe one day we'll discover some more cool things about space !
20902,"yea , i'd love to find out more about phobos , it is one third hollow , very strange for a moon"
20903,"funny that you mention hollow , because i just read a fact the other day that said that birds' bones are so hollow that their entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers . . ."
20904,"birds are such cool animals , especially hummingbirds , they steal spider webs for their nests"
20905,i think it's especially interesting to read about migrating birds .
20906,"yea , there are some birds that fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping"
20907,"aviation has always been so fascinating to me . between birds , outer space , and planes , my mind is always blown !"
20908,yea i love learning about birds and how they evolved from dinosaurs
20909,which is why youtube is so useful at times !
20910,"sometimes . well it was nice talking with you , have a good day"
20911,do you know who malea emma tjandrawidjaja is ?
20912,no i dont . who is she ? what does she do ?
20913,she a 7 year old little girl who sang the national anthem at a mls game and apparently she did marvelous .
20914,"oh , thats great ! 7 years old . that is quite young . i guess she has a great career ahead of her ."
20915,she hummed the first line to herself and then let loose . all at that young age in front of such a large crowd . that's remarkable .
20916,i would have been terrified . how did she get chosen ? what else has she done ?
20917,well that performance in particular went viral !
20918,she must be planning her next performance . i bet she could go on the road during the summer and perform at mlb games .
20919,i bet when she was only three she performed in a talent show at la live in downtown los angeles .
20920,this kid must be phenomenal . does she also dance and act ? she could be huge .
20921,i'm not sure but by the time she was 5 she played at carnegie hall .
20922,"i guess she plays the piano , or the violin ? or both ?"
20923,"wouldn't surprise me she going to be a prodigy . they've given her a nick name of comic spitfire and say she stole heart right and left , wonderful ."
20924,"speaking of pianos , did you know that freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude ? i would this girl to have a chance to use that piano ."
20925,yeah that would be pretty cool ! emma based her singing style on christina aguilera .
20926,"that is a great role model . i think the kid has a bright future . by the way , did you know that there is a violin made out of stone that is fully playable ?"
20927,"wow i wonder if the sound is somewhat different , do you know ? you can probably find out on youtube ."
20928,i bet it ' rocks ' pretty hard ! lol . an aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship hindenburg . i wonder how it sounded . tinny ?
20929,i was concerned about the added weight but im pretty sure it was calculated in .
20930,"yes , it did not weigh much . i hope that it sounded good enough . what about the piano found on top of britain's highest mountain ?"
20931,i heard about that apparently it's a mystery as to how or who put it there . do you watch netflix ?
20932,"i used to watch netflix . i dont now . great shows , very convenient , very addictive . lol . anyway , great chat !"
20933,you too ! netflix and youtube make up half of peak time internet traffic on the web .
20934,"yes , everybody loves their video entertainment !"
20935,"right , have a great day my friend ! parting note police have their own channel called blutube ."
20936,good morning !
20937,good morning ! i can still see the moon outside how about you ?
20938,unfortantely i can't see it today due to the clouds . it's lovely though ! it's the fifth largest natural satellite in our solar system !
20939,that's amazing . the dust on the moon is said to be able to cut through kevlar !
20940,whoa i didn't know that . i need to watch some more youtube univeristy lol . youtube is the second largest search engine on the internet ! it's got everything !
20941,it really does ! netflix and youtube together make up half of peak internet traffic in north america . safe to say it's not going anywhere anytime soon .
20942,even the police have their own youtube blutube ! media uses it as well like bbc . it's crazy
20943,it is . did you know gangnam style got so many view that they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits ?
20944,i knew animal videos were super popular on there but i didn't know that . people love bird videos . especially those where the birds sound like other things like car alarms . the wild birds in australia can mimic all kinds of car noises and alarms !
20945,i've heard that . i couldn't imagine those living around here . i also have a hard time fathoming that the dodo bird is a subfamily of pigeon .
20946,that is weird . a neat thing though is hummingbirds use spiderwebs to repair and build nests !
20947,that's possibly the most adorable thing i'll hear all day . they are so tiny and cute . it's crazy to think about the fact that their bones are so hollow their entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers .
20948,so fragile ! it's interesting when you think about how their digestive and respiatory systems are uniquely adapted just so they can fly !
20949,"absolutely . fragile but strong too , some birds can fly from alaska to mexico without sleep when migrating ."
20950,that's more than i can do . the only birds without known wings are the moa and elephant birds but both are extinct .
20951,that's crazy ! it's also crazy how closely birds descended from dinosaurs and dramatically diversified around 66 million years ago .
20952,it is ! and they devolved wings dpending on the need for them . whether its flight or swimming .
20953,their social monogamy is very interesting as well . most just mate for one season but the species that mate for life are the most interesting .
20954,like some penguins and i believe some swans . it's amazing . some male penguins will also be in charge of keeping an eye over their eggs while the females go out and hunt .
20955,"i know , so cool . it sucks that our activity on this planet threatens so many species with extinction . around 1200 bird species ."
20956,like the spix macaw and the alagoas foliagegleaner from brazil . . . they aren't confirmed for sure gone yet but researchers are pretty certain .
20957,are you a fan of soccer ?
20958,"i watch soccer , but i am trying to understand the entire game , only thing i know is when a team score ."
20959,"me too , lol . i learned a lot more during this last world cup , did you watch that at all ?"
20960,"i watched a few games , but not enough to understand what was going on . i was with friends and cheer when a team score ."
20961,"me too , i was all about brazil this last world cup since the us wasn't in it again"
20962,"i see that they are one of the better teams , i wonder why the scores are so low ? it's hard to score ."
20963,i think everyone is just super good that it is hard to score lol . do you know mesut ozil ?
20964,"no i don't think i do , that bad when i don't know any of the team members ."
20965,i just know him because he donated his world cup winnings to pay of kids in brazil's surgeries
20966,"wow , that was thoughtful of him , it would be nice if more wealthy people donate to different causes ."
20967,for sure . soccer makes more money than all the other sports combined . i think they get more money because of this .
20968,"yes you are right , did you know the american team never came in lower than third place since 1991 , i am referring to the women team ?"
20969,"yea , the men not so hot . i think the men got 3rd place in the world cup once , in 1930 !"
20970,"did you know american used the name soccer , because it is slang for association football ."
20971,i always knew it as soccer so that makes sense . i never knew it was called association football to be honest
20972,do you like to wear boots or you prefer shoes ?
20973,"shoes for sure , but i like a good winter boot . i needed them so much this year from this winter , you ?"
20974,"yes , i bought two pairs , did you know ugg boots were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after leaving the cold water ?"
20975,"i never knew that , i could totally see it ! it was so nice chatting with you !"
20976,"jon stewart was a skilled soccer player in college . you have a good night also , nice chatting with you ."
20977,i would never have guessed that ! enjoy your night !
20978,hello how are you doing today ?
20979,doing great .
20980,that's good . do you like association football aka soccer ?
20981,never really followed it . i like american football though .
20982,did you know the city set to host the 2022 qatar world cup does not exist yet ?
20983,they have a lot of work to be getting done then huh .
20984,yes they do . the hungary national football team only had one defeat in 6 years and that was in the world cup final .
20985,that would be heartbreaking . to win all year long and then lose in the world cup . i guess that means they won at least 5 world cups in that time though .
20986,that would be devastating . the us got third place back in 1930 .
20987,thats interesting . do you know who jon stewart is .
20988,i do . he played soccer didn't he ?
20989,he is a comedian but he played soccer . he was pretty good to .
20990,soccer makes more money than most sports combined .
20991,thats understandable considering its popularity among non us nations . i would say at least football and basketballl have it beat over here .
20992,i agree . americans call it soccer because it was slang for association football .
20993,i hear the us womens team is pretty good .
20994,"yes , they are pretty good . there exist a variation of soccer where 3 teams face each other at the same time ."
20995,the womens team has never placed below third since womens world cup started all the way back in 91
20996,that's really good . do you like boots ?
20997,yeah i guess . they are very useful .
20998,did you know ugg boots were invented by surfers ?
20999,i didnt know that . i have never had a pair of ugg booots myself .
21000,me either . the nokia company got big by making rubber boots .
21001,thats interesting . well im gonna have to be going have a good one .
21002,are you a big fan of watching sports ?
21003,"i'm a bigger fan of playing them than i am of watching them , especially sports like soccer"
21004,have you watched womens soccer before ? they say the us's team is undefeated
21005,"i heard something about that too ! i guess the last team they played against was scotland , too"
21006,which country do you consider to have produced more soccer talent ireland or scotland ?
21007,i'm not sure since i don't watch it enough to keep track . i guess they'll be playing the world cup in france in the summer
21008,i hope they keep it up lets see how long they can maintain that winning streak
21009,"it's nice that they'll have a bit of a break before playing in france , and they can work on their strategy . i can't imagine playing with jetlag"
21010,thats a recipe for some fatigued players they definitely need to get acclimated first before the big game
21011,for sure . but this break will be good for them so they can rest their legs before something as important as the world cup
21012,have you watched the world cup in previous years ? do you remember what zinidine zidane did ?
21013,"i don't usually watch it , so no , i don't . what happened ?"
21014,during the game against italy the french player zidane got angry at one of the italian players cocked his head back and hit him like a rhino lol
21015,that's crazy ! what's crazier is that the city for the 2022 fifa world cup doesn't exist yet
21016,well i guess they better hurry up and get to building lol
21017,"they won't gain anything economically for hosting , but i guess it's good publicity"
21018,thats what i dont understand how can they gain nothing when they make millions from the tourism it brings all those people buy food and stay for vacation
21019,"because it costs them more to update their infrastructure . for the us , that doesn't seem like it would be as big of a deal , especially since the american team never places below third as of 1991"
21020,have you seen the ruins of the olympic stadiums in athens its pretty sad they are all looking horrible
21021,"it was so long ago though . i'm not sure if soccer was even a sport then , though it makes more money than the other major sports combined"
21022,no lol i'm talking about the stadiums from the olympics in 2004
21023,hello ! do you like birds ?
21024,i do like birds . generally just eat them though . lol do you like birds ?
21025,"i enjoy eating them as well , but i like looking at them too ! there are some pretty cool looking birds out there !"
21026,yes there are . i wonder if we are going to have problems with the server here . hm . some birds fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when migrating .
21027,that's pretty amazing ! hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests .
21028,"yeah , those thieving little beasts ! they look beautiful but they are sneaky !"
21029,lol yeah they are . there are wild birds in australia that can mimic things like car alarms and chain saws . can you imagine if you heard a chainsaw flying around you at night !
21030,"yeah , i would probably get a rifle and start shooting ! lol probably start wearing protective hats too ."
21031,"yeah , if they came imitate that i be they can imitate a lot of things . like perhaps growling or crying . pretty scary ."
21032,probably imitate the sound of atm beeps and then take out your cash !
21033,these birds are gonna get too smart and take over someday ! the dodo bird is actually a member of the pigeon family .
21034,the dodo was not terribly smart . and pigeons dont seem too smart either . what do you think of our friend the sun ?
21035,"yeah , they do seem to belong together . i love the sun , i can't wait for it to be warm again so i can go sit in it !"
21036,our friend the sun is quite big . and accounts for most of the mass in the solar system .
21037,"it is actually white , but perceived as yellow !"
21038,"yes , the trickery of the atmosphere has deluded us ! if you view the sun from the moon , it is white ."
21039,crazy ! a lightening bolt is 5x hotter than the suns surface .
21040,"i dont think it would be easy to harness the energy of lightning , but the sun , on the other hand , offers much energy ."
21041,"yes , it produces enough energy in one second that could meet the needs of the planet for 500000 years ."
21042,"if we could capture it and store it , that would be great ! anyway , great chat !"
21043,it was great chatting with you too !
21044,"yesh , have a great weekend !"
21045,bye !
21046,"hi , how are you ? what do you think our friend the sun ?"
21047,i love it ! cant live without it
21048,"yes , the sun serves many of my daily needs without fail . i appreciate his constancy ."
21049,did you know its actually white and not yellow !
21050,"yes , that is a trick of the atmosphere ! i think if you look at the sun from the moon , it is white ."
21051,even with everything else in the solar system . the sun still counts for 99 . 86 percent of mass
21052,"it is a big boy , and really does hog the mass . but that is fine . there is enough to go around ."
21053,"it produces enough energy in a second to power our planet for 500 , 000 years ."
21054,"if we could capture and store it all , that would be great . but where could we keep it ? its just so much !"
21055,im unsure we could . just like the energy produced by lighting
21056,"that would be great , if we could capture the energy of lightning ! probably too difficult though . solar is the better way to go ."
21057,and a bolt of lightning is hotter than the surface of the sun ! sounds dangerous
21058,"yes , it does . ill make sure to avoid the lightning bolts . or wear a special hat to protect me ."
21059,hats can also offer some protection from sunburns !
21060,"yes , that is true . the sun is a ferocious friend . he can sometimes go overboard . a good hat can be our ally ."
21061,did you know that cowboy hats were not the most popular in the old west ?
21062,"i guess those movies have lied to me ! i thought everyone wore a cowboy hat , cowboy or not ."
21063,thats what i thought as well ! . they looks like they gave good shade as well
21064,what was the most popular hat then ?
21065,it was called the bowler . do you know what those are ?
21066,"yes , the round hat . very stylish , but not really a cowboy hat . hm . that is interesting . anyway , great chat !"
21067,you as well ! have a great day !
21068,did you know that the sun is actually white ?
21069,"i did not know that , i have been coloring it the wrong color my whole life , lol ! why is it white ?"
21070,it just is . it only looks yellow due to the atmosphere .
21071,"that makes sense , the sun is amazing , you know what is hotter than the sun ?"
21072,"no , what else is ? a lightening bolt ?"
21073,"yea , a lightening bolt is 5x hotter ! that is hot !"
21074,wholly molly ! that is hot .
21075,"that is so hot , i can't imagine getting struck by lightning , it should just burn that crap out of you !"
21076,"me either . what about birds , do you like birds ?"
21077,"i like birds , they are so interesting . i like seeing hummingbirds they are amazing"
21078,well apparently birds bones are hollow .
21079,"i wonder if that helps them fly better . which weighs more , the bone or the feather ?"
21080,i think the feathers actually weight more . pretty crazy .
21081,"wow ! how don't they crush themselves landing , we will never know . i heard wild birds in australia can do crazy things"
21082,really ? like what do they do ?
21083,"the can mimic different sounds like cameras , car alarms , and chainsaws . they probably have evolved that way because of tourism"
21084,"wow , that must be pretty freaking cool . some birds can fly from alaska to mexico without sleeping ."
21085,"wow , i can barely drive 2 hours without almost falling asleep . birds are amazing , i think birds evolved from dinosaurs or something like that"
21086,"yeah , i think so . although the dodo bird is a sub family of pigeon ."
21087,"that is awesome , i thought that bird was extinct ! it was so nice chatting with you !"
21088,you too .
21089,"hi , how are you ?"
21090,"fantastic , how are you ? hey are you one of 58 million netflix subscribers ?"
21091,"i am very well , thanks . yes , i am a subscriber . do you subscribe ?"
21092,"yes , i do subscribe although i was quite stunned the global number wasn't higher : , allegedly the company spends 20 time more on postage than bandwidth something tells me that number may rise after the usps jacked up the costs of postage , again !"
21093,yeah ! i am not sure what they spend all their postage on though . . . . do they still do the dvds ?
21094,i believe they do still mail dvd's . i don't even own a dvd player anymore so i'm not certain . that was a very short process for me as red boxes popped up as a better alternative . i keep trying to watch the new ted bundy documentary on netflix but i fall asleep haha
21095,hahaha ! i tend to fall asleep watching tv too . maybe that's a sign . i live in chicago and its supposed to be 40 tomorrow . that will be a good day to watch some netflix !
21096,"ahhhh ! i live in nc and if we get down to 40 above zero i'm dressed like an eskimo . we may get some ice tonight and places are already closing down , not just schools . we don't do cold weather well at all . : d definitely a netflix day tomorrow . maybe rewatch parks and rec with chis pratt if the bundy docu creeps me out too much ."
21097,we got 7 inches of snow yesterday and it was the worst ! i hate the cold . . . i love pratt though ! he goes to visit kids in the hospital dressed as starlord !
21098,"hats off to ya for living there i couldn't even visit ! anyone who takes the time to visit kiddos in a hospital is an a plus human in my book . oddly enough , i had no idea there had been any sequals to the original jurrasic park for chris pratt to joke to steven spielberg about giving him the lead in jurassic park 4 . like , wasn't one enough ? !"
21099,"right ? i never watched the original . i read the book first and it was so good that i didn't want the movie to ruin it for me . and im not usually the guy who reads the book first so i am keeping that memory , 25 years later . . ."
21100,"lol i watched the first one way back in the nineteen hundreds , ! , and that was plenty . i remember it being huge at the time . apparently it took six hours to render one frame of a rainsoaked t rex in jurassic park . sometimes i wonder if the film industry truly requires that much time or if they simply have a different work ethic and bosses than blue collar ants on a dirtmound like myself ."
21101,ha !
21102,chris pratt waited tables at bubba gump shrimp company . . . buuuuuuuut that was in maui . does it count as being a broke kid living in maui and working as a waiter ? i'd rather be broke in maui than anchorage any day . . .
21103,"definitely ! can you imagine tipping him one day and then watching him on parks and rec the next ? ' hey honey , our waiter's on tv ! '"
21104,that would be funny . i had no idea chris pratt was in so many movies and has been on tv for a solid decade now . it kinda makes me feel old .
21105,i always feel old watching the vmas or any music awards . i have no idea who any of these kids are ! and i'm only 40 . . . i turned into my dad !
21106,"tell me about it ! we just saw metallica last night with our three sons , 21 , 18 and 14 , there were people sitting on their phones and my youngest son was floored . of course we've taken them to all sorts of concerts , from buffett to buckethead to anthrax and slayer . . . . so it's even worse having kids and legitimately asking if ariana grande is a person or something new at taco bell then hearing the music and saying , ' oh heck naw . pass ! '"
21107,buffett ! ? ! ? ! so much fun ! my daughter is 5 and i so want her to experience the parking lot before it's too late . . .
21108,"buffett is my annual holiday . the kids love it and because i go every year , it's an all day adventure and yeah , the parking lot is the place to be if not partying on the lawn . i fear the day i have to sit at a buffett show ! take her take all your friends it's legit excellent for families . watch out for the left handed cigarettes though ; ,"
21109,ha ! nice chatting with you !
21110,"hi , how are you ?"
21111,i'm great ! how are you doing today ?
21112,"i am well , thanks . have you seen jurassic world , fallen kingdom ?"
21113,"no , i haven't , though i did see the first jurassic film ."
21114,i have not seen it either but i did read the book . it was soooo good that i never saw the first one in fear that it would taint my love for the book .
21115,that's a good point . sometimes films can ruin things . is fallen kingdom based on a book ?
21116,"i am not sure but i do not think so . creighton , sp ? , came out with two and the first one was great while the second one was ok . i do not think he continued writing after the second one ."
21117,"crichton , i believe . i bet he got tired of writing them . he must have made a ton of cash off the first movie as well . no incentive ."
21118,"right ! i wonder how much writers make off of movies , not the bump in book sales but strictly from the movie ?"
21119,"well , since he wrote the book , i imagine his deal was good . usually writers don't make as much as actors . are you a fan of netflix ?"
21120,i am . are you ?
21121,"i have watched them in the past , but not so much now . they burn up an astonishing amount of bandwidth ."
21122,i heard that . them and youtube . are you more of a fan of youtuve ?
21123,"i go to youtube for music and news . youtube is owned by google , so i guess they share search engine technology ."
21124,"wow . that makes sense , since it is the second largest search engine ."
21125,what do you think the folks at blockbuster thought when they saw the rise of netflix ?
21126,so angry ! the loss of revenue and ulitmately demise had to be a cause of anger for many . although the corporate offices probably got golden parachutes . . .
21127,"very true . the top people did fine , even though they could have bought netflix for cheap back in the day ."
21128,sad that all the little people had to lose their jobs though . maybe if they were better visionaries . . .
21129,"most people cannot foresee the power of the internet . netflix still pays a ton on postage . why , do you think ?"
21130,nice chatting with you !
21131,did you see the jurassic park movies ?
21132,yes i did actually the last one i saw was the fallen kingdom and you ?
21133,yes me too . did you know the dinosaurs only appear for 15 minutes in the movie ?
21134,that is very little for a movie that is supposed to be about dinosaurs
21135,yeah exactly . did you know the ride cost more to build with the same name than the movie ?
21136,"yes the ride was 110 million and the movie just 63 million , crazy"
21137,yeah . chris pratt joke about being the lead many years earlier and then got the role
21138,wow smart guy . it took them forever to make the scene where the trex appears all soaked
21139,"yeah 6 hours for each frame , that is crazy long"
21140,i know . do you know who directed it ?
21141,yes ja bayona . do you like netflix ?
21142,i love it . did you know n the morning in na it makes for 33 percent of all the bandwidth ?
21143,they are amazing . and with youtube make half of the peak internet traffic
21144,yeah . did you ever use blockbuster ?
21145,i sued to before netflix . those guys made a bad decision not buying netflix
21146,yeah they could have bought it for 50 million and make billions now
21147,right ? netlfix stills spend more on postage than on bandwidth
21148,yeah about 20 times more but what are they shipping now ?
21149,i wonder too . do you know how netflix came about ?
21150,yes the guy who founded it got a late fee for a vhs and i guess had enough
21151,yeah well that was a good thing in the long run for him
21152,"hi , how are you ?"
21153,good . what is on your schedule for tonight ? movies ?
21154,yes . it was boxing but movies sound better . do you like movies ?
21155,"i am more into tv series but i heard the jurassic world , fallen kingdom is good ."
21156,i have not seen it . i saw the first one with chris pratt but no more . did you see the original ?
21157,no i didn't . but the jurassic park rid cost 110 mil create . crazy ! !
21158,that's a ton . plus the dinosaurs only appeared for 15 minutes !
21159,yes ! did you know that chris pratt joked about spielberg giving him the lead in jp ?
21160,i did not . that's crazy that it came true !
21161,i know . do you do netflix or
21162,i do ! do you ?
21163,heck ya ! i heard that blockbuster declined so many offers to buy netflix . sounds like a bad move .
21164,"yeah . i guess their one remaining store in alaska is proud but the other shuttered stores , not so much !"
21165,"absolutely ! so sad . after getting a late fee on a vhs copy of apollo 12 , reed started netflix ."
21166,"what a terrible revenue of 40 . but for that 40 , they would still be in business !"
21167,"maybe , but did you know that netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth ."
21168,that's a ton . why so much ?
21169,well netflix and youtube together make up half of peak internet traffic in north america . that is why !
21170,that's crazy ! i guess videos do take up more bandwidth .
21171,yes ! did you hear that the jurassic park ride cost 110 mil to create ?
21172,wow that's a lot ! nice chatting with you !
21173,hi do you enjoy dance ?
21174,i love it . do you know what dance emilia clarke did when she auditioned for the games of thrones ?
21175,"i actually do not know , what ? bruce lee was a dancer too"
21176,"nice , she did the chicken dance and the robot dance . what sort of dance did he do ?"
21177,hahha she is so funny . bruce was a chacha champion
21178,"haha yes she is . oh wow , the guy had so much talent it seems"
21179,yup . did you know ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of shoes in a week ?
21180,"wow that is a lot of money too . in the show mr . rogers , in an episode he learns to breakdance"
21181,"nice , i want to see that . did you know jackson has a patent in a device that helps to achieve smooth dance moves ?"
21182,i wonder what happened to it now that he is no longer with us
21183,hmm good questions actually . did you know tupac was also a dancer ?
21184,he was ? what kind of dance did he participate in ?
21185,"he was actually a ballet dancers , i know it seems off but he was"
21186,hmm interesting . parrots are really good at dancing in tune with music
21187,nice babies too they tend to dance when they hear music
21188,yeah that is sweet . there are some ballet shoes that make drawings based on how the dancers move
21189,"nice i want a pair of those too , not that i am a great dancer or anything but yeah"
21190,the first moonwalk dance was done by bill bailey in 1955
21191,wow i thought it was a jackson thing this whole time . interesting
21192,me too . do you like the band imagine dragons ?
21193,"i love them and all their songs , i wish i could see them in concert too"
21194,do you enjoy the star wars movies ?
21195,"why yes , i do . what about you ?"
21196,i do as well . were you aware that as of 2018 the franchise was estimated to be worth 65 billion making it the fifth highest grossing media franchise ? that's a lot of money .
21197,i didn't know that . it is alot of money . funny james earl jones only got 7500 for recording all of darth vader's lines for star wars .
21198,that's crazy ! i was not aware of that . his voice is so iconic to the franchise .
21199,"yeah , it is . i can't imagine anybody else doing darth vader but him ."
21200,me either . did you know that star wars has even been dubbed in navajo ?
21201,"i had heard that , it's very popular movie so i guess it's been dubbed in many languages . did you realize that 20th century fox was convinced it was going to be a flop ?"
21202,i had heard that . i believe lucas made a deal to get merchandising rights because of that ?
21203,"yes , he did . such a smart man . he agreed to forgo an additional 500 , 000 directing fee in return to keep the licensing and merchandising rights for himself ."
21204,wow ? ! the merchandising for that franchise is big business . people are insane about collecting it . that was an incredibly good business decision on his part .
21205,it made him a billionaire and cost fox billions . i bet they kick themselves about that decision all the time . lol
21206,oh i'm positive that they do . it's off topic but do you enjoy any country music ?
21207,why i sure do . do you ?
21208,i like the older stuff like patsy cline or johnny cash . did you know that george strait and jeff bezos are cousins ? !
21209,"how interesting , both of them so successful and rich from different industries . i didn't know that there were only 2 african americans in the country music hall of fame . did you ?"
21210,it is very interesting . i did not know that . i'm honestly surprised there are any . i can't think of any african american country artists .
21211,"i was thinking charley pride , but that was the only one i could come up with . i know there are more in country music nowadays , though ."
21212,i must admit that i am not very knowledgeable about the modern artists . were you aware that henry ford helped popularize country music by financing it because he was afraid of the ' urban decadence ' of jazz music ?
21213,"i did't know henry ford had his hand in country music . i can believe the urban decadence of jazz , though . did you know clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast , pianist , and has scored several films ?"
21214,i did not . i took him for more of a country guy .
21215,i am a huge star wars fan . have you ever seen them ?
21216,"oh hell yea , i was a fan in their 20th century fox days and still today with them being owned by disney"
21217,it is amazing how much a pop culture phenom it has become . i wonder if the actors or george lucas had any idea way back in 1977
21218,"no way , the value has gone up to a whopping 65billion ! back then he was just making a space movie , now its a phenom"
21219,so true . there is even epic series of books that give back story and what the future was after the original trilogy . i have to admit that having read the books i was rooting for them to pull from those but they didn't
21220,oh you read the old extended universe stuff ? like with han and leia's kids before kylo ren was a thing ?
21221,yes ! i was so hoping that when they introduced rey she was going to be the girl twin and that luke was off living happily with mara jade and his son ben but nope .
21222,"i had read about a lot of people speculating thats what they were gonna do with the plot , but would that have been too obvious ? i dont mind the route they took , i still really like the new movies"
21223,i heard something about they wanted to expand it beyond being just a skywalker story . which kind of makes me sad because that is really the whole point of star wars . the new movies are pretty good though . the graphics are amazing .
21224,"i heard that these 9 movies are the skywalker saga and everything beyond that is just cool stuff happening in the universe , which i'm all for . like jon favreau is making that tv show about mandalorian bounty hunters . i think they need to not do movies like solo and come up with more original characters like rogue one"
21225,it would be amazing to watch a series about the bounty hunters ! i didn't mind solo . i like getting the backstory on some of the beloved characters of the past .
21226,"i liked it too but if they want to get that magic again and if they want to stray from the skywalker family , they need to develop a new cast of characters"
21227,and give them some depth . i don't think they developed poe enough in the movies yet . i think he could have a really interesting backstory .
21228,yea apparently hes gay too ? and has a long lost love who taught him to be a pilot ? something they never even touched on in the movies . he could be such a well developed character if they give him some more screen time
21229,i would love to see a mini series for tv about the liberation of the kids on that casino planet . i feel like after they were visited in the third trilogy there is going to be some sort of uprising and it would make for an amazing movie .
21230,"i hope so , there should be some payoff to that planet and i think there will be . and since jj is finishing the story he started , i feel he will end it in a satisfying way"
21231,his work is amazing . it is no wonder that he was able to secure a guinness world record for this franchise .
21232,"yea i agree . i think jj was a big fan of jazz music too . he wasnt alive in the 1920s during the jazz age , but he appreciates all of those classics"
21233,i think jazz really speaks to the creative soul since it is so freeform . great jazz musicians say they never know how a piece will end when they are composing .
21234,which is crazy too me . jazz is so complex . tupac even went to the baltimore school of the arts to study it
21235,i think jazz has its fingers into a lot of musical pies so to speak . it is so neat how everyone thinks their own favorite music is unique but actually they all weave together .
21236,hi good morning . do you have any kids ? it seems like incredibles 2 would be a good movie to watch with them .
21237,i have three kids . i used to play the video game when i was younger . i remember it was called the incredibles : rise of the underminer .
21238,awesome . apparently 13 years before incredibles 2 came out there was a release in video game format !
21239,"hahaha . that kind of tells you my age . incredibles is a great movie , but i love comedy film . have you watch 3rd rock from the sun ?"
21240,nope never have . but i should since it won a golden globe back in '97 !
21241,"i love any kind of movies , specially a genre of movies called bromatic comedies ."
21242,"oh nice . me too actually . one of my favorite movies was pineapple express ! seth rogan and franco , so funny ."
21243,it was so impressed when i found out that that the first silent movies were comedies
21244,"yeah that is so funny , slapstick comedy is . i also like comedies because most traditionally have a happy ending . except for the black comedy variation ."
21245,did you know that there was a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes ?
21246,ha ha no i didn't know that but i always wonder what happened to the damage caused by the superheroes . surprisingly there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states .
21247,wow . i didn't know there were that many . i read something funny the other day about garfield and a book series named pet force . hahahaha
21248,garfield is a superhero ? one superhero that doesn't sound very interesting is normal man he doesn't have any powers .
21249,"hahahha . . . i am not sure , but i thought it was the cat ."
21250,yeah garfield the cat lol ! one thing i didn't know is that stanley wrote 15 dc comics . very surprising .
21251,i know . they kind of were reimagining popular superheroes like batman and superman .
21252,yes exactly . so cool the superhero has been around since 1930 !
21253,incredible ! but there are not too many female superheroes .
21254,"that is true . i am sure wonder woman gets lonely sometimes ! they have pet force , but now they need more woman superheroes . it was nice to talk with you today . have a good one !"
21255,you too . see you next time .
21256,"bye now : ,"
21257,hello have you seen the incredibles 2 ?
21258,"hello , i have not seen any of the series . is it good ?"
21259,yes very entertaining ! great extention to the story as well . i cant believe it took 13 years to make the sequel
21260,really ? why so long ?
21261,"i dont know , maybe too much to do . maybe it was actually drawn lol"
21262,haha thats possible
21263,the incredible movies are set in the 1960's
21264,"oh yeah ? that's cool , what other types of movies do you like ? how about comedy ?"
21265,"yeah love comedy , i hear ryan stiles dropped out of high school to pursue a career in comedy . hes great in that show whose line is it anyways ."
21266,"oh yeah , he surely makes me laugh !"
21267,have you ever watched 3rd rock from the sun ?
21268,"i love that show , i was excited when they won a golden globe award . i almost fainted ! !"
21269,"that is a good show , i kinda cant believe that it beat out seinfield and friends though lol"
21270,"well , the comedy gods were on their side haha"
21271,do you like ' bromantic comedies ' ?
21272,i do indeed like harold and kumar and the hangover ! !
21273,yeah those are great movies ! the hangover series especially lol
21274,"yeah , i prefer the harold and kumar series better theough especiallly when all they want to do is go to white castle haha"
21275,lol those little burgers are delicious .
21276,yeah they are they are little pieces of heaven in between two delectable buns .
21277,"its been great chatting , thanks for the convo !"
21278,hello . do you like star wars ?
21279,not as much as i used to . as a kid i loved it but those prequels soured me to the rest of it .
21280,i agree . the older movies are much better . it is a popular series though to a lot of people . star wars is the second highest grossing movie of all time .
21281,"i remember being very excited when the first prequel was released , i paid to see it at the big fancy theater in dc , the uptown"
21282,what is that theater like ?
21283,it's one of those big old theaters with just one big screen
21284,"cool . say , did you know that george lucas' wife worked on the movie ?"
21285,was it how they met or were they married at the time ? it's always funny that the producers had no faith in the movie before it came out .
21286,they were married at the time . she made some major changes like obi wan's death and such and won an academy award for editing .
21287,"good for her , still over shadowed by her husband though . with all the money they've made from the merchandising i'm sure she doesn't mind ."
21288,probably so . star wars holds the record for most successful film merchandising franchise .
21289,"my son loves the star wars music , he's learned to play all the music on piano ."
21290,that is really impressive . i used to have the album of the sound track from the original movie back in the day . those songs were fantastic !
21291,"i think i did too , not a hundred percent sure . my dad had jazz playing all the time at home , i think i wanted something i liked ."
21292,i like jazz . i'm not real familiar with all of the artists but i do like the music . i especially like the swing bands of the 1930s .
21293,"i think my dad turned me away from it , you know , the more someone tries to force it on you the less likely you are to move toward it ."
21294,"i know what you mean . my parents listened to a lot of country when i was a kid so i turned to rock and pop music . now though , i do like some country i have to admit . i think george strait is very good ."
21295,"that's another mystery to me . i've lived primarily in dc and country doesn't make much of an impression there . if anything i lie the older country , hank williams and that ."
21296,i guess henry ford may have failed then . he helped finance country music back in the day due to his fears of jazz music and it's urban decadence .
21297,"people are always fearful that the new thing will lead to the end of civilization . country is just folk music originally from europe , jazz is probably just folk music from a different source ."
21298,true . jazz comes from the blues and ragtime i think .
21299,have you been to the dc area before ?
21300,i have but it was a long time ago . it looks like there's always a lot of stuff going on there . they have a lot of different events at the convention center one of them is a convention called awesome con . it's like a comiccon with a lot of different people . it looks pretty cool
21301,"yeah i heard about the comiccon that sounds like a great thing to do , also the showcase with jenna camille , that is another must do thing on my list"
21302,that does sound good ! have you ever been to a comic con by the way ? also i would go see justin pack personally
21303,"i havent but maybe this year i can make it , one of the stands i would visit would be the star wars stand"
21304,i would check that out too ! george lucas is a genius to come up with that whole series of movies . although i must say i don't like the new ones myself .
21305,"i dont like the new ones either , i loved episode i and episode iii but rogue one was terrible"
21306,rogue one is horrible haha . i agree with you there . do you like james cameron ? he was apparently inspired by star wars
21307,"i do , i think his a great director and movies can inspire us to take different paths , thank god james cameron became a director thanks to the influence of star wars"
21308,i agree ! i really like his movie terminator and terminator 2 . what is really weird is that george lucas says r2d2 is telling the entire story of star wars . only he's telling it several hundred years in the future
21309,"thats a creative spin to the story , r2d2 is a badass , his my favorite robot so if anyone has to tell the story im glad its him and not a sith robot"
21310,"haha that's funny . what's funny to is that fox gave george lucas merchandising rights instead of the 500 , 000 for part of his directing fee . and that helps to make him a billionaire lol"
21311,"it is funny , they lost a lot of money there for sure , star wars is a really popular franchise so yeah , did you know that in 2013 star wars was dubbed in navajo ,"
21312,no i didn't know that ! i also didn't know that star wars holds the guinness world records title for ' most successful film merchandising franchise '
21313,"i guess lucas is really happy about that and fox is regretting it big time , maria lucas is really important as well , the success of the franchise is in great part due to her"
21314,i agree . she doesn't get enough credit ! do you like country music at all ?
21315,"no not really , do you like it ?"
21316,i can't say that i do . but i did not know that the fender stratocaster was intended originally for country music
21317,"i didnt know that either that is a great guitar , i love jazz better though , find it relaxing"
21318,yeah i think jazz is more relaxing . who do you listen to exactly when you listen to jazz ? i also never knew that dizzy gillespie ran for president lol
21319,"i dont have a favorite artist , and in a parallel universe he won for sure lol"
21320,do you like comedies ?
21321,"i do , i love it !"
21322,"me too , what are your favorites ?"
21323,i really like monty python . did you know that graham chapman was a medical doctor until he gave up his practice to concentrate on comedy ?
21324,"no , i didn't know that . what was he in ?"
21325,he was in monty python .
21326,"oh , i've never actually seen it . was it any good ?"
21327,"yes it's a funny comedy for it's time . it's funny , i'm studying computer programming and right now i'm learning the python programming language . it was named partly to honor the british comedy group monty python ."
21328,"interesting , i didn't know that . i have to use both python and java at my job . mostly python for the scikit library ."
21329,"that's awesome , i like learning it so far ."
21330,"yeah , it is pretty cool stuff , but repetitive ."
21331,i've caught that so far . do you like to watch comedy central ?
21332,"nah , they cancel way too many shows ."
21333,it's crazy that they've canceled over 100 shows in the last 30 years .
21334,"that is hilarious , but i can believe it . i think some shows are no good on that channel to be honest ."
21335,yeah they do . did you know that ' the green lantern ' was originally going to be a comedy starring jack black ?
21336,"no , i didn't know that . did you see it ?"
21337,"i have seen it , it was ok with ryan reynolds . i don't think it would have been too good with jack black ."
21338,"yeah , i can believe that he hasn't made a good movie in a long time . well , nice chatting !"
21339,"nice chatting with you too , i hope you have a great rest of your day !"
21340,you too !
21341,"hi , how are you ?"
21342,"i'm pretty good , how about yourself ? i'm dancing in my chair listening to imagine dragons , waiting for this work day to end ."
21343,nice . are you at work right now ?
21344,i am at work right now . waiting one more hour until i can go home .
21345,nice . i am in chicago and we got nailed with a storm so i am home with my kids on a snow day . do you dance a lot ?
21346,"gross , i hate snow . i live in south alabama . i dance mostly when nobody's watching . i don't have great rhythm ."
21347,you are not missing out . i had to shovel or snowblow for 2 hours today . we got 7 inches !
21348,i guess one good thing about the snow is no snakes . i don't know which one i'd hate the worst .
21349,snakes . the answer to what do i hate more is always snakes . . . i can't even watch them on tv .
21350,"i'm a wuss when it comes to the cold , i can always kill snakes , but you can't kill the cold . the fear of snakes is hardwired in our brains , so it's natural to be afraid of them ."
21351,"i guess it's regional becuase i can always put on more layers . i can't run away from snakes fast enough ! what do you do for a living , besides dance ?"
21352,"i'd like to imagine that i'm a professional dancer , but nobody seems to want to pay me money . in actuality i'm a biomedical equipment technician at a children's hospital ."
21353,nice . sounds fun . what's up with these flying snakes ? are those the most terrifying ?
21354,"that is crazy . i'd probably pass out if i saw one , then move to new zealand ."
21355,ha ! we can be roommates . what is a legless lizard ?
21356,"i'm down ! to me it would be a snake , i mean , isn't that what a snake is ? haha . there was a guy that told me that there was something like that in the area i live , but i have yet to see any ."
21357,"first i have to worry about snakes now legless lizard ? although if you think about legless things , like pigs , its a little funnier . . ."
21358,"legless pigs , legless dragons , can you imagine ? i think that could be a new song . i'll have to call up one of the dan's and see if i can write it for them ."
21359,i would at least listen to it on spotify !
21360,"those streaming numbers add up , it could be a dance hit ."
21361,ha ! nice chatting with you !
21362,do you watch comedy films ?
21363,"yeah , i do ! who is your favorite comedian ?"
21364,"billy murray for sure , demetri martin after , how about you ?"
21365,definitely demitri martin . did you know that he was accepted into harvard ?
21366,"i did not know that , he is probably a secret genius based on his stand up . have you seen kung fu hustle ?"
21367,"i have , actually ! i think it's hilarious . you ?"
21368,"i have not , bill murray said it was comedy gold , would you agree ?"
21369,"oh yeah , for sure . speaking of comedy gold , do you like seinfeld , friends , or frasier ?"
21370,"i was a seinfeld person , i actually just watched friends last year for the first time and it was good . i really liked 3rd rock from the sun back in the day , ever seen it ?"
21371,yeah ! i guess 3rd rock from the sun won a golden globe over all three of those series in 1997 . amazing !
21372,that is crazy to think about . i used to watch it and never understood what it was about
21373,"haha i know , right ? do you ever watch the golden globes ? i'd love to attend one someday . there's amazing fashion there ."
21374,"for sure , that would be awesome , i don't know what i would wear , what do you think ?"
21375,"hmm , not sure . but just make sure that your clothes are tailored . i guess fashionites look for collar gaps to make sure that they're high quality !"
21376,for sure ! i would wear clothes from apple's clothing line from 1986 and really stand out
21377,"yeah ! unfortunately , there's probably nothing left from them . if you really want to stand out , there's a store in alabama that sells clothes from unclaimed baggage at airports . . ."
21378,"for sure , what a great business . pure profit basically !"
21379,"yeah . speaking of money and fashion , i guess keanu reeves gave 80 million of his matix salary to special effects and makeup staff ."
21380,"what a good guy , i did not know that ! good chatting with you !"
21381,good chatting with you too . have fun with watching your comedy shows .
21382,you too !
21383,do you like soccer ?
21384,"if you are talking about fifa , then yes ."
21385,"when was the last time the us held the world cup ? i wonder , but there are no economic gains for countries that host olympics or the world cup ."
21386,i'm not sure . i know they got 3rd place in the first fifa world cup in 1930 .
21387,that's neat . the american women's soccer team seems to fare better in modern times . they haven't placed below third since 1991 in the world cup .
21388,"what great talent ! did you know that soccer makes more money than football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis and hockey combined ?"
21389,"i did not know that ! americans have to get more into it ! i wonder if they would be more into it if they watched the version where three teams face each other at the same time . probably not , would be very confusing ."
21390,i think you're right . the world cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world .
21391,it's the world's most popular sport too !
21392,"yes , i've heard it exceeds the olympic games in viewership ."
21393,and americans are the only ones who call it soccer because it was slang for association football .
21394,"oh , interesting . did you know that the city set to host the 2022 qatar fifa world cup does not yet exist ?"
21395,that is interesting . you know jon stewart ? he used to be a soccer player in college and represented the us at the pan american maccabi games in brazil .
21396,that is really cool . a multi talented guy from the sounds of it .
21397,"yeah . mesuit ozil is another talented one and he donated his eur 300 , 000 world cup victory bonus to pay for surgeries for 23 children in brazil ."
21398,that is great to hear . did you know there are no economic gains for the countries that have played host to the olympics or the world cup ?
21399,"yes , i've heard that . but maybe it helps some places for future tourism ?"
21400,i would think so . especially since soccer makes more money than all other sports combined .
21401,well maybe florida born shaq moore will help more americans to be interested in soccer . he plays in la liga .
21402,sounds like he is the shaq of soccer !
21403,exactly ! he was playing for smaller spanish teams but now then played for la liga . he was invited to a u . s . national team because of that .
21404,do you enjoy sports ?
21405,sure . lately i've been into association footbal and wrestling . how about you ?
21406,"i also like soccer . i was surprised that on a global scale , it is the world's most popular sport"
21407,"yeah , isn't that wild ? in the usa , nfl seems to overshadow soccer , but the biggest difference i see is that nfl is a lot of waiting around , while soccer is a lot of running around ."
21408,"well the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of gameplay , while in soccer , they run an average 7 miles per game ."
21409,nice ! all the actions helps me to burn calories just watching ! have you seen the version of the game where 3 teams play at the same time
21410,"i heard about it and i think it must be chaotic , but in a good way . i would love to see it"
21411,"me too ! i wish soccer was more popular in the states . there are a few wellknown people that are into the game though . did you know the comedian , jon stewart , was a soccer player that competed on the world level ?"
21412,i didn't . i mean soccer is both popular and has influence since it makes more money than most other popular sports combined
21413,"that must be at the world level , like team competing toward the world cup , right ?"
21414,"probably . one german player got 300k euros for a world cup victory bonus , but instead he donated it to pay for the surgeries of 23 children in brazil"
21415,that's awesome ! wouldn't it ne great if one of those kids grew up to be a world cup athlete ? i wish the world cup finals were held annually instead of every four years .
21416,well the next world cup is set to be hosted by qatar in 2022
21417,i heard about that . aren't they building a new city for that event ?
21418,"yes the city doesn't yet exist . there are no net economic gains for hosting countries , but i wonder if they benefit from prestige or tourism to warrant them to build and entirely new city ."
21419,"yeah , and what will happen to the city after the masses depart ? do you think the usa has a chance to win ? the us got third place in the first fifa cup ."
21420,"while soccer isn't us's most popular sport , they have a good chance given their strong track record of never being below 3rd place since 1991"
21421,"you know , back in the 50s , the hungarian team won all but 1 game over a six year period . six years ! that's insane !"
21422,they must have been having an amazing year . i wonder how they did at the last world cup .
21423,"good question . hey , you ever attended a real wrestling match ? i wrestled in hs , and i can remember the first time a fellow classmate asked , ' where are the ropes ? '"
21424,"i have not , but i have seen a lot of wrestling moves in mixed marital arts in a cage"
21425,"yeah , that's brutal stuff . hard for a person to survive for long in that sport . you know abe lincoln was a wrestler ? quite good too ! he only lost one match in a career that lasted over 300 matches !"
21426,i didn't know that . i do know that wrestling has a long and distinguished history with even plato leading a professional wrestling career before he became famous a philosopher
21427,"that's a far cry from today's professional wrestlers , like the macho man , who wears bizarre outfits ."
21428,"in any case , thank you for the enlightening chat about wrestling . have a nice day ."
21429,"hi , how are you doing over there ? you good ?"
21430,i'm pretty good . do you watch soccer ?
21431,"i try to watch the world cup . other than that , not much . how about you ?"
21432,"not really , but i used to play soccer games on the playstation ."
21433,really . were they any good ? did it feel like soccer ?
21434,"it was pretty good , but i was never all that good at it . new zealand was the only defeated team at the 2010 world cup ."
21435,new zealand ? i thought they only did rugby . the wc seems to be a bit of scam though . there are no net economic gains for countries that have played host to the world cup
21436,yeah me too . btw japans bidding for the fifa world cup in 2022 .
21437,"they are getting the olympics in 2020 , which is going to be quite expensive . i don't think they'll make money , but will get a lot of attention . i thought qatar had the cup for 2022 ."
21438,"wow , i wonder what they think of football over there ?"
21439,they probably follow the teams in europe . premier league . champions league . the money that soccer generates is amazing .
21440,"yeah , i would think so . the average soccer player runs 7 miles per game ."
21441,they must lose a ton of water weight .
21442,"yeah , i'm not sure how much . apparently greenland can't join fifa because there is not enough grass for a soccer field ."
21443,"well , that's unfair . the place is called greenland , yet they do not have grass . maybe they should place a variant called ice soccer or something ."
21444,it's pretty funny . did you watch wrestling ?
21445,not really much of wrestling fan . do you ?
21446,"well , i like macho man . he was signed to play baseball at one point ."
21447,what position ? he must be a pretty big guy .
21448,i'm not sure . did you know neil degrasse was an undefeated wrestler in high school ?
21449,i wonder how he would have done at oil wrestling .
21450,hilarious . well nice chatting with you .
21451,do you happen to enjoy comedy ? i watch a lot of comedy movies and standup .
21452,i do like comedy . i really like comedy tv shows . i was pretty happy when 3rd rock from the sun won best comedy series back in 1997 .
21453,i'm surprised it won then . it had to have been up against seinfeld .
21454,it was . it was up against them and friends and frasier . all of which are among the greats of comedy and it still won .
21455,wow ! that's some stiff competition . are you familiar with demetri martin ?
21456,the name isn't ringing a bell right away . is he or she an actor in comedy ?
21457,he's a standup comedian . he had his own show on comedy central for maybe two seasons .
21458,that sounds cool . i guess he is pretty funny then . what kind of stand up does he do ?
21459,it's a lot of wordplay usually . he was accepted into harvard law but left to pursue comedy because he was bored .
21460,"wow , i'm not sure what to say to that lol ! he was bored at harvard law ? i suppose law could be boring if you would rather be a comedian ."
21461,his comedy is pretty smart and he's been successful so i guess it worked out for him . do you know ryan stiles ?
21462,i'm feeling pretty out of touch right now because i have to say no . for some reason i think he may be an actor . the name sounds a little familiar .
21463,it's been a while since i've seen him . he was a tall thin guy on whose line is it anyway back when that was on .
21464,"oh , i think i know who you are talking about . seems like maybe i've seen him as a guest on other shows like the middle ."
21465,probably . he dropped out of high school to pursue comedy . i'm sensing a trend with comedians .
21466,it does seem like there is one ! i'm old school . do you know who bill murray is ?
21467,i love bill murray .
21468,i do too . i'm not sure if he's a drop out but i do know that he says that kung fu hustle is the supreme achievement in comedy of this day and age .
21469,while i do love him i'm going to have to disagree with him on that one . have you heard of the term bromantic comedy ?
21470,i think i have to disagree too ! i've heard the term bromance but i don't think i've heard it describe comedy . why ?
21471,it's a fairly new term they are using to describe movies like pineapple express or i love you man .
21472,hello how are you doing today ?
21473,"i'm doing alright , up bright and early with some coffee , watching a comedy movie to start my day . how about you ?"
21474,that's good . i'm doing great myself . did you know kim jongil statue in team america is actually a real person in makeup ?
21475,"is it really ? haha the only real person in that movie i think , arent they all puppets ?"
21476,haha yea i think so . i've never actually seen the move .
21477,"neither have i , though i bet its great . i'm more of a kung fu hustle kind of guy . like bill murray , i will vouch for that movie forever"
21478,that's good i like those types of movies too . did you know michael chiklis went bald at age 20 because of a mishap with theater makeup ?
21479,"oh my god i cant iamgine , thats awful ! did he sue you think ?"
21480,that would stink . i'm not sure if he sued or not .
21481,"i would , i need to hold to what little hair ieft !"
21482,haha yea my hairline is starting to recede myself .
21483,did you know that the pictures we always see of pilgrims is actually kind nonrepresentative of their style ? they often wore a lot of color
21484,oh wow i didn't know that . i saw that ryan stiles dropped out of high school to pursue a career in comdedy .
21485,"and im happy he did ! sorta . i mean its important to finish your education but if he didnt drop out , we would have never have seen him on whose line"
21486,i agree . 3rd rock from the sun won the golden globe for best comedy series back in 1997 .
21487,and it beat seinfeld ! which i like a lot more . do you like 3rd rock ?
21488,"i never really watched 3rd rock , but i really liked seinfeld ."
21489,"same , i even like friends a lot more than 3rd rock ! im surprised"
21490,did you know rip curl makes clothes in north korea but label says made in china ?
21491,i wonder why . do you think its some sort of legal issue ?
21492,not too sure on that . it was great talking to you !
21493,"cosmetics obviously can be used to enhance or alter appearance , but the use to change one's fragrance is a little more subtle category of cosmetics ."
21494,that's true . people often think of cosmetics as being associated with appearance but few think directly of improving your own sent .
21495,"it can also be natural products . for instance , coconut oil is a great moisturizer and it smells nice also ."
21496,"that is true , thou you need to be careful with it . did you hear how a mistake with theater makeup made michael chiklis bald when he was only 20 ? that stuff can be dangerous ."
21497,yes . my dad read a story from a newspaper once about the autopsy of a man who died from hair dye being absorbed into his skin . even the aluminum in most deodorants has some danger .
21498,"yeah that sounds like a nightmare . there's also plenty of stuff people use every day that they don't even think of as cosmetics like shampoo and hair gel , but that's what they are . interesting how we think of different products ."
21499,"true . i was in the grocery store yesterday morning and ran into alice cooper , he lives here in phoenix , . he had on makeup , his signature eye shadow and mascara even a 9 am ."
21500,"really ? interesting that you run into a celebrity in a grocery store but hey they gotta eat too , right ? i hear celebrities rely a lot on cosmetics , i heard keanu reeves gave most of his salary money from the matrix to the people who did his make up ."
21501,"that movie relied on a lot of makeup and special effects . that was generous of him . i guess one would consider those costumes as a type of clothing . you know , every human society wears clothing of some kind ."
21502,"yeah , kinda strange that even societies that developed in very warm climates still wear clothes . did you know that apple had a clothing line once ? they should try that again , i bet apple's fans would rush to stores to buy apple shirts , haha ."
21503,"apple used to be niche brand so the clothing probably was a great promotional tool . in the early days apple users were sort of snobbish about it . now branding on the outside of clothing is commonplace . of course , some clothing is gender specific but those lines get blurry nowadays ."
21504,"yeah that's true they make clothing out of all kinds of things like textiles , thin sheets of materials , and animal skin , though that last one has fallen in popularity in recent years ."
21505,"that is sure true . however , no one complains about leather shoes or belts . really stylish people can tell if your clothes look tailored by looking for collar gaps ."
21506,"yeah , that is strange that those haven't been complained about yet . something for the next generation , perhaps . all the tricks to make cheaper clothing look more stylish will generally only fool people who don't care about looking stylish . pretty ironic ."
21507,good point . wearing clothing is mostly restricted to humans . the only cases that i can think of that are not is when some animal is dressed by a human like some people do for their dogs . it is odd that no other animal dresses itself .
21508,"yeah , you'd think other animals would try clothing , especially those native to colder climates . but at least animals don't have to worry about the various social rules for what to wear and when . those can get very complex ."
21509,yes and one can embarrass him or herself if one violates those rules . i wish i had dressed by child as a pilgrim wearing a red and black checked flannel shirt and told him to tell the audience at the play that this is how we dress on weekdays .
21510,"yeah , miss one or two obscure norms about clothing and you're comedy film material ! you know , comedies have been made since the silent film era , pretty impressive . i guess you don't need sound to be funny ."
21511,yes . but they were heavy into slapstick which stops being funny when the audience matures .
21512,"yeah , when movies were new slapstick was enough to entertain everybody . but as time went on people needed more and more to get a laugh . that's why i wouldn't drop out of school for a job on comedy , no matter how well it worked out for ryan stiles ."
21513,ha ha . one's odds of financial success doing that are pretty low . nice chatting !
21514,do you like colorful clothing ?
21515,"yes i do . miguel cabarello who makes bulletproof clothing , has his employees wear them and get shot to test the clothing"
21516,wow that is scary . pilgrims wear black clothing only on special occasions
21517,nice . greeks made asbestos clothing and it was worth a lot
21518,wow . do you know how fashion people can tell if you need your clothes tailored
21519,"hmm i have no idea , they take measurements"
21520,nope they actually look for collar gaps in your clothes
21521,nice . a guy once wore 70 pieces of clothing so he was not charged the fee at the airport
21522,haha that is funny . did you know apple had a clothing line back in 1986
21523,wow cool . do you know what the fly on the pants is ?
21524,"hmm i am not sure , the zipper ? a guy once sued a company because they lost his pants"
21525,it is actually the cloth flap over it . how much did he sue for ?
21526,he sued them for 67 million
21527,wow crazy . women were allowed to wear pants in senate only after 1993
21528,wow that is late in collinsvile saggy pants are prohibited
21529,"i like that rule . in paris there was a 200 year ban on women wearing pants , until 2013"
21530,wow that is late . do you like birds ?
21531,i do . do you know why they fly in a v formation ?
21532,"hmm i am not sure , why is that actually ?"
21533,because it reduces drag by 65 percent and increases range by 71 percent
21534,yeah . have you heard of the dodo bird ?
21535,the movie black panther is rated as a good movie for children . thats interesting !
21536,"my kids are pretty little , so i wouldn't let them watch it , but maybe 1012 year olds would be okay . i loved the girl power portrayed in black panther !"
21537,i agree . 1012 would be more appropriate . there are a few ' s ' words nothing too extreme ! !
21538,"it seems like movies can be pretty racy these days , it's hard to find something that the whole family can enjoy . i haven't seen early man , but my sisterinlaw said it was good for all her kids to see"
21539,hmmm . i haven't seen early man . . . i'll have to check it out ! ! ! the thing i like about black panther is the emphasis on teamwork . . . and the girl power that you mentioned is shown with the acknowledgement of female athletes ! ! !
21540,"yes ! it's pretty unexplored in the superhero universes , it's refreshing to see women with such important roles"
21541,absolutely ! ! early man seems like it would be interesting . . . its a fun look at prehistoric times ! ! children always like that type of entertainment ! !
21542,"i'm not a huge fan of stopmotion , but early man was created by the same guy who made wallace and gromit , so at least he knows what he's good at"
21543,i think what made black panther interesting is that it focused on the first superheros of color ! ! ! something different ! !
21544,"totally ! i think the cast was fantastic , especially michael b . jordan"
21545,"yesss ! ! lupita nyong'o , angela bassett , forest whitaker , danai gurira and daniel kaluuya all added special touches to the movie . . . . helping to bring the story alive ! !"
21546,"i read that chadwick boseman needed money to study at a summer theater program at oxford but didn't have the money , but then an private benefactor paid for him to go . the private benefactor was denzel washington !"
21547,wow ! ! ! that's pretty impressive ! ! i am a big fan of denzel washington . . . i had no idea that he acted as a private benefactor and paid for someone else to study ! ! that's pretty amazing !
21548,"i know ! i love when people with talent , and money , can help and support others"
21549,absolutely ! ! ! i think that the black panther movie is something that families will talk about together after watching the movie . . . race . . . gender . . . . team work . . . all these are portrayed in the movie ! ! ! all positive content ! !
21550,"my only beef with black panther is that it's long , like over two hours ! i feel like superhero movies are getting super long , i have a hard time following along sometimes"
21551,lol . . . it was pretty long . . . but exciting nonetheless . the richest superhero is black panther . . . . he 's worth over 500 billion ! ! bruce wayne was only worth 80 billion ! ! ! what a difference ! !
21552,"i feel like the money was talked about a lot in the iron man movies , but i didn't hear it so much in black panther"
21553,i was surprised to find out that black panther had nothing to do with the black panther activists ! ! ! i think a lot of people thought so ! !
21554,"yeah , it can be hard to differentiate , but they are so different"
21555,yes ! ! ! there are over 300 known superheros in the u . s . and black panther has taken the lead spot ! ! excellent movie and great for the whole family ! ! it has been a pleasure talking to you . have a great day !
21556,"thanks , you too !"
21557,how are you ? are you interested in fashion at all ? bottega veneta makes really nice leather handbags
21558,"i like to look at some of it , but something like new york fashion week would be beyond me ."
21559,"yea , i haven't heard much about bottega veneta but they don't like putting company logos or initials on their products which is kind of refreshing"
21560,"yes , i do like that . although then what is the point of getting designer stuff . apparently tom ford's new collection was tawdry and vulgar . oh dear ."
21561,if tom ford's items are considered tawdry and vulgar i might have to check them out lol
21562,"hah . and did you know that apple had a clothing line in 1986 . they should have kept that up , people would totally buy that nowadays"
21563,"no i never knew apple had a clothing line , i figure that would be the antithesis of versace or gucci or dolce instead of botega veneta"
21564,i thought it was interesting that pilgrim clothing was full of color and the only wore black for special occasions . i'm used to seeing them only in black in illustrations
21565,"yea that is interesting , so is checking collar gaps to see if you clothes are tailored , i've never thought of that"
21566,yeah i'm not that picky or observant . i suppose if you're in the industry though its important
21567,"yea but the industry can be shady , like rip curl making clothing in north korea but puting made in china on the label"
21568,"sure , but there should be more stores like the one in alabama that sell stuff from unclaimed baggage . then maybe people could get their stuff back"
21569,i wonder how they are legally able to do that ? they better not sell any of stuff from the d . c . judge that sued a dry cleaning business for 67 million
21570,"i think they have set more limits on the amounts people can sue for , which is a good think . i'm glad things have changed since roman times , when wearing pants was a sign of barbarism"
21571,i wonder what the romans wore while riding horses since pants were invented to help ride horses
21572,"yes , i wonder when pants were actually invented , but it must have been uncomfortable wearing a skirt and riding a horse ."
21573,i wonder if they ever made pants with dodo birtds before they became exting
21574,"how funny that aladdin's pants were modeled after mc hammer . i didn't know that , but i can totally see it"
21575,yea alladin's pants do look like mc hammer's parachute pants
21576,and some birds fly from alaska to mexico without sleeping during migration . that is crazy poor birds
21577,"yea that is crazy . well i got to go , nice talking with you"
21578,do you have a favorite pair of clothes
21579,yes i do ! i love to wear nice shirts . did you know that apple had a clothing line in 1986 ?
21580,"i did not know , i wish i could wear a shirt made by apple by then , do you have any ?"
21581,i don't have any . i wonder if they're worth money now as collectibles ? there is a store in alabama that only sells clothes and other items that would found in unclaimed baggage airports . bet they have found some nice clothes and items to sell .
21582,"i bet they are worth something . i want to start a clothing store here in iowa with stuff from unclaimed baggage , pure profit !"
21583,nice ! rip curl makes clothes in north korea yet the label says made in china .
21584,"for sure , i should make clothes in north korea i am sure its super cheap !"
21585,lol i didn't realize pilgrims wore clothes that were full of color . i always thought of them wearing black and white .
21586,"i did not know that , we were taught so wrong in elementary school !"
21587,yes ! lol did you know that what we call pants in america they call trousers in britain ?
21588,"i did not know that , trousers is such a weird word !"
21589,"yes it is . lol sounds old fashioned . collinsville , il has a law that prohibits saggy pants . lolol"
21590,ha that law should be everywhere . romans saw pants as a sign of barbarism lol
21591,lol yes ! i wonder why they thought that ? lol aladdin's pants were modeled after mc hammer . hahahahaha i never noticed that .
21592,"lol did not know that , i am into birds , how about you"
21593,i like watching them . i some birds fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when they migrate . that's incredible .
21594,birds are amazing . their bones are so hollow
21595,that's probably what allows them to fly so easily because thier entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers .
21596,"i would love to fly so much , good chatting with you !"
21597,me too . fly and be like a hummingbird and steal spiderwebs to build my nest . lol have a good one !
21598,"you too , bye !"
21599,do you like birds ?
21600,i do like birds ! how about you ? know anything interesting about them ?
21601,"i do actually , do you know hummingbirds ? i know a really interesting fact about them"
21602,i know that they steal spiderwebs to make their nests . did you know that the extinct dodo bird is actually a sub family of the pigeon ?
21603,"you stole the cool fact out of me , that makes me sad , and i didnt know that , thats interesting , they dont really look alike"
21604,i know . how do they know that though ? lol i find it amazing that some birds can fly from alaska to northern mexicao without sleeping while migrating .
21605,"that is amazing , some birds can also mimic the sound of chainsaws , cameras and car alarms so amazing species"
21606,that would be kind of creepy to hear . in most birds their bones are so hollow that their entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers .
21607,"that makes sense , birds need to be light in order to fly , heavy bones can really be a problem"
21608,yes ! are you a fan of clothing ? i am and always seem to have it on . lol
21609,"i am a fan of fashin yeah , did you know apple had a clothing line back in the year 1986"
21610,i had no idea ! wonder how they decided to try getting into fashion ? that's funny .
21611,it is funny and i wonder why they dont have the clothing line anymore i would like to shop there
21612,good question . i bet it's worth some big bucks now . did you know that pilgrims clothing was full of color ? i never knew . . . .
21613,"no i always pictured them in a black and white way , interesting to learn that though"
21614,same here . have you ever heard of rip curl clothes ?
21615,funny how their labels says made in china and their clothes are actually made in north korea
21616,yes ! seems kind of dishonest . did you know the british version for pants is trousers ? lol
21617,funny fact about pants but a d . c judge once filled a multimillion lawsuit because a dry cleaner lost his pants
21618,yikes . they must have been his favorite pair . lol aladdin's pants were modeled after mc hammer . lol
21619,"thats funny lol , weird design but they do look alike ,"
21620,i know lol i have to get going . it was nice chatting with you today !
21621,"it was nice chatting with you as well , nice facts , interesting concersation have a nice day ."
21622,"how's it going , have you've seen black panther about an african prince turned king ?"
21623,"no , i haven't yet ! i want to see it . have you ?"
21624,"yea , black panther was a pretty good movie , chadwick boseman did a great job at t'challa"
21625,"yes , i heard the black panther is the richest superhero !"
21626,"yea , in the comics black panther is valued at 500 billion and worth than tony stark and bruce wayne"
21627,that's interesting ! is it true they were going to change the name to black leopard ?
21628,"i don't know , it's possible since they didn't want any association with the black panther party"
21629,did you know denzel washington did chadwick boseman a special favor ?
21630,"i heard washington paid for boseman's summer theater program at oxford university , thats awesome"
21631,yes and got to thank him 20 years later ! very cool ! !
21632,it's really cool the symbols and writing in black panther is based on the nsibdi script
21633,i'm not aware of what that script is ? do you ? its interesting that the movie was produced by marvel and distributed by walt disney studios .
21634,it's a script that originated near present day nigeria
21635,"oh really , do you have any other superheros that you like ? i like wonderwoman and catwoman ! lol"
21636,i like the punisher . it's crazy theres a hero called normalman who has no superpowers
21637,"lol , that's the perfect name for him . i think there is a superhero with a hearing aid too !"
21638,that's pretty cool . did you know stan lee has written for dc comics
21639,"no i didn't know that . that's interesting . i love garfield , do you know if they have made a movie with pet force superheros in it ?"
21640,"yea , i remember reading the pet force books when i was a kid"
21641,"only comics , no movie yet ? garfield must be a great superhero with his disposition !"
21642,"yea , i enjoyed them , well have a good night"
21643,have you seen the black panther movie ?
21644,i have seen it and all the marvel movies they're awesome . have you ?
21645,i did
21646,what do you think of them ? i like chadwick as black panther .
21647,i just recently watched it . i thought he was really good . did you know that the black panther is the richest superhero ? he is worth an estimated 500 billion dollars !
21648,yeah and bruce wayne is worth a lot less . hard to believe it just came out last year .
21649,i know . seems like longer than that . did you know that they almost changed the name to black leopard because they didn't want people to confuse it with the black panther group ?
21650,"wow i can see that , i'm glad they didn't though . did you know denzel washington was chadwick's private benefactor ?"
21651,i didn't know that . what did he do for him ?
21652,"well chadwick was accepted to a prestigious summer theater program at oxford university but could not afford it , so washington stepped in . chadwick thanked him 20 years later at the premier of black panther ."
21653,wow ! what are the odds of that . what a neat story !
21654,can you imagine jack black as the green lantern ?
21655,i kind of have a feeling i would have liked that movie more .
21656,"i can't see him in that role but i guess if it was going to be a comedy it would have been very good , i like black ."
21657,he's funny for sure . have you ever heard of demetri martin ? i'm not familiar with him .
21658,"i think that's the guy that wrote something or another , i can't really remember . have you heard of the book called becoming batman ?"
21659,"ok . i was reading that he was accepted into harvard law , but left out of boredom to pursue a comedy career . i haven't heard of that book ."
21660,no no you're right i got him confused with another guy . wow i hope it worked out for him because i don't know if i've seen any of his stand up's . have you ?
21661,i never heard of him before just now . lol ryan stiles also dropped out of high school to pursue a career in comedy . i know who he is . lol
21662,"is he funny , i may have seen them both . i'm just more familiar with faces than names . do you know what the most expensive comedy ever made was ?"
21663,hmmm . . . . that i don't know . what was it ?
21664,"evan almighty , did you see it ? i saw parts of but i think i liked bruce almighty better"
21665,i did see that movie ! i liked them both . i have to get going . it's been fun chatting with you !
21666,i love clothes . did you know that apple had a clothing line in 1986 ?
21667,so do i but i did not know that about apple . so cool ! i'm interested in what it was like since apple is so innovative at most things .
21668,"yes they are . there is also a store that only sells clothes , cameras , etc found in unclaimed baggage at airports"
21669,"now that i would want to check out . i bet you can find all sort of interesting items . in a chinese airport , a man wore 70 items of clothing to avoid the baggage charge . lol"
21670,lol that is something . well rip curl makes clothes in north korea yet the label says made in china
21671,hmm i don't like falsehoods like that . be brave like the greeks who literally made asbestos clothing and it was almost as valuable as gold ! ok . . . . .
21672,"wow . did you know in collinsville , il has a law that prohibits ' saggy pants . ' ?"
21673,i kinda like that law . did you know that miguel cabarello makes bulletproof clothing and tests them on his employees ? i wouldn't wanna work there !
21674,me either that sounds scary . people started wearing pants because of horses . mounted armies wearing pants were more effective than those wearing robes
21675,makes sense . so trousers and pants are the same in british and american english but in the uk pants usually means underwear and not trousers or pants . ? ?
21676,"good question . i do know that tailored shorts may be called ' short trousers ' , especially in the uk ."
21677,so many inconsistencies it seems but i guess as long as they know what it means . i want indestructible pants like the hulk .
21678,i use to wear aladdin's pants after mc hammer .
21679,nice ! it was illegal for women to wear pants in paris until 2013 . say what ? so unfair . it was like that for 200 years .
21680,"i could not live there at all . all i wear is pants for work . listen to this , a d . c . judge sued a small dry cleaning business for over 67 million for the loss of a pair of pants ."
21681,"yeah me either . that is crazy . must have been some pair of pant , maybe hulk's , lol ."
21682,rotf do you like birds ?
21683,"i like birds that stay away from me . i live near the beach and there have been many times birds have tried to attack me for my snacks . : , crazy aves aka birds ."
21684,"lo did you know in most birds , bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers"
21685,"wow , that's interesting . birds without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds . i have never heard of either of them ."
21686,hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests . that is something to know as well . you are amazing . good night
21687,do you like birds ?
21688,"yes , i like to eat them ! lol . i guess they are ok as pets . you ?"
21689,"yes , but not as pets , i have a bird feeder to observe wild birds ."
21690,"hey , that sounds great ! so what kinds of birds come around ?"
21691,"a lot , the most spectacular are the hummingbirds they are so tiny ."
21692,they are beautiful little things . i like to see them flit around . hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests . they are cunning .
21693,"it sound dangerous , they could get caught in it and be eaten by the spider ."
21694,i guess ! lol some birds fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when migrating . how do they go without sleep ? i want to know their secret .
21695,maybe they are just gliding in the wind and they sleep lightly doing it . like when people sleep when they drive . except it is not deadly .
21696,"oh , i see . well they don't have phones to distract them . that's good . people can be real dodos behind the wheel ."
21697,"dodo became extinct without sleeping at the wheel , funny to think they are related to pigeons , which are not extinct ."
21698,"pigeons are not terribly smart . but they breed prolifically . they cannot make interesting sounds . there are wild birds in australia that can mimic the sound of cameras , car alarms , and chainsaws ."
21699,that would drive me crazy . especially if they started to make phone sounds . but waking up to chainsaw sounds is also terrible .
21700,"now that's a horror movie . changing the subject , what kind of trousers do you like ?"
21701,"i like jeans , romans would not like them , they probably judge them as barbaric ."
21702,"i guess they looked simple and poor , unrefined . hard to ride horses with them , i guess ."
21703,i think it would be tougher to ride a horse in a roman toga . but i never tired it .
21704,i guess the romans would have shunned pants even though it were harder . fashion is more important .
21705,"fashion is important , that's why aladin's pants are like those of mc hammer's , and not disco pants ."
21706,"i thought mc hammer modeled his pants on aladdin's , actually ! lol . oh well . collinsville , il has a law that prohibits ' saggy pants . ' i understand ."
21707,"maybe it is a agricultural town , they would a a safety issue on a farm , and a sanitation issue in a slaughter house ."
21708,"yes , that's true . i think it's a terrible look . not really cool . anyway , great chat !"
21709,"you too , have a great day ."
21710,"hello , what are your thoughts on tesla inc ?"
21711,"i think telsa cars are pretty cool and innovative , i'd love to have a model s"
21712,"i would like to have one of those too , an s , x or a model 3 all seem like great cars"
21713,"i never knew the telsa model s runs on linux , i wonder how hard it would be to hack into"
21714,"it must be really hard , i heard that software is really sequre , the s is road tested at an indoor track ,"
21715,"that's pretty cool , i guess since tesla doesn't emit emissions they are able to test them indoors safely"
21716,"thats actually really responsible with the environment , i think elon musk is a really smart man , he sacrifices a lot of money for the company"
21717,"yea , musk must be super rich to take a 78 million paycut to his tesla salary"
21718,"he must be taking a paycut like that one , i didnt know toyota owned a part of tesla"
21719,"me neither , i also had no clue tesla help develop the rav 4 ev"
21720,"elon mysk also founded paypal and spacex ,"
21721,"i knew musk founded space x but didn't know he also founded paypal , he must be worth billions for paypal alone"
21722,"yeah and also tesla motors , all 3 of them must be worth a lot of money kind of like netflix , a service with 137 million subscribers"
21723,"it's crazy how big netflix has grown since being founded in 1997 , now it is available worldwide"
21724,"it is crazy , i bet reed hashtings and marc randolph didnt had such a big proyect in mind , its now a giant of the industry"
21725,yea i bet reed hastings couldn't of imagine how big his idea would be after being inspired by 40 late fees on his apollo 13 rental
21726,"i can relate to him i got a fine like that one once , i got so angry , its a good thing he started teh service"
21727,"yea , it's crazy netflix still mails out movie , they spend 20x on postage as they do on bandwidth"
21728,"it is crazy , i cant believe they still have a rental service , aybe they will eliminate that one soon"
21729,"it's shocking that blockbuster declined to buy netflix for 50 million several times , they refused to get with the ties"
21730,"they did ? i bet they regret that decision , anyways its been great chatting with you , hope we can do this again"
21731,"you too , have a great day"
21732,"hi , how do you like tesla ?"
21733,"i've never driven or ridden in one , but i have to admit that they're pretty sleek cars"
21734,"neither have i , and you know , i did not know they were related to toyota , who owns 10 percent of tesla"
21735,"tesla helped develop the 2nd generation rav4ev , which i have ridden in before . i'm more familiar with toyota cars"
21736,i found really cool they could test one of the models indoors because does not produce any emissions !
21737,isn't that the model s ? that would also mean that it can be parked inside a closed garage
21738,"and it would not do any harm ! i think the founder , elon musk did a great design there !"
21739,"well , he also founded paypal and spacex , so he definitely knows what he's doing !"
21740,"he has been involved with online banking , aerospace manufacturers , ai technologies , neurological technologies among other things ! !"
21741,i wonder what made him choose to use linux in the model s . there must be a good reason for that
21742,"he is not conventional , for example he took a large paycut on his tesla salary , out of 78 million he returned everything except for 1"
21743,"but i'm sure it was worth it , whatever the reason . he seems like the kind of guy who takes big risks for something he thinks will pay off in the future"
21744,he is not tied to the conventional . i would like to see the vertical takeoff electrical pasenger jet he wants to build
21745,"not just that , but i wonder what his longterm plan is when it comes to mars colonization . a heavy lift rocket would be nice , but there's a lot more that would need to be invented for that type of colonization"
21746,it looks like he is seriously thinking about that . i would want to stay on earth definetely
21747,"oh , definitely ! i don't know what his wife looks like , but she was in the movie inception"
21748,"i remember her and the movie as well , it is amazing . it looks like he acted too in ' thank you for smoking ' , i have not seen that one"
21749,"i've never heard of that one , but i'm surprised that someone who is that much into not having emissions would be in something with that title"
21750,"he even have time for boring stuff , he founded the boring company !"
21751,does he even sleep ? he has all the energy to pursue all these different ideas
21752,it was nice talking to you ! good bye
21753,how's it going ? do you keep up with the world cup ? palolo guerreo scored the game wining goal for peru against new zealand
21754,"i'd love to go to peru . not to see the fifa world cup , but to see the land . america always does good in the world cup , i think ."
21755,"i know france typically does well in the world cup , i think they won the most recent one"
21756,i hear they've held the fifa world cup in russia . i wonder if it was snowing when they were playing . seems chess might be a more reasonable game . . . or hockey !
21757,"seems that way , i wonder how taipa would play in russia after playing in orlando city"
21758,you mean at the football game he might feel the effects of changing climate and jet lag and all that ?
21759,"yea , i wonder how all the teams from places like costa rica and the middle east will fare"
21760,i've heard elevation really can make a difference in how sports players get on . i wonder if the association for football will ever get involved to be sure players can be ok ? maybe they do already ?
21761,i don't know but they should . i heard the city in quatar hosting the 2022 world cup doesn't even exist yet
21762,"wow , that's not that far away ! when does the fifa world cup decide when it will be help ?"
21763,it's awarded every four years since 1930
21764,that's so many years ! i just like how they say goooooooooooooal !
21765,"yea but they make a lot of money , more than football , basketball , golf . and tennis combined"
21766,"i like to play chess more than football , but mostly because i don't want a head injury . i'm crazy enough without that , too !"
21767,"i haven't played chess much , apparently there are more moves than atoms in the universe , sounds untrue to me"
21768,"i've tried to be good at chess for years , but didn't start playing until i was a teenager . i'd try to come up with strategy moves but i always end up being the one who is checkmated ."
21769,"i was never good at chess , apparently there's a negative correlation between iq and the highest skilled players"
21770,i never knew until recently that chess was invented in india . i'd like to go to india and play chess . . . but maybe a few hundreds or even thousands of years ago back in time .
21771,"well at least before the 7th century , that's a lot of games of chess played"
21772,"well , it's not about chess being new when i play it but more about having much less pollution than there is now . stories i've heard make india seem like it was a paradise years ago ."
21773,"i have to go , it was nice talking with you"
21774,"hi , do you watch the world cup ?"
21775,"yes . it is festival , we enjoy for a month . all team are eager to lift the trophy they are working very hard ."
21776,yeah . i think peru is the team to watch .
21777,wining or loosing are the part of the game . nice to watch it .
21778,yeah but the hungary national team only had one defeat between 1950 and 1956 . so winning was a part . but losing ? not so much .
21779,"21 world cup tournament has been won by 8 teams , it is most prestigeous tournament of the world ."
21780,what about chess tournaments ?
21781,"chess is a two player strategy board game played on chessboard , chess is believed to be originated in india ."
21782,we need a chaturanga championship tournament .
21783,"yes , some of the eastern strategy games xiangqi , janggi and shogi . chess reached the european countries in 9th century ."
21784,but soccer makes more than all the major us sports combined . how much cash does chess bring in ?
21785,in 20th century computers have been programmed to play chess with increasing success . which also make the game very popular all over the world .
21786,but are there economic gains for countries that host chess tournaments ? there aren't for the world cup .
21787,the best player can awarded specific lifetime title by the world chess organization . grand master title is highest .
21788,"if chess was really invented by aliens , then a better title is in order ."
21789,it is very interesting .
21790,sure is . but not as interesting as 3 team soccer .
21791,"yes , chess is indoor game but soccer is outdoor both are totally different ."
21792,"yeah , i doubt jon stewart can play chess ."
21793,strong mental health is needed for any games for having tactics and handle the pressure of the game .
21794,it's also needed in order to have a good conversation . have a great day !
21795,i know a lot more about chess than soccer . what are peru's chances for a world cup ?
21796,"much better now that guerrero is back . . . so they say . i am with you , chess is closer to my heart . although the world cup is popular ."
21797,apparently the connection is elo ratings . the player ranking system for chess has been applied to world cup games .
21798,nice . too bad the fifa players can't ride on those little horses they use in chess .
21799,that would look a lot like polo . i would like some one to shout 'gooooolll ! ' when i make a good move in chess .
21800,muy bien ! fantastico ! give that person a boy scout merit badge in chess !
21801,these little bits of knowledge are fun . i wonder if more people play chess or soccer . less running in chess i think .
21802,"i like the idea that pawns each used to have their own names , based on commoner occupations . mcdonald's drive through attendant takes kings bishop . nice ."
21803,i have never heard that . is that something like rock paper lizard spock ? there are more possible move in a game of chess than atoms in the known universe .
21804,"and with a style where three players can play simultaneously , i can be beaten with any of those moves twice at the same time !"
21805,car wash squeegee man takes takes queens rook . the president of the world chess federation believes chess was invented by aliens . . . .
21806,stable boy wrestles rook away from squeegee man . i wonder if chaturanga was this much fun ?
21807,i bet it was . people in india like a good game . i wonder if the pieces were kind of like gods or just animals . elephant scooper moves forward two spaces .
21808,i wonder how different shogi is from chess ? bishop slides through remains of what the elephant scooper missed .
21809,i have no idea about shogi . chess reached europe by the 9th century . school lunch lady advances one space .
21810,pieces assumed their current powers in spain in the late 15th century . proctologist's assistant move in behind queens janitor .
21811,lol . the rules were standardized in the 19th century . chernobyl janitor moves to the eighth rank on the board and becomes a queen .
21812,"nice . not bad for a bunch of rocks on a 8x8 board ! qtip quality control assistant has the kings ear , influences next move ."
21813,"there is a negative correlation between iq and chess skill in strong players . tv weather man opens window and states the obvious , moves forward one space ."
21814,"the superbowl is smaller than the third biggest fifa event , but still much bigger than a pawn ."
21815,"soccer makes more money that football , basketball , baseball combined . mongo , pawn in game of life tired of drinking . does nothing"
21816,there was only one 1 group in world cup history that ended in a 4way tie . i lay down my king and genuflect at your feet .
21817,do you follow fifa soccer at all ?
21818,i do ! i was so happy to see france win the world cup again . long wait for the next one now .
21819,i think the women play this year ? right ?
21820,oh yeah that's right . should tide me over . the bids for the 2022 world cup were pretty crazy . did you see what countries were offering ?
21821,"yeah , and they chose qatar ."
21822,it's a good choice but japan would have been cool . they were going to project 3d holograms of the games ! beats 4k for sure .
21823,"that is crazy , that would definitely get my vote"
21824,hopefully it will be cool enough in qatar . it gets very hot there .
21825,"well , seeing as they havent even built the city that will host the final , they might be building some super cool indoor stadiums or something ."
21826,"yes with ac and all , however with things like this they never tend to go as planned . they still have time but for them at least i imagine time will fly by fast ."
21827,it always does . it is a shame no place ever really profits off hosting in the long run
21828,they can't with today's security costs . really it should just be played at the same place every time or at least every other time . it's crazy to think that the superbowl is smaller then soccers 3rd largest event .
21829,"the super bowl doesnt involve a lot of people , so many people follow soccer in the world"
21830,"yeah american football just doesn't have worldwide appeal . the people who do casually watch , watch for the commercials . soccer is played in over 200 countries so everyone grows up with it ."
21831,"that is true , it does even make more money that many other sports combined ."
21832,it probably helps you don't need much equipment to play either . you do need to be in shape though . soccer players run an average of 7 miles per game !
21833,thats why i always played keeper . far less running !
21834,yes ! do you play chess as well ? i find it very challenging when you are matched up with someone who is equally skilled .
21835,"i can play , but i am not very good . i cant see many moves ahead like some people can ."
21836,maybe you should try 3 person chess . there is a special board that allows 3 people to play all at once .
21837,i dont know about that . . . sounds like aliens might have invented that . . .
21838,lol . i'm not sure about the 3 person version but current chess boards were invented in spain in the 15th century but the game goes all the way back to before the 7th century !
21839,according to the president of the world chess federation it was invented by aliens .
21840,are you sure that wasn't a joke ? i think i'll go look into that . it was nice chatting with you .
21841,you never know . have a great night !
21842,what entertainment do you enjoy ?
21843,"i liked horror movies , like the exorcist ."
21844,so is horror your favorite genre ?
21845,"i don't think so . i think drama may be my favorite genre , but i do love some horror movies . i mentioned the exorcist because it is legitimately one of my favorites . i recently learned that during the filming of the movie , no one thought it was a horror film . that's funny ."
21846,for me horror is usually a hit or miss . i personally enjoy drama since it brings depth to a story either through tragedy or comedy
21847,"yes , a lot of horror doesn't interest me . i like some old slasher movies from the 80s though . what's your favorite dramatic movie ?"
21848,i think horror films are very subjective . you can even consider bambi to be one
21849,"the destruction of the environment , the death of close loved ones . . . pretty horrific . but seems more like a drama to me ! poor bambi . tell me why you think bambi could be a horror movie ! interested to hear your thoughts on that one ."
21850,"i mean for a little kid , seeing death is quite tramatic"
21851,"yes , learning about death as a little kid can be terrifying , and a movie like that might stick with you for a long time . learning about death is part of learning about the universe though , and i think it's pretty important ."
21852,"true , but how much will we ever really know about the universe ?"
21853,good question . . . i can't claim to know much about it other than that it's a crazy mystery . i think it's trippy thinking about the idea that our universe could exist inside of a black hole . it's like that movie inception or something .
21854,it is also hard to comprehend there is a region of space pulling galaxies outside the observable universe
21855,"yea that stuff blows my mind . i can't really comprehend it . also interesting that black holes apparently emit super low sound waves that humans can detect , not with their ears , but still , ."
21856,imagine if everything is one big superhologram ?
21857,right ? i remember reading recently that elon musk from tesla thinks that it's possible we live in one giant simulation . reminds me of the matrix . it's not too outrageous a thought when you learn how crazy the universe is .
21858,i mean there is even a theory that is only 1 electron in the universe . i can't even understand what that means
21859,same here . i kind of think of that cgi animation at the end of men in black where the camera zooms out from earth and our universe to the point where it all becomes a marble that is being played with by some galactic monster . it's actually kind of a comforting thought that the universe is so strange . . . it makes little things that happen in my life seem less weird .
21860,"i found it interesting how in the men in black , the galaxy was a marble"
21861,i love that movie . the sequels weren't so great in my opinion though . have you seen them ?
21862,"yes i found them to be decent . in any case , thanks for chatting ."
21863,do you know if hasbro was hurt by toys r us ?
21864,"it definetly was , toys r us was one of the biggest toy stores in the us and it closed its doors so that definetely affected the sales of many companies"
21865,what other companies could fill in the void left by toys r us ?
21866,"companies such as amazon , wallamart and even target are good options , what are your thoughts on these companies ?"
21867,it is hard to say . only about a third of the lost volume has been made up .
21868,"i guess theres more to it than just a great intermidiate , im sad about the workforce shortage the company has to make ."
21869,true . hasbro is expected to lost up to 60 million in severance .
21870,"thats a lot of money , so changing the subject a bit did you happen to see the movie frozen ?"
21871,i thought it was a good adaptation of the snow queen fairy tale .
21872,"it was pretty good , my daughter loved the movie , star wars is also another good franchise , both own by disney now"
21873,true . did you know marcia lucas is responsible for many iconic star wars moments .
21874,"behind every great man there is a great woman , i guess this phrase applies to george lucas and i didnt know that but it doesnt surprise me either ."
21875,"then again , james early jones is great , but he only made 7500 for his iconic role in star wars ."
21876,"only 7500 someone defintely got ripped off , kind of like fox with george lucas , although it was all because the lack of faith of the network in the franchise"
21877,"you know who didn't get ripped off ? amazon's first customer , who spent 27 . 95 and had a building named after him !"
21878,that sure is a bargain 27 . 95 for having a building named after you and plus you also get merchandize from the company
21879,true . they are tough negotatiors . they even got a contract for sunday deliveries with the usps !
21880,"wow , i bet amazon is one of the few companies to have a contract like that one , you know they have a patent on the 1click buying option"
21881,i heard that fact . amazing what can be accomplished in less than 25 years !
21882,"i know right , in just 25 years amazon has placed itself on the top of the world even higher than companies such as target and walmart"
21883,true ! thanks for the chat . i think i will go read something on my kindle !
21884,do you like toys r us ?
21885,"i used to , a lot . do you like them ?"
21886,well hasbro is catching it . they dropped 7 percent in sales .
21887,"wow , i also read they're down 24 percent internationally ."
21888,"yeah make way for bezos he's taking over the world , lol ."
21889,"yeah . he's also going to do the same for a lot of grocery stores , with the purchase of whole foods ."
21890,you know that frozen was directed by a woman . the first in disney history .
21891,wow . i know there is an olaf in space !
21892,how in the world did he get there ? the writer's name was jennifer lee . good for her .
21893,"yeah , that movie made 1b in box office . that's really impressive , regardless of sex ."
21894,"your right but i'm happy that a women will finally get some credit , you know ?"
21895,i agree ! i wish more women got more chances . us white guys really take up too many chances .
21896,yeah but don't blame yourself society has it set up that way . some one had a building named after them for being the first customer on amazon .
21897,"they spent like 30 for a building named after them . it doesn't matter what they bought , they got a name on a building !"
21898,"right i wonder what building it was . if you want to lose some weight you should get a job in their warehouse , lol . 715 miles a shift ."
21899,they hold the patent for 1click buying . apples pays them a licensing fee . i had no idea !
21900,"me either , this guy is a genius , im impressed . they also have a contract with usps ."
21901,their arrow means they have everything from a to z
21902,yup and they do . so they bought imbd in 1998 . ? he's trying to take over the world he should just run for president .
21903,only if there's 1click voting !
21904,right too funny ! ! nice chatting with you !
21905,ditto ! have a nice day !
21906,"hi , how are you ? do you like toys ?"
21907,"who doesn't like toys , lol ! hasbro been taking hits i hear ."
21908,"yeah , and then to blame it on a defunct , bankrupt company seems like they lack accountability . even i saw their demise ."
21909,yeah that's right looks like they were down 7 percent in revenues in the us and canada .
21910,and 24 percent internationally . they should have seen the amazon monster coming for them !
21911,yeah jeff should run for president .
21912,it would be interesting . he owns a lot so he has the platform .
21913,i remember toys r us as a kid . they embodied christmas . lol !
21914,"that catalog ! i went into my local store when they were closing , just to look around . and it was dead ! everything was gone and it was symbolic of my childhood at that point . i was so sad ."
21915,too funny ! apparently they owe hasbro 59m last september .
21916,woops ! that's a lot to have to write off or down . man !
21917,yeah ! have you ever seen frozen it was written by the first women for a disney film .
21918,i have seen that . i had no idea it was originally called snow queen .
21919,yeah it's a 2013 american 3d computer animated musical fantasy film .
21920,"they have had 53 animated feature films ! ? ! ? ! ? ! wow , i thought it was like 25 ."
21921,the first female director name was jennifer lee . good for her i wonder if she has any other works .
21922,she might not need to work again since frozen brought in 1b !
21923,i know that's awesome . they renamed rapunzel to tangled because it was too feminine and they thought it would not do as well .
21924,did you ever see brave ? that movie was great ! i loved how they did her hair .
21925,yes i have to say i saw that one too . alan tudyk has had a role in every disney film since wreck it ralph .
21926,"wow , he must be important . it has been nice chatting with you !"
21927,good morning to you ! how are you today
21928,good morning ! i'm doing well unlike toys r us . it's a shame they filed for bankruptcy .
21929,"i know , i'm still upset about that one . hasbro is blaming their 7 percent holiday drop on toys r us closing"
21930,i guess that it is possible . i've heard that hasbro is going to build a warehouse in the midwest to improve their shipping times . maybe that will help .
21931,yea their analysts at da davidson think that would be their best move . i think it could help with shipping costs to retailers
21932,maybe that will improve their bottom line . did you know that toys r us owed hasbro around 59 million last september ?
21933,thats a ton of money and probably not the only people they owed money to sadly . the hasbro brand covered some of the biggest licensed brands so its not surprising
21934,"you know , i think that if toys r us had lowered it's prices some they might still be in business . they were just too high priced compared to walmart and amazon ."
21935,both oo high priced and far too less convenient than shopping from home on amazon
21936,i agree with that . amazon is the largest internet retailer in the world .
21937,"with one of the most unique founders in the world , jeff bezos ."
21938,"he is . did you know he built a clock into a mountain that should last for 10 , 000 years ? the question there is , why ?"
21939,yup haha that's what i was referring to when i was saying he was unique . is he that bored ? that's crazy . amazon has explioded in growth since it was founded in 1994
21940,"it really has . i have to admit , whenever i want to buy something amazon is the first place i think of ."
21941,i think that's the case for almost everyone these days . they have so much stuff that warehouse workers tend to walk 715 miles every single shift
21942,"well , it's good exercise and good pay from what i hear . you know you are an important business though when the post office agrees to deliver your stuff on sundays !"
21943,they do that ? i thought the post offices were always closed on sundays ?
21944,"i did too , but i guess not for amazon ."
21945,thats crazy . almost as crazy as the first sale on amazon being for a building for 27 . 95 . can you imagine being the guy who did that ?
21946,that guy had to be either very trusting or very crazy lol ! i wonder what building it was !
21947,me too ! all i know is that i bet he's hapy he made that risk way back then
21948,"hello , how are you ?"
21949,"i'm great , you ?"
21950,"pretty good , do you like music ?"
21951,"absolutely , who doesn't ?"
21952,"yeah , some more than others . ed sheeran has a great vocal range !"
21953,"i really enjoy listening to ed sheeran , i've listened to every album ."
21954,"really that's interesting . yes , i do too ! he couch surfed for 2 1 or 2 years between gigs ."
21955,"yeah , i love the fact he is influenced by eminem , which is a true inspiration ."
21956,"yes , interesting lady gaga has four names ."
21957,wow really ?
21958,"three girl names , stefani joanne angelina ."
21959,"that is really pretty . i remember listening to her before she was famous . lady gaga is so close with elton john , he made her the god mother to his son ."
21960,"really , that's nice . pink floyd still got one of the best selling albums of 2014 ."
21961,"that is amazing , they are such a old group , i'm surprised so many people still listen to them . speaking of older groups , lady gaga's favorite band is iron maiden ."
21962,"i know , and that surprises me about lady gaga ! did you see the grammys this year ?"
21963,i watched a little bit of it .
21964,"i missed it , i did see some parts the next day . like to watched the before show interviews ."
21965,i believe there was a controversy about women not winning some categories .
21966,"yes , i see that . ny times stated only 9 percent of nominees have been women ."
21967,it's kind of ridiculous because the women this year have released better music than most men . at least in my opinion .
21968,"i know , crazy . justin biebers song ' love yourself ' was written by ed sheeran ."
21969,"i remember ed sheeran talking about this , i think it's cool ."
21970,"omg , two twins at 100 years old released a rap album in japan . lol"
21971,"oh my goodness , that is crazy ! lol anyway , it was nice talking to you , i've got to get some sleep . have a goodnight !"
21972,you too !
21973,"thanks , bye !"
21974,"hi , do you like lady gaga ?"
21975,yes ! i love lady gaga .
21976,did you know that her real name is stefani joanne angelina germanotta ?
21977,"i think i knew her name is stefani . i had no idea that she has two middle names . joanne , i believe , was the name of her grandmother ."
21978,"that's cool . i heard she first began performing as a teenager , singing at open mic nights and acting in school plays . what's your favorite gaga song ?"
21979,i did not know she did school plays . i think my favorite song is actually the song named after her grandmother called ' joanne ' . do you have a favorite song by her ? are you a fan ? ?
21980,"i became a pretty big fan in 2008 when her first album , the fame was released and contained poker face . did you see the new movie she is in with bradley cooper ?"
21981,i cannot believe that album was nearly ten years ago . i have no seen it . i did see they won a grammy for the song 'shallow' the other night . i think that is the name of the song anyway .
21982,"you're right , that was the name of the song . the movie is very good too , you should definitely see it . it's funny that lady gaga got her name from a predictive text glitch that changed ' radio ' to ' lady '"
21983,this is what everyone keeps telling me . i enjoy bradley cooper so i think i would like the movie . i am really glad that she went with 'lady gagy' and not 'radio gaga' . . . .
21984,"yeah , it definitely wouldn't have the same ring to it . it's interesting that she became so popular that the lapd asked for her assistance . they asked her to tweet to her 11 . 4 million followers about information for some upcoming road work so the word would get out faster ."
21985,i read that ! good thing some celebrity influence can do some good . . . if that is considered good lol i didn't know elton john had any children . not surprised that lady gage is the godmother .
21986,that's cool she's elton's son's godmother . . . does lady gaga have any children of her own ? it's funny that she was on mtv's ' boiling points ' before anyone ever knew she was going to be famous
21987,"no , she does not have any of her own children . i wonder if i can find that clip of her on boiling points somewhere . would be interesting to see what she looked like . she had to have been 18 or 19 at the time i would guess ?"
21988,probably so . . . it's interesting that many big artists appeared on television shows before they were famous . justin timberlake and britney spears were both on the mickey mouse club when they were much younger .
21989,i remember reading about britney spears and justin timberlake being on the mickey mouse club when they were children . ryan gosling was on there as well !
21990,"do you think ed sheeran was on any tv shows before he was famous ? i didn't realize he had written ' love yourself ' but gave it away to justin bieber , lol ."
21991,if he has been it was definitely in the
21992,it's weird that eminem is one of ed's biggest musical influences . . . their musical styles couldn't be any more different .
21993,it was definitely in the uk . i don't know what happened there . ed sheeran has had to have written for many people . i would never have guessed eminem for one of his musical influences . that is strange !
21994,definintely strange . . . nice talking to you !
21995,"hi , how are you ?"
21996,good this morning ! yourself ? did you watch the grammys ?
21997,i did not . i am not a huge awards show person . what about you ? did you watch them ?
21998,i did . i was really disappointed that kesha and sza were snubbed . i thought they would get some kind of nod .
21999,i know kesha but not sza . do you know sza ?
22000,"sza sings r and b . she is pretty good . when the grammy guy was asked why more women weren't nominated , he blamed women , not a good move ."
22001,seems like he was shirking responsibility for sexism .
22002,"it sure looks like it . although he did make a good point . if women want to be recognized , they do have o step up and make their voices heard ."
22003,"kesha sued her producer for sexual assault and despite the evidence , he was let off . seems like she is not getting justice in either arena . . ."
22004,that is so true . i loved her video tik tok too . sing it almost every day even if it is silly . i thought lady gaga would at least be mentioned for her music in that film she did with bradley cooper .
22005,her super bowl leap was crazy . did you see that last year ?
22006,no ! i'll have to look that up . i guess lorde was pretty ticked off at the grammy's too . they wouldn't let her sing .
22007,i do think they should add the most tone deaf spoken word statement award . so many white males would be nominated !
22008,"they would ! i guess ed sheeran won for this year ! : ,"
22009,i like him . . . don't tell my judgmental friends . . .
22010,": , i do too . he makes loving music . fun stuff . did you see the white roses everyone wore to the grammy's by any chance ?"
22011,i did not . what did they signify ?
22012,the time's up initiative . a legal fund set up for victims of sexual harassment ! huge support for it .
22013,speaking of white males . . . i found or find that whole movement disappointingly necessary . can't people just act right ?
22014,"that would be nice , but men have run the industry for so long , they think it's their privilege . do you ever listen to lady gaga ?"
22015,i have in the past . do you listen to her ?
22016,not too much . i watched her video with bradley cooper last night . she is so much prettier without all the make up . i watched her a little in american horror story . was really over the top .
22017,nice chatting with you !
22018,do you like kesha ? personally i think shes a great artist with a lot of talent
22019,"ya i do like her , can't believe she was snubbed last year at the grammys"
22020,"yeah and also ed sheeran had a controversial win , not sure if he deserved that ."
22021,"ya i can't say i agree , do you like lady gaga btw ?"
22022,"yeah i do , not only as a singer but shes also a great actress , what about you ? do you like her ?"
22023,"ya she does a good job , i guess she was born back in 1986 which is one year younger than me haha"
22024,"shes a young artist , she has a lot to give , many singles , many movies to come ."
22025,"ya i could see that , its funny she got her name from a predictive text glitch that changed radio to lady"
22026,it is funny just like how the lapd asked her to tweet info about an upcoming roadwork in the town
22027,"ya that was funny , also cool is elton john who chose lady gaga to be his son's godmother , thats cool"
22028,"thats interesting , did you ever watch the shoe boiling points on mtv ?"
22029,"nope never heard of it , what is it about ?"
22030,"its a show that used to ran on mtv it was like a reality tv kind of show , well lady gaga was on it"
22031,"oh i see , ya i like her early hits like poker face and just dance i think those were some of her best songs"
22032,"those are great songs , i like the as well , lady gaga has a favorite band , not the less than iron maiden ."
22033,"wow that is crazy the music is completely different , and ya she has sold over 27 million albums and 150 million singles , shes one of the best selling artists in teh history of music"
22034,yeah they have like completely opposite styles just like ed sheeran cite eminem as one of fhis biggest influences .
22035,"ah that is interesting , he also has a better vocal range than freddie mercury which is crazy"
22036,"thats suprising since freddie mercury had a really great and unique voice , ed sheeran is a great artits but mercury is in another league ."
22037,"ya i agree , nothing ed has made touches freddie's stuff , although it was nice that ed gave the song love yourself to bieber to sing"
22038,"yeah that was a nice thing to do , i guess they must be really good friends , sheeran had a rough road to becoming the artist he is now"
22039,"ya it sounds like he did , had to couch surf for 2 years and sleep outside , that sounds tough"
22040,yeah it souds that way
22041,do you like pop music ?
22042,"its ok , did you know most pop hits use the same 4 chords"
22043,"yes , very interesting , you can do a lot with 4 chords . did you know that in a 2012 study they found out that pop music has grown louder and more musically homogeneous since the mid60's ? i believe that accounts for the 4 chord harmony ."
22044,"probably , i do like ' we are the champions ' , which is considered the catchiest pop song of all time"
22045,pop music is part of our culture and other cultures as well . the president of indonesia released 3 pop albums while in office .
22046,"funny , must not be too busy being president . i read that some pop record labels send out rejection letters that start with ' dear loser '"
22047,"ha , no doubt . still pop music is ' popular ' . ricky gervais was a pop singer in the 80's . and , north korea even has its own kpop girl band named the ' moranbong band ' which is the most popular music group in their country ."
22048,"wow , how about the beatles , regarded as one of the most influential bands in history"
22049,the beatles were cool . they started beatlemania back in the 60's and they became integral to the pop music evolution and helped turn it into the art form that it is today .
22050,"nice , they broke in 1970 before any of them were even 30"
22051,"yes , they had political interests too . another interesting fact is that the beatles's song ' come together ' was written for timothy leary's 1969 california governor campaign ."
22052,"interesting , and they used the word love 613 times in their songs !"
22053,"yes , the beatles are known for that although none of the beatles could actually read music . on top of that , they literally stopped touring because back in the day you couldn't hear them over the screaming in the audience ."
22054,"i can imagine , and no touring needed , aerosmith made more money from guitar hero then any album"
22055,"yes , the beatles have a guitar hero game as well . funny , another strange thing i found out was that ringo starr was illiterate for most of his childhood because he missed three years of school because he had tuberculosis and peritonitis ."
22056,"did not know that , walt disney did double track vocals 10 years before the beatles did"
22057,"the beatles ran the gamet though . they went from 50's type rock and roll to pop ballads and then to indian music and finally to psychedelia and hard rock . and , all the while they incorporated classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways ."
22058,"quite resourceful , people stop traffic to recreate beatles image at abbey road too"
22059,"cool . yes , abbey road was one of their best albums . they even had the best selling album of the 2000's . apparently part of that ' beatlemania ' carries on in today's world ."
22060,"definitely , nice chatting"
22061,same here . have a good one .
22062,are you a fan of pop music ?
22063,i do like pop music . also jazz and rock . how about you ?
22064,"i love pop music , especially the late 90s early 00s ! it has been around since the 50s"
22065,do you like 80s pop ? it has a distinct sound . i think that it is popular with the kids now because it is nostalgic .
22066,"i don't know if i ever heard of that king . i once heard music from ricky gervais in the 80s , that was interesting !"
22067,there are many wonderful pop songs from that time . you can find them on youtube . impress your friends with your knowledge of ancient pop .
22068,"i will have to look them up . i heard north korea has its own pop style , that would be interesting to listen to !"
22069,i think that nk must have a pretty bad kind of pop . probably syrupy and stuff . i bet they sing about the dead leader .
22070,for sure and then cry about it lol ! do you have any favorite albums ?
22071,no favorite albums . i usually listen to songs on youtube . i do like some jazz albums on there i guess . what about you ?
22072,"i like linkin parks hybrid theory , that best selling album in the 21st century . i also liked the beatles albums , but now yes i listen to on youtube a lot now"
22073,lp made a great album . they deserve to be 1 . too bad about their singer .
22074,"right , sad that people battle those demons . were you a fan of nwa"
22075,"i was not a fan , but they sure could spit mad fire ."
22076,"for sure , they released their album and it became platinum without major air play or tours !"
22077,"they knew that the streets was hungry for some real beats , real truth . they did not need to market reality to the people ."
22078,"for sure , they coined f the police i think , great song though . almost as good as the songs made by 2 100 year old twins from japan ."
22079,i want to hear what those twins released . it must be about arthritis and stuff .
22080,"lol , and a lot of back pain and back in my days ! lol ! great chatting with you !"
22081,i enjoyed chatting as well ! have a good day !
22082,"you too , bye !"
22083,"hi there , do you like fish"
22084,"hi , i sure do . do you know much about them ?"
22085,i know some stuff . there is a specis of them that can eat prety twice their size
22086,wow that is amazing . do you know how long a goldfish once lived ?
22087,"hmm maybe 10 years , i am not sure how long they can live ."
22088,"well this guy lived to be 43 , that is a lot"
22089,yeah that is amazing . do you know which fish has a neck ?
22090,"hmm there is a fish that has a neck ? do not know , which one is it ?"
22091,yeah it is the seahorse actually and they are the only ones too
22092,"oh cool , i did not know seahorses are qualified as fish to be honest"
22093,yeah i know . there is a species of jellyfish that is immortal .
22094,"wow , maybe we need to study them . and they evaporate in the sun because they are made of water mostly"
22095,yeah they are pretty cool . do you know why there is so much research on zebrafish ?
22096,"hmm i do not know that , are they somehow related to us ?"
22097,in a way . genes that are responsible for diseases in us can be found in them too
22098,oh wow then it totally makes sense to study them and invest in that kind of research
22099,yeah exactly . do you use the computer much ?
22100,all the time actually . do you know what captcha is an acronym for ?
22101,i actually do not know that good question . do you know ?
22102,yeah it stands for completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart .
22103,"wow that is very long , i like the acronym much better ."
22104,"so , is there a national pi day , or is just someones hope ?"
22105,that is funny . it must be a mathematicians dream .
22106,"actually i just looked it up , march 14th . it's a day to celebrate mathematics , some people just buy pies though ."
22107,oh i see . nice . many people think the world would be a better place if we can appreciate things beyond the scientific fields .
22108,"i used to enjoy doing math at school , until it got too theoretical . talk of quantum math just baffles me ."
22109,yeah it is very tough stuff . i liked biology and learning about fish . so amazing they lack limbs with digits !
22110,math must difficult without fingers to do the basics on .
22111,ha ha yes i would imagine so . there's only one fish who has a neck and that is the seahorse .
22112,"is a seahorse a fish . i suppose it can't be anything else . what about jellyfish , are they fish ?"
22113,yes i guess it is considered a fish but i am not certain . as for jellyfish i believe so . there is even a breed of jellyfish that never dies . maybe a blessing or maybe a curse .
22114,"how would you know ? you can't ask it , and you can't watch it all the time , i'd need some kind of proof to believe that ."
22115,yes true . i would like to know more . they probably get eaten all the time too . by the black swallower fish perhaps !
22116,is that the one that eats ten times its weight ? that's how i feel after thanksgiving meals .
22117,haha yes thats the one . also the zebra fish shares 84 percent of genes known to be associated with human disease .
22118,"if they are that closely related maybe the have the capacity to play chess ? of course , we are back to them not having limbs and fingers , so maybe not ."
22119,ha ha yeah i would like to know more about that . some people actually believe that chess was created by aliens .
22120,"those people are probably more closely related to the zebra fish than just 84 percent . i understand it came from india , mot mars ."
22121,very interesting . there was once a chess grandmaster who beat somebody without even looking at the board . that would be embarrassing .
22122,"i might be the one on the losing side . i used to have a computer chess set when i was a kid . i figured out how to cheat it , so never really learned anything from it , aside from how to cheat ."
22123,oh interesting i would be curious to know how people cheat . there are more possible moves in a game of chess than they are atoms in the known universe .
22124,"i know , there's this story of the invention of teh game , and how the creator asked for a grain of rice to be double every square of the board . by the time you get to the last square there is more rice than exists . have a good day ."
22125,do you like fish ? i love them !
22126,i think fish are crazy how many are out there haha . the oldest goldfish ever was 43 years old !
22127,that is incredible ! lol the black swallower fish can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight !
22128,dang that fish doesn't care at all lol . have you ever seen a species of fish that lives on land all its adult life ?
22129,no i have't . what's that called ?
22130,"i'm not sure either lol , was hoping you would know . have you ever seen a jellyfish evaporate in the sun ?"
22131,i haven't ! but i know that there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal !
22132,i wouldn't want to mess with them ! they are 98 percent water so i'm sure it's easy to evaporate in the sun !
22133,i bet ! freshwater fish only drink through their skin via osmosis while saltwater fish drink water through their mouths .
22134,that is one interesting fact ! can you believe there was a fish that lived for 226 years ? i wonder how many owners it had ?
22135,that is pretty cool ! i've heard koi fish can live a long time . a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck !
22136,you would guess there would be others but i guess not ! so what kind of computer do you own ?
22137,i have a personal computer . they are in so many devices now it's crazy .
22138,i agree ! do you know what captcha stands for since we probably see it all the time on here ?
22139,i don't know . what does it stand for ?
22140,completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart . say that ten times fast lol .
22141,lol the space shuttle's general purpose computer ran on 1mb of ram !
22142,that's crazy ! you would think it would take up more huh ? have you ever played the game doom ?
22143,i remember when that first came out in the mid90s lol yes i played it back then .
22144,"that was the most installed piece of software on computers in 1995 , ahead of windows 95 itself haha . it was nice chatting with you !"
22145,nice ! have a great night ! it's been fun !
22146,hello do you like taylor swift ?
22147,"hey there ! i can tolerate taylor swift , she's not my favorite or anything , what about you ? did you know that she'll walk backwards so that her picture can't be taken by paparazzi ?"
22148,"i like her music , i dont know much about her . that is pretty funny and probably effective !"
22149,yeah i could see it being effective . do you know who olaf the snowman is ? the one from the movie frozen ? i guess she dressed up as him on tour haha that's pretty funny
22150,"wow thats awesome , yes i love olaf lol taylor swift accidently released 8 seconds of white noise and topped the canada charts lol"
22151,"haha that's funny . that's some really expensive white noise lol . i guess that she came from a wealthy family too , she lived on a tree farm that was about 11 acres in size"
22152,"wow , must be nice !"
22153,"she does seem like she's a giver though , all the proceeds from her tour called wildest dream to an african wildlife conservation center"
22154,yeah ive heard of her donating to a lot of charities and even others in need . she gave kesha money to fight her sexual harrassment case too .
22155,"well that's nice of her . does a lot of pop crossovers too , which is cool . it's also impressive that she started her music career at the age of 14 ."
22156,taylor swift removed her music from spotify because ' music shouldnt be free '
22157,"that's interesting . you like her song that's called ' our song ' ? apparently she was the youngest person to write and perform a number one country hit , with that song ,"
22158,"no i havent heard of that one , is it good ?"
22159,"no i haven't either . i'm not a massive fan of hers , but she does seem very talented so i'll have to check some of her stuff out . do you like any other albums ? not necessarily by her"
22160,"yes absolutely , my favorite right now is bryce vine . i hear linkin parks album hybrid theory is the best selling of the 21st century ."
22161,ok i'll have to check that out . what do you think about aerosmith ? apparently they need more money by lending their rights to the guitar hero franchise then buy any kind of record sales lol that's crazy
22162,"i think that was a great idea in my opinion , guitar hero was a hit because of their contribution , thats a lot of royalties ."
22163,"yes i agree ! i love playing those games when i was in high school , do you like led zeppelin by the way ? i love that they didn't name their fourth album just to mess with the rock press , wish they hated"
22164,i never really listened to their music . thats hilarious .
22165,"you should check them out , they're actually really good ! just don't buy any records at walmart by the way , they only sell clean versions of records , that would really annoy me"
22166,"yeah that is annoying , i wanna hear the music the artist released , not some edited version ."
22167,hey how's it going are you a star wars fan ? i actually really enjoyed the solo star wars film !
22168,i like some of them . did you know that al pacino turned down the role of han solo because he couldn't understand the script ?
22169,hah that's kind of funny and sad at the same time . i thought ron howard did a good job directing .
22170,i thought he did so too . alden ehrenreich did really good as han solo .
22171,yeah he was great . i liked the movie because it took place 10 years after ' a new hope ' so it gave some closure .
22172,yeah and that's what i feel that series lacks is closure . there's too many open loops in the story line for me .
22173,yeah it always leaves you hanging . but there were some answered questions . i liked how han solo was a tie fighter pilot before piloting the millennium falcon !
22174,yeah and he also was an imperial lieutenant before his companionship with chewbacca .
22175,interesting . did you know george lucas originally intended han solo to be a large green alien or a black man ?
22176,"that's pretty interesting , he also considered christopher walker for as han solo ."
22177,oh he wouldn't be too bad . have you seen deadpool 2 by chance ? i loved ryan reynolds in that !
22178,i loved that movie . did you know that the video game cost more to make than the movie ?
22179,wow how is that even possible ? it is also the highest grossing film of all time not directed by lucas or cameron !
22180,"that is wild ! in a 2004 comic book series , deadpool described himself as ' ryan reynolds crossed with a sharpei , ' this lead reynolds to believe he was destined for the role ."
22181,haha very cool . he really played the role well . he even voiced the mystery villain !
22182,i heard that the screenwriters released that . that's pretty neat .
22183,very neat indeed . in addition to watching movies i also love to travel . did you know the japanese highway tolls are extremely expensive ? i would hope they have nice roads .
22184,i've heard that it cost more than 300 to travel across the country . i'd hope they use that money on the roads .
22185,yeah seriously i would hope so . i wonder how much it would cost to ride in those dutch buses that go up to 160mph ? !
22186,"i'm not sure , but i feel it would be worth it . i wish i had one when i was going on business trips !"
22187,yeah that would have been cool . also i love hawaii and they had a king who loved to travel too ! nice chatting with you !
22188,"hello , what is your favorite movie ?"
22189,"i really like the movie the godfather . one movie that i think is only ok though is deadpool 2 , did you see that movie"
22190,i have seen dead pool 2 . it is probably my favorite movie of all time ! although i also do really like solo a star wars story
22191,"yeah deadpool 2 came out in 2018 , i actually like the first one a lot but didn't really like the second , did you ever play the video game"
22192,"no i have not , although i heard the video game was decent . have you ever played the video game ?"
22193,yes i did . the video game is actually really good ! and shockingly it cost more than the first deadpool movie to make
22194,"that makes sense , as it costs the video game developers a lot of money to design the graphics , and a lot more to market the game ."
22195,"do you remember in deadpool to the mystery villain ? apparently ryan reynolds does his voice , i wonder who the villain is going to be in deadpool 3 though"
22196,i wonder too . deadpool is the highest grossing r rated film that was not directed by george lucas or james cameron ! no wonder it was so successful
22197,yes i agree . you said that you like star wars movies right ? did you know that han solo used to be a tie fighter pilot ?
22198,no i did not ! han solo was apparently also an imperial lieutenant before meeting up with chewbacca .
22199,"well that is interesting , also george lucas wanted him to be a large green alien or a black man originally lol that would have been a very different movie"
22200,i am glad that they chose for him to be a very furry person . he is one of my favorite star wars characters .
22201,"yep i agree , i love harrison ford , what if they chose christopher walken though ? he was in the running for it"
22202,i wonder what would have happened then . maybe we should just be happy that the things are the way they are because the movie turned out to be excellent .
22203,"yes we totally should . a lot of things came together well because if you was available , for instance al pacino turned down han solo's role because he didn't understand the script that would have been totally different too"
22204,it would have been very different . do you think that we will ever be in a world similar to that of star wars ?
22205,"no i don't think so , that world is too fantastical i think , what do you think ? i would like to travel to outer space though"
22206,speaking of travelling . did you know that all of japans highways have tolls ? it would cost over 300 to travel across japan !
22207,"yeah that sounds expensive , it would be fun to ride that dutch bus 160 miles per hour on those road so lol ."
22208,i wonder if there had been many accidents with those buses because 160 mph does not sound very safe !
22209,"no thats definitely really fast . maybe i'll take a trip to mackinac island though , they don't have buses or any kinds of cars for that matter , only horses"
22210,"i tell you , this taylor swift is a magnet for controversy ."
22211,"ahhh . . you know , haters gonna hate ! lol . seriously though , yeah , i heard she's being sued !"
22212,at least its not kanye west suing . i hear he mocked himself on snl .
22213,"really ? i didn't see that ep . course , i haven't watched snl in a good while . i did recently do a bunch of ' weekend update ' clips on youtube though . norm mcdonald is hilarious !"
22214,"yeah , he made fun of himself for interrupting taylor at an award shot ."
22215,"yeah , i remember that happening . . . where was that , the mtv awards ? you know what's weird ? taylor swift often walks backwards to keep from getting her pic taken . i bet the paparazzi love that ."
22216,whoa . she could always fly away from them in her dassault falcon 900 jet .
22217,"i have to admit , as sappy as it is , i do find ' you belong with me ' a rather catchy song ."
22218,i would like to hear nwa do that . maybe put it on a rerelease of straight outta compton
22219,"get the feeling they'd add in a lot more swear words . lol . speaking of which , did you know walmart only sells ' clean ' versions of albums ? found that kind of interesting . ."
22220,wow . remind me not to shop at walmarts . . . unless i'm buying a rap album made by 100 year old japanese twins
22221,there's a rap album by 100 year old twins ? what are some of the songs on it ?
22222,lol ! it's almost as good as the 8 second white noise taylor swift once released .
22223,speaking of albums . . . you a big led zeppelin fan ?
22224,"yeah . i like zep and 70's rock in general . i hear pink floyd's dark side of the moon was a bestseller in 2014 , believe it or not . ,"
22225,"i just think it's funny how lz didn't title any of their first four albums . i've heard they did that just to annoy the rock press . , along with once releasing an album under a different band name . . . ,"
22226,what name did they release an album under ? linkin park ?
22227,"no , it was a bunch of weird symbols and stuff . i don't know what it was ' unofficially ' called . but from what i understand , they did it to prove it wasn't just the ' brand name ' that was bringing in fans ."
22228,maybe they crashed the rock press party by announcing they just recorded what had to be the best album of all time !
22229,"you mentioned dark side of the moon earlier . . speaking of albums with staying power , legend by bob marley has been on the album chart for over 914 weeks ! i find that pretty amazing !"
22230,whoa ! . i'm going to go jammin now . nice chatting .
22231,"hi , do you like taylor swift ?"
22232,i am not a fan . i'm not a ' hater ' but i just never developed an appetite for her work . i would rather play monopoly . . . you ?
22233,yea i don't really like her music . i saw kanye west did an snl skit mocking himself for his interruption to swift .
22234,"interesting guy that kanye . . . have you heard any of his albums ? not as creative as thom yorke playing his laptop on a radiohead album , but still pretty creative nonetheless !"
22235,he's very interesting . i have not heard much of his music . swift owns a falcon 900 jet that cost 40 million .
22236,"poor girl . . . couldn't afford a bigger plane . . . maybe she will write a sad song about it . . . until then we will just have to listen to legend by marley , on the charts for over 900 weeks !"
22237,lol . she once released 8 seconds of white noise and topped the canadian itunes charts with it . . . lol !
22238,"it must have been winter in canada , where everything is white anyway ! i wonder if walmart sells that ' hit ? ' they only sell clean music !"
22239,lol . that's interesting about walmart . i did see linkin park
22240,they were quite popular . i don't know if they made any games though . aerosmith made more money with guitar hero than from any album .
22241,guitar hero was huge so i can see that happening . reel big fish once rerecorded all of their albums because they lost the rights to their old record company .
22242,at least they are willing to work for it ! taylor swift dressed up like olaf when she was on tour during the halloween season . that's working the crowd !
22243,that's working the crowd for sure ! two identical twins in japan once released a rap album at 100 years old .
22244,cool ! i wonder if swift will still be holding concerts at 100 ? she probably will still have to walk backwards to avoid being photographed . . .
22245,i bet so . do you like the game monopoly ?
22246,"sure ! i may still be playing a game i started two weeks ago . . . long game . . . nicolas cage convinced johnny depp to become an actor while playing monopoly , so i am keeping my options open !"
22247,wow that's interesting and good to know . i saw it was originally intended to be a teaching tool about injustices of capitalism .
22248,ironic how much money the game has made since then ? another sad irony : nearly every top mcdonalds monopoly prize from 19952000 was fraudulently won by some insiders . . . send them directly to jail and do not pass go !
22249,haha that's a good point . i've always liked playing the game .
22250,"did you know that the orange properties are the best ones , statistically speaking ?"
22251,"i did not know that . well , it was good talking to you !"
22252,do you like to read ?
22253,i love literature ! i was just reading a fact about how there is an annual contest for writers to come up with the worst opening line in a novel !
22254,that is funny . i don't read a lot but apparently a lot of adults do . over half of adults have library cards .
22255,"oh that's too bad , books are like living in another life , i am always reading something ! i love the library too it has everything under one roof . you can even get cd's and movies there !"
22256,in sacramento you can even rent sewing machines and other things that you don't need to own long term . i could definitely see myself using that library .
22257,haha ! wow i didn't know that . definitely want to go there lol . . . . . . there are more libraries in the us than mcdonalds ! that's a lot .
22258,"yep , libraries are pretty important , especially to uk prime minister william gladstone . he founded his own public library and wheelbarrowed his 32 , 000 books to the library himself . he was 85 !"
22259,"what ! that's awesome ! i agree though they are important . i heard in norway if you publish a book the government buys 1000 copies and hands them out to the libraries , very cool !"
22260,i'm glad they understand the importance of libraries ! a man who was falsely imprisoned for 10 years also didhe spent all the time he could there in order to prove his innocence .
22261,that is amazing ! very smart man . so do you ever watch comedy movies at all ? they are my favorite !
22262,"yes , i like comedy the most . they help me to relax ."
22263,me too ! i have my favorites on dvd still lol . . . or i can stop by the library to check on out too .
22264,do you like any bromantic comedies like the hangover or harold and kumar ?
22265,"yes ! those are too funny ! one of my fav comedy's is i love you man , great flick !"
22266,"did you ever watch seinfeld , friends or frasier ?"
22267,"yes , love all of them . i heard 3rd rock from the sun won a golden globe over those very tv shows !"
22268,"yes , i heard that too which is surprising because i never really thought 3rd rock was that great ."
22269,"i know , i never did get into that show . i think seinfeld is the best !"
22270,i used to like friends a lot . what do you think about silent movies ?
22271,i think slapstick comedy is cool to watch sometimes ! gotta love charlie chaplin !
22272,it's interesting how comedy films evolved once we got sound !
22273,"hi , do you like literature ?"
22274,"i enjoy reading , i just don't seem to get enough time anymore to read as much as i'd like ."
22275,me too . the fda once burned six tons of literature in the us as an act of censorship .
22276,"you don't associate the us with book burning , kind of sad that it happens ."
22277,i agree . i think it's very sad to censor literature like that .
22278,"would you be reader , literature or otherwise ?"
22279,i would be a reader . what about you ?
22280,"i am always driving the kids to places and waiting in the car , i get a little reading done then , for the most part i'm too busy at home to sit and read ."
22281,"me too . in 1953 , churchill won a nobel prize for literature ."
22282,"he was an accomplished person . literature , and being a great prime minister for britain . i believe he was also decent painter ."
22283,i agree . do you like going to the library ?
22284,"we go often , my daughter loves to read and goes through book daily , i take her to the library to stock at least once a week ."
22285,that's good . there are more libraries than mcdonald's in the us .
22286,"finally some good news . i like the idea in norway were if you publish a book the government gets it in to the library system ,"
22287,that would be very cool . there was once a man falsely imprisoned and studied law to prove his innocence and became a lawyer .
22288,"i also like the library of things that they doing in sacramento , i would absolutely use that ."
22289,i do too . do you like comedy ?
22290,"i enjoy a good comedy movie , nice to relax after a long week and watch something with the whole family ."
22291,me too . comedy is one of my favorite movie dramas .
22292,"usually comedy movies are where we , as a whole family , can agree to watch . otherwise there is too much disagreement among us . we all like bill murray ."
22293,"i love bill murray . well , it was good talking with you . have a good day ."
22294,do you like to read ? do you find literature interesting ?
22295,i do ! i honestly hate knowing the fda burned six tons of literature to censor it from us citizens . that really bothers me ! no telling what amazing work they destroyed !
22296,"that seems like an extreme act to hide opinions and the thoughts of others , it bothers me as well literature shouldnt be banned like that ."
22297,"agreed ! i wonder how winston churchill would have felt about that ! after all , he won a nobel prize for literature back in 1953 !"
22298,"yeah in fact he had many nomitations , around 5 and only won in one occasion , he was a talented writter"
22299,"indeed he was ! and he won the prize one year after the olympics got rid of literature as well as music , painting , sculpture and architecture ."
22300,did he ever win a novel prize for peace ?
22301,"i don't believe so ! i think it was only for literature ! hey , i wonder if he ever entered that literature contest that makes writers think of horrible opening sentences for novels ?"
22302,"i dont know but its an interesting question , i will research that for sure and sounds like an interesting contest , i might win"
22303,"that would be awesome ! maybe they'll even put your winning work in a library ! you know , if you publish your book in norway , the government will purchase 1000 copies and send them to libraries across their country ."
22304,"really ? i guess thats a great way to get started , it migh be really lucrative to become a writter over there"
22305,"agreed ! but hey , at least in the us , there are more libraries than there are mcdonald's . plus over half the adult population still have library cards !"
22306,theres no excuse for not reading then
22307,"exactly . i mean , if a man who was falsely imprisoned for 10 years can spend a lot of his time at a library studying law to help prove his innocence , then we all should read !"
22308,"i heard about that guy , he certainly study a lot its a good thing now he helps other people who have been falsely convicted"
22309,"so true ! they could make a great movie out of that story . speaking of movies , are you into comedies at all ? i agree with bill murray that kung fu hustle is the supreme achievement of the modern age comedy !"
22310,"i liked it a lot but i wouldnt say its the supreme achievement of the modern age comedy , one crazy character is ryan stiles , he dropped out of highschool to pursue a career in comedy , thats a big risk"
22311,"agreed and it really worked out for the better for ryan , didn't it ? kind of like demetri martin who left harvard due to being bored and pursued a career in comedy too !"
22312,"yeah apparently things worked out for him , but he took a hard decision , demetri martin left college so that was also a hard choice to make specially if you study in harvard"
22313,"exactly . wise decision , in my opinion . comedy seems to put more focus on individual stars unlike so many other genres !"
22314,"comedy lighten ups the world , did you ever watch 3rd rock from the sun ?"
22315,"i do ! in fact , i'm so glad it beat out seinfeld , frasier and friends for best comedy series at the golden globes back in 1997 . it was by far the most deserving . well , it was great chatting with you !"
22316,hi there . do you like literature ? i think it is a true honest art form .
22317,i do like literature . do you have a favorite author ?
22318,not really i like mixing it up . you ? winston churchill is a classic scholar as he won the nobel prize in 1953 .
22319,i really tried to read the last lion and it was a tough read . did you ever read anything about him ?
22320,"no i would like to though , he sounds like an interesting guy . i always thought he won a nobel peace prize ."
22321,he didn't win one ? i wonder why ? i know he didn't have ' success ' until later in life but that surprises me .
22322,"yes very surprising . the arts seemed to be very important in the past , they were even apart of the olympic events until 1952 !"
22323,would you ever take a class in heavy metal ? it's taught at a college !
22324,yes i would love to ! i would probably be terrible at it though and cause people to laugh kind of like a comedy film !
22325,do you like comedy ? i love them !
22326,yes i do . so humorous and fun to watch ! many have happy endings too !
22327,i agree . comedy central has canceled over 100 shows . sad . . .
22328,i wonder why ? have you seen 3rd rock from the sun ? it won a golden globe for best comedy in 1997 !
22329,i loved that show although french stewart was so annoying !
22330,"do you think it deserved to beat out seinfeld , friends , and frasier for the golden globe that year ?"
22331,"in general , no but there was some really great years for 3rd rock and a few stinkers for the others ."
22332,yes i agree that tends to be how most shows go . i really like movies from the bromantic comedy genre like the hangover . zach galifinakis is my favorite !
22333,he is so funny . i like step brothers too !
22334,oh man that is one of my all time favorites ! ! bill murray said kung fu hustle was one of the supreme achievements in modern age comedy . do you think he was being sarcastic ?
22335,i think so but who knows ! he is a little ecsentric !
22336,yes no doubt about that . that comedian ryan stiles took a big chance by dropping out of high school but it paid off for him . hey it was really nice talking with you today !
22337,it was great talking with you too . have a good one !
22338,hi how are you ? do you like to travel ?
22339,"i do like to travel always wanted to visit iceland , what about you ?"
22340,i have never been there . it sounds like an interesting country . the name is misleading .
22341,"yeah the name is misleading but it has beautiful landscapes in it , iceland doesnt have a rail service ."
22342,i think the terrain is probably bad for rail . they probably have pretty good roads .
22343,yeah i bet they do and also a lot of airlines many people use air to travel between towns .
22344,that could get expensive . i would rather take the bus if its cheap .
22345,"maybe its cheap , japan seems like an expensive country to travel to , the tolls are expensive ."
22346,"it is an expensive country , but travel is very good there . air travel is a bit pricey , but the trains are great . you dont need a car ."
22347,"yeah they are great , i heard the dutch are creating a really fast commuter bus"
22348,"i think that commuting is an unpleasant fact of life , so making it faster is great ."
22349,"i agree i hate long commute times , it feels like a waste of time so a bus that travels at 160 mph is the solution to that"
22350,"yeah , as long as it is safe . that is quite fast , and i would want a really good seat belt . lol"
22351,yeah a seat belt and a couple of airbags just in case lol doesnt look like a safe way to travel
22352,i suppose the bus would have its own lane on the freeway ? i would not want other cars around .
22353,i guess its a private lane but still there can always be animals or even reckless people and then accidents happen .
22354,"yes , that is true . i guess they would have to plan that pretty carefullly to prevent anything from getting in the way of the bus ."
22355,"yeah i guess so , creating a tranportation service like that one requires a lot of planning"
22356,"it is important though . people need to get to work and get home faster . too much time is spent on the road . anyway , great chat !"
22357,"i agree , that can generate a lot of resources , it was great chatting i agree have a nice day ."
22358,i enjoyed chatting too ! have a great day !
22359,thanks for all the cool facts bye .
22360,"hi , have you ever seen adrift ?"
22361,i havent what about you ? it sounds like a good film .
22362,i have not seen it but the critic does not like it . what do they know . . .
22363,"i guess critics often have mixed opinions , the movie came out in 2013 right ?"
22364,"i am not sure . i know all is lost did , which she prefers over adrift ."
22365,yeah did you watch solo : a star wars story ?
22366,i did . i thought it was good but i know it got panned . did you see it ?
22367,"i did watch that one i thought it was good as well , im excited for the second part , it was directed by ron howard ."
22368,al pacino turned down the role . can you imagine him playing han solo ?
22369,"i can't harrison ford really nailed the role , i wonder if we will ever see him on star wars again , he did die in one of the last movies and that was sad ."
22370,yeah . that was shocking and sad . i did not see it coming
22371,"it was a sad day , so the franchise was bought by disney , i hope they can make the franchise great again , include more jedis in the movies make prequels to the stories ."
22372,i feel like disney has cranked out more films than i would like . i want them to be every few years so that they are more special . i think they will be watered down at this rate . what do you think ?
22373,"i think that as well , i guess we will tell soon enough , did you watch the movie deadpool 2 ?"
22374,i did . did you see it ?
22375,"i loved that movie , its one of my favorite movies , deadpool is a badass so funny how reynolds is also the voice of the mystery villain ."
22376,i did not know that . that's interesting !
22377,yeah deadpool is also the highest grossing r rated film with a different director than james cameron or lucas
22378,i had no idea . i would have guessed there was another film that made more !
22379,and another cool fact is that the video game actually cost more money than the deadpool movie
22380,it did ! i had no idea ! nice chatting with you !
22381,do you know that taylor swift is being sued ?
22382,i have heard that ! it's about her lyrics in her album shake it off . . .
22383,"to me , the two songs' choruses are different ."
22384,exactly ! i think so too . besides that copyright does not protect the use of phrases
22385,i agree . i did not know that taylor was born in pennsylvania . i thought she was born in tennessee .
22386,she was ? i didn't know that . and it's funny taylor once released 8 seconds of white noise and topped the canadian charts !
22387,i heard about it . it was amazing .
22388,i didn't know about it lol . . . . swift is one of the bestselling music artists of all time
22389,i did not know about it . do you like her song shake it off ? my 5year granddaughter likes it a lot .
22390,"i think it's really an upbeat song too , my 2 youngest granddaughters go crazy lol they love taylor swift ."
22391,i did not notice who she was until kanye west interrupted her when she was accepting a music award .
22392,"i remember that , he's not a favorite person of mine lol . . . . . . kanye did an snl skit mocking himself over that incident ."
22393,perhaps he realized now how ridiculous he was when he did that .
22394,true ! i hope so but he has done it to more than taylor throughout the years . i had to laugh but do you know taylor walks backwards a lot to keep from getting her picture taken ? i think i would wear a face mask lol
22395,does she hate to have her pictures taken ?
22396,she doesn't like publicity unless it is under her terms . . . . she even removed her music from spotify because she doesn't want anyone listening to her music for free . she is one of the wealthiest singers in history .
22397,"well , artists need to be paid . i thought she had the disagreement with apple co . not spotify ."
22398,probably both lol . . . i agree with her but why not advertise your music on the radio ?
22399,why the radio ? how about social media or you tube instead ?
22400,"true , but i am not sure how she advertises but spotify is just a radio app ."
22401,"i see . do singers still use physical albums , collections of audio recording , to sell the majority of their songs ?"
22402,"yes , you can buy their albums on cd or purchase a single song ."
22403,i have to run . it was nice talking to you .
22404,"hi there , do you enjoy music ?"
22405,"sure , i do . i like all kind of music . i'm fond of the beatles . they have the best selling album of the 2000s"
22406,nice . i like linkin park and their album seems to be the best selling album of the century
22407,that is cool ! i like them too ! did you ever play sonic the hedgehog ?
22408,no i did not actually . but heard it was supposed to be a member of a rock band
22409,"yeah , i guess that explains his funky looks ! if you became a famous rock star , would you keep your old job ?"
22410,hmm probably not . oh and he was supposed to have a girlfriend by the name of maddona who was a blonde
22411,"haha , that is funny ! viktor tsoi is the biggest rock star in russian history but still kept his job in the boiler room of his apartment ."
22412,"nice , he must have enjoyed that . do you know which is the stare rock song for oklahoma ?"
22413,i have heard it is by the flaming lips but i don't think i know it .
22414,yeah it is the song do you realize .
22415,the band whitesnake has had over 50 members in its history . seems quite confusing . the list has its own wikipedia page .
22416,wow that is a long list of people . do you know who wrote the beatles song come together ?
22417,i heard it was for a political campaign .
22418,yeah for the california governor timothy leary in 1969
22419,"i guess they are still talking about and analyzing the song imagine because it's almost the 50th anniversary . yoko ono celebrated early with ' imagine john yoko ' , a detailed study of the album and other things ."
22420,wow cool . did you know ringo starr was illiterate for most of the chuldhood ?
22421,interesting ! was there a reason for that ? in this study of imagine they interviewed people who are still with us but also combed through interviews of people like john lennon . he said that when he was saying ' imagine no religion ' it was meant to advocate the freedom to believe or not to believe in any religion . i thought that was interesting .
22422,"it sounds very interesting indeed . maybe i should check that out . on the other hand , none of them knew how to read music"
22423,"that is surprising ! they seemed so . . . well , musical ! maybe they didn't have the patience for learning to read music . lennon only liked to run through songs two or three times . after that , if the song wasn't right on take two ro three , then he would just be done ."
22424,"wow , i guess he had an ear for good music and just rejected other stuff . super chatting with you today ."
22425,"hello , are you a fan of rock music ?"
22426,yes . but i am kind of dated . i like aerosmith an queen . i am from oklahoma and did not know the state rock song is ' do you realize ? ' by the flaming lips .
22427,"that's fair ! after all rock has been around since the 50s and mainly draws roots from the 1940s , its fair to say the whole genre is dated to an extent ."
22428,good point . chicago djs tricked their listeners by playing a hanson song without revealing it to the listeners and it became highly requested .
22429,"i guess that shows it's still popular today ! i think even in modern times , one of the most famous russians was viktor tsoi , the rock artist . although he lived humbly , and kept a job in the boiler room of his apartment even after becoming famous ."
22430,that is an unusual career choice for a wealthy person . sonic the hedgehog was originally supposed to be a member of a rock band .
22431,"oh yeah , and i believe the plan was to give him a blond girlfriend named madonna too ! guess they really wanted to go all out with the music aspect ."
22432,we have a pastor whose wife is named madonna . when i first met him i asked what it was like to be married to madonna . rock music is usually in 4 or 4 time which gives it that driving beat .
22433,"ahah that's funny , maybe he was the real inspiration for sonic . yeah rock certainly seems timeless and like it isn't changing a whole lot , the band whitesnake has had over 50 members throughout its lifetime ."
22434,"that is a lot of turnover ! most rock is about romance , but there are some tunes about political or social issues ."
22435,and i know the beatles were one of the most influential bands in terms of covering a wide range of topics . they had the song ' come together ' which was actually for timothy leary's governor campaign .
22436,their music ' book ' is fantastic ! they were formed in 1960 .
22437,"and yet somehow their music has been timeless , it was even the best selling album of the 2000's !"
22438,that is consistent with their book being fantastic . my wife is a talented musician and says that almost all of the songs have been done better by someone else than by the beatles . ringo starr was illiterate for most of his childhood .
22439,"that's surprising although literacy doesn't necessarily mean musical talent ! in fact i think that goes for all of them , i don't think any of the beatles could read music !"
22440,i hadn't heard that . i wonder how lennon and mccartney wrote their songs ?
22441,"i wonder too ! it doesn't seem like they adapted well to entertainment life beyond making music to be honest , like they stopped touring because their amplification system couldn't drown out their screaming crowds !"
22442,that is incredible ! i have been in front of speakers that undoubtedly harmed my hearing permanently . maybe it was just before better technology improved the amplification technology .
22443,"i'm sure it was ! i wonder how modern tours are for artists that release new albums . like there were two twins that released a rap album when they were 100 years old , i bet the noise would be hard to manage no matter what the technology ."
22444,"lps were old technology but it is now becoming popular again . mp3 is modern , but the quality of sound is not as good ."
22445,"definitely , but i think it's prioritized more than anything , well mp3 and cd formats , because i think the audio cassette has sort of faded out by now ."
22446,the new formats are simpler and easier to maintain . nice chat .
22447,the beetles are one of my favorite bands i love mccartney do you ?
22448,hi ! i love the beatles ! i had all of their albums !
22449,they were great . its amazing that none of them could read music
22450,"i have heard that about the beatles , pretty amazing ! they also have the best selling album of the 2000's !"
22451,that is crazy since they formed back in 1960
22452,"yes , the beatles have been around a long time . they some of the best rock music ever , and so many great albums ."
22453,yes and ringo starr was illiterate for most of his childhood due to tuberculosis . amazing he became so successful
22454,"exactly ! the beatles are so amazing . in 1963 is when their popularity came as as beatlemania , people went crazy !"
22455,"yes rock music had started taking off in the 1950s , and became a lot of different styles in the 1960s"
22456,"definitely , so amazing . do you like other rock music ? i like a lot of the older rock music albums like pink floyds dark side of the moon , great rock music back then ."
22457,dark side of the moon was an amazing album . i did not know until recently that oklahoma had a state song
22458,oh yeah ? what is their state song ? was it sang by flamingo lips rock band ?
22459,it is the song is do you realize ?
22460,"oh , cool ! i didn't know that . also interesting that the rock band whitesnake had over 50 band memebers throughout their history , wow that is a lot !"
22461,wow ! they must have been hard to get along with changing members so much . i am surprised that the biggest rock star in russian history kept his job working in the boiler room
22462,"right ? wow , i wonder why he kept that job if he was a big rock star ? i would run from that lol . maybe they didn't have a lot of albums ."
22463,that is funny . there are two identical twins from japan who released their first album at 100 years old . not sure how long their career will be !
22464,"oh my ! good for them ! most people never get to have their album known , much less at that age !"
22465,yes . the first albums were released in the early 20th century they might have been around for them !
22466,"i am sure they were ! well , the history of rock music is really interesting , i am glad i had the album collection i had back in the day of rock music , especially the beatle's !"
22467,yes . i had original lps then cassettes and dvds . times have changed .
22468,"hello , do you like music ?"
22469,sure ! i like many kinds of music ! what about you ?
22470,"me too , i love rock , that is my favorite genre"
22471,rocks is great ! i like pop too . do you have a favorite group or album ?
22472,i like many but i admire the beatles because many musicians today have influence from them
22473,"i think the beatles were the key to a lot of today's music . they really changed how rock was structured . they stopped touring toward the end . no point , really ."
22474,i totally agree with you . did you know that come together was written for a political campaign ?
22475,"come together ? yes , i know the song . what campaign ?"
22476,it was for a man named timothy leary that was running for governor of california
22477,"timothy leary ? the lsd guy ? hm . well , i guess he had a cool song for his campaign ."
22478,the same ! that was back in 1969
22479,"well , maybe at the time tim leary seemed like a reasonable candidate to the beatles . they liked to trip on lsd . i think their music was fine without the heavy substances ."
22480,"it is a great song , did you know none of the 4 beatles could read music ?"
22481,that makes sense . they came from humble beginnings . they learned everything by ear . i don't think they missed much by not reading music .
22482,they are so creative ! ! i would have wanted to watch them live but they stopped touring
22483,i think they couldn't hear themselves play . people just screamed the whole time . they probably got pretty bad at performing too . better to stick to the studio
22484,yes it was too much too overwhelming and probably they needed better amplifiers but that is what technology allowed at the time
22485,"the times have changed , but the beatles remain popular . perennial favorites ."
22486,"beatlmania remains . they were excellent in rock and roll but they went beyond experimenting with indian music , hard rock and more ! ! they rock"
22487,i think that is the essence of great music . willingness to explore and experiment with other genres and ideas and make them your own .
22488,they are from the 60' but they had the best selling album of the 2000's
22489,"i think they will have the best selling albums in the next century , too ! so many bands now just can't compare ! well , i enjoyed chatting !"
22490,i could go on talking about music for days ! yes gave a good one
22491,are you a fan of horror films ?
22492,not really . i don't like jumping out of my seat ! i liked inception . that was originally stupposed to be a horror film .
22493,is that the one with leo ?
22494,"that's right ! on the other hand , those filming the exorcist didn't think it would be considered a horror film ."
22495,"interesting , i didn't know that . apparently you can burn 180 calories watching a horror film ."
22496,"not sure with all the buttery popcorn i eat , haha !"
22497,"hilarious , yeah . i'm not so sure that is true either . lol"
22498,et originally was supposed to be a horror film too . i can't imagine ! i loved it when i was little .
22499,i can believe that . i could see that being designed to be scary .
22500,i guess he's a little creepy . i loved et though and thought he was adordable
22501,i also know that mnm passed on them for marketing .
22502,interesting ! i once watched an anime film that was supposed to be horror but it was just funny . do you like anime ?
22503,"not really , i can't honestly say i've even seen one ."
22504,but i presume you've seen the lion king ? it has been accused of copying an anime series .
22505,"no , actually i haven't seen it . but was it ?"
22506,"yeah , disney's lion king was accused to copying the white lion ."
22507,interesting . do you like fish ?
22508,i like to view them at aquariums .
22509,"apparently seahorse are the only fish to have a neck , what about an eel ?"
22510,interesting ! i once had a goldfish that lived over ten years . the oldest goldfish was 43 years old though .
22511,"wow , that is pretty old . well , nice chatting with you ."
22512,"yeah , nothing compared to the oldest koi fish though , 226 years ! nice chatting with you ."
22513,are you into horror films ?
22514,"no , at least not the slasher type . i like some movies that are labeled ' horror ' . i like feel good movies like ' the miracle season ' or ' a quiet place ' ."
22515,"me too , i think a quiet place was a horror movie wasn't it ?"
22516,"no , it's about pandas for ages 6 plus . it's about them being able to survive in the wild ."
22517,"lol i didn't know that . i think there is a horror movie called a quiet place where they can't talk or they die , don't mess that up at the video store , lol !"
22518,"there may be a horror film with a similar name . yes , that would be an unexpected twist in the story . have you seen the movie ' the miracle season ' ?"
22519,"that is actually about a team in my city i am living in , iowa city right ? about volleyball"
22520,i don't know . i do know it's about kids on a volleyball team dealing with the death of their captain . she died unexpectedly it is said to be wholesome so iowa city would work . . .
22521,"dang , i never knew that at all ! it makes sense why they did so good , so inspirational ! sounds like a horror movie because of the sadness !"
22522,yeah . do you like anime ? i guess ' big fish and begonia ' that has chinese myths and is fantasybased . it sounds weird but interesting .
22523,"i like dragonball z and powerpuff girls , they were great ! do you like it ?"
22524,"i never got into it . i'm sorry , you were right , a quiet place is a horror movie . i hadn't seen either and i got it confused . i have seen the rocky horror picture show ."
22525,"lol , i haven't seen the other one , that one sounds better lol . that is a great one too , did you ever get into any stephen king films ?"
22526,i read some of his stuff it is still scary like ' apt pupil ' . i do like edgar allan poe .
22527,yea apparently stephen king got into horror after thinking bambi was a horror movie
22528,ha . there was a scary fire as i recall . . . i can't believe et was originally going to be a horror film .
22529,that would have been so crazy lol . i am glad it wasn't but i think they could have made it an interesting horror film lol .
22530,did you know jellyfish are 98 percent water ? how can something that can produce such pain be almost all water ?
22531,"right , i don't want to know what they other 2 percent is , lol . did you know there is a type of jelly fish that is immortal"
22532,i've heard that . why does something that can hurt people get that blessing ? why couldn't it be a panda bear ?
22533,"right lol , or my cute dog ! it was so nice chatting with you , you have a great weekend !"
22534,"hello , do you watch anime ? i happen to watch it all the time !"
22535,hi ! i watch it and also know quite a bit about it . i particularly love the powerpuff girls remake the japanese did called powerpuff girls z !
22536,"ah , my favorite is probably no game no life or one punch man . what other animes have you watched ?"
22537,"i actually enjoyed the first anime that was played on adult swim back in 2001 , cowboy bebop !"
22538,"ah , that was a pretty good one . john cena is actually also a fan of anime . i never thought that he was one !"
22539,"i wouldn't either , honestly . but seeing as how anime is classified into numerous genres that targets diverse broad audiences , i don't see how anyone could not like it !"
22540,"i agree , although some people may not like that anime is animated . some might just prefer regular tv shows over animated ones ."
22541,that is a great point ! so did you know mewtwo strikes back was intended to be the series finale of pokemon ? that was a little surprising to me !
22542,"well , there are over 750 episodes of pokemon , dozens of movie and it does not show any signs of slowing down ! i wonder who has time to watch all of those episodes ."
22543,"i know because i certainly don't . ha ! so what other genres do you like ? i also like horror as it's great exercise because watching horror films can burn over 180 calories , surprisingly enough !"
22544,i do not have a favorite genre although i try to stick to fantasy or isekai genres .
22545,"i understand ! you know , if you ever go to watch a horror movie , be sure to check out abstract art right afterwards as they say you'll enjoy it more ."
22546,really ? i wonder which scientist discovered that ! it seems pretty random to me .
22547,"agreed , it most certainly does . i tell you something else crazy , the kid from the shining named danny didn't actually know he was acting in a horror film until years later . it's like , how did he not find out while filming ?"
22548,"wow , it must have been scary then . what if we are also being secretly filmed right now for a different movie ?"
22549,"kind of like fish that don't know they're being filmed . ha ! speaking of fish , can you believe that the only fish that has a neck is a seahorse ?"
22550,really ? there is also a breed of jellyfish that is immortal !
22551,"i need to study that jellyfish breed , then ! ha ! i'd also like to study the black swallower as it can eat prey twice its size and also ten times its weight . how is that possible ? ha !"
22552,"i wonder , although i also wish i could do that too . if i could , i would be dumping sushi into my stomach 24 or 7 !"
22553,ha ! you and me both ! we're more closer to the zebrafish since 84 percent of genes associated with our diseases have counterparts in zebrafishes .
22554,wow . we land mammals all evolved from these fish millions of years ago .
22555,"that's hard to believe , isn't it ? we evolved from gillbearing aquatic craniate animals that don't have limbs with digits . so weird ! well , it was great chatting with you tonight ! take care , friend !"
22556,how's it going ? are you a netflix fan ? i have been subscribing to netflix since it was founded in 1997
22557,"i am a netflix fan , its crazy how the company has grown ."
22558,"yea , they have 137 million subscribers worldwide now , that's amazing"
22559,"that is amazing , and 58 . 46 in the us alone i bet blockbuster is regretting not buying the company when they had the chance ."
22560,"yea blockbuster screwed up , could of bought netflix for 50 million instead they are out of business"
22561,they are indeed specially when netflix is worht 2 billion now and has a ton of subscribers to back that out .
22562,"yep , it's ironic that blockbuster late fees inspired the creation of netflix in the first place"
22563,"it is ironic i guess they were they provoked their own death , amazing what anger can inspire ."
22564,it's funny though now that netflix accounts for 33 percent of bandwith between 9pm12pm that internet providers punish users by throttling
22565,"it is , many of the movies there have excellent ratings on rotten tomatoes , 150 of them even reach 100 percent"
22566,i don't know if i trust rotten tomatoes ratings although i do agree with michael bay's film ratings of 38 percent
22567,"yeah his films are pretty bad , and it might be biased as the company is owned by warner bros"
22568,"yea , i thought about that but i must admit the marvel movies do good on rotten tomatoes while the warner brother's dc movies don't do nearly as well"
22569,"i guess its not biased afterall or atleast in some segments its pretty honest , do you like tom hanks ?"
22570,"yea , tom hanks is one of my favorite actors , a league of their own was a pretty good movie"
22571,"he is one of my favorite actors as well , some of my favorite movies are cast awat and green mile ."
22572,"i never knew he avoided villain type roles , i wonder if he could play a good one"
22573,"i think he would make an excellent villain he is a great actor , did you watch sully ?"
22574,no i haven't gotten around to seeing it but i head he was good in it
22575,"he was , i though it was a pretty great movie and the skills of the pilot , to think the whole movie is based on real life events ."
22576,"tom hanks seem to be good at playing pilots in dramatic situations , like apollo 13"
22577,he was good in that movie you know he always ends his emails with a pun
22578,"lol , i would like to read an email pun from tom hanks . well i gtg , nice talking with you"
22579,i am not a huge wes anderson fan . i think he is into horror films and i dont watch those .
22580,i am not big into animated series
22581,"are you into trivia ? did you know there are 12 different blood types that a dog may have , and dogs can donate blood at dog blood drives"
22582,i love dogs . i have a boston myself
22583,"nice . dogs are not colour blind , but cannot see as many different colours as humans"
22584,they are good at understanding pointing too
22585,"wow , i did not know that . istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for the city's stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles . how kind . . ."
22586,"yes , it is such a good idea . i try to feed mine by hand as well as any local strays near my home"
22587,by hand ? have you ever been bitten ?
22588,a couple of times . dogs are loyal but protective too
22589,i hope you're ok . google prefers dogs to cats . their code of conduct specifically states that they are a dog company . seems like you would work well in google .
22590,do they let employees bring dogs to work ?
22591,"i am not sure . if they did , they would be even better !"
22592,"i wonder if they are friendly to the big mean dogs too , i suspect not"
22593,probably not . the csuite probably can bring dogs but not the entry level jobs .
22594,dogs were among the first animals to be domesticated
22595,huh . . . a physicist published his cat as a coauthor so he could write using first person plural without being criticized .
22596,"silly . i would have done the same but for my dog , i don't think a cat would be a good copublisher . lol"
22597,probably not . . . they would be copy cats !
22598,lol . . . too funny . do you have a favorite breed of dog ?
22599,i love my golden and labs . right now i have a st bernard named sasha . . .
22600,you are very lucky . i love those dogs but no patience for the shedding
22601,"hi , how are you ?"
22602,good how are you ? do you watch netflix ? i love all the selection of shows and join one of the 137 million subscribers worldwide .
22603,i do love netflix . what is your favorite show on there ?
22604,i like the flash and richie rich . what is your favorite ? i wish i would have thought of the idea for netflix because they are worth 2 billion today .
22605,"i know , right . you would be so rich ! i love the flash ! i have an episode from this week that i need to watch or"
22606,"if only i would have been irresponsible and got the 40 late on vhs like reed hastings , maybe i would be the billionaire starting up netflix ."
22607,yeah . i got the late fees but not the multibillion dollar company . i should have thought more about those late fees .
22608,most people like me are watching netflix late at night in the 912 crowd .
22609,"yeah . i think most people watch during that time , don't they ?"
22610,do you agree with rotten tomatoes ratings ? every video game film has not done so well with them .
22611,"i usually look at the ratings before i go to a show , unless it is something i will see regarless , like anchorman 2 . it got terrible scores but i was going to go regardless so i didn't look . what about you ?"
22612,i look at the scores before watching videos . since netflix has about 150 movies with a 100 percent rotten tomatoes rating i trust those are some good movies .
22613,yeah . i wish netflix had a better scoring system . i look at the ratings and usually get disappointed by the higher rated ones . maybe it's my epxectations with the ratings . . .
22614,i'd go with their recommendation for spykids as that is a great movie and very highly rated on rotten tomatoes .
22615,i think my kids watched that . i know my son used to love lavagirl and shrk boy . everytime i came home from work he was watching it . . .
22616,"one of my favorite shows have tom hanks though . he has so many good movies . i remember him starring in splash , big , turner and hooch , the green mile , sully and the list goes on ."
22617,"yes and he was in bossum , sp , buddies . i remember seeing that show on like spoofs . . . i do like tom hanks though . i cannot believe he was the first to play walt disney in mainstream film ."
22618,"he has the highest box office star in earnings , and definitely has earned it !"
22619,yeah . i always love his movies . unlike michael bay who has gotten a 38 percent on rotten tomatoes !
22620,"yes , and of those who weren't satisfied with his movies he was known to have refunded people the money they paid for the ticket ."
22621,wow ! nice chatting with you !
22622,hey there ! do you have a dog or a cat ? or any pets ?
22623,"yea , i have a dog , it's fascinating that they evolved from domesticated wolves"
22624,"yeah ! dog's are definitely ' man's best friend ' . at least in my case ! : , did you know there is a such thing as dog blood drives ? i guess , dogs can be in need of blood donations too !"
22625,i'd imagine it's hard to find blood for dogs since they have 12 different blood types
22626,"yeah ! now that i know about it , i'll look into possibly having my dog donate ! dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing . and i believe that because i just tested it on a cat and she didn't care ! haha"
22627,cats probably understand but ignore people . in russia they have a tomb of the unknow dog in honor of canine used in research
22628,"aw that's so sad . if i had my way , we would only research on willing humans ."
22629,yea it's pretty unfortunate . it's pretty cool that dogs can learn over a thousand words
22630,"oh yeah , that is amazing ! my dog is so spoiled , she doesn't even know the word ' no ! ' very well . haha . interesting that google prefers dogs over cats . their code of conduct specifically states that they are a dog company . i like cats and dogs , personally . i'm not a ' giraffe ' person . i like all animals ."
22631,yea both are cool . in moscow some dogs even ride the subway
22632,"neat ! dogs are so smart or at least some of them can be ! in istanbul they have a vending machine that the cities stray dogs can get food and water out of , in exchange for plastic bottles ! that solves to problems ! hungry and thirsty dogs and plastic bottle waste !"
22633,apparently dogs have eureka moment to when solving problems for rewards
22634,"aw , that's adorable ! dogs are so cute ! hard to believe they've sent live dogs out into space , alone ! that's so mean . humans should always be nice to dogs . they have helped us with many things , since their domestication over many millennia ."
22635,yea . what's crazy is over 86000 people visit the er from tripping or falling over a dog or cat
22636,"oh wow ! i've tripped over both ! haha ! not at the same time though . haha ! woah , the first cloned pet was a cat , named copy cat ! haha , how creative !"
22637,"lol . did you know there hasn't been a species of cat that has gone extinct in 10 , 000 years ?"
22638,wow ! no i didn't know that ! i doubt it will be that way for long . i've heard a lot recently about large cat species that are struggling .
22639,yea that is unfortunate . it's pretty cool that the andrson house bed and breakfast offered a free cat companion
22640,"yeah , that's nice of them giving animals a home and making their visitors happy at the same time ! theodore roosevelt had over 20 pets , including a bear and a hyena ! his house must have been a dangerous place to visit ! haha"
22641,"that's crazy , apparently some trantulas keep frogs as pets to protect their eggs from ants"
22642,crazy ! an animal keeping a pet is the coolest thing i've learned today for sure ! and a spider keeping a frog nonetheless !
22643,"yea that is pretty cool , well it was nice chatting with you"
22644,i had no idea dogs could have 12 different blood types . i wonder what types my dogs are .
22645,me neither . i have a friend whose dog donates blood at a dog hospital when they need it .
22646,i didn't even know that was an option for dogs to donate blood . dogs seem to act more and more like humans .
22647,"yes . dogsand elephants even understand what pointing is and how to interpret it . ever point over to where you threw the ball , and your dog runs right over there ? pretty cool !"
22648,"yes . my dog is very smart . they can even tell the color of the ball , too . they aren't color blind like many people think ."
22649,"i don't think that they can see orange , or that the colors look quite the same to them as they do to us , but i agree . funny that google is partial to dogs in their business rather than cats ."
22650,i know . i wonder if more people google things about dogs than cats . i wonder if youtube is more partial to dogs .
22651,"i don't know . do you think it is true that there are more tigers living as pets in the usa , then living wild in asia ? wow ! i read that . . . ."
22652,i don't know . that seems to be an odd choice for a pet . i wonder why there are fewer tigers in asia .
22653,"threatened habitat and poaching . there used to be many pet tigers in vegas and in california , where the regs are less strict about keeping exotic pets ."
22654,"i guess the us has a history of having exotic animals as pets , since theodore roosevelt had a bear and a hyena as pets ."
22655,"yes , he was quite the outdoorsman . also , there are alot of wildlife sanctuaries with big cats across the country that cannot go in to zoos , so that is wonderful if they are treated humanely ."
22656,i wonder how people keep the cats under control . do you remember the incident with penn and teller ?
22657,"absolutely . yes , it's tough , they are not meant to be domesticated . same with the orcas at sea world . cats have been around for 9000 years ."
22658,"i used to really like cats , but i don't care for the litter box . also , i saw on a documentary that house cats are the number one predator in the world ."
22659,"i am an absolute dog person . i have 2 right now who are like my children . it is a novel idea that in istanbul , they feed stray dogs by trading recycled plastic bottles for food and water from vending machines ."
22660,"that's a great idea . i am a dog person , too . i have two dogs . i wish we had dog water vending machines in our parks ."
22661,me too . and more efficient ways to help feed and house all the dogs that end up in shelters .
22662,we adopted one of our dogs from a shelter . my spouse refers to it as ' doggy jail . '
22663,"mine are both shelter dogs too . there are too many breeders out there trying to make big bucks , when shelter dogs are being euthanized every day . it is so sad . ."
22664,"people think that shelters are ' no kill , ' but that isn't necessarily true . we went back to our shelter several times for two weeks to make sure we were able to adopt our little girl dog ."
22665,cool ! it has been lovely chatting with you . take care of your furry family !
22666,"you , too ! happy new year to you and your fur friends , too !"
22667,happy new year !
22668,do you enjoy netflix ?
22669,"i do , i like the service , what about you ?"
22670,it's definitely one of my major life necessities . but i still remember the blockbuster days . did you know that the inventor of netflix was inspired to start the business when he accumulated a 40 late fee on a vhs ?
22671,"i didnt know that but that will inspire anyone 40 is just an excessive fee , i could buy two movies for that price"
22672,or one dvd back in the old days haha ! did you know that blockbuster could have bought netflix back when it was small too and never did
22673,yeah they had the chance to buy the company for 50 million and now its worth a lot more than that
22674,"i guess they couldn't see the change coming , but netflix probably didn't either really . most of their business is streaming movies and it definitely didn't start out with that as the focus ."
22675,well netflix also has the dvd renting option the spend a lot more in postage than on bandwidth
22676,i wonder if many people even use that option anymore . i'm too bad at planning what i want to watch next and got rid of that service pretty early on
22677,"you can always subscribe again , interesting how with youtube , netflix makes up half of the internet traffic in north america"
22678,i know ! isn't that shocking ! i would never have expected it to be so impactful but that makes a lot of sense . i've also read that during the evenings netflix accounts for 33 percent of all bandwidth use in north america . clearly all any of us do is stay in and watch netflix these days haha
22679,"it is shocking , the company has grown a lot over the years , do you like the company rotten tomatoes ?"
22680,"i do , although i often watch movies even after i see they've received a low rating on there . i like making my own decisions sometimes , especially since i know that rotten tomatoes is owned by warner bros"
22681,"yeah , that can make the site a bit biased , well there are 150 movies with a 100 percent rating on rotten tomatoes available in netflix , they must be pretty good"
22682,"rotten tomatoes must be a great resource to a place like netflix , when they're deciding which movies to add"
22683,"yeah i bet it is a great tool , do you agree with michael's bay's average rating , 38 percent out of 100 percent"
22684,"i guess it depends on what you're looking for in a movie , michael bay movies are all hot girls and explosions so if you're looking for that and he delivers i guess your rating would be higher than 38 percent right ?"
22685,"it would , maybe a 60 percent he does have decent movies , i liked transformers at least the first and second movies"
22686,yes me too ! although i don't know if i've ever watched a michael bay movie outside of a theater . i wonder if they translate to being streamed on netflix and a smaller screen ?
22687,"could be , thats a good thing to wonder about , so do you have a favorite actor ? mine is tom hanks"
22688,"i don't think i do , tom hanks is a great choice though . and i love that now that he's rich and powerful he refuses to play bad guys"
22689,i guess an actor like him can refuse any role and still come on top anyway its been great chatting with you
22690,haha you're right . nice talking with you !
22691,"thanks a lot for the chat , it had a lot of fun bye ."
22692,are you interested in fashion week at all ?
22693,"to be honest , i don't pay attention to fashion trends that much . i just wear comfortable clothes as much as possible ."
22694,"me too , i wear sustainable clothing or recyled clothes . better for the planet ."
22695,"that's a good idea . i tend to dress very plainly , but with cheaper clothes . apparently , mark zuckerberg's plain grey shirts cost 300 to 400 !"
22696,"wow ! i don't need a 300 shirt , even if i am rich , lol"
22697,right ? but wearing expensive clothes isn't anything new since the greeks used to wear asbestos that used to cost as much as gold
22698,"asbestos , huh ? no wonder they are all dead . i'm just saying . . . . . . ."
22699,"yeah people did all sorts of crazy stuff back in the day . they used to wash clothes on old faithful too , like an explosive washing machine ."
22700,"i'll bet they ended up losing a lot of clothes . also , who knew pilgrims wore colorful clothing ? they only wore black for special occasions , i just found out ."
22701,"i didn't know about that , i only ever see pilgrim pictures in thanksgiving so i guess that makes sense . did you know that tshirts were invented in 1904 for bachelors who didn't know how to sew ."
22702,"i just see the image of pilgrims dressed in black and white , with those big ole buckles on the hats and shoes ."
22703,"same here , usually they're eating some turkey with some native american tribe ."
22704,"and learning from said native americans how not to starve come winter , but i digress . . . . ."
22705,"the native americans didn't start dressing like the pilgrims though , unlike an african tribe that still wears victorian clothes in the style of german colonizers ."
22706,"man , those colonizers were bad news . . . . . . that was a cool fact about the origin of the tshirt , btw"
22707,"yeah they were bad news , but at least the tribe kind of made it their own style ."
22708,"i would trade land rights , and liberty over style any day , but i see your point ."
22709,"fashion is one way people can express themselves , and what people wear can give you an idea of their culture and their society ."
22710,"i totally agree . fashion can speak for an entire culture or generation . it expresses creativity , passion , individualism , etc"
22711,definitely . it's been nice talking to ya .
22712,you too . take care !
22713,thanks
22714,how uptodate are you on the new york fashion scene ?
22715,"can't say i know too much about it , i do know that greeks made asbestos clothing which sounds super unhealthy"
22716,"knowing what we know today , it undoubtable was . it seems like major couture brands are under new leadership . carolina herrera transferred the reins of her fashion empire to wes gordon ."
22717,"thats interesting , i love how a man wore over 60 clothing items on his person in order to avoid a baggage charge , i think thats hilarious"
22718,"i have overstuffed my carryon , but have not tried that approach . it seems like not all the transitions in couture fashion are well received . wes gordon received a mixed score card . others such as kate spade endure in the make of its founder ."
22719,"ya i remember in the wolf of wall street with the steve madden fiasco , i guess it is common for the founders to get in trouble with clothing brands that they own , have you seen that movie ?"
22720,no i have not . do you know how fashion and style experts look to see if your clothes are tailored or offtherack ? by looking for collar gaps .
22721,"hmm that is interesting , i like that there is an african tribe that wears clothes of the victorian era still , that's what the german occupiers wore when they first arrived , i want to see that haha"
22722,"the orgin of clothing customs is alway intriguing . it seems that history shows the pilgrims to be wearing black . however , they wore full color clothing ; black was for special occasions ."
22723,"ah wow i didn't know that , i always pictured them wearing their traditional pilgrim stuff , i guess it depends on the occasion , like how at billly mays funeral , the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khaki pants instead of the traditional black suits"
22724,"to me , people's taste in clothes will always be unexplainable . like the movie ' the emperor's new clothes ' . not only was the movie bad , but its soundtrack was wretched ."
22725,"ah i haven't seen that movie , i did like michael jackson's taste in clothes , i never knew that he helped write the soundtrack for sonic 3 that is a great game"
22726,i did not know that . did you know spielberg played the clarinet on the ' jaw's ' soundtrack ?
22727,"haha i didn't know that , that is still a great movie , did you know the plain grey shirt that mark zuckerburg wears is worth several hundred dollars per shirt ? like what brand is that"
22728,"i don't think i could ever spend that much on a shirt , or any article of clothing . considering his hawaiian estate , i am surprised i never see him in an aloha shirt ."
22729,"haha ya , also wild that the tshirt was invented in 1904 , it seems so obvious but that was when it first appeared"
22730,"and , back then , a tee shirt was purely an undergarment . today it is that an more . we even have designer tees that go with a blazer jacket . i guess we could call it clothing evolution ."
22731,"speaking of evolution , did you know the princess bride's soundtrack was composed by the lead singer of dire straits ? like how could he be so good at so many things"
22732,"mark knopfler is my favorite guitarist and a truly gifted musician . while i did not know that , it does not surprise me . one of my favorite soundtracks is the venture's original batman . did you know each track title is the scientific genus or family name of a bat ?"
22733,"no i didn't know that , that is a great movie though , do you like that batman movie or the tim burton 1989 batman movie ?"
22734,"it was one of the better remakes with ' bat computer ' . speaking of computers , did you know apple had its own shortlived clothing line in 1986 ?"
22735,"no i didn't know that , i wonder if those clothes are worth money ? like is it just big apple logos on everything ?"
22736,"hello , are you interested at all in clothing information ?"
22737,"yea , i never knew pilgrim clothing actually had many colors , i guess they had a wild side after all"
22738,"yeah that's surprising right ? i always saw them in books dressed fully in black , it's funny to think that was only for special occasions , like the opposite of how we do now ."
22739,"yea , it's pretty crazy that apple had a clothing line in 1986 too . i wonder how much those original clothing is worth now"
22740,"i wonder if you can still find them ! there's a store in alabama that sells unclaimed baggage , maybe there's some apple clothing there ."
22741,i wonder if they sell any rip curl clothes that are made in north korea in that store
22742,"rip curl is an interesting brand too ! they say their clothes are from north korea but i believe the label says ' made in china ' , it definitely takes away from the novelty ."
22743,"i thought it was illegal to sell items made in north korea in the us , i wonder how rip curl gets around that"
22744,"oh that's definitely true , i guess since it's clearly not truly from there it's ok . the culture around clothing is interesting , like people can tell if your clothes are tailored or not based on if there are collar gaps ."
22745,"lol , i must have not met a lot of style aficionados because no one has mentioned my collar gaps to me"
22746,"ahah well i think you can look fashionable without going that far . i like polo shirts , they were actually invented by famous tennis player rene lacoste ."
22747,interesting . at billy may's funeral the pallbearers wore his bule shirt and khaki style oufit
22748,"that's a sweet gesture , it seems strange but you can see why they did that . similarly , in hawaii , business and office attire is an aloha shirt , not a suit and tie like it is in the united states ."
22749,i wish i could go into my job in an alhoa shirt like they do in hawaii
22750,"oh definitely , instead we deal with a lot more strictness . like did you know button down and button up refer to different styles ? depending on if the collor tips fasten to the shirt ."
22751,"no , i thought button down and button up referred to the same shirt style lol"
22752,yeah it's definitely too fancy for me regardless . are you interested in soundtracks as well ?
22753,"yea , o brother where art thou ? is a great soundtrack and it has been certified 8 times platinum"
22754,i haven't heard it but i wonder if it's been translated to other languages too ! like the tarzan soundtrack was so big phil collins recorded it in 5 different languages .
22755,it's kinda funny phil collins recorded his songs in 5 different language yet the tarzan movie didn't do good at the box office
22756,wow i didn't know it did poor at the box office ? i wonder if batman begins did bad as well . i know each of the song titles on the soundtrack for that movie is actually named after a genus or family of bat .
22757,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
22758,hey there ! do you have any pets ? how about a hyena like roosevelt had ?
22759,yea i'd love to have a bear and over 20 pets like teddy did
22760,"if you were in boulder , you wouldn't ' have ' them , but rather be their guardian . now isn't that a cool concept ?"
22761,that's pretty cool . it's unfortunate there are more pet tigers in the us than wild ones in asia
22762,"yeah that is pretty sad . maybe we should start a tiger cafe to spread awareness ! like the ones they have for cats in japan , you know ."
22763,they have a cat cafe near my house so i don't have to take a trip to japan
22764,"woah , really ? that's awesome ! do you get to interact with the cats there ?"
22765,yea there's like 10 cats just hanging around and you pay 10 for an hour with them
22766,so cool . though personally i've always been a dog person just like google is .
22767,"i like dogs cool , it's pretty cool istanbul has a vending machine that feeds stray dogs"
22768,that's how it should be in all cities ! do you think it took the dogs long to figure out how to recycle there ?
22769,"i don't know , dogs are pretty smart , they can instinctively understand pointing"
22770,"they're so smart , they should rule over us . i vote to elect dogs as our overlords . they'd do much better than that cat they've got for mayor in alaska ."
22771,"that's pretty cool , it spent most of its time in office sleeping since a cat sleeps for 10 years in the first 15 years of life"
22772,"they are some sleepy things , aren't they ? though apparently one cat woke up long enough to help write a physics paper !"
22773,that's pretty cool . the cat in godfather 1 was a stray cat found on set
22774,"lucky kitty . would you ever consider cloning your pets ? i know there's a service that does it for dogs , and they've already cloned at least one cat ."
22775,no i'm not into the whole idea of pet cloning
22776,"ah , i understand that . it is kinda creepy , just how there are more pets in japan than there are young kids ."
22777,maybe they can just clone the blood since dogs have 12 different blood types
22778,"hmm , you may be on to something there . but we'll have to wait and see i guess . in the meantime , i've got to go walk my dogs ."
22779,have a nice day
22780,hi ! have you heard of the song 'small bump' by ed sheeran ?
22781,i have no until now . it appears it has been in some the news due to irish antiabortion campaigners started using it . have you heard it ?
22782,i really enjoy ed sheeran's music but have not heard of that song either before . do you know what sheeran's original intentions were for that song since he voiced he didn't approve of the antiabortion usage .
22783,"it was about a friend who had a miscarriage which is a nice thing to do . what do you think about people using stuff with permissions , such as songs , ?"
22784,"oh ok , that's very nice of him . all his songs are really good and catchy , i'll have to youtube it later . well , there's two ways of looking at it , if i were famous , then i wouldn't want people using my songs without permission because i could get paid for it . but , if i weren't famous , then i'd want people to use my song , because then if it went viral , i could be famous haha . what do you think ?"
22785,i agree . however if you are promoting something you need to get permissions like reagan using bruce springsteen's song born in the usa . do you know other musicians that have spoken out ?
22786,i can't recall of any other musicians who have spoken out about that issue . i'd imagine eminem may be a potential candidate since he writes such personal songs . eminem also happens to be one of sheeran's biggest musical influences ! what are yours ?
22787,i like eminem as well . that influence drove ed to win lots of awards such as ivor novello award for best song musically and lyrically . do you know of any other awards he won ?
22788,"i'm sure there must be a grammy to that list of awards sheeran has won . it's amazing how generous he is by giving away songs to other artists , like justin bieber's hit , ' love yourself ' was written by sheeran but since he didn't think it fit in with his album , he passed it off to bieber !"
22789,ed is very talented when it comes to music . he has a better vocal range than freddie mercury . can you sing ?
22790,"wow , that's impressive , i was reminded by freddie mercury with the recent film biography about him . i can sing , but not in public haha . can you ? i think my lack of skill for singing has something to do with how humans have evolved , we've come to lose our body hair as recently as 240k years ago !"
22791,i will pass on the singing part . too bad my voice won'f fix itself like a rib can . humans will regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 23 months of having it surgically shortened . have you had surgery at all ?
22792,"wow , that's insane , ribs can grow back ? ! i bet that's painful but what's more painful is the screeching sound of nails scratching on the chalkboard , does that sound fall in the frequency that causes fear in humans ?"
22793,"yikes , i can imagine it does . that might be due to our dna . humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity around 50000 years ago . i sure this was picked up then . . . haha"
22794,thats' been a long time ! what benefit do you think there is if humans were able to synthesize our own vitamin c like animals and plants do ? the only thing i can think of is probably savings on orange juice purchases .
22795,i did not know that . did you know that humans are adapted for persistence hunting making them among the best distance runners among all running animals ? hard to imagine all animals .
22796,"humans being adapted for distance runners ? wow , i'm really out of shape then and need to start hitting the gym because if i run even for one minute straight , i start panting like crazy . how about yourself ?"
22797,i'm trying to get back in shape . i assume are earlier ancestors we in decent shape since all they could do was walk around and try to survive . they would have been called hominins . do you follow the history of humans ?
22798,"i don't follow much history about humans but i do follow politics and the colors red and blue used to signify republicans and democrats have only been in use since the 2000s , i thought it existed forever ! when do you think the animals were introduced ?"
22799,i would imagine back in 1957 when truman refused to be photographed while riding a dumbo ride so he wouldn't be associated with republicans .
22800,i think you may have a great point but could be earlier than that since there hasn't been a us president who wasn't a republican or democrat since the 1850s !
22801,"hello there , i hope you are doing well . are you a fan of ed sheeran ?"
22802,"i like some of his songs , some not so much . how about you ?"
22803,"not too much , but i do think he is very talented . do you hear that antiabortion campaigners have used one of his songs to advocate for their own cause ?"
22804,yes and it was actually a miscarriage .
22805,yeah sounds like he wrote it about a friend who had one . did you know bruce springsteen once objected to someone using one of his songs ?
22806,"yes i wonder why they cannot sue them to stop using them , but i guess they can be used as longs as there is no financial gain ?"
22807,"yeah you might be right , i know if i was an artist i wouldn't like it if a politician used it for their campaign ."
22808,its interesting that the republican party in the 1800's is more like the democrats of today .
22809,"that is funny , did you know that every president with a beard has been republican ?"
22810,or how about democrat or republican presidents since 1853 . where is the other parties ?
22811,"yeah to not have a president outside of those two parties is not cool . we need to come together and change that , have more than those options and not feel like you are throwing away a vote ."
22812,i vote third party in the last presidential elections because i didn't like either candidate . i didnt feel like i was wasting my vote .
22813,"i voted the same myself in the last , i think that is just how the majority of people think ."
22814,how about ed sheeran having a better vocal range than freddie mercury or giving a hit song to justin bieber .
22815,yeah that is pretty wild to think about . i guess he also claims eminem is a huge influence .
22816,i wonder why eminem would be an influence . i would have never guest that .
22817,"i know right , i thought the same thing . their musical styles are so different ."
22818,i guess creative types get their inspiration from many different areas so maybe its not so weird after all .
22819,"that is true . did you know he wrote and recorded the song i see fire , for the movie the hobbit , in one day , that is impressive ."
22820,i once saw a documentary on him doing his shows . he seemed to have limitless energy so i can see that happening .
22821,"that must have been pretty interesting . well it was nice talking with you , i hope you enjoy the rest of the day ."
22822,"good morning ! call me crazy but , ed sheeran's song ' small bump ' has some rather unusual lyrics for a man to sing . at 4 months there's really no bump ."
22823,that is pretty weird . i don't think i've heard that one . ed sheeran considers eminem as one of his biggest musical influences . i don't think they sound too similar . .
22824,"i can't say i'd recognize him in a lineup or that one particular song of his i could pinpoint as his . i would however recognize eminem and his work haha . rumor has it sheeran has a better vocal range than freddie mercury . that's a bold comparison , don't ya think ?"
22825,that's definitely a little bold . i'm not sure i've heard anything that good from him . did you know he gave one of his songs to justin bieber ?
22826,"no , i did not . justin bieber i've always considered a singer who appeals to tween girls and single crazy cat ladies , not a legitimate musician . . . same with sheeran . it's amazing what will sell to some demographics ."
22827,"yeah , that's true . did you know you can regrow part of your rib ?"
22828,no ! now i wonder why anyone would have their rib shortened ? ! i also wonder why humans may have lost yet magically regrew body hair within the past 240k years
22829,"yeah , that's pretty strange . the human body is very complex and confusing . did you know there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans ?"
22830,"i did know that . we are born with only two fears loud noise and falling . the rest is legitimately learned fears . kinda like people who are afraid to speak of politics . . . if a person is scared , there's a reason for such ! which side of the proverbial fence do you consider yourself to stand on ?"
22831,i think there's many fears one can be born with . i think fears are primitive ways of helping us avoid danger and survive .
22832,maybe . haha i can't really pinpoint what my biggest ' fear ' was before maybe the age of 3 . did you know only republican presidents wore beards ?
22833,i didn't know that . did you know harry truman refused to be photographed on dumbo as it would be associated with republicans ?
22834,"i did not know that . i do recall the symbols of the two parties being either a donkey or an elephant , not merely red or blue . i think those symbols are rather outdated and are due for a change ."
22835,that's true . there hasn't been a president since 1853 that was not republican or democrat .
22836,i've never understood why some people identify solely as one or the other . i cannot really claim allegiance to one or the other as there's not one person alive who i agree with every . single . thing . on .
22837,"yeah , i do believe life is not just black and white and you can't just stick to one side the entire time just for the sake of loyalty ."
22838,humans allegedly began exhibiting behavioral modernity 50k years ago . could it be we as a species are regressing ? ! losing that little knack as we did our hair ? !
22839,"that's interesting . did you know most plants and animals can synthesize their own vitamin c , but we can not because of a defective gene ."
22840,i knew that . i'm a huge lover of the ocean and all things nautical : scurvy didn't just climb onboard vessels lol . did you ever watch the show last week tonight with john oliver ?
22841,"no , i didn't . what was it about ?"
22842,evidently he was a comedian . he mentioned a tweet by the dropkick murphy's in 2016 . evidently thethen governor of wisconsin used a song of theirs on his campaign trail and they roasted him on twitter .
22843,"that's interesting , i think i would have the same reaction if someone used my song without permission . well , its been nice chatting ! bye !"
22844,are you in comedy movies ?
22845,i am ! do you have any favorites ?
22846,"i love watching bill murray movies , also i like bromantic comedies lol , how about you ?"
22847,i love the same as you . . . . i love the hangover and harold and kumar .
22848,"nice , my favorite bromantic comedy was pineapple express ! have you seen kung fu hustle ?"
22849,i haven't seen that one but i'm going to have to check it out since bill murray thinks that it's the supreme achievement of the modern comedy age .
22850,"that is interesting , i haven't seen it either but i know he made that comment . how about ryan stiles , do you know him ?"
22851,i'm not familiar with ryan stiles .
22852,he was in the drew carey show and whose line is it anyways . he dropped out of high school to pursue comedy and was very successful
22853,ahh . . . . ok . . . i remember him now . he was the tall skinny guy right ? did you ever watch 3rd rock from the sun ?
22854,"yea lol . i am currently watching that show right now , hilarious . have you seen it ?"
22855,i have ! it won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997 .
22856,"i heard that , i think they beat out seinfeld and other good shows . i can see why , john lithgow was great in it ! i recommend it"
22857,i agree ! do you like birds at all ? i love watching them .
22858,"i love birds , they are so interesting . their bones are so hollow !"
22859,yes ! they are so hollow that their entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers .
22860,how is that possible ! that is interesting for sure . did you know some birds fly from alaska to mexico without sleeping ?
22861,i did read that somewhere . that is pretty impressive !
22862,"right , i can't drive 2 hours without almost falling asleep ! it was so nice chatting with you !"
22863,did you know that the extinct dodo is actually a sub family of pigeon ? i had a good time !
22864,"i never knew that , i wonder how it became extinct . enjoy your day !"
22865,hi . are you a fan of newspaper comics ?
22866,i am ! i think they are funny ! how about you ?
22867,"used to follow peanuts . did you know several comic artists , like art spiegelman and looney tunes animator , chuck jones , have received prestigious art awards ?"
22868,"i didn't know that , do you know what awards they've won ?"
22869,"spiegelman and jones both won the macdowell medal . so did author toni morrison , the bluest eye , , painter georgia o'keeffe and playwright stephen sondheim , west side story , company , into the woods , ."
22870,that is so cool ! are you into comic books at all ?
22871,"marvel comics , of course , and some of the films developed from them . you"
22872,same here ! i didn't realize the cinematic universe takes place in earth199999 !
22873,"in marvel comics , yes . lots of time to develop all kinds of stories ! did you know the 1st comic books were just compilations of comic strips , like a book of peanuts strips would be ?"
22874,that is crazy how far they've come ! i mean there are so many volumes ! i'd like to see michigan states collection !
22875,heard it's the largest in the world . private collectors can be fanatic someone may have a larger collection out there .
22876,i'm sure there is ! some millionaire probably owns all the originals haha .
22877,just one original of charles shultz's sunday peanuts strip sells for 10's of thousands ! who knew ?
22878,that is very interesting ! do you like to read literature as well ?
22879,you bet . all kinds . do you have a favorite author ?
22880,you can't beat tolkien and the lord of the rings ! you ? i can't believe the fda burned six tons of literature in an act of us censorship !
22881,wonder when that burning took place ? agree tolkien books are great love the strange locations and the languages of the different clans . imaginative genius ? ?
22882,genius for sure ! probably around the time they were banning everything else like alcohol haha . i think it's cool that literature was an olympic event until 1952 !
22883,"that tells you about its greek origins . they were big on literature , poetry , painting , sculpture . not considered ' sports ' today . are you a fan of jazz ? ?"
22884,"i like it but not in love with it ! clint eastwood is a huge enthusiast i heard ! anyways , great chatting with you !"
22885,"catch winston marsales and his jazz ensemble if you ever have a chance . like louis armstrong on trumpet , maybe better ! ! nice chat . cheers ! !"
22886,i will look into that ! have a great day !
22887,hi do you like comic books ?
22888,"i sure do and you ? i love stan lee , he was the man"
22889,"he sure was , do you know how he ended his calls ?"
22890,considering he was stan it had to end with excelsior
22891,yeah exactly . do you know where marvel universe takes place ?
22892,yes it is earth199999 . do you know where the original comic book takes place ?
22893,yes that one takes place on earth616
22894,yeah . do you know how marvel trademarked the terms superhero and supervillain ?
22895,oh yeah they just published a generic comic book with those terms
22896,pretty genius of them . do you know what dc stands for ?
22897,yes that stands for detective comics so it is very redundant
22898,yeah strange . do you know where is the largest library of comic books ?
22899,yes that would be in michigan state university
22900,"yeah , i would like to visit i mean is the the largest in the world"
22901,yeah me too . do you read much besides comic books ?
22902,yes i read other stuff and know some facts about literature in general and you ?
22903,"me too . once the fda burned tons of books during censorship , so sad"
22904,yeah i know and literature used to be part of the olympic games
22905,"yeah too bad it was no more after 1912 along with sculpture , music , painting and others"
22906,yeah i know too bad . did you know churchill won the nobel prize for literature ?
22907,pretty cool guy . did you know romantic kissing can hardly be found in older books ?
22908,yeah it is a rather new thing in ancient greek they did not even mention it
22909,yeah pretty cool how times have changed
22910,hello
22911,hello did you know that art spiegelman was the first comic artist to recevie the macdowell medal ?
22912,"no , i sure didn't . what is that award ?"
22913,it's an award that goes to comic book writers
22914,oh ok . the first award went to thornton wilder in 1960
22915,i saw that . looks like it has been presented annually ever since . i'm surprised the largest comic book market in the world is japan .
22916,spiegelman has spent a halfcentury as an artist trying to help make sense of the shifting social and political landscape .
22917,50 years ! he must have started when he was young .
22918,yeah no doubt . he was part of the underground comix scene in the bay area in the early '70s .
22919,in 1980 i see he started the avantcomics magazine called raw .
22920,cool . spiegelman was also teaching courses in comics and aesthetics at the school of visual arts in new york .
22921,nice . i never heard of this guy before today . lol looks like he won a pulitzer prize in 1992 .
22922,comic book legend stan lee ends every phone conversation he has with the word ' excelsior ! '
22923,i didn't know that . did you know stan lee just died recently ? i think it was at the beginning of december
22924,"yes , i did hear that . the dc from dc comics stands for detective comics , so their company name is redundant ."
22925,looks like dc comics is the 2nd largest comic book publisher in the united states .
22926,"wow , that's cool . the michigan state university library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world"
22927,nice . the comic book market is huge . it was valued at 1 . 09 billion in the united states and canada in 2016 .
22928,"yeah , that's crazy ."
22929,i don't understand those manga comics . are you familiar with them ?
22930,"no , i'm not . thanks ."
22931,wow . by 1995 the manga market in japan was valued between 6 and 7 billion dollars ! . . . and thank you for the chat !
22932,that's awesome . thanks for the chat .
22933,we must be in the bonus round ?
22934,yeah really
22935,"hello , do you like comic books ?"
22936,i do ! do you ?
22937,yeah me too . do you know how stan lee ended his calls ?
22938,"no , how ?"
22939,with the word excelsior
22940,wow ! did you know he was in all the marvel movies as an extra ? i always tried to find him and giggle a little .
22941,cool i did not know that actually . do you know how marvel trademarked superhero and supervillain ?
22942,i did not . that's pretty cool . how do people get away with using it ? weird . . .
22943,well i guess you can use it but must give credit to marvel . they just published a generic comic book
22944,wow . michigan state has the largest comic book collection . who knew !
22945,yeah i would like to visit that at some point . do you know what dc stands for ?
22946,district of columbia ?
22947,"it is actually detective comics , it is a redundant name"
22948,that's pretty cool . did you know the the marvel cinematic unviverse take splace in earth 199999 ?
22949,did not know that . do you read other literature ?
22950,i read all sorts of stuff . what do you read ?
22951,i like novels a lot . too sad the fda once burned tons of books .
22952,yeah . what a waste . there is an annual literature contest that challenges people to come up with the worst opening line .
22953,i would like to read those . did you know literature was an olympic sport ?
22954,really ? why did they get rid of it . i would love that . have hemmingway walk in the olympic flag ? ? ? ?
22955,"i know , i guess they wanted to stick with sports only . nice chat : ,"
22956,hi are you a fan of ed sheeran ?
22957,i don't know who he is . i've heard the name but can't say that i would recognize any of his songs . wasn't one about a hobbit or something ?
22958,i'm not sure . lol i'm not too familiar with him . i'm reading up on him now . ed sheeran cites eminem as one of his biggest music influences .
22959,that's not helpful . i can't name an eminem song either . the only time i listen to music is when i take the grandson to school and other places . he likes teenager pop stuff but they rarely announce the artist name . so who knows what i'm listening to . is sheeran the guy who slept rough near buckingham palace for a couple years ?
22960,i couldn't honestly tell you . lol he has a better vocal range than freddie mercury . do you know much about the republican party ?
22961,"i know that lincoln was a republican and that they have changed from right to left and back , who knows how many times ? wasn't barry goldwater a famous republican ?"
22962,i believe he was . there hasn't been a us president who wasn't a republican or a democrat since 1853 .
22963,"those two parties do have a firm hold . nowadays we talk about red and blue states for the two parties . i can never keep it straight . i think red is a nicer , stronger color but politically i'm pretty blue ."
22964,nice . did you know that consistent use of red and blue colors only started in 2000 ? i could have swore i saw it a lot before then .
22965,i guess that i'm just a slow learner . i wonder how far back the elephant and donkey as mascots goes . i know in the '50s when truman went to disney land he made sure there was no dumbo in the background of any photos .
22966,"that's a funny story ! before trump , the last time a republican was elected president without a nixon or bush on the ticket was 1928 !"
22967,"but they take the record for only president to resign , nixon . in the 1930's the northeast and midwest were republican strongholds . now the northeast is a lot of democrats and the south has gone republican ."
22968,lol true ! every us president with a beard has been a republican . i never noticed that .
22969,"i guess those old guys like washington didn't like beards . i won't comment on our current guy's hair . i'm sure it's unique in some way . but who knows what's next in hair , supposedly we lost our body hair about 240 , 000 years ago . what's next ?"
22970,lol that's funny ! humans are adapted for persistence hunting making them among the best distance runners among all running animals .
22971,unlike the cheetah that can make a really fast burst of speed but then has to rest for a while . the other thing about our hunting is we use tools a lot more than other animals . and i think we are sneakier . especially our politicians .
22972,yes ! haha there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans .
22973,so why don't we just set up some giant speakers and make the other army run away . maybe get a punk band to play that sound .
22974,lol humans will regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 2 to 3 months of having it surgically shortened . odd fact of the day . it's been fun chatting !
22975,i don't buy that rib story . only crabs and such can regrow their claws . have a nice day .
22976,lol have a great day !
22977,hello ! how are you today ?
22978,"hello . i'm listening to nwa's straight outta compton , it reached platinum , without the support of airplay or a tour ."
22979,"i love that album ! they weren't the best selling album of the 21 century though , i'm trying to think of who it was ?"
22980,"i don't know , i know pink floyd's dark side of the moon was still going strong in 2014 ."
22981,that is crazy ! hasn't that been out for like 40 years now ? i think linkin park topped them though .
22982,maybe . i bought it on vinyl a few years ago .
22983,vinyls are making a comeback lol . i'm sure you can get bruno mars on vinyl now .
22984,"they never really went away , as they have always been issued . i would love a recording of the sounds of mars , they have a higher pitch than earth sounds ."
22985,that would be awesome to hear ! it would only take 23 days to get there at 1g speed !
22986,"evidently , lockheed martin lost a satellite , due to using the wrong measurement system ."
22987,i wonder what they were using haha . they better get it right by the year 2023 !
22988,what happens in 2023 ?
22989,"there is a mars colonization project happening then , and they are funding it with a reality tv show haha ."
22990,interesting . i wonder what the roman god of war has to say about that ? it is his planet .
22991,he would have wanted a better nickname to it than the red planet i'm sure lol .
22992,it is red though . from all of the iron oxide .
22993,i would call it the blood planet haha . i'm sure he would have liked that better ! can you believe bruno mars writes all of his own music ? that is rare these days !
22994,i don't know who that is . is he latin ?
22995,he's a pop artist . i think he is filipino but i could be wrong . he was named after a professional wrestler though haha .
22996,weird . i guess that's almost as bad as starting out as an elvis impersonator .
22997,"you have to start somewhere . maybe i should do that too ? haha it was nice chatting , have a great day !"
22998,hey do you listen to any albums ? i guess the vinyl album started in the 1972
22999,i like a lot of albums ! apparently walmart will only sell clean ones though !
23000,"ya that is very weird , would you buy the album from those identical japanese twins ? they were 100 years old when they made it haha"
23001,"i have never heard of that album , what is it like ?"
23002,"ya i haven't heard it , it's probably really weird and hard to find , it was made back in 1992"
23003,that is not too old ! led zeppelin once did not title an album to confuse the rock press
23004,"that is awesome , i love led zeppelin , did you ever listen to straight outt compton ?"
23005,"i did not , well maybe just the one song , why ?"
23006,well ya they got it to platinum status without any radio play apparently which is impressive
23007,"wow that is very impressive , maybe the street culture embraced it and spread the word ?"
23008,"haha it must be ! i do love pink floyd , and i like knowing that dark side of the moon is still a best selling album in 2014 !"
23009,"bob marley was on the charts for over 914 weeks , that is long time appeal !"
23010,"that is crazy ! that record is a classic , do you like the planet mars btw ? you know it was named for the god of war ?"
23011,"i know a bit about mars , i know that there is a dwarf planet between it and jupiter !"
23012,"wow that is cool , also cool is sounds on mars have a higher pitch than on earth , kind of crazy !"
23013,"is that true ? that is very interesting , i have heard that sunsets are blue there as well , odd place !"
23014,"ya that seems screwy , also screwy is there is a mars colonization project theyre making for 2023 , apparently it will be based on a reality tv show haha"
23015,really ? that news to me ! i heard some of the aluminum from the wtc was used to explore mars
23016,"oh wow that is interesting , what is crazy is that if you travelled at 1g acceleartion , it'd only take 3 days to get to mars"
23017,"how fast is 1g ? i know the curiosity rover sings itself happy birthday , which is cute !"
23018,"haha well it is probably fast actually , what is cool is that lichens from earth would actally be able to live on mars"
23019,"oh really ? that is great , i hope one day we can colonize to expand , that is a cool concept"
23020,"ya i agree , i want to visit mars ! kind of dumb nasa mixed up imperial and the metric system and that caused a lost satellite"
23021,bruno mars has recently been accused of cultural appropriation .
23022,i know and i am a bit confused as to why ?
23023,i guess he starting using various other types of music incorporated into his own .
23024,"they say because he isn't african american . . however , if thats the case then a lot of artist would fall into that category ."
23025,"i'm not sure how i feel about the whole thing . i didn't know he wasn't african american , to be honest ."
23026,"he's puerto rican and filipino . however , i think it's ridiculous . i've never thought that about him . ."
23027,"ultimately , it shouldn't matter , especially in the time and age that we currently live in"
23028,"i agree . shaun king had a valid question , should bruno not be allowed to sing ?"
23029,"he obviously should . i think a lot of the arguments are ridiculous , as well ."
23030,"he reaches all genres . . rock , funk , pop , raggae , rock , ect ."
23031,"yeah , he does have an eclectic musical palette , from a variety of cultures and backgrounds ."
23032,his real name is peter gene hernandez . . i saw him in concert this year .
23033,how was the concert ?
23034,it was amazing ! ! the band he performs with ' the hooligans ' played all kinds of instruments . . ella mae opened for him that night .
23035,i'm glad you had a great time ! i will have to listen to an album soon .
23036,it was his birthday as well . we all got birthday hats . . ed sheeran came out at the end
23037,how was ed sheeran ? i have heard good things .
23038,"well , i did not know that he was going to do a surprise performance and we left as soon as bruno exited the stage ! ! ! i could have kicked myself . . . cardi b was supposed to open for bruno but she just had her baby and canceled ."
23039,that is such a crazy experience . i need to go to a concert soon .
23040,i don't go to many but my husband surprised me with tickets .
23041,you have inspired me to go to more . great speaking with you .
23042,how's it going ? did you know mars is the second smallest planet in the solar system after mercury ?
23043,i did actually . did you know that mars is the fourth planet from the sun .
23044,"yea , mars is quite an interesting planet with the impact craters , valleys , deserts , and polar ice caps it has"
23045,it really is quite interesting .
23046,"it sure is , sounds on mars have higher pitch due to the differences in atmosphere"
23047,well opera singer would probably love to sing up there huh .
23048,"opera singers , lichens , and cyanobacteria , all 3 would thrive on mars"
23049,lol . they would all get to enjoy a blue sunset as well .
23050,"i wonder if there will be a way to reach mars using 1g acceleration , then people can visit in 3 days"
23051,im not sure but count me out . ill just stay here safely on planet earth .
23052,"well i'd definitely avoid it if locheed martin designs the ship , they caused a satellite to crash on mars from using the wrong measuring system"
23053,sounds like he needs a new line of work . did you know that there is a curiosity robot on mars .
23054,"yea , i've hear a little about it , and also the mars colonization project which will also be a reality show too"
23055,that sounds like something i could actually watch .
23056,"probably be better than watching bruno mars , even if he does write his own music"
23057,i agree im not his biggest fan . bruno was actually interviewed on mtv when he was 4 years old .
23058,"that's interesting , mars was also named after wrestler bruno sammartino"
23059,i didnt know that . apparently he has been an entertainer for a long time . he play elvis in a movie in 1992 .
23060,"he was also signed and dropped by motown records , he's had an interesting life"
23061,yes he has .
23062,"well i have to go , nice talking with you"
23063,did you watch the grammy 2018 awards ?
23064,yes . it was held in los angeles on feb 10 .
23065,"the 60th grammy awards , cant believe its been 60 years already , many history behind the awards"
23066,yeah . so many hard work and lot of creativity and dedication to their work .
23067,"a lot of dedication i agree with you there , what do you think of the winners ?"
23068,lot of creativity and thinking different from others and hard work .
23069,i think that bruno mars nailed it with his song ''thats what i like'' it won the award for best song
23070,in my blood is also good . you hear it or not ?
23071,"i thought it was good yeah and what about 24k magic ? nice song , great rythem ."
23072,"bruno mars record of the year . he is multiinstrumentalist , record producer , and dancer . he is know for his stage performance ."
23073,do you like him as an artist ? he is pretty young born in the year 1985
23074,his performances is amazing surely we want to accept his talent . ' hybrid theory ' is the best selling album of the 21st cenutry .
23075,it is ? that is a great album i wonde if one of mars albums is close in sales to that one
23076,an album is a collection of audio recordings issued as a collection on dvd . it was developed in 20th century .
23077,"wow , seems like albums have a lot of history ,"
23078,yeah . you know another mars . it is a fourth planet in the solar planet . it also called red planet because it is always hot .
23079,"must be a living hell , there is a project to colonize mars , its happening in the year 2023 , that will be an interesting show to watch ."
23080,nonclassical 24k magic bruno mars producer of the year . leonard bernstein best engineered album .
23081,"thats another great mars lol , i wonder how bruno mars will sounds in mars , the planet has higher pitchs than earth"
23082,amazing . very nice chatting with you . have a great day .
23083,"you too have a great day bye ,"
23084,"hi ! i do agree with tom perez that black women are in fact that backbone of the democratic party . if they do manage to pull off a blue wave , the democrats should thank black women for it ."
23085,"that's an interesting point of view . i try to avoid anything political , it's too depressing , lately ."
23086,what's crazy is there hasn't been a non republican or non democrat president since 1853 . they've all been either republicans or democrats !
23087,"i know , the consistent use of the red and blue colors for the republican and democratic parties only started in 2000 ."
23088,wow ! i wasn't aware of that . i just assumed those were always the party's colors . it's also crazy knowing there has never been a nonrepublican president with a beard .
23089,"in 1957 president harry truman visited disneyland and refused to be photographed on the dumbo ride so he wouldn't be associated with the republicans . and people talk about trump being childish , it's always went on . lol"
23090,agreed . crazy to think that happened in the 1950s especially when figures seemed more mature . it's the nature of the beast i suppose . politicians have to do whatever satisfies their base . like i couldnt believe regan campaigned for democrats and was once against high corporate profits !
23091,"yes , it's gotten so divided in the country , it's sad . reagan was good in that respect . he could honestly campaign for someone from a different party ."
23092,i know . it's sad to think people wouldn't dare do that these days . i was even surprised to learn democrats make up 15 percent of the party !
23093,"yeah , you don't hear too much about the tea party anymore , though ."
23094,true ! just like i had never heard the democratic party was the world's oldest active political party . i always assumed it was the republican party since it's referred to as the ' grand ole party ' ?
23095,i didn't know that either . did you know that the astronauts vote from space ?
23096,is that so ? that's very interesting as it saves them from having to worry about not being able to vote . i guess it's better to vote from space than in a lion infested jungle like the indian government does for a single voter . that is plain wrong !
23097,that is plain wrong . i read somewhere that 34 percent of the black male population in alabama have permanently lost the right to vote . how does that even happen ?
23098,that's a good question . especially when you consider black men gave 93 percent of their votes to doug jones in the deep red state of alabama .
23099,true . did you know that not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918 ?
23100,"really ? i wonder why that is ? can't help but wonder now that if not all men had the right to vote in austin , texas , would their garbage dump had been renamed fred durst ? ha !"
23101,that's too funny . i wonder how honored fred durst feels having the dump named after him ?
23102,ha ! i bet he isn't too happy about that . just like many aren't happy about republicans losing the popular vote in the last 6 out of 7 presidential elections .
23103,"yes , they are lots of those disgruntled about the republicans losing the popular vote but winning the election . read how your electoral system works , people . it was setup this way for a reason ."
23104,"that is so true ! i mean , the party was founded by antislavery activists so it doesn't bother me if they lose the popular vote , or any party for that matter . well it's been nice chatting with you ! take care !"
23105,did you see how democrats won the house in the last election ? apparently people think it's because black women were voting for them in large numbers
23106,i did see that . interesting stats . seems like that percentages are tipped to where people are voting for their own race .
23107,"yep that is what it seems like . for instance with black men , they made up 11 percent of the electorate but 93 percent of them voted for democrat doug jones"
23108,kind of crazy . did you know that hillary clinton was president of young republicans in college ? funny she ended up being a democrat .
23109,no i didn't know that . but what is interesting is that every president that has ever had a beard has been a republican
23110,that is interesting ! never put 2 and 2 together . the us congress has played a republicans vs democrats baseball game annually since 1909 with the republicans hold a slight edge with 3 more wins that the democrats .
23111,"well that's interesting . what do you think about the fact that republicans and democrats have always been a president since 1853 , before that they were called other names"
23112,i didn't know that . how interesting . since ww2 the us economy consistently performs better under democratic presidents . interesting stat .
23113,"yeah that is interesting . it's also interesting that the colors red and blue have only been associated with republicans and democrats since about the year 2000 , i always thought it was much longer than that"
23114,wow . you're right . . . i thought it was much longer too . another funny switcheroo . . . . ronald reagan was originally a democrat by switched over to be a republican .
23115,"yeah that is interesting , originally he would campaign for democrats and he would campaign against corporate profits and low wages , very shocking"
23116,interesting . supposedly republicans are statistically more educated than democrats .
23117,well you have a lot of great facts don't you haha . what do you think about voting though ? did you know that astronauts can vote from space
23118,"i didn't know that . lol i do see where a chimpanzee received 400 , 000 votes in a mayoral election in rio de janeiro . lol"
23119,"wow that's funny lol i wonder if he did a good job being the mayor lol . did you know that in india they set up a polling booth for only one person , it was in a forest full of lions lol"
23120,"lol what were they thinking ? lol if all of canada was one state in the us , it would only have 50 electoral votes which is fewer than california ."
23121,"wow that's crazy ! what scares me though is that only in 1918 did all men in the united kingdom finally have the right to vote , i wonder what was holding it up"
23122,that is weird . maybe because they were still ruled by a king and queen ?
23123,"i'm not 100 percent sure about that , what i do know is that in alabama , 34 percent of the black male population can't even vote"
23124,wow . why is that ?
23125,"i think they lose the ability to vote once they go into prison , and so that is why they can't vote anymore"
23126,"hi , how are you ? are you interested in politics ?"
23127,"i am interested in it , but i know you have to tread carefully around it ."
23128,"yes , many people have strong opinions on the matter , but in these chats , we can safely exchange opinions . the two parties are not enough for this country . agree ?"
23129,that i can agree on . difficult to see it changing . the democrats and republicans have the system sown up .
23130,"yes , the money flows to them and those outside the system cannot get in without money . too bad ."
23131,"i know there have bee third party , or independent candidates , nader , perot , but they just act as spoilers and never have a real chance ."
23132,i dont know what else they could do except maybe run for a different office like senator or governor . i think people want someone that can change things rapidly but that is not possible .
23133,"how about some voting facts ? a chimp received 400 , 000 votes in brazil once ."
23134,the chimp probably did have some good social policies . better than his opponents . plus people like chimps . especially when they wear tuxedos .
23135,"maybe all votes should be based on novelty clothes . there's always these animals gaining political office , i heard of a dog that passes away last week that was a three time mayor of some town somewhere in america"
23136,"the dog was a good boy , one of the best , and was always ready to play fetch . house trained . perfect for the office ."
23137,house trained should be the very basic requirement . that would be an interesting question at the presidential debates .
23138,i think most of trump's family would do fine . dont know about trump though . the 2020 election ought to be interesting .
23139,"in terms of civility , yes . i can't see it being a 99 . 85 percent vote to either candidate , like in the norwegian referendum ."
23140,we could make a law that would mandate voting . that would be interesting .
23141,when 40 percent of a state votes against the interracial marriage that might not be the best idea .
23142,"yes , but then people would get the govt that they deserve . they cannot complain that they did not participate ."
23143,i know in australia you get fined if you don't vote .
23144,"yeah , ive heard that . the idea is that its your govt , you need to choose . i like it . anyway , great chat"
23145,"same here , and we didn't yell at each other about each other stupid beliefs ."
23146,"yes , i get tired of the yelling . im sure you and i disagree on many thing , but yelling has never changed another persons mind ."
23147,have a good evening . farewell .
23148,"hi , do you know who bruno mars is ?"
23149,i do . he is my favorite music artist . who is your favorite singer ?
23150,"i am a bit older , so i am not up on current singers . one of my old favorites was janis joplin . what kind of songs does mars sing ."
23151,i believe he mostly sings hip hop and funk . did you know that bruno mars writes his own music ?
23152,no i didn't . i have tried to imagine how someone can put together a piece of music . i guess you either have that talent or you don't .
23153,"yep , bruno mars was actually named after the professional wrestler bruno sammartino"
23154,that is interesting . were his parents just big sammartino fans or what ?
23155,"not sure , but bruno mars was originally an elvis impersonator . talk about ironic ."
23156,wow ! that is a big surprise . so from what i understand his songs are nothing like elvis ?
23157,"i agree , they are pretty different from elvis's . bruno mars's music is pretty original , and it is paired up with his excellent dancing skills"
23158,i'll have to listen to some of his music . i'm always open to new music . which of his songs would you suggest for an old rocker like me ?
23159,"i am not sure since i am not the biggest music fan out there . however , i believe queen has had some huge hits like bohemian rhapsody ."
23160,now queen i am familiar with . but speaking of mars did you know that sounds on mars have a higher pitch than on earth ?
23161,"is it because of the atmosphere on mars ? maybe after we colonize mars , we can experiment with the difference of the pitches ."
23162,yes . i hope i live to see us land on mars . i understand a colonization project is planned for 2023 .
23163,it was spacex's ambitious plan right ? i really hope that we can colonize mars before the end of the 21st century . i would like to visit mars one day .
23164,yes i think so . that would be great wouldn't it . some people think we are from mars but had to leave because they lost their atmosphere .
23165,"yep , and since there are polar icecaps on mars , we could have come from mars as there used to be life on mars ."
23166,they say it could currently still be supporting life such as lichens and cyanobacteria . we would just need to restore the atmosphere and there we are .
23167,it would only take us 23 days to fly to mars under 1g of acceleration . that is a very fast speed !
23168,that is fast if they can do it . the length of time for the trip has been a major drawback .
23169,"currently it will take a few months to get to mars . if we do manage to colonize mars , getting aid to mars will prove to be a difficult challenge when mars is faced with an emergency"
23170,i would think that we would send several unmanned supply trips before the colonization starts so there would be an ample amount of supplies already there .
23171,"i agree , and maybe even some robots that could help organize those supplies , although i do not think robot technology is able to do that right now ."
23172,robots would be good . i don't think we are far away from that technology right now . look at what they're doing with self driving cars .
23173,"google's self driving cars have proven themselves on the field , although i still think that it will take time for the government to allow people to own these cars ."
23174,i agree . i have been driving so long i probably wouldn't want one . but i could see them doing long range over the road trucking .
23175,"that would cut the cost of transport by a lot , but i am sure that there will be much job loss attributed to the success of self driving cars ."
23176,"that is a definite downside . it's really been great chatting with you , but i'm afraid i have to say good night ."
23177,"hello , were you aware that fox news thought of creating a channel that would only air the simpsons ? how cool would that be ?"
23178,haha yes i would watch that ! kind of crazy they get more views than cnn and msnbc combined
23179,"i would as well . what's hilarious , is that it threatened to sue the simpsons , to stop them from doing parodies of their antidem agenda . that's unreal ."
23180,"ya that sounds really dumb , also weird that richard nixon was a founder of fox news"
23181,"that is surprising , i didn't know that he and richard ailes were friends ."
23182,"ya i didn't know that either , its interesting its in 86 countries , so a lot more than just the usa"
23183,"if i'm not mistaken , the international markets have fox extra segments during commercial breaks . i guess they are everywhere ."
23184,"ya it would seem so , do you ever do fantasy football ?"
23185,i do not . i'm more into poetry and classical music . did you know shakespeare invented the name miranda ?
23186,"i didn't thats impressive , crazy that he and pocahontas were alive at the same time period"
23187,"what's crazier , is that everything we know about him privately , has been recorded by others ."
23188,"ya he i still a mystery , and yes he also invented the names olivia and jessica"
23189,"it really makes you wonder . the same with tchaikowsky , he donated his skull to the shakespeare company . to be used as a prop . people were so strange back then ."
23190,"ya that is screwy , also screwy is that in his time people had a different accent and way to pronounce things , so things that don't rhyme now would have rhymed back in his day"
23191,that's why modern translations often don't make any sense . kinda like how people do the fantasy draft of the national spelling bee .
23192,"haha , ya they even have fantasy politics , like these people will bet on anything haha"
23193,"at this point , i bet the fantasy politics is better than real , lol . then again , i guess it's the allure of the wealth . like that one guy who won the lottery and bought a waterpark ."
23194,"haha that sounds awesome ! have you ever read anything by terry pratchett ? i guess he was knighted , so his books must be good"
23195,"no , i haven't even heard of him . is his work anything like that janitor in chicago , who wrote a 15 , 000 page fantasy manuscript ?"
23196,"i don't know , but that janitor also did over 300 watercolor paintings in the book , it sounds kind of awesome actually"
23197,"it truly does . i'm always in awe of people who can do things like that . thank you for chatting with me , have a wonderful evening ."
23198,"you too , and be careful with fantasy stuff , only a single brain fold is the difference between realizing something is fantasy or reality !"
23199,do you think lotto winners should be obligated to make their name public ?
23200,no . it invites criminals and other slime . should should be able to remain anonymous . i really think it's a safety issue . i don't buy the argument of the lottery people .
23201,"do you think people would believe that there was actually a winner , if it were not disclosed who it was ?"
23202,i don't know but it's not worth getting someone killed . the lottery company could prove to some independent agent that's sworn to secrecy .
23203,that is a good idea . the law might not be on her side according to open records laws . you can form an anonymous trust but needs to be be done before signing her name .
23204,"yeah , it's a mess . i guess i would argue the case of personal safety because there are some horror stories of lottery winners being the victims of crime ."
23205,"yeah , and lottery winners often get swindled ."
23206,yep . so are you into fantasy stuff . i really did like ' the lord of the rings ' . it's the only fantasy film to win the academy award for best picture .
23207,not that much . i do like a good fantasy film i can really get into though . a single fold in the brain makes the difference between knowing reality from fantasy .
23208,some people in politics seem to be missing that feature . wow there is a university where one can actually study scfi and fantasy . . . wonder what school has that ? in la no doubt . . .
23209,some people take fantasy seriously . comedic fantasy author terry pratchett was knighted for his services to literature .
23210,i think there is a case for tolkien in that regard . he foresaw hitler and ww ii though fantasy . henson used it to teach children to some degree . . .
23211,interesting . did william shakespeare write any fantasy ?
23212,i would say he had characters that were fantastic but not really a fantasy writer . funny that he intentionally made grammatical errors to get the audience's attention .
23213,"and a lot of phrases he coined are still in use today like laughing stock , wild good chase and good riddance ."
23214,"i think he proved that human nature is a very unchanging thing . wow , there are 33 shakespeare gardens that only grow stuff that he mentioned . stay clear of the hemlock !"
23215,"i would love to visit . there are also several popular names that were invented by him like jessica , olivia and miranda ."
23216,cool . i recently read that msnbc is 85 percent dedicated to opinion . i'm skeptical . . . that only allows for 15 percent being dedicated to news .
23217,interesting . apparently fox news is watched more than cnn and msnbc combined .
23218,that i actually knew . that's why i don't believe that the median view age is 68 for fox news . that doesn't even make sense unless there are a lot of 100 plus yearolds out there .
23219,they discussed the possibility of making a cable cahnnel that would only air the simpsons . would you watch ?
23220,i like the simpsons so yes . . . i stream on my laptop more than i watch tv .
23221,"speaking of which , i'm in the mood to watch the simpsons . have a good night !"
23222,"hi , do you like fantasy ?"
23223,not really . i prefer comedy . how about you ?
23224,yeah somewhat . did you know people fantasy draft the spelling bee
23225,i didn't know that . do you like the lord of the rings ? the return of the king is the first and only fantasy film to ever get an academy award for best picture .
23226,i actually like it a lot . do you know what keeps the reality from fantasy separate in us ?
23227,i'm not sure . what is it ? jim henson made ' the black crystal ' because he felt that children should never be afraid . he wanted them to return to fantasy's darker roots like hans christian andersen tales .
23228,wow did not know that . do you like any news channels ?
23229,i prefer not to watch the news . i find it depressing . how about you ?
23230,yeah me too but i heard fox news is the most watched
23231,i hear the median viewer age is 68 though
23232,do you know who created it ?
23233,who created it ?
23234,richard nixon and richard ailes
23235,interesting . i did not know that . fox news threatened to sue the simpsons because they didn't like them parodying their anti democratic party agenda .
23236,yeah and at the same time they want to create a chanell to play only simpsons
23237,"ha , interesting . would you watch tv all day if you won the lottery ? travel ? do something else ?"
23238,definitely travel and maybe try and catch some shakespeare dramas
23239,is there a such thing as too much money though ? there was a lottery winner who wanted to remain anonymous . there have been reports of lottery winners getting killed after they disclose their names .
23240,wow did not know that . did you know shakespeare made up a bunch of women's names
23241,i did not know that . he also made grammatical errors on purpose to emphasize points in his plays .
23242,that is remarkable . nice chat
23243,hi ! do you play any sports ?
23244,"not really so much anymore , but i used to . how about you ?"
23245,i used to play volleyball but with only three players instead of six like what is typically played and we always tried to slam the ball .
23246,that's pretty interesting . did you know that volleyball and basketball were both invented at the ymca ?
23247,"i didn't know that ! i wonder if they patented or licensed those inventions ! i knew that our local ymca basketball height was the same regardless of gender , but wasn't the same for volleyball nets , the women's nets were much shorter . do you think that's fair or reasonable ?"
23248,that's not too fair . they say that the best female volleyball player in the world is nicknamed ' game over . '
23249,"lol , that's a great nickname ! that would definitely strike a sense of intimidation and fear in me if i new that the opposing team had a player like that . maybe she got her nickname by kicking the volleyball , it's actually not against the rules to do that !"
23250,"that's pretty interesting , so i guess you can use any part of your body in volleyball ?"
23251,"yeah , none of it is against the rules , that would've been useful to know since my wrists were in so much pain from hitting the ball ."
23252,i bet . did you hear that fedex actually returned a volleyball that washed up after the japanese tsunami ?
23253,how did they know who to return it to ? i'm glad no sharks got ahold of that treasured volleyball . sharks were existent even before dinosaurs and trees !
23254,i was wondering that myself . sharks are amazing ! they can be trained like dogs to bark !
23255,"they can bark ? i think i'd be too afraid to wait and listen to their sounds the moment i see their mouth open and sharp teeth even though they can rescue sailors , like dolphins . i think i'd much prefer to hitch a ride with dolphins than sharks , you ?"
23256,"yeah , i'd feel safer with the dolphins than the sharks . apparently great white sharks congregate in the middle of the pacific ocean in an area known as the white shark cafe . i don't think i'd want to go there , i have a feeling that i'd be the entree ."
23257,"lol , as friendly as it sounds to enter that cafe , i wouldn't want to enter either even though they have no rib cages , their massive size can cause them to literally crush their own bodies , i wonder if any other animals have no rib cages like sharks ."
23258,"that's pretty interesting , i wonder if wikileaks leaked that information . wikileaks actually published the government's plans to destroy wikileaks ."
23259,was it in those documents that revealed that 86 percent of the land in nevada is owned by the us government ?
23260,i'm not sure about that . i wonder if most of the land there consist of military bases and test sites ? i mean area 51 is there i believe .
23261,"yes , i think that's what its used for mainly , but maybe its in those wikileaks that reveal the actual purpose of housing bases there and perhaps even information regarding whether anyone has attempted to sell the statue of liberty like a man in france who managed to sell the eiffel tower twice ! i wonder who the prospective buyers were ."
23262,"that is pretty crazy , what would be even crazier is if it was the same buyer both times ."
23263,"yeah , but hopefully those documents reveal how much the us government has done , maybe something like the norwegian government where they donated one billion to help save the amazon rainforest !"
23264,are you familiar with computers ?
23265,yeah . use them all the time . wish i could use one in the pool .
23266,"that's too bad , they're not waterproof . but they can easily carry out tasks called programs ."
23267,well i was thinking of that because the russians made a computer that runs on water .
23268,"oh really , i think i heard something something about it now i think about it , what year was it ?"
23269,"1936 . you can't even smoke in font of an apple , so what the russians did is pretty impressive ."
23270,"well , technically you can smoke in front of an apple , you just void the warranty , which i guess is a bad thing as well ."
23271,"ahh , i see . well , better not to smoke ."
23272,"ya , scientists have done many research on it"
23273,i hear bones become magnetic when exposed to radiation . so scientists measured them in order to determine how much radiation people absorbed in hiroshima
23274,"really ? akihito , the emperor of japan is a scientist and he still publishes papers ."
23275,"that is impressive . not as impressive as walking on the moon , like harrison schmitt did , but impressive nonetheless"
23276,harvard scientists have also managed to store a gif of a galloping horse in some dna .
23277,ha ha . too much time on their hands ? that should definitely be in sacremento's library of things
23278,"it must be a pretty big achievement to have done that , i don't think they would give it to the library of things ."
23279,what if it were a library founded by william gladstone ?
23280,"well , william gladstone's library only had books , although there were about 32 , 000 books , which is still impresive ."
23281,"yeah , you'd need a big ass wheelbarrow to get them all there"
23282,"it was 3 or 4 of a mile , must be a hard task for a man aged 85 ."
23283,"yeah . he should've just asked norway to do it , since they are always distributing books to library"
23284,"that sounds like a great idea ! anyways , it was nice talking to you ."
23285,hey there do you like going to the library ?
23286,i enjoy a good library . just got a great book about hiroshima and the atomic bomb .
23287,"ah nice , ya i go all the time , i wish my library were like the one in the uk though where you can get things like sewing machines , that would be useful"
23288,i've heard about those . library of things they call them . there is one in sacramento
23289,"oh nice , maybe i should move there haha , nice to know that over half of adults have library cards though"
23290,reading is fundamental . did you ever hear about the man who was falsely convicted that used his prison time to study law at the library ?
23291,"lol , i did , and then he became a lawyer to help free other people , thats so nice !"
23292,i wonder if it is worth it to publish in norway . you are guaranteed 1000 copies will be bought and distributed to libraries !
23293,"haha yes , and 1500 if its a kids book , you're guaranteed to make money !"
23294,true . i would like to find instructions on building a waterrun computer like the russians built in 1936 .
23295,"ya i am so curious how that works , also how someone could upload their mind to a usb drive"
23296,that is not so far out when you consider the space shuttle computer runs on 1mb of ram .
23297,"ya that is impressive , do you have an android or an iphone btw ?"
23298,"i use an iphone , even though one cannot smoke near one since that is a biohazard !"
23299,"right , i dont smoke but thats kind of crazy , did you know the emperor of japan is a scientiest ?"
23300,i have heard that . scientists like john von neumann are amazing people .
23301,ya and akihito the emperor still publishes papers even today
23302,it is amazing the term scientist has only been around since 1833 .
23303,"ya thats not long , and for the record i love the scientist who invented the internet in 1989 , what a genius !"
23304,true . now they can even store binary software in bacterial dna !
23305,that is crazy ! and ya i wonder how they did that gif of a galloping horse
23306,thanks . i think im going to go try some minecraft !
23307,you should ! and you should try making a 16 bit computer with the blocks !
23308,hi . do you like going to the library ? i think it's cool how many things are available to borrow .
23309,i love going to the library but now a days i pretty much search and check my books out online . it is amazing at what all is available at the library .
23310,yes so much more convenient . you are right from newspapers to manuscripts to films even cd's !
23311,i know and video games . did you know they try to lure the teenagers into the library with this ?
23312,quite funny i bet it works ! if you publisha book in norway the government will buy 1000 copies and distribute them to libraries . i wonder if they do the same with children's books ?
23313,hmmm . not sure . all ships visiting the ancient city of alexandria had to surrender their books for immediate copying . then they put the originals in the library of alexandria .
23314,oh wow . interesting . one cool fact is that there are more libraries that mcdonalds which makes me have hope for us !
23315,thank goodness ! ! did you know that a jawbone revealed how much radiation a hiroshima bomb victim absorbed . i am sure the results were frightening .
23316,that is fascinating but scary at the same time . i bet a scientist came up with that idea . hard to believe it wasn't until the 19th century that the term scientist came into use .
23317,i am surprised at that ! i am also surprised that it is illegal to own a rabbit in queensland without having a magicians license or being a scientist . what do they have against pet rabbits ?
23318,haha hilarious . there are too many wild rabbits there . only one scientist has ever walked on the moon . . . harrison schmitt .
23319,that is neat . i am amazed at scientists . did you know that harvard scientists managed to store a gif animation of a galloping horse in the dna of bacteria . how did they really know it was there ? sounds sketchy or
23320,sounds very sketchy ! the emperor of japan was a scientist and he still published papers !
23321,hmmm . did you know that the first computer algorithm was written by a woman named ada lovelace ?
23322,sounds like a harry potter character lol ! i am thankful to the english scientist who invented the world wide web in 1989 !
23323,so is al gore ! lol .
23324,haha hilarious . that english scientist who discovered the web did it with a statefunded organization . they should be proud .
23325,absolutely ! the first google computer at stanford was housed in lego bricks . not sure what that says !
23326,haha i would love to see that in action . also never smoke near apple computers as it voids the warranty !
23327,i had no idea . thank goodness i don't smoke . i am sure that i would be the one to void it if possible .
23328,haha maybe so . the russians even made a ocmputer that ran on water once . well on that note i will say goodbye . it was lovely talking with you .
23329,"hello , what's of interest to you ?"
23330,i think libraries are a fascinating entity . an entire building of resources that can be borrowed for free !
23331,me too although the internet has kept me out of them for years .
23332,yeah that's true most of the information can be accessed online now . but one library in sacramento has things like sewing machines you can borrow
23333,"wow , that's cool . i've only been to sac once . it would cool if they did that with power tools ."
23334,hopefully more libraries will do that . whoa yeah power tools would be sweet and a great idea . they can be very expensive to buy .
23335,"yes , i don't use them enough to justify the expense ."
23336,"yeah and i didn't realize how many libraries there were in the us , more libraries than mcdonalds , and over half the population have library cards ."
23337,libraries are cool . i used to frequent them . it is one of the best things one can do for free .
23338,yeah i don't use them enough either . now computers can basically do everything and it's basically like having a library at home .
23339,"the internet and computers have taken on the role , perhaps too much . there is something satisfying about turning pages ."
23340,"yeah i agree . in addition , the technology continues to improve every day . transhumanists for example want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks !"
23341,"yeah , i heard that . as long as they stick to smart people like the english scientist that invented the www ."
23342,"yeah good point , i can't imagine how smart that guy must be !"
23343,smarter than me ! we also don't really need weapon makers like the people that built the bomb that erased hiroshima .
23344,yes that's true . atleast some good has come of it with the brazilian physicist mascarenhas making all those advances with measuring radiation levels .
23345,i worked in the nuclear industry and radiation is scary . a dirty explosive would be enough to paralyze a city .
23346,wow i can't imagine that ! have you ever been tested for radiation ?
23347,"we wore a tld badge that was tested regularly , time lapsed doesmeter , . kind of like they did to test people in 1945 ."
23348,oh that's good . yeah the current technologyelectron spin resonance sounds pretty cool .
23349,yes . technology booms . nice talking to you .
23350,you too thanks
23351,over and out . . .
23352,do you like to play volleyball ? i do but only really play a few times in the summer .
23353,hi i love volley ! ! i was in the team in high school
23354,nice ! so was i . miss those days . volleyball has been a part of the summer olympic games since 1964 .
23355,cool did you know kicking is legal in volley ?
23356,i actually did know that . lol
23357,"me too , what i did not know is that the women's net was 7 inches shorter in volley"
23358,knew it . lol i didn't know however that the best female player in the world is called game over . funny .
23359,"oh my , what a name ! ! lol . . i like when the team actually make the three touches before passing it to the other team"
23360,nice . lol fedex returned a volleyball that washed up after the japanese tsunami . lol
23361,"wow what a story , cool . wonder where it was found . . and it's also crazy it was not eaten by any sharks !"
23362,right ? both volleyball and basketball were invented at the ymca ! let's talk about sharks !
23363,"i learned that , if trained , sharks can bark and that rhymes"
23364,isn't that something ? have you ever heard of the white shark cafe ?
23365,no . tell me about it
23366,it's in the middle of the pacific ocean in an area where great white sharks congregate .
23367,"i like to visit that , from a distance ! ! ! did you know sharks rescue sailors"
23368,i didn't know that and i wouldn't like to be the one to see if they could . lol
23369,"i am both terrified and amazed of them , maybe i will go to the shark cafe one day ! !"
23370,lol sharks evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees . maybe that's why they know how to bark and rescue sailors ? lol it's been fun chatting !
23371,well i love to talk about animals ! !
23372,me too . have a great day !
