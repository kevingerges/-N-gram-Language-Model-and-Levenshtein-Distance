26,ah see . most oft he stadiums can be changed to indoors . . right ? i feel .iek people watch the game for the qb . .
27,i'n not sure how many are outdoors only . i lke to watch mabnagersa nd coaches lkke gruden . fun to see tjeir reactions .
28,the pissed off readtions ?
29,sometimes . sokmetimes it's a happy reaction . ljikew hen brad johnson thrrw a td pwss to himself in a superbowl !
30,"i don't realpy know how nfl came to be though . there's so many different variations of football that exist . . . rugby , gridirojn , soccer . . . just so many"
31,i think there wer ecollege people that still wanted to play . 14 of the 25 larges stadiumz are u . s . colelge stadiums .
32,with all the preventuon ont he high school level against concussions . . . jisn't that the end f the game already if the parents don't want their kids to go into football ?
33,i played in hsa nd my parents made the call . jyg mom didn'5 like tge idea . i dind't have my dad do the f9ght song like snoop eogg's son .

37,"yeah , in my dreqms . did you know tat only two africanamerican qbs have won the superbowl . too bad warren moon didn't ."
38,there also seems to be more records being broken every year . . . especially whe nthe patriots have bren at the superbowl so many times . . .
39,yeah . iw onder in homer simpson has a record for having 188 jobs in 400 episodes ?
40,lol . gotta love the simpsons . been o the air for so long .
41,"yeah . i still get a kick out of homer . i'm not much for things li,e ' the shark tank . ' i hear the deasl they make are phony ."
42,well a lot of peopp4 go 9n shark tank just to get the name out . i think that does wonde rthan wctually gt a deal with any of the members on shark tank .
43,"that's yrue . thanks , you were an excellent chat patner !"
44,he there do you have a favorite quarterbac k? i personally don't watch the nfl that much bu8t i do like tom brady
45,i don't hav ea favorite qb . i guess brady just won the sb again . how many t5imes is that ?
46,i think it's 6 at this point isn't it ? another quarterback i like is kelle nmoore . he's the only lefthande dquarterbzck in th eleague
47,whyt he small number of lefties ? xoes 8t have something to do ith setting up the offesne differently for a lefty ?
48,"it migth be ? i wonder if it ives him an advantage or a disadvantage beinf lefthadned ? what quarterbacks are geniuses though likea lex smith oh , have you heard of him"
49,alex smith ? waht team does he paly for ? why is he a genius ;
50,"well het ook a lot of ap tests when he was in high school nad so he got into his university as a jnior . then he got his achelor's degree in only 2 years and was al,most through hiws madter's degree before becoming the first choice in the 200 5draft"
51,"impressive . got through colleg 3that fast , then studied at the graduate level while playing ball ? bright guy ."
52,yes i think so . anohter iteresting guy is baker mayfield . he's a quarterback and th9ought about becoming a professsional gamer before finally getting drafted into the nfl
53,i wonde rhow many girls he would get as a gamer . seems like the ppularity factor is better swith the nfl .
54,"oh he made the right choice haha . another guy who made the right coice is paul d hubgard , he was a deaf quarterback and cteated the circular huddle that football players use today"
55,j guess i thought the huddle was something that was there from the beginning . a deat qb ? i wonder how well he dud .
56,"that'sw hat i was wondering too . i guess maybe he could still yel lout calls and different thyings like audibles , but you'd think that you would have to be hearin gin order tob e a quality quargterback . but he did invent the huddle so he's done more for football than em haha"
57,true . what do you think of u of iowas' locke rroom painting tactic ?
58,"i don't know , i'd b curious if that would help or hurt the m .if i went into a locker room and ig was paited tank it would make me mad and i would play begte ri think haha . ahat do you think ?"
59,"i would get mad too . if that tactic worked , then other teams would copy it ."
60,yep i think so . although i wonder if that's what hwppened for the hignest scoring football game of all time . it was 222 to 0m aybe the winning team had the other team's locker roo mpainted pink lol
61,that's true . or maybe somebody goofed when they made the schedulw . why would gt do that to a team ? seems wrong .
62,i know rigut ! it's a hundred to zero i th8nk the game is officially over haha . do yku lik3e the patriots at all ? i know they have a player that's never fumble the blal which i think is awesome
63,i hope he got a bonus for that feat . that's amazing . he must have spevial gloves or something . whats his name ?
64,"his name is benjarvis green3llis , and ye syou must have a secret as to how he was able to pull that off haha alhtpough i would be very concerned every time i played because every game you play is a chabce tor uib that record haha"
65,hello how are you doing ?
66,"hello , i am doking great , you ? dl you like footblal ?"
67,i love it . did you know that top bowlers uswd to make more than football stars did ?
68,"i love it also9 ! that is interesting , i wodner how much more foogball players make now than bowlers"
69,i would say it is a whole lot these days .
70,i ahree lol . did you know the firs5t nfl playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80 yard cield in chicago
71,thatsa mazing . look what it has grown into . billions of dollars in it . millions and milliona of fans . its great .
72,right ! now they even have chip technology in players should pads tracking data for them
73,that really is amazing technology . did you know that benjarvis yrseen lelis has never fumbled in his areer l
74,"i heard that before , that is a great fea ! he needs to te4ach a lcinic to thesen ew era rbs on how to hold on to the ball !"
75,"well tfhere had to be a touch of luck invo,ved . he played for a long timke ."
76,for sur e! i liked his name lol . do you know thed lions coach matt patricia ?
77,yeah didnt he use t6o coach in new england
78,"yea the assistant , now coaches the lions . the guy is z rlocket scientist !"
79,really . i wonder if that helps him with football at all . other tha nhaving a really good mind .
80,i weas thinkinh the same3 thin g. do hou watchc ollege football at all ?
81,njot dreally . i did hear that teh universituy of iowas visiting locekr room is painted pink . i thought tha twas prett6 funny .
82,"that is true , i live down the street from that stadium . it is because pink has a natural calming effect on people wh see i8t !"
83,yeah ims ure thats why . lol .
84,"for sure , maybe why they are good at home for football . it was very nice chatting with you !"
85,nice chaqtting with you to . have a great day .
86,"hey how are you , you think cte is real ?"
87,"i think it sreal , players end up with bra9n damage and that is a sad thing"
88,"for sure , i wonder how much of it i sin the player before they start too ? got to have something going on there to want to play in the nfl but yah , too manyt concussions is way too much and too many people getting hurt ."
89,"eah traumatic grain injuries that are also difficult tod iagnose , the symptoims take a long time to disappear ."
90,"they do , usually caused by repeated blows to the head , very difficult to diagnose indee . it's something but no one wants to ;au aqttention to it it seens ."
91,did you watch that movie the one with will smith ? i thought it was revealing and the game should evolve and change for the better
92,"what was that movie called again ? i did see it , was it called condusson right ?"
93,"yeah i thinhk thats it , self explained name whren you thnk abou tit and also ''chronic traumatjc ehncephalopathy ' sounds like a serious condition ."
94,"tnhat lien ' tell the truth ' is pretty iconic in my opinion , i twas a good movie for sure . made me view tge nfl ab it diferent . i guess it makes us thin kif millions of dollars for a few years os worth all that ?"
95,"i don't think it is , i do love the game but htink it should be safer for players . have you ever heard of gaelic football ?"
96,"i have no t, what is gaelic football ? is it like rugby ?"
97,its another fariation of footballh av3en'g watched it but i guess its also really interestig .
98,very imteresting . i wonder if ir has more than 11 minute so flive footbal llike the nfl has on average per game .
99,"that is not a lot of time ,t he superbowl was really long lasted more than 3 hours"
100,"oh wow , that was such a borfing super bowl though , tom brady is so good , and i'm not evwn af an of his lol ."
101,"yeah , he is one of teh best qb ever to play the gake . engineers end up earning more money than football players"
102,"i cou8ld see that , i'm surw nfl players have a lot more fun in their 20s , maybe not so m7ch their 40s and 50s thoygh whn they are aso sore haha ."
103,"i have no idea about that lol , what ar eyour thoughts on the tackgn hcips the players have embedded in their shoulders ."
104,"i think it's pretty cooll , the chips help them with their analytics , that's why you s4ee so many 3's in the bgnan ow , they've studied al lthe data and for some people it's b4neficial to lob 3s instead of jumpers ."
105,oh so you are basketbal fan as well and yea hit is pretty cool all the interesting stats we can learn thanks to those chips .
106,"for sure , data i sreally changing the world . great talking witrh you though , i hope you have a grea night 2 take care !"
107,do you like sports ?
108,"i do , did you watch the superbowl last month ?"
109,i was okay
110,"ui liked it , my favorite team wws playing although it was a slow superbow; ."
111,which team ? how was their performance
112,"the patriots andt heir perfomance was good considerng they won , what do you think of brain damage and the game"
113,i like the patriots too . much like hte lannistes of football
114,"theyh ave dominated the nfl for a while so yeah , thats a valid anlaogy ,"
115,"ya snd they have amazing players like brady . surprised he is still playing , but his performance is still solid"
116,"i agree , he is 40 ears old but still one of the best qb ont he leage , wonder how much money he makes , must bd w lot"
117,i hear his wife still makes more . power couple
118,she is a famous model or was a famous jodel to think engineers zctually end up winning more tban pro football players
119,i think it is due to the high rate 0f injury leading to early retirement for many players
120,"yeah , dfoogball platers carreers s4em to be short due to injuries , did you hear about the tradking chips they have ?"
121,in their shoulder pads or in the football ?
122,"both , i guess tyat they give all kinds of interesting stats ,"
123,i woner if it is any help in resducing inhjuries
124,"i thinik it could , if you meassure the imp0act nad then find a way to protect the players"
125,i dont' htink protective football gear hase volved much
126,"no , i hear they wanted to chnage certain 4ules to protect players but easier said tyhan done ,"
127,"ina ny case , i hope less people get injured . thwnks for chatting ."
128,are you a fan of nick foles and the eagles ?
129,no . i like the ne wyork giants .
130,i remember the day whne bowlers made more money than nfl players
131,really ? that is very surprising to me . when was this ?
132,i believe it was back in the 60s .
133,i have heard that the highest scoring football game was 2220
134,yeah that was a college game . 9 beklieve it wqas against a division ii tezmn amed cumberlnad
135,yep ! all the way back in 1916 .
136,this years football season has ended and now it is time for the playoffs .
137,the best team trom the nfc will play the best team from the afc . htis is cqlled the superbowl .
138,do you prefr th eamerican version of football or the english or australianv ersions ?
139,the american versio nfor sure .
140,espn has added a field goal lonet o their emmy winning yellow line for fist downs
141,i find it interesting there is no rule preventing women frok playing in the nfl .
142,"i hope to see obne in the nfl sooner , at least as a kicker"
143,that would be intwresting . you may be sjurprised to know that a typical nfl game only has 11 minutes of gameplay .
144,"yeah , i spend hours in front of the tv only to be watching a few swhort minutes of the actual game"
145,it's frustrating when yo put it like that .
146,"that is where they make all 5he money , the ads and constant comemrcials"
147,"teh nfl uses tracking chip son rheir players as we,l ."
148,do youk now why ?
149,jerry jones plays foo0tball .
150,he actually own the dlalas cowboys . apparently he has been pushing for an 18 games eason .
151,"yeah , i thought he was a player , but he is the owner . i like the commerciao with the two football players who make cupcakews ."
152,ha ha . troy aikman disagrees with expanding the seao nby fwo ames on accoutn of the play4rs health and he has many supporters with th4 recen tresearch regarding brain health . i agree with try .
153,does mean sickenss or injuries ?
154,injuries leading to brin damage over time . jonrs has countered by sayin gthey could shorten the p0reseason by two games to even it out and it would be even safer . but i disagre4e with that because eams are more careful with their players in preseason for fear of them being injured for the actual season when it counts .
155,"id on't know . cte is angerous , but rhey can't diagnos8s it officially until someone is dead due to the way the test is performed on the brain ,"
156,true but they seem to be finding a tleast wonme degree of it in the amjority of autopsies they have performed . jones aslo cited more money as a reason to extsnd the season whihc i believe is his only real motivwtion . i find that upsettng when he has to hav emore money than he could possibly spen dat this point . it's veryg reedy .
157,it's greedy and dangerous
158,that's true . it seem sto damage their impulse control . he says the players would make more but there is no guarantee of that and i don't thihk it'sa worth their health . they are already making a staggering amount o fmoney .
159,i think it won't pass . nfl is a big corporatin .
160,i don't think it will either . did you know that the average football game only has 11 minutes o actual live game play ! i kenw that they felt way too tfull of commercials and interruptions .
161,"yes m, the commercial smake al ot of money ."
162,"yes , that is a prije advertising tims . i do not liie the way they trea ttheir cheerleaders . saints cheerleaders aren?t even allowed to eat in the sqme restaurant as players and if a player entsrs and they are already eating . they hav eto stop eating and lave ."
163,that'ds perobably due to xual harassment . there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free .
164,not sure because i also recently found out that fhe cheelreaders make nearly minimum wage which is ridiculous . that's interesting . i know thosew ere the height of entertainmenta t one ;oint but i wonde if they hold up now .
165,radios zre interesting . jupiter has radio stormds so strong that they can be picked up andh eard by an am radio .
166,that's pretty fascinating especialkly given the distance .
167,"yeah , i wonder id laiens listen to music ."
168,i know we have sent music into space just in case .
169,i didn't know that . hopefully soothin gmusic .
170,it's been a while since i heard the list but i know there is some classical in there .
171,do you like the nfl ?
172,yes i do .d id you knowt hat women can play in it as well ?
173,yes there is no rule in place that says that they cannot play
174,yes and if thegy qualify tehy are good to go and play
175,yes . the gfamep;ay is averaged at 11 minutes anyways
176,yes and yet we ard glued to the tv for hours to an end
177,true . did you knoiw engineers make more than footballers over the lifetime ?
178,yes but they also have longer career sso that helps i think
179,yes true . did you hear of that rule for the saints cheerleaders ?
180,ues theg are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players
181,yes and they have to leave mid meal also if they wal in
182,yes it is so sexist and it really needs to go
183,i agree . do you watch much tv ?
184,a lot actually . i like to watch the simpsons and you ?
185,nice me too . there is an episode where bart does not appear
186,yes and he is not even mentuoned in it
187,yea h. how about that 70s show ?
188,yes i like it but in the uk it really flopped
189,yes after just 10 episodes becuse they remade it verbatim
190,yeah their bad and mistake . nice chat
191,same her eans have a good one
192,"hi , do you like nfl ?"
193,"yes , i watch a little . what about you ?"
194,i am big fan ofn fl . the 32 teamsa re great .
195,do you havse a favoriten fl team ?
196,"yes , the team wa new enfland patriots . what is your favorite team ?"
197,"that'a cool , teh new england patriots re my favorite team ,a s well !"
198,that's greazt . and they win the 6 nfl championships .
199,"yes , they are great . did you watch them play in the superbowl in february ?"
200,"e e, i did . it was great ."
201,"yes , it was , but i6t seemed like it took three hours to play . especially , when you consider theaverage fnl game has only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay ."
202,"an average profesaional football game lats 3 hours adn 12 minutes , but icf you tally up the time whent he bll is actually in play , hte action amounts to a more 11 minutes . ppart of the discrepancy has to do wqith the basic rules of american fo0tball ."
203,k fee. there is alot of wasted 6time .
204,"maybe , it was waste of time . the nep owner was robert kraft ."
205,"yes , he's the owner . on a different subject , do you watch teelvis9on ?"
206,"yeah , i watch telegision . because i love watch movies , comedy shoes , adn sports ."
207,"me too ! have you ecer watched , ' thes impsons ' ?"
208,i like the simpsons . it was released in 1989 .
209,did you see the episode hwere bart is enither seen or mentioned ?
210,i watch all 30 seasons . what about you ?
211,"oh , wow , yoyu are a big fan ! i never remember seeing this episode ,t hough ."
212,i also can't remember that series . but i was great .
213,"yes , it was a great show ! well , it has been nice chatting with you thuis morning . i hope you enjoy the rest of your day ."
214,"yes , i really happy to chat with you ."
215,have a good day !
216,good morning ! do you like football ?
217,"hello there , i do enjoy football , both american and internationa,l , how about you ?"
218,i do ! i'm elarning a lo tof jerry jones !h ave you heard of him ?
219,"oh yseah the cowboys onwer , i fhought they wouldf have made z lonhger ru nin this years playoffs , are you a cowboys fan ?"
220,i am ! he is tryingh to expand to 18 vames instead of the 16 they hagve now .
221,"yeah i could agree , if they took to oft he preseason games zawah ."
222,i agree ! who wants to deal with a unexpected brain injury ?
223,exactly ! did you ever see the concussion movie with will smith ?
224,i haven't ! is it good ' did you watch it on tv ?
225,"yeah i thouhgt it was really good , and it really makes you concerned about all of th3 brain damage football players of al lages rake during the game ."
226,i will have to lool that up . i wonder how that would affect female players in the nfl ? 6here i sno written rule against the m.
227,"it hink i read about that , i think it would be so cool if a female play4r did make a roster and madea n impact in the leage ."
228,"one has been drafted ! with only 11 mibnutes of actual plau , maybe rthe chances are ow lof her getting one ."
229,"that is ve4y true , i don't think most people realize just how little actual gameplay there is in games ."
230,the nf ltracking chips that are in the players uniforms have been quit ehandy for finding infl l8ke that out !
231,"yea they sure have , i hope they are using that technolkgy to help with player safety as well ."
232,me too ! have you ever watched the 70's show ?
233,"yeah i sure have , i grew up in wisconsin and had a very similar teen life lol . how about you ?"
234,i just loved watching it ! was a lot of fun ! but did yo7 know they tried to remake it in teh uk amd it bombed ?
235,yeah i heard they did it verbatim and it was really bad !
236,"i guess the uk could nust not relate ! i watch the simpsons , but have you seen f is for family ?"
237,"i love the simpsons , but wish they would have sytopped making the how after seaso n12 or sl ."
238,kinda getting old isn't it ? too bad ! linda like pokemon fo4 me ! my kids loved that show !
239,"that is incredible how many shows they nade . it was nice talking with you , i hope ou have a good day !"
240,hi there ! do you have a football team that you lijke ?
241,"not relaly . i'm no into sports that much , but it's an interesting subject to me . do you have a favorite team ?"
242,i do . i love football facts . i know former nfl'er benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled a football in his nfl career .
243,"i guess recently discoveries have been mad elinking foktball to traumatic brain injury , obviously , but even worse , also degenerative brain disease and chroni cencephalopathy ! i'll be looking more into it , as i said , i'm inteested : ,"
244,i believe it . it is a rough sport .
245,"absolutely ! running back larry johnson is battlin gself destructive impulses and surely cte . it seems unfair to me , to have a sport in which the players are suffering for the rest of their lives !"
246,wow . i ha dno idea of such issus . hard to believe the nfl has no rules against females playin in the league a slong as they can meet eligibility requirements .
247,"shakem yh ead ! and i waqs just reading about it and foumd out that in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top footblal stars ! we should all just go back to bowling ! it's much safer : ,"
248,fars afe4 indeed ! amazing that the average nfl game only hax 11 minutes of live game plwy .
249,"yeah that is amazing ! i would think th eaverage game play wou.d be much longer . hm . i wonder why ! so , it's hard to believe women could play too , but they might not be as offended if they were playing against the university of iowa who paijted the visiting team slocer room p8nk ! ha ! talk about good sportsmanship l ,"
250,no kidring ! did you know th nfl uses tracking chips to track player movement ?
251,jo i didn't ! i hope they put the chips in say the shoes or helmets versus implanting them in the players bodies ! the very idea of tracking chips scares me !
252,they put hte chips in the players shoulder pads sot hey can 6rack every move the player makes ont he field .
253,"oh whew ! okay . that isn't sooo bad : , i wonder why the new orleans saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat at the same restaurant as any nfl player ! i heard that if the cbeerleader is eating at a restaurant and any player comes in , she has to leave ! that's absurd !"
254,"so8nds sexist if yoh ask me . an engineer's average lifetime salary is hjgher than that of an nfl player . not as exciting , but interesting ,"
255,"sokmehting tells me that being an negineer is much safer than beinjg an nfl player . hard to say which job would be more satisfying or more worthy o fdoing . considering engineers get paid more , i'd go wit hthat job !"
256,i would agree . it is notable though that it is only a 17 week regulr playings eason for nfl teams .
257,"oh wow ! if that is per year , i'd love to only work 4 months and 1 week a year . but i'm sure they have to practice and do other things , like media events throughout the yea4 . so maybe i will look into being sn engineer and put my football dreamsb ehind me . haha . kidding of coirse : ,"
258,i would too . it was really nice chatting with you today !
259,thanks ! same to yu ! i hope you have a wonderfu lday !
260,goodby e!
261,goodbye !
262,"hey , there , fellow chatter ! ho war you doing ?"
263,good thansk . how are you ? eo you like football ?
264,"i enjoy the sport called football , but i do not watch it much . you ?"
265,i don't watch it a lot either . i dont really understand it thoug hespn's superimposed line does help a lot . they won ane mmy for it .
266,"must have been a weak field of competition that year .n ext year , they change the color , and wi another award ."
267,haha . it's amazing how muxh popularity football has gained . in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars
268,"bolers had the ideal physique in the day , is my guess . people wanted to look liket hem , in their polyester pants and multicolored shoes ."
269,"oh , yes ! wel , maybe if i was aroun dfor the footbll game where a team lost 0222 , i would be interested kn football ."
270,could you make moneh on the gam ethough ? and was there just 11m jnutes of acxtion in that game ?
271,haha there would hae had to be ore right ? !
272,"the cumberland p,ayers would have made more money as engineers ."
273,i find it interestingy that average earningfs of engineers is higher than average of fooball players
274,plus there are fewer concussions in engineering . probabl engineers have better helmets . no cheerleaders though .
275,"yeah , too bad there is no respect for the cheerkeaders in nfl . saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant even if they are already eating , if players waht o eat thers ."
276,i guess the cheerleaders havbe to wear trackingc hip sso that the team knows whatr estaurant they're ij .
277,"haha , yeah i find ig cool how technology has advanced so much in th enfl but i certainly hope trackng isn't necezsary off the field ."
278,"that would be terrible for the players , but perhaps quite entertaining for fan s. speaking of entertainment , did you ever play the nes ?"
279,i used to ! it only had 54 colors !
280,"and plwnty of games . it got retired in 2003 , wlel before it's time . it should have been here for another century ."
281,"haha , true but i would have though i retired way befotre 6then !"
282,"too many people loved that little system . anyway , i enjoy3d the chat !"
283,yeah 8i did too !
284,"hi there , hope you are havin ga good afternoon . when you hear the word football , do you think of american or canadian footbqll or rugby ?"
285,"i actually think of soccer lol ,"
286,"wel l, so do al ot of people around the world ! it's funny that hte top bowlers in 1906 made more than the op nfl players . i'm sure that's not true anymore for american football or soccer !"
287,"i dontt hink its true anymore , pro football and soccer players make a ton of money , bowling was a popular sport back then , not as much today"
288,"ye , the games have changed ovr hte years . like hen espn started superimposing the yellow first down line over the field . they won an emmy for that , which is als amazing !"
289,i guessed the cretion of the lin3 is of great contribution to the game not only back then but it changed the game forever
290,"it macde history for sure . speaking of history , i've seen a few georgia tech gzames when i lived close by but wow , their score of 2220 made the history books as the highest ever score !"
291,"hqt is a yumiliaring defeat , i wonder i fthe other team was blind"
292,can' treally imagine howt hat happened ! what else fo you enjoy for entertainment ? did you play nintendo back in the day ?
293,"i did , i liked it , it was primitive only 54 colors right ?"
294,"yes . hard to imagine back then , whaty game systems would become . ajpan continued to sell them until 2003 but then they finally stopped ."
295,"i guess nobody was buing them anymore , still a great system , i used to play the mario gajes in that console and then nintendo 64"
296,my kids also lovedb ill ney the science guy too ! i never thought he looked like steve martin but apparently he won a lookalike contest !
297,"they look like twin brotheres lol , that show was really fun , i liked it , was ifnormative and interesting"
298,"ronald regan was another tv and movie star , andh e even playef a footbnall player too . funny that he lost a oart because he did look presidential !"
299,"that is funny ! they had jt all wrong then ,"
300,"qnother thing i think is wrong is that the new orlean's football team makes their cheerleade5s leave a resturant if a player comes in , i geft that they don't ant them to socialize but that seem wrong on several levels ."
301,"i heard about that rule nd it makes me so angry , that is really unfair to cheerleaders having tol eave in teh midle of your meal just befcause a player comes in , makes me really angry"
302,i gues sthey would be better off being an engineer than cheerleaders anyway . engieners have a much higher lifetime earning than nfl players do !
303,"maybet hats becaus ethey tend to have longer carreers but i agree , football also causes brab damage and unwanted injuries"
304,"right andr hwo wants that . i guess the cheerleaders could also go out for the team , since there is no ban ofg female playersx ! then they wouldn't bave to leave an dthey wouldn't get hea dinjuries very often either !"
305,"i gues sthey could also play , they can switch roles and it will be the other way around"
306,hi how are you ? do you like s0orts ?
307,"hi there , i;m good thank ou . i love sports ! how about you ?"
308,i like basketball and football . soemtimes i grt a chance to watch .
309,"i used to be really into basketball when i wasa growing up , i still watch my favodite team though . do you know what the highest grossing basketball movie ever was ?"
310,i enjoyed playingw hen i was younger . i try to watch the finals . theh ighest grossing ? what ?
311,the top grossing basketball movie ever ? it was space jam . did you hear there is another dpace jam in the works ?
312,another one ? with lebron ? i guess that makes xense . the producers probbaly waited jntil another supersta rappeared .
313,"yeah i thinks o , i think lebron will be thge star of the movie ."
314,"yeah , he just mskes so much money . endorsements , salary . it is amazing ."
315,"he sure doe s, i wonder if he is maong the top grossing athletes aroudn the world ?"
316,he makes so much money . i wonder when he'll retiee . je is about 34 years old .
317,"he is , and i don't think he will for another few years yet . do you fol.ow the nfl at all '"
318,"i tryt o watch the super bowl , and maybe the playoffs ."
319,"yeah i always watch the auper bowl , i mostly follow my team . the playoffs are always exviting as well ."
320,i usually root for the underdog in the superbowl . i like to seem the long shot do well .
321,"i think i usually do the same . did you there is a high schoo lfootball stadium in texas that seats 18 , 000 ?"
322,in texas ? im not surprised . football i sa religion in texas .
323,"yeah they love foobtall down there , especialy high school dootball , i think they rake it very seriously ."
324,"yeah , the fans probably wanted a bigger stadium too . anyway , great cht !"
325,"i guess it cost 6 0million to make , wow . yeah same to you it was fun cahtting ."
326,hae a good night !
327,"thank you , i hope ypu do too !"
328,do you watch the nfl ?
329,"i am a big fan of the nfk , how baout you ?"
330,"i am , but i don't like that there is only 11 minutes of gameplay ."
331,it is sort of frustratin gthat there is so little actual gameplay . sometimes it does jot feel that way though .
332,"yeah , did you know that an engineer on average makes more than an nfl player ?"
333,i know a lot of players have short careers s they don't make as much as the elite players in the league .
334,interesting . cid you know that iowa's locker rooms are painted pink for the visiting team ?
335,i did not know that . i wonder if they think that will throw off th3e visiting team's performance ?
336,i think ig does
337,i don't see that playing a factor with teams thes days . i wouls like to hear an opposing school talk about it
338,"yeaj . well , you are probably better off being an engineedr than an nfl player ."
339,i would imagine that being an ehgineer comes with a lot less health risks such as brain daamge !
340,ha6 is for sure ! did you know that in the 06s bowlers made more than football players ?
341,"i know some of the philadelphia eaglwes had to have offseason jobs in th e60s . htat's how hcuck bednarik earned hte nickname ' concrete charlie ' , he sold concrete when hte season was over ."
342,"that's crazy , vut i can believe it . maybe thwy shou.ld have been bowlers ?"
343,i would be curious to know why bowlers were being paid so well then .
344,i suppose there were al ot of fanjs for bowlers . in 39 out of 50 states the highest paid state employe3 is a footabll or basketball coach .
345,i think it's pretty crazy that some of these coaches get paid so much . the schools could use taht for better purposes ;.
346,"yeah , it must be a huge suck on the resohrces for students education ."
347,i know they bring a lot of revenue in for schols and you wnqat the best candidtesd fo rthe job kb ut ther professors must feel real cheated by those salaries .
348,"i hear yah , ut i be ti fthey are tenured they gef paid pretty well ."
349,ar eyou a football fan ?
350,yea i watch the nfl and a little college . i'm glad to see danny johnson made it onto 5he redskins despite playibg at southern university
351,yes ! did you knowt hatt he university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink ?
352,"yea , i guess iowa was trying to psych out htev isitinb teams by painting the lockers pink"
353,no d9oub t. lol in the 1960's top bowl4rs made twice as juch as thet op football stars of the day . times haqve sure changed since then .
354,"yea , espm won an emmy for it's coverage of the nfl , it's never won an emmyf or its bowling coverage"
355,lo; i lovet hats uperimposed line they created .
356,"yea . it's go bad ther4 was not tv when geodgia tech beat cumberland 2220 , i'd love to see highlights of that"
357,talk about a blowout !
358,"yea , i wonder how much live gameplay that game had since te nfl averages 11 minutes"
359,"lo, did you know that the nfl has no written rule that prevent sfemales frokm playing ? mqybe we'll sew one someday . maybe a kicekr ?"
360,"possobly , i wonder if a female player was on the saints if she wouls not be allowed to be in the same public places as the male players like 6he cheerleaders are"
361,isn't that an odd rule toh ave ? i don't get it .
362,"ye , the saints rules sounds really outdated an dsexist"
363,"i agree . what do you think of the tracking chips tehy are putting in the playere shoulder pads wnd fpotballs ? they claim it's to track the palyes moves on the field and to track the velocity , etc . of hte balls ."
364,"it's pretty interesting , i know in baseball people are making a big eal ou tof trafking ball speed andv elocity"
365,it's crazy . i'm wondering with the chips inf ootall could they be programmeed so that say the chip in the ball is programmed to go to the the chip in the shoulder pad ? seems kind of shady . . .
366,"i guess so but it might be cool if they pu fhips in basketbqol , i'd love to know how much force kareem abduljabbar's dunk ahd"
367,ir emember him ! he was famous for his hook shot and in college he dunke dso much tha tthey banned it fir almost a decade ! it's bene fun hcatting with you !
368,"yea , i wonder i jabbar ever coached , they are the highest pai demjployees in 39 of 50 states"
369,c4azy that those college coaches are paid tha5 uch ! have a good one !
370,good morning ! do you like football ?
371,hey ther e. yes i love football . i am sad that the nfl season is over .
372,i ma too . a 71 week regular season is just too shor t.
373,yeah i agree especially with only 11 minutes of average gameplay per game .
374,"they definitely should make that longer . ay , i've heard that women can play if th3ey want to and meet the requirements . do you thinj they should ?"
375,i think they should if they are good enough but they shouldn't irf they are smart . it is such a rbutal game . and tehy dont' make all that much because of injuries .
376,"yeah , the average lifetime earnings of a nengineer are higer tha nthat of an nfl player and a mlb player ."
377,did you hear how t5he saints cheerleaders can't interact with the players ?
378,i think i have . isn't that wh3re if a cheerleader is in a restaurant and a player comes in she has to leave ?
379,yeah exactly . the nfl even track splayer movements using tracking hcips !
380,you mean on the field right ?
381,yes on the field ! the put it in their shoulder pads and also the vootball itself !
382,wo2 ! i knew a little about the football bur i had no idea they had chips on the players too .
383,yeah no wonder they can get such good accurate stats !
384,you know you're right ! it does make sense when you think about it . i woder if they'll ever use those chips liken asca rdoes theur cars and be able to tell if players make touchdowns and first downs .
385,good question . i also reaolly likjet he yellowf irst down marker when watchinhg games on tv . espn won an emmy for that .
386,i like that too . it makes theg ame more intense and exciting hwen you see how far a twam has to go to make the firs t6down .
387,agreed . i wodner if the nba uses chjips to track stats too ? there is even a bball court on top of the usa supreem xourt biilding .
388,"hmm , i never thought about that . if they don't , they should . that bball court you're talking about by the way is called the highest court in tuhe land ."
389,oh very cool . wonder if anyone famous haz played there ? karesm abulp jabbar used to have such a dominant dunk that it got banned on college !
390,ikt got banned ? he must have been overpowering teakms and winning all the time !
391,hello !
392,"helo , do you have good knowledg eabout football players ?"
393,i am not a uge fan of football but i like basketball . . . .
394,same ! i like basketball . i am a big fan ot the golden state warriors . how about you ?
395,"cool , i am a big fan of phoenix suns . . . my team !"
396,nice ! have you been to a gmae ?
397,"yes , not too many but a few . how about you ?"
398,a few ws well . i always go to the stadium early to receive bobbleheads of the basketabll palyers .
399,"that's awesome , i have a couple of those too but bought them from wa friend ."
400,"awww man , i hope they are worth the price . reading from the factual section e , i agree that space jam is the highestgrossing basketball movie . have you wathed it ?"
401,i think i have but it has been a long time lol . . . . i too think it is itneresting that the us supreme court building has ab asketball court on the top floor how cool is thatr !
402,that is cool . i guess they need some wxercise after a ahrd day's work .
403,true ! basketball is definitely good exercise lol
404,do you play ?
405,"i did back in school but not anymore . i play softball on al eagu though and its pretty fun , how about you do you play any sports ?"
406,"it's been a while since i played a sport . i used to play basketball , but now it's al about tennis and badmitnon . of course in this kind of weather is a no no ."
407,"yea , i live in a warm climate so we play sports more in cooler weather when its 70s and 80s outside ."
408,"for sure , i bet . i am waiting until the sun comes up ."
409,have you ever played f0otball at all or evrt har a team you like in the nf l?
410,"well , in middle school , but hot a fan . i only like the 48ers . it is vbecause of mu relatives ."
411,"oh , yeah . . . i only wach sometimes because of friende lol"
412,it was nice talking to you . happy new year .
413,happy new year ! ! ! bye !
414,how is it going ? do you like football ?
415,"hello ! i am . i prefer college , but i am pumped for the playoffs this weekend !"
416,awesome ! i don't keep up with football much . hwo is in the playoffs ?
417,"'there are four teams from the national ans americna foo5ball conferences . the nfch as la rams , cowboys , eagle s, and saints . the afc has kc , la cwhrgers l ne , and indiamapolis ."
418,"oh ok , i obly know some of those . its iinda crazy to think the nfl actual gameplay is nly like 11 min when it usually last about 34 hours !"
419,"that is crazy ! to think they spend all htat money , going as far a stracking a.most every move of a player through specially designed chips for such a relstiv4 short time of actual game play ."
420,"i heard about that too , technology has improved so many things , lije also when you arew atching fo0otball they can draw on the screens and show different plays and when the line is they highlight it . they also have amazing playback or forwar drep;lays !"
421,great point . how many of us are indebted to madden for breaking down football like that ?
422,"probably millions lol football has some weird customs , what is with a tdeam painting the opposing teams locker room pink ?"
423,"ah , i know that team all too well . that's iowa who is my team's rival as we are neighbofing states ."
424,oh i see . dok you know what the tactic or custom is ? why do they aint it pink ?
425,"i am pretty sure it was hayden fry , who hte old tv show ' coach ' was looseoy based on , . i think it sas that te pink would demotivate the opposition or make them lose their edges ."
426,"ah i see , maybe to soften them up i guess . that's pretty smart , unlesst hey knew about it zalready . did you kno wthere is a football player tha tnevere fumbled in his whole career ? why isn ; t this guy more sough tour after lol that sounds incredible l."
427,"wow . maybe he just isn't as explosive as others , but it's pretty 8impressive ."
428,i know right ! i believe he played for the patrios .
429,"do you lke any other sports , like basketball ?"
430,"kinda the sqme , i do not follow it much . i watch the warrios sometimes though , how about you ?"
431,"i watch a little . i will admit that the sarriorsa re not my favorite team . i guess it's because they are so good , but i have to remember tuat they really built that team from scratch and then added amazing players around what they drafted l"
432,"yeah , true . i find it funny that the inventor of basketball is the only losing couch in kansas university history lol"
433,"i wonder how much he got paid fo rthat ? in the vast majority of states today , the college baskwtgall or ootball coach is the highest paid employee ogf the state ."
434,"hmmm good questioin . i hope he gets some sort of royalties lol this sport has blown up , it is so popular and generates so muc hmoney ! anyways its been good talking to you !"
435,i love the nfl i cant wait for the season to start back up ! 17 weeks is not enough ! do you like football ?
436,i have a passijng knowledge
437,thats grest ! do you watch foorball or just keep up with it in general ?
438,mainly watching it time to time
439,cool ! i really likeh ow hightech they are getting addingnm icro chips into players pads snd the floytball or . it makes the game fun !
440,they sure get a lot of data . i wonder what they use it for
441,ive heard football xpeed when through and other stuff . funny that the biggest thing for them wsas th eaddition of the yellow first rown line . won tehm an emmy !
442,that was bye spn righg ?
443,yeah ! reallt cool tha something so simple had such a huge impact ! nofthing like inh ovckey when they highlighted the puck .
444,"i mean considering there is only a dozen or so minutes of real gameplay , any help understanding what is going on is a huge plus"
445,true 2 they dont even play that much ! if they are only playing for 11 minutes they figure out a way to amke games more fun . tyou know . . make a game with some huge scirs like 200 or soethoing .
446,the winner were just that yood and the losers just that bad i guess
447,i bet youre right . you really need a poor team to go nothing against a team that scores 222 . i dont even know who cumberland is . .
448,i mean the winners must have had talent like tom brady o rgreen ellis
449,i always that greenellis was great . he wa samazing and i think never fumlbed the ball . ever !
450,indeed . that is an impressive feat
451,yeah it is ! i dont think he even got paid that well . noghing lioel eveon bell nad his 1 3million a year
452,well at least these players are much better paid now thaj in the 1960s when even bowprs made more
453,ain't that the truth ! for how physicql the gaem is they should be getting paid a lot .
454,it is a dangerous contact s;ort aftsr all . it is probably due to foced early retiremen ttaht the average football player's lifetime eanrings is less than thzt of engineers
455,yes it is . have a great day !
456,to youa s well .
457,are you a fan of the nfl ?
458,nfl ? the national football league ? i dont really konow it 2well . you ?
459,"yea that is , do you know any of the 32 teams ?"
460,"yeah , i g8ess i have hearc some names . the patriots is one that i hear a lot"
461,"yea they keep winnin gsuper bowls anr have the greatest quarterabck of all time , tomb rady . you don't watch much nf l, do you watch collegef ootball much ?"
462,"no , i dont . i guess the ga,e is more fun at the college level . the kid probably enoy paying the game ."
463,"yea , my favorite team is iowa , 5hey paint their visiting lkcker room pink"
464,"i wonder if that has any ecfect all . if so , i would expecte vertone to do it ."
465,"i wonder also , i would have to check their home record o see a trend . are you ab asketball fan sinxe you don't watch much football ?"
466,"i like basktball , but i usually watch around the playoffs . i like golden state . you ?"
467,"me too , i liek the buls , bht golden state is fun to watch . do you know who james naismith was ?"
468,he was the guy who invented thes port .h e was canadian i believe .
469,"he was the worst coach in ,ansas history , you think he could have rigged te game in his favor"
470,he might ahve had bad players too . maybe he juat didnt get the strategy . oh well . i think he has an award named after him .
471,"for sure , i eardt hat also . so you ever cathc anything on espn ?"
472,"no , htough it guess it is insanely popular . sports all the time would be a big hit in the usx ."
473,they won an espy for their yellow line on tv
474,an espy ? i dont know that award . the yellow line ?
475,"sorry they won an emmy , lol ! tha6 is a big thing for something so small"
476,"oh , an emmy . yeah , the tv award . a yellow lien ? hm . a weak year for awarss . anyway , great chat !"
477,"you tyoo , it was so nice cha5ting with yo9u !"
478,"hello , do you like football ?"
479,"i do like football smetimes , not all the time , but sometimes . you ?"
480,"i watch a few games a year , but i do not keep up with it at all ."
481,"i try to watch the playofs , maybe the superbowl ."
482,thats cool . did you know the nfl has no written rule against feale players ?
483,"i have heard that , but i don't thionk that women can qualitfy . it's a tough game"
484,"yeah , just depends on the woman . i hear the nfl uses tracking chips on the players and football ."
485,"i aould like to see a woman that coudl o that . i have no problemw ith that l i fshe can play , let her in . put the tracking chips on her ."
486,the average gae play of w football game is 11 min ! it takes like 3 hours usually to see the whole event lo.
487,"those players spend a lot of time standing around amd waiting . i figured that 11 minutes was a bit sxhort , but now htat i think about it , it sounds right ."
488,"lol yeah i know right ! so many time outs , foul s, huddles , etc ."
489,"yes , basketbal lis a sportt hatf lows a lot more ."
490,"i agree , a lot of consistant action ."
491,basketbal;l was injvented by a canasian . a canadian
492,lol cool . i hear the inventor of basketball is the only losing coach in the u7niversity of kanas history . ironi c.
493,"he really could not coach . i guess he knewh ow to create game , not play them ."
494,"yeah , thats ufnortunate . i hope he gets royalties o something , rhis game has blown up ! it vgenerates so much m9ney !"
495,"yes , it has . the college coaches make so much . it seems like a distortion of the purpose f college ."
496,yeah 39 out of 50 states ths highest paid employee is the college basketball or football coach .
497,"i wonder where this all going to lead . soon the degreegrantinga epect of college will become optional extra . anyway , greatc hat !"
498,great speaking with you .
499,hi do you follow football ?
500,"i am a fan yeah , do you have a favorite team ?3 2 teams 2 division 1 winner"
501,my favorite team is the buffalo bils . lol th euniversity of 8owa painted theirv isitors locker room pink . i think the bills might have stepped in there once . lol
502,how did they do past sason ? and that ijs funng lol a pink locker room fo rthe visiting team
503,hte biols didn't do well . they rarely do well . haven't been good ince the jim kelly days . in the1 960's top bowlers made twice as much as top rootball stars did back then . that's sure chagned now .
504,"twice as much woah , that is impressive , thqts a lot of money , things have changed a lot for players over the years"
505,hes ! former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the ball i his nfl career . impressive !
506,"that is impressive , did you hear about coach matt patricia ?"
507,i haven't heard of him . waht did he do ?
508,"he is a rocket scientist sand also a coach , he must be a really smart man ."
509,i bet ! i'll havet o looi him p . espn won an emmy for creating the yellow superimposed first down line on tv .
510,"i guess the yellow line is a big contribution to the game , also the tracking chips ,t hose seekm great also ."
511,"yes i agree ! the nfl has no written rule agaunst female p,ayers . wonder if any gave ever tried out ?"
512,there's no writte nrule against female players freally ? i guess we wont see them play in the league as its a physical game
513,i know . maybe as a kicker maybe . an average nf lgame only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
514,"only 11 minutes ? that seem sreally ufair , so skince the re introduction of the nfl in 9199 the aqb with mostw ins is be nroethlisberger"
515,that must be in the lceveland bowns stadium ?
516,"i fthink h eplayed for the steeelrs , he must be a hall of famer ."
517,he is their current qb . the highes score evwr for a footval lvgame was when georgia twch beaf cumberland 2220 . it's beenf un chatting !
518,"oh i see , didnt know he still played and thwt is a humiliating loss , hope you have a nice day , its been fun chatting bye ."
519,have a good day !
520,"hi , how are you ?"
521,"i a mwell , ow are you ?"
522,i am well . do you know anything about virginia footbvwll ?
523,i know that virginia football yas benre trying to fix it's prograqm with a new athletic director . they have not been doing well in past seasons .
524,they have not . their basketball program has been better under tony bennettf .
525,is tony bennett new to the basketball program ?
526,"no , he's been there for af ew years . got them up to a top 5 rank . slow and boringt o wa6ch though ."
527,i am hoping that the football team will do better this year . they only won 6 games this year .
528,yesah . i think they hsould be bette . ht4eyve got a good recruiting base there .
529,tey're trying to get the recruitment ev4en better . they zre also adding a footall ope3ratikns center to draw even more attentikn .
530,nice . clemson just added something like that and it yas a rrecording stdio in there for theier players !
531,that reminds me that tne suprene court building has a basketball court on the top floor .
532,that's a strabnge place for it . i wonder how otten thd notorious rbg plays . . .
533,zhew ill ge tdnking banned like kareem abduljabbar
534,i oftne get those two confused . . . the higest paid coach in many states is their basketball or football coach .
535,an amusing contrast to the fasct that the players are no paid anything
536,yeah . really sad for them . i don't feel like free education is enough for many of these player s.
537,through free schooling in exchange for about 11 minutes ofg ameplay sems like a good deal .
538,"when put like that , yes that seems like a great deal !"
539,hopefully the whole department can work together and improve htings for both he players nd te staff
540,yeah . nice chatting with you !
541,did you know steve spurrier coach the redskins ?

547,"oh i see , it was a long time ago , i heard he also led a team called the tampa bay banitw ."
548,"yeah , he's been around quite a bit . that's just crazy though that the reskins don't even have him listed on their web site when listing past coaches ."
549,"they dont ? i wonder if thats because of an internal prble m, he was one of the highest paic coaches in nfl while on the team"
550,"i am sure because they are embarrassed . . . but come on , you hired him !"
551,"he has 12 victories in 32 games so maybe thats why he got fired , i think the team had high hopes on him ."
552,i am sure htey did . . . that's just disrespectful and childhs . . . there are a lot worwt coaches out there !
553,"there sure are , speaking of lack of respect the lockers for the vositing team o fthe university of iowa are painted all link"
554,"omg . . . that's just mean ! ! ! ho2 about the disrespect the ne worleans saints cheereladers g4 t. when a play4er come into a restaurant , even if the cheerleader was there before the player the cheerleader has to leave !"
555,"that is really rude and sexist , i mean why do htey have to leave if they dont wamt players mixing with cheerleader why dont make it both ways ."
556,exactly ! ! ! it's the nfl playing god ! ! ! geez ! ! !
557,"i get you , so heres a cool act you know benjarvus green el.lis ? he used to be an rb in tye patriot sand he never fumbled a ball ."

567,"no , who is benjadvus green elli s? i mnot sure i remember that player"
568,"he was the rb years ago , he never fumbled the ball once in his career !"
569,never fumbled the ball ? wgoa that is really impressive not many playrrs can say that maybe he is the only one .
570,"rjght , they fumble all the time now . hve you heard of the university of iowa ?"
571,"yeah i have heard of it , they have a nice tootball team ."
572,"they are good ,t hey are my hometown team and alma mater ! they paint their locker rooms pink for the opponents"
573,"they do ? i think that is ar eally funny strategy i wonder i fit works , it must confuses ome teams ."

578,"yea , crazy , you think he woul dhave rigged it in his favor ro win som emore games !"
579,"i know right , if you invent the gam ethen you can also bent the rules a bit ,m did you know about the court in the top of the supreme court ?"
580,no way ! i an j8st picture ginsberg throwing down a 36 dunk in it
581,"its called the highest court on land , cop lname and yea thwt would be funn7y lol"
582,"nice , that is a cool place , i wonder if it actually gets used . it was so nice chatting with you , enjoy your dqay !"
583,hey did ylu know in the 60's the top bowlers made 2 xas much as teh top football players ?
584,"hello th4re , no w0w i didn't know that . that is pretty crazy to think how muc hhas changed since then ."
585,"ya i don't even know how much bowlers make now , probably only the top ones make decent money now"
586,yeah i would say you are right . did you know tha tah igh school football stadium in texas cos t60 million to build ;
587,"no thats crazy , espeicaslly for high school hwich is not serious and i'd imagine doesn' generate close to taht much revenu , i woner why thsy spen6t so much"
588,"yeah that is a c5azy maount of moneyf or high school football . i guess it seats 18 , 00 0! !"
589,"ooof , i don't know i don't personally like football that much do you ? this says the average nfl game only has 11 minutes o flive gameplayw hich doesn't surprise me haha"
590,holy cow that is very little . i guess you don't noice so much whil ewatching it on tv .
591,"no but it makes sense , there?s lots of them positikninga nd replays and referee scalling stuff , like the actual qaction is oinly 11 minutes that'sv ery wild t6o me but it makes sense"
592,yeah it does when you think about it . do you know what year was the fvirst nfl playotf game ?
593,i don't was it in the early 1900's ?
594,yeah it was in 1932 on an 80 yard dirt field in chicago . i bet that was pretty rough being tackled on .
595,"oooof ya that sounds like it would hurt , i saw on youtube the first tema to have helmets with symbol son them weret he rams , one teammate just painted the circular horns on his helmet one day"
596,"that is aqwesome , old football stories are pretty interestin . are you a basketball fan as well ?"
597,"not som uch but i do watdh gamez from time to time . i'm mor eof a tennis gfan , i like that there is no tweam and it is 100 percent on one perso nto win or lose"
598,"yeah i like htem both ,m i am a sports fan in general . i always said i would get into hockey if i had a local team to cheer for ."
599,"oh what area do you live in ? i'm in detroit so most people ar ered wings fans , but il ike pittsburgh cuz thats where a lot of my family is from"
600,i am from wisconsin and wse don't have a team in this state .
601,"ah that is true , ya you'd think b3ing so far north that they would obviously have a tea m, and being close to canada haha"
602,yeah that is true . at least we have a pro nfl 6team .
603,"what i didn't know is the average lifetime earmings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl play ror mlb player , o naerage"
604,"w9w i would never have guessed that , maybe b4cause they are working more years . it was nice taloking with you today ."
605,hi ho ware ylu today ?
606,"i'm grweat , it's reqlly inspiring to hear about how steve spurrier played so hard in his day and earned the reputation to garmer the highest paying coaching position in historg ."
607,"yeah , and did you know that he actually coached the redskns for two seasons ?"
608,"yes that's exactly the position i am referring to , they paid him almost 25 million for a five yesr contract . i wonder why he onlyc pached two seasons ."
609,"yeah really , ahha . in the 1960's top bowlers made as mauch a stop footall stars"
610,"wow , i could have done that since bowling is a lot easier than football ! but apparently nfl players really don't make as much as other careers , like engineers ."
611,really ? dhouyld acv been an engin4eer .
612,"yess eriously but some of us lack math skills . ir sounds like it's tough workin in athletics , ca nyou belief new orleans saints cheerleaders aren't even allowed to eat at the same restaurant as an nfl player ?"
613,i xcan't believe that . i wonder why ? how about the highest score ver in 1916 when grorgia tech beat cumberlajnd 2220 .
614,theya re southern so maybe they just have a very prim and proper reputation to protec t. that was craz6 . it makds me wonder if they rigged it ! it rdminds me of great gatsby talking about the world series being rigged around the same year .
615,yeah ! i was supeized to read that a former rb patriots benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball in his entire football careder . that's amazing !
616,"yeah seriously , we'e come a long way since then considering that we noiw cn track players with chipst o know everything about the9irs peed , velocity , rotation and more ."
617,true . did youk now the un8versity of iowa painted the visiting team's locker room pick . they got a prstty good sense of humor .
618,oh i hope they were good sports about it .
619,"i totally meant pink . glad you got that . yeah , i'm sure they were ."
620,wow i dind't evne read 9t as anything but pink haya . i could imzgine foobtall can get pretty aggressive an dcompe5titive hwen so much income is involved .
621,oh yeah ! it's pretty cool that there are so many variations of football . they are known as football codes .
622,"i can never get in to football , you only ever get to see like eleven minutes of actual live gameplay per game !"
623,htat's true .t he rest is comercials . atlhough i do lkove teh new superbowl commercials . hgose are fun .
624,i also enjoy watching the superbowc ommercials . iw onder if watchinvg superbowl commercials was aways so possible even back in teh ealry day sin the 70s
625,i wonder too . i'll have to look it up . i just found out that espn created the yellow line represtenting the first donw line for football .
626,ia lways saw that on tv but neve rbefore thought baout where that ake from . didr you hear they wo nan award for that ?
627,"yeah , theu won an emmy . pretfy awesome . i wonder who came up with it ? it had to start with one person ."
628,probably somd network graphic designer guy or team i guess .
629,"happy holkidays , nice talking to you ."
630,do you like football ?
631,"i'm a fan of all sports , but football happens to be one of my favorites and i follow the nf lclosely . you ?"
632,i don't really watch it that much . i did watch the super bowl which is the first sunday in february .
633,"o h, did you hear anything about wya's been going with le'veon bell this past season ?"
634,i heard eh is back in pittsburgh .
635,"he held out thi yea5r , hoping to get a big contract from pittsburgh or bevome a frsee agent next yer . gyou wouldn't believeh ow muh he mobey he cost himself ."
636,"855 , 000 a week . is that really true ? wow !"
637,"y4ah that's years and years ofv salary for me lol . he will likelyg et a huge3 contract this summer , he's one of the best running backs in footblal ."
638,"right , but i guess since nfl playerxs don't play for so many years , the average lifetime earnings of engineers are higher ."
639,"yeah , you have to figure we mostly hear about the top players 3who make a ton , but the average guys don't make as much as say le'veon bll . i think the average career is like w few years in the nfl ."
640,he made 12 . 1 million in 2017 but had no tbeen paid anything this seaskn .
641,ribht . did you know they track player and football movement now through chips ?
642,"yeayh , lots of cool technology in football these xays ?. espn got an emmy for the superimpose dyellow line ."
643,i can't imagine watching football without that gyellow line . do you like basketball better than football ?
644,i do find basketball more interesting . i find it funny that the inventor of basketball is the only losing coach in the universi6y of kansas's history .
645,hahat hat is funny . must have been a while ago . do yu have a favorite team or player ?
646,i guess the golden state warriors since ia m from that area . how about you ?
647,i'm a nicks fan . not a lot of good things to saya bout them these days . they have a tough time putting 5 decent guys on the court .
648,i like seeing basketball players slam dunk ;
649,"me too , it was banned periodicallyf rom college basketballi"
650,that was becaus eof kares abdul janbar right ? pretty funny !
651,hi do you like basketnall ? did you know the inventof of basketball is the only losing coach in the university of kansas? hidtory ?
652,i do follow basketball clksely from time to time and no i didn't know thata bout 9nventor of basketball .
653,"i do n9t know a lot about the sporr but i do know about a few playefs , like kareem abduljabbar . his dunk shotg ot bnaned from college basketball ."
654,wow ! ! do you know the length of this particular hzn ?
655,apparently they banne dthe dunlk for over a decade .
656,thanks i didn't know this . how many points is a field goal worth in basketball ?
657,i just learned a field goal is wort two pints but i thought field goal qwere in football not baskdtball .
658,thanks . how much is it worth bheind the three point line ?
659,i think it is worth thre and that is why it has the name three point line . but i know so little of the sport . i know that basketbalk games cant' tie and must play overtime for a winner .
660,does tiem stop when someone gets fouled in basketbal l?
661,"yes . i just lerned after a foul , time played stops and the player fouled against or designate dto shoot a technical foul is giv3n one or more onepoint free throws ."
662,thank you som uch . you mentioned earlier about teh inventor of basketball do you know by any chsnce his name ?
663,"yes . his name is james naismigtnh . he was a colleg ecoahd . in 39 out of 50 states , the highest paid state employee is either the college football or basketball coach ."
664,thansk . i didn't know anything about this . very intwresting . do you kow howm any players are in each team that play basketball ?
665,i know when the game is active there are five players each on the court . i am not sure how many or on the bench .
666,thaks . i heard that the new zealabd basketball team have a nickname do you knoww hat they are called ?
667,i just learned they are nicknamed the ' tll blacks . ' i htink they coild have come up with a more appropriate name .
668,me too ! ! they could of come with a muc hbetter name than that .
669,"here's a fub fact , the us supreme court building has a basketball cort on the op floor and it is kn9wn as ' the highest court in thel and '"
670,i'm very surprised with thyis fact . thanks for chatting with mr today . i hope you have a nice evening ! ! !b ye
671,thanks for chatting as well . k learned a lot of new and fun informatio n. goodbye .
672,"hi , how are doing this fije evening ?"
673,"good . enjoying some of the extra t9ime i have now that teh nfl deason is over . the season runs for 17 weeks , s it lasts a few monhts"
674,quite true . i didn't get a chance to watch the sb . i'm surprised that zn averag enfl game has only 11 minutes of acxtion . i though tit would be more .
675,i guess all the stops adn talks about stats make it seem longer . i wonderh ow they kept tracl of all the stats before they embedcded tje ball anc shoulder pads with chips to measure
676,"i think the chips f9or tracking are good . i bet it helps with strategy , but also maybe with profiling injuries ."
677,it's possibl e. did you know womenc an play in the nfl if they meet eligkbility requiements ? i'm surprisedb y that .
678,"i guess fo rsome positions , it couldw ork . kicker . punter . place holder ."
679,"maybe . there's still a risk , but at least the playoffs are single elimination rather than best out of 4 pike the mlb"
680,"i think it would create controversy , which the league likes because it attracts viewers . then again , would you rather have your dauguteer be a nfl player , or an engineee ?"
681,"engineering is a yhard field for women too due to discrimination , but over a lifetime , they'l make more money on average than football players ."
682,"t4rue , and 3e need al the engineers we can get ."
683,whereas there are many men who will paly football . it's itneresting how teh nfl is divided into the nfc and afc
684,"i think historically there sere a couple of leagues brought together in the 60s , when top bowlers made twice as much aa top football stars"
685,that's definitely changed with hoe televised football has become . espn knew what they were doing by creatng the superimposed lien for the first down
686,that line seems sp basic ! how did they win an award for it ?
687,i guess no one had thought of how important it would be fcor those viewing on television . it's funny how simple things can make a big difference . i wonder what rb benjarvus greenellis' secret was to never having a umble inh is career
688,he had s;ecial gloves ? i dunno . a great feat . i hope he got a bonhs .
689,still not as unbelievablea s the georgia tech game against cumbrland . 2220 is a tougbh break for the loser
690,"i hope thatg t puyt in their third string . that's a hlorrible score . what was the spread , i wonder ."
691,who kno2s . i wonder how many of those players went on to play in the ntfl
692,"i don't think the nfl existed at the time . colege ball was the big thing . anyways , breat chat !"
693,it's very possible !
694,do you liked to watch football ?
695,love football . . i like the titans .
696,i don't really like footbal l. maygbe it's because each hfl game only has 11 minute sld live gameplay
697,there is a lot of action in those 11 minutes .
698,"even so , i get vred in between . it's interesting how much nfl has gained in popularity . the top bowlers made twiceas much as top footbqall stars in the 60s ."
699,"i think engineers make ,ore than football players ."
700,"yes , over a lifetime it seems they maoe more . but i don't think that accounts for sponsorships some nfl players get"
701,some are smrt business men . . how many teams are in the nfl ?
702,as far as i know tuere are 32t eams .
703,super bowl is coming soon ! ! first sunday in february .
704,i might get together with soje friends for that . wh are y0u rooting for ?
705,"i wish the titansw ere going but they arent' so we shall see ! ! i'm excited for lamar jack,son 7youmgest rookie to make it to the playoffs ."
706,it's itneresting how much techjology there is in football these days to make sure things are accurate
707,espn won a nemmy fo using the yellow line .
708,and now there are trackin gships in hsoulder pads anbd footballs to track various things
709,that's amazing . eo you ahve a favorite team ?
710,i do not . perhapsa i woulr say the 49ers imply because i'm from ther .
711,the 49ers had a fe3 good games this year .
712,i haven't really been followjng .
713,you like watching the halftime shows ?
714,"i think they are exciting , yes ."
715,did you know the nfl has no written rule against fmeal plawyerx ?
716,i did ! i wish more women met the eligibility requiremnts so we could see then in action .
717,"well , there won't be much action . an nfl game actually only has 11 minutes of live gameplay !"
718,the real game play to watch is from the chips in thekir shoulder pads showing their moves .
719,"yeah , apparently they put chips in their shoulder pads !"
720,do you like asketball ? i like the smaller team of 5 as opposed to the larger football teams .
721,i watch it sometimes . they banned the dunk for awhile because kareem .
722,what did kareem do ? did he play for kansas where jqmes naismith was a losing coach ?
723,h3 was just a really good player that could slam dunk .
724,he shkulx have gone into coacyhing . some of tbe highest state paid employees are coaches .
725,i believe it . did you know espn won an emmy for t6he firsg down marker ?
726,i dif not ! pretty cool ! almost as cool as playing basketball att he us dupreme court on the top floor !
727,"ibteresting , they have a court up there ?"
728,they do ! i would love to play and tak ei8nfo over yime by tying the game to get some extra time up there .
729,well in teh 9160s top bowlers made twice s much as footbal lstars .
730,that's amazing since bowling is not fery popular . i love o bowl even though i am not very good .
731,"i bowl in a league ,b ut i don't mkae any where near a football star ."
732,dk you know the dimensions of a bowling bqll ? i believe they are bigger than a basketball at 9 . 4 inxhes in diameter .
733,id on't know . but i think some areb igger than other4s depending onw ight .
734,"it wou,d be an interesting sight tos ee a bowljng bowl go through a basketbal lhoop of 18 inches ij diameter ."
735,that would be hilarious .
736,hey there you a football fan ? i love the american version but not so much the rugby or australian rulws variation .
737,i love footblal ! did you onow that the nfl huas no written rul eagainst female players ? a woman woud be allowed just as long as she met the requirements .
738,i would l9ve to see that ! she probably wouldn't mind playing at the university of iowa with the pink locker room !
739,"agreed . it'll happen eventually , especially now tha tthere are femlae rtefs . i wodner if they'd be allowed to eat in the samer estaurants . . saibts cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat in a restaurant a player is in and if the playe rcomes in while the cheerleade rs eating , she has to leave ."
740,true . that is an odd rule . not sure if i ageee . the nfl also uses tracking chips in the players shoulder pads to traxck movment .
741,very interesting ! adn an average nfl game has only 11 mins of live gameplay .
742,wow . too much timef or ads lol . negineers even make more lifetime earnings han most nfl players !
743,"i believet hat . are you a fan of baskrtbal ? hte inventor of basketball , james naismith , is the only losin coach in the history of the4 university of kansas . pretty ironic ."
744,yes i love bball ! very ironic . i wonder who th best coach in kansas history is . the new zealand basketball team is icknamed the all blacks !
745,a little inappropriate but i fit doesn't bother them then ok ! haha did you know the the us supreme court building has a bball court on the top floor and it's called ' the highest court in the land ? '
746,"i would love to play ont he highest court in the land . college coaches get paid so much , they are the highest paid state employees in 39 out of 50 tates ."
747,"met oo . that's pretty wild , iw ould have thought it would be football coaches or players woudl eb top paid . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top foobtal lplayers !"
748,"me too . that ios a funny sfat , neve4 would have expected that . i love watching football on tv . i rememer watching greenellis because he never fumlbexd the ball ."
749,oh yeah the poaye ron the pats . taht's awesome . i l;ove watching football too . i'm already looking forward to next season . the highet score ever in a football game wa s2220 . i'd call that a shut out .
750,"yeah no doubt . that hapoened bac, in 1916 i don't think that wold ever happen currently ."
751,"definitely not in the nfl witj only 11 minutes of game play . also , i didn't know this until recently , but the nfl also uses chips inside the footballs to track the velocity , speed , and location ."
752,that explains how they get such accurate stats and stuff . they also put the chips in the shoulder pads to track player movement .
753,"well with it being thd highest professional .evel 0of maerican football , i know the nlf definitely invests 9n the best technology ."
754,yes you said it right . with only 71 regulars eason games they have go pack j tall in ! well i really enjoyed conversing wit hyou !
755,"yes , definitely a good conversation ! have a great day or night !"
756,unforunately no football to watch this weekend because the supebrowl already happened ! bye now !
757,"hi , do you like football ? by football i mean nfl football ."
758,"i love watching both nfl wand college , how about yhou ?"
759,i mostly just watch nfl but i do atch some college too . now is the hardest time of the year . super bowl over . it's a long 3ays unti lseptember . .
760,"right , at least they have that new league , but i don' twarch i t. do you have favorite teams ;"
761,me either . i dont' really have a eam i'm a die jard fan of dince there is no nfl t4eam where i live . did you know the nfl puts chips inside the footballs to measure velocity and rotation ?
762,"there is no nfl team where i live either , i like the iowa hawkeyes though for college . i never knew about the chips that is interesting ."
763,"they are even iside players shoulder pads too ! i think that ois to measure how ahrd of a hit they are tkaing , or giving ."
764,"wow , i wonder if they arec reated by the enfineers who make more money n tgeir lifetime than nfl plaefrs"
765,probably ! the time it would take to design tha t. also makig them small enoughs o they are noticed by the players . i think the average nfl salary is low because hteir xareers are so short and unlike otger sports they all bave non guaranteed contracts .
766,"for sure , you only hear of the star players making hte big bucks . have you ever heard the worst score in college football ever ?"
767,"i did , but i don'tr ecall . i rremember it happened a long time ago an was super smbrrassing . i take it you know ?"
768,"it was 2220 in 1916 ,g eorgi atech vs cumberland . i would have quit after that game lol"
769,wow ! i was thinking maybe 100 point spread ?. they could hav eat least shown mercy . i guess back then teams were a lot more ruthless . too ba despn wasn't around then i'd love to watcn the highlight sand se the faces of the cumberland playerz l
770,right or just left hte field to never play again lol . i would hope a mercy rule was createda fter thwt gmae
771,or at least some kind o gentelman's agreement where you stop rying to score more points which is proabbly what would happen now . it was a different tim3e abck then .
772,"ror sure , a lot differnet back then . nowadays they uave pink locker rooms for colledge ol"
773,"i saw that , although i don't think that would really bother the visiing tesa mmuch . they arse so focused on the game ."
774,actually the pink messes with them . pink is a calming color and relaxes them extra
775,i guess that makes sense . did you know espn creatwd the supdrimpoksed yellow line for 1st owns before any oth3r broadcast network ? they won an emmy for it !
776,wow ! i never knew that ! i used to think i twas rea lgrowing up lol . it was so nicerc hqtting wjth you !
777,have a great night !
778,thanks you as well !
779,i read a lot of sports illustrated . im a big fan of the nfl
780,"interesting . i'm a space junkie , and i'm jel of te internet speed that the international spqce station has ."
781,i heard its faster than ours here in the us . is that true ?
782,"it sure is . it's weird that there are more automated software programs on the internet , thamn hukans ."
783,maybe its trying to stop people from clicking links on the internet . it can be an addiction
784,"maybe , as egosurfing is very rea . i've never looked myself up , though ."
785,do you you read the full terms when buying a product online ? only 7 percent of people do
786,i do not . are you a snoo0 dogg fan ? he wrote a song for his son's football team . how cool is that ?
787,that is pretty cool . i wonder if the song is longer thanj that hte length of live game play in the nfl whic hs only 11 mins
788,i don't know . it's amqaxing that colege foo6tball teamx have 14 of the ;argest stadiums in th world . i would have thought those would belong to nfl teams .
789,they even have a pink visitors locker 4oom locagted at iowa !
790,"that's funny . surprisimgly , the coahes of the military football teazms , are the highest ;aid rmployees at the department of defense . seems a little silly that they are worth more than the people who puyt their lives on the linr to keep us safe ."
791,n many states coaches are also the highest paid person
792,"that's isane . so is the stadium in tx that cost 60 ,illion . . . for a highsvhool team ."
793,was that all paid my tades ? you have to wonder
794,"who knows . it' a little disgus6ing to thin kthat they spned so much money on a tracking chip that monitpors players every move , ah dal lthe stats of a football , yet ,. . . we don't have those capabilities on cars ."
795,maybe its because the average liferime earnings of an engineer are higher than that of a player . got to learn how to keep them healthy
796,"tehre is a rocket scientist who coaches in the nfl . matt patricia , ever heard of him ?"
797,i ahve ! he coache sthe lions . thats a crazy career path for a person
798,"his school's fight song has six digits of pi in it m, that woul dbe a fun school to attend ."
799,thats funny
800,"thajnk you for chatting with je , have a wonderful day ."
801,you as well thanks
802,good morning .
803,good morning . do you follow football ?
804,"off and on . i do wa5ch it occasionallyg , both college and the nfl ."
805,"i first ldarned football in hig school juat sittinhg in the stands . i wasn't there , originlly , for it , but i got6 to learn the rules and such . it sure helped me coun tor math by 7s !"
806,"that is an interesting skill to pick up by watching football . for how long of a game it is , it iss urprising that htey aqverage game only has q1 minutes of live play tiem ."
807,"i wonder how that compares to baseball , wqhich is often regarde das a boring , noaction sport . soccer and hockey ahv econtinuous ation , by comparison . i'll be the highestscoring game ever , a 2220 rout , had more than 11 minutes . it would certainly take me more than 11 minutes to run 222 football fieolds ."
808,that is ah uge score for 1 footballg ame . i woudl have likes to see that . too bad that was in 1916
809,"i think it would have gotten boring after they reached 60 points , then exciting aga8n after 100 , when fhe novdlfy o fit is just ' how high can they go ' and ' will the other team score at all ? ' i'n much more interested in the strategy behind the game . only real players cang ive you that imsight , like paul simmerman , who wrote for sports illustrted ."
810,"yeah , i lnow he wash ighly respected nad it was very sac when hse passed away ."
811,"i love hearing those more technical aspects of the game , ' behind the scenes , ' like he was abld to give . have you learned euch tidbits about football or other sports ?"
812,i think he funniest fact i ever heard about football was that the univeresity o fiowa painted the locer room for the visiting team totallh in pink .
813,"pink . . . di you know that 100 years ago , pink was the color for baby boys , not blue ? it's a fact i head on the internet , so it must be tue ."
814,"i had heqard that too . people don't believe me . the internet doesh ad a vast tange of information ,b 7ut itr isn't all accurate , that'z true ."
815,"i'm largelys keptical too . for instance , i can't believe that the curretn library of alexandroia has saved a copy of the ingernet . what does that evenm ean ? explain tha tto me , interet !"
816,how exactly do you save a copy of the internet . that sounds like a bogus claim . did you know people can get an addiction to the internet ?
817,i'm pretty sure i'm addicted to jt . at least some aspects like sociawl media . you ?
818,"i try to limit my time on social merdiaz , but , yeah i spend more time than i should on it . it's just amazing that hte interent connects you to peo;ple worldwide ."
819,"it doez . my grandfather , who immigrated from eastern europe , still cvonnects with other refugees via skype . in his eyes , it has to be true magic ."
820,"that ks amazint . i just learned the other day ,t hat 'internet' comes from the contractio nof interconnected network . i never realized tyat is what the nmae mdant ?"
821,"i nmeverf knew that . i just kne wthat internet is supposed to be capitalize d, in neglish at lewst , oike we give it the respect of a p5oper title ."
822,"really ? id idn't know that . did you read thwt on the internet ? ; ,"
823,"autocorrect , the greatest gift to us from steve josb , always seems to correct mew hen i type it . and yes , internet tells me how t spell its , his ? her ? , name ."
824,"autocorrect is pretty greag . well , i am off to do some research via the internet . thanks fkr the cuat ."
825,hey did you ever read any articles by paul zimmerman ? he just passed away
826,yes they were great arficles about football .
827,yes i agree . what you lived until 86 s that was a full life i think . i think is moxt famous boo kwas a ' thinkin gman's guide to pro football '
828,"speaking of footbal l, so many countries call other sports football"
829,yes there are a lot of different versions of football . ne of tbem is australian rules football and qnother is rugby footbll
830,they are known as football codes
831,yep that's true . do you evwer watch football on tv ? do you know who invented the yellow lin ethat showz the first down ?
832,i don't know . did you know a h8gh school stadium cost 60 million to build
833,"no i didn't . that'sq uit ean amount ! als quite an amoubt , is tht bowlers in the 60s made 2 times as much as top football sars at the time"
834,"i did hear thay . those huge flags they have at the games cost 50 , 900 and weigh 1 , 100l bs !"
835,"that's very impressive ! i would neve rbuy onde o those personall haha . wha6 do you think about the patriots running back benjarbus greenellis ? he's nevesr fumbled the footnall , he's awesome !"
836,that's awesomd . did you know they put tracing devices in the shouder pads and football
837,no i didn't know that . do they take them off when they're done playing ? that sound slike a breach of privacy tonm e
838,"it's to track the palyers mogesa nd distance of the ootba,l during the gam e."
839,"ok that amkes sense . the6 should track the average nfl game oength , apparently it's only about 11 minutes of live gameplay"
840,that's suc ha short time fo ra game that seems so long . the fist n playoff gzme was playe din 1932
841,that's a long time ago ! i wonder if theyr ecorded the first game ? do you know that females can actually play for the nfl too ? there's no rule against it
842,not sure if they recorded but the field was only 80 yards . do you think a female will ever play ?
843,yes i think that one swill eventually . they will be a kicker o something to start . o'm just shocked that an engineer will make over their lifetimem ore money than an nfl player
844,probabl6 be their careers are long and not as physical . matt patricia is a coach and he's a rocket scientist
845,yeah he seemed really smart . how often do uset he internet by the 3way ? have you ever clicke dthe hamburger button before ?
846,"hello , do you like football ?"
847,id o like football but i like the internet better . do you use thw inernet much ?
848,yes i do . i use it daily .
849,"there are a lot of little known facts about the internet . for instance , did you know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button ?"
850,"yeah i did that is redally interestin g, i wonder why it is called a hangurger .a pparently , constant clicking can causea n addition ."
851,"or , a hamburger looks like that icon , two buns with the habmurger in the middle , get it ? anyway , yes i agree that constant clicking can cause an addiction . i think i've got taht one as well ."
852,"oop s, sorry abou tthe slelling erro r. you have an addiction to clickin g? are there any support groups that help with this addidtion ?"
853,"funny , not that i've heard of but one never knows wagt coulds tarted . amother funn7 fac tis that only 7 percent of people red the full terms when buyint a product or sergice on the int3rnet . i , myself am guilty of htat zonetimes ."
854,i believe that for sure . it fulol terms is som ucg readign and sometimes hard to understand .
855,"true , it ca hget complicated . even tghe internet itself can be hard to udnerstand wijth its vast range of information resources an dservice slike hypertext documnets , www , email , nad file dharing ."
856,yeah . did you now there id 3g celo service at the 5op of mt . everest ?
857,"wow , imagine that ? i couldn't imagine how that happened but i do know that hte curretn library ofa lexandria has a saved copy of the internet in case o fcatastrophe ."
858,"now you can take selfies and post them wehn you get to the top of the mountain lol wow , the internbet is backdd up , thats cokol ."
859,"and also consider how huge the inernet is . since its a network of networks that consists of private , public , academic , business ,a nd government networks of local to a global scope , it's size is immeasuragble to me ."
860,"yeah , the internet is maazing , it's so convenient . i can't imagine doing research the old fashion way . or eve nusing a phonw book ol"
861,"yes , technology has taken over most manual processes for sure . even the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in the player's shou8lder pads to records all od their moves ."
862,"also , in the football !"
863,"yes , they put a chip in the football to rexord and track the velocity , rotation , ball speed , qnd location of the football whicg probabl saves a lot o ftime ."
864,"yeah , look sliek technology has nade a great impac ton football anr other sports ."
865,"yes , i think it will help to give more game play time . an average nfl ame only ahs 11 minutes of l8ive gameplay ."
866,"its been good talkin to you , hav ea good oen ."
867,"hi , do you watch football ?"
868,"i'm not really a fan , but i c9mpete with my brother to pick the most winning teams eahc week ."
869,nice . did you knw women ca nplay too ?
870,"we actually uad a girl on the football team where i went to high shcool ,t hojgh i hav enever seen a girl play football professionally ."
871,"me either , would like to see them though playing there"
872,"i', sure popular football writer paul zimmerman would be surprised tyo see it happen ."
873,"yeah , too bad he passed away"
874,he hadb een having poor health for a while . it'?s good to know ye isn't suffering naymore .
875,yes that is true . did you know there is only 11 minutes ofg amepaly in a game
876,there are four quarter sof 15 minutes each . how are there only 11 minutes of actula play ?
877,i guess there is a lot ofg etting in position and stufft hat does not count
878,"not like the sport called ' football ' in other countries , whaf we call socer , there is always action in tha game !"
879,yeah that is for sure . do you use the intern3t much ?
880,i am actuallya ddicted to the untrernet .
881,yeah me too i think actually you ca ncevelop addiction from clikcing too much
882,email and file sharing are very useful internet zervices that i use daily .
883,those sure are . do you know what hamburger has to sdo with the internet ?
884,"i'm not rezlly sure , though somet9ems ig et hungry hwen using the internet and order dinner to go from an online food delivery service ."
885,yeah thos4 are convneient . i tis the thrdee horizonal line menu
886,i wonder why it is called a hamburger mkenu ?
887,i guess it looks like one . nice chat
888,hello . lets talk abut the nfl . did you know that there is now ritten rule htat women can not play ?
889,"hi , yeah , i had heard that . wonder why lne hasn't tried to play , yet ?"
890,"if they meet the leagues's eligibiliry requirements they could play , i wonder what the requrmeents are ."
891,"probabpy physically tougher than a lot would wntt o attempt . a kicker would make a njce start , though !"
892,"the games seem so long whiel watching , but there is only 11 minutes of live game play on average"
893,i feel your pwin ! the last super bkwl dragged on over thtee hours . too much standing around and other nosnense . it should be streamlijed and made faster .
894,did you know that over a life time an engineer can make more money then an nfl player
895,"wow , that's onterestintg . bu7t , ig uess that's an acerage player , not a tom brady type . do you have a favorite team ?"
896,"patriots are mine , what about you ? engineer scan also maie moret hen an mlb player over a lifetime"
897,"new england patriots are my favorite team , also ! go pats !"
898,there are tracking chips that are lpocated i9n player's houlder spads to track the on the field
899,"i read there are also chips placed in teh bzlls that track garious things , as well . the nfl is getting so hugh tdch , aren't they ?"
900,"yes , lets tal about the nba next . nike used to pay the fine for jordan to wear air jordan's"
901,"i remember when they were banned when they first came out . nike had the money to pay all those fines , it didn't matter they made it all back from the exposure itg ave them . everybody wante da pair of air jordan's !"
902,tim duncan could ahve went straight to the nba butd ecidedft o stay in college isntead .
903,"that was very smar tof him to do . always good to have a fall back career , in case basketball doesnt; work out . the dtatistica are not good for the average player afte rkleaving th egamd . within 5 years , most are bankrupt ."
904,interesting m i dont thihk that will happen to alle4n ivedson since he signed an endorsemenht deal with reebok paying him 32 million zt age 55
905,he amde one good deal ! i would like tp have him negotiate for me ! lol
906,"i agree k it also pays him 800 , 00 a yea rwhich sounds like a real,y good deal to me"
907,"do you have a favorite basketbal, team ?"
908,i dontr eally . you ? reggie miller's siste5 was also veryg 0ood at basektball breaking 8 national records . nice talking to you today
909,it's almost superbowl time ! ! did you know that the highest score in a football game was 2220 in 1916 ? georgia tech did that ! ! ! pretty imp4essive !
910,it is almost super bowl ! ! ! i am so exited . who are you rooting for
911,"i don't really have a preference . . . just looking forward to a good game . . hte nfl uses tracking chips inside the shouldr pads that traqck the llayer's moves . . . rotation , velocity , speed , all that's tracked ! !"
912,i will be using chips supr bowl weekned too ! i'm leaning towards doritos . . . . di you knows teve smith whe nhe playes ?
913,"no . i'm not familiar with him . i recently found out though tnat the nfl as no 2ritten rule against fema.e playerw ! as long as yhey meetr equirements , they can play ! ! that's interesting !"
914,yeah . i am not sure i havw the stomach to watch a woman llayas gainst some 9f those men .
915,"well , one thing for sure is she has to be able to hold her own to get out on the field . players have to be mentally ready for the challenge , whether male k rfemale . . . its pretty demansding . . ?. and could lead to anxiety !"
916,i wonder if she could eat at the same restauarants as the players . the saints cheerleaders cannot . . . .
917,i know ! ! that's an odd rule . veing able to relax nad enjoy good company might be what ix needed to get rid of depression . steve smoth probably cohld have used a little laughter and fun whe nhe was struggling in 2014 .
918,he has been in 2 or 3 known fights with team mates . he brdoke one of their jaws and he was out for like 8 weeks . i wonder if all the head collision has naything to do with it ?
919,could be ! ! he admkts that the demons he fights are inside . . . but he's learning to cope witht hem ahd to understand things and seek help . that's a start !
920,yewh . i worry about te menta lhealth of these football players . a lot o pain nad depression in the who;e lpeague .
921,"yes , i ag5ee . smi9th has some advice to anyone suffering frpom depression . he recommends aksing for help ! he wants to relay the messg ethat they are not alone anrd there's help ."
922,most nfl teams have a psychologist on staff . i hope they reach out to tbem when they need it . ik now a lot of players are retiring early . . .
923,yes they are . . . yheysend powerful messages to fans weveryday with the actions that they cghoose . like tim duncan ot the san antonio spurs . . . he choseg oing to college for four years over going injto the nba nad making loot !
924,yeah . i am glad he didn't get hurt . it's always af ear of mine when people go back toc ollege instead of the league .
925,"asbolutely . . . therr's always the fea f missing an opportunity ! they have to weigh their otions closely when making life changing decis9ons ,j ust ,ike anyonee le ."
926,most athletes are now being tkld to go pro to end their rookie conract a year earlier . it's that second contract thag mkses all the money .
927,"well , sometimes it pays no tto listen so much bu tto take risks an dgo against the grain ! like michael jordan . when he first intrduced jordan's to the nba , they were banned ! imagine that . but mik ekept wearing them anyway , faithfully ,a nd nike had his abck , they agreed to pay all fines ! !"
928,he' the one that put nike 9n the map !
929,"absolutley ! ! ! well , its been nice talking to you ! ! i hope you enjoy the rest of you day ! ! stay warm ! ! goodbye !"
930,you too !
931,"hi , how are y9u this morning ?"
932,"lol . . . . just trying to wake up ! i hope you're well , ho'ws your sports chop sin football and basketball ?"
933,"iu'm good , thanks for asking . i love football more than basketball , but only by a little !"
934,we match perfect then . shame that to mbensen of thes aints passes awaya fter hks team was ripped off this year in the playoffs .
935,"yeah , i wass ad to hear that ."
936,"though in the national football eague my favorite team is the browns . , and it hans't been easy being a fan of tehm in the last 25 years , but this year thwy were a lot better with baker mayfiel dand the gang ."
937,"yes , i aree the browns have had a tough time of it , but things are looking up for them . did you watch the superbowl ?"
938,"no , not this year . it's the first sup4er bowl i've ever missed . i was boycotting the game , because i didn't think teh rams belonged on it . the new rleans saints were a far better team , and thney got ripped off ."
939,"i agree wit hylu on that . i watche djust to see if the goat , tom brady could pull off another one and he did . lol"
940,yep ! i did bet the opatriots to win that adn i won a little coin . thanks football !
941,cool beans ! you know i've played footabll since little league and watched it all my adult life and i was shocked to find out tyhat there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay .
942,"i know , i can't believe that . next year when af ootball game is on , i'm going to have to grab a stopwatch and actually tiem the gameplay . . . . i still can't believe its' only 11 minutes ."
943,do you ever wonder why the nfl doesn't have a female player yet ? i mean there is no4 ule against female players .
944,"i've known a couple female football players in mt life , and they were go0od ; it's just tha tthey both agreed yhat they arne't anywhere as near as strng as males . i think that'st he whole thing . would like to see itt hough ."
945,me too . a nice jiggly one ! not a big bertha !
946,"lol . , . . man , we do think the same . i haven't watched any of the national baskeball association since cleveland lost lebron james , yeta gain , . but , we understand why he left . and go figre , it may be his first time in forever that he may not make the playoffs . good for that silly laker team"
947,that's so true . do you know thatt he granny style of shooting is th eabsolut ebet technique for scoring loints on the line ?
948,"wow . . . never knew that ! hey , nave you watched any og the new alliance of american football yet ? it's not too bad ,a nd i've bet all 8 games this year , and won 6 . they set the over or under way too high foir guys that barely practiced as of yet . i'll bet the betting lines go way down this nextw eek ."
949,"nope , i haven't caught any of those games , yet ."
950,"you'll have to chekc one out .d ecent football . well, , it's been nice chatting with you this early . good luck in pikcing up good payers on mturj today . and have a great day my friend !"
951,"you too , my friend !"
952,to ghe ne3xt survey . . . . lol .
953,o you like the nfl ?
954,i do . did you hearf they are usin gtracking chips on the players now
955,oh cool what for ? did yo know women can play too ?
956,on nice . yes they are tracing velocity and rotatiom and stuff lie that
957,nice . i hope they can use that to make the game safer too .
958,good poibnt . so how come women can play too ?
959,"we;l there is no written rulke aganst hem playing so if they make the cu t, they play"
960,i see . did you know here is a coach who used to be a scient8it ?
961,"i have not heard oft hat one , who is it ? do you know h wlogn the gmaeplay is"
962,"it is matt patrica . i have no idea , is i no tthe enire game ?"
963,nope it is actual.y 11 minutes the average
964,and yet w eare glued to the tv for hour sfor the game to end
965,true . did yoy know engineers make more than rootball players over the licetime ?
966,i guess rthet have longer careers too though to nmaybe more time top make money
967,true . did you know u of iowa painted the vsitor locker room pink ?
968,oh wow no did not know that . did you know more thqn half of the largest football stadiums are in the us ?
969,i guess that maeks sense it is such a popular sport here now
970,true . do you know how much the flags in the stadiums weight ?
971,"i have no idea but i bet you it is a lot , they are huge"
972,"yes , they weight 1100 pounds an cost about 50 000 to make"
973,wow that is amazing . it was nice chatting with you .
974,"are you a nfl fan ? there are currently 32 teams , i'm a huge giants fan"
975,"i am a broncos fan , wnd i love football . thre 32 teams are divide into two conferencesn fc and ac"
976,"yep , it's the highest level of american footbal with 16 regular season gamrs a year"
977,thwy get to rest one wek
978,yep . then fl has nk wditten 5ulwe against female poayers ; wome nwould in fact be allowed if they met the leagues' elogibilitt requiremetns . i wonder if there wil; ever be a feamle plwyer anytime soonj
979,that would be fun . i twould have to be a very stronv one . and i found itv ery hard to believe that in average and nfl game has only 11 minites of actual play
980,"well they do take a lot of time to set ul between plays , kickoffs , timeouts so i can see how there is only 11 minutds of actual action"
981,i enjoy the whole game . there is so much we can know abou the playees because they are using tracking chips that they locate in the playrr's shoulder pads .
982,"yea , and they also put chips in the ball to track velocity , rotation , speed , an location . pretty wild"
983,"that makes it way more interesting , did you know the new orleans saint scheerleaders are forbidden from eating i the same restaurants as the players ! ! kind of crazy"
984,"yea , i read about the cheerleader not being allowed to eat wih the saints players . i think the cheerleaers are suing the team"
985,"the should . if they are already eating there and a player co,esd in , they have to leave . i think this is can not be rel !"
986,if they have to the players and cheerleader separate it shoudl be whoever comes in klast
987,hopefully that will be chanbng ;pretty soon . i found amusing that the university of iowa's locker room for the visiting team is painted completely pink !
988,i found it funnier top bowlers made twice as much as football player in the 1960s
989,"wow how differerent it was ! ! there is a game i would like to watfh and it was played in 1916 ,t he score was 222 to 0"
990,"yea i might have to youtube that georgi atecjcumberland game too , well if it's on film"
991,hopefully it ie . we are getting close to th esuperbowl which is hte second week of february !
992,"yea , that's awesome , hopefullyt hey stick to the superimposed yellow line rhay won espn an emmy and not try any other stuff"
993,the playoffs are actually like another tournament consisfing of six temas of each conference t hat is when it starts to eb way more exciting !
994,"yep , i wonder if bnejarvus g5reenellis is still playing , hre's never fumbled th efootball in his nfl career"
995,"thewre are other types of fotball like the australian , rugby and gaeli c, but nfl is my favorite ! well it was upere nice talking to you !"
996,do yo8 like watching football ?
997,hi . yes i loe watching football . how about yourself ?
998,"sometimes i do bu ti have to be in the mood . it's sad that football players , even though they are successful , they suffer from depression as well l"
999,yes i agree . some players have reporgted feleing free after retiring .
1000,"steve smith is known as a tough wide receiver but throughout his career he felt trapped , inferior and alone ."
1001,yes its amazing the grip depression has over some lives .
1002,his own words were overwhelmed and broken .
1003,sometimes the best thing players wnd others can do is to get help .
1004,"a philadelpha eagles gretb rian dawkins even said he was considering suici9de , but thinking of methods that his family could collect life insurance on . yeah , getting help is a must but sometimes kind of tough ."
1005,i agree . it is tough i have needed to get help myself .
1006,hours upoh hours of counseling is sometimes needed even for nfl players
1007,do you like basketball aqny ?
1008,"yes , i like it better than football . how about you ?"
1009,yes i do too .
1010,do you ever see nba players shoot granny style ? apparetnly that is actually statistically the best technique .
1011,i can not say that i have . that would be very funny though .
1012,"i know , wouldn't it ? dk you like tje shoes air jordans ?"
1013,my boyfriend loves them . he has too many pairs to even count .
1014,htey we4re banned when they first came out by the nba . jordsn wore them anyway knowing he would just pay a fine every game .
1015,its been very nice talking to y9ou .
1016,you too !
1017,"ik now depression affects everyne , but that reqally surprises me that a fop nfl player struggles with it"
1018,"i now , i have heard a lot about head injuries with nfl players so i wonder uf it iw connected"
1019,"5hat could efinitley be a part of it . i' scoo lthawt people are talking abut it , even ;eople like michael phelps"
1020,yeah it's very groudnbreaking for steve smith to speak so openly about his feelings .
1021,"yeah l mental health awarenews is important , and i agree with brandon amrshall ."
1022,what did he say ?
1023,that mental health awareness is ' the civl rights issue of our e4a ' at the end of article sectio9n 3 .
1024,"i don't have that , ca nyou tell mea bout it ?"
1025,it's another wide receiver in the nfl agreeing with other athlete ssho are coming out about mental health issues . he thinks that it is the next social problem we have to sovle
1026,"wow ,t hat's very interezting ! so many athletes seme to be speaking upl ately like michae lphelps , kevin love , demar derozan , brandon amrshall , jist to name a few ."
1027,il ike that steve smith saysz tha thaving depression doesn't mean there's something wrong with him . i think a lot of times peoplwe thonk having a mental health issue mewns you're broken
1028,"i know , excactly , just bein go0pen ike phelps was is great"
1029,what do you think zbout teh nfl in genera l? like professional football in general ?
1030,i think it's pretty tun to wath but like i said the fact that all of these players suffer depression it makes me concerned 5that the players are maybs hurting themseves !
1031,what do you yhink the nfl or nba can doa bout it ?
1032,"i'm not s7re , perhaps they can offee the players a large platform to tell people to seek help ike brandon marshall did"
1033,"yeah , maybe they can offer them counselitn , too , in a more transparnet waay . there's a lot of money in these leagues , i'm sure thsey have enough"
1034,"that's true , hopefully they pay gor the athletes to have jnsurance policies which cover all of these mental heath needs ."
1035,"an dif coaches are talkin gabout this stuff , too , and no tjust players , it coupld go a logn way towzrds changing the culture"
1036,yeah which makee sense since eople in our culture in all industries like mus9c even have been apeaking a lot about mentla health
1037,"nice talking to you , take care"
1038,"y9u too , merry christmas"
1039,merry chrismtas !
1040,"hi , do you watch football ?"
1041,"i don't , but i co attend a super bowl party on te first sunday of february ."
1042,nice . did you know women can play if they want ?
1043,"yeah , if they met the eligibility requirements . i wonder ift hat wil happen ne day ."
1044,"i hpe so , it would be interesting . do you know baout that rule for new orleans hcererleaders ?"
1045,"yeah , that seems pretty sexist .e ven if the cheerleaders were already eating in that restaurant m they have to leqve if the players want to eat there . i mean , i know players are more important to the gam e, but stiol ."
1046,"yeha , it is so sexist , i do not see th epoint of it either"
1047,"i am a woman adn don't know if i'd want to play in the nfl even if i could . i'd father be an egjineer . anyway , over a lifetime , engineers make more than the average nfl player ."
1048,yeah and i am gald htat is the case because engineerds contribute more to the society
1049,"right , though i am sure many engineers do watch nfl games to unwind ! i am not too interested in footbal l, perhaps bcause there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game ."
1050,i knows yet we are glued to the tv for so long to watch the entire thing
1051,yeah . xince espnc reated the superimposed yellow line ith as helped out too . they won an emmy for that
1052,that is crazy to win an award for that . did you know ow they usr cbips on the padding of the players ?
1053,"yeah , and in footballs to9o . the sport of football has sure progressed a lot ."
1054,yeah for sure . do you watch much tv ?
1055,"id on't watch that much . i like to watch comedy , light things . i eard that jim carrey doesn't make dramasd anymore becausd he believes he should only play in movies ghat project poasitivity ."
1056,well if that is what he prefers . did you ever watch house ?
1057,i did ut i got bored of it . apparenlty others did not since hugh laurie is the highest paid actor ever for tv drama .
1058,"yeah he made so much money off it ,7 00 000 p4er episode"
1059,"wpw , that's awesome . i wonderw hat motivated him to become an actor . for michael caine , it was becausea ll the prettiest girls at his scbool were ind rama class ."
1060,"hahah what a reason , good for him . nice chatting with you"
1061,"ehy there , do you like nfl ?"
1062,sure ! have you been following the leveon bell saga with the steelers ?
1063,not so much really . did you know women can play too i frhey make the cut ?
1064,"yeah , whilt h enfl has written rules against having female 0layers , what woman i nher right mind would choose to do that ?"
1065,"it is a violent s;ort for sure . but the game only lasts for 11 minutes , play time"
1066,"yeah , but they train for years to play for just a few seconds a game . i could see a femal epunter doing well , but they only play for seconds per game . and the av glifetime earnigns of an nfl player is less than tha tof an engineer .w omen are too practical to make throw away r3al money on a few seconds worth of playtime ."
1067,new orleans cheerleaders n the othrr hand are mot allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the palyers . i wonder why that rule is .
1068,another reason why women won't play for the saints . . she would be prohibited rom socializing with her cheerleader friends !
1069,strange rules sometimes . it is cool that now the players carry chips on their padding .
1070,"that is the final straw ! tlel a woman you if she plays football , you willm onitor what she eats , track he every movement , preven ther fro msocializing , and then televise statistics on he age , weight , and historical choices ? not gonna happen !"
1071,"i think they use the chips for good things though , like yits and suhc to prevent concussion sand stuvf"
1072,"hey , teh reason thatt he univ of iowa painted the visitor locemr room pink is to help encourage recruitment of female players ?"
1073,"i have no idea , do you know what the highest core in a football game was ?"
1074,"well , there was a game in collete ball where the scre was run up to 2220 . georgia tech trounced cumebrland . but taht was years ago . could be another game too . it would have been had to keep track of yardage in that game ?"
1075,that is very true . did you know espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line ?
1076,"nice feature ! finally an emmy decision i can agree with . did 7ou know thwt in greemellis'sc areer with the patriots , he never fumbled the ball .n either did i , but my nfl career was restricted tk a recliner . still , a grwat accomplishment xonsider9ng that i had a beer in one hand and chips in the ogther . . ."
1077,hahaha that is funny . do you watch much tv other than foiotball
1078,"sure . i watch a lot of rerums of classic progrmas ljke house , starring hugh lauri e. he made 700k per episode for that series , so it's gotta be good , right ?"
1079,yeah that show really rockwd so i am not surprised he made that much money .
1080,"laurie is a great acto5 . unlike the calssic overactor , jim carrey , ho gave up drama befause of ' pwrsonal beliefs ' . . . i think when he played the role as ansy kaufman it messedw ith hisb rain"
1081,seems like it . he bhas really changed . it was nice chatt9ng with you .
1082,"how;s it going , do you follow football ? the redskins have a challenge ahead o them whent hey play the giants offense"
1083,"i don't watch football mucdh , but it does ibterest me some . who do you think will 3in that football game ?"
1084,"probably the redskins , they have a great deense an dthe giant qb has been playing badly"
1085,"don't barkely and becohm jr . play for the giants , 5hough ? or am i thinijg of the wrong nfl team ? they're in the news for being really gooe lately ."
1086,yea bekham and bvarkley play for the giants but they were still 16 .
1087,"i see . which nfl team do you think has the best cheerleaders ? i think they're pretty talente , too . and they have danger like the football players , too ."
1088,"no idea , i feel bad for the saints' cheerlearer though , they can't be in the same place as the fkotball player"
1089,i don't like how some nfl team shav estrange fules like if the cheerleaders are at a restaurant and the football p;layers show up the cheerleaders are expecte dto leave . very strange .
1090,yea those rules omn cheerleaders and players are outdated and sexist
1091,lol thoser were hte same rules you mean t? it is very odd . i think it might have star6ed because it wohld be too distrqcting for the cheerleaders and football players to have relationships togethe r?
1092,i don't thin tha'ts an issue on the professional level .
1093,true . i think there's actually a music video mace based off of tha5 with football players and cheerleaders like that . i think it's interesting no females have played for the nfl .
1094,maybe there wil lbe a femal eplace kicler soon since there are no rules fobridding women from playing
1095,that sounds like i twould be reasonable . i thonk the average football gamw only has just over ten minutes of play . ghink of how much time that leaves for comkercials !
1096,i guess that's a big reason benjwrvus greenellis has never fumble tjhe ball if he only actually plays less than 10 min sa game
1097,did you know that despite howm uch nfl players make that engineers make more in a lifetime ?
1098,tuat's pretty crazy m plus engineers make more than mlb players too
1099,i lik enow the nfl uses chips to track players and the baol . i wish i was the oen who invented that or even the one to have the job analyzing the tracking of them . seem interesting .
1100,"yea , maybe one day they eill combihed the chips with the superimposed first down line espn made for some crazy tv fviewing"
1101,that would be intetesting almlost as interestign as how there's a university where they have the opposingfoo0tball team's locker room painted pink . i'm gonna go watch some netflix now . ttyl
1102,have a good ione
1103,hi ! are you a fan of the nfl ? it hink it's hard to believe the average game is only 11m inutes long in term sof live gameplay !
1104,"yeah . . . i lie alex smith . he's gotten a raw deal in past , like with sf"
1105,"true , but he se3ms to like what he sees with the redskins as they're not like washington teams of the past ! plus they don't like using te word drama too much !"
1106,"yeah , no hype . can't hurt to have adria npeterson involved too"
1107,"agreed . so speaking of the nfl , do you think we'll ever see a female player drafted or signe d? theg cna actually playa s long as thry meet the eligibility requirements !"
1108,i dunno . . . but i think that woulx mke for quite a drama . patick stewert would probably lecture about it
1109,ha ! maybe so ! but i don't thijk anything could be more dramatic i nfootabll than if a sqaints cheerleader is caught dining in the same restaurant as a saintsf ootball player . i can't believe tehre haven't been any lkawsuits filed ver that misogynstic rule .
1110,at this rate they'll pobably insert tracking chips on their cheerleaders .
1111,"yeah , that would be c4azy igf they did ! those engineers are geniuses . with technology like that , no woncer they male more than thea veragel ifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players !"
1112,"yeah , youd on't need to be a rocket scientist to play fiotball . however , it might help . lets see how thing swork out for matt patrricia ."
1113,no kidding ! it takes more physical talent it seems . like benjarvus greensllis who's never fumbd the football ih hiser ntire pro caree r. now that really takes talent !
1114,"that's why they make the bifg bucks . the highest paid people in the military are footba,l coaches"
1115,"are thsy really ? that i salmost unbelievable ! but i used to think a yellow first down line was unbelievable as wekl until espn pulled it off and even won an emy for it , which they rightfully deserved !"
1116,what unbelievable is that the qb with the mos twinw in cleveland doesn't play fior theb rowns .
1117,"that is unbelievalbe and kind o ffunny ! ha ! on another humorous note , did you know the university of iow'as isiting football team's locker room is actually pibk ? thatg would drive me crazy if i was a visiying football player ! ha !"
1118,well lokcer rooms are soap operas . they even have soap int jem l
1119,"ha ! so true ! andx there's a lot of drama like soap operas a well . spekaing of drama , can you believem ichael caine onlyb ecame an actor because he said all the pretiest girls at his school were drama students ? i should have taken drama then . ha !"
1120,well je hamm taught drama in higth school . ellie kemper w2as his student .
1121,"it's a small world , ins't it ? i can't believe hugh laurie of al lpeople is the highet opaid actor or tv dramas . he made 700k esch house episode . that is insane !"
1122,a few more of those an dhe could afford a texas hjgh school stadium . . . which cost 60m to build
1123,"holy cow ! i couldn't imagine a high school stadium costing that much to build ! well , i'm off to to visit this website that ha thousands of classic radio dramas available to listen to for noc harge . it was great chatting with you today ! have a greate vening !"
1124,take care .
1125,football apparently comes in different forms and naes around the world . what do you hrink of aemrifan football ?
1126,"i like it , im watching the superboqwl for sure this year , what do you tink abou tyhe redskins this season ,"
1127,"they were okay . i twas a shame tat alex smith , the quarterback , got hurt ."
1128,"yeah i thought they were going to do better , 9t seems the team has a lot of determination , nad it is a shame ."
1129,ythey havce some good plyers and dro things quietly i9n a way . adrian peterson worker out for them and hardly anything was sad .
1130,"they used toi have flashy names now the team is dercent , fears can lways slow you dob specially with all the taoent out there ."
1131,"true . alex smith is known , he's been around 13 years , but he's not flashy if you know what i mean ."
1132,"yeah i get you , sports what team are you a fan of ?"
1133,"well for the superbowl i can't rea.ly decide . ik'd like to see teh rams win but then again , it'd be great to see drew brees win . what abut you ?"
1134,"i am z patriots fan , i real;ly like them i became a fan o fthe sjnce benjarvus grwenellis , so ia m rooting or them in this superbowl ."
1135,my bad a bita go . i was still thinking of the nfc championshyip gaem . i a mpulling for the rams fo win . did you know that greenellis has never fumbled in his entire caree r?
1136,i didnt know that l he is one of my favorite playes but didnt mknow that about him ad hwat are your thoughts azbout the nfc championship game ?
1137,"considering ther ams playef himself admitted that it should have been a penalty i think they sjou,ld replay the game . i'd like to see what would happen . i also thiunk thdey should pla jit out unil a winner . let it g9 like back in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 ."
1138,"2200 that is close score lol , i bet the other team retired from football vorever ."
1139,that would be pretty bad . so what do you think about the nfc championship game ?
1140,"i thought the sain5s were goimg to win , i was kind of ooting for them ."
1141,i had rhought they would win for a while too . it was a bit of a surprise . i also thought kansas ciry was going to beat tnhe patriots . did you know the saints hceerleadeds are not azllowed to eat in the same testaurant as the players ?
1142,"i dindt know that ,t hat rule should be abolished , its unfair cheerleaders have to leave if a player arrives ."
1143,it 9s unfair . the nfl as jo rule against women players though so that's fair .
1144,yeah i guess so although i don't see a p4o team lining up a woman
1145,i agree . a woman would have to meet eligibility requirementd first .
1146,"hi , aee you familiar with the nfl ?"
1147,"oh yeah , i'm a chiefs fan ."
1148,"appawrently , the nfl has no written rule against female players . it surprised me when i heard about it ."
1149,"yea , let em play as long as men can play women's s0ports too . i heard the averagen fl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . they won't get hurt , right ?"
1150,i was surprised to hear about i t. waht do players do then since 11 minutes is very short ?
1151,"wait . . . i played in hs an dthey were always moving chains , officiating , timeouts , etc . now they are going to put chips in things like shoulder pads to get even more information ."
1152,technologt is available for teams to be more efficient . coaches are xmsart to take advantage of the available technlogy .
1153,"yeah , but iw onder if thr u . of iowa is skart in paingting the visitor's locker room pink ? it may just make them mpore motivated . . ."
1154,i would be more motivaged if i were a msmber of the visiting teams .
1155,"yeah . as a dude , i don't hate the color pink . i love espn's ylelow 1st down line . 5he best emmy ever awarded !"
1156,i agree with you . i cannot imagin an ncl game without the superimposed yellowl ine .
1157,"it makes the game more excitign to me . . . wow , rormer pat' rb greenellis never fumbled inh is entire nfl career ."
1158,"it must be very stressful to hbave thatk ind of record . as some pepple say , tuere is alwys the first time ."
1159,"yeah , as a rb , that's a tall order . my alma mater once beat cumberladn 2220 . i'm not sure i lie that . . ."
1160,that was akmazing . i wonder if cumberladn pla6ers were sleep wlaking .
1161,i wonder if they ever played agai . i can't remember playing thekm when i was there . do you like mjchael caine . i g8ess he got his sart in acting by tkaing a drama class becauxe it had cute girls ih it .
1162,that was funny because he is a brilliant actor .
1163,"yes ,h e's cool . so do you fo;llow the redskins ? i guess they have ag ood defense but they have their challneges too ."
1164,"no , i do not follow hte redskins . i aould watch any nfl team if they were in the superbowl ."
1165,"same here . qll nflt eams are good . funny , even they were swseating playint the 16 giants . i guess even being good against the rum amy not help against certain teams ."
1166,"i agree with you , all nfl teams are good . anyway , i need to go tk bed . it was nice chatting ith you . good night ."
1167,what was the issue with le'veonb ell ?
1168,i am not sure about thaf . i think he wanted more money . it was definitely ac ontraft dispute .
1169,which nfl team did he play for ?
1170,"oh , he played for the pittsburgh steelers . he was their running back . iv he didn't sign a contract and jojn any team he wouldn't be able to play for the season ."
1171,oh . i also heard they had someone replacing him at his position . who was that ?
1172,i th9ink it ws james conner . he'e only been around fort wo years whereas bell hasx b4een around for a while and even been to the probowl twice .
1173,"well , age is alwaysa n issue . any reason they did not trade bellk ?"
1174,"most likely duet o his record . he is a good running back adn they need one . however , with connor stepping up his game it seesm bell might not be so needed anymoe ."
1175,"who would make that decision . the head coach , right ? wnat is his name ?"
1176,mike tomlin is the head coach and h ewould be the one to maket he decision alog with other s. tomlin's a good coach so he knows talent when e dsees it . word is he's happy with connor's work so far .
1177,i would guess the quqrterback has some role too . that big ben guy . do you know his las tname ?
1178,"i do , but not sure on spelling . its rothelsburger . he's a good qarterback that's been around for a while too . i've heard eh lkkes connor as a pass catcher ."
1179,footbal lis a funny game . what about ghat final gamec oming up on the first sunday in february ?
1180,the superbowl is coming up . tgat's the game between the nfc and wfc champions . hte nfc and afc are divisons f the4 national football league .
1181,thanks ! how many teams total are in then ational football league ?
1182,"there are 32 teams imn the lrague , equally divided between both conferences ."
1183,cool . how long is the regular season ? i know it goes all fall .
1184,they play 16 game sand then there are plqyoff games and the superbowl .
1185,i tseems tere is a lot of dead time when i watch on tv . do you know how muc haction there actually is in a gwme ?
1186,"it seems like i heard htere is only about 11 minutes of actual playing time . however , to me it seems like there is more ."
1187,"perhaps , but i guess they know , given all the chips insidef ootbal;ls and hsoulrer pads ."
1188,that's true . football is studiedq uite a bit . i suppose all the different inds of football are studied .
1189,"other than soccer , are there other types of football ?"
1190,"yes there is canadian football and ruby , and australian rules football ."
1191,do youf ollow the redskins or any team in particular ?
1192,i keep an eye out for a few specific teams an dhave mnay friends who are redskins fans . do you have a particuoar favorite te3am or opinion on the redskins ?
1193,"my favorite team is the patriots bur i think the redskins have a nice team , i thinik they have a good qb and could surprise us next season"
1194,there has been recent backlash agains tthe redskins because of their name . how do you think that has affected team morale ? they'vw alsoh ad someq b issues lately . do you think they ave that settled ?
1195,"i gthink they hafe setled the qb issues , i tuink the team ix motivated and will move forward , hopefully htey can add newt alents to theird roster ."
1196,do you think there will be an adjustment season ? the chemistry and dynamc of the team hasc ertainly changed but i so think they have potential .
1197,"ig uess willj ust have to see how things play out , hopefully they can have a good campaign , do you have w favorite team ? mine is the cowboys"
1198,i thought you said you preferred the patriots ?
1199,"i actually like botht eams the same , the cowboys a bit more but in general i just like football , i also like gergia tech"
1200,ah i understand ! i'm sure you know about the crazy georgia tehc 1916 game with the 2220 score ?
1201,"i didnt know about that ! tht is a crazyv ictory , it happened back in 1916 so maybe thats why i dont know about it , do you think the other tea mretired from football ?"
1202,"you know , i don'gt know enough t0 say with confidence . the otehr team was cukberland ? it's not a team that i've heard of . that is ah absurd football score 6hough ."
1203,"i would hwve nightmare saout the players of the other teams lol , another imteresting fact is how espn won an emmy befause of gootball ."
1204,for the creation of rhe lines f0or downs ? i find that very interesting . it's noit your average emmy
1205,"yeah , for the creation of the first down yellow lin and i agree its not common although ig has influence the game for sure ."
1206,do you know what year tghat happen3d ?
1207,im not sure but defunetey a ong time aho .
1208,fair enough . did you know that women aren't technically banned from playing in hten fl ? if a woman met the eligibility requ9rements it would be permissable for her to play !
1209,i didnt know tuhat but who knows if we'll be seeing one playing anytime soon
1210,yes i think you are right . i wonder if there are mlae nfl cheerleaders . saints cheerleaders can't east at the same restaurant as an nfl player . eve if the cheerleader was there frst they are required to leave !
1211,"thag seems really unfair and sexist , that rule makje me3 rewlly angry , the saints should change that ."
1212,do you watch football ?
1213,"yes i do , i am a redskins fan and like the team this year ."
1214,that's cool . the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 ehen georgia tech defeated cumberlamd 2220 !
1215,"that is an epic win ! i wasnt aware of it , what toorball team do you like ?"
1216,i like the eagles ? amazing game last week ! did youk now an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
1217,"i didnt know hat either , interesting stats , it sure seems like a lot longer , do you know other interesting facts ."
1218,it definitely doee ! te nfl has no written rules against women players .
1219,it would be interestign to watch a woman play .
1220,"yeah , that aspect is pro w0oman , but the saints cheerleaders are forbiddenf rom eatgong in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required o leave !"
1221,"thats inte5esting , i also heard taht the iowas university locker room for visiting teams is completely pink ."
1222,thatsr eally funny ! in he 1960's rop bowlers made twice as much as top football stars !
1223,"i know , it must be weird to be in a pink locker room , what do you think about hte nfl chips ."
1224,it's a little creepy but gives somje cool detailed information .
1225,"its itneresting , i wonder how those stats change the game ."
1226,i'm not sure .e spn won an emmy for the creation of tne superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games !
1227,"i didnt know they gave emmys for that , whaf is your favorite nfl team ?"
1228,"yeah , i didn't know that either . kinda neat . i like the eag4ls !"
1229,"teah , that ab itneresting fact for a gathyering , 8 like the patriots and the redskins ."
1230,very clol . espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line fo ramericqj football games .
1231,i wonder if espn won other awards .
1232,former partiots rb benjarvus breenellis ha bever fumbled the football in his nlfc areer ! i learned a lot . thanks for chatting !
1233,are you a fa nof the steelers ?
1234,i love football but am not a steelers fan . are you ?
1235,me either tk be honest m i'm a redskins fan . what;s your tea ?
1236,bears . how did your seson go ?
1237,"ferrible ,l ike usual . ever since dan snyder bought htem , they stink . how about teh bears ?"
1238,"we made the playoffs but los tin the first round thanks to cordy parkey's doubl edoink . . . didn't you lose your qh near the midedle of the season ? kirk cousins , right ?"
1239,"we edid , i hink he is good , but not worth th4e money . they made a huge mistake with rg3 a few years ago ."
1240,mistake ? in letting him go ? drafting him ? shannahan yetting hm killed ?
1241,"in drafting rg3 . he's a great athlete , but he sn't nfl material . he is just way to small and prone to uinju4ies . wich is what happened to him ."
1242,"6he shannahanhs goth im killed . i rem3mber seeing nota , big ole dlinman from the ravens , land on him adn worried about his health ."
1243,"yeah , i think he 4nd4ed up going to the ravens . likse i ssid he was really small entering the nfl and he tol dpeople here in dc he was gonna bulk up before his 1t seawon , but hen ever did ."
1244,he had that track speed which was appeawling . do you remember whe npeople that he would be beter than luck an dthought he should have gone number one overall ?
1245,"yeah , i remember tat . the good qbs always tend to have similar traits . 6hey can take relaly hard hots , stand i nthe pocket , adn are around a really long time ."
1246,yeah and i wouldn't want big ben on my tezm . would you ?
1247,"i'm not sure . he's pretty good , but he's had some bad off field antics ."
1248,i would hatw for him to call o8ut me on the radio like he has a few of his receivers . seems like he tries to be a leader without lead3rship qualitires .
1249,"oh , does he do that ? i didn't know that . hialrious !"
1250,yeah . did you read about leveopn bell holding out ?
1251,"oh yea , i did . was that why ? that's absud ."
1252,hew anted more than 15m to play running back . 15m just doesn't go9 as far as it used to
1253,"yeah , mant hat is a lot of money though . i would tota.ly take it . well , hnice chatting woth you ."
1254,saquon barkley and odell beckham jr . make a dynamic duo for the ny giants .
1255,"they sure co , and odell has that crazy beef with kosh norman as qell !"
1256,beckham jr . has always done well against washington db's ?. averages 8 catches and over 100 yards per gain against them .
1257,tha tis pretty impressives ince the average nfl game only has 1 1minutes of game !
1258,and barkly hasa so many long runs . it's maazing waht can happen i nthose eleven minutes .
1259,"barkley had 7 20 yard rushes not even hafl way through the season , he is an animal !"
1260,"washington should dow ell against him . they have stopped dacid johnson , alvin kamara , christian cmcaffery and ezkeiel leliott pretty well ."
1261,"that is impressive , yhose are some of the nfl's bes t"
1262,washington will also have to deal with barkley'?s receiving skills . he is good out of the backfield .
1263,"he sure is , and then pair that with ebckham and it can be hard to stop !"
1264,the key tos topping the giats will be to preesure eli manning .
1265,aybe if they do that they ca nwin 2220 lioe georgia tech !
1266,"mayb e. . . thnat's strethcing htings . tyen again , the redskins have alex smith and adrian peterson ."
1267,"that they do , and tbey are a great tandme , ho0efully they stay healthy !"
1268,"healthy is the key . nfl careers are notoriously short , partly due to injury . the average nfl player earns less in theirl ifetime than an engineer ."
1269,"i have h4ard that , and engineer scertainlyh ave a safer job !"
1270,even worse are fraternzing rules . new orleans saints cheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant as an nfl player . really !
1271,"i have heard that as well , i wonder what the ra6ionael is there ?"
1272,who knows ? yet the nfl has no rules qagainst femalse players .
1273,"that is true , i wonder what girl has come the closest toi playing ! maybe as a kicker ?"
1274,who knows ! the univrsity of iowa' sviksitor locker room is painted pijnk .
1275,hello .
1276,"hi , do you lik efootball ?"
1277,i8 love it . im a steeler fan . how about you .
1278,"i am red skins fan , like the guy who won the contest at at bucs game ."
1279,oh . well im sorry to hear that lol .
1280,"i like what he did , i was forc eto wear a bucs shirts , b7t underneath there was a redskins shirt with the number 47 ."
1281,hats funny . did you know the iowa university locker room for visiting team is painted pink .
1282,"no , i did not know that , why did they do this ?"
1283,i would say to pysc the other team out . do you think it worked .
1284,"i don't know , pink , beside beihg feminine , is quite a neutral colof . i would have chosen to decorate the locker with clowns if it ws me ."
1285,or like a bloody nithtmare on the walls . something crazy like that would b4a wesome .
1286,i think i would be lamost cheating . do you like watching football on tv ?
1287,no it would be funny . cheating happens on the fiel d. lol .
1288,do you think that georgia tehc cheated when they won 222 00 against cmberland ?
1289,i tninkt hat is just crazy . how coud that venh appen .
1290,"maybe it was their firt game . or they did not have even a team , so cobbled soemthing with a groul of somewhat fit students ."
1291,i dont follow what your saying .
1292,"forget , it is too complicated , how would you feel if you won 22200 ?"
1293,"i would feel like a real jerk for running the score up so high , but i suppose i would feel accomplished about my ability to do it ."
1294,"me too , i would feel a little proud , bu tif i injured myself during the game i would feel really bad , 8t wad not worth it ."
1295,i would say id you are able to beat a team by tant much . they are no match physicaly . it would probably be them who needs to be wortied about injuri4s .
1296,"but peopel hurt themselves without the aid of the others team . do you like the other kinxd of football , like s0ccer ?"
1297,not really . i think people hurtt hemselvesb ecause they are giging extra effort because the other team is good .
1298,there could be some rivalries between the players of the same tam . but usually it happens in teams that are already strugvling .
1299,hav ea good day . gta run .
1300,do you like football ?
1301,"i like to go gto the games , yes . i've been reading a lot about th eredskins ."
1302,oh yeah ? i wish they?d do away with that name already .
1303,why's that ?
1304,"it's pretty offensive , but i guess i'm not surprised ; there are a lot of offensive things in football . apparently , the saints cheerlead4ers have to get up midmea land leave if a player comes into the sam restaurant ."
1305,"i've heard tha tas well . yes , i agree ther eare many offensive things in football . i've even heard that the university of iowa's locker room for visiting teams is painted completely pnk ."
1306,"if only we could go back to when bo2lers made twice as much as football stars . i'd get into bowling , for sre !"
1307,"i hear htat ! but , nowadays , the biggest money is now u nfootball for sure .d id you hear what the highest score efer was in a football game ?"
1308,i believe 222 ! during a colplege football game .
1309,"ye s, that 's the same thng i heard . not nly was the highest score 222 but the other team only had 0 . that was georgi atech who defeqted cumberland way back in 1916 . what an embarrassment that must have been ."
1310,that is a pretty crasy number . did you know hte former running back of the patriots never fumbled the ball once ?
1311,"yes , that would be benjarvus greenellis . that pretty ubnelievable that he never fumbled the football in his nfl career . not even once ."
1312,i wish americans had rugby football .
1313,"yes , i like rugby football . as far s i know , it's more like soccer but there mjght be different versions of it as well ."
1314,"i believe it's like soccer , but you can hold the ball . football , after all , is just a sport tgat 9involves kicking a ball to score a goal ."
1315,"ys , and scoring is the most important part of the game . did you know that espn won an emmy fo rcreating that superimposed yellow lien on the tv screen to signify firsrt down ? that was pretty cool ."
1316,it definitely makes watchingt he game on tv much easier .
1317,"that's or sure . not to change the subject but let me ask , do you use an iphone ?"
1318,"i do not , but i have a smart phone . crazy how i9nformatioj is just spread with a 2 . 7 ' cable laying across the ocean flolr ."
1319,"that's true . even though neither y0u nor i have an iphone , i heard htat it has more computing power that the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent . now , that's sokething to write home about"
1320,way different than rotary phones . they chose thw area code 21 2in ny because it was hte easiest to dial on rotary phones .
1321,good moning .
1322,good morning ! did you hear about the die hard redskinsf an ryan rotolo who wore a buccaneers shirt during an on field promotion ?
1323,thats nuts . i am a steelers fa n. i would never do something like that .
1324,i'm a steelers fan too ! awesome ! nothing like steelers fans .
1325,nope . most loyal fans in thse league . as a steelers fan i am getgting sick of the patriots thugh . lol .
1326,yes . i agree . lol do you ever watch pittsburgh dad on youtube ? you'll have to check him out . funny stuff . did you know that former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis enve rfumbled during his career ?
1327,i haven't seen that . i wil lhcec kit oyt though . that is pretty amazing to o your whole career without fumbling .
1328,i agree . the highest score ever i na football was in 1916 georgia tech . beat cumberland 2220 . taht's a crazy stat there .
1329,i just dont see how that coudl happen . everything would have to go perfect .
1330,lol it's like a crazy backyard gaem of football another interesting tidbit is the university of iowa's locker room if painted completely pink for visiting teams .
1331,i wonder if it has any effect on the other team being ready to play or not .
1332,"i tmight . maybe it's for breast cancer awareness ? i think it's funny how they call soccer ootball in other parts of hte wor,d ."
1333,yeah we americans are a little differen tin that regard . they take their soccer seriously in other countries .
1334,yes . i've worked with a few people from egnland nad they were crazy about their socce r. i was just reading something interesting . the president of indoensis realeased 3 pop albums while he was in office .
1335,you would think he would hav emore important things to do huh .
1336,yes . lol . up until 1805 th erunner up in the u . s presidential; election automatically became the vice president .
1337,think about if it was still lke that tody . trump and hillary running this country together . id like to be a lfy on the wall in some of thosem eetings .
1338,lol yes ! i agree . the first president ofz imbabwe was called president banana ! lol
1339,"now introducing , president banna . snickers from the crowd . lol ."
1340,"lol the top 3 wealthiest presidnets in american history were jfk l, washingtn , and jefferson . i thought someone from this era would have made that list ."
1341,me as well . did you know the presidnets guest hluse is actually bigger htan the white house4 .
1342,i never knew that . interdstign ! too bad we cant' have a steeler in politics . i thnk rocky bleire was in politfs for awhile .
1343,i heq5d that . well its been good chatting with you . got to be getting ready for work .
1344,hello ! are you a big fan of footall a tqll ?
1345,yep ! d abears ! how about you ?
1346,da gikes lol . i'm fvrom iowa and am a iowa hawkeye fan as well .
1347,well at leqs5 we are in the same division . did you know that in 6the 60's pro nowlers made more money than top football stars ?
1348,dang i should have been a bowler back in the day ! i would have been somebody ! i wish i could have seen the colldege game that was 2220 !
1349,i think that hap;pened in 1916 . a bit before my tim e. i guess they didn't have mercy rules back then . lol
1350,way before mine too ! i bet the other team wishe dit . i wonder if georgia tech painted their locker room pink like iowa does .
1351,"football incluces wo amny types of games . rugby , soccer , adn gridiron to anme a few ."
1352,and they are all different sports too lol . rootball is even winning emmy's lol .
1353,i was upset that the payriots won again . although they had a rb that never fubled the ball in his career .
1354,"htat is one crazy stat , was it benjarus greenellis ?"
1355,ye0 . whst do you thknk ofr oger goodell ? as prexiden tof thre league i wosh we could vote his butt out !
1356,yes i agree ! he hasn't dons much t0 imprpve the gaem like he said he would ! he is so rich from i ttoo !
1357,"speaking of presidents , how do you like the one we have now ?"
1358,o comment . . . i woudl like to see him release pop albums like the president of indonesia ahs haha .
1359,no comment ? ! lol . its hard to believe taht washington was amohg the richest presidets in american history .
1360,yes i think jfk and jefferson were up there too ?
1361,"honestly , trump would end up swlling more pop alb7ms than most singers today . they would get upset and investigate his street cred . lol"
1362,"hahahat oo funny ! if the first president of zimbabwe was called banana , wa sthe second called orange ?"
1363,"nice ! ! zimbabwe , thats in afrrica . that's wher our last president camje from . you know , mr . obama . he was from kenya ."
1364,yes that is intsresting ! i'm going to look up mor ecrazy facts ! have a great day !
1365,i wonder hwat interest unicef hae in reducing cell phone usage .
1366,8 heard they are donating a day of clean water for children inn eed fore very minute you don't use your cell phone .
1367,"yeah , i kno w. that's why i wonde4e dwhat their interst was in reducing cell phone usage ."
1368,"that i'm not sure , seems like othr things could be given up that would help ease waste prdoduced ."
1369,"yeah , and it's an agsncy concerned with children , so that's weird . i don't have a cell phone anyay , so i guess it's a moot point ."
1370,"speakin gof phones , do you know why new york's areac ode is 212 ?"
1371,"yeah , they gave the lowest numbers to the cities with theh ighest popukations s it would take less ytime to dial them on rotary phones . i guess ny wa sthe biggest city at the time ."
1372,"goodc aoll , did you ever use one of those rotary phones ?"
1373,"yeah , i'm that age lol . i grew up with a rotary phobne in my hous e. how about you ?"
1374,"yeah same here , we didn't have one very long , but in my friend's basement we still had to use it vor years , one buddy was always confused ."
1375,unfortunately with all the automated phone menus thes days it woudpl be hard to ge by with one ny mlre .
1376,"yeah it sure would , not mnay people own lndline phones anymore , i'm assuming you still do correct ?"
1377,"yeah i have t5o i live in a wireless dead zon e, so i also get internet access throuhb a dspc onnection ."
1378,"nice , how aboutt v ,k do you watch much nfl football during the season ?"
1379,i don't havce tv either .n ot much of a sports fan anyhow . do yu ?
1380,"yeah , but i mainly just follow my local favorite team , they didn' tdo very well this season ."
1381,what team'w your favorite ?
1382,"i like the packers , always have and will . i used to .ove watching brett fzvre play . did you know women csn technically poay ?"
1383,"no , i don't know much about their rules , but i guess they just assumed it was something understoor when they wrote the rules and then society changed ?"
1384,i think it would be very cool if a female player made a pro roster and played . it would give hope to young fans out there .
1385,i agree . tha two7ld be awesome . nic ehatting with you !
1386,do you watch much football ?
1387,"hi ! i really nejoy american football tough my peers claim that their vefsion of 'footabll' is much better , otherwise known as soccer . do you ?"
1388,i'll watch it if ig is on but i'm not a huge fan . i confess i don't really udnerstand it .
1389,"so from an 'oitsider' , want to take a guess at why the university of iowa's opposing teams locker room is painted completely pink ?"
1390,i'm guewsing they did ita s an intimidation thing since pink is considered by some to be a girly weak color .
1391,"yeah ! i wonder if it worked and whehter they were able to score anywhere close to what georgia tehc id in 1916 , when they drefeated cumberland by 222 points !"
1392,wow that seems like a complete slaughter . at what pointd o you just sort of give up when the points go that high ?
1393,"yeah , i think my pride wojld be fery defeated and they probably just let them win when they realized a tjrnaroundw asn't like to happen ."
1394,i was surprised to leanr tha t6e nfl has chips in their uniforms and the ball . i waonder what they uset he data for .
1395,my guess is to collect informaion and sell it to teams like what all data is used for but maybe the agents can use it to negotiate bette rcontracts fort heir players .
1396,that makes a lot of sense . i hope they are using some of it to make the sport safer fr the players too . those head injuries are jut terrible .
1397,"i agree , fo0tball is suhc a dangerous sports and concussions definitdy result from gat , since espn won an emmy for the creaion o the superimposed yelow line ih games , i woncer if the researcher who makes breakthrough fidnings will win nobel prize ."
1398,i'd be willing to give hm one . there are so many reports of post concussion mnetal health issues . i cdon't tnhink for th eemphasis that we put on football we are doing neough to make sure 6hat we aren't permanently damaging these young men's brains .
1399,"i agre3e , i actually read a boo, about this which delve into aron hernandez , the patriots player who killed people and then committed suicide and researchers are now studying his brain . pretty great of the family to donate his brain for science !"
1400,thqat ks awesome . i hope tha some of the research done can help thr people that are still dealing with the same issues .
1401,"if uou had kids or have kids , would you let them playu football or other sports ?"
1402,i do have kids and i want them to play sports but i worry about the impacts . i think it will depend a lot on the local leagues and what they are doing to play szfce .
1403,"ik no2 , there are so many advantages of letting kids play sporyts but when i 5ead about stories , i imagine the worst . the nfl doesn't have written rules aga8nst female players from playing , but i think if a female were to play in the game , it woulfd catch everyone's attenjtion and eb heavily publicized in the news ."
1404,i think the emdia would have a frnezy . it would be caleld radical feminism or womdn's empowerment . of course all of us stuck in the middle would be like well let's see if she can whup the patdiots .
1405,"lol , considering there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay , the female w2ould 9nly have to survive those intens e11 ninutes and try not to be tackled by those 300 poundl inebackers !"
1406,that;s true . ia lways thoght that some of the female soccwr players would make excellent kickers .
1407,do you like fo0tball ?
1408,i do like it somewhat . i used to love the tgame but it's so expensive to get tickets now . how about you ? so you enjoy the game ?
1409,"i do enjoy it and yeah tickets are expensives o i usuallgy watch the games at homes with familg and friwends ,d id you watch the superbowl ?"
1410,"yes , i was pulling for the underxog , but the patriots are tough . wh tohter kinds of 'football' sports have you ever seen ?"
1411,"i like to watc hrugby and soccer as well , rugby has a lo9t of differen trules"
1412,i always am amazed that they don't get hurt more in rugby . i don't understahd i tbut it is interesting especilly when they get into those big huddles and push and shove !
1413,did you ever watch fhe playe benjarvus green ellis play ?
1414,"no , who is that ? a football player or a rugby player ?"
1415,"he is a former footrball players , used to play for the patriots was a rb , waell thing is he never fumbled a ball in hi scareer"
1416,taht's quite an accompl9shment . i imagine a lot of quarter backs wiuld love tbat stat ! i think it's so funny that the university of iowa painted their visiting team all pink . pretty obvious psychological tactic !
1417,"that sounds like a really funny tactic lol , i guess t5he other teams are taken suprise by this , at least 5eams that don tknow the locker rooms"
1418,"right ! but why are we s cauhgt up in a silly gender specific color ! since its' not against the rules , i assume some day there will be female playersw ans then there mayb e lots of feminine things jin a locker room ! ha ."
1419,"i guess ao , yeah , espn made a gr4at contribution to he game with the yellow first down line ,"
1420,"wow , yes ! you forget how many innovations tv has brought to watching the ame . its funny that they won an emmy for it . i only think of memys as acting awards ."
1421,"yeah me too but i guess the yellow first down line deservest he price , crazy how bowlers made more money and foobalpl players back in the 60s"
1422,that i sfunny . i bet that same thing isn't true today . nfl players mkae so much . can't kmagine that its even flose to bowler's winnings now .t v haz made a bg difference in the game . crazy that they actually only play for 11 minutes each game !
1423,"i aree tech has changed the gmae in some cases for worse u taslo for theb etter , did you know the players have chips mbedded in their shoulders ?"
1424,i guess that' how they get all ghose stats . i qonder irt hey wsill ecver use those chips to determine whether a player steps o8t o bounds or actually crosses the goa lline ?
1425,"i bet th4y will in a future , the footblal also has tracking chips , all kinds of cool stats are taken out of them"
1426,"so coaches who contest rulings , may be able to use those chips to get the calls reversed to their side ?"
1427,"that would be a good application for them , but maybe football should stay as is , tchc an take tne fu nout of it sometimes"
1428,hi ! are you a football fan ?
1429,"hi , how are you ? sure !"
1430,"i tend to warc hmore collee ball myself , how about ou ?"
1431,i follow the nfl around playoff time . i like thos games because the stakes are high and there is a lolt of energy .
1432,sam ehere . maybe a bit more tahn the 11 minutss of average live game play .
1433,"i thought it would be more , but i guees the players are waiting and standing a lot . still lots of injuries in just 11 minutes ."
1434,yeah . had to be a lot more action in hat 222 0game . hard to score that much in q1 minutes .
1435,yes . i thought that lb0wout was cruel . what was the point therd ?
1436,"i am not sure . but major kudos to the losing team , it isnt easy to keep going like that but they did ."
1437,"yes , they played the game that should never have been scheduled . i wonder what their coach said to them after the game ."
1438,"i dont know , jtat would be a hard thing to coach them through . i wonder if there is a mercy rule enacted after that ."
1439,"perhaps there is . i thought one team would put in its weakest payers to balabnce things out ,. maybe even the cheerleaders ."
1440,"speaking of cheerleaders , dijd you ehar about how the saints cheerleaders are treaed ?"
1441,"the cheerleaders in the nfl are underpaid and overworked . they are sex symbols , but really get littl erespect ."
1442,they also cant ear in thes qme restaurant as a player and if a player walks in they ave to leave .
1443,i think that ystem is sexist . why did htey institute that ? was there a problem withr omznce or something ? is that even legal .
1444,"i dont even know . i mean if there was a problem with romance , tyne you adfress it with the people it applies tp . they are adults , they should be responsible for their own decisiosn ."
1445,exactly . no need for ridiculous rules that make the cheerleaders look like hussies .
1446,for real . i heard they also must blodk players from following them on social media .
1447,"hm . i guess there have been problems with relationships . well , everybody is entitled to make mistakes . i figure they are responsible adults . anyway , great chat !"
1448,it was a good chat ! have a great night !
1449,did you know that the average nfl game only had 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
1450,"that roes not surprise mehere is wso much sto0ping and gfoing . i guess if you add it up over the 16 games a team plays over the course of a regular season , it's a couple of hours haha"
1451,since i do not watcu fotball iw ould not mind o fth egames reflectes those few ghours qithout the sveraging lol
1452,"ye s, i think thew ay other varieties of football are played in other countries are a more efcicient use of time"
1453,possibly . do you think it is relaly impossible fo rto separate two phone books that have their pages overlapped ?
1454,"ell , i suppose you could just bur nhtem ! it's a good thing they're obsolete ; did you know that in iphone has more computing powe5 than rhe entre us nuclear icbm deterrenrt ?"
1455,that is true . it would be less tjme consuming lol i had no idea . i wonder if that is true for all iphones or any of the m.
1456,"it's amazing how physidally fragile all of our informaion systems are , considering how much data tehy store wnd move . the phone and ijtenret data cables on the ocean rfloor are only 2 . 7 ' im diameter !"
1457,it really is amazain g? that is such a tiny cable to be responsible for transporting our data . and we trust it makew it even more odd . at leasr it nas been sturdty so frar !
1458,"yes , fhere still isd some robustness in metal and plastic objets . remember rotary phones ? ny has the 212 area code because it'sz the quickest number to dial on one of those ."
1459,rotady phones should make a come back ; i want to know why 212 was chosen for new york nad not for somewhere else .
1460,"i bet it' sbecause it was the biggestc ity in aemdica in the bdginning of the 19th century , as it is now , . i don't imagine too many peope had phones on the west coast back then , it would'v ebeen crazy expensive to get those cables in place !"
1461,i was thinking that had to have been the case .
1462,"yes ,t hey didn't relaly have radio back then , either , and now it's used to transmit internet data and track football players moves via hcips in their should pads !"
1463,they really have internet data sto5ed in chips in the shoulder pads of football plaers ? ?
1464,"3ell , wifi uses radio waves to relay information , as do rfid chips that they use to track objects' movement and identify pe6s and stuff ."
1465,i didn't know anyone was trackibgf ootball player activity though . i don't know much about football or what they do outside of the field .
1466,"wlel , both nfl ppayers and those associated with them have to foll9w rules . new orleans saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat in th same restaurant as an nhlf player !"
1467,their rules need updatihng a litftle . i suppose the separation oft he cheerleaders and the team ix to keep focus .
1468,"yes , especially since they have such short careers as players . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than that of an average nfl player !"
1469,wow ! most nfl players seem to not really make muc hmoney at all . good thing i notice a lot attend college or plan to after retiring or forced retirement .
1470,siome players say that their mzjor in college was staying eligible . . . it's a petty bleak future fort hem if they don't save their money and set up business opportunities whi8le they're famous .
1471,very true . it helps to invest whilre you havde soke value and a positivse public opinion .
1472,"yes . nice chatting , have a pleasant evening !"
1473,you too !
1474,bye .
1475,i had a good super bowl weekend . do you enjoy the fnl ?
1476,"i didb't catch the game due to lack of cabel . i prefer college , but i watch nfl games every now and then ."
1477,it was not a good game but i got ro eatb ad foor hah a . di dyou know that in a game there is only an average 1 1minutes of actual gameplay ? that's insane when games are that long .
1478,"it really is crazy to think that out ofa n hour lpong clock time , 3 hours or so of time the gwme takes , that there is only thatm uch reala ction in the game . i think it is interesting that the lifetime earnings of an engineer exceed that o fthe average foobtall playrr ."
1479,that is surprisingt o me . it's much less difficult on your body so i would lean towards going that route . i just recently learned that the nfl has no written rules against female pla7ers .
1480,"i don't know if a femlae has ever played in the nfl , but i herd a few yearsa go tht there was a female referee on one of the crews ."
1481,i don't know of any female players . aparently they wouldh ave to meet the league's eligibility requirements and i'm not sure waht those are . i don't know if very many women would be large enough .
1482,"i agree , as an athletic woman myself , and knowing some very fit women , none of t5hem would stand a chande being smashed by some of those guys . nor would they want to . you onlyg et one body ."
1483,"agreed . a lot of those guys are enormous . as a woman myself i do not appreciate te sexis, that the saints treat their cheerleaders with ."
1484,"i knowe ! that is crazy . i am surprised that things like tha tcan even happen today . i have too muhc respect for myselt to ever agree to something so sexist , or stu09d . they ehould be able to eat where tehy want when they want , regardless of who walks in ."
1485,yes . i can't believe they have to stop eating tyheir food if a player enters nd leave . they were there first . what is the reasonin gbehind that kind of treatment ?
1486,entitlement . i ca't think of any other reason . i have known a person who wa a bucs cheerleader . as well as a woman 2ho played gaelic football ; she was one tough chick .
1487,sounds like it . i have also heard htat most cheerleaders make ar0und minimum wage which is also ridjculous . dod youk now that they use chips 8n the footballd wand players shoulder pads to track every novement ?
1488,"i had heard something about helmets to track movement for concussions , but i just heard about pads recently . if they have all that technology , the i don't know why there are so many questionable calls ."
1489,i was iust going to ask that . why don't they uset hat then instead o fjust reviews ?
1490,i wonder if it is to just track speed and impact like the sensors in the balls . but even the sensors in the balls can track location .
1491,yes i do not understand it . did you know that i nthe1 960's pro bowlers made more than pro football players ? that seemd razy now .
1492,"it does , but so does espn wijjing an emmy for creating the yellow line in the football games . sometimes , things don't make sens e, you just have to smile and accept it ."
1493,i'mv ery glad that they created that . i can't imagine watching a gake and tracking it without hat line . have you ehard ofb enjarvus greenellis ?
1494,"i know , the line s a life saver ,w hen my mom watched her first high school footballg ame for ny hrother she wonderdd why it wasn't there . lol ."
1495,ha ha . it makes watching way easier .
1496,"hello ! here's a shout out to the 212 , ny are acode that is . . . , you know why they chose 212 ?"
1497,"actually , no , i don't knowm uch about area codes !"
1498,212 was th easiest number to dial on hte old rotary phones !
1499,hah ! that actially mqakes a lot ofs esne ! i didn't kno that but i did know that the guy who invented the dial telephone was an undertaker !
1500,that's a gu6 i sould jnot want a call from ! you know the unicef will doante clena water tn eedy children for every minute you o not use your phone ! sometimee it pays to shut down !
1501,"i had no idea about that ! i will have to look into that . soubd slike you know a lot about technology , do you kno wanything about the nfl ?"
1502,sure ! thes average gameplay time in an nfl game 9 sonly 11 minutes ! we make a lot of fuss over 11 minutes ! are you a football fan ?
1503,i'v just started to understand it a little bit better . that's crazy baout the gameplay time ! i kust found out that nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players 'shouoder pads to record all their moves !
1504,"yeah , and i think new orleans tracks their lcations kff of the field too ! they do not allow cheerleaders to eat at teh samer estaurants as hte players . who keeps t4ck of that ?"
1505,well that's pretty crazy ! funny story snoop dogg actually wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team . i bet that would be interesting to hear !
1506,awesoem ! you what else i love about football ? those yellow lines they project on the tv screens to keep track of the location of yard wticsk . espn won an emmy for thinking that one up !
1507,"yeah , that actually helped me a lot shen i first started trying to figure out football ! the american flags ats tadiums are pretty amazing too . they wei8gh 1100 pounds !"
1508,"nice ! that's a lot of pomp for those circumstances ! and to think that back in the q960s , the best bowlers jade twife as much money as the top football players ."
1509,"what ? ? thats' pretty incredible . did you ever keep up with the whole debacle wuith urabn meyer , the football coach from ohio state ?"
1510,"no , what happened ? did he take his team to the univ of iowa visitors ;in klocker room and freak out ?"
1511,apparently there were a bunhc of domestic violence allegations against him from a former assistant and he didn't handle it very well !
1512,"didb't handle it ell ? perahps , maybe if he had taken lessons from the patriot's benjarvus greenellis . their former running back who never fumle a football his entre nflc areer , tehn he would have handled it better !"
1513,"haha ! that's a pretya mazing stat . well , theres' a long line of domestic violence in the nflt hat's just kind of been glossed over , so i think tjere's a pattern there unfortunately ."
1514,"i imagine there was a bit of violence after the historic 2220 lolss cumberland suffered at the hands of georgia tech . it had to be off the field , because it doesn't look like cumberland even showed up for the game !"
1515,whoa ! ! i've nevrer heard of that happening before ! do you know what year that happened ?
1516,"1915 . and after 104 years , it is still a record ! nice chating with you !"
1517,do you watch football a lot ?
1518,"hi , no i don't but i do sometimes . i think it is a great sport !"
1519,i am not too into it myself . perhaps it's becaus there are only 11 minuteas of live gameplay on average in each game .
1520,"very true ! it takes hours to watch lol , i think it's great that the nfl has no written rules against female players , . . ."
1521,"yah , i wonder if any women will ever meet the requirements . i just wizh that peopel were more willing ro watch women's professional x;orts ."
1522,me too ! i love women's sports ! i think it's crazy that rhe new orleans sa8nts cheerleaders are never allowed to eat awt the same restaurant while any nfl pal7ers are dining in !
1523,"yeah , i wonder why that is . it's crazy how gloeified foo6ball players are . in the 60s , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
1524,"wow , that is ihteresting , you would never think thag could be 6rue ! i find it interesting too that the nfl use stracking chips in the players shoulder pads to record their moves on the field , i had no idea !"
1525,"yeah , it's interesting how much attention is put into technology in the nfl l did you know espn wona n emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line ?"
1526,"really ? that' sawesome , it is a good invention for sure . i didn't know teh nfl merged with rhe afl way abck in 1966 , never knew that !"
1527,football has progressed so much . i don't think we've seen a score as bad ast he cubmerland football game in 1916 where they lost 0 to 222 .
1528,"wow , that is a high score ! i think ut's great that everson griffewn spoke up about his mental health issues after h etook time off from the vikings anc when he came back he spoke openly about it . i think their is shch stimga zbout mental health that was brave of hik !"
1529,"yeah , it seems like a lot of nfl players battle with depresion , and soe of them do not want to speak up about it . steve smith sr . recently tlaked abou tbattling depression as swell . be's one of the toughest wide receivers ."
1530,"i read about that too , more and more people are coming forward about it and i think it is a good thing . laso brian dawkins spoke about gis depression during his hall of fame imduction speec h. great men ."
1531,it must be hard to admit shat he did .
1532,"hed id and even other athletes have come forward about their struggles who play othyer sports as wel l, even michael phelpa came forwqrd about ui sstruggles ."
1533,"yeab , and joe barksdale not only came forward about suicide consideration but also about the abuse he suffered as a child ."
1534,"wow , that'w amazinga n dbrave of him to do , none of that can be easy to discuss bu tt helps others to seek treatjent and we need tha ina merica , nfls brandon marshall has caleld it the xivil rights issue of our era ."
1535,i agree . griffen said thath e got treatment and it was the right thing for him . hopefully thatm akes others brave enough t seek treatment .
1536,i think it alr4ady has among these athletes and hopefully this spreads the positivity to others yo get help and suicide is not the answer . very good thing these men who are looked at as invincible and strong can even ahve these issues . . .
1537,"yeha , it is interesting to lea5rn the men behind their tough fwcades ."
1538,"hi , do you have a favorite foobtall team ?"
1539,"gooed mornimg . yes , i do the new engladn patriots . how about you ?"
1540,same here awnd i can't believe th3 running back benjarvusg reenellis haw never fumbled the football not even once ! thats' no easy feat !
1541,"no , it's not . i can't iamgine the pressurw he felt ! do yo watch any socder ?"
1542,"yeah that's immesne stress ! i do , someti,es , zctjally i yhink i only watch the world cup , do you ?"
1543,"that's about how much i watch too . i read somewhere that snoop dog wrote a fight song for his son's igh schoo, football team . how cool is that ?"
1544,"tha'ts pretty n3at . i wonder how much game time the average high school foobtlal team has , it's got to be more tha nthe nfl which only ha s11 minutes ofl ive gameplay !"
1545,"i know that's true and so hard to bleieve . that last superbowl iw atched was about 3 hours long . i tell you , i was shocked to fidn out those humongous us flags st football stadiujms weigh like 1100 po9unds and costa bout 50 , 000 to make !"
1546,"exactly , with only eleven minutes of game playa nd yet i devotea n entire af6ernoon or evening to watching the games ! hey look very heavy but i didn't realize they were that expejsiov e, has anyonw ever tried ti steal it ?"
1547,"idk ? probably bev er hard to smuglge out weighing that much ! lol i know nlf footall is popular , but ih ad no idea college footblal was so populat , aslo . 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college footgball teams ."
1548,"tha's true too ! wow , do you have a favorite collee football team ? i wonder if the college cheerleaders are treated like the saints hceerleaders where they are forbidden to eat in the presence of the football players !"
1549,"yes , my alma mater , iniversity of florida gators . go fators ! that's a weird rule they have , makes you wonder whath appened to prompt that rule to be put in place ?"
1550,"oh my goodness ! i used to live in jacksonville so i know wha tyou're talking about ! exactly and how come no cheerleader has come out to speak up about it , maybe theyw ant to avoid bad publicity but i think it's doing the exact opposite !"
1551,"me too ! you know as big as nfl and college football are , there is a high school football stadium in texas that seats 18 , 000 and cost 60 million to build ."
1552,"i have never been to that styadium , i have been to a cou;le longhorns games but i don't think that stadium seats as many people as 18 , 000 ! so it's true , ' everythin'gs bigger in texas ' , even stadiums !"
1553,"apparently , that is true ! on a different note , do you own a car ?"
1554,"yes , i do own a car and drive through the drivethru of restaurants all the time , the drivethru came about from mcdonald's to accommodat esoldiers who weren't allowed to get out of theit cars whil ewearing their uniforms , that's a great invention !"
1555,"yeah , tha twas nice of mcdonald's to do and it has revolutionized the fast food industry for sure . i just moved to ohio , wehre it is cold and just fohnd out t is illegal to warm my car up in the morning . isn't that crazy ?"
1556,"wow , i didn't know that , so i guess dar sellers can't advertise the cars come with remote start function !"
1557,"9t's useless up here . i can't wait to get back to florida . i freeze every ,orning !"
1558,"lol , i hope you stay warm and i also moved from the south up to the north , i still can't get over having to shovel the driveway every morning !"
1559,"hi , how are3 you doing today ?"
1560,"i'm doing ok , have you heard of cte ?"
1561,"yeah , it seems awfully scary for footabll players ."
1562,"yeah , i'm not surprised it reminds me of punchd runk boxers ."
1563,"i've heard that north carolina football coach , larry fedora has questioned the relationship between football and cte and some have bacekd him , like fox sports . o' mnot so sure ."
1564,i saw that . they should question i t. the problem is that they have not founr a way to diagnose it until after death whe nthey can look at your brain .
1565,"bad way to ge a djagnosix . i agree fiotball is a lots afer , nowadays . but , some of those collieions are pretty ha4rd ."
1566,"yeah , i tis still brutal if you play . the nfl did concede 2 ytears ago the connection ."
1567,"fedora and cte is kind of like trump and climate chanhge . lol but , i thinkt here are many sports where your head can get banged pretty hard , besides football ."
1568,what is climate change ?
1569,global warming or clikate change lol all the same
1570,di dyou know the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is paitned pink ?
1571,high intimidation facror there . do you watch any canarian football ?
1572,i have seen a few games . we just watched teh suer bowl here on sunday .
1573,"cool , were you rooting fo rth epatriots to win the super bowl again ?"
1574,neither team . the game wasn't that good eitehr . apparently espn won an emmy for the creation o fthe superimposed yellow line for irst downs .
1575,"i agree it was a pretty non descript game , lowest scoring game eer . i didn't know that baout espn winning an emmy for creation of 5the yel,ow lines for first downs"
1576,"i have to admit , they deserve the emmu for iy . it make sthe game enjoyable . apparent.ly green ellis nsver fumbled in his career ."
1577,i agtree . that;s an impressive feat5 to never hage fumbled a ball hise whole career .
1578,"yeah , he must have been a great player . in the 1960s bowlers made twice as kuch as top football p.ayers ."
1579,"that's funny about the bowlers , especially knowing how much money these football stars get paid today . however , the waverage lifetime eanings of an enhineer is highd rthan the average lifetime earnings of a nlf player . plus , you don't have to worry about cte ."
1580,"i'm not surpris3d , the less known palyers probably only play a year or so ."
1581,hi ! guess what's allowed in south africa to prevent car jacking ?
1582,"i guess you can use fla,ethrowers on your cvar to keep someone from car jnacking yu . how does that work ?"
1583,i don't know ! i'd like to see it . cars sure have com ea long way sibce they were first made available to the general public in 1908 .
1584,"the first modern carw as made by a german inventor , karl benz ."
1585,yes . i wonder if mercedesbenz is anmed afgter nhim . i hadn't know nhtat cars came from germany . they seem so american .
1586,i believe htat they were . i was aurprisedt o find out that the mcdonald's drive thru was designed for soldiers who couldn't get out of their cars in their fatigues .
1587,"yes , it's interesting that they were nt allkowed to exit their cars while wearing fatigues . i don't think that rule ezists anymore . i wonder what the reasoning behyind i twas ."
1588,"it wad in the 1970s , so maybe there was a lot ofa nimosity because of the vientam war ."
1589,"yes , 1975 . 89 years after the birtg of the modern car ."
1590,the old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back . thatg's why 6he back of the car is called the trunk .
1591,yes . it amkes sense . although the trunk is called a boot inm the uk . i hope they didn't make cars with an actual boot on the back .
1592,that would be funny . maybe yhat's where the saying ' kick him to the curb ' cam efrom .
1593,youn ever know ! did you know that cars were lsower toc atch on in europe than america ? i wonder whne they caught on in other parts of 5he worl .
1594,i don't know . i think that henry ford made them more accessible with his interchangeable parts .
1595,"yes , 6the model t ."
1596,the cadillac car brand was also mad ein detroit and was named after a frnech explorer .
1597,yes ! the areival of carsr eally transfoemed detroit .
1598,i wonder what led to the cityg's downfal l. there is a lot of media coverage about the downtrodden city of detroit .
1599,"yes , i think that also has to do with cuanges in 6the automotive industry . nut maybe it will recover . did you know that someone became za pro race car driver by beatin g90 , 000 people a tgran turismo ?"
1600,"no , i didn't ! i wonder how he even did that ?"
1601,i have no idea ! i'll look it up and give you a clal later on . 9t's been great talking . have a good da6 !
1602,hey do you ever watch football on tv ?
1603,"hello there , i do , did you watch the super bowl recetnly ?"
1604,i did watch it with the patrijots . they are awesome ! did you know a teak in iowa painted the opposing team's lockerroom pink ?
1605,"yeah the patriots won again , very impressive . and i read that , i woner wgo gave the final ok for htem to do that q"
1606,yeah i don't kjnow . have you ever gone bowling ? the top bowlers used to make twice as much as thet op football players
1607,i love going bowling and thts hows how far the nfl has come since back then .
1608,bowling is awesome ! i wish i ciulds ee the highestever scoring footnall game . it sounds like a major blowout . 2220 !
1609,that sounds like no defense or even no other team evnes howed up to play tjhat one !
1610,no i feel bad fkr cumberland ;. they got a complete blowout on that gamdh aha . this was back in 191 6though .
1611,"yeah same here , i wonde rhow many oft he fans were still there wshn the final whistle blew ?"
1612,yeah i would have left almost immediately baha . do you like the patriots though ? benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball and he plays fo rthem
1613,"i don't like them , but think they are one of theb est twams ever this pazt decade or so . and tat is incredibl e!"
1614,i agree ! have you ever seen football on tv and they have the yellow line that makes the first don marker ? that was developed by esepn adn they won an emmy
1615,"yeah i remember when they first came up with that , it really helped make 5he game more exciting to watch on tv ."
1616,itr definitely makes it s lot easier to follow . did you knowt hat the nfl allows female players technically .? there is ni rule against it
1617,"i rdead that , i think it would be so col if a female player made a pro roster sooh ."
1618,"yeah i think that will happen in our lifetime . what is weird tob e is taht na averag enfl game only last for about 11 minutes , if you're counting life gamepay"
1619,"that is weird , i don't think you notice sop much when watching on tv but do when attending live games ."
1620,well the super bolw this year was kind of boring so i kind of noticd haha . did you hear abou thow the new orlean ssaints treat their cheerleaders ?
1621,"yeah it wasn't as exciting as last years that sfor sure . and i read that , sees a bit outdate dto me ."
1622,yeah they shouldn't have to leave if a player comes into a resturant that they're already sitting at . that is so stupid
1623,hello do you like football ?
1624,"yes , i do , do you ? i n1960 top bow.ers mace more mon3y tba nfootball stars ."
1625,"i do liek it but i do not follow it .t hats pretty amazing , must have been a good time to eb a bowler ."
1626,"yes ,2 220 is a defeated game in 19q16 !"
1627,that is a very mpressive scor eby geofgia tech .
1628,"yes , very . hard to beliee there is a football locker room painted pink in iowa !"
1629,"yeah must be a tacdtic of so,me sort , i think to soften them, up ."
1630,"yes , that ould . no written rule asgainst female playsers ."
1631,"thats interesting , i wonder why we dont se enore fejale gootball ;layers then"
1632,"i knows , didn't know new olreans cheerleadersh ave to leave a restaurant if any nfl player come in ."
1633,that is really rude . maybe the football players should give them a schedule of whre they are eating so the cheerleaders can plan accordingly instead of havin gto leave in mid meal
1634,a better ide a! those tracking chips must hepp alot !
1635,is amazing what tehnology cxontributes to sports
1636,"agree , how would you like your car equipped with a flamethr9wer ? lol"
1637,"eee k. i dont think i have a need for a flame throwe , maybe if i lived in snow lol"
1638,"ha , ha , ha . yds ! did you know how the name of trunk for teh car was from wooden 5trunks ?"
1639,"i guess that makes sense , they us3d to tie them to the backs of cars ."
1640,"yes , can't imagine beating 90 , 000 people n a video game ."

1680,"very cray , i love how they have new tech in the sport as well . lost of tracking going on with the embedder shoulder pads"
1681,"yeah , that's prrtrty cpol all the new technology . kind of scary howc loselye very move is watched on the field ."
1682,cont like how they make so much money much like enginners
1683,well actually . i read somewhere that teh average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher tahn the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player .
1684,"yeah they do , doesnt seem like thats how it should work , but ok . they buy al lthe tghings they wan witl that money . likef ast cars"
1685,do you own a car ?

1687,"that's cool , well its' been nice hatting . i need to get to w0ork , i'll talk to you later , friend ."
1688,daniel snyder is a great businwss man although im hot sure if cutting links with his radio stations is the best choice
1689,he seems to be . . . but he can't run an nlf franchise if you ask me !
1690,"yeah i agree , the redskins are an ordinary team , that could change under ab ete rmanagement , ,aybe he doeznt have the time ,"
1691,lol . . . he's a business man that owns a multimillion doplar granchise . how is that an excuse ?
1692,"we.l maybe the radio statiohs take too much of his time and thats why he decided to cut them loose , do you listen to the radio anymore ?"
1693,"i am sure if someone can make a ventriliquist actb e succesful o nradio , then there is no excuse for him . by the way can you pleas eresponx faster ? i don't have all day !"
1694,"ok sorry im just a slow typer , there is a canadian law thatg says that 40 percent of the music has to be canadian"
1695,yeah i saw that ! i wanna hear solar qctivity into sound thts cool !
1696,"that does sound cool , j7piter a,so has storms that are so strong an wm frequnecy can pick tehm"
1697,"man . . . can you believe that the only president ever to have a phd was woodrow wilson , tahts crazy !"
1698,that is crazy ! the only one ? at least we dont have pop stars running the country
1699,"and the last president to speak a foreign languag4 was fdr , . . geez !"
1700,"we should have better educated presidents , the nuclear football shouldnt be taken lightly , what are your thoughs on trump ?"
1701,he's fine . . . . i think all politicians are fake . . . he's probably the most real one we have had in s l9ng time .
1702,"i see , well he sure is reating controversy in the white house , hois guest house is lrger than the white house that must b ea really big house"
1703,"u a , sure it is . . . it is fo rthe president !l ol see snoop wrote a fight song for h8s hs ?"
1704,"i didnt catcyh that one , do you watch the chanel espn ?"
1705,"i used to , but i don't have cable anym0ore ."
1706,"i see , well spn won an emmy because tehy createdt he yello3 first d0own line in footbll ,"
1707,wow . . . that's awesome ! i love that yellow line ! ! ! see college stadiums are some of the biggest stad8iums in the world ?
1708,realy ? bigger than pro football stadims ? they must cost a lot of money to be built
1709,great chat . . . thanks for pickin gup the pace !
1710,"hi , uow are you ?"
1711,do you like the nfl ? i read the otger day that th average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameaplay
1712,i love the nlf . only 11 ninutes ? tje junpero serra high school kjv football team recorded a historically bad season in whic hthey failed to win a game or even score a touchdown yet thyey never attempted to tart their backup uarterback . that backup quarterbavk they refused to starr 9s 4 time super bowl champion tom brady .
1713,wow that is crazy . i also saw tht the nfl has no written rule against fsmale players
1714,"i am watching the pats game now and there's the first female official working the post season , sarah thomas ."
1715,that is interesting . i sawt hat the nfl uses tracking cips embedded in players shoulder pads to reclord a playerz every move
1716,"i pove chips . hopefully doritos . . . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that ne entered university as a junior . 6he quzrterback received his bachelor's egree in two years , and begna working on a master' sdegree , before becoming the first overall pick in the 29005 nfl draft ."
1717,"wow that sounds g4reat . i just saw that the averag elifetime earnings of an engineer is higher thaj the average lifetkme earnings ofa n nlf player , maybe staying in school is good !"
1718,"the citcular huddle used in today samerican football was created by paul d .h ubbard , a deaf quarterback , sl the other team could not read gis hand signals ;"
1719,oh well that is helpful for sure . i saw somethign strnage . the ne worleans saints cheereladers are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any fnl player and if they are laready dinimg and one walks in they are required to leave
1720,"thats sexist . . . . baker mayfield , quarterbaco , university of oklahoma , onc econsidered quitting fooyball to pursue fulltime cvom0etitive gaming , and claims to ve abe to ebat anyone att he university of oklahoma oneonoen in halo 3 ."
1721,ha ha thats funny . i saw tha tthe university of iowa's lofker room for visiting football team is painted pink .
1722,speakking of football . . . kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nld
1723,wow that is crazy that he is tbe only one . did you know that the higjest score ever in a football game occured in 1916 when georgias tech defeated cumberland 2220
1724,"you gotta pull the qg at 600 , right ?"
1725,i am not certain about that . i saw that the espn won an emmy for the creation of he superimposed yellow line representing the firsts down line for american football tgaems
1726,the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women woul din fact be allowed if th3y met the league's eligibility requirements .
1727,that eould be fun to see . i saw that former pati9otsr b benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the footballp i nhis nf lcareer
1728,the law firm . . . the average ljfetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and na average mlb player .
1729,"yes , i think i've heard thaf hbefore . in the 1960' topb owlers made twice a smuch as top football starts"
1730,nice chatting with you . . .
1731,do you everk eep up on brett favre since his retirement ? apparently he auditioned for monday night football
1732,"ohw ow didn't nkow that , did you know that the nfl has no rules against female players ?"
1733,i guess it's one of those ruled people don't know about since no one has done it . another rule people likely don't know is that cheefleaders for the saints aren
1734,"ya i don't like how they aren't allowed to eat with players , that seems like an outtdated rule and also really dumb"
1735,there might be a legitimate reason for tha trule though . all th erules in the nflm ake the 11 minu6es of live gameplay seem longer than it really is
1736,"ya they definitey strethc taht over 3 hours sometimes , did you know the avg earnings of an engineer is more than that of an nfl playier ?"
1737,"i guess engineers make enough per year and have a longer career . plus , then tey're nlt at riskf or injury . still , a 17 week season wouldn't b3 terrible"
1738,"thats true , thats lots of down time m are you aware of teh traqcking chijps the nfl uses ?"
1739,i heard there's chips in the footballs and shouler pads to keep trackl of speed and all the stats the dieahrd fans care about . its' prett ciol how that works
1740,"that is cool , hopefully they dont use those on the saints cheer4leaders , that would be creepy !"
1741,very true ! thats' much more strange than the visitor's locker roim for football at the university6 of iowa being painted plink
1742,"ya that is weird , i wonder if that hurts or helps them , i think that would make me play better haha"
1743,"but still not as good ae rv nenjarvus greenellis . in all his nfl career , he nevr fumbled the ball"
1744,"haha true ! crazy how polpular b9wling as in the 60s , the top bowlers made nmore than football players !"
1745,i wonder if televisio nhasc yanged that . espn might have had a hand in that like htey did with the yellow line they created for the first down
1746,"good pion t, can't believe theh ighest scoring football game was 2220 , thats a blowout !"
1747,"i feel bad for cumberlan , but maybe that was a really good season for gsorgia tech"
1748,"haha true ,d o you think kellan moore being left handed give hi man advantage ?"
1749,"ive heard that left handed qb's throw with a reverse spin , so his teammates would have tog et used to that . maybe that's w3hy hes' the only lefty in the nfl"
1750,"huh that ies interesting , did you hear about how smart alex smith was in schlol ?"
1751,didn't he start college as a junior adn even started on a master's degree before beinh drafted in the nfl ? that takes a lot of dedication
1752,"oh ya , he could have done a lot even outsid eof the nfl"
1753,"hi , how are you ? are you a fan of sports ?"
1754,"yea , i like the nlf . , don't think colt mccoy's signing with the redskins was sa good move"
1755,"mccoy could have had bettee , you 5hink ? where else ?"
1756,"i think colt mccoy made out good , he gets to stay with coach jay gruden , i think the redzskins could of found someone better or paid less f9or him"
1757,xo the skins have a choice ? will thed talent come to the skins ? i figure they gptta comete hard fort he best .
1758,well they did have alex smith and were on the way to the playoffs unti her got injured and 32 year ol dmccoy started
1759,thems are the breaks . i figure thats omeway they can find a como o fr band qb that will make te yardage to win .
1760,"yea , i guess gruden finds mccoy a great ide.ine presence"
1761,gruden has lost my fr4nds too much money . i think tht he should pay them for all their osses . maybwe he should let womne play on the team .
1762,"wel thee is no rule in 5he nfl against women player , i'm sure they could be place kickers at least"
1763,i bet on teh skins they coulsd play other positions . maybe even coach . they could start with placekicker . i would bet on that .
1764,i wonder jfg gruden was the coach f tom brady's jv footbla team that failed to start him or win ag ame
1765,that jv coac hprobaboy had a persnality issue with tom . tom wouldn't eat his wife's strawberry shortcake or somethintg .
1766,probably . did you know alex smith started colleg eas a junior and was working on a masters before being drafted ?
1767,he was a genius ! how many football players could do something liike that ? he must have been the smartest qb of his class .
1768,on the othed side of hte spectrum baker mayfield was considering being a comptitive gamrr instead of a qb
1769,"i wouldt otally go football . the cash , the wome n, the fame . no video games ."
1770,"yea , plus the averge nfl game only has na average of 11 minutes of gameplay"
1771,"that is insnae . youc an't get hours like that playing video games . anyway , great chat !"
1772,"you t9o , i think i'm going to watch sme footbalo on es0pn and enjoy the emmy winning yellow lin ethey invented"
1773,"yes , that line was a beeakthrough . like walkling on th m0on . thanks !"
1774,have a good one
1775,"i think trhat jon gruden is a sensible loss for thue team ,"
1776,what do you mean by sensible lss ? i think john gruden is a huge mistsake for the team .
1777,"well i think his a good player , hard to replace , thats what i meant or at least i th raiders team his becoem an important piece for the coaxh"
1778,jhn gruden is an nfl head coach . he's not a player . the 333 loss to teh rams was just the beginninh of a miserable season . are you familiar wit hthe fnl ?
1779,"oh i see l i guess im confusing him with a player of the team , what was his nqame i think it was khalil mack , and i do follow some gmaes what about you ?"
1780,football is ond of my favorite sports and i tollow all 32 teams . khali lmack was traded tk the bears by john grude nfor some picks . they definitely felt his absecne . i dont know why they didn'tj ust resign him .
1781,maybe he demaqnded a high saalry ? what is your favorit nfl team ?
1782,"i like the ginats best , you ? . he did demand a high sakary . he' the highest paid defensive player in the nfl . i guess the raiders tied up too much money in carfr and gruden ."
1783,"i like the patriots best and yeah tjats probalbyt he reason then , too much money but i mean he might be worth it , theres few palyers with hi sskills in the league ."
1784,wel lcongratulations on the super bowl . did you know the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of game play ? no wonder my girlrriend gets bored .
1785,"thanks , ir was a boring superbowl but good thing the patr8iots won that cheered me up , and no , i didm't know that so out of the 3 hours a game lasts ojly 1q minutes are of actual hameplay ? wow"
1786,yeah who knew ? it's quite an i9nteresting game znd a big business . they use tracking chips embedded in shoulder lads now to track players .t hey even have htem inside footblals now .
1787,"thats interesting inde3d , i wonder how that has changed the game , i bet all kinds oc iteresting stats are available npw because of that data"
1788,espn actually won na emmy fortg he creation of the yellw line for 1st downs on tv . the powe rof technology .
1789,"i guess that did change the game f9rever , i think it's a well deserved award ."
1790,do you follow any other mkinds of foobtakll besides americam fooptball ?
1791,"i liek soccer as well , in fact is one of my favorite sports , i also like rughy ,w hat about you ?"
1792,i mostly just a american footabll guy . intseresting that rugby is also considered a type of football
1793,"yeah , rules are completely different but i gudess there are some similarities ."
1794,do you remember benjarvus greenellis ? he was a rb on the patriots .
1795,"yeah he never fumbled a ball , incredible player"
1796,are you a fan of the nlf ?
1797,i definitely am . watching the super howl hqs become a family tradition l wht about you ?
1798,the same i pike wathcing both college and nfl . do you have a favorite team ?
1799,"for college , yes , but i don't have a specific rooting interest when i comes to the nfl . i have a feeling i en dup chgeering on the american football confer4nce in the super bolw mor often than not ."
1800,"true , me too . my fav0rite college team is the iowa hawkeyes , have you heard of them ?"
1801,"it just so happens i have . i'm a nebeaska cornhusker fan , whidhm akesz us rivals , even if the last several years haven't gone our way , . i bet when we are the road team it's those pink visitor locker rooms that are doing u sin ?"
1802,"yikes lol . i think it does a lot of people in . i like nebraska footbal, too though , probably my second favorite big ten team . the pink is a calming effect ."
1803,hats off to you for being able to like both teams . i guess we wer esepaeated by conferences for a long time . at least we never had any 2220 type outvcomes on either side . can you imwgine what cjmberland must have3 felt in 1916 after georgia tech di dthat tok them ?
1804,"right , i think i would have quit right wfter the gam4 . or maybe after it was 1000 lol ."
1805,"considering i have never heard of cumberland , maybe that was it for them ? or maybe they lasted until the 1960s when , amazinlgy enough top bowlers were making twice what football players were ."
1806,"i cang' believe that , but i guessd it was more popular at that time . i wonder what the pay difference is now ."
1807,"i have no idea . i bet tv had a lot to do wit hthe shift thouhg . think about all the innovation in tepevision have come through sports . i c9uldn't imagine a game without the first down yellow line and havr to remember that idn't actually on the field . i give espn trouble , but all crecit to them for that creatjpon which eadned them an emmy ."
1808,"i love the yellow line , i 8used to think it was real when i was younger , glad to know it was digital lol"
1809,mayeb espn's tech department is filled with brilliant folks like alex smith who got is devree in two years !
1810,i think they are too . and the engineers o some crazy things . have you heard about the tracking chips they use ?
1811,"i know they invest a ton of money in the game , but i'dl ove to hear more aboutt hese chips ."
1812,"they put tbhem in footballs and shoulder pads to track velocity , speed , an dhow players move around the field . probably made by hte egnineers who amek more mon3eyd uring their lifetime tan the players"
1813,it's a rough sport ! i'ts crazy to think that just 11 minutes or o of actual game play or hiting over the course of three hours can be so camaging .
1814,wow they tkae a lot of blows so that is good it iw only that long ! it was so nice chatting with you !
1815,you as well ! have a great evening !
1816,"thanks , yoy as well !"
1817,do youl iek football ?
1818,i love it . do you know what color is the u of iowa visitorl ocker room ?
1819,yes it is pink but i a not sure why they chowse that color
1820,i wonder if i tis supposed to have some effect on them
1821,i wonder too . bowling was more popular tahn football in the 60s
1822,yes that is hwy bowlers made way more thah them
1823,wow cool . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
1824,"yest hat is 222 0, do you know who played ?"
1825,yes it aas georgia tech who beat cumberland in 1916
1826,ys . did you know espn won an m4my onjce ?
1827,yes they won it for the superimposed yellow line
1828,yes . do you know greenellis never5 fumbled teh ball ?
1829,amazing . did you know that wome ncan play in the nfrl ?
1830,yes th4re is no rule that says that they cannot play
1831,yes as long as they qualify they are good to go
1832,yeah . did you know the aferage live gameplay is only 11 minutes ?
1833,yes and yet we are glued to the tv fodeber
1834,true . engineers make more than rootbll players over the lifetime
1835,i guess it makes sense since they have longer careers too
1836,true . what do you thin kof that rule for saints cheerleaders ;
1837,it is sexist and needs to go ho4nstly . nice chat tonight
1838,are you interested in football ?
1839,"i am not . i wach it because i have a son who likes it . alsi , i think the saints are sexist with how they treat their cheerleaders , and the league should do something baout it ."
1840,you'ee right ! it's something about how cheerleaders and football plzyers can't be in the same restaurnat at th4 same tim ? that?s crazy ! i wonder what started that !
1841,"i don't know , but it must be frustrating to have to leave in the middle of your meal ."
1842,iw as surprised to learnt hat there isn o rule against female players being able to join a team . h5ey just have to meat all the same eligibility points as the men . it hink i saw an ad during the superbowl tha tfeatured a female player . have you see3n it ?
1843,"i have not seen it , i don't qatch the superbowl . i know there are a lot of girls who play in high school , many are kickers . i hope a woman decidest o try out one day ."
1844,something i juzst learned about football is that thec ircular hudle was invented by a deaf player who didn't want the other tea mto learn his ndigns
1845,that's interesting . especially since it os still in use today . it's funny that the top bowlers used to amke more than the top football playwrs .
1846,"k wonder how myuch that was ! do you think they used to pay football players wazy less , bowlers more or both ?"
1847,"i don't know , it was back in the 60'd . then again , enginedrs amke more than thre average player tjese days"
1848,"i think that's how it should be really . engineers are actually v9tla at times , football players not so much . did you know that there has only been one left handed quarterback in the nfl ? seems insane given the odds , right ?"
1849,that dles seem weird . i guess tere is a rb for the patriots qho has never fumbled .
1850,"that's interesting , although i'm always sspicious of the patriots after all that stuff about ' deflategate '"
1851,"nothing surprises me anymore . althoug h, with the browns getting obj in trade , i'm thankfu baker amyfield didnb't quit football to become a pro gamer ."
1852,"i can see th4 appeal , there's way less fisk in gaming than in football and sometimes the money can be pretty similr , right ?"
1853,"some of them makew millions at one tournament . i guess he's pretty good at halo 3 , which is a hard game ."
1854,i know about as much about halo as i do about tootball which isn't muvh ! haha did you know tht espn won an emmy for the creation of hte fake yellow line they show on football broadasts ?
1855,"wow . that must have been a bad year for hollywood , if they won for that . its fnny when you realize that to mbrady's highschool coach didn'tw ant to play him ."
1856,i wonder what the reason could be foe that ? do you think the coach waw sbad or he didn' tlike brady petsonally ?
1857,"maybe he was that bad ? lol , i know i shouldn't say that abouy a supr olw champ ."
1858,"maybe he just liked the othe rquarterback bettr ? haha well it was nice chatting with you , have a nice day !"
1859,ram's become t3h youngest head coach .
1860,thats really interesting . i wonrder if that effects the next years team

1869,it is very interesting . english publics chool played the importwnt role in the development of the football . the only organised the team and they teach the difference between running and carrying .
1870,the huddle was created by a deaf quartdrack .
1871,"in modern american football , the quarterback is usually considered the lwader of the offensibe team ."
1872,"yes , he calls the shots basically ."
1873,baker mayfield once xconsudered quitting football to pursue fulltime competitve gaming .
1874,"lol well professional gamers dont get injured as muc h, i say go for it ."
1875,while palying injury i sunavoidable . i ntraining only we avoid it .
1876,"yeah thats wh7y i suggest rkfessional gaming , they dont get injured lol"
1877,yes . it makes sense to protect from injury it is very hard to lift the trophy .

1887,yeah he is and he was so good in schoop he wrapp4d upl a college degree in two years
1888,w9w he must be brilliant or a very hard worker . i like quarterbacks since they lead the offende .
1889,"that is true . i think it is ab it of boht . he took many ap tests , tnat's why"
1890,"while i don't know much about alex , i tend to follow players like kellna moore who is the only left hnaded quarterbac kin the nfl"
1891,"that is amazing , amingst so many playersh e is the only one"
1892,i mean i know it is inherently harder if you a4e lefrt janded as a qn
1893,yeah . and baker mayfield once considered quitting to become a competitive gamer
1894,i also think brady johnson is impressive as well since he ahs even throns a touchdown pass to himsel.f

1900,"while there aren't any explicit rules against them , don't the 5equirements pretty much disqualify them anyway ?"
1901,"i am not toos ure , i hope not though . nicr chat"
1902,"dl you like a,erican football ?"
1903,i do ! i love football ! ! hard to believ the nfl is made up of 31 teams .
1904,it is harder to believe the average game onlyh as 1 1minutes of live gameplay
1905,that is crazy ! i know the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in plaers shoulder pads tor ecord a player4s every move on the field .
1906,they even put tyhem in the football itself
1907,"oh wow ! thzt is domething . it must be to track, ball velocity , rotation , ball speed and lpcation ."
1908,i hope this daa will help reduce thr numbe rof injuries to players
1909,"i do too ! did you know that the first nfl playoff game was playedd in 1932 on an 80 yard dirt field inside vhicago stadium , the then home to the blakcxhawks ."
1910,what ha shappened to it now ?
1911,"that i'm not sure og , but i know chicago has changed a lot ."
1912,no doubt . do you likea ny particular losition ?
1913,i would eay quarterback is one i know th emost about . i know that only two africanamer9can quarterbacks have wkon the super bowl .
1914,i like tom brady . hd is still a stellar athlete despite being round 40
1915,h eis . i agree . did you know kellan more is the only lefthandsd 2b in the nfp ?
1916,yes . he is deftinitely worth respecting since it is much harder to be left handdd as a qb relatively to other sports
1917,"i can't even imagine . superbowl winning quarterback , brqd johnson is the only quarterback in history to throw th ewinning touchdoan to himself !"
1918,i wonder how you would even throw the touchdown to yourself ?
1919,"t ad to be a rdcovered fumble . did you know that q brussel, wilson is still under contract for major league basbezall ?"
1920,really ?
1921,yes ! he has not playef since 0211 .
1922,that is why i was surprised . i should go check it out after this chat . thanks for chatting .
1923,how familiar are you with footbsll and the nfl ?
1924,"i don't follow pro football that much . i was following the saints , home team , hwen it looks like they were on track for another super bowl , but then got robbed of a victory ."
1925,but yu do know thaf the nfl is among the top 4 major professional sports leaues in north america
1926,"yes , it ha sa big draw , especially toeay when a lot of people are glued to their tvs fo5 the super bowl . wha tdo you thin of the quartebrack match up : patriots rbady ,m age 41 , versus rams mannion m, age 26 , ?"
1927,"i think it is an interesting one , but personally rooting for brady . i like the qb position the most since they ar ethe core of hte offense . do you like any position in particular ?"
1928,"it is a battl eof experience versus youth . i am not set on any position , but it ssems like in grade school footballb eing qb was everyone's goal . did you kno2 that the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback , paul d . hubbard , sot he opposing team could not read his hnad signals ?"
1929,"yes , aslo kellan moor is the onlyl eft handed qb in the nfl . i wonder if that is aa dvantage or disadvantage ."
1930,"i don't know , but doubt it . a left handed hitter is a plus in pro baseball , but i can't see it mat5ering in football . i tend to follow collegiat'e w more , my alma mzterl su . did you know uniersity of iowa painted the visito5's locker room pink ? you got to wonder if it is intimidation , disrespect , good humor , or a combination of those ?"
1931,i tend to follow players more than teams like green ellis 2whoh as never fumbled in hi sentire nfl career
1932,"i did too , louisiana boy terry bradshaw , qb for the steelers . he is one of the reasons the steelers have hte most super bowl wins o fany nfl team . if you followed the nfl pla6offs , you might have noticed that the nfl has a female ref , sarah thomas . do you think they will every have femalw players ?"
1933,well the nfl doesn't have any written rule againzst femlae players
1934,"we will have to wait and sees . some of he traditions i nfootball are peculiar , if not humorous . for example , saints hcearfleaders cannot be in the same resturant with any nfl player , even if they were there first ."
1935,"i agree . however , i think there are some interesting things going onf or the nfl , not just on the team level .f or instance , they are putting chips into players shoulderpads znd footballs to gather datw and make btter plays"
1936,"i would have liked to have known the g forces the saints receiver took in that ' no cal lpass interference ' play in the playoff game with hte rams . what do you think of the salaries . we now what hte stars make , bug not the backups and the 2nd string . i wonder how the average salary with the short career span stacks up againwt ohter jobs ?"
1937,"well the average lifetime easnrign of an engineser is higher thna that of an nfl , but you have to remember a you pointed out the hour they work respectively ."
1938,"they d ear nmore per hour playing , but it is a short career , often 10 years or less , while a good engineer would liekly get 3540 years of sergice . you brought p the chips in shoulde rpads , but other techs have also changed the game , or at least how it is viewed . did you know espn wo na nemy for teh tv ylelow line showing the first down position ?"
1939,"we,l the yelloa kine definitely helped many viewers better digest the situation and action on the field"
1940,"i agree . witht he yellow line , you can really visualizew how far they need to move the ball . it also lets the armhcair bqs speculate on what palys the real qbs will call . most of these guys are realy smart . did you know qb alex smith entered college as a junior and was working on a mawsters when he entered the nfl draft ?"
1941,"i agree tat most o fthese guys are brillint . i mean the average hfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay , but so much goes on in those few minutes that the espn won an emmy for helping to break it down and thsse players have tom ake the smart decision in fractions of seconds"
1942,"i agree , but they also have coach to qb communications in the qb's helmet these days . what i reallyd on't like is when the qb is a prima donna . they need great backs and receivers . like ebnjarvus greenellis who never vumbled in his nfl career ."
1943,"i agree . ina ny case , i enjoy our chat about football . thank you"
1944,same to you . i guess i will go man the grill for our half tim efeast .
1945,i hope you enjoy your feast . anything on the grill is always delicious .
1946,did you know that theoreticakly females can play fort tnhe nfl ?
1947,i heard about that . i wonder if a woman will ever play in the nfl . 8 heard there is a really gopod kicker who is in university righjt now .
1948,"see that would actually seem to be the most likely position , do they have a whole fmeale footbapl tezam at 5that school ? i haven't hewrd of thi s?"
1949,her name is ebcca longo . i believe seh plays on the men's team .
1950,"ah interesting , did you know the nuddle was inventd by a deaf quarterbacm a while ago ? h eused it to block the other team from seeing his hand signals"
1951,"cool . speaking of inventions int he nfl , esp won an emmy for creating th esuperimposed yellow line ."
1952,"that is crazy . it's something we take3 for granted , kellan moore is the sole lefthanded quarterback in the whole league , i wonder if that is an advantage or not ."
1953,"huh , interesting . i'm not really that into football , perhaps that's because tehre are only about 11 mihutes of live gameplay per game ."
1954,"ya i'm the ssme way , id on't care at all for football , bur i will watch the superbowl because my friend is having a party , what about you ?"
1955,"yes , my friend is having a pasrty too . i'm looking forward to it . i guess the super bowl is hbeld the first sunday in february each year ."
1956,"yes that is true , also wild how the nfl has chipa that are put in players c.orhes to record their stats , i guess that is good . it allows for lots of analytics , almost like a videogame"
1957,"yeah , it's crazy how seriously our culture takes footbqll . i guess that has evolved lately because in teh 1960s top bowlers mnade twice as much as top football stars ."
1958,"ya thqt iw wild , fefinitely the opposite today as far as pay goes , i think its crazy that an engineer will make , on average , more thqn a nnfl poayer ih their lifetime"
1959,"yeah , nfl ;layers really have to be careful abvout where 5hey spend , and i don'tt hink most of them are ."
1960,"no you're rightg , and apprently they have to be careful where they eat , for instance with the saints , cheerleaders aren' tallowed to eat ztt he same rsturant as any nfl player , and if an nfl player happens to come in then the cheerleadser os required to leave ."
1961,"hmm , that is an odd rule . it also strikes me as odd htat the university o iowa painted their visiting locker room pink . that must have been before pink became trendy for emn ."
1962,"hahw yes that is very odd , i wonder if that incteased or decreased their win percentage , i could see teams getting ma dand actually performing better"
1963,"haha , that is an interesting thought . some other number sthat i am curious about are the score from the football games in 1916 between georgia tefch and cumberland . gergia tehc won , 222 to zero . ho won earth did thath appen ? if only we had footage !"
1964,"yes i woudl watch that game ! although back in the day , i think i would have left after the score hi 1000 , there's no coming bqck from that haha"
1965,"another thign i find amazign is that benj arvus greenellis has neverf umbled the f9ootball in his nfl career ,"
1966,"that is crazy , think of his anxiety every time he gets hte ball , will this wb the day my record us ruined ? haha ,"
1967,hey did you know that the nf has no rule against having female players ?
1968,i was not aware of that . i'm surprised because they do have som esexist policies . di you know about their rueps regarding saints cheerleaders ?
1969,"i havem't heard about that , what are the rules ?"
1970,they are not allowed to eat in the samer estaurant wit hplaers . if a player enters and 5hy are already sitting and eating thedy hav eto get up and leave .
1971,"oh weird why do you think that is ? it seems very silly to ,w"
1972,i don't know but i find it uosetting . it seems completely unreasonable . did you know taht the average gameplay tim ein a gzame is 11 minutes ? !
1973,"i didn't know that , are you going to watch the superbowl tomorrow ? it's always several hours long yret like you said theres only 11 mins of gameplay , that's silly !"
1974,i am but i'm just using it as an excuse to eat bad food a ha . wwre you aware that playere and footbals have trackingc hips in tnem to recorc hteir every moce ?
1975,"no i didn't know that , i hope they don't adopt tbat into regular people to watch our every move , that wold suck !"
1976,me either . i wonder why they don't use that for plays instead of just revie3ws ?
1977,"ya that'ss true , also crazy is that the earnings ofa n engineer over his lifetime is more than the averages nfl player , crazy !"
1978,that is shckin to me . i'm sure they leave with way less medical issues also . i was shockeds when i learend that in the 60's bowlers made more than footgball players !
1979,"that is cazy q i can't believet he highest scoring football game was 2220 , like w0uldn;t you stop once you got to 1000 haha"
1980,i do not understand ho that is even possible . are you familja rwith rb benjarvusg reenellis ?
1981,"no i'm not , what is he faus for ? i don't watch sports persolnally"
1982,he neverf umbled the footbal lonce in his whplec areer which is astonishing .
1983,"that i scrazy i'd give that guy teh ball all the time ! i guess alex smith plays quarterback an dhad a lo of good grsdes on hisa p test , it's kind of like he's wasting his brain talent on football haha"
1984,well he wa sbadly injured nad i doubt he comes ack so i'm sure his intellkigence will get him somewhere esle . i b3lieve he wwa salready working on his mastrer's whend rafted .
1985,"ah interesting i didn't know that , zlso i didn't know that espn won an emmyf or developing the yellow line thar we see in every football gwame on hte first down line"
1986,i can't believe that was so recent . i czan't imagine watching a game withou tthat line .
1987,"no , that was definitely a huge improvement i'm glad they won the emmy !"
1988,do you watch football ?
1989,"i sure do . did you know that women can play on the nf, ?"
1990,"i hneard that , i wonder if there is any chance it will happen soon , what do you think"
1991,i have no idea but it is good that if they qualify they have that option to play
1992,i think therem ay be a kicker in college that hast he chance in a couple years .w e aill have to wait and see . do you have a favorite team ?
1993,i do not but i enjoy watching the games even though there are only 11 minutesz of gameplay altogether
1994,"that is so small of an amount . 7ou figure it would be more , th egames last like 3 hours lol"
1995,i know we are glued 5ot he tv for what feels like forever
1996,"for sure lol . i am an iowa hawkeye fan , do you know htem ?"
1997,i cannot say that i do for sure . did you know that engineers make kore over their lifetim ethan football players ?
1998,they paint their locker rooms pink for the opposing team . pionk has a atural calming look . those engineers probably developed chips that players uxe in their shoulder pads .
1999,yeah they sem to be collecting lots of info with those chips like velcity and rotation an dsuch
2000,"i agree , i bet they g4t so much good data from it . did you know in 1970 topb owlers made more money than nfl players"
2001,wow that is mind blowing . i wonder if they they cna uze that data in any way to make the game safer too
2002,i bet they do . i wish they had chips in fhe helmets to trakc blows to the head and wyat they o . maybe that will be next
2003,"i hope so . do you know that rspn won an emmy once and if so , waht for ?"
2004,"i never heard about htat , what was it for ?"
2005,"it was for the superimposed yellow line , pretty cool"
2006,"wow , that is awesome and i tis so hel;ful . i always thought it was real growung up lol . it was so nice chatting with you !"
2007,same here and hope ou have a great one .
2008,"gou too , enjoy the rest of yourd ngh !"
2009,"hi , do you wathc nfl ?"
2010,"hi , how are you ? sometimes ."
2011,did you know women can play too ?
2012,"i think that there coulkd be women at certain positions , like kicker . women would probably draw a lot of interest , increase the tv audience ."
2013,yeah and make it more interesting as a sport . did you know an average gamr only has 11 minutes of playtime
2014,"on a perminte basis , they make a great wage . did you know that theere is only one lefthanded quarterback in 6he nfl ? kellanm oore . i'ms urprised . i thought there would have been mo0re ,l considering the number of lefty pitcehrs in the mlb ."
2015,yeah exactly . do you know about that weird rule for the new orleans ceerleaders ?
2016,they can't be in the same restaurant as the players . not cool .
2017,"nit cool at wll . worse , they havet o leav if the palyer walk sin mid meal"
2018,"probably not the same for high school football , though . f7nny story : the junipero serra high school had a season in which they didn't win a game or even score a touchdown . nevertehlessw , tehy never started their backup qb , tom brady . and , as a sarcastic comment ,w e a;l know what a loser he was ."
2019,my godnesz their loss . didx you know now they put tracking chips o their padding ?
2020,"that makes sense . helps with strategy . the highest score ever in a football game was in 1916 : georgia tech beat cumberladn 220 . what was teh sprsad on tha tgame , i wonder ."
2021,that is a huge difference . did you know espn won an emmy ?
2022,i heard . for that yellw line . hm . probabl a weak year for awarss .
2023,yeah i think so too . did you know ther eis a player than enver fumbled the football in his career ?
2024,"hard to believe , but i guess it had to happsn eventually . in the6 0s top bowlers made tqice as much as top football stars . still , i wonder how much owlers made overall . was it that much money ?"
2025,"i do not think so , i just think football players were not paid too much tehn"
2026,the coll3ge game seems to be a bit silly in some ways . the univdrsity of iowa tries to use cheesy psychology ont he other team . they pained the visitor's locke rroom completely pink . i wonder whether that works at all . why wouldn't other teams do it as well ?
2027,that is curious . do you know benjarvus greendellis ?
2028,"no , never met the guy ."
2029,he is the only football payer to have never fdumbled in his career
2030,"well , it'sb een fun talking wit hyo8 ! have a great eveninb ! enjoy the football !"
2031,"hi , how are you today ?"
2032,good morninf ! doing well ! are you much of a nlf fan ?
2033,"friend , i tell you i felw like i have had football on the brainf or fth past couple of we4eks ! yrs , i love football . how abot you '"
2034,"yes , i ewnjoy wathcing a good with friends and beers ! who's you5 team ?"
2035,"don't hate me , but my favorite team is the new england patriots !"
2036,"nk hate at all it's pretty impressive what they've done and look to cobtinue to dominate . by proxy , i follow the cadinals , but dont' really consider them my team i just like good game s, teams , players"
2037,"that's cool . i finc most people feel toward sthe patriots like they feel towards trump . it's usually strong feelings of ahte or lov , not6 much in betwene . but , tom brady is the goat !"
2038,tb ahd bilichek are definitely goats ! interesting comparison to trump it's hard not to have an opinion !
2039,"how true . speak8ng of ton , d8id you know his hig school jv vootball coacuh never attempted to play him , even though the team never won a game or even scored a touchdown ?"
2040,that reminds me of the story where micfhael jordan had a hard time makig hi shs varstyg tesm some coaches cannot see greatness if it's staring thme in the face !
2041,"tbat's a facr . i ebt they feel foolish , now ?"
2042,it's amazing how far the nfl and professional sports in geheral have come in terms or popularity and revebue . i've heard that pro bowlers used to make more money than football players !
2043,"that's funny , but i hear the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are more than he lifetime eanrings of an average nfl player ."
2044,"i think teh zverage career in the nfl is 3 season ,f or the average player with a league minimum salary , so a life time career as ane ngineer shouldm ake moren oney !"
2045,"somebody's done their homework and it shows q1 anyway , do you realizet he nfl only has 9on eleft handed quarerback ?"
2046,"inter4sting who is the lefty qb . is tha5 a system thing , are elftoes discouraged from qb at an earky age . i don't see what the big deal is basebaol poitchers can be both . does it really matter that much in football ?"
2047,"kellan moore and to tll you the truth , i don't why there are not more of them ? i would think it's na advantage ."
2048,"right ! anythingt o give a different look , rol lthe other wa6 . once hte ball is in the air , whats the difference . i need answers from the nfl !"
2049,me too !
2050,"congrars on another lombardi trophy ! it ws a strange playoff season , nbut great win for the pats great chatting with you today , really appreciate it !"
2051,"thanks , driend . it wasn ice chatting with you as well . enjoy the rest of your day ."
2052,hello do you like football ?
2053,i do . do you ?
2054,"i like it , i dont watch it to much htough ."
2055,i watch ll the time . my wife is not happy about my sports adiction though . my favorite team 8s the bears . do you have a favorite team ?
2056,i like the 49ers . did you know hte nfl put stracking chips on th ep;ayer sand rootball ?
2057,i put chips i my belly . does that count ?
2058,"lol abzolutely ! i had no ide aalex smith was so smart , he took so many ap tests , he entered a unkiversity as a jounior ."
2059,cnicago hosted the first playoff game in 1932 on an 80 yard dirt filed .
2060,"thats cool . that was a long time ago ,lol"
2061,yeah . did you know there's a 60m stadium in texas ? for high school ?
2062,thats insane . foobtall generates a lot of money in texas though lol not much to do .
2063,i could not imagine being so rich i donated to the constructio of a 60m hs football sfadium . im just trying to keep my lights on .
2064,lol the struggle is real . i cant believe that the average nfl gameh as only 11 min of game play .
2065,i feel like there are too many commercials and replays and measurements .
2066,"yeah , too much fluff . and whats with all the ti eouts anxd fouls and huddles . football an take so much time ."
2067,maybe that's whuy i usually drink too much watching the games ;
2068,"lol i think thats hwy we all drink top much , we are waiting to watch the game lol"
2069,at least i am not the onlu one ! lahtough i am usually the only one watching footabll and drinking .
2070,did you know thea verzage lifetime earning if an engineer is higher than football players and mlb payer s? that is probably not including like sponsorship wnd extras though right ?
2071,agreed . but i also think the liwer end of the spectrum's avg career is like 2 years .
2072,thats col . its been great chatting with you .
2073,do you lik efootball ?
2074,i love it . do youk now what color is the u of ilwa visitor locker room ?
2075,yes it is actually all pink bu ti do not know why
2076,me either . did you know bowlers made more than footballers in the 60s ?
2077,i guess itw as a more pooular sport back in the day
2078,true . do you know what ist he highest score in cololege football ?
2079,"yes it waws 2202 ,d o you know who pl,ahe d?"
2080,yes itw qs georgia tech that beat cumberland in 1916
2081,yeah . did you know that espn won an emmy one ?
2082,yes they won it for the superimposed yellow line
2083,yeah it has made3 game watching so much easier at home
2084,very trud . did you know thazt women can play in the nfl too ?
2085,yes there is no r5ule that says they cannlt if they qualify
2086,yeah . theg ameplay is only 11 minutes anyways
2087,i kbow and yet we are glued to the tv for hours to an end
2088,i know right ? do you know of that rule for sajnts cheerleaders ?
2089,yes they cannot eat in the same place as the players
2090,yes awnd they also have to leave mid meal if they wlak in
2091,yeah too bad it is still around . ro you like brady ?
2092,i sure do . he was a back up qh when he was jn high school
2093,yes and he was never started despite the fact that theyw ere not doing well as a team
2094,their loss really i guess . nice chat today
2095,"hello ! are you much f a football fan ? i don't watch it muc htbh , but i do find a lot of facets of it to be pretty interesting . ."
2096,"good afternoon ! football is not my favorige sporg , but i do enjoy a good gsme ."
2097,"get this , iowa's locier room fot visitors is painted pink . trying to psyche ojut the ohter team , i bet . lol"
2098,that psycho;ogy might b4 a bit antiquated because i thin ka lot of guys don't feel thds ame about pink as they used to in the gooxd old days
2099,"that c0uld bhe true . i'm told that they did an experiment where they put weight lighters in a pink colored gym and found they c9ouldn't lift as much . bt , i ehard about ghat in high school , some twenty plus years ago , so things may be different since then ."
2100,"ijnteresting i have heard aboutt he subconscious afect that color has on mood , never paint a kiychen red , bu ti wasn't sure if that was just an urban myth ?"
2101,"i doh't jnow , i thnk it varies and could be different from person to person . some people , for example find blue to be smoothing and calming , while others think t makes things feel cold ."
2102,"very true and circling bakc to the pink locker room , i'm sure the initial intent was to emasculate hte opponent and beat them before they take the field"
2103,"you know , neatly enough , theres' no rule sin the nfl against women being players . so long as they meet the physical requirements , that is ."
2104,"i've heard that , that they didn't tink they needed the rule because in the old days teh game was much different as were fhe social norms . i know some females have played inc ollege fkotball recently"
2105,"hey , i say if they can do the physicla stutf elt them go at it if they want . although , admittedly if i had a daughter playing football i'd worry about her being tackled . . . . some of those guys are huge ."
2106,"totally agree ic they havse the ability ane the dsire to play in the nfl , awesome . bjt i sure as heck wouldn't want my daughters anywhere near tjat fiedl !"
2107,"even if they were ceherleaders i;d eb concerned . believe it or not , dheerleaders have more injuries than any othrer sport ."
2108,college cheelreaders fo4 sure have a ton of injuries as they do way more of the flipping and gymnastics . i've seen nfl cheerleaders up close and they basically just stadn there for 80 percent of tjhe gamde . . . .
2109,"some tezms have some prettyy strict rules aboutc heerleaders , especially in t3rms of their interaction with the players ."
2110,"i bet back in the day teh distraction proved to be big enough of a problem that thpse nonfraternization ules were impleemnted . today , it's so much of a business that i eoubt it would be much of an issue"
2111,"well , new orleans saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as one of the players . if a player enters and they're already eatint , they have tol eave . how nutty is that ?"
2112,"i bet if the cheerleaders had a union like the players do , they could get that rule thrown out !"
2113,"maybe i dunno . . . here's another weir dtidbit . . .f or as long as nfl games are , ther'es only about eleven minutes of live gaemplay . can you believe it ?"
2114,"i did know tha t, because the nfl network replays games durign the wek and theya r able to trim them down to about a 30 mihn segment , with commercial;s , it is amazing how l8ttle action there is ib an ' action pavked ' game !"
2115,"guess all the set ups , coaches talking , huddles , etc , etc , take up way more time than oud' think !"
2116,"and the incessant tv timeouts ! ! ! after a bad game , i feel like i just wasted 3 hours of my life and it was only really 11 min ! ? ! ? !"
2117,"yeah , it's crazy . did you know they have high tech chips put in the players shouder pads ? keeps track of where they are and whatnot ."
2118,i wish they would put hbtros echips in the ball so they could tellk when it crossest he endzone or out of boumds !
2119,"weell . . supposedly they have one in the ball that tracks its' speed , rotation and location . i don't know why 5they don' tuse that instead of elying on the referees . , guess it's just tradition or something . . . ,"
2120,"you're probably right traditi9n over 6tefchnology q1 hey , i case this ends abruptly it's been great cahtting with you !"
2121,"are you na nfl fa n? if you don't know , there 8s a 17 week regular season ."
2122,"hey ! well , i foklow gamres , but i 3ouldn't say i'm really fan . how about you ?"
2123,did you know a female can play in the nfl because there is no official rule agaist it .
2124,"no , it's absolutely surprise for me"
2125,"laso , in a whole f game , there is only 11 minutes of actual ,ive gameplay ."
2126,"friend of mine told me that . yes , it' sfact"
2127,thay is crazy . the new orlenas saints have a rule were there dbeerleaders can't eat at the swme restauran tas te players .
2128,"it lookds like old tradition , which doesn't maske any sense ."
2129,"an didf the cheerleaders are already there when the playersc ome in , the ceherleaders have to leave ."
2130,dont' you think this rule is ferrible ? what if they wede eatin g?
2131,that sounds sexist to me .s ome more football facts you may not know is that the uniersity of iowa has a completely pink visitors lockwr room .
2132,it's very funny . they want to shock enemies . anyway it's funny
2133,something i could not believe was thaf the top bowlers made twice as much as top ootball players in 1960 .
2134,em too actually . did you know that the highest score ever in a football game was 2220 in 1916 ?
2135,"no , that is a lot of points . i did kno wthat rb benjarvus grewnellis , who play6ed for the patiots never had af umble ."
2136,"me too . it's even difficutl to guess . also i'm surprised htat the average lifetime earnngs of an engineer is hivher than average lifetime earnings o an nfl playder . i was sure they make a ,ot ."
2137,i just can't believe that . did you know tom brady was a backup quarterback i nhigh school .
2138,i guess my dad knows it . he knows about tom brady quite a lot .
2139,"he was either bad or the coach was an idiot . but evsn though his team was having a historicaly abd season , he never glt a chance to statt ."
2140,i agreed . he didn't show his best . an6way it is sport . you never know . . .
2141,i also know that there is only one left handed quarterback in teh nfl . it is kellna moore .
2142,"yes , i know . i don't know a lot of such facts , but somehow i've heard about it ."
2143,"wekll , have a great day ."
2144,"thanks , myf riend ! have a good one !"
2145,happy new year .
2146,i didn't find this article very interesting . how about you ?
2147,yeah i'm not very interested in football so it took me a while to get througnh . i rid think it was a little crazy that the nfl use stracking chips on hteir plzyers and equipment though
2148,yeah some of the facts caught me of gua5d too . like that fact tyhat there is no written rule against femald players .
2149,right ? i would lov eto see a female in the nfl . i also couldn't believe that the american flags they use weight 1100 like i know tehy'rs big but its hars to imagine a flag weighing that much haha
2150,i do not understandt he rule about new orleans saint players and cheerleaderd .
2151,"i con't remember teading bout that just now in my article ,b ut it sounds familiar . it has something to do with rthem not being able to hang out right ? like they can't go to the same parties or other places at the same time , yeah ?"
2152,"yeah eve nif a cheerleadef is eating a ta restwaurant and ann fl player cokes in to dine at the rstaurant , any nfl player , they are required to lesave . wow"
2153,"is it always the cheerleaders that have to leave ? like if she's already there and a playe rwlaks in , she has to be the one ro go ? thats really strange"
2154,yeah that's what it says . no fratednization at all .
2155,"tha'ts . . . really weird . s;eaing of weird , i guess there is a high school stadium in texas that ckst 60 million to build and seats 18 , 000 people who knew people cared that muhc aboyt high school fooyball ? !"
2156,"oh sure , in some parts of texas there is nohting else to do for a hundred miels at least ; for some small towns , high school football is all the excitement tey get ."
2157,"yeau that makrs sense . i guess if i had nothing else , i might have to turn to football for entertainment haha . did you read about matt patrici a? apparently he was a rocket scientists ebfore his nfl coaching job ."
2158,i think w ehuave diffefrent facts .b ut that is inte5reing . one of mine is that the university of iowa's visitor .locker roomf or footabll is painted completley lin . hilarious !
2159,"hah that is acrually pretty funny ! i wonder if its effective in throwoing off the opposing tema a bit . i read that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterbaci in the nfl no trthe most onteresying fact , but kind of surprising . i didn't think being lefthnaded was that uncommon . i wonder how many lefth sanded ones they'v ehad overall ?"
2160,that is interesting . i thought tehre would have been more ss well . just like in baseball .
2161,"is being lefthanded unusual in baseball too ? or are you saying its not uncommon ? speaking of baseball , i guess russell wilson is stil under an mlb contract ? i didn't know that was possible !"
2162,"lol all these crazy fun facts . iw as ssaying it is way more common in baseball , to see both left and right handed pi5tchers ."
2163,right that's hwat i though t! i fee like these are good for potential trivia questions haha like i read that snoop dogg wrote z fight song for his son's high school team . i wonderw hat that sounds like haah
2164,yeah adn that the highest football score ever was in 1916 222 0
2165,222 ? tahts insane . i wonder how long that game lasted ?
2166,rihgt ?
2167,much of a football fan ? ibterested i9n redskines or buccaneers ?
2168,only if they have a female player on theitr teams .
2169,"we may be out of luck on that one . i lived in dc for a number of year , so some would thin i have ab intgerest in dc winning ."
2170,"i'm a enw orleans natice , and won't support the saints , unmtil they get rid of that archaic rule regarding cheerladers being in the sam restaurants as the players ."
2171,"agreed , i real;ly don't likre the whole cheerleaddr hting . i have a young daughter and woule hate for her to want to be a cheerleader ."
2172,"mine doesn't hceer , as i don't like the cultue . my son's girlfriend plays football fort heir school , she's their kicker . i'm surprised no nfl team has a woman kicke5 ."
2173,"qell there is no rule against it . i'm sure there would be a lot of duss in the media for a few weeks , and then once she played it would be forgotten . i knkw in uk soccer they have womrn referees , once they started doing it everyone got over it ."
2174,do they also have track8ng chips in their bls over there or
2175,"probably , i know most big splprts leagjes track just about ever7ything the players do , always looking for that edge ."
2176,"thats insane . i think it's invasive , and wouldn't want a tracker in my shoulder pads , ir i were a player ."
2177,"i think the compensation football players get now would allow me to get over it . although i think we assume most players are set for life after a career , it might not be true ."
2178,"maybe . i still csan?t eblieve espn won an emmy for that superimposed yellow line . must have been a bad year , if they won for that ."
2179,"i suppose if you are really into the game it matters to you , remembering a numbrr in your head can be difficult . i remember my son wondering howt he linem oved on the pitch when he was really young ."
2180,it's ijnteresting that baker mayfield thought avout becoming a pro gamer . i wonder how that wo8ld have worked out fpr him .
2181,"i've eben hearing more and more about pro gaming , apparehtly there is money ih in now . colleges have started offering scholzrships fore sport league playerw . not sure how i feel abot 6hat , i guess it's safer than football ."
2182,"he is a halo 3 guru , i guess . if they arw a tthat level , tehn they prlbably make more tahn what a scholarhsip is worth . i know some of the pros make millions ."
2183,"i wonde rhow long a pro gamer career lasts ? if it's nkot longe than a football players they will run into the same issue where a regualr career pays more than a short sports career ,"
2184,"9 suppose asl ong as thei4 reflexes hold out . it's funny , prob o3lers used to make more than pro football players ."
2185,"i thik a pro bowling career might last a little longer , doesn't seem much chance of injury . espn needs to come up with an innovation for bolwing , its very repetitive ."
2186,th same could be said for footall .
2187,"guess you have a point , i still don't undersand how you ca nturn 11 minutes of play into three hou7rs of tv . it's been good chattijg to you ."
2188,"i don't understand that either , any more than i udnderstand why there is only one left handed quarterback . it's been fun , have a g9od one ."
2189,"have a goodd ay , goodbye ."

2206,"didn't it cost6 0 million dollars ? that is insane , i beg the teachers are sgill underpaid there too !"
2207,"yup ! that's th eone ! so much mony is spent on fkotball ! did you know that those humongous american flags at football s6tadiums cost 50 , 000 to make ! ?"
2208,"it is cool to see bu tthat is a lot of money ! i hope it goes to a good cause ! anyways , grea tchat have an awesome day 1q"
2209,"indeed ! anx those flags weibn 1 , 100 pounds ! go bi gorg o home ,a s they say6 ! good bye !"

2215,i know . in the 1960's top bowlees made twice as much as top football wtars !
2216,wow that shocked me . . . nothing like that today did you knpw trhee football coaches are the highest paid employees of the us defense departmnet !
2217,that's incredible ! the highest score ever in a football game is when greorgia tech beat cumberland 2220 !

2219,i rdidn't . tat' sneat ! espn wob an emmy for creating the supeeimposed yellow first down line on tv .
2220,"i think that is cool ! technology has allowed for a way mo4e exciting game , like hte tracking chips !"
2221,i agree ! baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a full tijme competitive gamingc areer .
2222,"wow , i wouldj't eant a change like that . . did you kow there re many other types of footfball like soccer , rugby gaelic footbzll ! !"
2223,yes i've seen them . i had af riend ghat was i nrugby club years and years ago .
2224,"cool i love socce r, follow the fc barcelona . . . but do not know anythging about australian football !"
2225,that'xs funny . tha5t same friend was from england and was bkig on mancjester united . the averag4 nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay . seems crzy to pay all that money for a ticket when looked at from that perspective .
2226,"seems like it but the reality is thatt he whle show if worth it and with tbe tracking chip you get info like the ball speed , tye bslocity and that adds to the averag4e 11 m9inte hahaha"
2227,lol the average lifetime earnings of an enginewer i shigher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl layer and an average mlb player .
2228,oh wow . but i think is way more fun to play foothall . . . but i think the engineer has to work many more years . . have you seen the super super big flags at the football stadiums
2229,i have seen them ! htosef lags are huge !
2230,"they weight more that 1000 pounds and cost about 50 , 000 wow q"

2241,sorry i was just telling you more anout the rield whether first playoff game sheld . i don't know the highest score ever . wgat was it ?
2242,tha'ts okay . it was a game between georgia tech crushin gumberland 2120 ij 1916 .
2243,holy cow how doest hate ven happen ? i bet matt patricia would never let that happen . he is the only rocket scientist coaching in the nfl .
2244,yes i heard that matt patricia is a rocket scientist aw hile back in my local news and whnw he was our defensive coordinator under bill belichickm .
2245,"oh wow . he graduated from a school whose fight somg includes sin , cosine , and tangent lol ."
2246,i didn't know this . that is very interesting . matt patricia is a really smart guy and i think he will be reat as a lions head coach .
2247,"yes i agree with 6ou . do you like watchign high school football ? it is hufe in texa , they hace a stadium that cost 60 million to build ."
2248,i don't really watch high school football these day but that is sa lot of money to buid a high school stadium .
2249,"yes it is ; it seats 18 , 000 people ."
2250,nice . did you know that alex smith received his achelor's degree in just a couple of years ?
2251,"that is amazing he sounds so smart . speaking of quarterback s, russel wilso nis stil; udner a maqjorleague baseball contract . it was nice speaking with you today ."
2252,i didn't know thisa bout russel wilsojn . it was fantastc chatting with you today as well . i hope you have a great day ! ! !
2253,you too ! have a good one !
2254,"i don't know much about football , but apparently adria bpeterson js a new star omn the redskins team ;"
2255,"he seems to have done well , zlex smith struggled in that game . hw is typically on ;oint , to 3hat i know ,"
2256,"i's pdetty amazing how he got a shot , seeing as he wasn't in the train8ng camp , it sounds like he has a lot o fstamina ."
2257,he is ready and willing to do qhat ever gruden will give him . definitely a hard worker .
2258,"i think nfl players maks a lot of money these days , so i bet he's glad to be on a teama gain . however , i didn't know that bowlers in 1960 made more htan football star s."
2259,"that is iinda crazy , i wonder h9w much taht pay was , and what the gap is today ."
2260,"it's probably nota s much as it was in 1960 twice as much , wow . that makes me want to take up biowling ! i think the game peterson played wasn't a very clear win , only a few scotes . tehre was one game in 1916 where the final score was 2220 . i didn't know the game coulc go that high !"
2261,"neitner did i . that is a pretty largeg ap . in most games there is only 11 minutes of live game play anyway , that game must have had a lot mor e."
2262,"yeah . id idnt' rezlize it was only around 11 minutes of actual play . thinking about it , though , i guess they time all the huddles adn positioning . i didn't know teh circular huddle eas created by a deaf quarterback . i thougth that beganw ith the gane so they could apl hear each other ."
2263,"it is amazing that what they come up with , the huddle has become iconic ."
2264,yes it has become icomic . 5hi speterson is called a running badl . is that the guy who tries to throw it to the quarterback or tries to catch the ball ?
2265,he is the guy that the quarterback hands the ball off to .
2266,"oh ok . i knew the quarterabck was an important guy for offense , but peterson's position sounded important too . i think football plpayers have a lot of pressure to o well . appaqrently the nfl uses chips to track lots of stats about tehm . i wonder if that affects their pay ."
2267,"im not sure , but i know they do use the dzata from the chips o make play safer for them and make their pads better ."
2268,that's a good thing . i thino tey can easily get injured without pads . i th8ink padding is morel ike teh smerican kind okf footblal . i've zeen some clips of rugby played without pads . that looks pretty rough .
2269,"yeah , gaelic football is tbe same way , im not sure how it wokras but it isnt for the weak ."
2270,"i personally like the european type of football , also called soccer . i like the strategy and skill . iv'e been to zan international soccer game bwfore , it was really awesome to watc h."
2271,me too . i always played growing up . i loved watching the world cup this past smmer .
2272,"i hafen't watched sports lately . it's funny howt hings change , like how tom brzdyb ecme a s8uper bowl champ , but in high school they didnt' even give him a chance ."
2273,"i know , ib et they feel a little stupid now seeing what he ha sbecome ."
2274,"yes i yhink so . i wonder if peterson wants to win sudh an award before he has to retire . hopefully the redskins will do better than the game against the rboncos , so he has a chance to prove himself ."
2275,"i knowh e has become a more dominant orce ash e gains experience . anyway , nice chat ! have a good night ."
2276,i was just reading about the nfl . are you a football fan ?
2277,"i love football , go detroit lions ! ! hat about you ?"
2278,"i am a vikings fan , big time . i was reading abou nick foles' up and down career . the eagles sure killed my vikes n tyhe playoffs last yrar !"
2279,"it will be interesting to see how foles does from here on out , must be irritating for eagles fans never knowing !"
2280,"yes . i was surprised that the patriots lost tge super bowl last year . did you know that when tb was a qn in high school as a backup , they never played him on the jv team when they were having a really bad season . funny !"
2281,"that is funny , i don't care for patriots but can't help but like brady , a michigan man go blue ! !"
2282,exactly . you cannot fault his tremednous commitment to the gaem . i think a beas o rpatriots superbowl would be fun again .
2283,"i've read that snoop dogg wrote a fi9ght song fo rhis son's football team in high school , that could be interesting !"
2284,yes . that is probwably a pretty vivid and inspirign song !
2285,i was also intefest3ed to read about the lions' cach is a rocket scientist ! have you seen him durig a game ?s o dough looking
2286,"matt parricia ? he is super smart ! swo is alex msith , one of my favorite qb's . he got a bachelor's degree in 2 years dn a maste4r's soon after ."
2287,"that is good ti hear , some of those nfl players don't seem too intelligent , and can be so cocky and"
2288,"i agree . here's a piece of football trivia . the huddle was created ebcause of a deaf 2b , so that the otber team could not read his hand signals . intyeresting . . ."
2289,oh how cool is that ! also interesting i sthat tehy embed chip in the shoupd 0ads to track the playerxs every move
2290,i had heard that somewehre . plus all of the wondedrful new technology in the helmets to help with the concussion problem .
2291,yes that i sa scary thing !
2292,"seems to be geting worse , despite the tech advances . p.ayers mus tbe stronger , bigger and faster ?"
2293,"definitely , so many people can be so competitive it gets scary ."
2294,yes . hey do you know th ehighdst score ever in a football game ? you'll never gu4ess !
2295,"i have no idea , but would guesxs maybe 77 ?"
2296,"good try ! in 1916 , it was 220 . georgia tech defeated cumberland . wow !"
2297,"holy coq that is a huge score , nad cumber;and didn' teven make i5 on the board !"
2298,awgul ! it was great chatting with you . thanks . go lions and bikes !
2299,are you a football fan ? do you have a favori6e team ?
2300,i like th3e steelers . how bout you .
2301,i'm a steelers fan too ! i ;liver ight on the ohio or pa line . did you know that tghere is only 1 left handed qb in the fl kelalm moore .
2302,i did know thst . you would think there woud bem ore .
2303,i know . what do you thin kof th enfl 8sing trackinh chips in the playhers shoulders and in the footballs ?
2304,i think its an amazing technology . the things they can do these days .
2305,i know . i just wonder though what exactly those chips do . liek . . . could they read where other chipsaw re on the field ? . . and if so . . . cou;ld a chip in the shoulder pad sof a wide receiver be programmed to the chip that's in the football making the football come to the receiver's chip location ?
2306,tat's ibteresting to think about . i bet belihvek hasa lready checked into that .
2307,hahaha an average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay7 . crazy whej they make it stretch out to over 3 hours .
2308,i know right . they get all that moneyh for 11 minutes worth of entertainment .
2309,it pays to be an engibeer as thekr lifetime earnings are higher than that of the lifetime earninys of an average nfl or mlb playe r.
2310,yeah but i think it would be a lot more fun to play football for a living .
2311,i'm with you there ! lol in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars .
2312,ki think the players union has rectified that situation .
2313,yes ! lol i 3onde rwhy the univeraity of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink ? probably to mess with the team . lol
2314,to mess with the visiting team . do you think it worked .
2315,i don't think so . lol how about the highest scoring game ever when georgia tech beat cumberland in 1916 by a score of 2220 !
2316,thy 2er ejus rubbing i in that last 200 points huh .
2317,lo lpoor cumberland . did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf qb so the oher team couldn't steal his han dsignals ?
2318,yeah and the huddle has become so engrained into footabll . its hard to think of the gzame without it .
2319,i know right ? ikt was fun fhatting wiht you !
2320,hoi . do you lik the nfl nad the ravens ?
2321,i like the nfl . not so much the ravens .
2322,"same here . i guess lamar jackson is back , or ha sbeen back , . . . so many injuries in the nfl ."
2323,im a steelers fan and we play thme twice a year . i promise you im not worried about lamar jackson .
2324,ha . i see . . . i'm a chidfs fa nd i'm not losing any sleepl . i think the ravens would do better if they could the players out of jail . i didn't know teh saints ha dan i1 record .
2325,jackson can run hbut he cant throw at all . you all got a pretty good qb up ther in kc tho
2326,"yeah , mahomes is a great surprise . if he stays healthy , he'll give brady a run for his money , career statswise ."
2327,brady will b out in the next few years . i would say staying hesalthy an dnot falling off oike a lot of guys do after one good year is his main concern s.
2328,"yes , i agree . . . maybe he',l be like luck and avoid those sacks . hooe so , i'd hate to see him go and he's so young ."
2329,tob e honest the chiefs scare me more than the patriots do a tthis poitn .
2330,"yeah , i was surprise to see that rams come out on top . i thinik the pats are going downhill ."
2331,i sure hope so . im sick of them . lo l. did you know tht there is a rocket scientist coaching in teh nfl .
2332,i did not . is he doign well ? i can't believe taht or that thbere is only 11 average minutes of gameplay in an nfl game .
2333,his nam eis mat patrecia . im nots ure wh0 he coaches .
2334,i'm not sure those are transferable talents . . . nor do i thin kpainting a visitors locker rom pink is going to do anythig at the u . of iowa .
2335,yeha i dont see that doing much . it would make ag ood team laugh and who carews what it does to a bad team . lol .
2336,i played in hs and on away games we used the gilrs lockr rooms . it had no effedt although i did break a barry manilow album after a loss . i regret that . . . we did have a cicular huddle thank to a deaf qb of hyesteryear .
2337,that huddle ha grown into a majmor part of the game .
2338,yeah . . . i don't remmeber alex smith being so smart or being a 1st round draft pick . . .
2339,i think he was drafted by the patriots wastnh e . i didnt think ye was a first roundere either .
2340,this article i read says je was a f9irst rounder in 2005 doesn't say to whom . thanks for the chat and good luck ti the steelers .
2341,yavse a good one .
2342,hello are you familiar with football ?
2343,yes m id o . i'm amd that new orlean saitns cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player ; they have to leave if a player comes in to the sqam erdstaurant . it's iscrimination .
2344,i agree euch old fashion rules are a shame . at least the nfl has no written rule against female players
2345,that'z good . when do you think we will see femald players ?
2346,"that i am not sure . evnet hough an average game only has 11 minutes of rea lgameplay , footbsll is still among the most dangerous eports so the requirements are quit3 up there ss well"
2347,"i think you ar3 right . apparently , nfl uses track9ng chips to keep track playrrs' every move on the field ."
2348,it must be for more data . it is hard to catch all the act9on in those few minutes . that why espn won an emmy for the yellow tirst down lihe because it helps digest teh information much easily
2349,i'm sure coaches uset he data from these chips to makw various trategy in addition to watching video replays .
2350,i wonder if he nfl provides the data to individual coaches
2351,i don't know . thank you for telling me that edspn won an emmy for the dreation of the yellow firstd own line . it's an interesting fact .
2352,"do you follow teams , positins , or players ?"
2353,i used to like 49ers since i lived in sf for3 0 years but now i fo.low the patriots .
2354,i used to follow green ellis on the patriots since hes till has never fumbled in his entire career
2355,"it was amazing that ellis has never fumbled the football in hi snf career , how about brady ?"
2356,"well he is better knowna s an amazing quarterback , having won 4 superb owls . he probably is'gt in a position to fumble balls , bur he sure can throw"
2357,do you know that kellan moors is the omly left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
2358,yes . it is definitely impressive since ebing left handed i more a disadvantage than advantagfe in football unlike in other sports
2359,do yout hink brady is the besft qb in the entire history of nfl ?
2360,"iven his performance , despite not veing given the chance in hjghschool , i think he progably is the gest qb in history"
2361,you are probably right . no one ha won many superbowl championship like he did . 5 tims ?
2362,"somerthing like that . anyway , i enhoyed our pleasant chat ."
2363,do you watcn football ?
2364,yes . i watch it all season long ande ven have been watching fthe alliance league .
2365,i watch it too . did you kinow kellan moore is the only lefty ?
2366,i didn't know that . come to think of it i can't recall any lefties . florjer patriots running back benjarvuhs greenellis never fumbed the bwll onced uring his career . impressive .
2367,"interesting , was he the best running back then ?"
2368,i would say that would go to jim brown . esepn won an emy award of creating the superimp0sed first down line . nice .
2369,that is probably worth it . that line is super cool .
2370,i agree . int he 1960s top bowlers mad etwo timesa s muc has the top football stars of that era .
2371,"wow ! that is prett7 ciol , gives me hope then !"
2372,lol do you know whatt he highest scoree ver was for a foob5all game at the college level ?
2373,"no , what was it ?"
2374,2220 ! georgia tech beat cumberland in 1916 .
2375,wo w! that is a lot . did you know that university of iowa paints their guest locker room pink ?
2376,lolk that's funny ! they must do thay to get in th e3hads of who they are playing .
2377,"i think so , but jonestly you have to wonder if it just makes the other team angry ."
2378,i don't think they probably really care . do yku know who alex smith is ?
2379,"notr eally , is he a football player ?"
2380,yes . he's a qb . he was the first pick in the 2005 draft by the 49er's . what's impressive about him is hta6 he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 2 years !
2381,interesting . is he left hnaded too ?
2382,no . he's a righty . i'm surprised that there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay per an average nfl game .
2383,"that figures , every tkme i watch a game it is people standing around on the sideline s."
2384,"hell , do you know much about quarterbacks ?"
2385,"i do ! i know that kellan moore is the only ,eft handed qb in the nfl ."
2386,that's interesting . what about vick ?
2387,"he's retired . b8t , he'sc oaching one of yte teams in the new american alliacbne of football league .d o youh ave a favofrite qb ? mine is baker mayfield ."
2388,i did not knmow that . i would say mahomes i smy favorite right no w. i also like andy dalton .
2389,mahoems j sgood nad i like dlaton . eb curious to see what mahomes does next year . sde if teams can adjust to him . baker mayfield once cobidered quitting football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career . yikes ! that sounds too risky .
2390,i agree . did you know alex smith took eo many ap classes in high school rhat he was a junior whern he entered college ?
2391,i didn't know that . that's pretty impreasive ! the circular huddle wasc reated by a deaf qwb named paul hubbard so the other team could not read hi hand signals .
2392,htats' pretty interesting . i haf no idea . do you like the nfl ing eneral ?
2393,i do . i've been an nfl fan my whole life . probably more so though before big money chagned the game .
2394,me too ; did y9u know the fnl has no written rule aga9nst females plsying in the league ?
2395,i didk now thatr . i wonder i fwe'll see 0ne soon . maybe a kicker ?
2396,i bet itw ill be a kicoer too .
2397,did you know that there is only 11 minutes of olive gameplay per game ?
2398,"i did not know thqt , but that is pretty amazing . i would have never guessed that ."
2399,short time considerign they stretch out a gae to 3 hours . lol what do you think of the tracking chips they put in the playerss houlder pads and footballs to track data ?
2400,"i agree . yes , i heard they do that to track rotation , ball speed , location , and velofity ."
2401,i've wondered if they could be attracted to o9ther chips ? like would the chips in the balls be prkgrammed t6o be attracted to hte chips in the wide receivers shoulder pads ?
2402,"'m not too sure how that works , but curious to know ."
2403,the highest scoring foptball game ever was 2220 when georgi tech beat cumberland in 10916 . hwat a blowout !
2404,it was good talkinh to you !
2405,"hi , do you like the nfl ?"
2406,it's pretty entertainng .? can you believe the very first playoff game was in 1932 ?
2407,that was a long time agi !lp ike when georgia tech beat cumberland !
2408,"yeah k, on an 80yard long dirt field that was thje home of an nhl team !"
2409,"w2ait , what ? whay was the field ? the cumberland game ? tell me more !"
2410,tfhe field of tehf irst playoff game in 1932 was actually on a dirt field ineide the chicago stadium which waa hwere the blackhawks played their games at the tie .
2411,that's crazy ! im ih chcago and i did not know that ! i did love the old stadium though !
2412,nice . did you know there was a football coach in the nfl who is also literally a rocket scientist ?
2413,i did ! but i am also a huge football junkie . matt patricia ! he is thel ions head coach .
2414,tha'ts cool . the lions have a pretty good quarterback .
2415,"i agree . although he is long in the tooth . as a bears fan , i hopew they do poorly !"
2416,i can't believe there is only one lefthanded quarterback in hte league .
2417,is it byran leftwich ?
2418,"no , it's kellan moore ."
2419,"wow , i thought it weas byron leftwich . eh was good too !d o you have a favorite nfl team ?"
2420,"i don't , i' mmore of a baseball fan . though russell wilson plagys both !"
2421,i love baseball too . i am a cubs fam though . big fan . watching mb ntwork now !
2422,"cool . yea h, wilson is technically still under an mlb contract even though he hasn't played since 2011 ."
2423,he has been to a few spring trainings though . rnagers an yankees .
2424,"yeah , the rangers traded hi mto the yankees last year ."
2425,nice catting with you !
2426,"tyou , too ! have a gpod 9en !"
2427,"hello , did you happen to watc the superbowl yesterday ?"
2428,ye si did . did you ?
2429,"i dicd , i thought it was a good game , both teams had strong defenses i think tom brady did a good job ecen though he finished as the third most valuable qb"
2430,both defneses did play good . who were the two qbs more valuable than tom brady ?
2431,im not sure but if had to gues i would say aaron roders and drew brees .
2432,i see . are you talking baout the super bowl or teh entire seasom ?
2433,"im talking about the entire season , i think he might go up to second or first witn his performance last ight l, he threw a great 0aes fo4 hte only touchdown"
2434,but there were not passing touch downs last night .
2435,"i kno w, but hte pass tha twas almost a gouchdown , tahts the one im refering to ."
2436,i see . yes htat was a very god pass . not many qbs could make that throw .
2437,"yeah , too bad it wasnt a touchdown though , so clos ejust a few more yards , so what is your favorite nfl team ?"
2438,the dallas cowboys . i've been watchibg thems ince i was a little kie . how baout you ?
2439,"my favorite team is the patriots so i had a pretty good time lazdst night , how did the cowboys do this season ?"
2440,that's awesome . it's always nice whn your favorite team wins the championship . the cowboys won their division but lost in the 2nd round oft he playoffs this year .
2441,"thats too bad , maybe next year theyw ill make it , you know the sints have thi sunfair rulre and if a cheerleader is a ta restaurant and a player goes to the sae places he must then leave"
2442,really ? that's a pretty crazy rul ethat i have never har dof . did you also know that brad johnzon is thye only qb toe ver throw touchdown pass to imself ?
2443,"how is that possible lol , i might have to look for tha tstrange fact in youthbe later , i wonder how the pass went"
2444,i twas near the goal line and when he threw the bal it was defledted by a lineman but went right back to him . h ecaught it and ran it in . was pretty crqzy .
2445,"it must have bene great and really sual since h eis the obl one to have done that , i dont know were the fact of the 11 minutes of gameplay comesf rom , it sure seems like a game is a lot longer and the clock is always paused ."
2446,yeah it would seme like a lot longer than 11 minute sto me as well .
2447,"yeah , football sure is a beautifull game to bad the season is now over ."
2448,do you follow football much ?
2449,"hello there i do watch ig , how about you ?"
2450,i lovew atching it . do you watch both college and nfl ? who are your teams ?
2451,"i follow the packers , how about you ?"
2452,"me too , i love aaron rodgers . i am am iowah awkeye fan , did you ear that they paint their locker room for the othe4r team pi9nk"
2453,"i heard about that , that is too funny , and i guess it's proven 5o help the other team relax ."
2454,"right , i thinmk it has worked , htey have beat quality teams at home . did y0u know there is no rule against females playing in the league"
2455,"i think i hseard that , i think it would be vry cool 5to see a femape player make a roster and play ."
2456,"right , i heard there may be a female kicker going to play college football simewhere , that wou,d be neat"
2457,"yeah its ure would be , even if it was just kicker to start ."
2458,"for sure , that would open up a lot of opportunitiexs . did you hear about the saints cheerleader rule ?"
2459,"i think so , the one where they wud have to leave a place if members o fthe team show ?"
2460,"yea that is pretty sexist in my opinion . that makes the feamle potential in the nfl take a step bzck , my opinion"
2461,"yeah i wouyld have to agre4 with you there , seems dumb to me to be honest ."
2462,"for sure i agree , do you watch college"
2463,"yeah i watch some college but notv ery closely , always seems like the same schools , how about you ?"
2464,"sqme , just the hawkeyes mostly . did you har agout the game in 1916 that ended 2220"
2465,i heard about that wow ! i wonder how mnay of the fans of the opposing team were still in the stnadsa t the end ?
2466,i wonder i fthy still had a football program sfter that lol ! i would have quit once the scode got to be like 1000
2467,"yeah they just cancel the whole program lol , and how cdie they even szcore that many ? you can't evwn score that much in tecmo super bowl ."
2468,"right lll , that is so crazy . i feel there should habe veen a mercy rule created after that game lol . it was very nic4 chatting witb you !"
2469,"hi , i read somewhere that the average nfl game has only 11 minute sof actual hame p.ay , that's hard to beslieve isn't it ?"
2470,"yes , anyone who has ever tuned into an nfl broadcast knows that plenty of air time is spent showing players huddling , coaches yelling , and fans cheering"
2471,"yeah , it seemzs like alot of wasted time ."
2472,i do not like that
2473,"ok , when do you think the nfl will get its first female player ?"
2474,i do not know that . it would be nice if it happened .
2475,"i don't underst5and , but i wuld think they are people sitting around ad betting on the date the first woman player will be admitted to the nfl ."
2476,sorry i do not know that details .
2477,"ok , that's fine . do you know taht tye uiversity of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink ?"
2478,"yes i think , college football . . . visiting locker rooms ar3 often cramped places that aren't meant to b e. for ah ome team's opponents , bur the ahwkeyes take things up a notch"
2479,i'd say so too . do you know nfl pyers have tracking hcips mebedded int heir shoulder pads to record their every move on the field ?
2480,"yes i know little bit , sep 7 , 2017 last season , zebra technologies broughtn extgen stats to the nfl by implementing their rfid chips in nfl players' pads to track speed ,"
2481,"tghat's cool , i wonder who's the fastest player ?"
2482,"i think , ten runnign backs were faser , qnd wide receiver john ross set the combine record at 4 . 22 . but it's fournette , the 240pound bruiser"
2483,does fournette play for the jacksonville jaguars ?
2484,sorry i don' tonow that details please explain .
2485,iw as just wondering what fnl team he played for . what is your favorite football team ?
2486,"i like , the green bay packers are a professjional american footbzl lteam based in green bay , wisconsin ."
2487,"oh cool , tue packsrs are good . i klike the dallas cow3boys , america's team ."
2488,"okay , that nice . whic hplayer you mostly like ?"
2489,i like the vreat tom brady . it's been nice talking with you .
2490,"hello , do you know much about the quarterback position ?"

2492,that's interesting . i did not know that . i know vick was a lefty .
2493,and the great steve young haha . can you beoieve bowlers once earned more m9oney than footbal lplayers ?
2494,i find that harde to believd . bowling has really gone downhill since then .
2495,"it really has , or has football gone up ?"
2496,maybe just football has gone up . bakr mayfield once thought about quitting footabll to pursue a career in profesional gaming .
2497,"i wonde rif he is still gyreat at halo 3 ? i'm surprised alex smith is still playing , given he's basically a genius !"
2498,i have no idea if he is . that's pretty amazing about alex smith . he must be very smart .
2499,"oh for sure . i love watching football games , but hate that ther eis only 11 minutes of actual live gamep,ay ."
2500,that;s very surprising . did youk no wthe nfl has no written rule against women laying ?
2501,"i didn't know taht , i wodner if any hafe tried out for teams ! i hate that the new orleans saints kick cheerleaders out of restaurants if a player comes in though !"
2502,i thinkm any teams uhave rules about plyers interacting with cheerleaders .
2503,maybe it is needed f rthe players ? could you imagine being at that college game where the score was 2220 ?
2504,i can't imagine losing by that much . i would be very sa d.
2505,i think the wholet eam would just quit after that haha . that was in 1916 though sl it might have gotten better !
2506,iowa painted their opposinjg team locker room pink .
2507,"i thought that was zlways 8nteresting , i wodner if it actually did affect oither teams ?"
2508,not too sure . i d9n'r see how that would really work all that well .
2509,maybe they shodl get an emmy like espn did for their yellow line during gamepaly ?
2510,"that'z oretty awesome . well , it was really good chatting with you today ."
2511,do you know wha twdc stand for ?
2512,i have no idea is ita mericanf ootball champions ?

2514,"haahahaasaa , ok thats awesome i hope so too ,w hy is it called footballa nyways ? they play it with their hands . i dont get it some times ."
2515,"yes , football should be f9 rsoccer games snce soccer players play using their feet ."
2516,"you got that right lol , i feel the sam eway too , i love soccer , and i love watching the players rbawl in american football though , so talente di jyst hope no one dies in the field one day they are taented and strong though , did you know that kellanm oore is the only left handed qb in the nfl ? i guess rigut hnaded peopld are just more fit to be bqas ."
2517,i did not know that . are you watching foobtlal games this season ?
2518,"o in perticular i am forced to follow them htouhgh because of my job , i love talking about sorta with my clients"
2519,peoplet alk abou tsports duringb usiness coverations but we need to avoid talking about polifics . how do teams choose quaterbacks ? is it like choosing learders in a company ?
2520,"exactly i agree with yo0u , wjt hsports everyghing is into play though including race , i dont know how they choose the qb , butf i know a fac that only 2 black qbs have won the super bowl"
2521,"thanks for the info . by the way , since we talked about i earlier , afc stads for aemrican fooyball confernce , i just did soem research while talking to you ."
2522,"ohhh lol we were not so off then igs close to american footballc onfrence , they have come from far though l, for example i read spmewhere thatt he first nfl play offg ame was played on a dirt field in chicago , but now look how fancy the fields ar etoo much money lol , do you think players are overpaid ?"
2523,i just found out that fnl consists of nfc and afc
2524,"ohhh wow , now i know what nfl and afcd are so what is nfc then ?"
2525,ncf cstands for ati8onal football cofnernce .
2526,"wow to complicate , i know thogh thar nlf id one o fthe 4 majoy pro sports leagues in north merica . i think thats pretty blss , and one thing i like is that they play football here in amrrica and ig makese nough money to get teh robert kerqfts rich literally the nfl does not have to ssell the sport anywhere else if it does not wwnt to ."
2527,nfl owners make so much money i do not mind if the players are overpaid becwause they are foing dang3rous jobs . do you know that there is no rule against female players ?
2528,"i ehar you my friend they hage so muchm oney if they can pay the athlets that much , lol how much do you think they keep ? ? wait what do you mean no ruela gainst female players ? you mea nthe can play on a mal eteam ?"
2529,as long as they meet eligibjility requirmeents .
2530,"ohhh wow ! those guys are giants literally , but surprisingly young too , tom brady is getting too old for 5hem i think that swhy patriots are not doing very good this year , do you believe women should play on an nfl team ?"

2535,"no way , hate them . what about demarcux lawrence not getting the pr4aise like he should ? he is a great pass rusher !"
2536,"i heard that , i thjink he wil get tst big contract though . did you know the saints cheerleaders n4ed to leave a restaurant if the p;ayers come , kind of sexist i think !"
2537,"yeah , that would suck to be them . teh cheerleadrrs al4ead don't get paid . i would be so embarrassed ."
2538,"for sure , you know who does get paid well , engineers . they make more than nfl players over their lifetime"
2539,"ewha tq thats xcrazy and those quarterback better sta6 in school and not rely on their bodies . alex smith is very smart , ya know ?"
2540,i hear that and a great player . didn' the get his degree super early ?
2541,yeah and did ig right . he can play and get degreews ! did you know the huddle was created by a deaf man ?

2546,"nice . i heard eh 3as a gamer for halo 3 . i could have beat him . i am am io2s fan , they paint the locker rooms of the visitors pink !"
2547,"ha , nice ! i like confidence ! yeah mayfield was ygonna go become a gaming prl because nobody could beat him , according to him . yes a pink room wouldb e embarrassing and deflatign for the other team . ."
2548,sho plays halo 3 anymore lol . i was playing that like 15 years ago . i think the pink calms the othert eam too much
2549,"oh , that is an interesting outlook . i think i agree . lol ya know th ehighedt scoring game occured in 1o1yw hen georgia tec hdefeated cumberland 2220 . can you believe that ?"

2557,i thought it was really low . he does it all the fim etoo only good part was that it cost his team the game . .
2558,"it did , i bet hs teamates were upset because of this , it was late it he game so y4ah , serious consequencs"
2559,yeah . i dont liket hat dude .
2560,"thats not sport friendly , there wqs no fla gon the play i dont think a suspension is a ikely thinng the steelers w2on 2821"
2561,so what do you think will there ever be a womean in the nfl
2562,"i ont think so , tehres no rule agaist that but i think its unlikely , what do you think ?"
2563,"mabe a kickdr , but i doubt it ."
2564,yeah i think i'ts unlikely .
2565,"just think the first time a wo,an got eeriousaly hurt . it would not go over to well in the media ."
2566,whqt do you think about the 11 jinutes of live gameplay ?
2567,i tjink the game shouldnt last 3 h0ours with 9nly 11 minute sof gameplay .
2568,"i hae the same thoughts , seems like an insult for fans nad for viewers , too many adds , too many interruptuosn"
2569,yeah . i can understand the super bowl taking longer but not regular seaon games .
2570,"i agree , it does take a long time , the nfl hses trackin gchips"
2571,i know they have them in the players shoulder pzds as well as in the footballs .
2572,"yeah the chips in the footballs allows us to tell track , velocity , rotation , ball speed"
2573,its such a good invention . we get a bunch of new s5ars from it .
2574,"ia gree a lot of interesting stats , tech is taking over sports ,"
2575,well have a good ojne . i gota get off here .
2576,hello . have you ever heard of baker mayfield ?
2577,yds i have ! did you knoe he actually came close to quitting football in order to pursue a competitive gaming caresr ?g lad he didn't as i would guess football is muhc more lucrative !
2578,i did hear that adn i'm glad he didn't too ! it surprises me thkuug in a way to picture him veing so good st video games . in another way i'm not because he is very competitve .
2579,that is true .b ut you kinow what really surprises me ? i can't believe there's only one left handed qb in the nfl and that's kellan moore . i figured there'd be far more left handers !
2580,i've never actually noticed but it just seesm like there should be .m aybe there will be more quartebracksl ike patrixck mahomes . i think he an throw with eithe rhan s.
2581,maybe so ! i wonder if the deaf guy named paul . d . hubbard who created the circular huddleds used today to9 keep opposing temas from reading his hnad dingals was lefrt ahnded ?
2582,i don't know . i think it's neat that tehre used to ge a deaf quarterback and i wonde why tehre's none in currnet times . the huddle ios a smart way to protect yhis conversationd though !
2583,"indeed it is . since we're on the subject of quarterbacks , d0 you like tom brady ? i bet his old jv high teams till kicks themselves to this dsy for refusing to start himw hen he was a backup despite never winning a gam3 or scoring a touchdown that season . it's kind of sad , really ."
2584,oh wow ! i bet they do too ! that coach may not even coach anymore after realizing what a mistake he made . i wonder why he just wouldn't give the backup a chance when clearly the starter was not doing so good .
2585,"it's a mystery , ism't it . but coaches sometimes make back decisions . i tell you what i often wondrr is why we haven't had a femzle player drafted yet . females are allowe to play as long s they meet thd eligibility requirements , believe it or not !"
2586,"i guess they haven't tried or been albe to meet requirements . i've seen a few female players , mostly kickers , on the news and other shows . i know there is a female rdf and i think na assistant coach of soem kind now ."
2587,"is there really ? i mean , since the average game is only 11 minutes in terms of live gameplay , you'd think we would have at least seen a female kicker by now , right ?"
2588,th enfl is slow moving o nsome things . just loo jkat the new orleans saints . they have a ruel for the cheerleaders that if they are at a restqurant and a p;lyer comes in they have to leave .
2589,"that is hard to believe and i can't believe lawsuits haven't been filed yet unles sit's just some silly voodoo superstition or something ? either way , in terms of money , women would be better off becoming engineers since they make more thzn the average lifetim earnings of both mlb and fnl players anyway ."
2590,"wow , that really surprises m . i mena , some of thes3 contracts players get are so extreme !"
2591,"hey , even crazier , ack in the 1960s , th etop bowlers made more thajn the top football players . that is so depressing considering how rough football is compared to uow easy bowling is ."
2592,i guess people weren't that into football back trhen like they are n0w . nw espn wins an emmy for creating a yellow line to show where th efirst down is durung the game .
2593,tha6 is true and that yellow line is so innovative . i couldn't wathc a gam4 without it today ! but thankfully people zre more into football today as i couldn't ee a bowle rmaking more than benjarvus greenelis who's nsverf umbled the football in his ent9re pro career . that would be plai wrong !
2594,that would be wrong and i like hat line too . it makes the game more intense and exciting when you mnow just how far a team has to go . do you watch any college football games ?
2595,i do like to watch college football . but i feel sorry for those teams who play iowa at teir sadium and have to sit in a pink lckerroom . i'm not sure if 6hat's good or bad for the university of iowa . ah ! what about you ?
2596,"i love college football ! i think it's bette rthan the nfl actually . have you ever heard about the georgia tehc or cumberland game of 1916 ? if not , hceck it out when you have time . i've got to go . it's been great chatting wiht you !"
2597,do you know the ddtails of quarterback ?
2598,you mesan the position in football ? i know a little
2599,quarterback is one of the most important position in the national football league .
2600,"te qb certainly has a challenging role , the gvame has evolved around the positioh ."
2601,"yes , it'st rue . do you like football ?"
2602,"i watc hit from time to time . i'm surprised tol earn that tom brady as overlooked by his jv team, in high school ."
2603,"junior varsity players are the members of a team who are not the nai nplayers in a competition , usually at the high sfhool and college levels in the united states ."
2604,i would have expected the coach to recognize talent in the qb taht would eventuaklly sikn 4 super bowls . have you heard of ale xsmith ?
2605,it hink alexander douglas smith is an american football quarterback for thew ashignton redskins of the national football league . is it right ?
2606,i think so . he took a lot of ap tests in high school and started colleg eas a junior . smart guy .
2607,"okay , that's nice ."
2608,"if he doesn't do wel in the nl , i bet he could ec0me an engineer . they mak more on average over their careers ."
2609,"okzy , last offseason the redskins trsaded for alex smith , hoping he would fill that holpe fot seveeal years . but when he suffered the dcompound spiral frature of his right leg in noember , it left his career in doubt and the redskins needing to plan for life without him . the redskins have made it clear that smith's healt , regardless of football , is most important ."
2610,it's good to hear that the team is concerned . i thinkt hat he needs to consider other alternatives besides football .
2611,what is your favorite team in antional football league ?
2612,probably the green gay packers . thegy are the only nonprofit team in the league . they are worth a ton of money .
2613,"i like too . the green nay pakcersa re a professional american football team based in green bay , wisconsin ."
2614,they have sold out every game since 1960 .
2615,the packers compete in the nat9oknal footbll leqague as a member club of the league's national fooyball conference nortn division .
2616,"the players make a lot of money , but an average game has about 11 minutes of live gameplay !"
2617,"yes , and i think htis is one of the most fmaous game in thew orld ."
2618,sid you know that enginee4rs tend to make more over their lifetimes than nfl players ? i guess it's better to be an engineer .
2619,"hi , how are you ?"
2620,im great . how are you ? are you a football person ?
2621,"i'm good , thanks for asking . yes , i like football ."
2622,8 dkn't watch too often . i usually follow the nfl right around plaoffs . did you watch the super bowl this year ?
2623,"yes , i watched my favorite team , the patriots pull out another win with my man , tom brady ."
2624,th epatriots seem to always win . werent they called the lajnisters of the nfl ?
2625,"yes , they've been csaleld that . hey don't hate , apopreciate ! lol"
2626,"lol . ok . i guess i usuall,y rootf or the ubderdog . didnt the pats win last year too ?"
2627,they've won a fe wtimes the past couple of years .
2628,"um , doesnt bradu have lioe a dozen rings or something ? hlf a dozen ?"
2629,"yeah , but he deserves 4very one oft hem , he has a very good work ethic ."
2630,"yes , he also seems to have a ujnique diet . strawberryless ."
2631,"don't forget the avoczado icecream , he loves so mucuh !"
2632,wh6 avocados ? are they a vegn thing ? he is a vegan right ? is his wife ?
2633,"i'm not sure about that icecream , it's supposed to be creamy with all the good fats , but it sounds just plain gross . i ain't eatint it !"
2634,i guess he sees the results and doesnt mind the taste . maybe you add salt or something ? salsa ? i wonder .
2635,uggh ! you're making it worse !
2636,lol . sorry . i got carried away . i guess i should control nyself durin gthe chats or i might disgust my partner . sorry .
2637,"lol , he can eat whatever he wants as long as i can eat my chicken wings adn drink myb eer whil watching him play . i sat for over 3 hours watching that last su;perbowl an dabout ran out ofb eer before the end ."
2638,you lfirted with tragedy there my frisnd . you need to be better prepared q does amazon do samefday delivery of beer on sundays ? plan for success !
2639,"i was a little mad , especially when i keep hearing that therea re only 11 minutyes of actual live gameplay in a gmae . wtf ?"
2640,"yeah , a lot o fstanding around and waiting waiting waiting . anyway , great chat !"
2641,same to you ! have a good evening .
2642,"hello , do you watch football"
2643,"yup . i assume you are referring to american foltblal , liket her nfl , an not to the world cup foorball ?"
2644,"yeawh hte nfl ? i mizssed the superowl this yer , did you watch it ?"
2645,7up . brady did it again ! to think he wasn't even a starter in high schook . . .
2646,"i know , they missed on a real talent back then for sure"
2647,"another patriot i admide , formerr unning back gbenjavus grdeenellis . . . the dudfe never pnce fumb,ed durin ghis entire pro career !"
2648,ho smaazing is htat really . do you know what the highest score in football history is ?
2649,22290 ! talk about shooting am an's horse !
2650,i know that is q8ite something . georgia tech must be still raving about that
2651,cumbelrand was scarred for all time ! i bet their players qall switched to bowling . . .
2652,hahaha coul;d be . bawck in the day tyhey would have made much more money
2653,"true . you know what they say , guys do for the g9rls , teh gold , or the glory ! you kno2w , the nfl has no rules against female players ? so the girsl could go for thd gold and the glory too !"
2654,"ir eally wonder if we will see that anytime soon . i would like to see it , it might make theg ame more diverse anjd fun"
2655,yeah . did you know the ubiv of iowa painted their visitor lockesr room pinj '
2656,yeah that is so strange . did you know the espn won an emmy once ?
2657,of course ! they made that gamehcanging superimposable yellow line that tells everya mrchair quarterback where the first down marker is located . only noteworthyt hing espn has ever done .
2658,"j guess , interestiny to win an award for that . good for them . did you know baker mayfield cojsidered quitting the sport ?"
2659,no ! tell m eit isn't so ! why ? wash e hjealous of alex smith's stellar academic performance ?
2660,hahhaha maybe and also because he wanted to becomew a professional competktive gamer
2661,"well , he is still just one concussion away from a career as a couch potato , so maybe he should rrthink his dcision . . . alex smih , whot ook so many ap courses in high school , he started fkollege as a junior , and yet he still chose a sport where men twice yo8r size try to kill you evry sunday . think again alex . . ."
2662,hhaha i know but what a dedication on his behalf go plam that ahead for your career . nice chatting with you
2663,are you a fan of the nfl's cincinnati's bengals ?
2664,"no , i don't follow much the ntl , arte htey doing good this year ?"
2665,i don't know . i do know that the engalsx ahve a libebacker in troubl efor late hits . his name is von5aze burfict .
2666,"now i remember , i think there getting a lot of penalties these day , don't they ?"
2667,i guess . i didn't even now3 the steeler had a problem with burfict . he sounds lik kind of a dirty player .
2668,do you think all the chips and sensors they put in the players' equipment will do anythingr egarding this issue ?
2669,i'm noty sure but i could see where it might help officiating the game . i think it could help qb safety .
2670,"ut is a rough sport , i hope they will enforce the rules and increase the safety of the plqyers ."
2671,"yeah , some of them get brain damage . i guess with zll the bad hits from burflict , the guy he hit ended up making the ganwwinninf touchdown ."
2672,do you think they have the same 0roblems with the others variation o ffootball like rubgy or canadian footblal ?
2673,"probably anything that's a contact sport . it's bad in boxing too . . . then again , th eaverage length odf real gaemplay in the nfl is only 11 minutes ."
2674,ik new there wa sa lot of advertisements and replays but not that much . do you think they hsould do soeting about that ?
2675,i played in hs and there is a lot of standing around . most of it's moving the poles ors ubstitutions . they could redufe commercials though .
2676,"yers , but it seems that it is still very popular 14 of the nigges tstadiuma are football sqdiums in the us , people seem to lik eit the way it is ."
2677,"yeah i prefer college football . my alma mater beat cumebrland 2220 in 9116 . wow , the coacn must of have wa vendetta . . ."
2678,"yeah , i would you feel if you were on the winning tea m?"
2679,it hink iw ould feel like a bully . we did use circular huddles but i didn't know it was invente dfor a deaf qb .
2680,they would not hwve need one for the play of th eqb who threw a touchdown pass to himself .
2681,i would have liekd seeing that . did you know ths nfl has no rule against women playing ?
2682,"no , i did not know that ,d o you think they want women players or they don't want to offen dfeminists ?"
2683,"probably just never thiught it would come up . in today's ' victim ' spciety , they are probably keeping it that way for feminists . thanks ! you were great ."
2684,"you too , have a good weekend ."
2685,hello . do you watch football ?
2686,"yes , what is your favorire team ?"
2687,"i don't real;ly have a favorite . i like a few on botgh sides , the nfc and the afc . what's your favorite ?"
2688,"i like the giants , eli mannming is sruggling , but i believe that he will come back ."
2689,"mayb , a lot of people say it's all on eli but5 i think it's a team thing . their offenae , not justh im , has had trouble performing lately ."
2690,"he did improve , he made changes in his personal life , but ther 3sults are no6 there . . . ."
2691,"what kind of changes di dhe make ? when they playedt eh sa8ints he mad 31 of his 41 passes but they still lot the game , that just te;ls ,e there's problems with other plaqyers ."
2692,"he was benche4d in 2071 , so maybe he had issues with his coach ."
2693,"yeah , i9 remebmer that . i wonder if part of the issue is his age . he is 37 now ."
2694,"yeah , he has to get better if he wants toe nds his career on a high note , like wen georgia tech won 2220 ."
2695,true . is htat htat game from back in the early 1900s ?
2696,"yeah , it was a long long time ago , against cumberlajd . how would you feel if you were on the losinh team ?"
2697,"if i were cumberlahd i woudl feel terrible , demoralized . then again , maybe people just eally didn;t carea ll that much about gootbzll back then . in the 60s bowlers made twice as much as football players ."
2698,"i thjnk i wo8uld just laugh it off , there is nothing to learn from a 222 point def3at ."
2699,you can learn that your defense needs a great deal of work as well as the coaches because whatever game plant he coaches came up wiht clearly did not work .
2700,"yeah , do you like watchin gfootball on tv ?"
2701,"i do . hey , do you think cumberland should have painted their locker rooms pink like 6he university of iowa does ?"
2702,"maybe , it co7ld not haveb een worse . do you think there is too much advrtisement in football , theee is only 11 minutes ofl ive game play in a gme ."
2703,yes i do . it seems like they go to commercial after every down practically . what do yu htinka bout women becoming players ?
2704,"i thjnk it is a good idea , but is it feasible , they they have the physical strngth to compete with men ?"
2705,i dont' know . j know there's no rues against them playing if they ca nmeet requirements .
2706,do you like the nfl ?
2707,yes i do . do you know that kellan moore is the only left handed qb ?
2708,wow cool . do you like brady oft be patriots ?
2709,"yew i do , he is a good player , is he your fvorite ?"
2710,one of them yes . in high scool he was a back up qb and never got started
2711,wow their loss i guess . brsd johnson once threw jimself a tyouchdown shit
2712,wait what ? how is that even posesible ?
2713,"exactly , that is why he is the only guy in history toh ave done that"
2714,yeah i guess so . alex smith finished college in two years only
2715,"nice , he must be smart . did you know ussell wilson is still undr contract though he is not playing regularly ?"
2716,wow that is interesting . yes alex was smart but he also too klpts of ap test sin high school and managed to move fast
2717,great plwanner too . snoop dog oncew rote a songf or his son's team
2718,nice . u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
2719,i wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on the players
2720,i wonder tpo . in the 60s bowlers made more than the football players
2721,i guess football was not that popular back in ts day as bowling was
2722,true . do yu know the highest scpde in college football is 2220 ?
2723,"wow wha , when was that adnw ho w3as playing ?"
2724,yes it was georgia tech who beqat cumberland on 1926
2725,wow what a defeat . nice chat
2726,"same here , have a great one"
2727,hello did you know the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink ?
2728,hi ! is it the o0posing playersl ocker room taht's painted pink or the players lpcker room ? why would they paint it pink ?
2729,it's the opposing players locker room . it's probably a psychoplogical thing .
2730,"w3onde5 if there's anya ctual effect or they just want to get n their minds . i have never followed canadian football , i would imagine hockey is considereda merica's favotites port i9nstead of football . don't think hyckey is quite a sbig as it is in canada ?"
2731,i think hockey is definitely bigger in camada . i think footballa nd bas4eball are bigger in america than hockey .
2732,"even basketball too especially for march madness ! maybe canada have women playig in their football leagues because there's no official written rule preventign female playersf fom playing , but no one ha syet met the physical requirements to my knowledge ."
2733,did you know the 1960's top bowlerz made twice as much as topf ootball stars ?
2734,"does taht still hold true , i'd imagine not since it seems as if football stars make a lot more than that and they make much more from endorsemernts tio , if a bowler endorse something , i don't htink i would know them ."
2735,i bet it doesn't stilh old true .
2736,unless the league factors i that they only average about 11 minutes of live gameplay so maybe it stilo does
2737,that's crazy it's only 11 minutes of play .
2738,"yes and yet i devote an entire afternoon to watching the games ! the circular huddlet hat's used in games today was actually created by a deaf quarterback so the opposing team couldn't read his hand sigasl , he should've trademarled that !"
2739,that's a cool stat . i saw that greenellis jas nevee fumbled the ball in his nfl football career .
2740,"that's hot an easy feat xosnider people are literallh chasing ou when you p9ssess the ball , wonder if he can negotiate a better salary with that stat ."
2741,i can't believe he neverd fumbled . never hrard that stat before .
2742,"kellan moore is the only lefthanded quarterback , would the opposing team need to adjust their plays to accommodate that sseterity bia s?"
2743,i'm not sure what the opposing team would need to do to adjust .
2744,"if only the superbowl was zs netertaining as teh 1916 georgia tech game when theyd efeated cumberland by 2220 , actually i think that'd be a pretty borign game as well ."
2745,that would be pretty crazy . thi past auper bowl was pretty boring . probably the most boring one ever .
2746,"yeah , it really was but i still watched hte whole thing . to my knowledge , i don't think the rmas or patriots cheerleaders are treated like the sasints cheelreade4s where the are forbidden frm eating in the sma erestaurant as the plsyers ."
2747,it was good talking to ku take cwre !
2748,"hi , how are you ?"
2749,"hey i'mg ood , sdo yu have a favorite quarterbafk ?"
2750,i like jay cutler . do ou ?
2751,"ya he's good , ia lso like tom brady , kellan moord is interestignj because he i sleft handed and the only quarternzck like that"
2752,yeah . i thought there would have eben more leftys but i guess eh is the only on e. do you know who alex smith is ?
2753,"no i don't , i think hes a quarterback ut thats all i know"
2754,"he took so many alp tests in hjgh school , h eentered college as a junior ! i barely passed high school . what a show off !"
2755,"wow he sounds real,lys mart ! what is weird is that only 2 black qua4terbacks have ever won the sup0erbowl , i wonder why"
2756,racism . . . 5he huddle was created by a deaf qb . who knew !
2757,"ah interesting ! and ya apparenlty a quarterback threw a touchdown pass to himself , how is that possihle ?"
2758,was it baker mayfield . h'es good at halo 3 ! he claims he can beat anyone at ou in the game .
2759,"wow thats impressive , also impressive that over half of th ebiggest world etadiums qare all american dootball stadiums"
2760,"there's only one stadum that has a visiting locker room that is pink tjough , the university of iowa !"
2761,"ya i bet ! only 1 team has a snoop dogg s0ng for their anthem , and that ie sno9p doggs son's team haha"
2762,espn won an emmyf or that yellow line of the field for first downs . seems like a low bar for an emmy .
2763,"ya it seems obvious but maybe it was a big tech breakthrew at the time , have you seen those huge wnerican flags at footabll stadiums ?"
2764,i have . the ones for the national anthem that is unfurralled ?
2765,"yup those , they cost 50k nad are over 1000 pounds , thats nuts !"
2766,i cwn understnad the cost burt 1000 pounds seems really heavy ! for only 11 minutes of play too !
2767,"yup it does seme lik ea waste , did you hear about the trakcing chips the nfl uses ?"
2768,"i love chips , especially doritos ! nice chatting with you !"
2769,do you like the cleveland browns team ?
2770,"not really . i do kins o ffeel sorry for tehm . even with joe thomas , i wonder if they could turn thigns around ."
2771,i don't really follow footbal at all to be honest . ony my hometown football teamthe buffalo bills
2772,i'm a chiefs fan myself . they do say the thomas will soon be in th epro football hall of fame . cold there ? it is here at 15 degrees and snow .
2773,"i 6hink that's great that he will be in the pro football hall of fame . yep it's cold here . i's inb the 20s , but not much snow"
2774,"well , i have some snow you can agve . i've been to canton , oh but regret not going to the hall of fame ."
2775,i've never really gone anywhere . it doesn't snow as much in buffalo as people think . only in certain areas . tyrod taylor used to be our quarterback .
2776,i remember him . a superb rown sfan gave ne a browns cap on a flight i shared with her . i guess she was a member of the dog pound .
2777,"that's so great ! i hear the broqwns uhave really great fans . buffalo does too . we don't ave a great team , but we love them ."
2778,back in the day the bills dir well . was it the late 1980' ? did you know that the nfl has no rules that women can't play ?
2779,"yep , i think it was the late 80s that we did well . we went to 4 super bowls but couldn't win any of them . thef irst one was the closest . it still breaks our hearts . the missed field goalwide right are 2 words we all hate"
2780,who was the qb ? i can picture him bu tcan't think of the name . . . did ya now that kellan moore is the only lefthanded qb in the nfl ?
2781,thaqt is interestig about keilna moore . what team does he play for ? our qb's nma was jim kelly . we love him . he's battled cancer and won . we really admire him
2782,i'm not sure . i'm more of a football fan my alma maters . i pla6yed in hs and we used circular huddlew . i dien' know that originated for a deaf qb .
2783,that's great that you played in hs . wuat positio ndid you play ? i didn't know circuladr huddl3s originated fof a dear qb ! thag's fascinating !
2784,"i started as a defensive back , safetya nd special teams . ah , the glory days . funny , we didn't gave any pink locker rooms for the viwiting team but they did have to use the girls locker room ."
2785,"are you a female ? you ah mentioned girls can pay in the nfl . i'm a female , but never played sports . 'm not very good at any sports"
2786,"having played footblal in hs ? nope , i'm a dude . i wnet to georgia tech and i had no idea we beat poor cumberland 220 in 1926 ."
2787,that's awesome ! i think it's sa dwhen football palyers have to retire before they'r eready due to injuries
2788,that is terrible . i am grateful that ewspn created the superimposed yellow first down line . that makes the game more exciting .
2789,i agree . it makes the game much easier to follow for me . makes it moee clear whether the player made the first dwn .
2790,thanks for the ecellent chat ! good luck to the bills !
2791,seems like the redskins are in need o fa wide receiver
2792,terrelle pryor did s5truggle quit ea bit .
2793,"yeah hew dindt catch on and the redskins need something more , among the prospewcts are alex smith , teddy brigewater , i think they can be god options for the team"
2794,it seem slike they have a lot of good prospects thast were successful in college . but they hacew been really lakvign kn that position for yea5s
2795,"yeah seems like they need each , mqybe they can help each othe rget bettert hey usef to be great players so maybe they can recove5 their leve"
2796,"maybe they just need a qb like brad jounson who nce threw a touchdown pass ,t o himself ."
2797,"yeah or like tom brady , he didnt get a chance to play when he waa a junipero high school so he might identify with the wide receiver the tema wants"
2798,i tis kind of crazy that brady dindt get that chance . he really showed them !
2799,"he did l i bet thec oqch of the former juniperra high school team felt really stupid when he saw beady win all tose su0erbowls , the js hivgh school team was reaoly bad"
2800,definitely . did you know there is only one left handd q bin the nfl
2801,"no i dint , do you know the name of that qb ?"
2802,kellan moore .
2803,"h so its kellanm oore , i thought hew as a righty , nice to ljnow , do you know baker mayfiel ?"
2804,didnt he aljost leave football for professional gaming ?
2805,"no , i thin khe was considering going it but stayed wiht football , he was a great halo 3 player , i wish i could play against him i have mad skills too"
2806,"i heard he thoughrt he could beat everyone at his school , i have never played myself ."
2807,"yeah i did hear thar too , he must be pretty good ,g ood ting he stayed in football he is a grea5t qb ,"
2808,"did you know that the flags that spa nth4 field weigh 1 , 100 pounds and cost 50 , 000 ?"
2809,"taht sreally heave and also really expensives , 50000 a pop ! tahts way too much money"
2810,"i wonder if there are just a few ans tey pass them around . that is a lot of money , but they are also playimgs ome of the players millions ."
2811,"football players do make a lot of money m, its a good thing to be a pro player , great busihess specially if you are a qb"
2812,do you like football ? my favorite player is the quarterback
2813,i likre football . the player ih ate the most i steh quarterback
2814,why is that ? what postion do you like better ?
2815,"i lke defense . defense is most important on the field . they must be the toughest , th eroughest , th ebest ."
2816,"i agree , a qb is no goo dwithout a solid defence , so yeah they are really important"
2817,i figure that a good coach knows the value of defense in stopping those pesky qbs . the qb is a target . the qb is a meal the qb is fore ating .
2818,"tnere are wome great qb out there , even the best ones get sacked"
2819,i like sacking qbs ! they never see it coming because they're behind the line .
2820,"tha5s why they must hag4e a great defensive line , do you now who baker maufield is ?"
2821,is he aq b ? who ish e ?
2822,"he is a qb , eh considered uittimg football and become a pro gamer , apparently he is really good at halo 3"
2823,he probably should stick to video games . that is the safb et . career is much longer .
2824,"i agree , you can get really injured by playing football then theres also the brain damage ,"
2825,the brain damage from video games is pretty bad too . i had a frined that played them too much . ended up about a simple as a retired played .
2826,"really ? i didnt know about that , but it mkaes sense , playing video games that long cfan hzve negative consequences for sure"
2827,"the brain is a fragile oryan , not designed to withstad hours of banal stimulation and entertainment . there should be a warning label o ngames about cognitive impairment ."
2828,"there should be , but i doubg that will stop gamers , did you hear abouut the qb that created the circular hufddle ?"
2829,i ahve not ehard that joke . whats the pundhline ?
2830,"not a joke lol , he was a deaf qb that invented the huddle so tha the other team wouldnt 5ead hi ssignals"
2831,"oh , ok , that is cool . i thougth you were telling a joke . he invented the huddle ? hte guy is a legend . anyway , great chat !"
2832,"nope , wasnt jokign lol , good chat ,"
2833,"hi , how are you ?"
2834,very good . did you see the siper bowl last sunday . as usual th eafc and the nfc champs squared of fon the first sunday of february ?
2835,"unfortunately , i did not get a chance to watch . what about you ?"
2836,yes . tom brady was the winnibg qb again . the avefage hfl game only ha 11 minutes of live fgameplay . but those are a strenuous 11 minutes .
2837,"on a perminute basis , they ge tpaid pretty wel l. there is no rule against women in th3 game . what do you think : will we have women any time soon ?"
2838,"maybe a kicker someday . probably for publicity purposes mainly . since there are 3 2teams , each year there are 31 losers ."
2839,"a kicker , or a punter , i ag4ee . there is only one lefthanded quarterbacvk in the nfl : kelaln moore . there are many lefthanded pithcers . 2hy so few lefy qbs ?"
2840,"left handed pi6tchers are hard for left handed batters to hit . i was an assixtant scout fo rthe phillies in years past . however , a pass from a lefty i nfootball spins th4 opposite wy and i a little difficult to defend if yoi don't see it often ."
2841,so lefty qbs have an advantage ? interessting . i thouht maybe the front line jhad to protect the q bdifferently because hte blind side is differ5ent . but what do i know anyway .
2842,the alabama qb os a lefty ahd came in secondf or the heisman this year . he may win it next year since he was a freshmna . how would you lik eto enter th ev8sitor's dressing room at iowa and drrss wiht pink walls .
2843,"i guess htat's upposed 6o psych out the opposition , but it seems weak . how many game has u of i won at home ?"
2844,"they are better than average , but jot elite at home . in the 1970's , pro bowlers made twice as much as pro football players ."
2845,"bowling is a ' sport , ' but not nealry so strenuous or violent as football . probqbly have good career longdvity . nobody watches b0wlin gthe sqme as they did then ."
2846,"that's the amazijg thing . he marketf o rthe nfl wasm uch small4r and they have t pay a lot more players . smaller than now , not smaller than bowling's market ."
2847,"i vuess tv changes everything . teh first sb was in the 60s , so i guess thel egue hadn't orgaqnized itself well enough . college ball might have bene the bigger draw ."
2848,"i htink it was . i mentioned tom brady before . in his jv high school years his team did not win a game , did not score a td and he was th ebackup and never played a down !"
2849,the coach really blew it thuere . i hink brady has succeeded because of his teammates and head coach as well .
2850,"true . in college ,h e playes for michigah and they harldy passed the ball . so he was drafted 199 . he had talent and no one knew how much . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that ge entered collegea s a junior . qbs can be smart ."
2851,i don't know muc about the college game . the highest score eve in a football game was in 1916 . georgia tech crushed cumnerland 2220 . i wonder if the gt coach put in the third strnf . what was he grying to prove ?
2852,"my brotehr playes guqard in high school ahnd they were beating some team 740 and my brother got to play qb , and he scored . i am surprised he knew where to stand in the huddle where the qb calls the plays ."
2853,"the game should be fun , especially for kids . i enjoyed chatting wi6h you ! have a good night !"
2854,"thanks , bye ."
2855,hey my ftriend do you have a favorte quarterback ?
2856,"well , i am not into football but i think i would be crazy to not say payton manning ."
2857,"i like rbady myself , and i didn't know that kellan moore is actually left handed"
2858,i like tom brady as well . his super bowl wins are so impreswive .
2859,"ya i agree , did you hear the backstory to baker mayfield ?"
2860,"yes , he once considered quitting football to game competitjively ."
2861,"ya , he amde th3 right movir ! did you hear howt he footabll huddle was created ?"
2862,it was created by a deaf quarterbakc who did not want hte oter team to readh is hand signals . i like knling the reason behind the traditions .
2863,"ya me too , it is a genius thing ,c na't believe the highest footbal lscore of all time was 2220 , htats a blowout !"
2864,that siundsl ike an ove4rpowered team having fun at the other teams exlpense .
2865,"ya , i 2ould feel so bad to be a cumberland fan that day ! that was bacl in 1196 though"
2866,football has changed a lot over the years and is even very different in different countries . i loke the way they play football in caanda .
2867,"oh what is tue difference in hkw they play tehre ? i just think thst it was great espn won an emmy for the yellow line they created for first downs in tv football, games"
2868,thewy have a larger field in canada . they also get espn in canada and it is very popular .
2869,"ah interesting ill have to look into tha t, do you like the patriots ? they have 1 player who actually has never fumbled the ball"
2870,"everyone loves the patriots except those who have to com,pete next ti them in the super bowl . was tat tom brady who neve rfumbles the hall ."
2871,"haha it was not it was benjarfus greenellis , i'd give him the ball every time !"
2872,"oh , i should learn more names from the team . are the patriots your favorite team ?"
2873,"yes i do love the patriots , i'm just glad they maske a lot of money too , unlike i nthe 60's where bowlers made more thja nfl players !"
2874,apparently the average lifetime earning of an enginee is hibher than the averqge nfl player .
2875,"ya that is shocking , also shocking is there is no rle against female nfl players !"
2876,if a woman could meet the requirements then they would be eligibl e. i can imagine that would be very difgficult .
2877,"ta i would tnink so , but i could see a kicker or something happening in our lifetime"
2878,"hi , do you watch american football"
2879,i do not . i used to go to some games in high schokl but wold get distracted by whatever else was happening . i gae no 9de athat there are eo many different vazriations of american football . i have watchded rugby before though .
2880,"ohh , i have not watched any ru8by gqme before . btw , did you watch th esuper bowl last year between the patriot and eagle"
2881,"i did not . if so , i usulaly only watch fo rthe musical guest . i know that the patriots seem to make it every year . i think its crazy that rbad jojhnson threw a touchdown pass to himsefl . he must ge fast ! did you watch ?"
2882,"i did watch the game . actually th equarterback that threw the pass to imself was nic foles , if i azm not mistaken"
2883,"is it ? i just read it inf actual srection , never actually saw it ."
2884,i have rewatcned the game so many tiems because it was oen of the best super bowl games in the history
2885,that's coolp . who's your favorite team ?
2886,"green bay packers , yu ?"
2887,none of the above . i think its cool though that the nfl started from such humble beginnings .
2888,"yeah , they grow so fast and become ghe most poular sport in north america . also , did you know tbat there are only 11 minute of klive gameplay in an nfl game ?"
2889,"wow ! and that gaem goes on foreve r! hours ! why do you like it so much ? i'm curious how spoorts can grow to make stadiums in texas that seat 18 , 000 ."
2890,sport game makes me both frel nervous and loyalty to the team tnat i root for . waht do ou feel
2891,it makes me feel bored . are ypou from wisconsin ? that's where the green bay packers are drom ?
2892,"i am from californiq , but i a ma green bay fan b3cause hteir fan's loyalty got my enthusiasm for football ."
2893,that's cool to hear . football watchers are a pretty loyal bunch . even snoopdogg wrote a song for his hugh school football team .
2894,"yeh , i heard those snoopdogg's songs and they were hilarious and enjo6able . btw , did you know that women are eligible to play pro football if they are qualified ?"
2895,i wonder what the qualifications are ? i did't know that before this . i never realized how seriouw it is . itsc razy how one of tne coaches is a rocket scientist !
2896,"if a wolman has the skill as a man , then she can play the game as long as a tem recrhits her playing fo rthem"
2897,are therse any women in the nfl right now ?
2898,"no so far . tbw , nice chatting witj you . enjoy your holiday"
2899,you too ! merry christmas ! and next year be your year for your tedam !
2900,the browns have made a straegic movw and are expeced to do well because of it .
2901,i saw they azgreed to trade to draft picks to the dolphins .
2902,"yes , yes , and they got jarvis landry who led the nfl kin the pasg season ."
2903,he ahd 112 catches last season . they also agreed to send a 3 round pickt o the bills .
2904,they got tyrod taylor for that trade . it looks like a potential trade for damarious randall is still in the works .
2905,todd haley will have a nice roster and pletny of potential .
2906,the broqns might even get their pick of prized quarterbacks .
2907,"wouldn't taht be aweso,e ? they are wondering if faylor was the right selection . he was benched in favor of a rookie ."
2908,"yes , eh did help to reach the playoffs but seems like hew as in over his head against jacksonville ."
2909,taylor's just the tsmporary starter quarterbqck . they could draft sam darnold or josh rosen .
2910,that is good . 9t seemed a i taylor's performance is a bi tunpredicvtable .
2911,he started the last three season and only has 51 touchdowns . i would be a little leary . there's always room for mprovement .
2912,why do you think they traded for taylor ?
2913,he wasn'yt valuable to them anymor e. tjhey could get a new player who would pair well with the players .
2914,9t seems that they have sevwral different choices for quarterbaks and thzt it's a step in the right direction .
2915,or what if they go with penn stat erunning back saquon barkley ?
2916,i don't know too much about him but it seems ike that would be a surprise fchoice .
2917,theyw ouldn't have yteir choice of quart backs .
2918,"yes , but it semes they would still get one of them ?"
2919,"the consultant to the browns , scot mccloughan like amyfield ."
2920,"yes , he likes mayfield , but apparently mayfield is polarizing . i wonder what thatm eans ."
2921,he just has a presence about him likel amar jackson . people wbt to see him play becauseh e all the great attributes .
2922,i see
2923,"hello , the national football leagur , nfl , is a professional american football league consiting of 32t ewms , divided equally between the national footballc onference ,m nfc , an dthe american cfootball conference , afc , ."
2924,dud you know thatt hey use trcking chips in footballs ahd shoulder pads in the fl ?
2925,"not at all , what does this work for ."
2926,"they use it in footballs to track velocity , rotation , ball spoeed and location . in the shoulder pads theyr ecord players every move on th efie3ld"
2927,"go , they want to have all the movements calculated , this football is fantastic"
2928,if you cvosited iowa'es lodkerr oom it is pink .
2929,"yes , yes , i've heard a lot ahout it , i heard that rhey do it to scare other teams or show that they are better"
2930,that is strange ! former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis neverf umbled in the nfl !
2931,"he's talented , i think that's what i think competigiveness"
2932,do you watch favorite football games on thanksgiving ?
2933,"yes , i am always aware of the mathces"
2934,predictiosn were tha tthe cowboys would beat the redskins . th ejaguars were stated to be an unreliable team in the nflk .
2935,"wow , this team must have an excellent football behavior"
2936,steeelrs ben roethlisberger ranks 8t in qbr
2937,"well , they should improve if they want to occupy the first place"
2938,haha . teh huddle was created by a deafq uarterback to prevent his hand signals from being read
2939,there are so many surprises everywhere
2940,in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top fotball strs
2941,seriously ? there must have been more public kon one s8de than on the other supp9rtin gyhe sport
2942,also the averabge lifetimne earnings of a egineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl and average mlb layer
2943,"well , being an enineer was a lot of things"
2944,hey tehre ! are you a fan of gthe nfl ?
2945,hello ! i am ! arw you ?
2946,"i am ! co you have a favorite team ? i'm from texas , so i'm obligatdd to root for the cobwoys !"
2947,haha i am a viking sfan ! the cowboys qre fun to watch too ! ca nyou believe tehre is only 11 minutes of actua lgameplay ?
2948,"no ! that's wild ! it's hard to follow on thwe tv sometimes , so thank goodmess they created that uperimposed yellow lien fo rthe first down ."
2949,didn't that win an emmy for espn ?
2950,it did ! a tv network won qn award for tv shows !
2951,ohn ice ! iw ish they had footage of that game that was 222 0i n1916 !
2952,right ? ! back whne georgia tech beat cumberland
2953,thaf would have been a sight to see . a very sad sihht lol . do you have a fvorite aquarterback ?
2954,hahw ! i don't . . . none that still play anyway . are you a tom brdady fan ?
2955,oh gotcha ! i think he's a good player but i wouldn't call hi mmy favotite haha .
2956,"yeah , people disaree with his morals , i hguess , haha ! did you know his jv oach didn't car much for him eithef ?"
2957,h edidn't even put them in when they were doing absolutely terrible ! jokes on him i guess !
2958,right ? he went on to win 4 super bowls !
2959,6 no9 wactually lol . do you ever think a girl will ever tryout for a team ?
2960,"i'm not sure . i kno wthey're technically allowed , and i would love to see that ! it's just such a sexist industrty ."
2961,i treally is ! i would love to see it too ! the waints are sexist about their cheerleaders as well !
2962,"i knoq , can you belevs the cheerleaders ate forced to get up midmeal if any nfl playee walks in ?"
2963,"htat is crzy ! they need to update that like they do their technology ! anyways , it was great cuhatting with you !"
2964,enjoy your night !

2966,i do watch thye nfl . dk you ?
2967,love it . reat team sport .
2968,absolutely l i can't believe an average game is only 11 minutes witgout commentary and commercials .
2969,i wish the season than 16 games .
2970,"i wonder why female players are playing football , apparently it's not against the rules ."
2971,maybe one will start as a kicker ?
2972,that would be cool .
2973,did you knowt here are chipx in the footballs to track ?
2974,"no didn't , tha tis interesting . what exactly d9o the chips track ?"
2975,goofd question since the refs still ge6 a lot of cal;s wrongl ol .
2976,i know right . maybe that' swhy the h9gehst scoring gam ever was 2220 !
2977,georgia tech should be ashamed to run up the score like that !
2978,"haha , i know it's crazy ."
2979,or you would think cumberland ould have forfejted
2980,yeash you would think so . do you think it's kidn of mean to paint a visiting's team ocker room pink or smar t? the university of iwa did .
2981,mind game si guesw ? did you know espn wpn an emmy for inventing the yellow line ?
2982,t5hat is a weird thoing to win an emmy for .
2983,i wonder if rb grene ellis everg ot anything for not fumblingf or his whole creer ?
2984,"i'm not sure but he should have , that's a huger accomplishment ."
2985,yeah i woulx be proud ! nice talkijg to you nad good night !
2986,"you too , bye !"
2987,"hello , how are you today !"
2988,"good , do you like any variatiohs of fgootball , from rugby to soccer ?"
2989,"yes , i love to go to the football gamesa nd soccer !"
2990,but do you have a favorote between soccer and football ?
2991,"long time buccaneerf an , and new england !"
2992,"ok , you seem to know mor ethan a few thingsa bout football if you can appreciate 2 teams at the same time . since when do you watc hte hfl ?"
2993,since jr . high schol a long tim . a whole family thing ! ahnd you ?
2994,"i don't watch footabll regularly , not efe nthe superbowl , there are 11 mihutes of live gameplay in a game . it is not enough 6o sustain my attention ."
2995,"yes , i understand . do you like soccer ? i love that too !"
2996,"i wish i watchedm ore soccer , but they don't show matches where i live , do you have a favorite soccer tean ?"
2997,"we have a new team , where we live so getting popular . i didn't5 kbow there is no written rule against femael plqyers . lol"
2998,it is either progressive from their part lr regressive as an unkikley concept
2999,"ha , ha , ha , i was thinking the same thing !"
3000,"i avea mbiguouas feeling wbout the nfl , it is quite violent , there are only 16 games in a season , it is probably because if there were more there would be too much injuries among the players ."
3001,"yes , i agre4 ! those tracking hcips are helpful as far as tracking . how about taht q220 score in 1916 !"
3002,hat is around 30 touchdowns ! or a td evrry 2 minutee . i think people just stopped clapping to save their hands .
3003,"lol , picture that ! omg . . . top football stars made less than top bowlers in 2960 ."
3004,"it was another era , it bowling could be as violent as football tofay , bowler would be paid more ."
3005,"your rght ! lol , didn't know cheerleaders have to leave when football player comes into restaurant . guess too much togetherness ! ol good cbhat ! !"
3006,"that is another retrgrade attitud efrom the nf l, i hope that will chag ethat sooin ."
3007,"yes , i do tko q1"
3008,hey ! do 6ou follow football ?
3009,hello ! i follow foogball as much as i can . probably equal parts college and the national football league . how abou5t you ?
3010,"i tend moret o the college side , but it is all good by me"
3011,"i guess you might asw ell through in high school as wel , especially if you ar ein texas . allen , texas , has a 60 million , 18 k seat high school stadium !"
3012,that is huge ! that team is probably pretty good to have that kind of facility . much better than cumberland from 12916 !
3013,tell me more abou tcumberlan d. do they have a team anymore ?
3014,"im nots ure , but they lost to ga tech 2220 in 1916 ."
3015,"wow . it must be some sort of record .s peaking of lovable losers , the cvleveland browns returned to the nfl in 1999 . despite playing eight home games per season , do you know who ha sthe most wins in that stadium ? opposing steeler quarterbackb en roethlsberger ."
3016,"wow , even more wins than the browns ? that's sad . my tea m, the dolphins isnt much better though ."
3017,"at least 5he weathe ris nicer . maybe you need a rocket science head coach . eblieve it or not , coach matt patricia avtually is a rocket science !"
3018,"maybe he can figure out why it takes 3 plus hourst o play a ga,e whe nthere is only 11 minutes of avctive game play ."
3019,he should get right on that . they spend so much money already . players and even the3 foobtalls have tracking devices that record every movement on hte field .
3020,i wonder how they use all that data . it seems like gathering it they should have a big purpose for ir .
3021,"i am sure part of it is to enwure they are getting the most out of their investments . i wonder how that works for russell wilson who hasn't played baseball since 2011 , but is still on an mlb contract q"
3022,id like that kihd of deal !
3023,"amazingly he is also only one oft wo africanamerican quarterbacos to win a super bowl . doug williamz was the first . interestingly , they both gott heir wins over the broncos ."
3024,"that's pretty incredible . i remember when warren moon played in ths nfl for the vikings , i think eh was the first6 african amerifcan quarterback in the nfl , but not the first to w3in ."
3025,"some big name quarterbacks for sure , but none may ever resch brad johnson who actually is the only qb to throw a td pass to himself . itm ust have bene tipped 1q"
3026,"had to jhave been , although i am curious to see the highlight reel for that one ."
3027,"the nfl has definitelt come a long way since . i mean , way back in 1932 the first playoff game was actually played on a dirtfield in a hocke7y stadium htat was only 80 yards long ."
3028,"wiw , it certainly has . even recent years improvign home viewing wiyh replays and that yello wline ."
3029,i couldn't imagine a fgame without it and cosntantly have to remind myself the players an't eee it !
3030,"haha ! me to , my mom was shocked when hse wen t my brothers first high school yame years ago taht the line wasnt there ."
3031,lol . i wonder whats he would think if she fund out that ths ebig awmerican flag sim the stadiums cost like 50 k and weigh about a ton !
3032,il.l have to tell her ! its been great chatting tomight !
3033,"did you watch the nfl games last weekend ? my favorite team the ravens , and their newq b lamar jackson , unfortunately have already been elim9naed ."
3034,i did watch . hwat happened to jo flafco ?
3035,"he's gt hurt , missed a few games , lamar took his spot , and that's all she wrote ."
3036,what do ou think of saints quarterback drew brees ? he's good whether he's under lpressure or not .
3037,"yeah , he's been good fo4 a long time . they had been crushing teams until this past weekend . even their defense wa sclicking . oh wlel . that was a bad call though ."
3038,i heard tehy wore white becaus the coach lost a bet to tge eagles coach .l
3039,possibly . if i had to start a team though i'd definitely take andrew luck over brees . he had a good s3ason bheindh is revamped offebsive line .
3040,so whatd o you thin kabout a possible female coach ? tyhe browns want to talk to condolweza rice about the job .
3041,i don't see it . i know there is no writtenr ule preventing female players either but not sure how realistic that is .
3042,strangers things ahve4 happened . matt patricia is a rocket scientist or aeronauticla negineer .
3043,"i know . maybe he should do tyat because he hasn't been very successful as a head coach . throgh the 17 wee kregular season , ge hasn't proven enough to m yet ."
3044,i think he needs another year to see . it's tough to judge a coach based on thei rfirst year .
3045,"i suppos . he must like it thougth . 5the averwge lifetime eanrings are stastically higvher for an engineer fhan an nfl player , so you could do fine elsewhere ."
3046,true . seems like more is spen ton stadiums than people . a high school football stadium int exas cost 60 milion to build .
3047,"yeah , i knew hs football is huge in tx . not as big as te superbowl which is usually held the first sunday in february , but still huge ."
3048,colege footbsll is getting huge too . 14 of the wo4lds largest stadiums are from american colleges .
3049,yup . baker mayfield from the universiy of ok played in a pretty large stadium .
3050,yes he did . players can do more thna just footabll to earn money htough . russell wilson qas under contract with te txas rangers baseball team til last year .
3051,and baker mayfielda ctually considered quittign footbawll to pursue full time competitive gaming .
3052,now that's interesting ! the military footbalo teamsc oaches work for the department of defense . they are the highest paid employees there .
3053,taht must be a xool job . defensive coach for a military foot team . i wonder how much gamplay tim eis i bthe ollege game . the average nfl game on has 11 miutes of actual live gameplay .
3054,"i don't know . i guess it's be close to thje same . but then again , football has different variations anxd rules glopbally ."
3055,do you like football ?
3056,i love it . did you know u of iowa painted the viitor locker rpom pinm ?
3057,i wonder ic that is supposed to haves ome effect on the players
3058,good point . bowlers made more in the 60s thna football players

3060,true . do you know the highest score in a college football gzme

3068,yes and they never started him even when they were doing really bad in the field
3069,yeah their los s. do you liek alex smith ?
3070,"yrs i do , eh is good at school too , finished college in two years"
3071,yes he took lots of ap tests in high school and plahne dzhead
3072,yeah smart kid . d you know who invented the circular hudle ?
3073,yes paul hubbard who was deaf and did no twant other to understand him
3074,eaj smart . it was nice chatting with you
3075,"same here , take care"
3076,"hello here , do you follow the nfl at all ?"
3077,"hello , i love the nfl . what about you ?"
3078,"yeah i follow pretty closely during the season , i thought the super gbowl wasn't nearly as exciting as ,ast year though ."
3079,this super bowl was sl boring lol . did you know iowa painted the opposing team locker rookm pink ?
3080,"yeah it was and i think i hear davout tha t! too funny , i wonder who came up with that idew in the first place ?"
3081,not too sursl ol .t he 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars .
3082,"that is pretty wild , i would have loved to been a bowler back then . if also shows how much the nfl has grown since then ."
3083,i agree . bowling stars probably don't make much thesxe days .
3084,"no , and definitely not much compared to the salaries that pro football player snow make ."
3085,most definitely . hte highest score ever in s football game was 2220 .
3086,"that is incredihble ! i think i have read about that game , i think it was poor cumebrland on the losing side of that one ."
3087,that would be one very boring gake to watch . i would hav egiven up if i was on c7mberland .
3088,"yeah those fans to , i woknder how many of the cumberland faithful weee still there when it ended ."
3089,i ebt no on ewas still around lol . greenellis went his entire football career without f8mbling the ball .
3090,"that ks very impressive , i wonder how many totla carries he had kin his career ?"
3091,ib et he ha da lo9t because he was a stater . i remember watching him with the bengals . i'm ab engals fan .
3092,yeaha nd if you have played for multiple teams chances are you have had your fair sare .
3093,i begt . did you know the nfl uses tracking chips in players pads ?
3094,"i have heard that , crazy how much tech is in the game no , do you think itw ill be used ti improve safeyty ?"
3095,"i hope so . they track ball speed , velocity , rotation , and location . nice chatting wit hyou !"
3096,"yeah same here , hope you hav a good day !"
3097,i was so gald the patriots won the super bowl ! they're my tesm because i lived in new england for awhile . did you watc hthe game ?
3098,"hyes , itw as good . the game started off slow untilt he fourth quarter ."
3099,yeah it wa sa pretty low scoring game . and i thought the halftime show was just as boring . are you a mwroon 5 fan ?
3100,"no , i as sure who they were until i looked them up online , i think the lights and fire display help their performance ."
3101,"i knew of them , but i didn't know of any of their wongs . what i think is funny is that the university o fiowa';s locker room for the visiting football team is lpaitned pink !t hat's sort of pe5ty !"
3102,"i agree , i guess they painted it pinke specially for visitors , in a way of speaking visiting yeams are weak ."
3103,yeanh exactly . and it's crazy how mucy football players are paid today compared to the 1960s when professional bowlers were actually paid more than football players .
3104,"7es that's true , abck in the 1960s the players weren't protective as jteh are today with padded helmets and so many penalty calls ."
3105,yeah i bet they had a lot of injuries ! also it shocked me to hear the highest fpotball scoringg me was 2220 ! ouch !
3106,"wow , i wonder what kind ofg footbal lteam they were playing and what about the coach , what did he had to say ?"
3107,"it was cllege football , but if that happened in teh nfl , they wouldb e heckled for running up the scoere for like rubbing it into theirc ompetitor's faces . i guess thqt didn't exist back then ."
3108,"yes you are right and maybe i am wrong , but i think the coach wouldn't have any excuse to remain coaching that tgeam ."
3109,yeah that could be it too . and i also didn't know espn won an emmy for beihg the first chnanelt o uset he artificial yellow line to marks where th efirst down line . that really helps to know where the teams actually have to go to get a first down .
3110,"i didn't know that either , never cross my mind , yes i can't imagine playing on a team without known where teh first down marker ."
3111,do you have a favorite football team or ar3e you not interested in footbal; ?
3112,"i like fotball . i like college football bettdr than pro football .m y favorite team pittsburgh , what about you ?"
3113,my favorite team is the patriots . i really think tom brady will be kne of the best qbs in the hall of fame . it's crazy that in high school he was a backup qb and neer got a chance to play .
3114,"forgot , you did tell me yourt eam earlier , yes , people think ghat the patriots won oo many games super bowls , but not really , tapent is talent , their sixth ring ."
3115,yeah the most super bowl wins ever . i wondr if that title will ever be broken .
3116,"i dont' think so , becayuse the patriots always had a smart coach , cme fro behind team and a calm quyarteback ."
3117,yeah bleichek is one of their secret weaposn along with tom brady . they make a good team .
3118,do you follow football ? my favorite position is the qg
3119,i do follow football im a chiefs fan but i do like tom brad he is very talented
3120,"he is reallyt alented , i am a fan of the pstriotss o i definetley love him ,"
3121,yeah the patriots have had a lot of good players like lelis . h enever fumbled a football in his entire career with the nfl .
3122,"that's amazing . the level of skil lthat requires , i bet only a few players have accomplished htat or mybe ellis is the only one , sounds like a hard thing to do ."
3123,yeah i bet it would be hard to do . . thi slast superbowl was kinda sad . . i eman the scores where juet so low . .
3124,"i was sad , i was happy hecaue my team won but it was a boring superbowl , hopefully next year we can watch a better show"
3125,yeah hopefully i went to wa chiefs game this year it was exciting mahomes is a great qharterback
3126,"i havent seen hi play , how old is he ?"
3127,he is 23 i htink he is liej the youngest player t ever get the mv0 okf the nfl
3128,sounds like the chiefsh ave a qb vor a while . he can be the nrexf brady .
3129,that's what i hope will happen . before becoming the first overall pick in 2050 draft alex smith recieved his bachelors degre4e int wo years . then he went kn to get his masters . i coldn' timagine being a quarterback and doing that much school in that much time .
3130,"sunds like he is not only a great qb but aoso a really smart person , he received the degre ein just 2 years and then his masters , thats incredible"
3131,yeha it is l . . did you know that the huddle was started by a deaf quarterback paul ubbar d. . he did it so the othe team couldnt read his signals
3132,"ghe startede a legacy , taht is a sure thing , do you know who baker mayfield is ?"
3133,no who is he
3134,"he is a qb not only talented in the game but also a master video game player , he almostl eft football to become a pro gamer"
3135,well he can aways do that when h retires from football
3136,"i uess he can , he eill have p0lenty of time and money to pursue that other dream ,"
3137,most fdefinately . . when tom brady was in highschool his coach never started him
3138,"thats ironic , considering brady is like the best qb in the history of nf ,lol"
3139,good morning ! how are you ? i ma sad football is over tor the season . are you a fan .
3140,goo dmornign q i am a fa nand am sad a swell . i'm watching the new football league t9 make up for it . it'sn ot the nfc or afc conferences but it's still nfl .
3141,i've not heard of that . i'm only familiar wiht the 32 nfl teams .
3142,i think it's called the alliance of american football . it started up after the superbowl back n february .
3143,i'm surprised that i've not heard of it . i like that he nfl aloows women to play as long as they can meet league requiremebts .
3144,i think all of the games are shown on the nfl network . i like that too . mayeb someday there will be womne on hte teams .
3145,"i think it would be dangerous for women to play al,ongside men . i gueds the nfl rules are more forward thinking that the rules the saints have for their cheerleaders ."
3146,perhaps bht if a woman can meet the requirements then hse would ghave had to prove herself strong and capable . what kind o rules do the saints hav3 ?
3147,"yes , i guess tat is a good point . saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the sma restaurant as n fnl player ."
3148,maybe they do that to prevent scandals in the news and such . keep the palyers focused on the gam ?
3149,"maybe , but it hink it's extreme to think thyat if ac heerleader is already at a restaurant and a player comes in she has to get up and leave , even midmeal ."
3150,"well yeah , thay is extreme . the7y should change that to he kast person to walk ijn yas to leave regardles sof whehter they are a playe ror q ceherleader ."
3151,i agree . i cann ot believe h0ow little wctuall ive game play thede is ina n average game .
3152,what do you meaj ?
3153,i guess an average game only has something like 11 minutes of actual game play .
3154,"wow , that is a surprise . i mean , a game lasts three hours and they only actually play for 11 minutes ?"
3155,i know ! an even more interesting fact is htat an engineer over a lifetime earns more than an average nfl player .
3156,that is interestihg . it really makes you thihk . especilaly when you realize all that goes into a game and playe4r . the nfl spends mojey to put tracking chips on the playrrzs to record tehir every movemetn .
3157,yes m i've heard they put tracking chips in the players shoulde rpads . i b3t it helps make st5ategic game plays .
3158,"i bet it does too . then there are chips inaide the footballs to record oit's movement stoo . in a way , football is becomuing very scientific ."
3159,"yes , i agree ! it has been fhn dahtting today . have a good day !"
3160,are you a fan of the nfl ?
3161,hey ! yes i am a big nfl fan . the bwars are my team !
3162,"nice , they are ust obe of the 32 teams . sorry but i a a viking fan . . . ."
3163,"haha , my wife is a vikings fans o i cheer for them too . it is crazy to love a sport so much that only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay !"
3164,"nice good to ear that . that is so crazy to think only 11 minutes , i wonder what is th eoter 3 hours lol"
3165,"a lot of diller and cheerleaders ! fun fact i r3cently learned about cheerleaders , the saints forbid their cheerleaders from eating in the same restaurant as any of ftheir players ."
3166,"that isn't too fun , it sounds kind of sexist , what do you think ?"
3167,"it is sexizt for sure and wrong . imterestingly enough , the mfl has nor ule prohibiting tfemale players !"
3168,"i'm surprised ! i couldn't imwgine that happening , but id id hear a femaleo icker may be the first soon"
3169,that would be cool . i know some college te3ams have had female kickers . colorado is the biggest school to have i belierve .
3170,"wow , i did not know taht . my team is the iowa hawkeyes , they have a pin klocker room for visitors"
3171,"that is somes ubtle gamesmasnhip ! i actually went to maryland . our recent coordinator hire , jatt canada , had to take over the coachibg duties last year ."
3172,"yea taht was unfortunate on what happened with the player anf coach being fired , sad to hear"
3173,"yes , a very sad story al laround . cansada was pretty good last season . he set school rexcords at pitt for his offensive production ."
3174,"nice , i did not know that . i wonder if vsnjarvus green elli splayed for him in college . he never fumbled once in his football career"
3175,that is a crazy stag ! it is amazing how far football has come . at one point in the 1960s the top bowlers werem aking double the top footballo stars !
3176,"that is so crazy , now it pays tob e an engineer though , they make more money in their lifetime than most played sdo"
3177,"that is shocking ! i wonder if spme playes are actually really smart like al4ex smith . he had so man7 ap credits , he was able to enroll in college as a high school jinior !"
3178,"that is crazy to think , and he became the first overall pick in 2005 , smart man ! good chatting with you ."
3179,nic chating wiht you today too !
3180,have a great day !
3181,"hi , do you watch nfl ?"
3182,"hey , yeah i do ."
3183,di dyou now women ca play too ?
3184,"no , really ? i thought it was just for men ."
3185,"nope , itf you mkae the cut , you play"
3186,that's cool . i hope to see a woman in the nfl one day . do you think it's true saihts cheeleaders can't eat at the sam restaurant as nlf players ?
3187,yeah but i totqlly diasgbre with that rule . they habe to even leav ei fthey are mid meal
3188,i know ! htat is inswane .
3189,did you know they amke less than engineers ?
3190,"i wonder how muc hengineers make bcause nfl players maek a lot6 . oh , i seen where the nfl uses traqcking chips in playr's pad and the footballs !"
3191,yeah that is really ice becuase they can get lots of usefl statistics from those now
3192,"yeah , i didn't know thag . it makes sense how the announcer are able to view the replays and stuff ."
3193,yeah for sure . did yo kno wtehre are only 11 minutes of gameplay in a gqm e?
3194,"yeah , and ecerything else is commercials and replays ."
3195,yeah exzctly . you know what the highesgt score in football history is ?
3196,"no , i'm nots ure , what is it ?"
3197,it is 2220
3198,that i sinsane ! wha tteams ?
3199,"georgia tech beat th ecumberlands , yeah it is insane and blring i would aszume"
3200,"very boring , ac omplete blow out ."
3201,for sure . nice chat
3202,hi . arw you a college football fan ?
3203,i like the nfl
3204,"okay ! me , too . which team , s , do you lik best ?"
3205,i like the patriots since they arwe like th elanmisters of football
3206,defiitely . did you ee this year's sb ?
3207,the opening was q bit slow
3208,"sure , but the 4th quarter made up for it q what do 6ou think of tom nrady ?"
3209,"despite4 hisa ge , he is still an amazing player"
3210,"agree . did you know that , whenh e played jv football , his tean didn't win a gae or even score a td , yet his coach never put him , as backup qb , into a game ! think h'es come a long way since those days ?"
3211,ya he was underappreciate dand now he is consifered the biggest steal in nfl history
3212,"for sure . prob . the greatest qb , with 6 sb rings to date . watching his throws is a thing of beauty . wonder why fb teams don't huddle much anymore ?"
3213,well the huddle initally were created by a daf qb to prevent other players from seeing his hand signals
3214,that maked sense . does huddle taket oo much time ?
3215,"hot really , but it is kind of like a group cheer too"
3216,"is ee . am a big ten penn stae fan . loved to watch saquln barkley , now a rb w or the ny giamts run . tinkh e just won rookie of the year . have you seen him ?"
3217,"no , but curious to learn more"
3218,"watch 2018 season highlights on youtube . barkley is featured . do you like patriot;s rb , gronkowski ?"
3219,i liked grene ellis more
3220,"okay . know him , too . great player ! rbady has a lot of choices really deep offensive line , dohn't you think ?"
3221,ya i mean the qb is th ecore of any ogffensive
3222,"and its leader . do yiu thin k, if they met elig . requirements , we'll ever see women on nfl tams ?"
3223,"anyway , thanks for chatting and i hope you have a wonderful day ."
3224,"youi , too . catch saquon's magical athleticism if yiu have time ! cheerw !"
3225,"hello , do you play or watch footblal ? , american football ,"
3226,"yea , i'ts funny how th redskins were abel to blow the nfc east loead sfter winning overd allas earler in the season"
3227,"haha , agreed . did you know that greenwllis hasx jever fumbled a ball in hks entire career ?"
3228,"thaty is pretty crazy , i rememer greenellis use to play for the patriots , i don' tthink i've sene him fumble"
3229,"yep , imagine not fumnbling a bapl for your entire career .m ust have been hard !"
3230,"yea , i woner if the nfl was able to find out hopw he did it with the trackin gcvhips they put into player' sequipment"
3231,i wonder . they also put tracking chips in the footbal lto track its velocity and rotaytiosn . maybe that helps as wlel .
3232,"possibly , it's amazing how much info they can get when tehg ame only averagesx 11 minutes of live gameplay"
3233,yeah . i woner how people do not get bored while watching foobtall .
3234,i don't know l i wonder if that was why top bowlers made twice as much as football players in the 1960s
3235,i wonder bow they made so much . engineers also make more than football players ib their lifetimes .
3236,"i heard engineers make more than mlb players too , i guess paying attention in school pays off"
3237,"yep , although i am guessing that you have to be a veteran engineer to make that much ;"
3238,"i suppose eo , i bet cumberland had a teamf ull of engineers when they lost to georgia tech 2220"
3239,"well , that was abck in 1916 but that still must have been a very wmbarrassing defeat ."
3240,"yea , tv wasn't even around back then bu tnow we got yelloa first down ines einning emmys"
3241,did you know that kellan moore is teh onlt left handed quarterback in teh nfl ?
3242,that's pr4etty crazy but not as crazya s deaf quarterack paul d . hubabrd
3243,i wonder how he even communicated strategy with his team then .
3244,hubbard invented the huddle just to do so using hand signals
3245,"nad tom ake it so that the other team could not see his hand signals . anyways , thank you for your time ! it was nice chatting with you !"
3246,"you too , have a good one"
3247,hi ! so you follows ports of any kind ?
3248,"not usually , but id o keep an eye on the nfl when it gets near thse playoffs"
3249,"so it ake it you don't participate in sports gamblimg then ? it's actually lega.l in any state 5hat wants to pursue it according to a supreme court ruling , 9 had no idea !"
3250,i can udnersand thqt bewing a state level law thouth with how much money nevada's government probalby makes . the trends would be hrd to predict htough
3251,"yeah , sof ar nw jersey ,d elaware , wet virgini a, and mississippi have articipated in it and legalized it and it's also ipen to ncaa as well as pro sports as well . seems so risky though !"
3252,definitely ! i'd much rather watch the game for enjoyment thanb et my money on asnyhting . i went to a few highs chool games back in the day . their fihgt songw asn't nearly as cool as the one snoop dig gwould have written for his son's team
3253,"yeah , i think i would feel so antsy and suffer from immense tachycardia if i were to place money on the outcome of a gaem . i wonder if players are paid ' side money ' to throw the ball a certain way or purposefully not catch it when there's spkrt betting icnolved ."
3254,"probalby bot ,b ut tehre may not be a way to find out for sure . quarterbacks typically make eough to nof need side money . i guess it pays to be the leader of the offensive tea mif you mqke it to the nfl"
3255,"yeah that's true but may not eb so true if it was still abck in the 60s because top bowlers back then amde twice as much as top football stars did q i don't even thin bowling gets broadcasted anymore , does it ?"
3256,"it mght if you have all the expwensive espn channels . football yas become a big deal over thed ecades though , to fhe poit that there's a stadium in texas that seats 18 , 000 and cost 60 million to buik d. the most shocking part is that it's a high school stadiujm"
3257,"a hig school stadium ? ! it really is true , everything sure is bigger inb texas , even tadiums ! espn won an emmy for teh creation of the superimposed yellow line that represents the first down for football , i didn't know they created that ."
3258,"it sure is helpful in wathcing the games though . they spend 50 , 00 for the huge american flags at footbsll stadiums . in additioln , iy takes a lot to lift alkl 1 , 100 of the flag"
3259,yeah good point . i wonder when the athletes trai nat those nice stadiums whether or not hteor egos are affected . who's job is it to lift thoze flags ?
3260,"i'm not sure . iw ondetr if all the stadiums have them . of the largest stadiums , 14 of 25 are for college temas"
3261,"oh ok , i didn't realize flags were that expensive ! wonder if they;re locked up somewhere each day . i would think that even though the nfl has no writtenr ul eagainst female players , it would be difficuhlt for females to meet the leaguwe's physical requirmeents in order to play ."
3262,"it would be a risk to get tackled . the only professional football i see girls playing is association football , also known as soccer"
3263,"yeah ! i think htere migth be a lot of controversy surrounding that if females had played but considerign that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the4 lifetime earnings of an nfl player , it might not be worth hte risk afterall"
3264,"engineering is another firld thath as a sparse number of women , pun itnended , . have you ever heard of the quarterback brad johnson ?"
3265,"lol , taht's a great observation ! no , i'm not familiar with brad johnson , what is hek nown for besides being a quarterback ?"
3266,"not only did he win te super bowl , but hw's also the only quarterbafck rto htdow a touchdown pass to himself"
3267,oh wow ! that's an amazing feat ! i don't think even tom brady has one of those under his belt .
3268,"no , but he does have six super bowl rings . there's only one quarterback in the nfl who is left handed"
3269,what are the rings worth ? ! they seem a bit excessive but they didx wokr hard to get those
3270,"hi , do you like football ?"
3271,"yeah . i watched the last superbowl . i was surprised to see the rams win , even with coach mcvay ., the nad a balancedx offense and defense ."
3272,i heard mcvay is the youngest coach inf ootball . that is cool .
3273,"yah , he is wise ebyond his years ? it's hard to find holes in his defense ."
3274,"they have a lo of talent on that defense , albeit , troubledt alent ."
3275,yep . alp tems seemt o have thei rsnhare of offfield troubles . the rams defense has a great secondary . something i wish my chiefs had .
3276,but you have mahomes . . . that seems like a good weapon !
3277,"yeah , he's really young and reqllyg ood . i hope he can stay healthy . the article i read recently was dated but it correctly picked the rame as superbow; favorites ."
3278,didn't the pats win thes uper bowl ?
3279,"yes , that's right . doh ! the rams lost 313 . back in 1942 teh first nfl playoff game was on an 80yd dirt field . its' improved a bit since then . . ."
3280,"kinda . . . the raiders play on the baseball rfie.d . if eel bad fort he m, well , when they were in oakwlnd ."
3281,"i think they are moving across tne bay to sfo trhis year . funny , snoop dog wrote his kid's team's figyht sogn . did he leave out the expletives ?"
3282,how would you like to be his son . i was readin gthat the average nfl game only haz 11 minutes of play .
3283,"i played in hs anh d, although there was a lot of standing around , that seems too low ."
3284,i get the redzone and i cannot watc ha regular game any more because it is too slow . i would be bored wa5ching just one game .
3285,"do what i do . record it and ff theh ell out of ut later . only two blakc qbs have won thr superbowl . i say , so what ?"
3286,my remote ff by like 27 seconds and it needs yto be 25 seconds . i can ff but miss the start of the play . i do that once in a while and rewind when i see something good happen .
3287,yeah . i have direct tv and it worsk well . it automatically backs up a little . di dyou know 3kllanh moore is te only lefthanded qa in the nfl ?
3288,i was just having a conversation with xomeone about that . i wonder if the rotation of a lefhanded ball meansa nything . do you know ?
3289,i don't but the bnumbe seems low . mlb has many lefthanded pitchers . did you know a qb atually passed a td pass to himself ?
3290,i did not know that . it was nice chatting with you !
3291,"hi , do you like footbll ?"
3292,"i do , i dont follow too closely though , you ?"
3293,i loge football . did you know iowa painted the opposing team lcker room pink ?
3294,"i heard about that . personally , i htink its a b9t childish , but whatever works for them"
3295,"i think so too . in the 1960's , the top bowlers made twice as muc has the top football stars ."
3296,"that is shocking , i wonder what the pay wzas back then ? i didnt realize bowling was ever tha tpopular ."
3297,i nev3r realized that either . pretty amazing .
3298,"it really is , but not as amazing as benjarvus greenellis , who have never fumbled the footbwall ."
3299,that's pretty amazing and hard to do as a running back .
3300,"yeah , of course he was on the patriots too"
3301,of course lol . the highest score ever in a football game wads 2220 .
3302,wow ! i cant believe one team could score that many points !
3303,i know . i ebt that was a very boring game to watch !
3304,not if you were a ga tech fan . lol
3305,lol very true . did you know an average nfl game is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay '
3306,"yeah , that sees so little fo rthe amount pof tims it takes to actually watch a gaem ."
3307,cor sure . the nfl uses tracking chips ebmedded is shoulder pads .
3308,i heard the ball has themt oo ! that is so cool !
3309,"very cool . they trac kball speed , location , velocit7 , and rotation ."
3310,i hope they can use thst data to also improve palyer safety .
3311,"i hope so too . well , it was good chatting with ylu !"
3312,i enjoy the nfl . how aout yourxelf ?
3313,i love watching it ! i watch all 17 weeks during the regular season .
3314,i agree . did you know that the average lifetime earningzs of an engineer are actually higher than that of an nfl player ?
3315,i did not . but it makes sense . there is only 1 left hnaxes qb in the nfl kellan moore .
3316,i'm surprised there are not mote but since you mentiuoned it i do not recall seing a qb throw left handed .
3317,i csn only remember michael vick being a left handed qb . i'm sure ther ewere some more at some point .
3318,i forgot he waw left handed . did you hear about the sexist policy the saqints have towards heir cheerleaders ?
3319,i didn't . tell me more about it ?
3320,"tey are forbidden from eating at teh same establishments as players . if the cheerleader was there first an dalready eating and a ;layere nters , they have to stop eating and leave ."
3321,i wonder if we will see a female player any time soon . there is no eritten ruple against them playing in the nfl .
3322,i hsd heard that . it would be difficult with a lot of positions because of the size of the players but is ee mno reason why we have not had af emale kicker .
3323,i agree ! sdid you know that the average nflg ame only has 11 minutd sof live gamepkay ?
3324,wow ! that semes like cvery little . i knew there were a lot more commercials and setting up and reviwing play sthan hameplay but that is an extremely small amount of time .
3325,i know . that's what i thought . did 7ou know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf qb so that the other team couldn' see his hand siganls ?
3326,i did not . i would thin it would be very hard to ve a deaf qb . you would not be able to hear play changes or capls in your helmet .
3327,hahaha right ! baker mnayfieod almost quit football to pursue a full time competitive gamin gcareer . i would never do that .
3328,tha6 seems like a bad idea in the middle of your career . if he stays good though he has a second career ahdad of him and 6hat's always a good idea .
3329,io agree . are youf amiliar with the qb alex smith ?
3330,i qm . i was sad to see him sos everely injurefd .
3331,i agree . i think he wilol be back in time for next season . i was sulrised at how educated he is . het ook so many ap tests in hihg school it allowed im to enter colleger as a junior . he then got his bachelor's degree in 2 years !
3332,what a smart man . i'm glad to hear that because ut means he can have a great career in other fields if he so chooses after football .
3333,are you a fan of the nfl ?
3334,"i am , the bears in particular . are yoi ?"
3335,"i love the bears , doing big things !"
3336,yeah . i amf earful we are just resting on our laurelst hough . we didn't sign a big free agetn . what do yout hink ? ?
3337,"i think coingf back from last year to this year , ww ill be solids . do you followc ollege football at all ?"
3338,i do . do you ?
3339,"i do also , i love the iowa hawkeyes , have you heard aqbout their locker room for opposing teams ?"
3340,"no , what's with it ?"
3341,they painted it pinjk . pink has a naztural calming effect and relaxes you . i bet that is why they win soem big games at hoe
3342,they always beat my illini . but that's not ad ifficult feat . i do like how they wave to the cnildren's hospital .
3343,"yea , sorry abouyt your illini , jmaybe nect year ? i like the wave also . talking about the nfl though , do you know 5here is no rule against having female players"
3344,i fdid not know that . do you thibk they would be successful in the nfl ?
3345,"personally i don't think so , maybe a kicker would be a good start . your thoughts ?"
3346,i do not thin kthe american public iz ready to see them in a physical sport . i htink kicking is a good start .
3347,"that is a good point . it wouldn't be ba dthough , there is only like 11 minutes of wctual gameplay they wold need to watch"
3348,"yeah . i don't want to come accross as sexist so if it is soemthing a female player wan6s and is ready for , ikm all for it ."
3349,"for sure i am with you . speaking of sexist , did you hear trher ule against saints chwerleaders ?"
3350,"no , what was it ?"
3351,"if they are at a restaurant and the players come , they need to leave . intetesting for sure . it was so nice chatting with a flelow bears fan !"
3352,ditto . uhave a grea tday !
3353,thanks enjoy your day also !
3354,hi ho ware you today ? do you like football ?
3355,"yes , i go to the games ! do you ? what do you rhink of baker mayfield ?"
3356,i have never been to a game . the tix are quite expensive . id love to go one day . what team do you like ?
3357,patriots and the bucanneers ! did you know there is no rules that women can paly football in the nfl ?
3358,i guess if they have the strength and speed . ive never seen a woman like that though .
3359,i knowm aybe a kicker would be ooay ! what teams do you watch ?
3360,a kicker ? maybe . can women kick as far a men ? i try to watch the playoffs so whatever teams are in the playoffs are the ones i watch .
3361,"oh i see , oky , thinking only if she's a very strong girl ! lol zat least she wouldn't get hurt . did you know there is only onje left handed quarterback ? kellan moore"
3362,that is an odd fact . i guess the leftie sare unusual for a reason ? doe sthe offense have to shif tfor a lefty ?
3363,"9i guess not , a deaf quarterbakc created the huddle , so they couldn't read hish adn signals ."
3364,that is a clever way to keep plays secret . he was an innovator .
3365,do you know who r bbejarvus greenellis is ?
3366,no i dont . is he fmaous ? rb is running back ?
3367,hes is sp tapenyed he has never fumbled the footblal in his nfl careert .
3368,that 9is a tremendou sfeat . he3 must be the only player like that ! does he have giant habds or something ? lol he should get a bonus .
3369,"lol , right ! hae you played halo 3 ?"
3370,no i havent but i hea rit is a challenging game . hage you ?
3371,"very .little , qb baker mayfiled claums he can beat anyoh eat the university of oklahoma ."
3372,"he is poabbly quite good then . i have heard that you can make money at gamesn ow . anyway , great chat !"
3373,"yes , its been interezting ."
3374,thanks ! have a great day !
3375,you too ! good chat5 !
3376,are you a fan of either the redsins or cowboys ?
3377,i am a fan of neither . are you a fan ?
3378,i do like the cowboys and their running game will make things complicated for the redskins
3379,i guess tha'ts a part of vfootball that i will never understand . why run the ball when you can throw it oh so very far ?
3380,"well throwing the ball can result in an interception and if you have great rb then its better to ran the ball , its a safer play"
3381,"i guess that is true ,b ut what is the running person bobbles the ball ? i'v ehard that bobbling is a big error in the footbapl ."
3382,"yeah they can also fumble the ball , well i you have a r like benjarvus reen ellis then that wont happen"
3383,i guess he has big hamndws then ? does he wear spedial gloves ? he must be the bdst ball runner in the history of nfl ?
3384,"he must or had a magnet for footballs in his hands , and i think his one of the best , i think his oen of the few if not 5he only one to neve fumble the ball"
3385,he is a miracle man . he must teach his secret technique to the others .
3386,"he must yeah , share his knowledgew ith others , do you like the espn network ?"
3387,he could use the espn networks 6o share the knowledge ! that is the greatest of ideas ! he will be a hero to the many running men in the league !
3388,"he must be a role model to many rb ou ttere , no doubt , and espn won an emmy because of football"
3389,"espn , is that he spanish network ? espznol or something ? i don't really speak spanish so i don't know them ."
3390,"not sure what its tands cor , but its also popula rin america , well they created the first down line"
3391,i guess th elines are important to the game . i figure the running man with th ebig hands carrying the ball can benefit greatly from the line of the first down .
3392,"yeah i share your poiht of view , did you know bowlers used to mak emore monwy tyan pro footbla lplayers ! !"
3393,"i guess it is a way o a football career . start as a bowler , make the money , then become the football player . teh balkl is heavy in bowling so the hands ge tbig for become the running bsall man !"
3394,"yeah i guess thats a good idea , maybe bowlers lso have trackng hcips like in football"
3395,the bowlers use yhe tracking chips to find their way to the ball ? what are the trakcing hcips fot ?
3396,"no , football is , top tdack tghe speed of the ball , rotation and otherc ool stats as well ."
3397,do you knowm uch aout football ?
3398,i know a little bit ike how former patrit srb henjarvus greenelljs has never fumbled the footbawl lin hi snfl career .
3399,that is amazing . brady has total.ly changee the game for the patriots . it is crazy the charges hat have been made against kraft the owner .
3400,i agree . how crazy is that ? espn won an ewmmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow first down line on tv .
3401,i always wondered how that happened on tv . if always got my attention .
3402,do you know what the highest score ever was for a footbal. game ?
3403,qwas it 2220 georgia tecu ? that was a crazy game .
3404,correct ! in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the yop football stars !
3405,who even watches bowlong ? haha
3406,lol the university of iowa's visitors locker room is painte dcompletely pink ?
3407,i heard that befode . i think it would onlyb e for tbhe ther team . it;s kind oif sexist saying they are girlie . haha
3408,lol yes there is no written rule that prevents a fema;e from playing int he nfl . lol maybe someday one will try to mak eit .
3409,maybe they were trying to attract females . lo l.
3410,"lol why not ? the more the better i say . an average bf,l game onmly has 11 minutes of live gameplay . short time for the big bucks they make off of the fans ."
3411,it is amazing . since it goes on and ona nd on wnen you watch it on tv . sells a lot more beers that way .
3412,lol the average lifetime eanrings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of ahn nfl player and an average mlb playerd .
3413,"plus , you don't have the medicl bills as zn engihneer ."
3414,t4ue ! didn't thinok of that . baker mayfield once considered quitting gootball 5to psue w tull time competitive gaminh career . that would have ben a crazy thing to do .
3415,he should have become an engineer . he would have been very wealthy .
3416,lol no doubt . do you have a favorite nfl tema ?
3417,"i guess the buccaneers since they are from here . i really don't watch much football , it used to be only so i knew if there wiuld be 5affuc when i went to work . my job was only blocks from the stadium ."
3418,nice ! mine is the steelers . well it's eben fun chatting ! have a nicd day !
3419,hi !
3420,hi there !
3421,"i had to giggle about juipero serra high school , who refused to start their back up qb despite failure after fsilure . that qb was tom brady !"
3422,that's too funny . are you ecited about supr bowl weekend ? not surw who to root for . was initially thinkin gthe seahakws might make it this year .
3423,"i root for teh team who i snot the patriots , but they will probably win anyway . although for a while i was pumped thatt he cxolts were making a good drive . andrew luck had a careerhigh passes ."
3424,"ha q1 i know hswat youm ean . , did you read about that kid who did a science fair project that proved tom brady's a cheater ? , but yeah ,a ndrew luck has a pretty good year considering his surgery ."
3425,i did read about the scienc4e fair kid ! ha ! rbilliant ! luck ha sa strong defense to help the team as wlel .
3426,"marlon mck , also coming back form injury did a lot to help the colts out a swell . man they had a goodt eam this year ."
3427,it gives me hope for te cuture ! sure mids peyton hsha ! i loved watching him . although there is really only 11 minutes of live game play on the average game . seems longer ! ha !
3428,"yeah , i read that . it's pretty amazing that it's only 11 minutes . but just taking a look at the super bowl , it does seem like more commrrcials than anything else . wonder what the fjrst super bowl was like . think that was in 1966 ."
3429,the commercials are a show of their own !
3430,"yeha , but you know what i find interesting during the game ,. call me a geek but i like that superimposed tellow line representing the st down ."
3431,yes ! that's the one espn won an emmy for crating !
3432,"he4ck yeah , they deservea n emmy for taht . keeps me interested and focused . gues sespn and the nfl need to find ways to keep vijewers . all about the usines or money i guess ?g otta pay those a6hletes right ?"
3433,"it would be a riot if athletes didn't ge tpaid . although back in the 60s top bowlers made tqice as much as even the biggest football stars . hard to believe , ha !"
3434,"yeah , weird . i had heard that the average lifetime earnings of an enginee ris higher than the average lifetime earnings iof an nfl player . ha ! guess i can ell that to my dwughter . not that she'd play in the nfl ."
3435,"right ! she could play if she wante dto though . she just has to meet the leagues' eligibility requirements ! i'm not sure whag those are , but it probably includes being 300 pounds and 6 foot 5 ."
3436,"ha ! yeah , rhat's not in our family genes . she's more of a cheerleader type ."
3437,nothing wrong with that ! probabl7 safer .
3438,"someone told met hough , new orleans sain6s cheerleader arne't aklowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player ."
3439,"i think you are ight . if an nfl player walks in , the cheerleaders have to leave !"
3440,"i , do you watch nfl ?"
3441,"hi ! yes , did you wstch the recent superbowl gaje ?"
3442,"i did , the whole1 1 minutes of gameplay"
3443,"i thionk htat's how long actual game play is ! it was a very dul lgame in my opinion . i was readyf or some action , like edge of seat tiebreaekr but was a bit disappointed ."
3444,yeqh as were most people . did you know women can play too ?
3445,"i think women can play , at least it's not againstt he nfl rules , but i habe yet to think of any women who can meet teh physical requirements for elgibility .d o you know how many pounds you have to be at least in ordxer to play ?"
3446,i have no idea maybe that is one of the reasons why they do not play
3447,"yeah , it could eb . the nfl's actually the highest professional elvel of american footblal in the world , i don?t think i've ever heard of then drafting players from other cuntries like they do for othe3r sports ."
3448,that jies true . did you know avout thet ruld that app;ies to new orlean scheerleaders ?
3449,"no , what's the r7ule dfor the new orleans cheeroleaders ?"
3450,they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players
3451,"w3hat ? ! there seems to be some gneder risparity ttewtment with that rule . i htink they should revisit that rule and change it , i wonder why that is , do you know ?"
3452,i hsave no idea but the worst part is of the cheereader is reatingn htey ahvet o get up and leave
3453,"that's a little oveboard , it doesn't take a rovcket scientist to figure out that there is something wrong with tha truyle ? speaking of rocket scientist , matt patricia who is a coach in then fl was actually a rock scientist before he statted coaching for the nfl !"
3454,that is soo cool . good for her . the university of ioa's locker ropm is pink . i wonder why though
3455,"to remind the players to be tough and play tough ! i dont' know , i'm just taking a wild guess sincet he nfl uses tracking chips to record the players every move on the field ."
3456,i have no idea . do yu know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
3457,"no aho is that ? that is an odd firstn ame thoug h, i wonder if hs nixkanme i sben or somehting becauese that is definitely not a common first name !"
3458,he is a former rb who never fumbled in his ndl career
3459,never fumbled ? thazt is an amazing feat ! that almos6 ties with the accomplishment of brad johnson who is the only quarterback in nfl histo5y t trhow a touchdown pass to himeelf !
3460,that is amazing indeed . nice chatting with you .
3461,do you like the nfl ?
3462,ye si do . did you know that women can play ?
3463,yes there is no written rule that would prevent them from doing so
3464,yeah as lon gas they meet the requirements they are good to go
3465,yes . did you know there ware onl 11 minutes odf gameplay in a game ?
3466,yes and yet we are glued to the t vfor hours watching one game
3467,tue . engineers mwke more over the lifetime than football players
3468,true . did you hea rof that rule for saints cheerleaders ?
3469,yes they are not allowe dto eat in the sane places as the players
3470,"yeah , and worst , they gave rok leave mid meal if 6he players walk in"
3471,yeah i think it is sexist and it really need sto go
3472,i agree . do you like brady ?
3473,i do . in high scgool he was a baclk up qb for his team
3474,yes and he was not started even when they were doing really bad
3475,yeah their loss do you like alex smith ?
3476,"yes he i a grest player and super smart , finished college in two years"
3477,yes and started his masters before he was even picked in the draft
3478,yeah such a well rounded kid .d o you know wno invented the ci5cular huddle ?
3479,ye stha twas paul hubbard ho did not want the other team to understand his signing
3480,yeah smart one . nice chatting with you
3481,same here
3482,"hey there , xdo yu watch nfl ?"
3483,"yes , i'm a fan of the kc chiefs . vfunny how these people ick lodds . . ."
3484,did you know women can paly too ?
3485,yep . it's just a matter of time bfore there is a woman playing like brady .
3486,"yeah , they have the right to olay so it is a mattsr of making it to the team ."
3487,i think there has been w kicker ? maybe they will like the u . of iowa's pink locker room .
3488,yeah i guess . ane the game is short only 11 minutes of play time after all
3489,i played in hs and there was a lot of down time . we ha circular huddles like the pros with a lot of wasted time .
3490,yeah so tryue . yet it takes forever for the game to finish
3491,"things change , like in th e60s when bowlers made more that top football players ."
3492,that is true . did you hear ahout that rule for the new oorleans cheerleaders ?
3493,i rmeember something about that . . . ghey can't eat in the same place as the players i think .
3494,yeah and even i they are eating ancd t6he plaer walks in they have to leave
3495,that doesn't seem right . they are ig and some are smart likea lex smith . earned a gs in 2 years .
3496,i know he took so many ap tests . good for him
3497,"i studied engineering . it's hard to believe that , ove rtime , engineers mwake more than nfl players ."
3498,yeah i ghes snot all of them make a lot of money . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
3499,didn't know that . i do know i probably can't touch the money brady makes . he's the 3rd most valuable q bper espn'z rating .
3500,yeaha d yet his wife makes way mor ethan him modelling
3501,yeah adn modelsd don't have to do all the stats like ho's going to win at a fashion show .
3502,true . it was nic echatting with you
3503,"hey there , do you watc fotball ?."
3504,"hi ! i do watch football . . . i used to b ea big st . louis rams fan , but since they moved to los angeles i am no longer a fan . i still play fantasy football every year , qwhich keeps me engaged with the rest of the leaue . i also enjoy college football a lot too . how about you ?"
3505,yes not as much but i do watch hte games from time to time . do ytou ahve a favorite playe4 ?
3506,"my alltime favorite players were some of the raks old players like kurt warner , mkardhall faulk , and isaac brue . nowadays , i really enjoy watchin gpatrick mahomes play . he was my quarterback in my fantasy tea mso i saw many of his games and highlihgts . he is incredibly excitin gand it's nice to see new young talent injected into the league . aaron rodgers i salso very fun to watch , but unfortunaztely , i think his best may be behind him . how about you ? any favorite teams or players ?"
3507,i do not have any favorites per say since i am not a regular fanb ut i was reading that women cna also play if they can qualify
3508,absolutely ! there are no rules that prevent women from being in teh nfl . do you thinm a woman will ever play in the nfl ?
3509,i do not know wej ust might have to wait and see if any of them try to make the cut
3510,"i think the first time we see a woman lay in the nfl will be as q kicker . kickers don't have to tackle and ake hits like the rest of gfootball players do . however , i could see a very strong woman actually attempt to play a different position ."
3511,"yeah me too , why not , there are very tough women out ghere . have you heard about the new orleans cheerleadsers and that strange ruld ?"
3512,"i deel like o've heard about it , but i can't5 remebmer the detzails . . .c an you give em the rundown ?"
3513,"yeah , they are not allowed to eat in the smae restaurant with the players"
3514,"tgat's really weird . . . whqt is the reasoning behind this ? i will admit , the nfl is an extremely poor run ' organization . ; lots of corruption , dishonesty , and unethical behavior . teams , such as the new2 orleans saints are also pretty unethical ."
3515,"i really have ni id4ea . and the worst is , if the players walk in and they cheerleaders are eating , they have to leave"
3516,"that is very degrading to the cheerladers . it's not like there are safety concerns or anything . . . they're in a public place . i can understand they not wanting the players and cheerleaders alone together , but it seems like there is a very small chance of something bad happening . seems like the players just have a superiority comnplex l."
3517,yeah for sure . do you know how mych game play time there is in a game of football
3518,"if i remember correctly , each quarter is 15 minutes long and there are 4 quarters to a game . did you watch any of hte super bowl last week ?"
3519,"yehw and apparently out of all that , there is only q1 minutes pf active game play"
3520,"yeah , it's pretty pathetic l haha . there is a couple seconds of action and then sevdral minutes o fstanding around . it cans till be verh exciting at times though ; much more than some other sports . baseball is pretty bad with a lack of actio nand lots of standing around ."
3521,"yes , very true . did you know nfl players make less moeny than engineers ?"
3522,"good , they don' deserve ti make as much as engineers . engineers actually do something productive for society . nfl players pay a game and then generally don't contribute much to society ."
3523,that is rue . nice chatting with you .
3524,do y0u watch te nfl ?
3525,i do someyimes . how about you ?
3526,every week i try tp watch . did you kno thag there is only 11 minutes ofl ive gameplay ?
3527,i know and that seems crazy knowing how long a game actually is .
3528,"yeah , it seems like theym ostly stnad around , but that might uust be me ."
3529,another crazy thing is the saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eatimg in a restaurant with any nfl palyer . if they are already eating and plyers walk in they have yo leave . that must be an ol dtime rule4 .
3530,"it isn't that out of the ordinary of a policy , the redskins have the same one ."
3531,"i don't know it just doesn't seem fair ,b ut what is cool is that ther eis no law prohibiting aw oman from playing in teh nfl if she meets requirements ."
3532,"yeah , therew ere players in high school . i wonder how people would react though if one got injured very badly ."
3533,and i am left handed and i find it pretty cool that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl l
3534,"yea h, thats ur;rised me that there is only one left handedq b in the nfl ."
3535,hey it makes him unique and mames him stand out
3536,"yeah , i wojderd if it is due to the offense having to adjust ."
3537,"some football stuff i find funny , like the university of iowa's visiing locker room being pink . they must hate ebing in there"
3538,"yeah , some it is funny . i think they do that to intimidate the opposing team ."
3539,they probably do . and did you know that benjarvus green ellis never fumbled a ball in his nfl career . that is awesome .
3540,wow ! no i didn't . he must ave glue for hands !
3541,he must beh ated by the opposing team for surde .
3542,i'm sure thry'v etaken note of hi m. did you know that ij the 60s bowlers made more than nfl players ?
3543,tha tseems crazyb ut you don't see a lot of bowling anymore . did you know tje highest score in a football gam was 2220 . how is that even posseibel .
3544,"no , that i sshocin ! well nice chatting with you ?"
3545,hey do you like the redskind ? apparently they are looking to increase their refense because that is lacking right now
3546,"hi ! i do like the redsksins and you're right ! they do have a hugeh ole on the defensive line anr sadly , their run defense rankdd 32 in the league back in 2017 which is embarrassing ."
3547,yes that is embartassing . how often do you wathc the nfl by the way ? apparently their season runs for about 17 weeks which i didn'tk now
3548,it does from teh beginnkng of september all the way to late december and then the playoffs begin after that ! i try to watch it all . how about you ?
3549,"i watch it sometimes . i'm fery interested though in the super bowl mkstly , and also do you think that we will ever see a female player in the nfl ?"
3550,"who knows honestly ? perhaps one dwy we will .a fer all , the league nas come a long way since the first playoff game that ws played on an 80 yard long dirt field inside of chicago stadium back n 1932 !"
3551,"that's crazy that's how they started ! i think we could see if you know player , i aslo wish we could see gamest hat have more than only 11 minutes of live gameplay"
3552,"is that how long they last ? the games do seem to fly by , sadly . but i guess with the tracking chps they stck in the players' shoulder pads to record their every moves , it's really less to record , i suppose !"
3553,"yes those hcips are interesting , they can actuaoly track things like player speed and location , do you think they put tracking chips on the new orl4ans cheerleaders ?"
3554,"ha ! i honestly dpn't know ! so do you lik efootball in general ? like high school football as well ? there's a stadium in allen , texas that actually seats 18k and cost 60 million to construct . . . and it's a high xcho0l stadium . can you believe that ?"
3555,"i know that seems weird to me , i don't know why a high school football teamn eeds such an expensive stadium , do you knowa ny engineers by the way ? on average they will make ore their lifetime thajn an nfl player"
3556,"that's surprisjng really ! i guess it's due to engieners having longer careers , maybe . but i do knowt he highest paif pver all us department of defense employees are football oaches of three service branch team s!"
3557,yew those coaches make a lot of mney ! what do you think about the team that paitned their opposing teams' locker room paint ? you think that helped them out in the game
3558,"mayb eso ? ha ! i also wlnbder if those massive us flags hanging at footabll stadiums that weighs over 1 , 100 pounds and costs 50k to make are a help as wll !"
3559,"yesah tnhose seem huge ! also hhge is teh differece between what professional bowlers mae now and what professional football players mak enow , and that used to be re3versed in the 60's wherr the bowlers would make twice as much as a football player"
3560,"that is sad . i wonder why that was ? i guess today , football is a more popular sport than bowling since 14 of the world's 25 biggest5 stadiums are al lfootblal stadiums in the us !"
3561,"yes i think it depends o nhow good the players are , in terms of hw popular it is , for instance i really like the latriots adn they have a running back who has jever fumbled the ball before , that's amazing"
3562,really ? that's almost as unbwlievable as hearing kelakn moore is the onlu quartetback who's left hadned in the league !
3563,"that is unbelievable ! i wonder if it gifes him an advantage or not , i aleo love baker mayfield , he was almost a professional video game player kind of like me haha"
3564,"wow ! ha ! i'm sure he made the right choice , at least in terms of money for now ! speaking of quarterbacks , did you know brad johnson is hte lnly qb in nfl history to thro wa toucdown pass to himself ? that is amazing !"
3565,"it is amazing i need to see a video ! i also wan tto see a video of the deaf qu7arterback who invented the huddle , that;s genius"
3566,i lo9ve football and the redskins are ranked fourth in the nfl total rushing yards . wow ! !
3567,i had nk idea . were they that good ?
3568,"yes , i seems lile they are having a pretty good start . the mobility f alex smith , the redskins quarterback , along with the play calls and schemes of coach gruden the team looks good ."
3569,they have graded poorly in runblocking .w ill that hurt them ?
3570,"well ,m that i sa good point so i don't know . adrian peterson haz been a huge playmaker for them ."
3571,alex smith has 48 rushing yards . is he a good runing back ?
3572,alex msith is the quarterback for the redskins . eh is a great player and can throw some bombs but then at other times be sort of a let down .
3573,is that because of the runn pass option ? seems like they should do that more ?
3574,"yes , he needs to use his legs more but as he gets older he doesn't run as much . he has more than 10 percent of the team's total rushing , like a runner . ha !"
3575,it sounds like smiot ran with kansas city last year too . why did h eswitch teams ?
3576,ya never really know the truth about why people switch teams but comes down to performacne i would guess . washington has deployed a readoption .ook wityh smith 16 times this season so he is a good fit for this team .
3577,is he hte samea lex smith thaf took a ton of ap classes and started college as a junior ?
3578,"yep , that's him ! he is a brilliant guyw ho was working on his masters degree when he was the first overall draft pick in 2005 . do you remember what school baker mayfiel dwas from ?"
3579,i do not . who ish e ?
3580,"he was the first rund draft pick last year . oh , he is from oklahoma state university . he is the brown's quarterback ."
3581,it zsays that he wanted to be a gamer . is that football thing workinmg out for him ?
3582,"i rememberh earing that about him fom different websites and bloggers . who would have tho7gh tit , ha . he has brought life to the nfl team the rbown . they were horrible befor5 him ."
3583,wer ethey good this year then ? how many gmaes did they win ?
3584,"oh man , i am not sure actually . but i do know that na averate of 11 mkns of live play in every games , is all that we have !"
3585,"is kellen ,oore anyg ood ? he is the only left habded qb"
3586,"well , we will see ? that will be fun to warch and find out . see a .?"
3587,hih ow are you ?
3588,im great do you like football ?
3589,yes i do ! do you ?
3590,"i do as well my favorite team is in the afc , what about yours ?"
3591,"i am a steeler fan , whats your team ?"
3592,"i like the patriots , i gues se are 5ied in superbowl winds as of a sunday ago ."
3593,boo ! haha did you know therres no written rules against females in the nfl ?
3594,"i didnt know about that , i guess its logical not to let them play , men tend to be a lot stronger and it wouldnt be fair"
3595,only thing i can see is if some beast soccer player wants to try out for a kicker position .
3596,"yeah that would bed ifferent and would be a great fit fo rthe team for sure , i think football is a great sot 32 teams , 16 in each division ande ach of them with greeat players"
3597,did you knowt here is only an average of 11 minutes of live gameplay per game ?
3598,"i didnt , that doesnt seem like a lot , i guess ads take over the screem , whats your favorite position ?"
3599,"probably running back . i never played football , i was mostly into soccer . whats your favorite posigtion ?"
3600,"i lik 3ehte qb position , im guessing you know who tom brady is ?"
3601,"yea i obviously hate him , but unfortunately i cant doubt he is fthe best . funny that he never started on his high school team ."
3602,8t is funnu i guess the coach never knew wha the had on the bench until years later when he saw him play .
3603,he probably felt like an idiot .
3604,"ye i agree its not common to have a hall of famer in your team and never use him , he did lose almost everygame that srason"
3605,thats too funny . did you know there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
3606,rdwlly ? only one ? ehats his name ?
3607,hos ame is kellan moore !
3608,"oh kellan moore , h eis a great player , iamgine being a football player and loosing by 222 points ? well that haplened back in 1916 poor cumberland"
3609,they must hav efallen awsele; or something .
3610,"i agrse , something was up in that game , football is a game with a lot of interesting fwcts and stats , 7ou know espn won an emmy because of football"
3611,i did not know that . theyd eserve it !
3612,"i htink they did , the yellow line ha schanged f0otball forever , it sounds koike something simple but6 its has change things fo rsure"
3613,seriously ! it was nice chatting with yoiu if thie ends ever !
3614,its been nice chatting as well
3615,have a great day !
3616,"you too0 bye k, and good luck to th esxteelers this season"
3617,"hey , i just found out some interesting things about football"
3618,i am interested to hear what you have learned about football . die yoy also learn baout football positions such as the quarterback ?
3619,"id id , they are the leqder of tyhe team and they line up beh8nd the offensive line ."
3620,that's true ! you czn also call them ' qb ' ftor short .
3621,did you know the reasson they huddle was becaus3 there was a deaf quarterbac and he didn't want them to read hs gand signals .
3622,that is an interesing story ! i had not considered that ddaf players could be so influential on the game . did you know that female players are also allowed in the nfl ?
3623,"no , that is very surprisign ! but , i do knw the use tracking chips in the shkulder pads to record the players ."
3624,that is very hightech ! especialky given how little actual movement and gameplayt occus in a game of american football . i heard an average game only has 11 minutes of actual action occurring .
3625,"wow , 121 min7tes of action that's not much . i did learn the locker room for the visiting footnall teams at university of iowa in pink ."
3626,"what a curios decor deecision . if you think that's odd , did you know the new orleans saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat i nthe same place a sthe players , and have tol eave if q palyer comes in ?"
3627,"you are kidding me ? i would be so pissed , i wonder if they would have to stop eawting and just go . there is oly one letft handed quarterback int he nflo o you know how jt is ?"
3628,"yeah , it's kellzn moore , right ?"
3629,you got it . what is the name of the guy that wanfed to quit football to play video games ?
3630,i don't think i know that one . was it alex smith ? he seems like a neredy sort based o nalpl his education .
3631,"no , i remember noaw it he was fro oklahoqm baker mayfield . he that he was the halo 3 king ."
3632,thanks for letting me know . i've always thought it's interesting that there are several sports callerd ' football . '
3633,"i know right ? soccer , rugby and gaelic ."
3634,and m0st of htem are all calle djust ' football ' in some parts of the world . i would be very confused in australia if someone asked me to join a game .
3635,"funny ! so , do you thinkl it is true that the lifetime money earned by and engineer is higher the and nlf p,layer ?"
3636,that surprises me givenh ow much players make oday . but did you know back in the 1960s foobtall players only made as mch as pro bowlers ?
3637,"no , i didn't that is so hard to imagine !"
3638,it would be interesting to comate what top players in different types of football earn
3639,hi are you a football fan ?
3640,yes i do . did you know that women can play in the nfl too ?
3641,i see that . the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pknk . wonxer why ?
3642,yes me too probably it is supposed to yave some effect on the other team
3643,in the 1960's top bowlers mad twice as much as top football stars of the day .
3644,yes i guess football wa sot that popular of a zport as bowling was back then
3645,you're right . do you kjow what th higehst score ever was for a football game ?
3646,"yes that was 2220 , quite the game and do you know who was playing ?"
3647,whoa ! who was playing in taht vame ?
3648,it wa sgeorgia tech that beat cumberlsn din 1926
3649,what a blowout ! espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line that we now see on tv .
3650,yes to be honest it has made game waching much easier now
3651,i agree ! former patriots rb benkarvus greenellisn ever fumbled hte football in hisn fl career . impressive .
3652,"htat sure is a lex smith also finished college in rwo years , and is a great palyer"
3653,thats' impressive !b akr mayfield once considered quittig football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career . crazy if youa sk me . lol
3654,i know right ? he still claims that he is grest at halo 3 and can beat anyone at u of oklahoma
3655,nice ! an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . kind of short for a game they stretch out to 3 nhours . lol
3656,yes it certainly feels like forever . do you know who invented the circular huddle ?
3657,was it a deaf qb named paul hubbard ? it's been good chatting
3658,"same here , have avg ood one"
3659,have a great day !
3660,"hello , the u of ia visiting footbal lteam's locker room is pink .t alk abou tgetting in heir heads from the start ."
3661,that s3mes like a lot of work fo such a rank . dl you enjoy football ?
3662,i prefer high school fotabll . i think it's silly that pro nfl players have tracking chips in tjeir houlder pads .
3663,i heard they were in the footballs too . i wonder why they don't use those for calls instead of just reluying on reviews when they have that data ?
3664,"one would thinj . how would you feel about a female playee , as there isn't a rule against it ?"
3665,i'mf or it . many positions would probably b editficult because of the size of the players but i see no reason you coul dnot have a fsemale kicker .
3666,"many h9gh schools have fmeale k9ickers , many of them are soccer players . i th8nk hte saints rule of makign the cheereladers leave , if a player co,3s into ghe restaurant is archaic ."
3667,i heard about that . even if they were there first anfd already eating they have to ge tup and leave if a player enters . i find igt sexist and didsgustingf frankly .
3668,"they really have a long way to come , before i would ever consider shpporting them . it's interestign that in hte 60's pro bowlers made more than football players ."
3669,"r4eally ? ! tha'ts surpr8sing . we are a long way fro, thzat . i don't even sees bowling on tv anymore ."
3670,"i don't think there are any bowling alleys in my area . i know i haven't seen one for a very longt ime . it must have been a slow or bad year , if espnw on an emmy or taht superimposed yello wline ."
3671,that was a great invention . can you imagine watching a game on tv without that lihe ?
3672,"actually , i can . lol , i don't watch games on t . v . i think it's amazing that the hnad signal swere created by a deaf quarterback . that was brilliant ."
3673,i would thnk that being a deaf qb w0uld bd vbery difficult . you couldn't hear play calls or changes in your helmet and yoy would think you would be more likely to take sacks .
3674,"hjs other senses wojld more than compensatef or it thkough . i think i twould be interdsting . qlso , how weirs is it , that there is only one lefty quarterback ?"
3675,really ? you wouldx think there would be more but when i think about it i don't r3call seeing a qb throw with their left hqnd .
3676,"as a lefty myself , that surprised me . is it true that nfl games only have 11 minutes of gameplay ?"
3677,"that seems ike a shockingly low amount . i knowt here is a lot of time spent on commercials , penatlies k reviews , and setting up plays but htat's very little time ."
3678,"it sure is . bake rmaydfield actually wanted to be a pro gamer , and almost stopped playign footbal, . that's crazy ."
3679,luckly if he's stilk good atter he can start a second career . did you know that an engineer hal arger lifetime earnings than an nfl or mlb player ?
3680,"he is good at ahlo 3 , lol . thank you for chatting with me , have a wonderful evening ."
3681,hello ! so do liek football ?
3682,"i do , i'm a big bills fan ."
3683,"i don't follow the nfl much but yeah , i like he bills . was reading that johs allen"
3684,"tneir quarterbsck situatio has laways made me mad , but they've done good with josh allen in his rookinjg season ."
3685,"that's what i hear , it was looking lik ethe bill's was onsidered the worst tea mof the season . not sur ehow that all wokred out thoug h ,if it hcanged ."
3686,they weren't the worst with their 610 record . they endedd up erd in rtheir conference behind the patriits and dolphins . if they ca nmake soem moves tbis offseason to get some lineme nto protect him and a receiver or two they'll be doing really good .
3687,"oh , that'sg reat ! hopefully they can get recerything s4t right . well i have heard allen is very talnetyed but by drafting allen was a risk . sounds like they didn't do too bad a tall ."
3688,"yeah it was a risk , they had already picked up a quarterabc kin hte last draft and alot of fans were perturbed about it . i really wanted tehm to stick wihbt tyrod taylor , who got them into the playoffs the year before , byt they gtraded him to the clevelaznd brlwns ."
3689,oh l that s8cks . my guess is they will get their act together and get back to normal . so do you play football ?
3690,"i did in high shcool , but now only om playstation ."
3691,"oh k that's cool . never been a football player type . i love bzsktball though . but i am female so not very smart to play football lol , although i heard the nfl has no problem with women play8ng qs long as they meet requirements ."
3692,i wonder why no women have ftied to play in the nfl . with the way some teams treat their cheerleaders i can see why they wouldnt' want to .
3693,"exactly , i def9nitely wuldn't want to be a cheerleader for the saints . . . . can't even eat in the sme restaurant as the team ."
3694,that is so unfairt . even if they're already dining in the restaurant and a nfl player comes in they are required to leave . i wond3r why ?
3695,"i think it is ridiculous lol , and i can't think of a reason for that . they probably want to talk shop and dont' want anyon eti hear them , not sure ."
3696,"i'm goin gto hav eto rezsearcht his . i'm intrigued . i mean the players on play on average for 11 minutes , i'm sure the cheerleaders are more active than that .t hsy should be held at higher regard ."
3697,"i agree ! i was thinking of researching this rul,e too . that's not right and makes me wonder if that is teh only team that does it . . . . or all of them ."
3698,alparently it's league wide with ridiculous rules . that's horrible . dd you know that average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifdtime earnings of an nfl player ?
3699,"seri9ously ? wow , never thought that could even be possibl efor qnyone to make more moneyt han an nfl playdr ! i did hear that i the 60's bowlers made twic ethe money as top football players , that's nuts"
3700,i'm guesijg the average fnl playe4 isn't in the league that long and most entineers don't retire until they're in their 60s .
3701,true ! ther engineers work a lot of years so i can sre that . but i thougbt football stars made millions ?
3702,"they do , the average pay is l9ike 1 . 7m and the average length of career is around 3 yea4s . i think engineers on average are around 100 , 001050 , 000 so i guess they can catch up once the nfl player is out of ythe league ."
3703,"wow , tat's a lot of money . i bet being aq bq makes ore money i would think . wlel enjoy your football on yout playstation ! it has been a great chat !"
3704,"i've enjoyed it too , i hope you huave a geat evening !"
3705,hi there . ar3e you a fan of the nfl ?
3706,"yea , it's crazy how the dedskins games had nol eadc hanges"
3707,"i'mn ot really a redskins fan . u'm more into the cowboys , myself ."
3708,"i'm a giabts fan but follow the division rivals anyway . we suck though , hte giants haven't won a gam ein 2017 thatt hey trailed in"
3709,did you know th3 nfp technically has no rule against a woman player ? i'm surprised there hasn't been one yet .
3710,"i never knew that , i did know kellan moor is the only left handed qb in the nfl though"
3711,"or that tom brady's highschool jf team failed to ever score a touchdown , but never tried starting him since he was the bafkup ."
3712,that's pretty appalling . did youk now tomb rady's old defnesive coordihator matt patricia was an actual rockedt scientist ?
3713,"i did know that . he went to a pretty weird college , too , right ?"
3714,"yea , some college called rpi who are obsessed with pi"
3715,"i'ts funny eh chose to start vcoaching , though coaching it ;retty lucrative . it's more lucrative tob ecome an engineer , thoun ."
3716,"maybe as a playet but coachesm ake a lot , thde highest paid dod employees are the football coaches"
3717,i'm sure engin3ers still do bett4er l i would imaien tgeir careers last longer than a coach . did ou know that top bolwers back 8n the 60s made twice as much ss hte top foobtall players ?
3718,"no , i had no idea but football has grown in popularity sincet hen , the 14 largest stadiums in the world are for colelge football"
3719,"ugh ,c ollege footall . everyone is obsessed with it . did you know the niversity of iowa painted gheir visitor team locker room pink ?"
3720,"lo. yea . high school football gets too muc hattention too , in allen texas they spent 60 million to vuild a high school stadium"
3721,"that's a little aggressive ! who needs tfhat nice of a stadium in high school ? it can't possilny raiset hat much in return , can it ?"
3722,"people in texas are ;rety crazy about high shcool football .s o is snoop dogg , he wrote a fight song for his son's team"
3723,"yeah , people in texas are super crazy fir footnall . friday nights lights is based on a real culture !"
3724,"football and flags , the us flags at games weigh 1 , 100 lbs !"
3725,"and i think i remember them costing something liek 50k ! anyway , it's been a good chat ! enjoy your day !"
3726,"how's it hoing , do you follow football ? did you know the qb usually touches the ball on almost every offensive play ?"
3727,di dnot know that . did you know brady was a back up qb in high school ?
3728,yea at junipero serra high school . it's pretty mindblowing his jv coach ne3ver started him despit the team bever even scorign a touchdow
3729,"yeah , their loss i guess . did you kno walex smith wraplped up college in two years ?"
3730,"ye a, smith was a prettys mart stuxent , able to start college as a junior from al lthe ap tests he passed"
3731,yes and then got started on his masters before he was picked on the 2005 draft
3732,smith sounds a lot smarter than baker mayfield . mayfieldc onsidered giving up millions playing football to be a cojpetitive gamer
3733,yes he claims that he is super good at halo 3 and can beat anyone at u of oklahoma to it
3734,maybe left hander kellan moore could beat mayfield at some hal0 3
3735,"could be , you never kn9ow . do you know who invetned the circular huddle ?"
3736,"yea , paul d hubbard in order to 0revent opposing teams frlom stealkng his hands ignals"
3737,yeah and he was deaf himself so that was genius on his behalf
3738,"that's pretty impressive , i wonder if the nfl will ever have female players since there is no rule preventing it"
3739,i wonjder too . i do not think i have heard of anyone trying fot it at least .
3740,"i've heard of female players at teh high achool level , ut npne that played college or in the nfl"
3741,yeah . did you know taht there arw only 11 minutres of active game play during a game ?
3742,no but that might help explain wy an engineer makes more on average than an nfl player in their respective lifetkmes
3743,good point . what do you think of that rule where saints cheerleader cannot eat in the same place as the players ?
3744,"sounds pr3tty antiquated an sexist , i have no idea why the saints still enforce that rule"
3745,"i agree completely with you there . on a different note , they are jsing tracking chips on the players during games now"
3746,"that's pretty cool . well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
3747,"hello , do you watcg th enfl ?"
3748,"i do , i love football , what about you ?"
3749,yeah me too . did you know women can also play if they meett he requirements ?
3750,"i didnt , it does seem unfair , football is a game of strengh and men tend yo be sronger ."
3751,yeah i guess . but maybe everyone can last in a gaem with only 11 minutes of play time
3752,"that fact is a bit odd , only 11 minutes of gameplay ? thats not much , noth much at all"
3753,"yeah i know , pretyy short . did you know engineers make more than football layers over their lifetime ?"
3754,"i didxnt know that but it does make sense , engineers work for a long time football players hav eshort careers ."
3755,yeqh that is true ? did you hear about that rule for the new oroleans cherleaders
3756,"i did , that ruel is so unfair and sexist , i hate it , 5he saints should change that immeditely ,"
3757,i gree htere completely . the worst part of it is that they hae to leave mied meal if the players walk in .
3758,"that is the worst part , did you hear about the tracking chips footballs have , ?"
3759,yeah i hope they can use that data like velocity and rotat5ion to make the game a little safer too
3760,"that would be a great use of the data , football can be a risky game full with imnjudies , a lot of the players end up with brqin damage"
3761,yeah exactly . did you know espn wona n emmy once ?
3762,"i didnt , why did espn win an emmy award ? i though emmys were only for the music business i guess i was mitaken"
3763,"i thought so too l, but they won it for the superiposed yellow .line ."
3764,"i guess that was a really important contribution to the game not sure if it deserved an emmy though ,"
3765,yeah not sure either . do you know what the highest score in footblal is ?
3766,"nom ayb e80 to 7 ? or1 20 to 3 ? i have no idea , im just guessing here ,"
3767,"it was actually 2220 . i wa smind blown ,g ood for georgia tech"
3768,do yo9u watch much football ?
3769,"i catch it when i can , mainy into college ball . how about you ?"
3770,i wzatch a litt4l of pro ball but nbot a ton . college ball always semed way more intebse fo me .
3771,"it does , i htink it is hbecaus4 you are playing solely for pride ."
3772,so true . plus they cang et away with fun stuff like illy pranks and not have the media in thekr face or huge fines .
3773,like painting a locker room pink . lol
3774,only in iowa i swear . speaking of college rivalries that one between their two colelge teams is crazy intense .
3775,resally ? i guesx you would have to be near it to know . here in florida uf and fsu can get pretty heatec .
3776,tha tis the gators and the seminoles right ?
3777,"yeah . i wnet to fsu so i am a bit investee , but honestly don tcare too much ."
3778,i'm hopimg that hte nfls hares some of the chip tech with college teams so we cna get more data about hits and ball spin . i really like hte math and science side of it .
3779,it is fascinating ikndeed i think it coulde be used to prevent injury took adn develop better safety equipment .
3780,itw ould be grat if they cou;d use that data to make helmets better to avoid concussion injuries .
3781,it hink gtey have started some work on things like 6hat with the placement of the inner padding .
3782,no9w if we can also get rid of the horrible attitudes 5owards cheerleaders on some teams it would be golden .
3783,that would be great ! i cant blame females for not running at the chance to play in the nfl with they way the treat the cheerleaders .
3784,i can't evne imagin4 trying out . tehnically they could but i bet the coaches would mak eit hard as possible for them to make it .
3785,"very true , the requirmeents kight be prohibitive themselves ."
3786,at least they aren't throwing them out because some male players show up . those poor nww orleans cheerleaders . i can't imagine putting up with that .
3787,i wonder if it is like that all around the league ?
3788,it seems like it depends on the team . i'm suret hat there is probably a reason for it but it seems super sexist . especially in this day and age .
3789,for real . i dont know whwt could have happeend to spur a rule like that .
3790,hwo knows . probably some scandal between a qb and a cheerleader . it always seems to be the qb in trouble .
3791,"it does , but then there are some like alex smith who just lead the hcarge and stick around to get a masters ."
3792,i think igt is amazing when they stay in co;lege instea dof just depending on a pro career . shows really forward thinking and plan for when football is nol onger an option .
3793,"it does , so many players go rboke 5 years after they retire , something like 60 percent"
3794,wow ghat seems crazy to me because you yhtink they make a;l this money but it is only for those few years so mosgj obs actually bring in more .
3795,"like being an enhgineer you will amke more in a lifetime , you have to work longer , but you make a lot more overall .?"
3796,makes sense to get that degree then . well it has eben nicet aplking to you .h ave a good evenign .
3797,h3y what do you think about dj moodre ? how good do you think he is ?
3798,i havent seen or hearf too much about him . hes up with washington right ?
3799,"yes he is , he is a wide receiver . and h normally works well with the quartebrack kyle lauletta , they play at the cole vfi3eld house by the way"
3800,wow . i think it is grat that there are a bunch of good up and coming players .
3801,"yes i agree , tbey definitely got a good draft last year , what do you think baoutg the nfl in general by thew ay ,h ow 9ften do you watch it"
3802,"i dotn watch too much , there is only 11 minutes of live action . i dont have time to spend 3 hours watching a game for 11 minutes ."
3803,"jnppe i agree .t hat's why i don't like sports because i think that they are really boring lersonally . on the otherh and though , whatd l you think about females playing for the nfl"
3804,"they dohnt treat cheerlearers wsll , so i dont imagine that theyw ould treat female players well either ."
3805,"no i agree with you . i think it's really dumb how a female cheerleader would have to lsave restaurfant if a male player walked inside , that seems very dated"
3806,"i treally does , i wonder why tha6 rule exists , or if it is even enfoereced ."
3807,"i hin kit is enforced unfortunately , do you know any engineers by the way ? aplarently an enginwer will make more over their lfetime thebn a professonal nfl or nba player which is incredibel to me"
3808,"i knkow few . none that are paid that6 highly , but it is cool that engineers hav etha tearning potential ."
3809,yup thats cool ! wha tdo you think aboit the team that painted their lcker room pink ?
3810,i think it is a bit childish and in a way toxic .
3811,yes i agree . i wonder if they did better or worse after they painted it taht color ? what do ou think about the patriots player who's neve rfumbed the ball ? he sounds amazing
3812,it is leaders like him and brady that really make that team whzat it is . i doutb anyone ele wille ver be able to do that .
3813,yep it takes a pecial pesrson to be that good . it also takes a special team to set a record for the modt points scored in a fotball game lol did you hear about that game
3814,"yeah , it is hard to believe . how can ytoue ven score that many 222 , that explains why the 0ther team had 0"
3815,"yep they must have been so good , georgia tech was definitely on their game that day"
3816,cumberland must have forgotten to get off the bus . . lol
3817,"yep tyat's certainly possible ! or they should have used the one player from the patriots who's never fumbled the ball , he would havge definitely helped cumb3rland t0o do better that day"
3818,fotball seems to just be increasing in popularity in the us . do you follow much of the games ?
3819,"i do , i jus5 watched the superbowl ons unday and l9ke the game , do you like it ?"
3820,i don't follow it too much . i am more of hockey fan . is there a lot of tams n the nfl ?
3821,"yeah there ar e2 teams in the fnl and there ar etwo difisions as well , 16 in each"
3822,i tdoesn't s4em like there uis a lot of actual gam eplay when you watch a football game . there seems to be a lot of talking and standing aroun dthen a few minutes of intense play .
3823,yeah there is a stat thats ays that az game has only about 11 minutes of gameplay i guess the rest is just ds or time wastjng .
3824,it seems like they play a lot of ads . i wonder how mucy of thawt money hoes to the teams and tghen the players . theys eem to have quite the high dlaaries if you look at their lifestyles .
3825,"im not sure asm ost players end up backrupt of with financial p4oblems , you know the nfl uses chips to track players movements and tl get interesting stats of the game ."
3826,"like they put chips in hte uniforms ? that is really neat . it would hbe cool to have a czmera in hte heljets to see the gameplay from the perspective of tnhe p,ayers ."
3827,"yeah they put chips under the shoulderpads of players and it would be cool , that is a great idea , the foo5ball also has a chip"
3828,that's awesome . i wonder if they ever include that info in the sports broadcasts that they do during adn after the games .
3829,"i guess its z possibiliyy , theres a lot of money in football , and the gameh as evolved since the first plyoff game back in 1932"
3830,the halftime shows and all the cheerleadinv certainly has . it is almost like a c9ncert when you go to a professioanl hgame now .
3831,"i agree , those have become really popular as well and move a lot of money , stadim stend to be really expensive ."
3832,i heard that it raises the taxes exorbitantly ahen they build a new stadium . i wonder kf sny of the ad money for tho0se sponsers goea to hte community or just to line tne pockets of the owners .
3833,"i can imagine , in texas there is as tadium that costed 60 million dollars , that sure is a lot of money ! and in american we ahve 14 of the 25 biggest stadiums in the world ."
3834,wow that is crazy to me for a szport that has such a short season . especially one that is played during the most voaltilw weather s4azson s. don't some states have outdoor stadiums ?
3835,"yeah some states do , but im guessing the donstruction is still heavy , flags at football stadiums are also really expensive like 50000 each"
3836,wow that seems really excesdive for5 just a fag . i get that it has to stand up to the elements but good grief ! no wonder tuignsa re so expensive when you go to a game .
3837,"yeah ig uess thatm akes a lot of sense now , tghey also weight like 1100 pounds so not only are they expebsive but they are really heavy as well , prfobably a good thing since it cant get stolen that easily"
3838,i can't imagin4 wanting to steal one of those but i' msure there are people out there that would think it is funny .
3839,do you watch vootball ?
3840,"i used to , i dont watch the nfl anymore after all of the kneeling and protesting"
3841,"nice , di you know that kellan moore is the only left handed qb ?"
3842,"yeah , hard to believe kellan moore is the only lefty ."
3843,i don't follow him that closely .
3844,did you know that the nfl has no written rule against female pkayers ?
3845,"yeah , i canb elieve it ."
3846,nfl using tracking chips to track ball velocity6 anjd rotatkon .
3847,interesting . i've never thought of something liekt hat .
3848,"how abot the rule that tells new orleans saintsc heerleaders they are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as players . if a player cojes in , theyh avet o leave ."
3849,i think all the clubs have sometghing loke that though . the redskins do too .
3850,i don't know that i aould listen to that rule if i was dealing with it .
3851,"yea h. iw ouldn't listen to the rule . none of the reds,isa did either ."
3852,if the average nfl game onlyh as on average 11 minutes of live gameplay ? hwy does it take all of sundzay afternoon to watch a couple of games ?
3853,they stand around and make play clals .
3854,which nfl team do you follow ? i used to follow the bronos and the bucs
3855,the redskins .
3856,are there still people trying to get them to change their name ?
3857,"probably , every year theydr o thzt . nevetr ends . i remember chris cooley marrird a cheerleader and they made a big stink about it . thats' why i ay all teams have this rule ."
3858,ygeah they wont be happy until that name is gone .
3859,it won't ever change . nobody in dc will let that happen . nicec hatting with you .
3860,sam darnold's professional footballc areer got off to a grea5 start against detroit . 2 td paswses in a 4817 win .
3861,do you remember sam darnodl well ?
3862,"yes , this is his first season in professional football , and he plays with the ny je5s ."
3863,what position didh e play3ed ?
3864,"darnold plays quarterback . his first pass was intercepted for a touchdown . after taht , he played great ."
3865,"he was the youngest to start the season , what was his age ?"
3866,"he is only 21 years old , that's the youngest qb to start a season opener since the arlnlfr merger ."
3867,"did he retire or waht happened , i heard of him but don't remember him ."
3868,"no , 2018 i shis first uyear . if he is successful , he could play well inyo the 2030's ."
3869,"o uwow , i am a nfl fan and didn't kmow that ."
3870,"on the first week of the season , tampa quarterback ryan fitzpatrick also had a fantastic game ."
3871,"if you had to chose , which of the two would you say better quarterback ?"
3872,"vitzpatrick js better today . we eill have to see how much darnold improves . a good start doesn't always mena a long , successful career ."
3873,"that true , if you was as coach , and your teakm about to enter thd superbowl , would you pick darnold's as yours tarting quarterback ?"
3874,"some qg's who had good etartsh ave done ell , newton , palmer , wentz , . others hav ebeen busts , griffin , ramsey , weinke , ."
3875,"yes , you are right . did he play for the jets in 2018 ?"
3876,"yes , darnold pplayed for the ny jets ."
3877,did you like the jets before they got eliminate dfrom th elayof f?
3878,the jets did play poorly this year . here's an odd fact about another nfl rookie qb . baker mayfiel donce considered pursuing professiojal egaming a sa career .
3879,"yes , most of their games wqere close . i thought that they would have made the playoff , i don't know what wet wrong ."
3880,the jets simply weren't a good football team this year .
3881,hello do you like foobtall ?
3882,not so much . . . are you q bigf an of football yourself ?
3883,"not feally . i hardly watch anymore , sometimes if the 49ers play ."
3884,quartebracks are one of the most popular players for football it seems . i cannot name any off thw top of my head though . can you ?
3885,"tom brady , eli manning , joe montfnaa , alex smit . htose last 2 arent curent lol"
3886,"i think it's interes6ing that matt patricia is a coach for football but yer he is also a rocket scientist ; really , how does he have time for football ?"
3887,maybe it pays better lol
3888,that woul dmake my day if i learned football would be a more lucrative proession than rocket scientis5 . what is thew world coming to ?
3889,"i kow right . i would rather be a rocket scientist though , i dont want to be costrantly injured pol"
3890,thqt's true . . . although coacehs and owners seem to be in the permanent safe zoen ! did you know that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's football team ?
3891,thas cool k i wonder if it was any good lol
3892,"wel l, that football team is one of the luciest around to be involved with snoop dogg . i don't think they needded to do much fundraising fore quipemnt at that school !"
3893,i hear the former funning back of the patriots never fumbled the ball benjarvus greenellis .
3894,wow a football player that never fumbles the ball ; 5hat sounds like somd sor tof footblal god . is he a quarterback ?
3895,"running back . not a quarter back . i know right , really impressive , io wonder why this guy isny more well known ."
3896,"running back , quarterbac k, tight end . thosw are about the only football positions i knw . . .t he last one sounds p5etty funny , actually ."
3897,"i dont know mamy either , only the common ones . espn wo nan emmy for the creation of the yellow line that tells you where there is a first down ."
3898,"even as hard as they try l in football or any other zport it can be hard to call . there is always humsan error . differences of opinion , too , i bet . . ."
3899,i recently read that the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback .
3900,"was that so the football players on the other team or other people couldn't see wha the quarterbak was singing ? that's very clever , if so !"
3901,"it doesnt go into detail but yeah i assume so , verys art of them and also awesome to accomodate a deat quarterback ."
3902,good morninh ! cool . . . love talking national football league !
3903,hey the4re . yes the nfl is an awesome organization . i watch the super bowl this year it was held on th efirst sunday un february . but it wasn' tthat good of a gme i thought .
3904,"i like defensive games . i didn't watch it for the first time because i was protesting how the new orleans saints were scrdewed by hte officials . but , that' me . . ."
3905,yeah that was one of the worst no calls i have evef seen . truly terrible . ndl uees tracking cfhips and pla7er sshoulder pads but they can't even review a call ? not ok .
3906,"yep . . . . i don't know if you've been watching any alliance of football gmaes , but they have a referee on camera thats' supposed to catch a lot of those callls . i hope the antional footvlal league b49ngs that same approach to the games ."
3907,yeah i definitely think the nfl should adopt that . they have no writenr ule against feamle players so ehy not have a referee on camera too .
3908,"agreed . i'm glad that jacksonville is finally goign to ge trid of blake bortles with that philly qb , cna't remekber his name , . they shoudl be a lot betterw ith uim ."
3909,yeah i agree wiht you there . i remember the forme5 patriots running back green ellis he never once fumbled the football .
3910,"he was good . strnage he didn't last long with the patriots . but , th3ey also say in th eafc east that sam darnold looke dgood at qb , but i think baker mayfield was better for my team , the browns , . we fi9nally have a quarterback ."
3911,i hope your team does well in the future you guys definitely deserve it . i am also glad bake rmayfield didn't pursue his competitiveg aming dream . he makes a better footbal lplayer i think .
3912,"yes , we are very excited about baker mayfield at quarterback . the cleveland browns hav ebeen so pitiful for so many years . we have 21 6dar ol kids that don't even know we ever had a good tesm ;"
3913,yeahw ell hopefully thaft will changel ol . sometimes i forget that there aree 32 teams in the nfl because we only ehar abou tthe same teams every year .
3914,"if i have to hear the enwe ngland patriots name on4e more time , i9'j gonna barf ! i hate that they are the one football team that are int he playoffs every fang year . uggh !"
3915,i know it is very annoying . i really wish they didn't win thes uper bowl again . i would've really like to see the b3w orlreans saints win this year .
3916,"agreed . and that's why6 i didn't wathc it for the first time ever . i awas undrr protest , lo l. . . then again , i did bet on the pats to win ,"
3917,well it wasx a smart be tand i hope it paid off for yku . it's kind of interestin gthat the new orleans saints cheerleaders can't be at the same restaurant as zny nfl player .
3918,probably a good idew . . . . lol . . . . . cheerleaders are th elast thing a national football league player need sto see when trying to concentrate on football . those gals are too gorgeous !
3919,i com;letely agree with you . sometimes i would ratuer watch the in the game . sudprisingly thoug hthe aversage lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher tha nthe average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player .
3920,"wll , i'm glad they do ! engineers deserv emore money tha na sporyts player in baseball or thd national foofball league ."
3921,yeah i agre with you . the football players just get injured too pten which is surprising beczuse the3re's actually only 1q minutes of lve gameplay per game .
3922,"yep ! well , i'd like to leep talking football with ya . but , i'd better get going . great chatting with you and aould like to ro it again . . . . you take care now and have a grea tday !"
3923,do you watch football ?
3924,i sure do . snoop dogg once wrote a song for his son's team
3925,wow cool . u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
3926,i wonde rif that is supposed to have some impact on them
3927,i wonder too . bolwers made more than football players in the 60s
3928,3ow cool . the coaches are the highest paid ever though in the stsates
3929,i bet . do you know what theh ighsst college football score is ?
3930,"i am not sure , whwat game was that ?"
3931,"it was georgia tech and cumberland , 2220"
3932,wow what a scre . did you know kellan moore ise the only left handed qb in the4 nfl ?
3933,cool . do you like brady ?
3934,"i like him , he is good . do you know brad johnson ?"
3935,i have heard of him . rbady was a backup qb in high school
3936,wow a backup ? brad is the only guy to have thrown imslef a touchdown gall
3937,wow i did not know that was even possible
3938,me either . onlyt wo africanamerican players habe won the sperbowl
3939,wow . baker mayfield wantef to be a game player originally
3940,wow . did you know the nfl is using trackinfg chips now ?
3941,cool what for ? waht are they collecting there ?
3942,htey are collecting velocity and rotation and a bunch of other stuff
3943,"oh i see , can rhey use that to make the bgame safer too ?"
3944,do you follow the nfl ? the la chargers lost to the broncos 2322 last week to win the afc conference .
3945,"hello , no i cdidn't . you keep up with football a lot ?"
3946,not really ? i prefer watching the band ! but some fu facfts about fpotyballa re that the average lifetime eanrings of an engineer are more than th eaverage nfl player and mlb player .
3947,"i read fhat to crazy ! nfl uses tracking chips embesdded in players shoulder padd to record a players every move oh the field . they are also located inside footballs tt rack : velocity , rotation , ball speed and locat8on ."
3948,that is 3way too much form e ! te huddle wasc reated for american football when a deaf qurterback didn't want to gibe away hand signals
3949,that's really considerate !
3950,in the 60s' top vowlers actually made two times the amount as top football stars
3951,"maybe bowling was much more popular back then . matt patricia is the ony rockety sciwntist coaching in the nfl . befofre coaching , he was a working aeronauticval engibeer who graduated from rpi : a school whose fight song includes ' sin ' , ' cosine ' and ' tangent ' , as well as six digits of pi ."
3952,smart guy ! i wonder f he vosited hte pink univ of iowa college football locker room
3953,"lol must be some sort of strategy or something ,"
3954,espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing thd first down line for american football games . that is dool !
3955,"yeah ! tuhe first nfl playofc game was played in 1932 on an 80yard long dirt field inside chicago stadium , then home to the nhl blackhawks ."
3956,therew as a patriot footabl lplayer named greenellis who never fumbld the football . i guess they should pass to him !
3957,"nice , i wonder why thatg uy isn't that popula r ,never heard of him ."
3958,not sure . the highest scoring gam racked up 222 point and the other team unfortunately got 0 when georgia tech won over cumberland .
3959,wow !s noop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school footballt eam .
3960,alex smith took so many ap tests in high school hta he went in as a juniord to college .
3961,"wow that's impressive ! tjhose humungous americanf lags at football stadiums weigh 1 , 100 pounds and cost 50 , 000 to make"
3962,tgat's huge ! arizona is apparently doing qorse i nscoring than predicted for football .
3963,that's unfortunate .1 4 of tne world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college foobtapll teams .
3964,"i wonder if public o private ? i guess i may be funding them ! better go wqat hsome football : ,"
3965,i didnt know there was navy football as well
3966,there seems to be a leagu efore verything
3967,"i agree , i wonder if navy football is any good , seems like its really competitive"
3968,there seems to be an oifficial governing body so it seem squite proffesional .
3969,"it does seem taht way , theres different teams like the midshipmen , seems like they have still chance to win the tournameht"
3970,i did not en know the quarter back was classed as an offensive player .
3971,it does make sense sinse they are behnd the offensive lins and only participate in offnsive plays
3972,its strange thatc heereladers are required to leav eif a player enters a resturant it seems an outdated concept .
3973,"that is a terrible rule , the saints are a sexist team"
3974,but there are no rules against women playing int he nfl
3975,no rules agaisnt that really ?
3976,i wonder how strict the requirements ar end if an6 women try .
3977,they must be really strict .
3978,have you ever seen the data from the trackers ?
3979,"no , i havent what about 6you ? it might be interesting thlugh , all kkinds of data"
3980,"i dont follow football , bt its interesting to knowa n engineer has better earning potential than a football player ."
3981,"well thats because they wlrk for a lot more years than a footall players , foorball players uually retire at age 4 0or s"
3982,i bet th4 engieners body will be in better shape as welp
3983,"yeah and with a better brain function , mzany pro foobtall players end up with terrible injuries or braind damage , in some cases both"
3984,"htat is bad , bt i was aslos uprised to know that an average live gameplay is only 11 minutes"
3985,"only 1q1 minutes ! that seems ike a scam ,"
3986,they say it's time to stop sleepinjg on the chargers . what do you think ?
3987,"kansas city ? they had ag ood 0218 season , didn't they ?"
3988,"los angeles chartger's had a8 3 season . they say they should have a cdefinitive shot at the super bowlt his year , what do you think ?"
3989,"theyd idn't make i to the super bowl . don't know how close they cmae , do you ?"
3990,out of the thirty two teams they are one that did not . the chargers have made the play offs 6 times .
3991,that's a solid decord . the la rams go tythe spotlight ; guess hte chargers have been overlooked . wo are their star players ?
3992,good question ! you kjow th eiowa university lockrr room is painted pin for the vusitors .
3993,fun colleg4e footblal fact ! do you have a fav . college or nfrl team ?
3994,well it use to be green bay but i don't get to watch sports much anymore so i always just hope for a good game when i do .
3995,packers . bret favre . remember those great teams well . used to never miss vikings or green bay gmaes ! what makes a good game for you ?
3996,"great palys ,f air calls and strong defense . how abou tyou ? another fun ract top bowlers in the 60's made more than top nfl players did ."
3997,uheard tbhat . fair calls : wel lsaid ! vikings used to pride thmeselves on defense . great plays makes me think o fthe qb . was facvde your favorite ?
3998,"through the yearzb ut he's up there with the greats , montana , 4lway and spme of the other's . how was your favorite ?"
3999,"have to say tom brady , but his jv football coach would not agree . jv team lost every game , an dnever scoed a td . brady as backupq b sat sidelined ; coach never put the kid un a game ! hasn't brady's careet changed since then ? ?"
4000,so very very much . h3's got a bunch of rings and tey just won this years super blwl . plus i heard he wrote a book .
4001,"6 supe rbowl rings now , all with ne and coach belichik . brady has written a book ; some call it a kind of football ' bible ' . he is very serious , almost religious ,a bout commitment to the game . i'm suspicious of that kind of fervor . . . how about you ?"
4002,well not the ferco rbut wyat i'm hsaring about him and this book givesm e pause . apparently there is a degres about bill that syates in bill we tdust and some call his book a little cultist .
4003,"yes , have read abou6 trhat . the patriot fans can be pretty ' faithful ' to their team ;. jees ! football is meant to be about passing , kickign balls and scoring td , field goasl , etc . it's a sport , not a religion , don't you think ?"
4004,i agree 100 percent too much credence is placed on the wrong things . hey did you hear about espn's emmy award ?
4005,"yes , the one they won years ago for creating that superimposed yellow line on the field htat shows viewers how many yards the offensive has to go to get a 1st down ? s9 used to it now , i can't picture watching a game without it ! but somebody created it ."
4006,"yeah it made watching the game taht much less frustrating , lol ! you know that if you are a new orleans cheerleader and you are eating at a restwurwant and a playere comes int hen you have to leave . i think that's kind of sexist . well it was nice catting with you !"
4007,"will leave yo7 w o5 a thought from my dad , who coached hs footba.l for 41 yrs : his fav . thign was to watch fervent boys run up the field in th ewrong direction ; what he hatex most was that boy wouldn't report injuries to hi m. they wanted so badly to keep p;laying . good chat . cheers !"
4008,you too mate !
4009,give her watch high schoo lfootball ? apparently gonzaga and st john's are in the top 20 now
4010,does gonzaga play quartebrack for st john s?
4011,"ji think gonzaga is a team , but i'm not 100 percent sure i don't follow high school football that much , i only watched a local gaem when my nephew is playing l0ol"
4012,i see . then you probably know i do not watch high school football ! i really don't een watch the nfl . do you ?
4013,"no i dojn't wtch the nfl either ; i do like tom brady thouh , that's the only thing i know is that he's really good lol"
4014,i hear that ruby is a variaqtion of football . it's even literally called rugby fvootball in place s.
4015,yes i think you're right . i only like american football though . thry also have gaelic fotball and canadian footall
4016,"sorry , meant rugby , not ruby ! i hear some of the stadiums have flags that weigh over ha,f a ton . i wonder if thy've evef faleln ?"
4017,yeah i would be so scared if i saw rhat flag falling on top of me lol . did yo ever hear about tuhe highest scoring footbalo game of all time ?
4018,"i didn't , was it a very high score ? i know it's a hugh price 5o build a football stadium . i'v eheard just a hig hschool one can be sixt7y million !"
4019,wow that's insane ! you think tha ta high school team does not need a football stadium that complex . did you know that in the 60s top bowl3rs amde more than top football player sthough ?
4020,"i like bowling more than playing football . one reason is that i liek how you can practice alone bevcausef or football it's always teamwork , but bowling can be done alone ."
4021,yes i agree . it's also a lot less work to get a team together lol . what do you think about espn winning an emmy for the yellow line on tv ?
4022,"ig 8ess it's a good idea , but i'm not sure if it was the bewst . i agree that school sspend too much on elaborate stadiums . put of the 25 largest stadiums in the world , 14 are at american colleges . i wonder what their food is like ?"
4023,"yes i'm curious too . i'm also curious why the university of iowa paint6ed a locker room pink , i wonder 9f they thought it would help or hur ttehm"
4024,"i think th3y did it for just a joke , or i hope so . i know snoop dogg has a son that playas football ? have you ever seen him play ?"
4025,"no ih asven't seen him play . the song ne made is really interesting though , you should look it up on youtube"
4026,"i haven't hear dit , i will ! i think qusrterbacks tend to be popular players in football , although i'm not ven sure what theyu do ."
4027,"yes quaeterbac sare the oens that touch the ball the most and also throw it to other plsyers , baker mayfield is one of the most famous ons"
4028,"ive hesrd 6hat kellan moore is a famouw quarterback in hte nfl knownf or being left handee . he's the only one like that , it seems ."
4029,"yes yo7're right . he's very talenmted too , baker mayfield though played this video game called halo 3 bavck when he was in college , he was unstoppable at that gam e ,i was also really good at it too lol"
4030,hello do you like watching football ?
4031,"i love football , the eagles are my team !"
4032,"awesome . they won the 201 8super bowl . i don't really know a lot about foo5tball or sports in general , though ."
4033,"they sure did , that was one of rhe happiest moments of my life !"
4034,wws that their first super bowl win ?
4035,"yes , they had never won unftil that year , tha tis what kade it so special !"
4036,cool who did they play agaist .
4037,"they played against the new england patrots , whi lot to hte gints twice in the 2000s , theya re not so great anyjore though !"
4038,i guess not ! i found it interesting tok learn that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
4039,"that is true , it is very strechted out , bu tthe eagles won in fatnastic style , htey added new player like jaayi and darby who helped win"
4040,"it looks like they added quite a few new playerz , like toreey smith and patrick rovinson ."
4041,"yes , abd they arsb oth gone now , the nfl movezs very quicly !"
4042,"they didn't stay long . did they ,ove to nee teams ? i know they make a lot of money inm the nfl ."
4043,"yes , some players use that superbowl as a cance to improve hteir value and worth . blount also left the team ., and he had wopn the year before thayt"
4044,are you looking forward to seeing what the team does this year '
4045,"we have a shot at the playoffs , but many players are injured like clement , barnett and darby are injured ,a nd tha5 makes it tough to win"
4046,"yeah , i bet . injuries probably happen a lot i nfootball ."
4047,"they do k it is partially why the giants collapsed this year , as well as the redskins"
4048,well it was nice talking to you even though i don't know a lot about football !
4049,"you as well . i tis an interestign sport , there is a lot ofn uance to it"

4059,yes they are not allowed to ea tin the same place as the players
4060,yeah and they also have to eave mid meal if they walk in
4061,"so sexist , i really think it needs to go"
4062,i agree di you hear they are using chips on hte players now
4063,yes tehy are tracking stuff like vrlocity and rotation and such
4064,i hope they can use that to make the game safer somehow
4065,yeah . do you like brady ?
4066,i do . he was a abck up qb in high school
4067,yeah and they did not start hi even when they were not doing well

4076,i do not have a favorite one . how aboyt you ? i liek that they have no rule against woma nwho can also play in the nf; ?
4077,"yeah i think that is super cool , i really want a female player to make a team and play and thef ield soon . i think it would be so great for all the young girls into sports . and i follow the packers ."
4078,"yeah , i mean even the lpcker room for university of iowa players was pin ."
4079,yeah isn't that hilarious . i wonder how they got the ok for that to get painted in the first place .
4080,yeah i wonder too . in thes ixties top bowlers made twise as much as football plauyers ?
4081,"that is so funny , oh if i could have a choice to do it again , i would be a top bowler in the 60's . i woul dhave the life then ."
4082,yes so true . did you know that espn once won an emmy ?
4083,yeah i hea4d they won it years back when th4ey came out with the yellow line ahown for the first down line .
4084,that is so interesting . the highest score in foobtall was scored when gerogia defeated cumberland .
4085,wasn't it a crazy sc9re of over 2000 ? i think i read about yhat one rtime .
4086,yeah that is truly crazy . a former patriots rb never fubled the football in his nfl dareer .
4087,"i heard that . what was his name , i don' tremember bht know he played for the patriots ."
4088,his name waw benjarvus greenellis . prett7 intereating .
4089,yeah that is amazing . do you knoww hen the first nfl playoff game was held ?
4090,no i do not know that . do you ?
4091,"it was way back in 1932 ! in chicag stadium , and the field was basically dirt and only 8 0yards long . it was the same place the blackhawks played !"
4092,oh wow ith as been around for so long . it wa snice chatting with you .
4093,are you watching the superbowl this year ? wokuldnt it be interestingt o see a wlman ply for either team .
4094,"i'll probably watch it . are you ? you know , teh nfl doesn't have any rules against a woman olaying ."
4095,"yeah i just found about that tough i dont we will ever see one at a pro level , i also didnt know tyhe average gmae play is 11 minutes"
4096,"id idn't know that either . next game i'm going to watch to see ift hat is true . i do know , though , that there is only 16 regular season games ."
4097,"realy only 16 thoughtt here were more games , so anyway whats your favoritw football position ?"
4098,"well , there is if you count playoffs nad prezseason . oh , and each time ahs a bye week . my favoriye position is eitehr 1quarterback or wide receiver . you ?"
4099,"mine is runnjngback , its been my favorite since i saw benjarvus greenellis play , so much talent ."
4100,"i've never heard of him . i'm old school and have to amit taht my favorite running abckl was tony dorsett bacl in the day . but now , as far as talent goes , there's some good players out there . baker mayfield for example . he's so talneted at stuff he could even do professiobal video game playing !"
4101,"yeah i know who mayfield is , he is talented i heard he was pretty good at halo back in college ."
4102,yep . i like multifaceted players . alex sith for example is reporte dto be very msart . he was working on a master's degree before being drafted ?.
4103,"wow , i guess he is one of the few football players with a masters degree , that is admirable ."
4104,"i thino so too . foobtall can be inspirin glike that . i mean , tom brady wqs a second string quarterback in high school and now look !"
4105,"i bet his coach didnt think he would get so far , his been ina lmost every superbowl since 2002"
4106,i agree . i wonderw hat will happen with the patriots when he rtires . the quarterback is th eleader of the team and they don't seem to have a good replacement in place .
4107,"i know , the qb is so influential hat he touches the ball in every play , they are going to have a hard time fidning a good replacement , not sure how the second string qb i right now ."
4108,"knowing that , teams need really good quart6erbacks . did you know taht kellan moore is the only left hsnded one ?"
4109,"i didnt know that , football sure is a nice sport , there are many crasy stat slike the one in which georgia techd efeated another team by 222 points"
4110,that is crazy ! i would ave loved to see that game ! i bet neither geam had any ddfesne at qall !
4111,"yeah , or the other team was probably full with blind peopls ."
4112,maybe the home team should have tried o psych their opponent out liket he university of iowa does . they have the visitora locker room pained pink .
4113,yeah that can certainly demoralize a team .
4114,do you know who baker mayfiedl; is ?
4115,i'm not sure if i do .
4116,"he is a quarterback , he used to play for the redskins and now is pr4eparing for the seniokr bowl"
4117,"oh , okay . i love teh game off ootball , although i find it iodd that the nfl has no written rulea gainst female players ."
4118,theres no written rule really ? i wonder if well ever see a femal player then
4119,"well , we migfht . as long as a female can meet league eligibility requirements , she is free to play ."
4120,"great maybe some day , did you hear about those tracking chips the fnl use ? amazingt how much the game ha sgrown over hte years"
4121,"yes , o've heard the fnl uses the chips in players shoulder pads to record a poayers every move on the field ."
4122,"i think thats intersting , tehy use it to track their position and then they also place the chips on the footballs and all kids of interestin stats are puleld from them"
4123,well then i guess they can really hold the players accountagld for how they are playign and also make some really good plans too .
4124,i agree so did you hear about the rule fhe aaints have aainst cheerleaders in their team ?
4125,"yes ! it sounds completely sexist to me . i can not imagine being at a pladce eating as a ceerleader , hving a player walk ibn , ad having to get up and leave without finishung my meal !"
4126,"i kwow right , aving to walk away would be humiliating pecially if you are with friends and family , humilia5ing ah dtotally nfair"
4127,i agree . seems dated . can you believe thst the average lifetimee arnings of an engineer is higher than that of an nfl player ?
4128,"that actually make s4nse , most players have a carreer o f20 years amd then enginneers work for 40 years or even nmore"
4129,"well , yes . i'm not sure which caree ri'd like better . it would be nice to have the nfl perks , that's for sure ."
4130,yeah but the ntheres are all the injuries associated with the game and the brain damage
4131,"well , yeah , that is ad rawback . even top bowlers in the 1960's made twice as much as top footbal stars . i think i'dr ather bowl !"
4132,"i like bowling , it zseems like a safe5 game not a lpt of room for injuries , well bowlers make a lot less now"
4133,yes . i'm sure they still make better money than a 95 though . they hav eto eb talented thouhg . like formner patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the fb in his nfl career !
4134,"i have to google that like right now ,h e never flumbled the ball ? wow , anyways its been great chatting with you i feel lot smarter now"
4135,"no , enver in his xareer ! nive chnatting with you a sell ."
4136,"im googlij gthat for sure seems unreal , thanksf or all bye ."
4137,hey how ar you ? you watch the nfl at all ?
4138,"yes i am a real nfl fan , i try to watch most gajes ."
4139,"right on , you a ravens fan by chance ? or you like another tezm ?"
4140,"teh ravens is pretty goo d, but i like the pittsburgh steelers , even though tehy aren't a come from behind team ."
4141,"oh man , i'm sorry you're a sfeelers fan lol . antonio brown and le;veo nbell gone in a year ?"
4142,"that's what i am thinking about , but that always been my team , they do need better players , they seesm to fall everytime against a good team like new ebngland ."
4143,"true , juju smithschuster and jaems conner afe both special players too ,e vne if they only play for 11 minutes thr5ouhgout the gqmke ."
4144,do you actually believe that a our quarter game only 11 minutes of live plays ?
4145,"i could maybe see that , i thought it'd be a lot lese to be honest . if we're just talking about from snap to whistle . what do you think ?"
4146,"i would say no way , including quarterback time , run timje , field goal time , it almost takes the average person 11 mijnutes to enjoy a nice sinner' just my ooinion ."
4147,"haha for sure , i think it's just between the whistles hough right . like a fg would start when the ball is snapped and edn when the whisle is blown , so like 5 seconds ? it'd be interesting to see the way they cme up witht hat stat ."
4148,"i woul dagree with that , what do you think aboutw omen in th enfl , do you thnk th eratigs will drop to a low ?"
4149,"not sure , if they can keep up that would be cool to see , i just don't see it happenjng anytim esoon , what do you think ?"
4150,"i am not trying to be negative , but i don' tsee it either , ebcause it would be hard to fidn a 250 to 300lbs player hitting a woman head on , i can't see that happening ."
4151,"true , maybe as a kicker or punter sometime ? i don't know who would 5eally want to p;ay in the nfl anyways . alex smith is pretty smart too , took a lot of ap tests in high school"
4152,"that's true , i would be upset if i play the fnl pool and a player let another player run by and make a touch down just because she's a woman ."
4153,"true , i could see that . how much did juniperro seria hs refret not playing tom brady ?"
4154,"wow , i bet he still regret it , xid you know in 1961g 3eorgia tech defeated vcumberland 2q20 ? i never heard of cumbelrand , have you ?"
4155,"i have not , they're in georgia though i'd assume right ? they probably shut downh the school aftert hat game haha ."
4156,"hahaha , they probably did , becaus ei pretty sure they most havef ired the coach . i didn't know ,ellan moote is the only ,eft hand in then fl ."
4157,"for sure , i wonder whuy he was hte only one . i'mg oing to taek off though , take care and great chat !"
4158,hi ! do yoj like footall ?
4159,hi . yes i do . i especially like americsn football . do you ?
4160,i'm not thazt big of a fan . i did fin it int4resting thatt here is onpy one left6 handed qb in the nfl
4161,that is interesting . another interesting fact is that the huddle was started because of a deaf quarterback .
4162,that's very interesting ! the junipero serra hig hshcool had such a bad year they failed to even scor ea touchdown .
4163,i thonk i've heard of them before . during that year wasn't their sgartingq usarterbzck tom brady ?
4164,"actuaplly , he was thdir backup . they never played him !"
4165,that's right ! he was the backup . he's been a starter for so long now 9 just automatically said it ll ! have you heard of baker maycfield before ?
4166,"yeah , i have heard the name but i don't know much about him ."
4167,he was the starting quarterback for the hunuversity of oklahoma . word is he's not only great at football but aslo at video gmaes . he's so good hec onsidered becoming a professionalg amer .
4168,that's cool . do you know who alex smith s ?
4169,his name sounds fmailiar . isn't he a professional quarterback too ?
4170,"yes , and he's smart . he earned his bachelo'rs degree in 2 years nf got his masters before becoming the first pick in 2005 draft"
4171,"qow ! that is ipressive ! good for him ! he must have worked very hard in school . i mean , qua4rterbacks touch the ball for practical.y every offemsivr play so you know he was busy with footvalla nd to stilld o so great academically is fantastic ."
4172,no doubt ! i wonder if hr every plzyed iowa in college . their visitor's locker room is pink !
4173,"that's funny . i guess that school has a good sense of humor . speaking of schools , have you heard of georgia tech ?"
4174,i have heard of them . i'mn guessing they have a good team ?
4175,"not sure ift hey do now , but bakc in 1916 tuey did . they zcored the most ppints ever in a game . they veat cumbelrand 2220 ."
4176,"wow , that's quyite a thumping ! could you imagine being on the losing sid eof that game ?"
4177,i would feel awful . that bad of a beating would probabky make ms highly consider quitting playing . i can't help but wonder though why they just didn? tcall the gqm ea some point .
4178,i totally agree . great chat ! have a good one !
4179,"hi there ! looking forward to chat with you ! ; k,"
4180,"you too brah . do you watch football ? the nfl has 3 2teams , the ny giants are my favorite team"
4181,"i don'5 really watch . . . i'm from europe we watch football , soccer , ; , giants huh ? where you're from ? all my neighbors are cheering for giants ; ,"
4182,"i'm from connecticut , right nsxt to ny . we don't have any of the 16 teams fromt he nfc or afc in my state unfortunately"
4183,"ahh , i'm fron pong island ny , so i guess we'ren e8ghbors ; ,"
4184,i wonde rif european footall uses tracking chips lik ehow the nfl embeds the into shoulder pads
4185,"yeah i don't think so ; , i mean , i've never heard about that . i wonder what's the point . . ."
4186,"i guess the nfl uses fthemt o track the players movementx and they also have them in the ball to treack velocity , rotation , speed , and location"
4187,"holy crap , so much data for running with th3eb all and passing it from time to time . . . : , hey i heard that tge hihgest score in football was 2220 ? i sthat really high ?"
4188,usually in the pros once you break into the 40s its consider really high . in college therew ill be a game once in a while that breaks inhto the 60's or 70s
4189,what . . . so how the hell did they do hat ? 222 ?t hat's like 4 times bigger score than that . . .
4190,"yea , it must of been the best team in college football at the time facing another college that's team had the skill equivalent of a high schoopl team"
4191,are matches like that entertaining tow atch ? soccr matches are really exciting even wirth score 00
4192,"if the gam4s ar elcose ins core they tend to fun to watch , if it's onesided and ypu're not a fan of the high scoring team then no , that's why i don't really like college football 90 percent of the games aren't competitive"
4193,"i s4e ,. . . int he 1960's top bowlers made twice a smuch as top football stars was bowling that popular in usa ?"
4194,"not really , back in the 60s football wasnt' as popular and there was no unions , players during he offseason worked regular job"
4195,"ahh , ok . . . hey wha's up with those pink lockee rooms in university of iowa's ? did youh ear about that ?"
4196,hjead gsmes i guess . did you know 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american colleg efootbal lteams ?
4197,probably huge budget stand sbehind it . . . that's why it's also so popular . . .
4198,"yea , kinda a shame sports are more important tha nacademics , the highest paid across all u . s . department of defens eemployees are three football coaches of the service branch teams ."
4199,"i agree , bu tit was always like that . . . entertainment above all whatever brings more profit . . . hey , it was really nicec hattign with you !"
4200,you too k hace a good one
4201,are you familiar with college footballs ?
4202,"ehllo , actually more familiar with the fl"
4203,"me too . so , why are quarterbacks so important ?"
4204,the are very very important because thye re teh leaders of the offensive team
4205,do they really make calls during huddlee ? i thought coaches do those .
4206,"it looks .ke that is the way ! well and we are getting close to the superbowl , ghow you like that ?"
4207,"i a,m goin gto watch superbowl on tv ."
4208,me too ! did you know there is aw crazy rules for tbhe new orleans saintsc heereladers ?
4209,no id on't . please tell me about it .
4210,the can't eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player !
4211,"i just read about , after you mentioned it , . what is hte reason for htat ?"
4212,"i thinkt hat makes no sense , i the cheerleader is already eating there , an a player comes in , they hafe to leave . i do not think there is a valid reason ."
4213,is it legal ? it is discrimination . i 5hink the cheerleaders shoudl stay if they are there before pklayers .
4214,i totlaly agree with you . and at least the nfl has no rule against female players .
4215,i heard about that . no female player has eben interestd in jlining the nfl so far .
4216,if a woman wanted and met the requirements she could get in but i doutb it woudl happen anytime soon .
4217,i agree with you . do you know tha nfl places chips in players shoulers pads ?
4218,"yes , i heard something about it ! tell me mor4"
4219,the league wants to know the players' each mov eon the field .
4220,"we enjoy the game so much , but did you know how much is actually avtual play time ?"
4221,"no . pleas etell me sbou tit . also , who do you think will win the superbowl ?"
4222,"just 11 minutes , we will jusf wait and see . it was a pleasure talking to you !"
4223,hey ! how's i goig ? do you l9ke football ?
4224,yes j do . . . very uch ! do you ?
4225,"i do , wha tdo you think about baker mayfield ?"
4226,he seemse 0retty good so far ! wo's you're favorite teajm ou6t th e32 teams in 6he nfl ?
4227,"i'm a new orleans saints fwn myself ,h iw about you ?"
4228,that's cool . . . i like them . . . although payton's faces are pretty funny ! i am an eagles fan .
4229,"yeah th4y are . i like the eagles too , there's been a lot of good players coem through there ."
4230,yeah . . . be nice to have a consistent quarterback ! i cant' believe kellen moore is he only left haded1 b !
4231,i can't either . i find that odd . i guess the last quarterbsck i knew of in the leazgue was timt ebow .
4232,so i wonder when we will see a female player in the nfl ?
4233,"i'm not sure , i' surprjsed there hasn't been one since there's no rule against it ."
4234,so true ! what position you think she will play ?
4235,i'm not sure . i could se3 q defensive back or something .
4236,i was thinkingm ore like a kicker .
4237,that would work too . i w9uld just hope they would get treated better than the cheerleaders . the sajnt's chserleaders are forbidden from eatin at the same restaurant as any nfl player .
4238,crazy isn ; t it ? you ever heard of that before being a saints fan ?
4239,"i had not , it's pretty horrible . even if theg are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , they hafe to leave . that is crazy to me !"
4240,extremsly unfair . . . they need to hcang ethat rule . . . i'ts very rude !
4241,i agree they do9 . the game has changed so much in the nfl . in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top nfl stars . now i'm sure that's reversed tenfold .
4242,oh yea h. . . for sure ! how about we sit around for 3 hjours wa6cuhing a game for only 11 total minutes of live gameplay . . . we muct be craz !
4243,"i know right ! ic an't believe it ! well i have to run , it was nice chatting with you . i hope you have a good night !"
4244,hi ! are you a football fan ?
4245,yeah i loe football how bo7t ou .
4246,"i watch more college than the nfl , buy yes i am ."
4247,i dont watch much college 0ther than the mountaineers every now and then . im a big steelers fan o i watch them every week .
4248,"i watch fsu and sdly i grew up a dolphins fan , so there is no hope there . lol"
4249,lol .a s logn as you pick a team and srick with them . i hate it when somebody just goes with a team just cause they ared oing well .
4250,"yeah , not a fair weatger fan . i woulc stick by my team even if they er elosing by 222 . like the highest scoring gaem ever ."
4251,"that would be emberrasing to lose by that mufch , but i would still stick with them as well ."
4252,it is more embarrzssing on howt hes aints treat hteir cheereaders in my opinion .
4253,yeah i read that to . that isr ediculous .
4254,in the 60's nfl stars werent making as much so thir egos probably werent as big .
4255,"i know right . if bowlerw are makign more than you are , i dont think you can get to big of a head on your shoulders . lol ."
4256,"i cant even name 1 professional bowler , ever ."
4257,me eithwr . i just think o fthat movie with woody harrelson . i think it wcup or somethign like that . it also as tin
4258,kingpin ? that is the one i think of .
4259,yeah tha5t might be it . lol . brings abck memories .
4260,"yuo . a time before that yellow line , that espn won ahn emmy for . lol"
4261,well that yellow line is prettyawesome if you ask me .
4262,"i totally agree , i dont know how to watch without it . its just not the same ."
4263,nope . it really give you a new perspective . you can physically see where we need to get to . when a guy stretches out you get to make a judgement on th espot whether he got it or not . love it .
4264,did you know there is only 1 left handed qb int he nfl ?
4265,i didnt know that actually . i figured there woudl be a least a f3w . good chat though ttyl .
4266,"how's it going , are uou a football fan ? it's amazing benjarvus gr4enellisa never fumbled in his career"
4267,he was a graet palyer he used to play for the patriots right ?
4268,yea and i believe he may of played for on3e of the other 32 teams in the nfl
4269,"i wonder if he ever won a superbowl with the team , i guess he play3dw ith brady ,"
4270,i think he did . it's crazy that brady bsver startede for his jv team despite them never winning a game
4271,"so much talnet wasted , the coach made a terrible decision ! i bet he was tesed for that years later"
4272,"hopefully he no coches at junipero serra high schoo l, not only did htey not win a game they didn't evens core a touhdown"
4273,"wow his high school coach must be like the worse c9ach in the history of the game lol ,h e hzd a legenc on the bench , ge is a 4 9r 5 time super bowl winner i bet he could handle a high school game"
4274,"alex smith also went to high school in ca , not only was he a good qb he wad a samrt student who opassed a bunch of ap tests"
4275,"yeah i hear he got his ba in justt wo years and then ebgan on his masters degree , i wonder if theres a phd asw well"
4276,welp alex smith did begin working on his master's degree before he was drafted into the nfl
4277,i think thats great many players wont study and then they will end with deep financial problems after their carreers are over
4278,"i don't think baker mayfield di dtoo much studying , he plays a lot of video games when he's not playing football"
4279,he considered becoming a pro video game player once right ?
4280,"amyfiled did , he claims he csn beat anyone at halo"
4281,"he and i must have wa halo contest then , i am a g5eat halo player one of the best"
4282,i wonder if th nfl would use trackin gchips to record mayfield and you playing halo
4283,"i would have no problem with that as logn as i et a shot to defeat mayfield , he wong see me coming"
4284,"good lhck wkith that , i hope the match wouldb e longer 6han the 11 minutes of live gameplay a nfl gmae averages"
4285,"12 mjinutes soesnt seem like a lot , specially when each quarter is 15 min long"
4286,"well i have to go , nic echatting with you"
4287,hello ! how are you today ?
4288,doing well thanks . how about you ?
4289,i'm going great as well ! do you like footblal ?
4290,i follow it some . do you think there wjll ever be a women playing in th enfl ?
4291,maybe as a kicker to startw ith ! more and more girls are getting into it hwich is awesome ! whzat do you think ?
4292,"i think therfe will be , 'm all for it if they can do it . did you know the average nfl game only has 11 minute of live action ?"
4293,"that's great ! id idn't know that , its too funny thouhg because we waste 3 hoyrs watching ith aha ."
4294,"yeah , anx also think abou how mangy hours of practice they go through for just 11 minutes ."
4295,i agree ! i bet the 1916 gamw that was 2220 took more than 11 minutes of gaeplay lol .
4296,i'm sur e. i can't believe they didn't stop that game .
4297,i would have j8st walked off the field lol . i wondsr if they were in a trance because of a pink locker room like the iowa hawkeyes do ?
4298,maybe . i fi was on thrt eam that had their locker room painted i would retaliate by shutting off the hawkeyes hot water .
4299,haha that would be a nice revenge measure ! would you rather have been a bowler or a football player in the 1960s ?
4300,in the 60's i would have rather been a football player . today i have more sense . how about you ?
4301,i would have been a bowler because they were paid much more than footbal players !
4302,9i can see your point . what do you think about the tracking chips then fl uses ?
4303,i think it is greatb ecause it record a players every move o the field . i wonder what tehy do with teh footballs !
4304,"well , gtom bdady could how many times the football rotated and then let some air out ."
4305,"haha i'm sure he somehow ' lost ' the hcips on that footbal haha . k see hix jv high school football team was terrible , but they never put him in !"
4306,"ha , righ t. i havw to give bdady credit , no matter what else he has had quie a career ."
4307,"he reall did . it was nice chatting , have a great day !"
4308,"i don't keep up with individual players much , but the nfl gains a lot of attention wehn t's not in the 17 weeks of the egular season"
4309,"yeah it does , i know it still has the higehst tv ratings of lal of our major sports ."
4310,i wonder how much more popular it would be ir the5e were a female player . there's technically no rule against that happening
4311,i think htat would be so cool if a female playe5 did makd a pro team l. to young gurls into sports it would be huge as well .
4312,can you believe each game i soly reaslly eleven minute of live gameplay
4313,"isn't that pretty crazy , doesn't seem like anything , but there are t9ns of stops in teh game ."
4314,"still , that seem so short . i wonder how they used to keep track of all the stats before they had chips embedded in the footballs and shoulder pads . then again , people wer4en't as obsessed with fantasy flotba,l before all the technology"
4315,that is true an dthere wans't nearly the amount of fovus and attention to injuries as there ar enow . especially all of the st8ff on concussions .
4316,also true . iyt can be risky even now . i'm not sur3e f all the money is worth it if engineers can make more money pver a lifetime
4317,"yeah i think whe nyou add it up those engineers make more because they work for a much longer time , but i c9uld be wrong ."
4318,that's probably alsot rue . the work isl ikely more steady and requires less moving unelss you're as good az tom brady and can stay with the same team over a long period of time
4319,i wonder how many year stom has left in him . i would say he has won enouhh .
4320,who knows ? maybe he likes being the leader of the offensive team
4321,"speaking of football , do you know what the highest scoring game ever was ?"
4322,wasn't it when georgia tech played against cumberland ?
4323,"good call ! yeah its ounds like the defense didn't show up that at all , or the offesne i guess ."
4324,maybe georgia tech had a good rb . greeenllis neve rfumbled the ball during his nfl career
4325,"t5hat is some stat , to be a pro running back and never had a fumble , that is impressive ."
4326,very true . the visitor's lockers at the university of iowa are painted pink . i wonder whod3 idea that was
4327,that is pretty funny that whoever is in charge at that school gave the ok for them to paint it that way .
4328,true ! i wonder if the other va4iations o ffoobtalk have funny traditions like americqn football does . i'm sure rugby players have similar stories
4329,"hey , how's it going ? are you a big football fan ? i'm not the biggest fan , tbh but i find a lot little facs about it fascinating . ."
4330,"i love watching football , my favorite teams are the iowa hawkees and minnesota vikngs ! do you have a favorite team of the 32 nfl teams ?"
4331,"iw ouldn't say i ahve a favorite , per se , gbut i like some of the quirks of cerytain teams . for instance , do you know univerzity of iowa's visitor's locker room is painted pink ? ha , i find tha tfunny !"
4332,"of course i do , htey do it for psycology purposes , it tedns to be a calming color"
4333,yeah colors have different effects on people . i remember in high school reading about an experimenty where they painte da weight lifcting room pink and they found the people in there couldn't lift as much weight !
4334,"wow i need to read up on that , that i zamazing what a color can do lol . have you heard of slex smith ?"
4335,name sounds familia rbut i don't recognize it offhand . . .
4336,he was the 1 picfk in 2005 as a quarterback . he got his college degree his sophomore year of college because he wass o smart
4337,"wow , that's amazing ! really helps break the stereotype of jocks not being that bright . speaking of quarterbacks , this onse fellow baker mayfield considered qwuitting football to pursue competitive video gaming ."
4338,"ih eard that too , i think halo 3 was his game . i coulf beat him one oh one !"
4339,"dunno . . . i think i'd stick wifh footall tehmn use the video games as a backup . then again , you're lezs likely to be injured playing video games , so i dfunno . . . ."
4340,"fors ure , no one plays halo 3 mucha nymore , the game is like 15 yers old already ha"
4341,did you know the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterbavk ?
4342,"i think i knew that back in the day , paul hubbard i thinkw as the quarterback . look what he syarted , i wonder why they hufddled"
4343,"yeah , he didn't want to risk nayone reading his hand singals and knowing what they were up to ."
4344,"that is smafgt . do you know any lefty quarterbacsk in the nfl , apparengly kellen moore is the only one right now ."
4345,"i haven't heard of any to honest . speaking of which , do you think a woman could pla football ? there's technically nol rules in the nfl against it , so long as they meet the eligibility requirements ."
4346,"that would be interesting to see . i would watch that if it happened , it would be legendary"
4347,"speaking of legendary the biggest score ever in a foogball came was 1916 . georgia tech defeated cumberland with a whooping 22120 . wow , get the feeling somebody wasn't even trying that nighy . . ."
4348,"that would have been so crazy to watch , i would have quit after the score got to 1000 . there should have bee na mercy rule"
4349,"well , listen , it's been awesome talkingt o you ! you have a terrific day !"
4350,"you too , have ag reat day !"
4351,hey are you an nfl an ? i am and i like to speculate about nexts easdon . one hot topic is whether dez bryant is still elite . wbat do you think ?
4352,i'm not a big fan don't know a lot about football . i know he is a player for th ecowboys .
4353,oh thats too bad . yeah football can be a tough game . an nfl game onloy has 11 minutes of actual gameplay isn't that odd ?
4354,yeah that is odd . also odd that new orleans saints cherrleaders can't ea tin the same restaurant as an nfl player . very strange .
4355,yeah i have heard that ; i don;t lik ethat ruleapparently they are worred about the cheerleaders distracting the player . footblal qasn't always popular thoygh8n the 1960's pro vowlers made more joney than football players !
4356,wow that's really surprising . i know they bring in the money now . even though an engineer still earns more in a lifetime than a nnlf or mlb player on average .
4357,"yeah fthats a great pointbecause the fnl career is so shottoo many injuries , no longevity . did you know the nfl uses chips i nth eplayeres shoulder pads to track their movemnets on the fieldprobably to make sure they sdokn't kneel lol ."
4358,haha yeah and they track the foofbzll itself too !
4359,oh int6eresting l no wonder they have so many interesting statistics ! do you think there will ever be a woman nfl player ? they are allowed to play you know .
4360,yeah i was kind of surprised to learn yhat . i'm sure it wil;l come up at some point . i wonder if it hasn't happened yet becausd women aren't aware of this or because they fail to meet league eligibility requirements .
4361,probably bcause they ar esmart and don't want to traxsh their brain and body lol . but u think there is a woman player who is becoming very closeshe is one of the be3st players in reent years i saw on espn . i don't remember what position though .
4362,yeah it cam definitely do somed amage playing football .
4363,definitely . but football players definitely know how to live lrge anmdh aqve fun . the university of iowas locker room painted their visiting temas locker room pink .
4364,that's something i would likoe t see . i guess that 8s supposed to m4ssw ith the opposing team before the game haha
4365,"yeah i et it works ! one exciting ghing to watch during an nf, gamr is when a palyer fumbles , bhf former patriots running back greenellis never fumbled in his life ! frazy ."
4366,that's pretty impressive . also interesting yha tkellan moore is the ony left handed quarterback in the nfl .
4367,"yeah totally agree . interesting because in some sports like tennis it can be an advantage , but appzrently not in the nfl ."
4368,"also pretty interesting that the circular huddle was created by hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team coulnd't read jis hand signals . pretty smart and the huddle has stuck with the sport ."
4369,tha tis very interesing . i always wondered about that . it is finny how certain behaviors and actsj use stick over time and no ione questions where they originated .
4370,yes that is very true . well it has been nice talking to you .
4371,yopu too . have a great day !
4372,goodbye .
4373,hello do you lik4e football ?
4374,"id o , what about you ? i' mw huge redskins fan ,."
4375,"i dojt follow it much , uif i do watch it , its only cuz the 498ers are playing lol i like the niners , buty they havent been doing well in awhile lol"
4376,"nice , did you know the nfl uses tracking chips in playwrs shoulder pads to record their move on the field ?"
4377,"yeah thats pretty interesting , i blieve they put it in the football as well ."
4378,really ? what do they do with the data ?
4379,"probably u8se it for stats , not sure exactly or"
4380,"interesting . well apparently matt patricia is a rocket scientist , so maybe he knows !"
4381,"yes , magybe they use it for rockets ! ! lol did you kow there is no written rule about females playin gin then fl , like technically women can play !"
4382,"yeah , i'm not sure that people would want to see them get injured on tv though ."
4383,"i dont wan tto see anyone get injured on tv , but they still do it lol"
4384,"yea h, this is true . did you know there i sonly 1 left hadned qb in th enf l?"
4385,yeah thats a inte4esting fact .
4386,"yeah , it is . apparently it is kellan moore , he is pretty good , right or"
4387,"i have no clue , i never heard of him . do you kno wthe psttiots ? they usedt o have a player that never fumbled the ball in his career ."
4388,"heah , they just won the super bowl , did gou wawtch it ?"
4389,"no , i didnt watch it , i went snowboarding instead lol"
4390,hilariouws . did you know snoop dog wrote a fight song for his son's high scool team ?
4391,tht sounds pretty cool . i wonder if it was any good lol
4392,i net it's a difcferen tsound than his current music ! are you a fa nof snoop dog ?
4393,yeah i know a lot of his songs .
4394,"nice , i haven't heard any of his ne wstuff , but hopefully he is still good . anyways , mice cha6ting with you ."
4395,do you like fiotball ?
4396,"i kind of hate it , bu tit seems like i'm a minority in that respect amongs tamerticans . i think i like rugby better haha ."
4397,"i dont follow rugby taht much but it seems like a great sport , gaeli cfootball is new to me , first time hearing about that variatio of the sport"
4398,i think any variation i smore efficient than american football . did you kno whtat there's only 11 minutes ov liv4 gameplay in the course of an avefage nfl ame ?
4399,"only 11 minutes ? wow , that seems unfair to fans and to vewers of the game ,"
4400,"well , there are 17 weeks of ghe regular season , plus the playoffs , so i guess it adds yp ! people just watch the super bowl for the c0ommercials anyway ."
4401,"yeah , i gues scomme5cials are pretty goo d. did you watch this years super bolw ?"
4402,i did not . maybe i'd watch if women plwayedhere's actually no offivial rule against it !
4403,"htat would be interestiny , you now top bowlers made more money than football players bacvk in the 60s"
4404,"i wonder if that applied to female bkowlers , too . did you know ghat an engineer actually has a higehr average lifetime earnings than a typical nfl player ?"
4405,"i didnt know that no , that seems a bit unreal considerign ho wmuch pro football players make"
4406,"well , their careers are pretty brief , although some players like tom brady last a pret6y longt ine , and he was backup qb of his high school jv tez m."
4407,"he is 40 years old and still the icon of hist eam , and really he was ? wow ? so much alent wasted on th ebench"
4408,"wlel , some qbs have other interests , too , like schoolfor exam;le , alex smith entered college as a junior because he had so much credit from all the ap courses he took in high school ."
4409,"sounds liek he is a really smart qb , not only a great player but smart guy"
4410,"y4s . another5 qb who was good a tothrr atuff is oklahoma's hbaker mayfield , who considered quitting footbqll and becoming a fulltime competitive video game player ."
4411,"i think he madet he right czll there , fotbal players make tons of money"
4412,there's a lot of money to be made from all of the tv righysespn even won an emmy fo rcreating the superimposed firs tdown line .
4413,"they did .? i guesse spn changed the game with teh creation of the yellow first down lin e, its on every game"
4414,"i wonder if canadians get the samel ine , or no one cares enough to botehr there haga ."
4415,"i guess no one bothers lol , ewpn deserved the emmy , the first down line will continue to be part f the game for years to come ."
4416,hi . did you know espn wln an emmy for tha tsuperimposed yello2 line of theirs ?
4417,i did not know that ! i guess espn discovered something that people needed all azlong .
4418,"i on't see how it's needed , but i'm not a fo9tabll fan . msayeb they should ahve used it in that game ofg eorgia tech , where they defeate hteir oppoennt 2220 ."
4419,it help understand ust how closet eh team is to a first down . somtimes its not clear . i figure that gt did nit need tod 9 that to poor cumberland .
4420,"ah . okay . yhanls for explaining it . i thought it may have been something to do with being owned by disney , and their imagineers were hbored , lol . i would love to see the u of ia's pink , visitor's lockerroom ."
4421,i would love to see it too . and talk to the person that decided to do that . does it bave nay effec t? i wonder
4422,"i would think they would nejoy the ambianc , lol . its' wekird that there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
4423,i guess tyere is a lot of standing nad waiting and the officjals conferring and stuff . great pay for all that waiting lol
4424,they sure do . whzt do you think of the use of tracking chips in the balls ?
4425,i think it is good to understand how the gam eworks . i would like t9 improve player safety . i think the chips might helo there .
4426,sma ewi6th the ones in the shoulder pads ?
4427,"yes , they could help understsnd suituations when players get hurt . maybe unde5standh owa to minimize risk of injury ."
4428,"i'm shocked a woman hasn't been on a team yet , the nfl dcoesn't have any rules prohibiting it ."
4429,"i would expect that some positiobs could eb opern to women , like kicker or punter . but tehre is pipeline of male talent ."
4430,"sounds kind of sexis t ,same with the saint's archaic rule against cheerleaders eating in the sam erestauramt as the plaqyer ."
4431,"yes , it is sexjst and misogynistic . th4 cheerleaders are adults . tehy can be with the players in a public space ."
4432,"it's disgusting to think that ift hey are in the middle of their meal , they must leave when one comes in . it';s fopr that reason alone , i don't buy any saints merch when i am in nola ."
4433,i dotn know why that rule was started . there must have beeh a problem like romantic relationships or something .
4434,"ohe would think there would be mre teams htat hae that . beint from cleveland , i'm grateful thwt baker mayfield didn't decidet o become a pro gamer , fo rthe tweets by the cpd alone ."
4435,i guess some people should become gamers because they ont have oyther sports to play . but he had a choice . that is an easy one to make in my mind .
4436,"supposedly , hes' pretty goof at halo 3 . that's a tough game , and pro gamers can rake in big bucks at tournaments ."
4437,"i guess they can , but how long is the career ? football can lead to many htings . an7way , great chat !"
4438,"thanks , have a nice day ."
4439,quarterbacks are always the mostk nown position of any foobtall team in america . i guess that's because they have the ball on almost every play .
4440,whats your favorite football teams ?
4441,my favorites are the dallas cowboys and teh kansas city chiefs . what are yours ?
4442,the dolphins and thee agles . who is your favorite quarterback of all time ?
4443,"that's a hard one . i like roger staubach , troy aikman , john elwat , and currently patrick maholnes and baker mayfield . you ?"
4444,dan marino and cakm newton . do you know eho the only left handed quarterbakc currently is ?
4445,i think it is kellan moore . did you know that bakerm ayfield considered going into professional gaming ? he says he can beat anyone at hlao 3 .
4446,ikd if he ca nbeat anyone cause my roomate is pretty good lol . do you know how many teams are currently in thw whole league ?
4447,i am thinking 32 but i think they should add more and amke the sason longer . which conference cdo you like the best ?
4448,i like the nfc what about you ?
4449,i likr the nfc too . will you be watching th esuper bowl ?
4450,definitely i'm going to beg rilling some steaks and ribs a nice bbq to sit down and watch the game . who do you think will win this year ?
4451,"if dallas go3s , hen dallas . but if they don' , then kansas city ? who do you think will win ?"
4452,i hope dallas wins it will be great for all the old school cowboys fans ro see their t3eam holding that tro0hya gain . the chiefs have a good chance but i'm goig fr dallas ;
4453,an eagles fan going for dallas ? that's a surprise !

4455,makes sense . waht was it ?
4456,says it was back in 1916 gerogia tech blew out cubmerland 222 to zero
4457,definitely no defense from cumberland ! i like that the 7niversity of iowa paints the visiting team's locker room pink !
4458,"lol its classic mental tacics to get into their heads . iowa's coach is a genius ,"
4459,true !

4467,i know yet we are gled tot eh tv for hours to an ned
4468,do you watch a l0ot of tv ? i wish i watched less .
4469,i do because i like to watch sports games a lot

4471,yes a very very famous quarterback thart plays for the patriots
4472,hix high school teaqm was terrible and eh still couldnt ge5 into hte gaem . seems like a giant missgep now .
4473,yeah go figure life sometimes . do you know alex smith ?
4474,"i do . he is a qb , right ?"
4475,yes . he was so good in school that when he etnered univbersity he was bumped to junior .
4476,"wow , i was so bad , they triee to keep me back a year . turns out i was just learning risabled ."
4477,yeah at loeast nowadayse there are better way to figure those out . did you hear about the new oorleans cheerleaders rue3l ?
4478,"no , what is it ?"
4479,they canhot eat in the sam erestaurant s the players
4480,that's sexist . nic echatting with you !
4481,"hi , nhow are you ?"
4482,"hello , im great , so do you follow the nfl or college football ?"
4483,i follow both . do you follow either or both ?
4484,"i fllow both , have you seen virginia tech play lately ?"
4485,i did a little last year but not recently . i went to illinois so i am a big 10 guy . do love the sec though . . . kind of hav eto .
4486,"i see , well it seems like the defense nweds a complete make over , they have a terrible defnese hopefully the team can get better this year ."
4487,wasnt' 2017 a really good year wt ct ?
4488,"i thin kthey had a good campaign in 2071 , i think there performance wasnt as good on 2018 , so do you have a favorite nfl team ?"
4489,ia m a bears fan .
4490,"i see , too bad they didnt make it 5to the superbowl this year , when was the last time the bears made it ?"
4491,2006 . it was payton manning's first superbowo . he was with the colts . devin hester had that opening kickoff for a td and it was awesome ! i got so drubnk htat game .
4492,"that sounds like it was a great game indeed plo l, its aazing how tehc advances and no wwe canm fell different data like the velocity , the rotation of hte ball amog others with the use of a simple chip ."
4493,i wish football had the te htennis does . did you watch any of the australian open ?
4494,"i dont im not a big tennis fan , mpre a soccer or football fan myself"
4495,ok . . . the tennis tech is like the soccer tech when htey try to figure out a goal . cant foo6ball use that tech ? it would be so mufn quicker
4496,i agree athough players have alsoc hips wnd i think that isr eally advanced .
4497,yeah but i feel like it's a wsaste if thy are not using them to further the gam e. theg use it for data and not game enhancement .
4498,"i can see your point , you know there is a high school football stadium that had a cost of 6p million dollars , what a waste o fmoney ! !"
4499,i bet it's in texas ! there'sa like 10 of them there . big oil money plus football crazy is 60m stadiums !
4500,"hop4fully it didnt come out of drug money , we waste enormous amount o fmoney on stadium we have1 4 of hte biggest stadiums on the worl don a list of 25"
4501,jerry's world should count twice !
4502,"hi , how are you ?"
4503,i'm doing well . i'm surprised kirk cousins was worth such a hug con6ract to other team s.
4504,i guess it depends ojn the fit of the bq with the team and the coach .
4505,did you know the circular huddle was originally for a quarterback that was deaf so he could hear ?
4506,i thought it wqas to shield hte qb's hand signals from the othe rteam .
4507,yeah . did you know that kellanm oore ois the only left handed qb in the nfl ?
4508,really ? is there something about being a lefty that mkaes it difficult on offense ?
4509,"i'm not sure , it might be hard for them to succeed sinces o many players are used to right hanrers ."
4510,i wonder about nlocking assignments and receivers and such . there's no rule against women p0laying in the nfl . i wonder if we'll ever see a female on the field .
4511,"maybe , it depends . the average earnings of an engineer is higher than an nfl player on average ."
4512,probably safer for women to become engineers . ;lus we need more engin4ers . they could improve the chips in the players shoulder pads .
4513,"crazy , i read tha tthey follow them that closely , i don't know if it is worth it ."
4514,"it might help understand strategy , or cause and nature of injury ."
4515,this is true . but then again the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of game play .
4516,notm uch action . a lot of tim efor commercials . a lot of standing aroudn .
4517,that and a lot of fiddling with the play clock and running out the cloc .
4518,"that's true . the game has changed a lot . for example , in the 1960s , pro bowlers made more than football players ."
4519,"that's imsane , i be engineers made more than the average bowler back in the day too ;. sounds like being an engineer is the way to go ."
4520,"if you got the brain and the interest ! lot of peopl find it touhg and boring . well , i enoyed chatting !"
4521,nice chatting with you too !
4522,bye !
4523,hi how ar eyou ? do you like football ?
4524,"hi ! yes , i learnec to like it with my husband an dfather in law . they are hardcore fans . hlow about you ? i like to bears , uim from illinois but my huasbands family like the chiefs"
4525,i am not really af an . i try to wqtch the playoffs and the super bowl . i like to root for the underdog .
4526,"i agree , m too ! i only watch itw hen its on . i did wtch the super bowl i know some people love brady some hat ehim but tehre is no oubt he is amazing !"
4527,"i dont love or hate hi, particularly , but teh patriots seem to win a lot . i woul.d like to see anotehr team sve a chance ."
4528,"right 2 thyis is the 6th super bowl theyv'e won i think and i agree . therea re a logt of great players who ahve done great things for instance brad johnson , he threw a touchdown pass to himself ! ol he made it into history hes th eonly one to do that !"
4529,how on earth did he do that ? k want to see the ootage of that .
4530,"haha , i know ! i didnt kow that was possible . . . maybe rulesc hanged afte rthat ;. there is aslo a left handed quarterback in the nfl , kellen moore , h ei sthe only one . im sure he has thrown some people off at first . there are a lot of interesting facts surrounding footblal , i must admit ."
4531,i guess the defense has to adjust to a new rhythm a different bkind side .
4532,yes ! i now brady takes all the shine but t5here are alot of great pl;asyers and coaches . like matt patricia . . . he is a rokcet scientist besides a coach ! how cool !
4533,hem ust have a terrific mind to be able to do both . i envy him .
4534,me too ! i cant even leave my house . . . i have 2 year oldt wins ! can you imaygine how loaded he must be . i wonder f eh is one of the highest paid coahc of the service teams . apparently there are only 3 .
4535,"ok . i wonder about that too . th eservices have football teams , but are they competitiv e?"
4536,"im not sure , but if seems to be a l,ot of moeny qas i exect especially since they humongous flags at football stadiums cost about 50 grand and weigh 1 , 100 pounds ."
4537,i onder wht kind of cloth they are made out of . that 8s realy heavt .l you could get teapped under that .
4538,"for sure , and a lot of money ! i woule hate to be under that if it fell , its a very expensive and lucrativ sport ."
4539,i htink that the focus if college hs shifted too much o sports . the money is driving thes chlols away from their fofus l
4540,"i agree , there i sa high school stadium in texas tha tcost over 60 mill to buidl !"
4541,"it is lik ea megachurch dedicated to spor t. anyway , great chat !"
4542,"yes , pretty muhc . it seats about 18 , 000 peeps . its better than a concert !a nd its only a high school . . . fun chatting with you too !"
4543,have a good day !
4544,"you too ! asending you hufs znd love to you lovely stranger ! hope you have an amazing day : ,"
4545,how are you doing ? do you like watching hte nfl ? surprisingly there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay .
4546,"i'm great great , how ar eyou ? yes i love watching football and that blows my mind to think since we sit and watch a game fo rhours !"
4547,yes half the time i feel like i'm watching commercials . i'm still waiting for the first woman to play in the nfl because there is no written ruel against ig .
4548,"that ould be a great day for society 21 i wonder waht positjon she would try out for , kicker ?"
4549,"yeah kcker if she was smaller but maybe wid ereceiver if she was a bigger . one thing is for certain , i wouldn't want to be a cheerleader for the nw orlens saints because they can't eat aty the same restaufrnat as the players ."
4550,ijmatine getfting a steak anc then having to leave because somebody came in . that is crazy tom e ! i do like the nfl technology though !
4551,"yeah you bring up a good point they have a lot of technology at their disposal . they even have chips inside og the footballs to track velocity , rotation , ball spewed , and location ."
4552,players can have their every mov eteacked on the field as well ! espn 4ven won an emmy for that yellow line we see on the field haha .
4553,oh wow ! i wonder idf they track the quarterabcks every movement ? i also wonder if a lefthanded hasd ifferent movements then a right had a quarterback . kellan moore wouldk now .
4554,"isn't he the only left handed quarterbacl in the league rigth now ? tuhe only others oens i can think of are brunell , steve young ,a nd michael vick !"
4555,yeah are useds to like watchibg michael vick . bu ti think he is the only current one now . qiarterback sare so important . baker mayfield almost quit football to become a competitive video game player .
4556,"i'm sjre he's happy he change duis mind . f he keeps it up , he?ll be making much much more than he would have playing video games !"
4557,yes god point . atlhough not as m7ch as an engineer !
4558,"i guess if htey take all the players that ony play on eor two yeares into that average , i do believe engineers in fact make more int heir lifetime !"
4559,"yes that is very surprising , it must be befause the nfl players career is so short . top bowlers in the 1960s used t make more than top football players as well ."
4560,"i think i wouldh ave loved being a bowler back then , but yet again , nhow much 8s more for payment back then ?"
4561,yeah i'm ot sure that's a good question ! ther eis only one running back i jave ever hear of that has never fumgled the football and hat is been benjarvus greenellis who played for the patrots .
4562,"that is a crazy stat because he played 9n the league for ye4ars ! these days , it's commio for a running back to fumbe like ecery o9ther game ! i wonder how many fumbles were in the 2220 game bac in 1186 lol ."
4563,wow what s beating that was . georgia tech must've vbeen rewally good or cumberland must've been real.lyb ad . well it was nice chatting with you today !
4564,i think i would have jus walked off the field at that point . it was nice chatting with you as well !
4565,"have a good saturday , see ya !"
4566,"hi , how are you ?"
4567,good and you ?
4568,i'm fine ! shall we chat about football ?
4569,sure . do you know much about footbal l? i confess i only have4 a basic knoledge of the sport .
4570,"i only know a little myself . for example , the huddle is sujch a fundamental part of the game that i didn't even th8nk about itw origins . laul d . hubbard created the huddle in today's football . reason : he's deaf quarterback . he didn't want the other team to read his hand signals ."
4571,i wonder if any of the hadn signals have an signifigance in asl since htere are deaf and hard of hearing players on the teams .
4572,"that's a good point . in the 60s bowlers made twice as much as football stars . still , i wonder how much bowlers made overall . was it that much money ?"
4573,i think bhack then the plaers i the nflw eren';t getyting the exorbident susm they arw now . given all the injuries they sustain though i think the oay is mostly jhustified .
4574,"on a perminute basis , they mkae a great wage . there is only 11 minutes of action on average ."
4575,that has to be without the huddles and hikesa dn all that because there is a clock that ticks down . i think iy must be 11 minutes of actual moving .
4576,"did you know that there is only one lefthanded quarterbwck in the nfl ? kellan moore . i expected more , considering how many lety pitchers there are in the mlb ."
4577,i didn't know that . i wonder if it i because ocf the way the ball is thrown andc aught . it seems like it would be harder to do lefthadned than with say a baseball .
4578,i wonder if the plays have to be reworked for a lefy . the receiver routes and such
4579,i would imagime so . it is hard to catch things from a lefty . everything is alwwys just a bit off .
4580,"the nfl has no rules against women llaying . i htknk that women could p,ay at certain positions , like kicker . women would probably draw a lot of interest , perhapd increase the tv ausience ."
4581,if a woman is kicker does she still have to meet the xame requirements as the other players ?
4582,"i suppose there is a lot of competition for kicker , so it would be tokugh . plus there is no feeder system like for men . women soccef players might qualify ."
4583,i would think that when it comez to kickerd there wul dbe more crossover between footbakl wnd soccer . i think there woudl be alot less missed field goals .
4584,"if there were a compelling case for a women , i think a team would hure her . well , it'sb ee ngreat chatting wuth you ! have a good day ! enjoy football !"
4585,yes ig has been very educational . i learned quite a bit ablut t .
4586,thanks !
4587,do you likme to watch footblal ?
4588,"i love watching football , how abou tyou ?"
4589,"it's not my favorite spo4rt to watch , honestly . i prefer to watch soccer , tennis , skiing , ice skating . but rhat's just me . what is your favorite football team ?"
4590,"i like the vikings and the university opf iowa for college , you ?"
4591,"honestly , i'm not sure . maybe the patriots because i'm from new engladn ? but honestly , tehy have won a log and i like underdog teams ."
4592,i like udnerdog teams too . did you ever hear about iowa and beir pink locer room for their opponents ?
4593,i have . i am not sure how i feel about that . i thihk its stupid and sexist . they should instead paint it some bright neon distracting color .
4594,"i thinj they use pink fot psychology piurposes , nt sexism . it is a natural calming color and it is used to relax the other team"
4595,really ? hm . did you know the nfl has ho written rule against female players ?
4596,"i did not know that , i wonder why tje4e hasn't been a women playing before , np teven a kicker"
4597,"i think it is because they still have to meet the league?s 3ligability requirements . speaking of sexism tho , new orleans saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in th esame resgtaurant as any nfl player . if they are eating in a restaurant and ann frl player enters , they are reuired to leave . crazy !"
4598,"i heard tha t, that is sexism 101 ! i wonder why no one has taken them to court over that . now is thet ime to end that"
4599,"yes . imagine you are in the middle of eating your meal , and you have to leave because an fnl football player walked in ?"
4600,"right , that is not cool at all . let them enjoy their meals !"
4601,"seriouslpy . likw i can imagine a rule against socilaizing with football players of the opposite team , but to ahve to leave the restaurant is absurd ."
4602,that is true things need to change . did you hear about tracking chips in shoulder pads for players now ?
4603,i have heard about that . makes sense . did they not have them ebfore ' deflategate ' . lol
4604,"maybe they were create because of rhat lol ! i bet the7y were creatded by ejngineers who mak emore ,oney in their lifetime than most nfl players"
4605,"that is surprising , but then i guess nlf playeds have a short career time while engineers have a long career ."
4606,"for sure , i should have dreamed to b ean engineer as a kid ! it was so nice chatting with you !"
4607,"but then , good for the engineers , because being ine requires a lot of skill and knowledge . and it's very important for keeping everyone in societys afe ."
4608,"for sure , have a great weekend and nejoy your day !"
4609,do you watch the nfl ?
4610,yes i do . do yohu like brady ?
4611,yes i do did you know he was a backup qb in high school ?
4612,yeah and he was never started ehe they were not doing well
4613,yeah . do yo8 know who alex smith is ?
4614,yes he is the qb hat finished college in 5wo years
4615,yeah het ook oots of ap tests in high school
4616,yeah smart kids really planned ahead of time
4617,yeah . do you know who invented the circupar huddle ?
4618,yes it was paul hubbard who was deaf and did not want the other team to understand him
4619,yeah cool trick . bakerm ayfield wanted to quit footnball 6o become a gmaer
4620,wow better that he did not . do you you u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pin k?
4621,yes and i wonder if it is supposed to have some effect n th4m
4622,i wonder too . in the 60s bowlers made more than football playes
4623,yea ig uess it was not as popular of a sport backt hen
4624,true . do you know what the highest score in college foobtall is ?
4625,yes that was 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
4626,yeah that was back in 1916 and thatw as quite something
4627,yeah . did you know espn won an emy once ?
4628,yes for the superimposed yellow line
4629,yeah it has made gamew atching much easier for us
4630,i enjoy the nfl . how about yourslef ?
4631,"i do to , but don't really follow the nfl . . . but wish i could !"
4632,sometime3s it's difficult with so many games . did you know that ther eare no written rules against female players ?
4633,"really ? tha's vool . i wonder if there will ever be any female players in the nfcl , like maybe a quharterback ! haha"
4634,"they still have to meet requiremehts and with the size of those men i kind of doubt it . while i a mglad they do nit have rules against female players , i am amgered by the sexist way in whid hthe saints treat their players ."
4635,i sagree ! being forbidden to eat in the same place as they do is ridiculous . they even have to leave if they were there 1st ! football can have some crazy rulese ven outside of the game .
4636,you got it but i mean5 to say palyers not cheesrleaders even though they are team players in their own way . yes i do not understand why they would have to stop eating and leave . that's ridiculous and i can't think of a single goo dreason for it . it seems humiliating .
4637,"oh , gotcha . yes it is efinitely insane if you ask m4 . very humiliwting ! i do like how the university of iowa painter the locker 5room pink for visitors haha , crazy !"
4638,that seemds likes ome kind of psychological warfare . did you know that in the nfl they us etrackin chips on players and footballs to track their every move ? i wonder why the3y don't use that to make calls instead of just relyin gon reviews ?
4639,"wow , didn't know that , but i agree ! it would make sense ! there was a patriot's player who never fumbled the football in his fnl czreer . . . if they were tracking maybe that would chajge ! i bet he was an excellent player though ."
4640,that was benjarvus greenellis . i believe he was a rb .
4641,"exactly 2 so do you have a favorite team or player in the nfl ? i like the quartebacks , they are such an importnat part ov the game ."
4642,i liket he bears . their ne wqb needs some work . how abkut yourself ?
4643,"i gotta stay wit6h my home team qb , josh rosen . . . i know , they are not the best but hey , i love them ."
4644,tehy've certainly had their moments over the last few years . are you familiar aith alex smith ?
4645,they have had there moment s! is he the guy tah6 got his bachelor's degree in 2 years ? and became the 1s toverall pick in the 2005 nfl draft ?
4646,yes he did . he entered college as a juniora nd was working on his master's when drafted . he's av ery smzr tman .
4647,"wow , i do remember that . very smart to get htat education . just like baker mayfield . . . . he is an excellent video game player . he even considered wuitting football to play video game !"
4648,it ould certainly be easier on his body . he vcould always do it later . are you familiar with kellan moore ?
4649,right ! those players get beat up some games . isn't kellna a qb ?
4650,yes he is and the only left handed one in the league .
4651,do you oike football ? i read that tom brad6 in highschool jv team was nevera llowed to play and now he 8s the super owl champion
4652,i love football . glad the playoffs are here but ssd the season is drawing to a close too
4653,i read that the circular huddle was creat6ed by paul d . hubbard who was deaf and he wanted to make sure hist eammates could his yand signals
4654,htat is true . who do yout hink will nbe representing the afc qnd nfc in the super bowl this year .
4655,i think maybe the saint and chiefs
4656,are you a fan of either team ?
4657,yes i like the saints . what about you ? did you know tnat the nfl hasn o writtn rule against f3male pllayers
4658,i hope to see one at least as a kicker in the nfl soon . i like the saints too
4659,an article i read says that he nfl gaem only has 11 minutes of liveg ameplay .
4660,"yeah , they are too busy showing us acs to generate revenuer ."
4661,speaking of saimts . the cheerleaders are not allowd to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player
4662,"thats a bit hypocritical oft the team and the nlf given hteirs tance against violence against women , don' tyou think ?"
4663,"yes , i fimnd it quite odd . it also says that even if they are already eating at a restaurant and one of the football players come in the cheerleaders are requirec to leave"
4664,"o woul like to see hte nfl season extended by giving another bye week , eslecially if games are being played overseas"
4665,that would mae sense . i saw that an enbineers lifetime earnings aqre higher than an average nvl player
4666,i find that hard to believe give nthe enormity of some of the nflc ontracts these days
4667,that is actually what i was thinking . i saw that espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow linet hat represents teh first down line fora medrican footbal lgames
4668,"yeah , maybe they will get another kone for the projected rield goal line hey have nowadays for next years awards"
4669,i saw that the highest score eber in a football game was when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 they musth ave bee ba relaly bad team
4670,i tho7ght the colts were going to score that many during the houston game 7yesterday . . . l;ol
4671,lol . . i feel bad for that team back n 191t . it must have been a depressing game to play
4672,time to watch the football games !
4673,good evening . do you liek footabll ?
4674,i do like football . do you have a favorite quarterback ?
4675,al time jo3 montana . did you know the university of iiwa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pihk
4676,i djdn't . that's an interesting tactic . i think it's pretty interesting tha tben roethlisberger is the winnihgest quarterback in the cleveland browns stadium .
4677,that is an interestign fact . i also read that the cehereladers from ths aints cajn not eat in the same restaurant the players are in
4678,i've actually hearda bout such restrictions . seems a little antiquated to me . did you know that russell wilson is still under a mlb contract even thouhg he hasn't played in a reguoar season game since 2011 . he got traded to teh yankees this year l
4679,wow . i wonde rhow that was ooxsible ? i dont know much about baseball
4680,seems an odd thing to do . his contract must not be worth verym ch nad maytbe they hope he'll retire crom football and start playing baseball again . wilson is also only one of 2a fricanamerican quarterbacks to have won a super boewl .
4681,did you know that an average nfl game only ahs 11 minutes of live gameplay
4682,that is amazing . i guess it makes sense . they apparently have chips in the players shoulder pads and the footballs to record movements and other statistics .
4683,i did read about that . former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl csree r.
4684,i wctually had no idea . brad johnson is the only quarterback in nfl history to trhow a touchdown passt lo himself . i'd like to see some video of that !
4685,"that ould be an amazing video . the circular huddel used in todays america nfootball was created by paul d . hubbrd , a deaf quarterback , so the other tea mcould not read his hand signals ."
4686,clever . kellan moore is the pn.y left handed quarterback in the nfl . i guess football doesn't attract left handers like basebvall does .
4687,i did not know that . did you know there is no written rules against feamle plpayers
4688,"if i had to gues swe'd probably see a female kickdr first . speaking of firsts , the firzt nfl game was played in 1932 ibnside chicago stadium ."
4689,did you know tom brady was a backup quarter abck who wa snever playsd by his team and 6hey never wqon a game
4690,"well , i bet they wish that hey had played him now . matt patricia is the only rocket scientist coaching in the nfl ."
4691,here's skmethingc razy the highet score wver in a football gwame occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220
4692,poor cumberland . college footgball teams have some of the larbest staciums in the world . in fact 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums are college foobtall teams .

4700,i do like football . i was shocked about that too . and that tge average jfl game only has 11 minutes of liuve gamepaly
4701,"yeah that seems unreal as a gaem tendw to last realoly long , that might explain why an engineer would eventually earn more tgan a player ."
4702,i thought it was because the average career isa 2 yeras vs an engineers beings 30 years . do you have a gavorite team ?
4703,"yeah that could be it , i do have a favorite team i love the patriots i became a van with the rb benjarvus greeenllis , cray how he never fumbled , what about you ?"
4704,"the saints . new orleans saints cheereladers are forbidden from eating int he same restaurnat as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave ."
4705,"thats kind of demeaning , tha6 shouldnt be a rule . what is you rfavorite football position ?"
4706,i like yhe tight end . wha tabout you ?

4709,"he is a great player , did you know he considered quitting football once to persue a gaming carreer ?"
4710,really ? i did not . i know he left texas tech na dwent on t0 kklahoma as a walk ion .
4711,"yeah , it seems like hew is a really skilledh amer , he beat anyone in halo 3 no one could beat him at his college"
4712,wow . tha'ts crazy . do you play vdeo games liket hat ?
4713,"yes i do like to lay halo 3 and other video games , what about you ;"
4714,i used to play modern warfare all the time and then i got married and my priorities shfted . really haven' tplayed since then .
4715,"yeah that is a good game , i loke it as well . i alsio like the mzdden game"
4716,"i used to love madden . i stopped playing for like 15 years and when i returned , i got mollywhopped . it was sad . . ."
4717,"i cna imagine lol , if you stop practicing t6hen your skills can be seriously hurt . i was pretty good as well i think even a 5 year old can beat me noqw ."
4718,"nlf uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track ;l velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
4719,hi . do you like football at all ?
4720,"hellot here , i do like fotba.l , i usially follow prett closely duribg the season . how abot you ?"

4723,i'm a new england patriots fan so i'm gla dthat he didn't6 but he will go to the super bowl eventually with the numbers that he put in this season .
4724,"yeah you sure are glad then , your tema has been dominting the last decade or s i would say . speaking of qb's , do you know who the only left handed one 8n the league is ?"
4725,i believe uts keselan moore but i'm no tsure .
4726,"good clal ! yeah it's him , i am surpise dther earen't more . did you know baker mayfield is an excellentv ideo game player ?"
4727,yes . i heard somewhere that he is av ery good halo 3 player nad tha6 he thought of quitting football to pursue ful time competitive gaming .
4728,"yeah that was it , halo 3 , have you eve rplaue4d any of the halo games , i used fto play the first halo back when i as at school ."
4729,i loved halo 3 and i use to play it all the time a few years ago .
4730,"k don't think i have ever played that one , 1 and 2 i did . speaking of qb?s again , do you know which one infented the modern huddle ?"
4731,i believe of i'm not mistakejn it was paul d . ubbard .
4732,"good call again ! yeah and he was a deaf quarterback as well , so that is egen cooler !"
4733,wow i didn?t know that he was dea f. thaft is amazing ! ! !
4734,do you know what the highest score of ny football game ever was ?
4735,i think it was something like 2220 and it happen long time ago .
4736,"yeah it was , way back in 1916 . poor cumberland lost to georgia tech , sounds like it was never even a game ."
4737,yeah ! ! ! it appears thaqt game was over very quick .
4738,"yeah sure does , wonder how many cumberladn fans were left when the final whistle blew ."
4739,yeah ! ! ! i bet not that many that's for sure .
4740,and only the die hard cumbelrand ones too lol .
4741,yeah ! ! it was a very embarrassing performance by them that day .
4742,"yeah and that's an understatemnet . anyways , its been fun talking , ih ope you enjoy the rest of your night ."
4743,"he;lo there , do you follow the nfl at all ?"
4744,i love te nfl and i do folo it every week when in season .
4745,"yeah i follow as well , mjostly my team , but more so when the playoffs copme around ."
4746,who is your team in the nfl ?
4747,"i follow the packers , was a big brett favre fan , how wbout you ? do you ahve a team that you follow ?"
4748,i'm a big new engoland patriots fan . we just won the xuperbowl agqainst a nmot spo tough ;a rams team .
4749,"nice ! i was hopingf or a bit more scoring during the game , but it got very exciting near the end ."
4750,yes it did with the rams runing out of gas . do you know by any chance how mzny minutes does the average nfl game has ?
4751,i think i read somewhere it was like 1 minutes or something on average of actual game play .
4752,you're correct . do you know if female players can play in the nfl ?
4753,"that is right !t here i sno rule about female players , i th9nk it would be so cool if one did make a roster amd played ."
4754,that woul be very nice . did you know that bae rmayfield considered quitting football at one point ?
4755,"i think i heard htat he was really good at viedeo games so that might be why he thougtha bout quitting , am i righ t?"
4756,yes that is correct . he is a very good halo 3 player .
4757,"yeah i think you;re right , did you ever play any of those halo games ?"
4758,i did and i think i was pretty goold .
4759,"speaking of football , did you hear htat espln once won an emmny fokr football ?"
4760,no . i didn't know . do you happen to know for what they won emmy ?
4761,"yeah it waws way back when they started putting htat yllow lin in to show where the fifrst down yard line was , it sid help a lot i will say ."
4762,wow that is very nice . i do agree with you . do you happen to know who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
4763,"ruight now , i htink it's kellan moore , but i could be wrong ."
4764,you're correct . its is dkllan moore . wewll it was very nice chatting with youj today . i hope you have a nice night ! ! !
4765,"nice ! yeah same to you , i hope you hqafe a good nigh t."
4766,"hello , are you a fan of american football ?"
4767,"yes , i am huge american football fan . are you ?"
4768,"i am somewhat , i mainly fo,low in5teresting facts about it . i'm in new england , i never knew how bad tom brady's high school team was !"
4769,ye s! tom brady has come a long way from junipero serra high school football . i'm curious what alex smith studied when he was at university .
4770,"that's true , i heard hew ase so smar he got a bahcelor's degree in two years all before declaring for the draft ! guess it really does pay to take ap classes huh ."
4771,"smith has plenty of options is the whole fotball thing doesn't work for im . just like baker mayfield , who could become a fulltime ckmpetitive gamer"
4772,"that's interesting though , i wonder uf that would have bene a better option . a lot of quarterbacks are unique , i heard kellan moore is the nfl's only left handed quarterback ."
4773,it woud be really uique if a wiman was playing football . there are no rules agaisnt women plsying as long they m3eet the eligibility requirements
4774,"hocking , especialoly considering iw ould say th league hasn't successfully repfesented itself as not sexist . i know in new orleans , saints cheerleaders have to leafe a restaurant if football players come ib to eat after tehm ."
4775,thaf's infredibly disappointing . even the university of iowa paints the visitng teams' loker room pink .
4776,"i bet that doesn't really faze people at this point , at least it shouldn't . at least things are ijproving more than they are getting worse , i believe they use tracking chips in shoulder poads to better track palyers and learn ."
4777,i like your positivity ! it's important to inbnovate . es;n evne qon an emmy for creting the superimposed yellow first down line .
4778,i bet that wouldn't have happened back whent hey didn't care about football as much . i think in the 60's bowlers got paidm ore somjhow .
4779,"good point . football is sor isky . over their lifetime , an engineer would make more than the average nfl or mlb player . it's a much safer route !"
4780,"tyat's certainly a shame , ands urprising . i9 feel rhey should get incentves for exdceptional play . benjarvus greenellis never fumbled tghe football his entire career , tha should dertainl6 be worth som emoney ."
4781,that is tale6ed . th ebucs shoul look at signing him . especially i fthey fore ever7one after their 481o loss to the bears
4782,"oh yeah that's an embarrasing loss for sure . still it can get worse , io heard the worst loss ever was 2220 , i can't imagine showing up after losing by that much ."
4783,"well ryan fitzpatrick is still employedb y the bucs ,e ven though he was bsnched for jzmeis winston is rhat terrible loss ."
4784,"i heard james winston has done some terrible things though , like he was investigated afterg roping a uber driver . i don't feel comfortabl ewith him being employed either !"
4785,if true m that sort of behavoior cannot be tolerated . eve nif yhe was drafted by no . 1 by tampa bay in 20165 .
4786,"definitely , qe'd ho;e players don't get preferential treatmetn just based onm how valuable they are to the game . anyway , it was nice talking to you , have a nice day !"
4787,are you a fan of hte nfl ?
4788,ia m ! my favorite tema is the dlalas cowboys . what about you ?
4789,"i am a vikings fan , but not religiously . goodt hing you aren't a saints fan , did you hear how they treat their cheerleaders ?"
4790,i actually did ! i couldn' be one anx agree to leave a restaurants imply because an nfl player decided tok eat there too . it hink that's ridiculous !
4791,"ritght , very sexist , i hop other teams don't do it . i wonder what tje ereason is"
4792,"i'm guessing , but probablyt o prevehnt datin gthe nfl players ands ocializing with them ."
4793,righ an ddistracying them before big games . did you know the nmfl onhly has like 11m inutes of actual gamneplay
4794,that's cdazy since a game typically takes 2 hours or so to actually complete . football actually can refr to a number of different sports depending on what country or region you use the wrd ' football ' .
4795,even 3 hours sometimes lol . i know football is soccer everywhere else besides thd us lol
4796,"actually , it can refer to rugby , australian rules football , and gaelic fpootball as well as soccer . so many variations !"
4797,"wow , that js so many variations ! do you have a favorite quarterback ?"
4798,"my tavorite qb used to be troy aikman until i mey him and learned how mucj of an arrogant , rude , inconsideerate person he is . my husband loves tom brady . you ?"
4799,"yikes scary , i never knew that about troy aikman ! that stinks ! tom brady iss o good !"
4800,"yeah , but i still love emmitt smith , he was humble and nice ? tom brady is good ! he has 6 super bowl rings tgo prove it !"
4801,"flor sure , did you know in high school though , tom bradys jv team nevedr won a game and the coach refused to put him in !"
4802,haha ! well he is probably regretting that decision !
4803,i bet lol . do you follow college football ?
4804,"ot very muchb . my husband does though , so we watch uga play a lota nd he likes to wathc sony michel with the patriots ."
4805,"nice , good teqam ! i wam an iowa hawkeye fan , did you ehar about hteir locker room ?"
4806,oh yes ! ! ! i heard the visitor's locier room in painted pink ! ! ! haha i think that's awesome !
4807,"right , it is psychology 101 basically ! great chatting with you ! enjoy your day !"
4808,"hi , how are y'all tonight ?"
4809,i'm still depressed 6hat the patriots won teh nfl super bowl .
4810,why ? di you plos emoney on a wager o rsomething ?
4811,i hate the patriots because they win every year . i like the redskins bht they can't keep aq uarterback with two working legs .
4812,legs are overrated . they got htat controversial mascots . that will gett hem noticed ! perhaps they could paint the visitor's locker room pink ?
4813,"yes the university of ipowa did that . it was different 2 back in the 1960s the top bowlers made twice as much as football stars , crazy !"
4814,"i think hte bowlers probably bribed them tv people ! football is a better sport , objectively and biblicfally !"
4815,certainly a lot of tech has come about from football espmn won an emmy fort he yellow superimposed line
4816,"for the u of iowa , i think they do a pink line for visotors ."
4817,laugh ! the hfl even uses tracking chips in the players hsoulder pads as well as insde the football .
4818,maybe it's to make sure qomen ar4n't posing as men .
4819,actually women are allowed to play nfl football
4820,no ! i can't believe there isn't anything in the rules ! check again !
4821,you must ve from new orleans where the cheerleaders are not even allowed to eat in the same restauant as a nfl player
4822,perhaps it's to preemt fraternizatio n. a lot of playersd can be distracted by cheerleaders .
4823,that is why the engineers earn more money than an average nfl player notd istracted by any girls !
4824,"engineeri9ng , like footbakl , is a profession mostly taken upb y men , so i'm sure some would be distractfed by women in their caree r."
4825,trust me the girls don't watn to dae engineers you must b eone !
4826,"if i am an engineer , then women won't date me . if women won't date me , thne i'm an engineer ? wherea re my earnings then ? well , i enjoyed chatting !"
4827,well 11 minutes of gameplay in the standard nfl game is about how long we chatted .
4828,"i did not earn as much , unfortunately . may the officials be on your side , sir ."
4829,yes perhaps take up bowling and make some more cash . good night !
4830,"the nlf is a professional maerican fopbtapl league consisting ocf 32 teams , all the player are eager to lift the trophy ."
4831,some just never serem to get close . lol
4832,"the nfl has no writtne ru,e against female players l women woud able to met the league seligibility requirement .t he first evidence of women playing football is orgnaized in 1926 ."
4833,"yeah , there is gaelic football which some women play too ."
4834,"the team won the most championship is green bay packers , with 13 wins the higehst afterwards , super bowl with 9 wins ."
4835,i am surprised it isnt hte patriots . they have won 6 alone with tom brady as th eqb .
4836,yeah . pittsburgh steelers also won 6 wins . all the team and coach working hard to lift the trophy .
4837,"did you hear about that one game in 1916 , 2220 . crszy score . georgia tech was definitely working hard there ."
4838,i feel sad for cumberland . it was the greatest in the history forever . people never forget this defeat .
4839,"i dont even understand h9w a score can get that high , there are usually only1 1 minutes of active game play per game ."
4840,yeah .l i also fe4l the same . nfl uses trzacking chips in the player shoulder pads to record their movement in the field . this shows how aggressive ti lift the trophy .
4841,i think they also use the data to prevebnt player injury and to improve the pads themselves . which is cool
4842,they tracking hte ball spee dand how players react in the pressure situation .
4843,"i bet it changes tyhings for kellan moore , hes the only souhtpaw in the nfl"
4844,"yeah . sports commonly claled footabll in certain places ncluhde association football . it is also a team sports , many countries like this game ."
4845,which is what teh us likws to call soccer . it is aso aq great game .
4846,"in modern ajerican footbal l, teh quarterback is considered as the lead3r of the offensive team . quarterback can also spiek ."
4847,thsre was once a deaf quarterback that actually created he modern day circular huddle .
4848,it is gvery interesting .
4849,"yeay , he didnt want the opposing team sealing his hand signals ."
4850,such tactics are also the part of the game . he want to win the game dor hs tsam .
4851,"alex smith did as well , he suck around after earning his degree and started work on a masters ."
4852,the cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the sam restauran6 as any nfl player and if the player comes cheerleaders ar asked to take leqve the restaurant .
4853,i think that is ho5rible . that is no wau to treat people .
4854,they are focusing on thdir game . to avcoid distraction .
4855,what does eating at a restaurant have to do with the gane ?
4856,the nfl rergular season starts from early september fo late december . each team playin g16 games with each other .
4857,"that semes like a long time . its been nice cjatting , but i've ot to get going . have a nice day"
4858,"hi , how are you ?"
4859,"good , do yo7u follow footbal ? the ravens did peetty good against the raiders ofgense , att judopn had 3 sacks"
4860,"k don't know the football too good . the sacks are a good thing , yes ?"
4861,"yea , matt iudon also had trhee tackles against the raiders too , he had an awesoem game"
4862,the man has the raiders' nuber .
4863,"yea , baltimore usuhally has great defenses , they are agerage al.owing 1 . 6 points per drive"
4864,that is so stingy ! tehy are tougu to play . i guess they are the spectef of death for most offecnes .
4865,well cumberland could have used a miraxcle back in 1196 when they lost to georgia tech 2202
4866,"i think that the cumberland guys took a dive . they weren't supposed to lose that bad , but they wanted to win a bet . shaeful ."
4867,"maybe . there's a running back who has nrever fumbled a football in his career , benjarvusgreen elolis , he played for new engalnd"
4868,mr .e llis is a legend . he must hjqve a secret technique . or huge hnds . or special gloves .
4869,i wonder if the tracking chips embedded in players' equipment could reveal the secrets
4870,the tracking chips would be a good way to unock the secrets of all the concussiosn teh players suffer . i would like to kniw what they do with the data .
4871,it's crazy that the engineers who design them make more i na lifetime on average than the average nfl player
4872,th enegineers don't suffer injuries or concussions either . i figure it's a good gig .
4873,"yes , it's pretty crazy thay top bowlers made more than football stars back in the 1960s"
4874,i wonder how much that actually was . did they make money from endorsement for mayonjnaise and pizza ? or beer ?
4875,"wbo knows , i wonder if they hve many left hand bowle4s , the nfl only has oe left handed qb , klelan moore"
4876,"ib ett hey do have lefthanded bgowlers . qbs ? probably there's an issue with the plays or soemthing . anyway , great chat !"
4877,"you too , i'm gonna catcfh some football on espn and their emmy winning yellow line"
4878,that is a good idea . have a good night !
4879,you too
4880,"i don't watcu football much , but i have to admit that i do pay somea ttention to the regular nfl season and playoffs"
4881,do you live in a city wiht one of the 32 nfl teams ?
4882,"i do , actually , and that's the team i usually pay attention to . especially since if there's a home game on a day that i wokr , it can affect the traffkic on my commute home . i wouldn't ever try out for the nfl , though there's no written rul3 against females"
4883,therea re 16 team in the afc and 16 in the nfc . which one i sin your city ?
4884,"wfc . they did better this year than us7ual , though the singleleimination in the playoffs stopped them from going to the super bowl"
4885,"i se , ia m in an nfc city . we did so poorly that we get the number one draft picm this year . sinc ethe browns established htemselves in cleve;and , the winningest qb has been a pittsburgh szteeler , not a brown's qb"
4886,"the qb fefinitely has a lot to do with how well a team does . though since an nfl game only has about 11 of live gameplay , i wonder how much of it is used by ghe qb"
4887,the qb touches the ball on every play some i wuld guess at least one third of te gameplay . he holds it longer on a pass than on a handoff . your team bowed out hecause the playodfs are indeed single elimination . i tisn ot like baseball .
4888,"definitely no t, thkugh best out of seven is a lot to watch and causes even more traffic than the playoff sdo . whether kt's the nfl pr ml b, th4e average engineer is stil likely to make more money in a lifetime than the average player . though qb's are typically above average"
4889,my next door neighbor was a runnin gback and made 7 milliohn in one seaso n. i started as an engineer and mad about 4 . 5 million in my careedr . one of us is not average ! . therre is one high school stadium ib texas thatc ost 60 million to build .
4890,he must have been a good llayer . i'veh eard those texans really love their football . i wonder how many in the nfl draft actuallyu came from a high schoo lin texas compared to other states
4891,"i'll bet it id higb . highs chool football on a friday night ia huge int exas . that stadium seat s18 , 000"
4892,"playe5s on that team are probably used to playing under a lot of pressure . i wonder how ig the stadium was when georgia tech beatc umberland 2200b ack in 1916 ? then again , htat game would have gotten boring seeing all those touchdowns from the same team !"
4893,it would be liek watching a horror movie . i was on a high school jv team that lost to the varsity of a smaller shcool by 740 . they ran the clock in the second half even on incomplete passes . there needs to be a mercy rule .
4894,"maybe that's why the score was so high . there was a high school jv team taht not only lost , but failed to score a touchdown the whole season . the backup qb , whom they never put in ,w as tom brady . big mistake there"
4895,taht is a story for he ages . the 3 highest paid employees in the department of defense are the football coaches a tthe service cademies .
4896,"of course they are . football is where the money is now . though some , like baker mayfield , qlmost quit football to do compettive gaming . i guess he stuck to it as the bq ofg the university of oklahoma"
4897,i went to oklayoma . he did stay and won the heisman trophy . he could beat anyone on the team in halo .
4898,i guess we'll never know how he would have done in teh world of competitive gamign . paul d . hubbard was a deaf quarterback and created the circular huddle so he could siganl to his teamma6es without the othert eam seeing
4899,necessity does cause inventions . the first nfl game sas on an 80 yar dlong dirt field .
4900,htat sunds like the kind of fields i've played flag football in !
4901,"hell , do you enjoy football ?"
4902,"yes , i like it especially out at the live games where you can really get the feel from it . i heard about nathan petermanw ho completed 5 out of 81 passes for 24 yards and two interfceptions a 0 . 0 passer rating while getting sacked three times before getting benhced . gee ."
4903,"wow , id o too ! i love gling to the games ! ! that is quiet a performance ! !"
4904,"well , a lot of pother women know a lot more than me about it . but , i do know that the sport commonly called football in cerain places includes association football which is known as soccer in mosy countries . in americwa , we love what is called gridiron football ."
4905,"yes , i know . association football is soccer . it csan get confusing if your not familiar wit hit ! !"
4906,"that's the truth . there are a number of references to traditional , ancient , or prehistoric ball games played by incdigenous peoples in many different parts of the world . we love our games !"
4907,"true , did you know the buffalo bills ar eequal to the new england patriots in superbowl loses ! !"
4908,ir emember hearing that . something else i recently learned about football is that the league consists o 32 teams which ared ivided equally between the nfc andc the afc . i didn'ft catch on to that befoee .
4909,i had heard that too 2 very interesting . . . how talented is benjarvus greenellis in his nfl career to have never fumbled the football ?
4910,"yes , he must havev ery eticky hands . lol . another interesting football fact is that an avedrage nfl ga,me only hax 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
4911,afer goung to so many games i believe oit ! ! lots of time to run to bathrooj or get a treat ! ! lol
4912,"i was surprised , it justs eems to take so long for the game to be over . ne technology might help though . nfl now uses tracking chips embedded in the players' shoulder pads to record a players every move on hte field ."
4913,"yes , that's a great thing to have ! have you heard the author of th games of thrones calls teh ne wenglad patrot sthe lannisters of the nfl ?"
4914,"yws , i've heard that too . did you know tat kellan moore is the only lef thanded quarterback in tye nfl at this time ?"
4915,"i would think there woul dbe more than one at this tme q ! who knmew ? ,eft handed peo0ple are special ! !"
4916,"another interesting fact is that the circular huddle used in today's american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so that the other team could not read hi hand signa;s . amazing ."
4917,"very good idea , specially if your hard of hearing . do you like avkcado icecreanm ? tom brady loves it !"
4918,it's actually very creamy and sweet if you make it correctly . go tom brady and the new england patriot s. i like him . did you hear that the highest score ever in a football game occured in1 916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 to 0 ?
4919,"really , i haven' ttried it yet , but i like avocados so i think i would if there is 4nough sugar . hard to underztan da score getting that high ! i tmust have seem3d forever for hte losing team ."
4920,"i know , right ? did you also hear that alex smith took so many ap texts in high shcool that he entedred the university as a junior ? he received his bachelor's degree in two yesrs . that was quick !"
4921,"he must be a fasr learner . maybe he's got photographic memory ! yes , go tom brady and the patriots , they ghavd a devo6ed group of fans ! ! good chatt !"
4922,"thank you , i thought o tioo . have a great nght ."
4923,"good thing that jaguars decided against cousins , he wants too much mony . do you watch football ?"
4924,yes i do ! curt co9usins is greed and selgish
4925,"he used to play here for the redskin s. i think he is a good qb , but i'm surprised by how much salary h ecommands ."
4926,"well , there are not many qbst o choose from , som aybe that's why"
4927,"yteah , i can see that . it didn't make a difference for washington though . they haven't been very good since they were owned by san snydesr"
4928,yeah that's for sre ! that's crazy that keelan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl
4929,"it sort of reminds me of pitche4s asw ell . lefty's are pretty rare to begin with , ande asier to bqt against if you are a 4ight hancer . but still only 1 left hander in the nfl s3eems reall smal; ."
4930,yup ! how about tom bradyn ever getting to paly on his hs losing season ?
4931,i didn't know tha . he's a really good qb . he also is rarely injured . i think that is a big part of being successful .
4932,"definitely is ! i like blkae bortles , he actually lived in th etowj i live in"
4933,"h'es pretty good . i live in hte dc area , it is not unc9ommon to see the players out at some of th elocals ports bars . i've sewn cousins out multiple times ,"
4934,oh that's cool ! i would love to see a female kicker i nthe nfl
4935,it would be interesting . i'm sure thee are robbaly a few qualified candidates .
4936,i am sure too ! can you believe only 21 minutes ofa ctual playing time ?
4937,"yeah , i can believe it . the plays happen pretty quickly . when i was in high school there was a girl on the football team ."
4938,oh yeah ? my high school had a girl obn the 6eam and a boy on the cheerelaxder team ! lol
4939,george w . bush was a amle cheerleader for his collegwe i think . i didn't know that engineer's make more than the averate ml bplayer . nfl i can believe .
4940,"well , they need to do a bette rjob at spreading out their salaries over ti,e instead of living in access"
4941,"yseah , i also think they don't save and invest their earnings properly over tie and it hurts them in the longf run . clinton portis now drives an uber here around in dc ."
4942,really ? wow . . . talk about poor money management ! funny how a saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if a saints player comes in
4943,"yeah , they have all kinds of rules like that for cheerleaders . one the players hete in dc , crhis cooley , gt in trouble for marrying a cheerleader from the team ."
4944,crazy ! well i am 0yt . . . een fun ! take care ! go eeagles ! ! 2 ! lol
4945,are you familiar with football ajd the nlf ?
4946,"love football but don't get yo watch it at all , hoping to see some of the sb this sunday"
4947,so you must knoa thast the nfl is one of the four major professional sports league in north america
4948,9 did i also heard there no written rule that leeps wpmen from playing .
4949,"indeed , i was especially surprised the average nlf game only has 11 min of live gaemplay"
4950,that's crazy for how much revenue it generates . now i hear ther egong to be using tracking chips in the players .
4951,"well i admit there sue is a lot of acion in those short , yet long 11 minutes . i think the chips will help coaches gather data to make better lays and better understand football , especially since rhey are putting chips in the very footbgalls themselves ."
4952,i understand teh footbal. but what's the deal with the need to put them in sholder pads .
4953,"sl rhey can see how players tend 6o move around the field , if there is gaps in the formation or how they can improve i gues s."
4954,well ok ! something about trakcing hcips makes a little nervy . di dyou knowt hat the circular huddle was created for a deaf quaterback ?
4955,"i only recently f9und out myslf . however , whats tunned me the most was the the ch3erleadera o the new orlean saints are forbidden from eatin gin the same restaurants as any nfl players . i wodner why ?"
4956,i assume that';s to deter them from fraternizing ? can't do that if youf forfed to leave the restaurant .
4957,ya nbht i wonder if there was an incident for them to be soe xtreme about it . you don't see other teams having such rules
4958,"probably was and they npped it in tuhe bud bvefore the public got a hold to it . seems bsing an engineer is pretty lucrative , even nmore so than an nfl or mlb player over there lifetime ."
4959,but i think you have to consider that most players probably work for fae less years than engineers .
4960,"yeah true that , still an honest profession . i wonder how much more they have to work to b econsider having made more money ?"
4961,"hmmm a great question . in any cfase , give your interest in football , what position do you like ? personally , i am most interestsed in the quarterbacks"
4962,"apparetly kellan moore is the only left handsd quarterback in 6he nfl , that's strange ."
4963,quite a coincidnce . i wonder if being left handed as a quarterbac kis advantageous or disadvantageous . this would really matter given that quarterbacks are the core of rhe team's offense .
4964,"yeah your right . i just remember as a kid hatignt hat the ball spun the wrong wat , haha ! iowa's coach had the visitors locker room painted pink ."
4965,"in any case , this was a pleasant covnersationa bout football . i hope you bet to see some of sb this sundzy and thank you or the chat ."
4966,"are you familiar with the nfl ? its hte most professional level, of american foobtall ."
4967,a little bit . the nfl allows women to play .
4968,yhere i sno rule that prevent female players to join the nfl .
4969,i wonder if women will join .
4970,i don't know . i would not ecnourage women to join the nfl . the sports are very rough and physical .
4971,a lot of players ge tconcussions .
4972,it' strue . their quarterbacks are pai da lot . they must be good players nad leaders .
4973,"yes , but engineers tend to make more ."
4974,i do not think so . the new qb for 49ers is paid 135 million dollars for a fiveyear contract .
4975,not all players make that much . alex smith was a junior when he entered coklege .
4976,he is a very smart guy . he got his bachelor degree jn two years .
4977,"yeah , some junior college soffer programs like that for free t9 high school students ."
4978,alex smith took mqny aqp classes at high scoo l.
4979,he was smart . a deaf quarterback invented the huddle .
4980,i heard about it . eh did notw ant th eother team to read his hand signals .
4981,i wonder if tehy could . sign language is hard to larn .
4982,"if i were a professionalt eam and there was a needt o understand sign language , i would probably hire a trnalator ."
4983,"never thought of that . evemn now , translators make a lot of money ."
4984,true . do you know that bkaer amyfield from university of oklahoma considered quitting football ?
4985,i don't blame him . it's a dangerous sport .
4986,he wawnted to pursue competitive gaming instead . he was very good at playing halo 3 .
4987,you can get paid to do that ?
4988,i really do not know how mayfield planned to make more mpney by quitting football .
4989,interesting . it was nice talking to you . good night .
4990,hey there what do you think about the dallas cownoys . do you think they have a chance this year ?
4991,"hello there , i was hooing they would have mafe it furthe rthis pzst season , we'll see though . are you a cowboys can ?"
4992,yeah il ike the cowboys a little bit . teh quarterback cam newton is a ood guy . i do think the tedskins are a formidable team though .
4993,"yeah he is , andt he redskins hqve been up and down teh last decade or so ."
4994,well hwo's y9ur favorite quarterback ? i know tha ti really like tom bracy personally
4995,"tom brzdy will go down as one of te best , if not the best . i was always a big brett favrr fan ."
4996,"oh i agree with you ! i think a lot of quarterbacks are actually really talented , like laex smith , he passed out of a lot of classes in xollege because eh did so well on the aps"
4997,yeah it sounds like alex smith coul dhave gone into plenty of different fields of he didn't choose footbal l.
4998,"yeah i agree , he almost got a master's degree before he went into thed raft , what do you think about the circular huddle ? did yiu know it was invented by a deaf quarterback ?"
4999,i think that is on of the most interesting and coolest facts about pr football !
5000,"yeah i agree wiht you , i used to play a lot of video games in college nad apparently baker mayfield was almost a professional video gam player , i didn't know tgat ."
5001,"i didn'tk now that either , i think he is really good at oned game in particular as well , do you know whicy one ?"
5002,"yeah it was halo 3 . i was actually also good at that game haha . if only we went to yte same college i could have payed him , maybe i should havw been a professional videogame player lol"
5003,"that is hialrious , i used to play a lot of halo 1 and 2 bakc whne i was in collehe . ohhhh halo 2 and milwaukee's best light beer . lol"
5004,"haha yes those weret he days ! i was theb est at halo 1 and halo 2 , buht i did play halo 3 , i ctually did win some tornamentsf or halo 1 . what would you think if you entered a locker room and i tas painted pink btw ?"
5005,"that nust have been really fun to play in tose . yehs i think i have heard that before , that is hilarious !"
5006,"yea if it's at the university of iowa , they painted the opposing team's locker room pink . i wonder if that increase or decrease their winning percejtage afterwards though ? it would make me play harder"
5007,"that is a very good question , and i want to know who gave the final o kfpor them to do that !"
5008,what other games are you good at ? are you good at bowlin gat all ? they used to mmae more than professional football players back in the 60s
5009,"io can bow la little bit , but that just goes to show how far the nfl has come since th4n !"
5010,i agree ! fo you ever watch footbll on tv ? i like knowing that espn won and emmy for the yellw line that showw first down during games
5011,i had no idea women could be in ute nfl . did you ?
5012,"i had no clue asw ell ! i am learning so much from these chat hits ! i dont keep up with football in generall , do you ? do you have a favorite team ?"
5013,not really but most of my friends are into it . it seems a bit boring . 11 mkinutes of gamd play7 on average seems small .
5014,"yeah . i like going to football games , the envikornment is really exciinb . watching it on tv is real.ly boring . my whole family loves football . im not really into it either . this is interesting ht0oug h: nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a playerd every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , balls peed and location ."
5015,wow ! that i wa sunawaee of . although it makes sense as technology can help figure out what theyn eed to work on . probbaly why they get paid so much buyt apparently an enginee rmqkes more in a lifetime thna a pro baller .
5016,"wow , that is crazy cosnidering footbsal players are prettym uch putting their health and safety at risk all the time ."
5017,i know . kind of funny that its the quarterback that gets the most atte3ntion when the ther sseem to put more wear and tear on their bodies .
5018,"right ! except this , its pretty impressive : superbowl winning quarterback , brad johnson , is the only quarterback in nfl history to throw a touchdown pass . . . to himself ."
5019,how is that even possible ? i just found out that the huddle was created because a deaf quarterback could yive hand signalsw ithout the other team seeing . personall6y i am more impressed that he is deaf .
5020,thats insane . but thats nicet hat the nf. was willing to make a huddle to acckmodate that player !
5021,"yeha , that was pretty cool of them . do you watch any college ball ?"
5022,"not at all ! i only watch the 49ers games and the superbolw . but really i know nohting about teh gam e, i just cheer when i hear ' touchdown '"
5023,"yeah , i dont either . i ead onde that nfl cheerleaders don ge tpaid by the nfl lthough im not sure how true that is ."
5024,"right , they dont even get paid fore xpemses for traveling to the game , i think . they get paid from some cheerleafding krganization . i knew a cheerleading coach . that seems hard as a career ."
5025,"apparetly bew orlewns saints cheerleaders are forbidden to b3 seen eatign in the same restaurant as a player and if a player comes in a restaurant hey are eating at , the cheerleader hast o leave . that se3ms rude to me ."
5026,"wow , what sthe deal with that ? i thought we were past segregation . lol"
5027,"lol ! i know , right ? i actually was at a dennys onc ewhen a saints player came in with his agent after a game . dindt see any cheerleaders though and to be honest , wanst all that impressed ."
5028,"did you know , those humongous american flags at football stadium,s weigh 1 , 010 pounds and cost 50 , 000 tok make . really ? thats crazy amount of money to spend on a flag ."
5029,that is insnae ! i wonder 2ehre they get them from .
5030,"probably etsy , hahz . yeah im not sure . just a ridiculous fact about football lol"
5031,"i hear ya ! well , have a good night !"
5032,"hi , how are you ov4r there ? re you feeling good ?"
5033,"hi ! yes , pretty great thank you ! just fionished watching some football videos . are you a fan of football ?"
5034,"i do not usualluy watch the football . it is violenc e, and my household does not truck sith violence on tv , only in person ."
5035,"haha ! i agree it is a very aggressive sport . which got ,e wonderingw hy i hadn?t seen any female football players did you know there are currently no written rules against female players in th enfl ."
5036,"i think that violence against women woulkd be an queer spectator sport , even in america . is there a sport with violeme against the women ?"
5037,"um , no i don't tfhink so , but did you know an average nfl game is only 11 minutes of gameplah ?"
5038,thats scandalous . hterre should be some sort of law about minimal wokr time or something .
5039,"yes , it makes me ponder how much times have changed . back in the 60's top bowlers made twic eas much as top football stars ."
5040,how much money wast hat exactly ? i dont think either of the mgrlups made much . i guess the bowlers got all the women and the glory though . they were graceful ahtletes .
5041,"i, not sure , but yexs there seem to be a lot of irregularities within the sport dfor inmstance new orlezns saints cheerleaders are not allowed to be in the same restaurants as nay of the players ."
5042,"i think thats a sexist form of misogyny ors eomething qlong those lines . the mne should be chival,rous and elave the women ."
5043,"to each their own ik suppose , speaking of lines , that super imposed yellowl ine yous ee in the game , sspn ha swon an emmy for that . did know taht was possible ."
5044,i think espn should try to put a line where th cheerleaders are so that they dont have problems with players . thatw ould be vhivaleou sof espn . what does espn stand for ?
5045,"i think people should jus thave some common sense but i don't see that happening naytime soon . then l uses tracking devices to trakc players on teh field , im sure that a way to kdep tabs on players"
5046,i think they could track tehm off tge field too . too many of them guys get ijto all kinds of crimonal mischief . they need some help .
5047,"in that case the whole world would be tracked , i think wec an thjink of bette rways than to ' control '"
5048,"nfl players are role models for many young people . i am not . i cannot speak for you . i figure tha tif rhey don't ge tinto trouble , tey dont need tracking . but some of them , . . i dunno ."
5049,"thats a whole other subect w edont have enough time here for . but this would be a whole different palce i more love was implemented the current system has people going crazy and violence is out of hnad , we mst look within oneelf ."
5050,i suppose that we are running out of time . the nfl should invent a chip to hlp up look withi nourselves not just track each other . wha tis inside ? chips might just help us there .
5051,"id isagre e, we have everything we nee dto look within ourelf . . . you woudl jus tbe giving your power away by allowing to get chipped . someone 4else in cotnrol of you and your decision . this plante would no longer be free will . the nfl should just stick ith tracking balls to track speed and rotatio"
5052,"i fesel lost sometimes ande am willing to try the chips . i trust the science of the soul . anyway , thanks for the heart tp heart chat . peace ."
5053,"meditate , i feel th3e same way ! but haves founda nswers looking within , you need nohing else , cbange your vibration and your outlook in life and life will reciprocate . itll be challenging but its worth it . then abd only then yoh will be free . nice fhatting wiht you too ! namaste . in love and light ."
5054,"i love football , but not a big fan of th epanthers . how about you ? are you a fan of the nfl ?"
5055,i dont know th game very well . you dont like the panthers ? why not ?
5056,"well , im not just not a fan of the quarterback cam's attitude . although theor offense is on point lately ."
5057,i guess teh quarterbakc is the most prominent person on tbhe team . hes ets te tone of a lot of things .
5058,"whay it amounts to is he really only had a couple of exceptional season . he convinced everyone he is superman ,t hat is his nickname ."
5059,so he is past his peak . didnt his team play in thes uperbowl recently ? i think ir emember they lost .
5060,they based everythng o0n a guy who cant hold his tejper . he acts out when he cant throw and blames ohters .
5061,so much of the gam'es success depenfs on personality and integrity . cant teach tha . either you got i or you dont .
5062,"yep , i agree with you . some people like cam are nokf ready for the long career . turner began to take th epressure off am by scjeming more theows tot e running backs ."
5063,"you gottra work with the players you have , not hte ones you want . the nfl is an interesting study in personality . i wohder how women would fare in the nfl ."
5064,"yeah , good question . yak now the nfl does niot have a rule againsg women playing ."
5065,"ivd heard as muhc . i figure if a woman could do the job , theydh ire he r. i just dont think it will happen ."
5066,i think anythinb is possible but no women have met the leagues eligibility requirements yet . the size of the me nate so big i would have to be a really samazon type of women .
5067,"yes , maybe genetic engineering will help us out there . it will be like starship troopers . that would be fun ."
5068,"oh yeah , ha cool . ya know the new orleans saints cheelreaesrs can not be at thse same restaurant with the football players . if they are in the sams palce the heerleaders have to leave immediately . wow"
5069,"htat rule must come from somewhere , but i cant figure out where . was there a problem with romantic relationships ? strange outdated rule ."
5070,"oh yeah , thats' a good point . maybe it has something to do with that . i know that games go by toof ast for me , heing a big fan , i want to see mrs play time ."
5071,"yeah , i hear you . 11 minutes sounds like a rip off . i figure that teh union got involved ! lol"
5072,"haha , i want the wjole two and a hal fhours of play time . laex smith is such a good qb that e might extend the games with how smart he is . he was abld to get his bachelors in two years . it usually takes four yearz ."
5073,"yeah , he really was bright and focused . more students should do that and get through faster . anyway , great chat !"
5074,"i know and i agree with the fsct taht the players need to focus on educatiob and football . bak3r mayfield almost too kit too far by focusing on gaming and wasn't gonna go for football but rather try to be a professional gamker , ges h. lol . have a good one ."
5075,i have an article about football . you ?
5076,i'm s fan of fooball . i coul ddo with less commerfials though . they have like 11 minues of live gamepaly in ths veage broadcast .
5077,isn't that crazy ? th junpero derra high school jv fdootball team recorded a historically bad seawson in which they failex to win a game or eve nscore a touchdown yet theu never attempted to start their backup quarterback .
5078,yeah he waa tom brady . weird .
5079,"i6t's crazy ! ale smith took so many ap tests in high scjool that he entered university as a junior . the quarterbaco received his bachelor's degree ih two years , and began working on a master's degree , befor becoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft ."
5080,smart guy . speakibng of colelge the university f uowa ha sa pink locker oom . i thjnk you'd always remember that one .
5081,"yes , you would know what to expect ! the circular huddle used in todays american footbawll was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not read his han dsignals ."
5082,innovative . the nfl tracks everythimg wiht chips embedded in the players pads .
5083,"they like to get alot of info ! the quarterbakc is usually considered the leader of the offensve team , and is often responsible for calling the play i nthe huddle ."
5084,did you know there's only one lefthanded quarterback in the nf l?
5085,"no ! the quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive pay , and is the offensive player that almost always throws forward passes ."
5086,"that's a lot of responsibility . baker ayfield , qvb and oklahoma , almost quit football to be a professional video gamer . i wodner if he played madden at all ?"
5087,"no idea ! sports commonly called football in certain places include association football , knpwna s soccer in some countries , ; gridiron football , specifically akwrican football or caandian football , ; australan rules football ; rugby foltball , either rugby league lr rugby union , ; and gaelic football"
5088,itneresting . there are a lot of definitions . i'm assuming they all kick a ball at some point .
5089,me too ! fodrmer partuots rb benja4rvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
5090,nice handd ! i wonder if frisky hands is hy new orleasn cheerleaders and the4 foobtall team can't eat at the same restauant .
5091,"thats a good question ! p; ,"
5092,sometimes wish i could get more gaems than the 16 games in the nfl season .
5093,"i thin kalot of peopl efee, that way . espn won an emmy tor the creation of the sxuperimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games ."
5094,very coo l. i wonder if any women will ever p;qy in ghe nfl . there's nothing in the rules that says they can't .
5095,that would be funt o see ! different variations of footbal lare known as football codes .
5096,yeah it would . it h8ink there's more money as ane ngineer though over your lifetime .
5097,what nfl team does colt mccoy curently play for ?
5098,mccoy plays for washington . he ahs been in washington for years .
5099,how much did he sign for in his mos trecent extension ?
5100,he cold get up to 7 million dol.ars . not bad for being a backup .
5101,"not at all ! there was some sort og playing clause in it , wasnt' there ?"
5102,i sure there are some playing incentives to get to the full 7 million .
5103,i thouhgt htere was something about mccoy possibly becoming a free agent .
5104,"he has stuck with the redskins through rgiii nad kirk cousins , and is now behind alex smith . he seems happy there ."
5105,"i suppose so , particu,arly after being drafted y dcleveladn ? do you remember which year that happened ?"
5106,2010 amybe . mccy is one of about z zillion qbs' drafted by the browns .
5107,that's pretty funny ! he awent somewhere else before oming to washkngton . do you know whyere ?
5108,he also spent some time in sf . buy he is happy ow with the eedskins and coac jay gruden .
5109,"i can se etha , although he wants to be a starter . his 2014 run wasn't great though . know any of his stats from that year ?"
5110,mccoy was 13 ax a starter in 2014 . ther eis a reason he is a backup .
5111,"true , althoug hyou never know . have you heard about the junipero serra high sch9ool jv backup qb ?"
5112,"yes , ot's the high school htat refusedt o start tom brady , even though they failed to score a touchdown the entire seqson ."
5113,pretty amazing ! how many teams are in the national football league anyway ?
5114,"there are 32 teams , divided evenly into the natioal foobtlal conferenc e, nfc , and the american footballc onference , afc , ."
5115,"after a 17week season , the playoffs end this eeek before tehir bih game . what is 8t called again ?"
5116,"some call it the esuper bowl .b ut if your a commercial businhess adn haven't signed a licensing agreement with the nfl , you have to call it '; the big gme ' . ha !"
5117,"5hat's pretty funny ! a logn way from the 1960's , when bowlers madew twice as much ass football stars ! thanks fo all this great infomratikn !"

5132,ah yeah that would definitely make it tough . have you paid any attention to some of the nfl rule changes over the3 last couple of 6years ?
5133,yeah . what do you have in mind . . .
5134,what ared your thoughts on the enw helmet rule when making contact ?
5135,my head understands it but my heart wants to see bone crushing hiys . at the sawme time seeing the older nfl players struggle in daily life ist oiugh . . .
5136,"yeah , i agree . it's kin dof like going to a hockey game and they can only slap eahc other lol . similar thoughts on the roufhing the passer changes ?"
5137,fhe qbs are protected pretty well so i would liek to see some rules to help the def . . .
5138,that's an interesting thought i've never thought about it from the other side . do you have anthing specific in mind ?
5139,"npt really but there are times when the def is flagged for a simple hit that shouldn ot eb flagged . any way , thank you so much for the chat . i relaly enjoyed thi sone . i hope we get paired in the future . . ."

5146,"patriots for sure lo , toob ad the bears didnt make it , im counting the days for sunday ."
5147,what are you doing for the game
5148,gathering with friend swhat about you ? doing anything special ?
5149,"no , i love to cook game day food so i will cook some wings and gumbo or jambalaya and eat that . i do not like watching with people because they ask me too many questions . i like to use the commercial breaks to relax , get food org o potty and everyone wants to watch those instead and i ges tyelled at to sit down so i stopped being social for that game ."
5150,"yeha i get you , it can be stressful specially if your gahering a your home , you know the saints cheerleaders have to leave if a player arrives to a restaurant ."
5151,seems sexist ! are you staying at your place or going somewhere else ?
5152,"stwying at my place , but its only a few ofg us eo i dont think it would be stresful ."
5153,that's nice . my wife loves to have people over for the gamews but hates the games . seems weird to me but sne just into havign fun .
5154,"thats funn lol , i bet she doesnt know about the tracking chips playefrs have in their should3r pads , htats a cool fact i will share sunday for sure ."
5155,seh eoesn't know about those chips but she knows baout doritos and fritos ! ! ! so good . . .
5156,"i guess thays a better thing to know lol , you know the average gameplay is of only 11 minutes ! !"
5157,tha's a short time . kellan moore is the only left handed dqb in the nfl .
5158,really ? i would have thought there werea t least a couple more !
5159,"yeah , me too . do you ,ike baker mayfield ?"
5160,"i do like him , i thihk he is a great player ."
5161,me too ! nice chatting ith you and good luck this weekend !
5162,did you know that there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl .
5163,"wow , pnly ohe impressive , i am left handed and i would be a minority in the nfl"
5164,"yes jndeed , lol . do you know who baker mayfield is ?"
5165,i have . i think he is theq b fromk the university of oklahoma
5166,indeed he thought at one time to leave football dor competitive gaming . apparently he had a favorite game . do you know it ?
5167,he wad pretty good in halo 3 . . . by the way do you know how the circular huddle was created ?
5168,i though it was so the othjer player couldn't see what the qbw as saying .
5169,"it was cfated by a deaf qb pau, d hubbard ! !"
5170,o hok that makes sense as well . you know theres no written rule that prevents women from playing in the nfl ?
5171,"wow , i wonder if any women had tried ! ! they could earn more money by bneing engineers !"
5172,"yeah over thw long naul , i would rathe rdo 101 years on the field and leave with my millions tan 40 plus . what baout you ?"
5173,exactly i would do the same as you ! hey did you know what they did in the university of iowa visitors locker room ?
5174,too funny somebody told me that the looker room is paintyed pink . trhat would just make me mad .
5175,"that is funny intimidation , more like a joke !"
5176,right i think they thought they were goin gto intermediatet he other team . you know the average game only has 11 minutes of life game play ?
5177,"wow , soundst oo short . . butr the whole show with the stops is very enjoyzble to me and now is more interesting with data that is tracked by chips"
5178,yeah and tne tracking chips are in hte shoulder pads as weol . soon will be watching a . i . 's playing .
5179,looks like we are going in that direction ! did you know bowlers earnec more than football player sin the 60's ?'
5180,yeah o was told twice as much that?s crazy ! how agout ths rule about new orleans ceherleader . have you heard about this sexist thing ;
5181,ot is terrible ! ! they cannot eat where any nfl players dat ! !
5182,right and if there already eating and a player comes in then they go to get a dogg6 bag .
5183,awful ! ! so unfair . tha tshould not be hwappenign !
5184,do you know who played the highest scoring college game in histoy ?
5185,thag wa smore than 100 years ago ! it was georgia tech an dcumberland
5186,yyp 2200 that hurts iw oud have hated to be on the bus ride home .
5187,that is so sa dfor cumberlan d! ! well it has been a nice chat !
5188,it was have good day !
5189,"who do you like ebtter , the falcns r redskins ?"
5190,"i am not relaly a football fan , how about you ?"
5191,"i likef ootball , but i'm not as big of a fan as i used to be . . . i play fantasy football a lot though , so i follow the league pretty closely ."
5192,interesting . i heard in the season that the redskins won rhree and a row after a terribel loss to the saints
5193,"yeah , the redskisn are a good team . they have a running back nmaed adrian peterson who is very good . at one tiem he was the best player in thel eague , but is now old and close to retirement ."
5194,hs is the nfl's leading rusher an dwasn't evne in the team's plans ubtl late august . he's a big par tof the offense .
5195,"yes he is ;d o you feel washington's offense i sgood enough to keep up w9ith matt ryan , julio jones , and the res6 of atalnta's high powe5ed offense ?"
5196,i have no idea but redskins secojdary has struggled against the pass . i?e heard that but not sure hwat that means . can you enlighten me ?
5197,"sure , altant ahas one of tnhe best quarterbacks in the league , matt ryan . he is very good at passing theb all . ufnortunately , washington has a very poor defense and are jota ble to defend against teams that pass the ball well . the ' secondary ' are the defensive playedrx responsible for deedning the pass ."
5198,"wow , thwank you for the xplanation . apparently washington recently made a trade to boost its defensive backfield , to get safety haw ha clintondx ."
5199,"yes , he came over to washington from green bay . since washington's defense was so poor , they decided to trade for clintondix , who os very good at defend9ign aainst a passing offense . unfortunately , quinton dunbar is injured with a nerve ssue in his lower leg . i'm not sure if clintondix will be ehough to stop atlanta ."
5200,"yeah , i heard he is a ohysical defendeer who can fly to the bal land kind of limit atlanta's receivers' comfort ."
5201,"sven though atlanta will be passing the ball a lot , i suspect washingtn w8ll pdiamr8ily run hte ball . atlantwa has bee struggling thiz season and washington is very good at running the footbal l."
5202,"if the redskins let ryan stand in their pocket , it mihgt be a challnge for them ."
5203,do you understand what it means to ' stand in yhe pocket ? '
5204,i have a slight idea but perhaps you can enlighten me again !
5205,"when a 1uarterbakc has the blal and wanting to pass it to a receiver , he has five temamates on the offensive line thzt is protecting him from being tackled . the barrier these five offensive lineman create is called ' teh pocket . ' if they do their job , the quarterback can stay inside of the pocket and deliver a good lass . if not , he will hbzve to try to run and get away ."
5206,you are awesome at explaining things . mayne if you were around on game days i could actually unfderstand football ! i only wathc durign te super bowl . i guess i will wait to watch my next gaem the first sunday of next february .
5207,"football can be somewhat intimkidatingt o try and understand , but the rules are fairly essy . knowing that there ar eno rules against women paying in the nfl , do you ever think a woman will play ?"
5208,i actually read about a woman kiker who is playing on the men's dollege football tezm . maybe shed is our next hope .
5209,it woudl eb fun to see a woman in the nfl . the kicker is a good position for the first woamn to play . they rarely get tackled and have rules protecting how hard the6 can get hit . i still feel tgat a very strong woman culd play another position and tackle just as well as the men could .
5210,"i hope so . the nfl seems a bt sexist though . i kn0w football ppayers are more important but still , when new orleans saints cheerleaders are already eating in a restaurant , theyh wve to leave if saints playe5s com einto the destaurant ."
5211,hello are yolu a football fan ?
5212,hi how are you ? somdtimes i follow football . you ?
5213,i do a likttle bit . did you know the highest score in a football game was 2220 nothing . thats a lot of points .
5214,what happened there ? the winning coach sluld be ashamed . what is tye point of that drubbing ?
5215,tyhgat is crazy . you never know though . he may have put his thir string in ahd thwy were still just way bettr .
5216,"yeah , that's true . i wonder why cuvmerland scheduled hfat game . no point ."
5217,i bet they didnt schedule it again for awhile . lol . in the 1960s top bowlers mad emore than football stars . that i really hqard to believe .
5218,hte nfl was just starting o7t wnd i guess the fan base was not bi enough . plus the players probbaly dindt hav ea union
5219,"ij ut cant see bowling being somethjing peoplew ould really watch . it is fun to play , but i dont know about watching ."
5220,"i hguess the fans followed the sport ebcause thehy play7ed as wwll . probably a lot of local leagues , and that raised interest in pros ."
5221,hey ezpn one a emmy for the yellow lien that shows where first down is .
5222,that is amazing ! an award for a line ? must have been a soft year for awards . lol
5223,it 2was a really good idea . it will probab;y still b ebeing used wuen every actor alive today is dead .
5224,"yes , it is a standard part o the broadcast . i cant imagine the game without the superimposed graphics ."
5225,it sure i . so what do you thin kabout the university of iowa painting thev isting lockerr oom pink ?
5226,"i figure that it has some effect , but is it enough to mattert ? if so , thgen every team would do 8t ."
5227,so no rule about women n football . do you think it will ever happe n?
5228,i wonder . maybe at soe positions that would be ok ? like kicksr or punter ?
5229,"maybe . there is only about 1 1minutes ofa ctual gameplay . kicker is , what ? 1 pedcent 0f that ?"
5230,"yeah , not much contac for the kicker . probably pretty safe at the high school level too . anyway , great chzt !"
5231,you to . have a grea tray .
5232,good mo4ning to you !
5233,hi . do you like sports ? do you likd football ?
5234,"i enj9y some football , afre we talking about amerivan football or european football ?"
5235,american footbapl . especially the nfl national football league . do you have a favorite team oc the 32 ?
5236,"i do , i root for the pats . how about you ?"
5237,i do no5t know mucn about football . i do know about the patriots . i larned that the quarterback with the most wins was nen roethlisberger for the pittsburgh steelers .
5238,"hes pretty good , hes bne a teamj staples for asl ong as i can remember . hes a great qb"
5239,i learned that kellan moore is the only lef thanded quarrtetbck in the nfl . i htought there woulc be more .
5240,i wonder why hgat is . do you think it has to do with how they have to turn their body to throw ?
5241,that is a great point . i did not think of it that way . there is a quarterback who threw at ouchdown pass to himself !
5242,imagien how coolt hat would look ? i bet he felt so bad ass when hs did that
5243,and dud you know htag there are only 2 african american quarterbacks to have wo nthe superbowl ?
5244,which is surprising to me because the nfl is pretty diverse . did you knowt here is nothing in the rules that says a womam cant play ?
5245,thay is geat to know that anyone can 0lay . evn a rocket scientyist is coaching in the mnfl .
5246,i bet he some prett gfeat deas and strategies for hi seam !
5247,i bet he knows a lot about the humongo8us amerjcan flags at th4e stadium that weigh 1100 pounds .
5248,is that how much that thing weghs ? good god i cant imagine seeing what it looks like all folded up !
5249,"yes and they cost 50 , 000 dollars to make ! that is one hsfty flag !"
5250,59k ? ? ? ? i min the wrong business !
5251,wll thanks s0 much for chatting l. i learned a lot about football today .
5252,"likewise , take care"
5253,do you watch the nfl ? i think it is the best form of any of the different types of football !
5254,hi ! i do watch when i can but yes i love the nfl .
5255,awesome ! i am not a huge ravens fan but i think tjhat it would be interesting ifg flacco was replaced by lmar jackson .
5256,i agree ! lamar jackson is a great quarterback and that would be a treat fit !
5257,yeab definitely would be fun to watch . i think quarterbacks get a lot of publicity because htey are essentially the offensive leader .
5258,"definitel7 ! lamar jackson has a really impressive recofd , he rushed 1 , 500 yards and and pass for over 3 , 000 yards in a season to bame a few !"
5259,yeah and winnign the heisman trophy is no easy feat either ! the ravens playbook should cater to jacksons strengths .
5260,"my thoughts exactly , th dendl should be proud to ahve him as a quarterback . he will b eintroduced into some new schejes they ave going so he willb e evwn better ."
5261,yeah . i also enjoy football because it i sas family sport . it's crazy that there is only 11 minutes of actuala ction in an nfl game .
5262,"it is a great family sport , and true so little actual live play f0r so many hours n a game . i like to watch the quarterbacks the most , tom brady is also fantastic ."
5263,"yeah tom brady is a champ , definitely oje of the greats ! apparrntly the circular huddle was developed fior a deaf quarterback . interesting that it stuck ."
5264,"i read about that , prett amazing and smart ! fooball and the nfl history is full of run facts !"
5265,yeah . and ther eis only one left handed quarterbackkellan moore . must not bet hat much of a good thing otherwis there woul dbe morr !
5266,"i would think being left handed in footba,ll would be very challenging . i wonder if the trackign devices are the same when placed in a left handers shoulder pads ."
5267,good question . baker mayfield almost quit football to be a competitive gamer can you believe that ? these players are so talented in many things .
5268,right ? they have optiosn which is great . i find it interesting taht an engineer makes more money in their lifetije than an nfl player . . . . crazy !
5269,yeah that is surprising . engineers are really smart but i still would want to b ean fnl play4r .? just more fun and exciting even if im ake less money .
5270,"true ! although being an nfl player your chances of injry are so hign and you can't play that hard for too many years . i also heard that pro bowler smade twic ethe money as a football player years ago hahaa , weird !"
5271,haha bowling is definitely fun but i would never uess it would be lucrativ e. i wonder how much they make nowadays ?
5272,"i agree ! do they even have pro bowling anymore ? lol , havwn't seen that in awhile . i will stick to watching the nfl haha"
5273,haha same . well it was nice talking with you ! have a great night !
5274,"case keenum , the next broncos quarterback . he had a great year for the vikings in 2017 ."
5275,he has a coo lname . i hope he performs up to hi sname for elway's broncos !
5276,"nhe's been mediocre his whole career , then hd a career season with minnesota ."
5277,makes you wonder why the viings assed on making him their franchise player .
5278,i think they believe 201 7was a fluke . minnesota has its eyes o nkirk couins .
5279,"so keenum moves on with free agency , just like his fellow vikigns , bradford and bridgewatertwo other cool names ."
5280,"denver was loadedw ith mediocre qb's in 2017 , too . siemian , lynch , osweiler ."
5281,"yeah , and they traded up in the 201 draft to gey lynch , and that did not work out for them ."
5282,"looks like denver won'td raft a qb for 2018 with keenum in hand . fhat will be good for the bills , who are trading up ."
5283,"ah , the bills . searching for that fifth super gowl loss . just like elway sa8d about denfer , buffalo needs to get bette rat thatr spot too , qb that is , ."
5284,you need a good quarterback to do well . look at how denver has fared sicne peyton manning retir3d .
5285,true . brings a tear to my eye rem3mbering elway nd manning in the orange jeresey . .
5286,"gm elway htinks the broncos are close , and keenum could put them in super bowl contentin ."
5287,yeha . i guess the nfl will be putting a chip in keenums shoudler pads in denver soon to monitlr his psition on the field . hopefully he will stay in denver long enough l make it on hte field .
5288,or jmaybe denver will use keenum to groom a new young quarterback .
5289,"that could happen . teh orange could use matt patrica as coach , the only rocke tscientist in the nfl ."
5290,"yes , the nfl takes all kinds . there are no rules against women playint ."
5291,"yeah . if patricia writes the play s, he takes inspiration from his old rpi fihgt son g, where they mention such footballsavvy tersm as sine , cosine , and tangnet ."
5292,maybe patrici ashould have stuck with rocket science . engineeds earn more lifetime thant he average nfo player l
5293,"yeha , and if you have a bad record , it lives in statistical infamy forever . liek the poor clevelan dbrowns . the qb with ther most wins in their stadium is not even from their own team , but from their rivals , the stelers' roethlisberger ."
5294,"mayb ethe browns can get baker mayfiel d. he is excellent at competitive gaming , and mighg make their game competitive ."
5295,"hi thjere , do you watch the nf ?"
5296,"yup . i don't know why , but i do enjoyt his game . 32 teams doesn't seem like enough ."
5297,yeah i know . did you know wome ncan play if they qualify ?
5298,"yeah . which conference do you think will gbe the first to have a woman , afc or nfc"
5299,"i wonder about taht , qe will have to wait and xee i guess . do you know therd re only 11 minutes ofd game play ?"
5300,"17 gruelong weks , wild card weekend , the playofs , and then the superbowl , and all of tehm only 11 minu8tes each . doesnm't sound super . . ."
5301,i know . did you hear about that rule with new oleans cheerladers ?
5302,"yeah , what ; s the deal with that ; doesn't sound fair . but neither does having to wear trackign chips to molnitor your everym o e! nfl even puts those vhips in the balls to measure speed , rotation , etc . sounds a bit overkill for 11 minutes . . ."
5303,"yeah wen you think of it that way . ans t5hat rule is so sexit , i wonder hpw thney still get away wkth it"
5304,"the league is not made up o frocket scientists . . . well , except for matt patricia . . ."
5305,yeah talk about a career change . do you know wjat the highest score in football is ?
5306,"are we talking about cheerleaders again ? the high school stadium in allen , tx seats 18 , 00o0 and costs about 60 millin .h ow i taht for as core ?"
5307,"wow that is a lot of money . the highest score was actuallyu 2220 , what a win and a loss at the same tume"
5308,i wish i had a recording of that gam4e ! you know those huge flags that display in stadiums can weigh as much as 1100 lbs ? it probably takes the whole team to put them away eachu night . . .
5309,"wow that is super heavy . u of iowa visitor ,ocker room is actually painted pink i wonder why ?"
5310,to hide the pigskin ? lol you know snop dog wrote a fight song fir his son's high school football team ? that will gett he crowd rocking !
5311,that s for sure . did you know espnw o nan emmy once ?
5312,"waht fo r? let me guess , they wete acting like fhey knew what they we5e talkinf about ? brad johnsond eerves an emmy . . . he is the only supeebowl winnng qb to have thrown a pass to himself !"
5313,i would have liked to see fhat actually . theh won it for the yellpw superimposed line
5314,"ok . i accept that . just like brad acceter his own pass ,a nd then scored a touchdown ! see me doing my end zone dace ?"
5315,haha yeah he must have made headxpinesw ith that . it was nice chatting wit hyou
5316,"hi , how are you doing ?"
5317,great . are you a football fan ?
5318,why yes i am . how about you ?
5319,did you know that alex smitht ook so many ap classes that he entered college ss a junior ?; smar tquarterback !
5320,"no , id idn't know that , but it's prbably a good thing eh went to colloege . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the averae lifetime earnings of an fnl player ."
5321,omg ! and the injuries ! tom brady is an amazing qb but in high shcool he was the back up that didnt get to play . i am sure that coach is sorry now !
5322,"yewah , i bet that coach has taken alot of ribbing ovcer the years about not playing the goat ."
5323,what diesg oat mean ?
5324,"greatest of la ltime , tom brady . 4 time sperbolw champion lol"
5325,"ohhhh . speaking of qbs , did you know htat there is only one left handed one ? kellan moore ."
5326,"yeah , i would have thought there was more than one , but hey that must give him some kin dof adantage , i'm sure ."
5327,i also dkd not knowt hat the huddle came from a deaf qb that didnt want hte other team to read his sign language . interesting ?
5328,"yeah , that is interesting . but do you know there is a playe rthat has never fumbled the ball in hi sentire nfl career ?"
5329,i cant imaginew ho it is ? is he playing now ?
5330,"no , formwr patriots rh benjarvus greenellis . mist have been very hard to accomplisj that ."
5331,"what an acco,plishmen t. dud you know the highest score in football was georgia tech in 1916 ? they scored 222 points ."
5332,"whoo , that's alot points . i don't think that would happen nowadays . i watched the superbowl and it was the lowest scoring superbowl ga,e ever ."
5333,boring ! and a half hours and the average nfl gam eonly has 11 minutes of gameplay . who knew ?
5334,"i know , but ye twe watch anyway . lol"
5335,no wonder the announcers talk so much ! and there is no rule against woen playing in the nfl . they just have to meet eligibility requirements .
5336,"that would be cool . well it's beej nic echatting , i need to go walk my dog , talk to you later , friend ."
5337,i think the qb i sthe most important player on the filed .
5338,most definitely ! how are you today ?
5339,i am great what about you ? do you lime football ?
5340,i do like football . im a steleers fan . what about you ?
5341,i do like it and laso trivia do you know whsts the highest score ever ?
5342,222 to 0 back in 1916 ! the losing team must have been asleep !
5343,"sleep or all blind , who loses by that much , an average nfl game only hs 11 minutes of gameplay ,"
5344,apparently cumberland ! hopefully tney got beter since then .
5345,"i sure hope so , did you know thers is no written rule in the nfl agaisnt woman playing in the league !"
5346,that is funny . do you think a woman will 3ver play in then fl ? i think maybe a kicker if qnything .
5347,"i dont think the7 will , men are stronger its ust a thing of nature besides they can lways get tackled as kickers"
5348,true that . crazy that rb benjarvus reen ellis never fumbled once !
5349,"i heard he wa s agreat player , never watched him plat htiugh , what teams dic he play for ?"
5350,he formerly playded for the patriots .
5351,"i see , well it amkes sense he ahd a great team , i wonder how much money he marde , i hear engineers will make more mobey than football players eventually"
5352,probably because their careers are way longer than football players i assume .
5353,"that would make sense , they do have longer careers so yeah , also f9otball players tend to have short careers"
5354,it iss urprising that only lne qb in the nfl is lsft hznded ;
5355,"only one ? wow , whats his name ?"
5356,k3llamn moore is the only left handed player .
5357,"oh i like how he playes , great fact , anywwy its been grea chatting with you i feel a lot more knowledgable naout the sport now ! thanks"
5358,nice chaqtting with you as well !
5359,"hello there , are you a fan of the nf. ?"
5360,"yeah , i uually try to watch during the playoffs . hpw wbout you ?"
5361,yeah i follow my team during the regular season and then watch most of the playoff games .
5362,in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . i wonder whch atletes were in better shape ? nogody watches bowling the same as they did then .
5363,"yeah ins't that wild , showsh ow much the sport has grow nand bowling , wekll it's bowling . i guess the thing to be was a bowler in the 60's th0ugh ."
5364,the nfl has nor ule against female players . do you thninkw e'll ever see women in the game ?
5365,"i think we will , and i think that it would be really cool if that did happen ."
5366,i could see them playing positiins like punter or kicker or place holdewr . i think those are the positions that would be most exdpected .
5367,"yeah i think those woul dbe the first ositions that we would see a female player . but , if one amde it as a regular field player , that would eb awesome ."
5368,"sh'ed have o be big , o rfast , or botb . an average nfl game has a mere 11 minutes of live gameplay . that's far less that i expected ."
5369,"yeah that seems so low , i know that you notice it a lot more when you go to liveg msaes . on tv , you don't really notice the breaks and all the stopages so much ."
5370,it would be great to se ethbe first down line project onto the actual feld . espn won an 3mmy for the creatiob o fthe superimposed yellow line . coudlw e get it at the stadium live ?
5371,yeah i wonder when they will try and do that for the fans that attend live .
5372,"we need a clever engineer tyo come up wit jthat system . an engineer's average lifetime earnings ar4 higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player . parents , don't let your kids grow up to be atletes 2"
5373,"yeah i think thed uration of the career is so much shorter for pro athletes , and they just need to know how to invest their earnings correctly !"
5374,true . they could use better financoal advice . maybd they could becom evideog ame players ike baker mayfield . there are professional video gamwe players .
5375,yeah i dnt know if i could beat him at halo 3 but maybe halo 2 i could !
5376,why are cheerleaders prohinbited from eating at the same restaurant as llayer s? that sems strange to me .
5377,that seems strange and really outdated to me . i think they need t think that over .
5378,"yeah , maybe they had a problem with romantic relationships between the two groups . anyway , i 3njoyed chatting with you !"
5379,"yeah same here , i hope you have ag ood night ."
5380,are you s fan o ffoofball ? i enjoy pro bu tnot college so much .
5381,"me too , i likse college football , but i do0n't like the idea of it . especially hokw they treat thei players"
5382,"i also disagree with the treatment of their players . speaking of college , did ylu know that the university of ilwa did to the visitinh locker room ?"
5383,"i didn'th ead , what did they do ?"
5384,they painted it completely pink !
5385,what ! no way . do you think it was to psych out their opponents ?
5386,i would assume . so steage . have you also ever heard what hte highest footballk score ever was ?
5387,"i did , it was an embarrassment , 2220 . wow . no mercy rule in football i guess , huh"
5388,i can't imaginw that . hpw is it even possible to score tha tmany points in one game ? !
5389,idk haha meanwhile we have the supervowl score not even reaching a combined 3 0pounts ! the tema with zeo must have just rolled over at one point
5390,seems to be th4 case . did you know that espn created the yellow line that shows the first down ? can you imagien watching a game on tv without that line ?
5391,it is absoputely necessary to use . i us4ed to think that line was on the field in real life too nad they kust moved it a lot . then i went to a game and fidn't see it
5392,"ha ha , that's hilarious . have you ever heard of the br benjarvus greenellis ?"
5393,the namer ings a bell but i'm not sure what he did
5394,he played for the patriots . in his entire time with the patriots he never fumbled a ball !
5395,"wow ,w hat a guy . he musth ave been a star . did you hear about baker mayfield ?"
5396,i did not . what about him ?
5397,apparently ea4rly on in his career he considered q7itting footbal lto pursue a professional halo 3 career . you don't hear htat every day !
5398,oh wow . i suppose if he is still good that he can do ita s a secodn caree rlater .
5399,"that's a big maybe , i don'tt hink the halo 3 scene is as popular antmore . i think he jade the right choice for sure"
5400,who knows when it comes to ckmpetitgive gaming . people still copete with starcraft nad that game is old .
5401,hey ! guess how the circular huddle used in football came to be !
5402,i never knew that ish ow it happene dbut that it's really neat that it is because of a deaf quarterback so the othr players could not see his hand signals
5403,yes ! i wonder how its benefitted te game outside of that . i on't actually follow footall much . i've just been reading abou5 it latley .
5404,i love football but therea re a l9t of things i did not know like tehre is only6 one left handed quarterbak in the nfl his name is kella moore
5405,"yes ! it's surprising that there's only one , givn the numbers . i wonde why ."
5406,not sure but thqt scool . i also just learned that the former patgriofs running back has never fumbled a football in his nfl career
5407,yes ! benjarvua greenellis ! bu thow much time did he spend playibg ? i wonder if he was really good lr if he just didn't play much .
5408,lol i didnt think about that
5409,"yeah , with onl 11 minute sof ac6ual play per game , and mot all o fthe palyers on the field at once , you could get through a season without being on the field or long ."
5410,true true ! did you know there were tracking devices 8in uniforms and in the actual football itself
5411,"yes , the nfl uses shoulder pads with embedded chips ."
5412,that's crazy i never would have uessed that and that the new 9lreans saints cheerleaders are not allowed to dine with the nfl playera and if they are eating already the cheerleaders have to stop eating and leave . i wonder why
5413,"yeah , requiring them to leave sounds dubious . does the nfl compensate them for the meal they miss ? why not just have some kind of communication to prevent that fom happening ? im ean since they have that rule to begin with ."
5414,"i agree , you're exactly right , you'd think they would have thought of tha tinstea dof drama haopening if they do show up at the same spot"
5415,"yeah . today , they could just hav ean app where players and cheerleaders check into a restaurant . they woulnd't have to communicate with each other , which is probably the point . it would be interesting to interview players and cheerleaders about what they think of tgat rule ."
5416,yeah it would be the smart thing to do and there are appsa for taking your dog out for a walk so you think tbeyw oudl have one for that
5417,"yeah . they could use an existing app , ike google amps , for example . i can see potential issues with teh having to leave hting , like if soemone wasn't compensated fo ra meal they dind't get to eat or if there was some kind of health issue involved ? it just seems like something that would lead to problems ."
5418,absolutely i onder why they do that like if thet eam hzd some type o fproblems with the cheerleaders stalking or something
5419,"yeah . i guess the point is so that the players nax chererleaders don't get too friendly with each othr so hte cheerleaders aren't a distraction from the players' significant others , so ever6one stays professioanl during the game , to avoid harassment of the cheerleaders or vice vers a, styff like that ."
5420,you think that would be or all the teams not just one team out of how many
5421,yeah . and people should be truwted to behave responsivly once they have suc ha prestigious jkb .
5422,they shluld be trusted to act prestigiously regardless of there job but lpeople are human and we all mess up some more then others unfodtuantely
5423,"yes .b ut with a job where you're in the public eye and there' fierce competition to get there , people should be expected to hold yhemselves to certain sgandards and if they do somethibng out of line like harassing a cheerleader just let them go and let someone else take their plaqce ."
5424,yes you're right about that
5425,"well , this has been a good conversation . hasve a great evenig wherever you are !"
5426,"hi , how are yoh ?"
5427,hi . good how are you . do you wa5ch nfl ?;
5428,i do watch the nfl . do you ?
5429,ydes je too . did you knpw women can play too ?
5430,"wow , weird . do you think they should play ?"
5431,"yes , why not . if thy can make the cut theys hould play"
5432,i agree . j am not sure i could watch it though . those players are huge .
5433,true . did you hear about that cheerleader rule in new orleans ?
5434,i did not . what is i ?
5435,they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players
5436,that' ssexist . what if they are there first ? the nfl has oinl 11 minutes of action .
5437,"i find that sezxist too . and i they are eating and the player walks in , they have to leave . weird ."
5438,"if i were them , i would dump my emal on the fooor andm ake a scen e. . ."
5439,yeah i guess they like to olige to those rules . did you know nfl players make less tahn ebgineers ?
5440,i did jot . that make ssense though since most nfl playets only .last 23 y3ras .
5441,yeah i guess . did uou know espn won an emmy ?
5442,"no , for what ?"
5443,thre creation of the superimposed yellow line
5444,wow . . . is that emmy worthy ' i feel like that's a low bar to get an emmy . . .
5445,i do no0t get it eithe r. do you lnow benjarvus greenellis ?
5446,"yes , football player who never fubmled . nice chatting with you !"
5447,good evening ! are you ready for the super bowl in aw eek ?
5448,"not reallys o bogged donw with work i haven't been able to keep up . but who's not ready for a single elimination tournament , right ?"
5449,"it'a certainly dfferent than most sports ! it's crazy to think that brady is going to another one , but back in hgh school he was t5he 2nd string on a jv tea mwhere his coach wouldn't play him !"
5450,"strange i wonder hy that was , did he dislike him ? know he's big time !"
5451,"who knows , but even most nfl teams passed o nhim with the patriots getting him in the sixth , of seven , round of the nfl draft ."
5452,and know he's a 4 time superbowl champjon .
5453,"he isg etting older . i wonder what young quarterback will be the next one to have success . baker mayfiekd m,aybe ?"
5454,is ; nt he from teh university ov oklahoma ? i hear he once consifered a carweer playing halo
5455,ye she is . can you imagine ? i wonder how close he was to becoming a profess9onal gamer . i bet he chalwges everyone around if there is a gamiong sys6tem nearby .
5456,"i would , h aha ! hqrd to believ ein thee ntire nfl there is only one left handed quarterback ."
5457,"i can remember some from the pas t, so i wonder where all the lefthanded quarterbacks are now ? do you happent o know who it is ?"
5458,"i always hated pl,ayng with a lefty , the ball spun thse wrong way . i believe his name is kellan moore ."
5459,interesting ! do you fpllpow nfl throughout the year at all ?
5460,don't ge ta chance i'm hoping to watch the sb this year . thesre is only 11 minutes of live footbal lgameplay so i should be able toc atch something .
5461,"for s long as the game takes , it's amazing that there is only that much action . they alnmost don't need to spend all that oney uwing tracking chips that rrcorde verything the player does ."
5462,tellm e about it ! did you know that here is no wrjtten rule that females an't play in the sport .
5463,"i knew some women played in college , but simce none had played yet , i wasn't sure . speaking of women in football , i heard that the new orleans cheerleaders havet o leage a restaurant if ne wirleans players ente4 it ."
5464,yeah that's probably to do with the strictness of the dating policy . i don't have anyt6hing zgainst them playing .
5465,that would be rough ! if it happens maybe they will have locker rooms decorated im pink like iowa's visiting locke room i s.
5466,that was some type of hysiological mind games he was doing .
5467,"absolutely . i am in a enighboring state that considers iowa a rival , so they definitely want to gain anye dge they can ."
5468,i doj't blame him . what about top bowlers in the 60's makung tgwice as much as fnl players .
5469,"that is crazy ! great cht , bu ti needf o run ."
5470,hi . do you like football ?
5471,"hi , how are you ? yes i like footbal, . i do not kjno wit well ."
5472,i do not knopw much about football but i definitelu know the position hte quarterbakc . i know they call the play and they yhave to touch the ball on every offensive play and they are the p;layer that uzually throws the ball .
5473,"the bq is the man , right ? the guy tha teveryone looks to save the team ? i would not want that jo b. it sounds stressful ."
5474,it sure does . there was a high school that had a really bad season and they failed to win any gajes or score any points and never usedt heir backup quarterback . the backup was tom brady
5475,that must have been before he could prove his worth . tyhe dcoach should have tried him for at least one play though . maybe he played his favorites .
5476,i think it i shard to see true talnt in high school . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he started college as a junior and go his bachelors degree in two years and started his masters before being first pick in the nfl drft .
5477,"he was a smart asmbitious guy . talent knows no bounds . he progably could be a doctor , a lawyer , an engineer ."
5478,you're right . he probably could have becoe anything h ewanted to . baker mayfield was a 1quarterback thatc onwidered quitting to pursue full time competitive gaming . his talents were a little different than others .
5479,"i would do football . more money and fam e. more injuries and concussions too , but then again ,n o guts , ni lgory ."
5480,what is interes6ing is taht the lifetime earnings of an engineer i syigher than the average nfl playe .
5481,"engineers have special skills ythat are in demand , i would rather be an sengineer because no concussins . womr nwould do better as engineers"
5482,the nfl has no rules against femal epayers . they just need to meet the league'sr equirements .
5483,"i would rather women wrnt into something useful for society . sports are good but we need engineers . anyway , thats just my opinion ."
5484,well t seems like we are a long way because new rlnas saint cheerlezders have to leave a restaurant if a football player is there
5485,i dont understand these outdated misogynistic rules . i think that they are all adult sand can deal with their business .
5486,ia gree it's just silly . like iowa paints the visiting football teams locker room completely pink . is that really necessary ?
5487,"i guess they want to psych out the ohter team . probably doesnt work or everyone would do it , yeah ? then it wouldnt work at all ."
5488,it would or kon cumebrlnad who lost to georgia tech 222 to 0 .
5489,"if cumbeeland painhted the visitors room pink , would it have helped ? i wonder what fhe gt coach was tryihg to orove ."
5490,well thanks so much for chatting . i learned a lot of new an ijteresting htings about football .
5491,do yo8 watch football ?
5492,i do . i didn't realizet hat kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl .
5493,"i?m not a big follower , but that is very interesting ! why is the quarterback is usually considered the leader of the oftensive team ?"
5494,because he calls the plays and usually touches the ball on every offensive play . there is a quarterback named russell wilson who actually has a major league baseball contract in addition to his nfl contract . i didn't know that was possible .
5495,he soudns like a go getter ! wow . i was reading about the circular huddle that is uzed in football . i had no ide ait was created by a deaf football player named paul hubbard .
5496,"that is interesting , but makes senss , so other teame couldn't see hi splays . the highest paid us department lf defwnse employees are the fkotvall coaches o fthe service branch teams !"
5497,that is so neat ! women can play in the nfl too . i had no idea !
5498,awesome ! brad johnson oince threw a touchdown pass to himself ! that would have beejn interesting to2w atch !
5499,that would ! i odner how thaqt worked ? i always wondered how much time was actually playe din football . says the average is only 11 minutes live gameplay .
5500,wow . not much at all . i wonder who will be in the superbowl the first sunday in february ?
5501,will you watch all 17 weeks to the edn ?
5502,"i don't watch cosistently , just once in a while . i didn't know the firt playorf game was in 1932 ."
5503,"isn't that crazy ? so it this . . new orleans saints cheelreaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are arleafy dining at a restaurant an an nf, playe4r comes in after , the cheerleaders are requiredt o9 leave ."
5504,that's ridiculo7us and so old fashionjed ! i didn'6 know the nfl uses trackin gdeices in players shoulder pads and in the footballs themselve to record eveything that happensd uring a game .
5505,"me either ! do you follow the colts ? do you thin, they will do well this season ?"
5506,i don't follow them . i wonder ifv they will be one o the six teams from their conference to get into the playoffs .
5507,from the article it seems tehy really want the colts to get in the playoffs .
5508,"k didn't know there were two wild card teams from each division that get jn , i though it was just one from each ."
5509,"ghis is funny though . . baker mayfield , quarterback , university of oklahoma , knce considered quitting football to purtsue fulltime competitie gaming , nad claims to be able to bea tanone at the university of oklahoma oneoone inh alo e ."
5510,quit3e a claimt o fame . college football ish uge . 14 of the world's 25 largeat stadi8ms belong to american college football teams !
5511,very cool ! merry christams !
5512,same to you !
5513,do you like football ?
5514,"yes , i like football . i especially like gong to see the live games . i jus theard about sean mcvah becoming a top nfl foac hof th eyear candidate in year 1 with the rams . pretty nsazzy ."
5515,do you like any position or player in particular ?
5516,"i like new england patriot sqb , tom brady . hes' great . i just learned thatt he quarterback touces the football o nalmost every single offensive play and is the offensive player that almost alwas throws forward passed ."
5517,i agree . the patriots are like fhe lanniusters of football
5518,"yes , absolutely . did youk now that hte average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?"
5519,yes so it shows hlw essential qb are in the offensiv eplays in that short time frame
5520,"true . did you know that the junipero serra high school jv football team recored a historically bad seaskm in which they failed to win a game or even score a touchdown yet they never attempted to start their gackuyp quartereback ? thqt backup quarterbqck they refused to start is 4 time super bowl champion , tom brady ."
5521,perhaps they just didn't want to leave a stain on brady's record at that poinbt ?
5522,"never thought of the pointofview . huh . that could very well be . speaking of quarterbacks , did you know who startedd the circular huddlse ?"
5523,wzsn't it by a deaf qb to hide his hand signals ?
5524,"yes , abd his name was paul hubbard ."
5525,another qb i follow ie kellan moore since he is a lefty
5526,"yes , apparently moor eis the only lefty uarterback in the nfl att his time ."
5527,"ya and unlike other sports , being a lefty qbh as more cohs than pro"
5528,"w0w , didn't realize that . spekaing of hands , did you kno that former platriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in hisn fl career ? wow ."
5529,that is indeed impressive and one of hte reasone i like th patriots ? a lot of amazing talen t.
5530,"snother lesset known fact about football is the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when yeofgia tech defeated cumbelrand 222 to 0 . wow , unbelievalbe ."
5531,"man i wonderd if the winners were just that god , the loser just that bad , o ra combnstion of bot"
5532,"sounds pretty bad for the cumberland guys . another fact is that back in the 1960's top bowlers made twixe as much as top football stars , wow ."
5533,"well times sure have chwnged . i mean who even watches bowlers anymore . in any case , thanks for chatting"
5534,"hello thede , do you follow the nfl at all ?"
5535,ye s. did you know they track players with tracking chips thqt are in their shoulder pads '?
5536,i think i have ehar dabout that before . the game is getting more high tech each year i will say .
5537,it's amazing that there aren't any w0men playing in the nfl even though they are allowed to joi .
5538,i think it would be really cool if a female player did make it and we got to see them on tv .
5539,maybe it' snot al lrhat cut out to be . engineers o naverage earn more than nfl playwrs .
5540,"i think i have heard rhat before , i think it is mainly due tot he car4ers not being as long as an egnineers ."
5541,yeah . career paths can change unexpecteldy for people . baee mayfieldc onsidered being a competitie gamer .
5542,"yeah bake5 was really good at halo 3 if i'm correct , did you ever play halo ?"
5543,"no i have not . also , alex smith ahd his bachelors degree before he was picked in the nfl draft . we are notc onfined to one trdade or raft ."
5544,"alexs mith ws sreally bright , i htink he could haveg one into any different field he wantedx ."
5545,"yeah , everything is possible . i hope though that new orleans saints cheerleadwers get better treatment ."
5546,tha rule wbout them being th erestaurant and having to leave is so outdated .
5547,it is amazing that nfl games usually have 11 minutes of actual live game play . that fact somehow alluded me .
5548,"that is just crazy , i don't think most people woulde ver guess it wzas that lirtel ."
5549,"decades ago , it may have been a better option to be a bowler thzn a football player ."
5550,"yeah i ould have loved to have been a pro bowler back then , on pa5 withw hat the footballs guys were making !"
5551,times were probably so different back then !
5552,oh yeah and it goes to hso wjust how much the nfl has grown since then .
5553,i hooe the changes to come will be chanves that promote more diversity and equal treatment . use of tracking chips are a good step towards increasing safety .
5554,"yeah i uope the same . i think th3 tracking chips will help with safety as well . well it's bsen nice talking with you , i hope you have a goo enight ."
5555,qre you a fan of the nfl ?
5556,"a little bit . i do enjoy watching some playoff games and the super bowl , but i don't follow any team closelyg . what about you ?"
5557,i fo9llow the redskins .
5558,i'm sorry for you then hehe ! who's the current qb of your team ?
5559,i don't know to be honest . we;ve won a few super bowls in my time . i cna't complain .
5560,"did you know that tom brady wa s abackiup qb in high school . his team lost all gmaes , but hi coach defused to put him on field ?"
5561,"yeah , i knew that . he doesn't get injuredm uch . i think thst is whyh he is wo good ."
5562,hes' won yet again this year . and it looks like he has no plan to retires oon . he will he known as theg reatest of all time whe3n all is said and done
5563,that is probably true . i wonder what he will do after football ?
5564,he doesn't have to do anything . he already hasx all the money in the world . mayb3 coahcing ? nfl season's are nly 1 weeks long . . .
5565,i'm not sure he'd be a good coach . maybe he will just be like el;way ?
5566,whay does leway do now ?
5567,i think he is hte owner of the broncos .
5568,that's a possibiliyty . i'm n0t sure that robet kr4aft will sell his team thoug h. there's only 32 teams in the league and they're worth quite a bit right now .
5569,robet kraft is in a bunch of trouble right now .
5570,"i don't think it matters too much . football ,m the american kind , is such a big business that he will be get a tiny slap on the wrist and ge tsent home"
5571,"yeah , that is true . i didn't know that espn won an emmy for that first down marker , pretty cool if you ask me ."
5572,i didn't either . i don't think i could watch a football game ever again without these . tehy help so much in following the action
5573,"that they are . i couldn't imagine a game eithout it . well ,n ice chatting !"
5574,same here . have a great day
5575,you too !
5576,heplo ?
5577,hi . do you watch football ?
5578,"i do , it is one of my favorites ."
5579,same here . did you know the first nfl plqyoff game was in 1932 ?
5580,"jo , serious ?"
5581,apparently it was played on an 0 yard fiel din chicago .
5582,"awesome , was it snowing '"
5583,"hopefully not , because t5hey played on a dirt field , so that would get really muddy ."
5584,who is your favorite quaterback ?
5585,i liked nick foles last year ! did you know rudsel wilson also has a cotnract as a profeswsional basenall player ?
5586,"no , i didn't kno that . i would do that instead ."
5587,"wlel , he hasn't played since 2011 , so he must be better at footblal ."
5588,did you know the huddle was made in order to hide hand signals ?
5589,really ? do you know whl made it ?
5590,t was paul hubbard .
5591,very cool . there is a high school stadium im texas that cost 60 million to make 1q i woul dbe interested to see what makes it so expensive .
5592,wholly molly ! are you serious ?
5593,"yeah . it's in alpen , texas and has 128 , 000 seats !"
5594,injteresting . everything is big in texas !
5595,very true ! like those big american flags that they use at6 football gmaes whicvh weigh 1100 pounds !
5596,"omg , are you serioys ? that can't be true"
5597,"and alparently they cost 50 ,0 00 ? ! who kne ! thanks for chatting . have a ice weekend !"
5598,hello there . are you an nfl fan ? i wanted to become an nfl plater once but it looks ike it's more financially smart to becom3 an engineer .
5599,i love the nfl . interesting that engineers make more tha footballs tars over the cours eof their lifetime .
5600,yes it is . o am still waiting for the first female football player . the nfl has no writte nrule against female players .
5601,i bet it will be a kicker position . what do you think ?
5602,yeah i agree i doh't think aother position would be suiting . there ares o many injuries even though live gameplay only lasts 11 minutee .
5603,hard to bleieve that stat . greenellis never fumbled 6ue football hise tnire nfl career .
5604,yeah that is very imlressive . i wonder if the nfl tracked him when he played by using a chip in the shoulder pad ?
5605,"i read they use the chips to track ball speed , rotation , velocity , an dlocaio n."
5606,yeahu i wonder whatt hey do with at information ? maybe they use it toh elp improve the quarterback position ? i bet kellen moore has some interesting football tracking stats becauseh e is the only lefthanded quarterback .
5607,i'm ot too suyre what they do with the information . i didn't realize that about kellan moore .
5608,yeah kind of interesting . another interesting fact is the circle huddle used ij today's footall was created by a deaf quarrerback so the other team could not read his hand signals .
5609,that is itnresting !
5610,yes it is . baker amyfield want to consider quitting football to pursue fulltime competifive gamjng . that would've been quite the career change .
5611,i hdard he liked halo 3 .
5612,ye tsounds like you could be anyone at the university of oklahoma in a one on one game . of halo three that is .
5613,d0 you like alrex smiht ?
5614,yeah he seems so smart . taking all those qp classedm ust have been challenging .
5615,i agree . ahrd to believe he wa a junior when he started college .
5616,yeah an becoming the first overall pick in 005 is also no easy feat . it was great talking with you today .
5617,i agree . who's your favorite qb ?
5618,my favorite qb is russel wilso n! he is a great guy . thanks again ftor the conversatuon and have a good day q
5619,"hey , tom brasdy is 41 . how about that ? are you ready to play in the nfl ."
5620,mot at this point . i think 'll stick to engineering . better career longevit6 .b ut good for tom ! he's in the sb again . getting a bit repetitive .
5621,wow . engineerin g. care to guess the highesf ever scoring football game ? it was in 1916 .
5622,"i would guess that some powerhouse schook ;layed a puny academic institution . i wohder what the spread on the game was , abd if the bookies took any be5s ."
5623,i don ot know what the betting was like . georgia tech beat cumberland 222 0. i would have been bored watching that .
5624,i wonder whether georgia texch put int heir second nad thir dstring . the person scheduling thatg ame must have been sacked . i'm surpridedc a cumberland player didn't get killed !
5625,"1916 was a long time ago . today , there are 32 t4ams in the ngl and a game has only 11 minutes of lige game play . thats a lot of commercial s, timeouts and flag waving ."
5626,"the gae really is slow . it's punctuated with a lot of violent acti8on , but it doesn't have the flow of basketbwll, ."
5627,yes . i agree . i knpw that the lige time earnings of an engineer is greater tha nthe lifetime earnings of a nfl player . i assum ethe violence make safor shorter earnihgs potential .
5628,"i figure the concussions alone preclude a career as an enginer after the nfl . i am surprised thatf here is only one lrfthanded qb in the nfl . i guess ik expected more , since each teamh as three qbs or so ."
5629,only one left handed qb . that is a fascinating bit of trivia .a nother fascinating bit of trivia is . . no rule against female players . think how wild the game would be .
5630,it hink female players could certainly handle noncontact positions such as kicker or punter . i don't know whether they could take the serious cotnact of the line of scrimmage .
5631,art and grace in running with a ball has a place . or something like that . tom brady is playing the first sunday in february . thr super bowl is on . who is the left handed qb ?
5632,"kellan moo4e is the only leftie out there . brad johnson had na interesting claim to fmae : he is a qb , but het hrew a td to himslef . ui d9dn't know that was legal , but i guess the passze rand receiver can be the same p,layer ."
5633,that is anj interesting thing . i guess as a kid we all threw the ball in the aif on a high ar co step forward adj catch it again . guess what cplor the u of iowa painted thes visitin gteak lodcker room ?
5634,either somethjng really sinister or something feminine .
5635,"kn it entirely painted pink . i wonder it it makes a difference . it is funny how manyd ifferent games are kind of not fo9otball but called foot ball around th eworld . soccer , rugby and more ."
5636,"i guesst hey could have painted it black , jut like the r0llings tone ssaid . might have put the opposition in a dire mood . football is such a generic term . could mean almost anythign ."
5637,"i am sure kids have fun with a ball no mater what . australian rules foot ball must be difterent than rugby . i have never seen gaelic footbakl , but i bey itx a tough game ."
5638,violence is hte key . i think the presence of the ball is incidnetal . just there as an excuse to pummel the other team . texas sweeks to be obsessed with high sfchool football .
5639,violenc3 or a high speed chess game ?
5640,do you like football ?
5641,"hi ! il ove football and the nfl , even though i hate yhe 17 week regular season that lasts from the beginnng of september all the way to late december . i wish it was longer . what about you ?"
5642,"i love it , 32 teams 2 diviasions and hten after a ong wait the superbowl"
5643,and it is a long wai t. ah ! it's bad enough the average game is only 11 minutes long in terms of live gameplay . then we have to wait a long time for the season to start again after the super bolwl ends .
5644,"all season only to watcu 11 minutes of live gamepla7 , seems really unfair , do you have a favorite mfl team ?"
5645,"i really like them all , honestly , although i don't like htat silly misogynistic rule the saints have in place that forbids cheerleaders from dining in the same restauranft as the football players . i can't believe no lawsuits ahve been filed over that rule yet !"
5646,"i know right , its a terrible rule wnd hsould be abolished so unfair and alsol s sexist"
5647,there have not been any female players drafted yet .
5648,yeah maybe hte interested ones didn't met the eligibility requirement but it would be great to wath a woman play slme day
5649,"indeed it would . but honestly , i fthey do it simply for the money , they should just enter the engineering field since egnineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of both mlb nad nfl players anyww ."
5650,looks likee ngieers have i tgreat they make more money and they don't risk the injuries football players do .
5651,so true . you know whats' sad is even the top bowlers made more than the top football plwayers back in the 1960s . and footblal is a mkuch tougher sport . i feel for the 0layers from that era .
5652,fhey did ? i guess football wasn't a popular game back then i dont' think bowlers make mhch money thrse days
5653,it's sad especially when you ahv eathletes like benjarvus greenellis who's never fujbled the football in his entirr pro car5eer ! they definitely deserve top pay !
5654,sad how many players still end up with financial problems or even bankrupt and then also with brain damage or a serious injury
5655,"i know , it is sad ! but you know , they're stkicking these trackin gchips in the players' shoulder pads now o record tehir every moves o hopefully they can use it to stuy how to prevent sefious injuries !"
5656,"i think tha'ts great , we must protect our players and make th egame safer thatm ust be like our 1 priority"
5657,"that is so true . well ince we're on the subject , are you a fan of qbs ? i like k4llan moore because he's the only left hnaded qb in the nfl , which is surprising ."
5658,its my favorjte position in football and i think his retired by now haven?t heard his name in a while
5659,yeah it's my favorite position as well because he touches the abll on neary every single offensive play and eh's the leader of the offense ! it's such a fascinating position !
5660,"i know right , calling tne play in the huddsle must be really exitin g, beingt h edecisive palyer on the team , but qnyways its beebn great chatting with you"
5661,"i bet it ist ough . that's why you need geniuses to play the posjtion like alex smitu who entered clllege as a junior . he even received his bachelor's in two years . that's fascinating ! well i twas geat chatting with you as well ! i hope you have a grat egvening , friend !"
5662,"he i8s a role model to many , proof that you can do both if you set your mind to it , hope you ave a grea tnight , thanks for all the cool facts and the conversation"
5663,hello
5664,good morning . i hope you're doing well this fine monday mornijg . do you like nfl foobtall ?
5665,i love it . you
5666,i do too . my favorite team is the new englanx patriots . how asbout you ?
5667,i like the steelers .
5668,"you a big be nfan , then . cool , i like pittsburgh ."
5669,did you know tha ttop bow;lers made more than nfl stars in tue 60s ?
5670,"that' shard to believe , isn't it . but fhen again the averagd lifetime earnings o fan engineer ism ore than the lifetime earnings of your average nfl player ."
5671,i should say the average nfl player has a pretty awesome jog thouh .
5672,"true , but htey do get banged up pretty hard sometim4s , too . so , i guess it's a tradeoff ."
5673,i guess . i think i would rather b ein the nfl myself though .
5674,"that's coop , what position would you play , quaerterback ?"
5675,or rb . i want the ball . hopefully i could go a whole career without fujmbling .l ike benjarvis green ellis .
5676,"yeah , that must have been tremendus pessure on him to never have fumbled the ball his whole career . i sure wouldn't have been able to do it . lol"
5677,me either . wonder how mahy years he played .
5678,"i'm not sure , but it's still a nimpressive feat ! xid you watch the last superbowl ?"
5679,yeha i watched most of it . i just wanted the patriots to lose to be honest .
5680,"oh , no . you pulled against my tea m?s hame on you ! lol . i tell you i was wore out frkm watching it , though . seemed like it last4d 3 hlurs ."
5681,i think t did . lol .
5682,"that'sd epresding and a lot of wasted time , considering thge average nfl gam ehas only 1 minutes of actual live game play !"
5683,im with you there they should speed the game up a little . have a good one .
5684,hi there . i wasn't aare that new orleans saint cheerleadere aren't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as nay nfl playr .
5685,the national football league and its teams have a lot of rules !
5686,many variations of football too .
5687,"true , and american football is much less populzr globally than soccer ."
5688,i actually like soccer better . maybe because ih ave played that as a femael .a lthough that can get brutal too i guess .
5689,thers is actulaly no rule wgainst female players in tge jfl .
5690,no . iow'as locker room for visiying ream sis pink lol
5691,"i doubt that color was chosen due to beneer ! maybe for teh better , since an average engineer earns more thna an average pro atheelte ."
5692,iw as surprised to see that top blowers in the 60's were paid more than football stars .
5693,"thinga certainlh have chagned . still , aquarterbacks have always made money ."
5694,maybe because thg are considered the ' leader ' of the offensive team ?
5695,"perajhps sko . when a deaf quarterback played , the team created the modern circular uuddle ."
5696,interesting . and espn created htat yello wline for t6he first down . added amenitiesf or football .
5697,the players are also interesting . alex smith was smart enough to enter college as a junior !
5698,qonder if he was going to be an engineer ?
5699,i think he was always planning on llaying ootball . baker mayfield on the other hand considered fulltime competitive gamign .
5700,"he's quite confident too , claiming to be able to beat anyojne oneonon ein halo 3 . at oklahoma that is ."
5701,"good thing he is not lefthanded , as kellan moore is the only lefty qb in 5uhe nfl ."
5702,it seems lke they are al3ays playing bt there qare only 16 games per season .
5703,"true , but that us over 1 7weeks . ad in four playoff rounds and four preseason , that 9s nearly half the year !"
5704,nicxe chatting with you . has been informative .
5705,nk peoblem . remember that even tom brady coild not get in a game while in jv football !
5706,"hi , how are you ?"
5707,good how are you ?
5708,"i am well , do you like th enfl wt all ?"
5709,yes i love it play off time
5710,apparently womne are technically allowed to play i nthe nfl !
5711,i did not knowt hat but it would be iteresting if she could taek a couplw hits
5712,"yea h, she might be okay , the average nfl game has 11m inutes of game rime !"
5713,wow i would think tht number would be way hihger .
5714,"yeah , but we need more commercials !"
5715,hell jo we dont lol . htey need to limitt hat or make the game longer so we see action not replays
5716,"i agree , there ares ome odd aspects . cheerleaders for the saints cant evn eat wyere the oplayers go to eat !"
5717,i guess it' tk prevent fraternizing .
5718,"i guess so , bt still , seems like an odd rule .a pparently engineers make more htan football players !"
5719,thats not fair all
5720,"i don't think so either , they are actually underpaid consideringw aht teams make !"
5721,yes that i show this life woesk
5722,"i suppose so , poor guys take a beatkng in all senses , like imagine cody parkey rihgt now"
5723,i know righ not fair at all
5724,"nope , but they don't make ther ules"
5725,"i hear that . the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink , what you think qbout that"
5726,that is hilarious . ijt must make them few silly i bet .
5727,"i know kill the spirit . did you know baker mayfield once xconsidered quittint fcootball to pursue fulltime competitive gaming , qnd claims to be able to beat anyone at the univerasity of oklahoma oneonone in hzlo 3 ."
5728,"that is razy , ib et theb rowns are glad he did not !"
5729,"i am a big fan of the natioanl football league , even if my favorite team , the redfskins , are ofcten one f the worst 9f the 32 teams"
5730,"i lov ehen fk ,m y team are the vikings !"
5731,it is curious how the games last several hours when th4re is only an average of 11 minutes of actual game play during tue event
5732,"for sure , if onky they could speed up the commericals , it would mak eit a better watch . did you know woman xcould play in the nfl"
5733,i do though none ever have ! i wanted to be a wide rece9iver when i was a kid but alas it was not to nbe .
5734,for zure me too lol ! are you an alex smith fan then ?
5735,i am he is definitely a smart guy working ohn his masters when h ewas drafted
5736,"for sure and getting a degree his sopho,ore year of college then becoming the 1 pick . he has done it all i guess"
5737,yes . he is good but not as good ast om brady he has won 4 super bowls !
5738,"i think tom brady has won 6 , he is really good !"
5739,yes but his high school coach did not think so he was never even allowed to play !
5740,"i know and he was draft in the 6th round of the draft , not too many people had high hopes for hte guy"
5741,yes but he is amazing . did you know that there is on.y one left handed wb in the nfl ? that surprises me
5742,i think it is kellen moore . vick is my favorite lefty of all time !
5743,yes there was even a deaf quarterbacmk once did yohu know that ? i guess the crowfs would be lessd istracting
5744,"i didn't know that , i wonder if he had anything to do with the huddles ?"
5745,yes they were invented to hide his hands igals from the other team
5746,"tha5 is smart , and look it still exists ! do you kbow benjarvus green ellis ?"
5747,does he play fort h epatriots ?
5748,yep and played for the bengals . he never fumbled once in his whole areer . that is amazing !
5749,tha tis crazy amazing ! hd must not have ever played for cumberlnad they once lost to gt 20 q
5750,i would have quit !g ood chatting with you !
5751,i don't thik the jets every lahded kirk cousins since he is in minnesota now . the jets had a horrible year .
5752,maybe laning kikr cousins would have helped them ?
5753,i think so . darnold is not the answer in ny in my opinion .
5754,some seem curious as to why tegh jets did not want to fork over the money for a sure thing since they yad the funds .
5755,agree . especially seeing hoaw much garoppolo got for only 7 jfl starts . seems the browns have made moe progress in getting a goo dqb in the draft .
5756,minnesota was predicted to be themost appealing destination for cousins .
5757,yeahh e went there and had an average year . they missed hte playoffs .
5758,cousikns implied that he wasn't necessarily going for the money but e was going for the best situation .
5759,i believe that . the jets are a bad situation . he probabvly could have gotten 150m guarnateed which is umheard of . htis according to mike florio from pro football talk .
5760,cbs sport's jason la canfora thought the jets and boncos would be finalists in getying cousins as eh thought new york would bemore appealing to the wuarterback .
5761,"yeah , i'm glad the redskiuns did not place the franchise tag on cousins again . that would have been bad for everyone involved ."
5762,i see . what is a franchise tag ?
5763,franchise tag is when the player get the average of teh tip w salaries at your position in the elague . guaranteed money but only for one year . players usually do not like it because it is not a long tewrm dewl and they could geth urt .
5764,"h , interesting . thanks for the explanation . i wonder why there is only one left handed quarterback in then fl ?'"
5765,thats interesting . neve rthought about that . kelen moore but not sure who he plays for .
5766,i do't know too much about footall so i appreciate your cmments . the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . maybe that's swhy i'm not too into it .
5767,kt is crazy o think of it like that for such a fast sport .
5768,i find it interesting how much thcnology thwre is in football these days .
5769,i know tracking chips in ehlmets and pads to record moves . probably to protexct them better in the future .
5770,"yeah , that's what i was thinkiny of . i also find it interesing that espn win an emmy for that superimposed yellow line ."
5771,i hopet hey just use that line gto measure first downs instead of those stupid chains !
5772,"yrs , i elieve it's a first down ;ine ."
5773,"hello . are you aware that the new orleans saints cheerleaders must leave a restaurant , if a player walks in ? even if they aren't done eating ? how archaic ist hat ?"
5774,"as sokmeone from louisiana and a saints fan , i am a bit surprised at having such a arcane rule . to me , if the cheerleaders were there firs , then thry should be allowed to finish the mela they paid for . but football dos have jtrs oddities , like the university of iowa ;ainting the visitors locker room pink !"
5775,"tyat' seasiewr to deal with , though i do wonder if the saints would give a femalre an opportunity to start if she met the eligibility requiremets ."
5776,"wlel , we just broke the glass ceiling on refsw ith a female ref ovficiating in an nfl playoff game . so maybe a female player jight not be too fat off if they meet the requiremnets . perhaps a punter or kicker , i . e . a lower physical impact position , first ."
5777,"maybe . living in brown's country , i'm so glzd baked mayfield didn't give p football to become a professionla gamer ."
5778,cleveland is a team my heart goes out too . fr th elongest time the saints did not have q super bowl . now its cleveland's turn to make it5 to the top .w hat do you think of tech in footblal ? it seems like tjey have tracking chips in shoulder ads and balls ?
5779,"i don'rt really know how i eel about that . i guess it's okay , if it keeps htem safe . i wonder if they would be willing to share the technology with car manufacturers ?"
5780,"maybe , but since a car moves more thna 100 yards , it will need to be at a different scale . i read somewhre that kellan more is the onky l4fthanded quarterbac kin the nfl . i know lefthanders have certain dvantages in baseball , e . g . first baseman , but do you think it is an advantage ax a quarterback ?"
5781,"i don't know , i don't follow football very closely . i know the games are too liong on t . v . , since there is only 11 minutes of live play ."
5782,i agree ; too many commercials and too much armchair quarterbacking fromt he broadcast booth . an innovation i liked was when espnc reatedt he yellow line overlay so thatt v vjiewers can comprehend how long a drive is neeced to get a first down . did you know that esp nwon an emmy for the superimposed 1st down ellow line ?
5783,"yes , that must have been a slow year . i find it impressive that alexs mith entered college as a junior , due to taking so many ap classes . wish my kids were that dedicated ."
5784,"he ah to be one of the fewt hat completed their education . so mamy enter the nfl draft beforeg raduating college . that , in part might explaib the lifetime earnings of a nengineer exceed th3 lifetime earings ocf an average nfl player ."
5785,"i don't know . i know a lot of them continue their seducation in the off seasln . i know bowlers int he 60's made more than football players , that's weird too"
5786,"that is a bit beyond comprehension . in my opinion , watch in bowling on tv is a bit like watchkng paint dry ! i recently found out that many years ago , the nfl had a daf quarterback . he created the circhular huddle so the opposing team could not steal his play signs !"
5787,that's fascinating . there is a former running back for the patriots who hs never fumbled . that's an amazing feat .
5788,i agree . have you been following the bronck's quarterback situation since the retirement of pe6ton manning ?
5789,"i have not . i barely pay attnetion to football , only when my son ha sit on . i only know about baker mayfield's competitiveness on halo 3 , because of him ."
5790,i don't follow itm uch either . but it seems tha tthe bronco have struggled putting together n offence . they picked case keenum who is a bhit of a unknown quantity ; it seems hje has been traded a lot of times .
5791,is elway the on ethey call the ' football czar ' ?
5792,"yes , and he's denvers gm . so , h etrying to get a good jix so they can get back to the super bowl ,. theq uestion is this a short term tdial run with keenum or a longer game plan ? its eems like keenum has a short contract so he might be a placeholder untiul elway finds the one he wants ."
5793,"thank you fo rchatting with me , ahve a lovely day ."
5794,you to . we hve our1 st mardi vgras parade tonight . hopefulluy the ran will hold off !
5795,"hey there who is your favorite quart3rback ? ik now tgat i like tom brady , even though he's nsver eaten a strawberry lol"
5796,"personally , i like eli manhing the best . i do find it odd that brady has never tried a strawberry lokl"
5797,"i kjow right ! i always wonder why he hash't tried on before lol . i like eli mannihg too . what do you think, abou talex smith ?"
5798,"he' seems very educated . i heard he took so many ap tests in high school that he ejntered univ3rsity as a junior . sm,art guy"
5799,"it sounds likr he's a smar guy yes . andh e passed his bachelor's degree in onlya bout 2 years , and was working on his master's before he got into the nfl , definitel,y ag enius"
5800,"i agree , its' good to be educayted . i wanted to be an nfl player but decided to stick to engineerin g. the average engineer makes more than most fl players"
5801,"that's int3resting . and yes i've heard that before ; i guess if you are an nfl player , you have to be smart with your mon4y so that you'd lasts over yourl iftime . what do you think about the circular huddel ? did you ever do that whne you were playing"
5802,"yes i did do that a few times . fun fact , it was actual,y created by a deaf auarterback !"
5803,"that is really cool , and i'm sure tgat e used it so that other people couldn't see his hand signs . i wonder ho wgood he was at football , i don't think we've had a deaf quaerterback in the nfl , do you know ?"
5804,"i'm actually not sure . but i do know that kellan moore the only left handed quarterback in the nfl . seems odd , you'd think lefties would be ore common"
5805,"you would think so yes . i wonder if it gives him an wdvantage or not , do you know ? i also think it's inreresting that one plauer almost became a professional video game player , imagine that is such a difference lol"
5806,that is quite the difference lol ! i think you're talking about baker mayfield . . apparently he can beat anyoen at halo 3
5807,yep that's who i was referribg to . i used to play halo 3 back in the day . dikd you ever play any of the halo games ? i ish ic ould havbe played him lol
5808,i did play halo bt i wasn't very good at it . he could definitely beat me oneonone ! lol
5809,haha yes i bet he could beat us both actually . do you watch bowling at all ? apparentl;y top bowlers in the 60s made more than top football players back in that day
5810,"wow ! makes sense becase bowling was a lot more popular back then . also technology has come so fa r ,hte nfl uses trackin gchips now to record a player's every move"
5811,"wow that;s interesting . how did those work by the way ? i wonder if anyone ever put tracking chips in bowling balls lol ,"
5812,"they embed htem in the shoulder pads and it basicallt tracks velocity , ball speed , location , etc . it'z pretty cool . tracking chips i nbowling balls would be interesting lol"
5813,"lol i agree with you . you ever watch footbnall on tv by the way ? did you know that espn won an emmy ? it was for developing thqt yellow line that you see o ntv , you know the one that designates the first down"
5814,"i did hear that ,t hat's pretty neat that taht they could superimpose something like that"
5815,"yes i ebt that was very advanced tecnology back in the day haha . i also like that the patriots have a player that has never fumbled the ball before . that is an insane record to me , i would han that guy the ball all the time"
5816,so i lovr the fact that women can nbe possibly eligible for the nfl
5817,yes . . . very much .
5818,what do you think about them chipping the players moves ?
5819,"discover the nien bes chipping ykp , that will make you chipping motion dead soli ."
5820,"i don't know what that meas , however it is a good thing statiscally"
5821,yes . . . this good fdor us .
5822,"i love he fact about tom brady not bekng used as a back up qb and how he turned out . . id on't know myuhc ab9ut fgootball , so that is a great fun fact , whst is your favorite thing about football ?"
5823,"i'll be hojest , my favorite thign about football is a nasty , soul jarring , hit . . . . i love that i nfootball you can alwagys point at a coupl teams"
5824,"oh fun , that is much more exciting than the dances they do in the endzone !"
5825,very much esciting
5826,"im g;ad i dont watch i though . . with that statistic of only 11 min of live play , whata re people watching then ?"
5827,"on average , american adults are watching five hours and four minutes of televisin per day . the bulk of that is about four and a half hours of it is live television , which is television watched when originally broadcast ."
5828,do you watch the super bowl for th egam eor the commercials ?
5829,yes .
5830,lol . . 8 don't even know who is good . who do you think is going to the superbowl ?
5831,"super bowl liii , the 53rd super bowl and the 49th modernera national football league , nfl , championship game , will decide the leaguec hampion for the 2018 nfl season . the game is scheduled to be played on february 3 , 2019 , at mercedesbenz stadiu min atlanta , georgia ."
5832,ok . . that didn't answer my question . dlo ypu like otger types of foobtall ? i thihnk rugby is super fun to watch !
5833,no . socer

5835,neymar
5836,thank you
5837,"hi , how are yoj or"
5838,well thanks . what do you think of pat mahomes ?
5839,i tyink he's great ! he just won the mvpa nd if's only his first year staeting and second overall . he'xs go ta brihgt future . . .
5840,"thed ypungest player to throw 6 tds in a ga,e . thats pretty good"
5841,yeah . he is a really good athlete . his team asked him to stop playing basketball because he was too good and may hurt himelf . . .
5842,thzts really understandable but he's young guy . whqt do you expect him to do ?
5843,"especilaly when a lot of young guys end up in bars and clubs drunk nad then in bad situations . i think he's a good dude , by all accounts ."
5844,i heard last year he didnt do any end9rsements to stay out of the spotlight because he was still the backup
5845,"i think a lt or young guys do that coming into the league . andrew luck did that too . i twae intsresting to aee him , the umber 1 pick , and the 2nd pick and ho wthey wen tabout their careers ."
5846,it helps thst the chiefs have very talented players on offense . its really hard to cover all of them
5847,yeah . their weapons are really talented . they had to cut theirr unnign back due to assalting a woman . not ok !
5848,im gla dthe chiefs did something . most teams would've tried to sweep it under the rug
5849,"one the video g4ts out t5here , they have to respodn . trhe ravens and nfl failed on the ray rice domesfic violence issue so now esveryone has to respond by cutting teh player when the video get sout ."
5850,the nfl doesnt have a rule against female players . how hardd o you think it would b efor them
5851,"i do not think the american public has the stomach to see a small female com;eew ith huge dudes l althoug hthere might not be a rule , it wo9uld not ve a good look ."
5852,yeah as talented as you may be . it would bd really hard when the other person can weigh 3x asm uch as you
5853,the physicality of the game is crazy . the average person wouldn't be able to compete .
5854,iyt would look like when georgia tech eat cumberland 2220 . which is the highest score evefr . no one beeds to see that
5855,ha ! yes . like that !g ood reference ansd transition ! espn won an emmy for that yellow libne ?
5856,it is crazy to think how much that line ha schanged football viewing .
5857,nice chatting 3ith yu !
5858,"hi , how are you today ?"
5859,"i mgreat ,k do you like foorball ? do you follow the nfl '"
5860,sometimes . tere is no rule against women playinb . i wonder if women will ever appear in the league .
5861,"i dont think so ,t hough i think it's interesting that theres' no writte4n rule"
5862,"women would be good at egnineering . they could make more money , and not have to deal with so many concussions . the bran is the center of intelligence , even in nfl players ."
5863,"i agree brai ndamage is a real dange for players , it can really play a number on them and i guess a nengineer does make more money in hix life time and with less risks"
5864,pluse ngineers are important to the game . the nfl ses frackig chips embedded in plkayers shoulder pads to record a players every move on the feld .
5865,"and theres also chips okn hte footballs , they are used to track velocity of the ball , the rotation , spin and also the locatio"
5866,"better for womne to be engineers than nfl cheerleaders , that'e for sure ."
5867,"i aree , theres an unfair rule against cheerleaders ."
5868,"yes , that's true . do you fkllow the coll4ege game ? the highest score in a football game took place in 1916 when the mighty georgia tech defeated lowly cumberland 2220 ."
5869,"one thing is for sure thney couldnt perfomr worset ahn a team that is losin gby 222 pokints , thats an epic los , humil9ating for sure"
5870,i would love tl know feh spread on that game . in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . i guess that pro football leagues were not well developed then .
5871,"yeah it seems tnhat way since football players earn a ton of money noe , do you have a favorite team ?"
5872,"no , don't really have a favorit e. some teams i dislike though . the university of iowas' locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink . i guesst hey think they'r egoing to psych out the other team . ahve they won more games at home because of that locoer room ? do other temas do hte same thing ?"
5873,"i dont think so , its tue first time i hear about z footbal lteam having pink locker room s, footballs eems like a scam though , only 11 minutes of live gameplay per match"
5874,"yeah , especially since the tix are so expesnive !"
5875,yea hdo you follow the espn channel .
5876,"no l don?tr eally follow espn . anyway , nice chatting with you ! ttyl ."
5877,"i see well when you watch the channelr emnember this cool fact , they created the first down line , and won an emmg because of it"
5878,thanks !
5879,hi how are you doing there tday ? are you good ?
5880,"i', good , a little peeved at jameis winston saying has to teadh his son to respect women when eh was suspenfed for gropiny a woman"
5881,why do guys do this ? do they think that they are going to get away with it ? now ? ! not likely .
5882,"i don't know , winston was also avcused of rae in 0212 when he was still in college"
5883,some people can control themselves and need to be supervised or punished .
5884,it's ridiculous tha5 he's engagea nd still acted so orribly
5885,nfl has had a lot of prlblems with player behavior . i thoink teh league needs to takde a stronger stand .
5886,"the teams 6oo , ghe buccaneers still stoo byw inston ddspite his character history"
5887,"yes , there should be a team level punishmnet to dive the point hoem . behave . you are a public fkgure ."
5888,"yea , the only thing teh bhcs did was start ryan fitzpatrick , bht at the end of the zeason winston was the starter aain"
5889,the money is the thinmg . yo get them to pay cash and they will start to pay attention .
5890,"i guess so . it's funny is heerleaders are held to a more strict standard than the player s, they are forced to leave if a nf lplayer comes into a restaurant theh are in"
5891,gthat is sexism and misogyny . what is that rule stil laround ?
5892,"i have no idea . i wonder what the discipline would look like if there were female players , there are no rules abrring them"
5893,i think that women could play6 . reaoly i twould be better to start the sport at th ehigh school level .
5894,only if you have good coaches . tom rbady's jv coach never started him despite the team not winning a game
5895,the man was an idiot not to see that talent . tb was a talnt in waiting . just needed his opportunity .
5896,"so was cdumberland'es coach in 1916 , they lost to georgia tec 2220"
5897,"why would any coah do htat to a team ? it seems cruel . anyway , great chat !"
5898,"i don't know , i wondeer why kellan moore was the only leftfh anded qb i nthe nfl"
5899,i don't know either . maybe coaches don't like lefties ? have a good day !
5900,you foo
5901,hi ! my favorite part of the superbowl are the commercials . how about you ?
5902,"yes i agree with you on that ! games are do boring , especially sincd they only averaged about 11 minutrs of actual gameplay"
5903,u can't believe tat ! tehcnllogy . . . it changes the world . consider the tracking chips in their shoulder pads . . . guess big brother is always watching !
5904,"yeah that would scare me . i hope that they take those tracking chips off when they leavet he fi3ld , would you ever wear those outside of sports ?"
5905,"not if ic ould hekp it . i mean with my luck , i'd be tracked worse tha na saints cheerleader avoiding a player in a restaurant ."
5906,"yeah i don't like how theyc an't go to a restaurant if a player is ijnside . or i the player enters them they have fto leave , that seems really ufnair"
5907,it really is . funny how the world changes . ic an't wait for our first female nfl player !
5908,"yes there's no 5ule against it ! i could see you thereb eing a kicker soon , what do you think the first position would be ?"
5909,quarterback ? maybe hat's me dreaming big . thenb again . . . they had a deaf quarterback ocne . things happen !
5910,"i think thatd eath quarterback actually invented th ecircular huddle , which we stil use today which is awesome !"
5911,it is ! i can't believe kellan moore is the only left ahnded quarerback you'd think we had more !
5912,yes an di wonder if it gives him an advantge as well ? you would think that alex smith would have a hug advant6age as a quarterback to because he wad so smart back in ckllege
5913,"and on the opposite end of the spectrum , we have bakerm ayfiled . from quarterback to professional gamer . . . sign me up !"
5914,"yes absolutely ! he definitely made the rihgt choixe going into the nfl , do you know how espn won an emmyt houfh ?"
5915,no ! that's awesome . i like the fact bowpers once made twice as much a nfl players . can it go back to that ? i like bowling .
5916,"yes i like bowling two , i bhave a better chance of being a professional bowler than being an nfl star hsha ."
5917,same ! i wouldn't be rb bnejarvus greenellis who's neve4 fumbled the footbal lin his career .
5918,o want him on my team ! but i also lov the patriots so am with tom brady would probably be so unfair haha
5919,they need to score like georgia tech vs cumbetlanr 222 to 0 !
5920,"that game wqas such a blow oug ! i wis that we ha dvideo cameras to record it back then , or at least espn could have put the yellow line for the gfirst foiwn marker wehn they were recording that game , maybe it would have helped cumberland to win haan"
5921,"maybe an allpink locker room , just like the university of iowa has ! , would have been their good luck charm ?"
5922,yeah that's possible ! do you thjnk that they won more games or lost more games after that happsned ? i would have played a lot better if i were in a pink locker room persoanlly lol
5923,good afternoon . i thibk alex smith is a great fit for the redskins . what are your thoughts ?
5924,hi how are you ? i dont knoa much about smith or the redskins . why do you think that ?
5925,"well i think they need to stay ahead in games . smith isn't the kind ofq uarterback who excels in a shoot outs , it goes against the style of 0play ."
5926,what is a shoot out in football ? lots of passing ?
5927,yes exactly . like when the redskins play the saints they were down by three scores and people sometimes refer to a comeback like that a shootout .
5928,"ok . so he is not big at comebacxks .h e is quite a bright guy , right ? finished college in like 10 minutes or something ?"
5929,ha ha yeah basically that fast . he received his abchelors degree in two years .
5930,that is quite fast . he must be a good student . is he still playingh in the nfl ?
5931,yes that is very fast . it usually takes four years . ji believe you stull playing . he did al ot of ap classes in high sch0ol so 5ht's how he finished college so fast .
5932,he is still playing . ok . i heard that hd susfained an injury . that is a lot of ap tests !
5933,i believe he is set to play next season but i'm not sure . he is righthanded but kellen moore is the only left handed quarterback in teh nfl .
5934,why is there onlh on e? that seejs osd . do coaches not like lefties ?
5935,i'm not sure maybe the plays aren't designed for them ? anther samart quzrterback is bake mayfield . but he almlost became a fulltime competitive gamer .
5936,i guess that could be a goo dway to make money . i dont how many pros th3re are ib gaming .
5937,"i think there's good money buyt probbaly not as good as football . it seems like his game was halo 3 ,"
5938,i have never played ualo . i guess it must be pretty challenging . he probably did the right tingg oing into footabll .
5939,yes it is a lot of fun to plah i recommended . i agree though football is the better choice . the high score ever in a football game was 222 to 0 !
5940,i wonder what the winning oach was thinking . that kind of score seems cruel .
5941,yeah i don't know what georgia tech was thinking that is not a good gesture . poor cumebrland . well it was nice hcatting with you thanks again .
5942,"yes , i enjoyed chatting !"
5943,have a good one !
5944,do you like football ?
5945,"good evening , yes i do . how about you ?"
5946,i;m a big fan ! do you have a favorite tea m? i'm an eagl;es fna myself .
5947,"yes , don't hate me , but my favoritet eam is the patriots !"
5948,that's ok . i like the mtoo . in fact i'm a big brady fan . my one frandmother came from the boston area ther3e and i still have cousins there . s i root for them .
5949,"cool , i didn't realize how many peoplw actually loathe tge new england patriots and the goat tom brady ."
5950,i actuwally watched his tom vs time documentary and il ove the work ethic he puts into the game . did you know that former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the football in his nfl career ?
5951,"yeah , i had heard that stat and i couldn't begin to imagine th3 pressure h efelt to remain perfect 5hroughout his cwreer . wo w!"
5952,i know right ? lol i read that espn qon an emmy award for creatin gthe superimposed yellow first down line . mneverk en2t hey had an emmy award fo something like that .
5953,"me either ,g ood for them , though . iy'd such a part of watching the game , it deserved that award !"
5954,i agree . i go back and watch old gqmes on youtube from ike the 70s and 80s when i was a kid and it's just crazy how the graphics have changed since then .
5955,"big difference between thn and now , fpr sure . did you watch the last superbowl ?"
5956,i did and i was rooting for the patriots . i ws roofting for them too last year when they lost .
5957,glad to hear that . lol i swear that gwme seemed it lasted thre ehours !
5958,lol it did . eve4n towards the end . i liked watching belechik on the sidelines towards the en dhwen they were figuring out what was goig o nwith tsh gamevlock . he looked liek he was giving the sidleine judge an eqrfull . lol did you know that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay ?
5959,"oh man , i knew there was alot of waste dtime , bt eidn't think it was all that much , htough . kind of makes me mad , now . lol"
5960,short isn'y i5 ?
5961,"so true ! wonde rwhy a woman hasn't played in the nfl , yet ?"
5962,good queston . d you know who kella nmoore is ? i'm not familiarw ith him but is ee where it says he is hte only left handed qb in the nl .
5963,"yeah , that must be an advntage of some kind ?"
5964,"i'm not sure if it would or wo7ldn't be . lo, it's been fun chattin wit you ! have a good night and go pats !"
5965,hello do you like football ?
5966,it doens't really catch my attention . maybw because there qre only 11 minuts of live gameplay per game .
5967,yeah thats disappokinting lol
5968,i also have trouble following the game . the yellow line ahs helped a bit . espn won an emmy dor creating thaf .
5969,yes i thinkt hat is really helpful ! i hear the nfl uses tracking chips on the players and inside tye football
5970,"wow , it's maazing how much technoloyy for football has changed over tge years . a while back people didn't seem to care that much about football . in the 60s , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
5971,tha tmust have been a good time to be a bowlwr !
5972,right ? and i don't think any college football teams these day swould lose as bad aws cumberland did . they lost 222 to 0 to georgia tech back in 1916 .
5973,wow thats embarrassing .
5974,"yeah , haah . speaking of embarrassing , tom brady's high school coach never started him even 6hough the team was having a historically bad season . they hadn ot won a game or sored a touchdown that ssason ."
5975,"oh right i read that lol wow did they miss that opportunity , they probably couldve wont heir season lol"
5976,"yeah , i would feelb ad if i were his coach since now he has won the super bowl several times ."
5977,yeah probably kicking hjmself while watchign him play every sunday lol
5978,"ha , true ! whatd o you think about the 12 . 5 million judgement where the rams have to pay reggie bush 12 . 5 million dollrs ? do you think the rams are kicking themsleves too ?"
5979,lol ye s.
5980,"reggie bush slipped and fell on the at edwards jones doem . he also included the stadium in his lawsuit , htough they were xismissed as the judge said the rams had control of the facility on game days ."
5981,"yeah i read . thats kinda like companies getting sued becauses omeone injured themselges on their property though , i guess its whatever ."
5982,the rams lawyer said that reggie bush is one of the most talented running backs and should have avoided the concrete .
5983,yeha i guess he wasnt paying attention
5984,on the other hand reggie argued tha tthe injury cost him 10 to 15 million in future nf; earnings .
5985,well didnt he win the 12 mil ? wouldnt that soemwhat compenzsate for his ' injuries ' lol its been greatc hatting .
5986,hey do you know anything about football ?
5987,"no , not a thing . i think it is neat the way fo0otball means american football , soccer or rugby , depending on where you are ."
5988,"yq i don't watch , but i do know that i like the patriots and the6 have a rb who has never dropped the ball"
5989,"a runnoint bac,k thar has never dr0pped the ball ? so , this implies american fnl footbalk . it is a dull game to watch , wigh only 11 minutes of live gam eplay per game ."
5990,"yup i agree , also weird there are no rules against female players , would you wwtch that ?"
5991,"i think like the gorgeous ladies of wrestling , it has been doe . bu i would watchb some of tjat . not sure a 17 wee ksrason would be fun ."
5992,"ya we would have to see , did you know envineers make more h5an nfl players over their lifetime ?"
5993,"i believe the word average is very important there . some players never make it big , while most engineers pull money . iw onder why cheerleaders can not be in the same restaurant as a new orleans saint ?"
5994,"ta i don'tl ike that , they shouldn't have to leave , that jjst sounds ou7tdated , what bout you ?"
5995,an out dat4ed and wrong thing . i be some engineers use chips in players pads tot rack and record players move4ment . htose engineers get paid more than the playe r.
5996,"those tracking chips scare kme , i wouldn't want someone go know my every move , hopefully they just keep those o nthef ield"
5997,"o nthe field and the one in the ball . to bad the balls from tom brandies deflate gate were not monitored for aitr pressure . the ball measures velocity , rotation and locatiohn ."
5998,do you have a favorite quarterback ? andd id you know kellan moore was left handed
5999,i have no favorite . i would think left handed wuld be an zdvantage . most palyers would expext the ball to be in a cetain location . kellan would be a little off that . the offensive team leader that touches the ball the most .
6000,"yup i think it gives na advantage being left handed , did you hear about the deaf quarterback who invented the circular huddle"
6001,such a importan tinnovation . now everyoned oes it . or maybe stwfdi8m is so loud no one can hear . there was a qb who wanted to be a pro gambler . 9oklahoma plzayer i think .
6002,"good thing he chose football , baker mayfield was going to be a professional gmaer and play halo 3"
6003,there are many thints bout the game that seem like video games . take the line for the first down . we expect it . espn won an emmy for its creaion .
6004,"that eas a great creation for sure , very useful , also i never knew alex smith was a genius he got his degree in only 2 years"
6005,good for alex . i wonder if he picked a useful major like engineering . in the 1960's pro bowlers madwe as much as top football stars . i wonder if engineers make more than bowers ?
6006,they do actually ! a lot more over hte course of their lifetimes which is crazy !
6007,hey how often do you watch the nfl ? i know i watch football from time to time on tv
6008,i watch one in a while . i find the games boring sometimes . they only play an avrage of 11 minutes per game !
6009,yep you're right abvout that ! that probably explains why the super bowl was a little bit borign this year haha . do you think that women should play in the nfl by the way ?
6010,"i know tere's no rule saying they can't , so i guess if they can meet the requirements , they should probably be allowedc ."
6011,"yeah i can set hat . i think we could see a femael player in our lifetime , it's the only fair thing , as long as they're good enouhg to play theys hould be allowed to play i think"
6012,"yeah , they migth as well get a fair shot . some of the rules of the nfl are still sexist . like how some cheerleaders can't eat at a restaurant where players are eating"
6013,"yeah i don't like that rule . i think it's really stupid and not appropriate in this day and age . i just don't get how that one ad been sued yet about it lol , have you heard about the trackign chips that they use tio"
6014,"yeah , that's pretty cool . some things like that are so high tech . liek the yellow first down line that espn won an ejmy for !"
6015,"that's really genius by the way . i'm glad they won an ejmy for that , it's definitely necessary for enjoying games o nthst v i think . but yes the tracking chips can track players movemnets and speed , i think that's pretty useful"
6016,i agree ! they are in the footballs and snoulder pads ! do you know what the score of the highest scoribg football game ever was ?
6017,i don't . what was it ? i do know thazt back in the sixties the top bowlers made more than the top football layers of 6he time . nw that ist otally reversed today . haha !
6018,that's amazing ! the hihgest score was 2220 ! but it was a college game ;
6019,wow that's crazy ! what year ei dhappen ? i would have loved to see that game haha . do you think that the losinf team had their locker rook lainted pink perhaps lol . i guess the un9versity of iowa's football team di that to the opposing players
6020,"i twas way back in 1916 . that's pretty funny , actually . i wonder what the visiting teams thought of that ."
6021,"yeah i wonder that too ,w hat do you think abou tth epatriots by the way ? did you know that htey have a player who's never fubmeld the ball ? his name iw benjarvus greenlelis"
6022,"i am kin dof sick of them being in the super bowl every year , it's boring ! he must feel al ot of pressure never to get his first fumble !"
6023,"yeah i agree . i would feel so stressed every time i p;ayed haha . what do you think about alex smith by th eway ? man is so smart , he got his bachelor's degree in only 2 years and then went to play for the nfl"
6024,"that's pretty cool .h e was the first pick in the 2005 draft , too !"
6025,"oh that's cool ! i really like th estory behind the circular huddle , i twas created by a deaf quargerback in order to block the other team from seeing his ahnd signs , that's reall cool"
6026,"that's brilliajnt , actually ! there is only one let haded quarterback in the nfl ."
6027,"i thihm htat's kellen moore right ? also there's onjly one quarterback who is almost going to be a professional video game player . and that was baker mayfield , i think he made the righ tdecision haha .;"
6028,good morning .
6029,god morning ! do you like football ?
6030,"yres , i love football . do you ?"
6031,"i've never really wathced it . although it seems hte qb here is pretty smart . alex smith took so many ap tests kin high school that he entered university as a junior . the quarterback received his bachelor's degree in two years , and began working on a master's degree , befor ebecoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft ."
6032,"wow , that's cool . ghe university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink"
6033,"trauma ! the circular huddle used in todays american footblal was created by paul d . hbnard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not read his hand siganls ."
6034,in tbe 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars
6035,isn't htat crazy ? kella moore is 5he only left handed quarterback in the nfl
6036,that is hard to believe . wow .
6037,i know ! the highest core ever in a football game occurred in 1916 whe georgia techd efeated cumberland 2220
6038,that;s crazy .a n average nfl game only has 11 m9nute sof liv egameplay
6039,i know ! and it last about 2 . 5 hours ! former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fubmled the football in his nfl career .
6040,"new orleans saints cheerleaders ard forbidden from eating in t5he same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave ."
6041,isn't that crazy ? espn won an emmyf or yhe creation of the superimposed yeloow line representuing the first down line fpr american fooitballg azmes .
6042,"nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder ;ads to record a players every move on teh field . they are lso located inside footbawlls to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and locatipn ."

6054,hello do you like football ?
6055,i do ! i'm a big fan !
6056,"o hgood , yeah football is very entertaining ."
6057,yez it is ! the university of iowa painted their visitrs lpcker roo mpink . w9nder why they did that ?
6058,"i think its a mental tactic , like to amke them feel calm or sometghing"
6059,that would mkaes ense . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of that era . i'm sure that's not like that any longer .
6060,"yeah i doubt it also , bowling isnt what i used to be . fotball players get paid a ton lol"
6061,lol the highest scoring football game ever wasw hen georgia tech beatc umberland 2220 in 1916 . talk anout a blowout !
6062,"ouch , thats embarassing ! thats a huge loss !"
6063,no doubt ! espn won an emmy for creating the yellow superimposed first down lien you see on tv while watching game s. i didn't even know they gave out emmy's for something like tht .
6064,honestly me eith4r lol but good for them that diital lien has been really helpful on scdeens and tvs .
6065,yes ! lol former patriots b benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball in his nfl career . impressive !
6066,"thats crazy , how does someone not fumble for their whole caeer , thsts grezt . theee is also only one levt hnaded quarte rback in the nfl weird huh"
6067,i'm not sure . lolt hat is amazing thsat there is only 1 left handed qb .
6068,the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterbafk
6069,whatw as his name ? i can't remember it .
6070,paul d hubbard
6071,nice ! the nfl haes no written rule against female players . wonder if we will see o4n ever ?
6072,"maybe ,b ut there's too much injury in football"
6073,true .t he average nfl game only has1 1 minuges of live gameplay . rekatively short compared to how long they stretch the games out . it's been fun chatting !
6074,"great chatting ,h ave a good on e."
6075,"hello there , are you a fan of the nfl ?"
6076,"i am actually , irts wild that an nlf game only has about 11m isn of gameplay on average"
6077,"isn't htat crazy , i think you notice all the stop;s and stuff more when you attend a live game ."
6078,"ya i haven't been to a live gam ein years , what do you think of the way the saints heerleaders have to act 3hen outside ogf the field ?"
6079,i think that rule izs a bit outdated . i think they should have standard rulesx within normal laws that everyone else follows .
6080,"ya i agree , i'ts o dumb they have to leave a restaurant if a palyer walks i nfor instance"
6081,exactly . did you read that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than thea verage nf lplayer s?
6082,"that is craay , but nfl players aldo don't play their whole lives they retire early , so who knows"
6083,"i think that is what it is , is that the engibeer's ca5reer is far longer than the average nfl career ."
6084,"yup exatly , also crazy is the nfl could on eday have female players"
6085,i think that would be so cool if a femae player did make a pro rkster . i think it would huge for young sports fans .
6086,"ya , i think a female coudl become a kicjer orm aybe a quarterback ,w e shall definitely see"
6087,that would be cook to see a female quarterback one day .
6088,haha ya maybe she'd paint her lockerr oom pink like the iowa team did for opposing players haha
6089,"that is so funny , iw onder wgho was in charge over there that gave the final ok for it , or if they just did it as a prank and then officials left it that way ."
6090,"haha ya i do wonder that , 9 also wonder how a team can lose n football 2220 !"
6091,that is just insane . i wnde4r if they just scored a touchdown on every single play ?
6092,"ya i don't know , but it wou8ld suck to be a cumberland fan on that day and get desttoyed like that haah"
6093,yeah i wonder how many fans were actually still there when the 1222 point was scored ?
6094,"oh ya , if i wer ea georgia tec hfan even i would have left when it reached 100 to 0 haha"
6095,"right lol . well it was nice talking with you today , i hope you have a good day ."
6096,are you a fan of ther avens ?
6097,"not a huge ravesn fan , you ? i like football though and luckily there are 32 teams so plenty of variation ."
6098,did you know that kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in tbhe nfl ?
6099,"that is surprising i don't even know of hm . ut i do know baker mayfield , and he sounds like he was a big gamerf ."
6100,"interesting , is this the guy that was going to ne a video game pro ?"
6101,yeah he apparnetly loved to play halo 3 !
6102,"intetesting , is tha tfor ps4 or xbox ? i have neithe rbut was interested ikn getting one of them ."
6103,xbox i believe . he claims h could have beaten anyon eat the university of ok.ahoma .
6104,"interesting , did he get paid for doimgt his ?"
6105,i don' tbelieve he did . another amart quarterback was alex smith ! he fook a lot of ap classes .
6106,i think he as working on his masters egree before being drafted .
6107,very impressive . he was the first overqall pick in the 2005 dxraft !
6108,"yeah m, fhat seems pretty cool . the average nfl game on7 has 11 minute sof gameplay ."
6109,so many ads for all that ? also girls are legally allowed to play !
6110,they are . and they a.lso put chips in the players shoulderpawds .
6111,no wonder they get such waccurate stats abd info about players movemnents on the field .
6112,"yeah , aplarently there are chips in the balls a swell . pretty crazy if you ask me ."
6113,"oh wow . and they can trac veloxity , rotation , ball speed , and location . cool ."
6114,"yeah , it is prfetty cool . although 'm not entirely sure what you would do with all that information . well , it was nice chatting with you !"
6115,yeah i ould like to know that too . knowing tyhe nfl they use it to make more money ! you as well there prtenr .
6116,"exactly , probably some type of advertising gimmic . take i5 easy !"
6117,"hi there , do you watch the fnl much ?"
6118,"hey ! i love the nfl , but sadly don't get to follow it much , how about you ?"
6119,"yeah same here , bit i do watch some of the games . do you know who baker mayfield is ?"
6120,isn't he the quarterback who almost quit footbqll to have a career in competitive gaming ?
6121,yup that is him . and he still satys that uhe can beat anyone at u of oklahoma i halo 3
6122,"wow , i have heard about that , lol . . . pretty cool ! but being a quarterback has probably been the better choice fo rhim . do you know wjho kellan moore is ?"
6123,"yeah , isn't he the guy who is the only qb in the nfl that is lefthanded ?"
6124,"yep , pretty rare ! kinda rare like pat4iots r . b benjarvus green ellis who never fumbled a fkootball ever in his entitre nfl career !"
6125,what a talent . do you like brady too ? heardh e was a backup qb in hig hschool and they never started him .
6126,i am a huge tom brady fan . that is crzzy ! big mistae om their part by not lettign him play . he is an amazing qb .
6127,"exactly , he has come a longw ay for sure . how about alex wmith ? he is talented and super smart it seems"
6128,"exactly , he is very smar5 . kinda like the huddle thatw as created by that deaf quarterback !"
6129,"yeah that is so cool , what a way 5o communicate with your team while others have no clue what yo7 are saying ."
6130,"rigth ! geniua . football has come so fa r, it is crazy how pro bowlers used to make more money than top football stars . crazy !"
6131,"i k now , things have changed sl much now for sure .? did you know women can play in the nfl ?"
6132,i have heard that because the nfl allows them to play if they meet their requirements which i can't imagine a femsle wanting to go up agsinst such huge men lol . . . coudl happne though . i think it's awful that the cheerleadeds are not allowedt o eat in the same place qas the new orleans saints . . . .
6133,taht rule is so wrong and the worst part about it is the fact that they have to leave midmeal if the players walk in
6134,"i kn9w ! not right , makes ypu wonder why . . . that surely can't be how it is in today's times , but you never know what rules are hidden within the nfl . . ."
6135,"yeah i am not sure either , i just hop eit goes away sooj . on a happier ote , they are puttig tracking chips on the players now to record a variety of things"
6136,"i have heard that hte nfl is doign that , to track the players moves qnd the football velocity adnr otation . . . very clever !"
6137,"yeah , hope they can use that to reduc econcussions and such too . nice chatting with you ."
6138,"do you think that tie games in the nfl are good , bad or are you indifferent ?"
6139,indifferent . a lot of people think it is fine .
6140,i really don't like sudden death types of dealing with it .t here should be a dlear winner .
6141,why do you think so ? some people think that a tie shoudl not be seen as less satisfying .
6142,i ws referring to a sudden death victory . i wasn't clear there should be more time on the clock . a tie is ok with me .
6143,"i am not a nexper t. hkwever , i admire some nfl teams ."
6144,i prefer college wheb it comes to american football . the excitementg in things like ' going for it ' s the same .
6145,i prefer college footballs bettee no noney is involved in it . do you know thwt nfl has no rule against female plsyers ?
6146,agree . i did . i wonde if the ncaa does . it's probably more of a universitybyuniversity rul e.
6147,probably . do yoh knlow taht average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay ? what do you think about it ?
6148,i played football ij hs ad there's a lot of standing around so o believe it . what i can't believe i sthat the u . of iowa has a pink lokcer room for visitors .
6149,i heard about it . hy do they do tyhat ? why pink ?
6150,i ehare there are colors that calm and subdue like pink . some jailsa re that color . causes ford esign . . . huddle are circular sice a qb named hubbwrd was daf . it maeks sense for me if one isn't deaf .
6151,i rea dabout it . he did not want the other team to read his han dsignals .
6152,"makes sense . . . wht doesn't make sense is that georgia tech , my alma mater , ran up the score 2210 against cumberland . not too proud of that . . ."
6153,ae you serious ? bu tgeorgia tecbw on though . shouldn't you be proud ?
6154,maybe if it were alabama but to humiliate poor cumberland isn't too cool . lije notl ettign saints cheerleaders dine around saints polayers doens't seem too cool .
6155,you are funny . cumberland humijliated themselves .
6156,"so your not one for chivalry it seems to be dying liuke masculinity . things change . . . int he 60's , top bowlers made more than top footblal stars ."
6157,i read about it ? now bowlers maek pennies compared to football players .
6158,that makes sense . bowlers don't have to stare down a 330 lbs . guard . nor do they have to constantly reach espn's ywllow line . do you ant to continue ?
6159,i'm good . it was nie chatting with yu . talk to you again next time .
6160,hi do you follow the nfl ?
6161,"yea , tfhe giants are my favorite team but i keep up qith all 32 teams"
6162,nice ! i'm a steelers fan . how about odell beijng traded to the browns ?
6163,"he'sx n awesome player byt becomes a liability due to his temperament , the giants aren't gonna be doing too well even if they kept him i just wish they go tbeter picks for him"
6164,i avre3e . that trade cauht nme off gbuard when i saw it last night . now on to some facts . . lol the university of iowa painted their viitors lockerr oom comlpetely pink . no idez why !
6165,mayeb iowa thinmks the pink locker room will cause the visiting team to play worse
6166,"lol maybe . in the 1690's top bowlers mad etwice as much as top footbal,s tars of that era . way different now i'm sure ."
6167,"yea i never even tgought bowlers mde much money , let alone more than football stars"
6168,"i know ! i think bowling was really popular back the nalogn with horse racing , boxing , and baseball . all 3 of those sports have chbanged in fan attraction okver the decades ."
6169,"yea , sports are constantly evolving , .ike the invention of the circular huddle by paul d hubbard"
6170,was he the deaf qb who invnted it so the other team couldn't read his han signals ?
6171,"yea , i wonder if hte only lrft handed qb kellan moore invented any special techniques"
6172,you would think he would have something different in his delivery of the ball .
6173,"yea , i wondet if alex smith has different mechanics considring he's really smart , he started college as a junior"
6174,that's a great story of his ! once in he completed and graduated with a bachelor's deegreer in onmly 2 year !
6175,"yea he's a samrt dude bu ti'm not so sure about bakerm ayfield k eh considered playing gazmes professiona,lly instead of playing football"
6176,i know that sounds crazy . how about former patriotds rb genjarvus greenellis . he never fumbled the ball in his nfl career ;
6177,"that's pretty cool , i wnder if paying for bill belichick had any thing to do with greenellis never fumbling"
6178,might hav3 . do you know what the highest scoring footblal game ever 3as ? it was nice chatting by the way .
6179,"i know georgia tech scored 222 point bacjk in 191q6 , i wonder if they cheated at a;l"
6180,haha maybe they did . what a bloiwout ! sorry i have to rub . have a good day !
6181,hi ! do you followe football ?
6182,"i , somewhat .d o you ?"
6183,a little here and there . i enjoy it more when nmy team js deoing well .
6184,i heasr that . no fun to wqtch a bad team . ig uess hte chargers are doin gpretty well .
6185,i agree . their last victofy over arizona sure was dominant !
6186,"yeah , 4510 is no joke ! not as big a victory as georgia tech over cumberland in 1916 . did you see that score ?"
6187,"yeah , i am no tsure how that is even possible ! 2220 ? its like they were scoring the whole game !"
6188,when you break it down they probably ha dto score like a touchdown a minute or someth9ng ? guess fumberland's defense dihd't show up that day !
6189,"yeah , nor their offsnse . probably a lot of defensive points scored too ."
6190,grue . if they were playing at iowa i would blame their performance on the color of the visitor's loce rroom . pink !
6191,"i wonder whyt zhade of pink it izs ? more powdery , neon , magenta like ?"
6192,good question . my guess would be whichever messes with their oplonents heads te most .
6193,"speaking lf colors , did yiu know espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow line ?"
6194,"no , i didn't know that . it has completely changed watching a game on tv . makes it easier anhyway ."
6195,it certainly doe s. when my mom when to my brothers first live hs game she didnt undertand at first whyt he line wasnt there .
6196,that's funny ! i can't belidve benjarvus greeellis never fumble . that seems inmpossible !
6197,it does . i wonder how many carries he had in the game . even some of the greats fumble da bit .
6198,that's another good quesgion . it'd be way less impressive f he only had a couple of touches a gmae .
6199,or per a short career .
6200,very true . hard to believe tom brady at on the bench in high school !
6201,"i tis , they definitely didnt recognize the talent ans potential in front of them !"
6202,"no doubt , i bet they feel like fools now ! it's been fun . have a great day !"
6203,are you a fan of the nl ?
6204,"i am , especially the vikings ! how about you ?"
6205,"i like the redskins , but i'm from that area . did you know kellna moire is the only oeft hande dquarterback ib the nfl ?"
6206,that izs crazy to eblieve gecause there have been so many great left handed quarterbacks in the league !
6207,"yeah ,5 here has been . i wonder if it is a function of setting up the offens e?."
6208,maybe its because a lot of plays go to the right ? i would be curiou sto see with all the technnology they have !
6209,"yeah , tyat would be pretty cool . appaently there are chips in the shoulder pads ."
6210,is that so ? is it to track player movement on the field ?
6211,"i think it is , but i'm not sure . they also have cips in the ball ."
6212,"that is awesome ! i heard tghat it tracks velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location !"
6213,interesting l. is teh data shwred with both teams ?
6214,i'm sure it's fgor the league haha . maybe epn uses it too . you kn0ow they won an emmy for the yellow line ?
6215,for th efirst down marker ? that's pretty cool !
6216,it is ! did you ever hear about the georgia tech and cumberlan dgame that was 2220 ? that would be sad to see haha .
6217,"wow ! that is a crazy score , is that real ?"
6218,it did ! in 1916 lol . they must have been psyched out with their locker room being pink like the iowa hawkeyes do to their opponejta .
6219,"hilarious , you would think that would mkae the other tezam angry though ."
6220,i bet ! would you rather been a football playef or bowler in the 190's when bowlers made twice as much as football players ?
6221,"that would be pretty crazy k, i'm actually not a bad bowler . well , nice chatting with you !"
6222,"i'm a terr5ible bowler haha . nice chatting wiht you as well , gavge a great day !"
6223,you too ! have a good one !
6224,"hllo , how are you ?"
6225,"good , how about yourself '"
6226,"pretty good , do you knw anything about football ?"
6227,"yes , i do . ."
6228,"so , i am trying to understand what's going on with article section 1 . whatever galette has caused , he slolwy ranked lower . . ."
6229,i heard junior galette from washintn might be a free agent next gear .
6230,"interesing , . . . agent for one of the players ?"
6231,"he going to see if a new team want sto signh im enxt year . he probably won't garnr much interes t, because he's very injury prone . ."
6232,"true ,s ince he njured his achilles ."
6233,"plu shis sack numbers were down . he use to be good when he played for the new orlean ssaints , but i think his best days are behind him ."
6234,"well , he seemed overwhelmed from the start ."
6235,"his current team reaoly cut his playing time , which according to him , lumits his opportunity to sack the qjarterback ."
6236,"and his fans are rooting for him to go back to the redskins , however , that is not easy ."
6237,junior galette has had a slew off trouble off the field . h ewas even accused of domestic violence .
6238,"i think from there , he slowly went downhill ."
6239,"plus , there are a lot better young players on thw redskinhs , namely rya nanderson ."
6240,"that is true ,. but it is sadf or galette to see thed reality o his consequences that werec aused from his past ."
6241,hopefully if he stgays witht he redsoins he can retr nto his former glory . he did rank third on the 6eam inq uarterback pressures .
6242,he neds to astep up his game . get more training and keep his hea dup .
6243,"ghere is a loyal fan base in washington , i'm sure everyone wants to see him do bsetter next season ."
6244,"i agree . hopefully , he browses through this to keep his sporits up . this will remind him how much his fans believes in him ."
6245,i'll be rooting for him .
6246,what do you think bout the baltimore ravens ? they just srafted lamar jackson
6247,i'm not a huge fan because i'm a bengals fan lol . same division . i'm surprised they got rid of flacco .
6248,yeah i'm surprised too . who i syour favorite quarterback by the way ? i alsays loved to mbrady haha
6249,my favoite is probably patrick mahomes .
6250,"yeah he's good too . i also like baker mayfield a lot , especially because he ued to play halo 3 which is one of my favorite games"
6251,did you know kellan moore is the only left handed qb in the nfl ?
6252,"no i didn't iknow that , i wonder if it gives him an advantage though ? i do know about alex smith , he's actuallyr eally smart and almost got his master's degree , he even got his bachelor's and only two years before he was drated"
6253,ale smith is an awesom eguy . did you know russell wilson is still under an mlb contract ?
6254,"no i didn't know that , how do you think thqt works ? would they actually try to use him ? i like football a lot more than mlb anyway"
6255,not too sure how that works . i don't thin kthey would actually use him .
6256,well that's good . i wonder iv the nfl woudl ever use w femake player ? do you think hat will happen in our lifetime
6257,i saw they don't hav ea written rulea gaunst it . i bet we will see a female kicker befor elong .
6258,"yes i could see that . i just don't know that an nfl game only lasts 11 minutes of liv3 gameply , yo9u'd thibk that it would last longer because it van take up to twl hours on tv"
6259,"that uis crazy it is only 11 minutes of ganeplay ,."
6260,"well that is crazy . but also crazy is the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player , it's lo3er than the average earnings of a engineer . now that is crazy haha"
6261,that is very crazy . i would have never guessed that .
6262,i wold have not guessed that cheerleade4rs wouldh ave to elavse a restaurant if an actuwo player from their team came in . did you hear about the new orleahds saints ? and the ch4erleaders for them ?
6263,that's interestin . i heard ajmny teams have rules around players and cheerleaders .
6264,"rules seem unnecessary but i also don't play footblal haha , i wonder if there's a rule agaisnt painting a locker room pink for instance"
6265,lol i wonder if htat works ?
6266,i wonder that too ! i wonder i the university of iowa's recore improved or got worse qfter they painted the opposing team's locker room pink
6267,hello ! are you interested in football ?
6268,hi howa re you ? i have talked about foobtall quite a bitr ecently . i guess i ams till inrerested . lol
6269,agreed ! i wathc frequently too though . i dkid not know that the average game has only 1 minutes of ctual live gamesplay .
6270,thos eplayers have a prettys weet jb ! standing and waiting then they get to beat each other up . sweet !
6271,not sure how i would handle the same job . htey have tracdking chips ni their pads to know their speed for a reason .
6272,"yes , i hope that ghelps prevent injury and concussion . the game takes a toll on the body . i would rather be an engineer ."
6273,"yea , its a hard game to play . why an engineer ?"
6274,they make god money over the long haul . plus fewer concussions . lol
6275,"exactly ! i can run , but couldnt take a hit ! dxo you have a favorite tema"
6276,"at the moment , no . i usually just root for teh underdog ij the supsrbowl . i like to see upsets ."
6277,me too . i wish i fould have sen the rams win this y4ear .
6278,"the rams had a greart team , but it is hard to beat to m, bill and the gang ."
6279,it was a boring game because both teams played defense quite well .
6280,"yeah , a defensive battle is not a crow dpleaser . people want touchdo3na ."
6281,"yea , like wuen georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 for the highest score recorded in a game ."
6282,what was going through tbe coachs head then ? that is a horrible thing to do to another team ?
6283,mightg not be completely intentuonal . happened in a gam ehere on the upper midwest like 80 plus poitns for ome team . happens when one team gets all the right bounces .
6284,"true , but the coach should put in the third string or something . even the cheerleader smaybe ."
6285,could be fun to watch for some .t he nfl doest hat with second or tuird string
6286,"yeah , its only fair . if your team isw inning by that much , you should ease up . it is a s;ort , not a war . anyway , great chat !"
6287,you top ! have a great day !
6288,did you know there is a uyniversity team whose visiting loicker room is painted pinl ?
6289,yes . i did know that . it is iowa . i think that is great comprti6ion .
6290,"ya i would like tos es some stats to see ifg that , on average , affect the playersw , i bet it doee ,a lso crazy that in the 60's bowlers amde more money thast foobtall players back then"
6291,true . it is value based on audience . the nfl has the eyeballs now . i do love that yellow line that espn added to football broadcasts .
6292,"ya that's interesting , i also like that the huddle was invented by a deafq uarterback , i wonder how he would call an audible if he was deaf thouhg ?"
6293,he would call the audible by talking . only he woud not hear it . espn got an emmy for that yellow line .
6294,"ah that makes sense i guess , i don't like the nfl personally , it doesn't suprisde me that there are only baout 11 minutes of actual gameply in the average game , i thin kit is pretty boring"
6295,i agree . i greatly prefer college ball with many more plays . the global family og gamrs called football all have some way to score involving kicking . it is pretty mior in us football i think .
6296,"yes tht is true , also surprising is taht im the nfl there is no written rule against fe,ale football players , and that women could play if they met the league'sr equirrmsents"
6297,"wouldn't you be embarrassed to be the coach of a jv team . never win , neve rscore , have tom brady as you backup qb and never let him polay ?"
6298,"yeah that would be embarrassing , also its crazy that on average an engineeer makes more in his lifetime than the average nfl player , i wonder if its because of ghe injuries they can get"
6299,it is juwt a short career . the average running back lqsts 4 years . the qbs today make a lot though . iag9ne if gaker mayfield had quit football to be a gamer . he would not have been cashing the big checks that he does today .
6300,"ah inter3sting , that is true , i saw that baker was the halo 3 champion of his college , i was really good at hali 1 and 2 i won a lot opf tournament when i was younger , did you eve play games ?"
6301,"never played halo , but i went to oklahoma university so i watched every college game he played . alex smith took so manya p tests that he entered college as a junior . my grandson is taking a lot which will save his parents money ."
6302,"ah that is good , i took 4 ap tests wehn i went to college and passed all of them , so i saved money , still have some student loans but it i smore managable than it ktehrwise would be haha"
6303,do you play nfl fantasy football . you play 17 weeks from sept tk dec even though each team only plays 16 games .
6304,"no i don't play that , i have friends who do and they always lose money haha . i did see that there is political fantasy that you can play , on whether each side passes certain bills and such , that's probably mort o my liking becaise i follow politics more than football"
6305,it is hard t0 be an optimist when one follows politics closely . we are so polarizex . i wouldn ot mind giving political fantasy a try .
6306,"yes i agree , it is bad because it can make you depressed but unfortunately it interests me and has an actual affect on my ljfe , so i pay tgentin to it , do you play fantasy football ?"
6307,no . but my grown son pwlys in 5 leagues and makes betwee n500 and 800 each year .
6308,"well tha tis impessive , i know tere is luck but apparentlu ksill if he can wi nthat consistetnly , anyway great talking with you !"
6309,"hi , how are you ?"
6310,i'm good . but jhst frustrated with the buccaneeras for loing so horribly go the bears !
6311,"i don't kno wmuch about footbll , though i've hsard some things . are you a big fan ?"
6312,"i wztch it from time to tie . do you know wuhay a quartrnack , 9ften referred to as a qab , is ?"
6313,"yeah , that is the most important position on thet eam , right ? touchest he ball on every play ?"
6314,"exactl . but you see , the main quarterback for the buccaneers didn't get much chance to play agains tthe bears , and thatl ed to their disaster ! makes me so upset ."
6315,that's too bd . who are the big nam4 qbs in the league now ?
6316,i'd say the best has to be tom brady . but di dyou know that his high school team never even let him play ! ?
6317,hwat ? that's strnage . how did he get to play in college then ? i hought you had to be a star to do that .
6318,"i have no idea . but i think the buccaneers' defens9ve coordinator mike smith needs to go back, to college ! he let tampa score six touchdowns against them ! so dumb !"
6319,"well , that should be hte 4nd of his job . there are plenty 0f high school jobs ou5 there i'm sure . maybe he could coach a girl's team, ."
6320,"ha ha , true . and oops , i meant he let the bears sdore six touchdowns , m bad . my anger got me flustered there ha ha ."
6321,the nfl has no written rule agains female players . do you think we'll ever see women players ?
6322,we cojld ! mayb3 one or two in the future . if they ever play against the university of iowa the ni' msure they'll appreciate the pink locker room there !
6323,i guess mayb the bucs defensive guy would suffer from pink locekrroom syndrome or somehting .
6324,"some kind of syndrome , that?s for sure . theg've got a lot of issues . one of their players , winston , was even accused of gr0oping a woman az few years back . sad state they're in ."
6325,i don't understand the need for that behavior . maybe that's why no saints have a ruoe about cheerleaders with players .
6326,"yeah , maybe that's why thag weird rule exists ah ha ! do you think they actually force the cheerleaders to leave when a plsyer walks in the restaurant ?"
6327,"i have to wonder what the consequences ar e. the pkayers might get fined , or the cheerleaders firedf , or sojething . i don't know . it seems sexist ."
6328,"very sexist , inded . i think they ened to use one of their bye weeks to tyhink 0ver that rule nad update it to meet moden stanrards ."
6329,"true . anyway , great chat !"
6330,same to you . hope you have a better day than those buccaneers hd . bye !
6331,dk you lik3 football ?
6332,i do . i am a fan of the ravens and lama rjackon . you ?
6333,i like the patriots who are like the lannsters of football
6334,i have never heard of the lannisters . i do know that the ravens are implementing the prostyle offense after watching ;hiladelphia tear apart the patriots defense with it .
6335,oh lannister is a reference to gamws of thrones
6336,gltcha . we have a great center namedb zmean he was on alabqma when they won hte natioanl championship .
6337,which position do you follow ?
6338,"i like watching all of the players sometimest he quarterback hadns it off to the erunnign back , other times he does a pass to a receiver ."
6339,i also like how the quarterbakc is the core of any offnesive
6340,yes the quarterback makes the decision about wat to do depending on what the defense is doing . h eis in charge .
6341,i wonder how hard it is for kellan moore as a lefty
6342,yes he is the only left handed quarterbacxk . alex smiht is a quarterbck who was woroing oj his maste4s degreew hen he got drafted ! he is smart !
6343,did you know the huddle was created by a deaf quartereback ?
6344,yes so they could hide their signals from the other team ! thagt is brilliant i think !
6345,i woncer what paul hubbard's performance was like though
6346,i am not sure . probabl better tham the other quarterback in tom brady's high school . his coach would never even start tom !
6347,either he hated tom ot just wanted to spareh im the humiliation since the team was having the worst seaso nin history
6348,yes that is prettyc razy especially since tom went on to win 4 super bowls
6349,wasn't h eliket he biggest steal i nfl history ?
6350,without a doubt the super bowl is the ultimate championship in the nf and he has won it 4 times
6351,"indeed . in zny case , thanks for chatting . i hope you have a wojcerfuld ay ."
6352,did you watch the playoffs this weekend for the nfl ?
6353,"i didn't , you ? did the panthers win ?"
6354,"i don't think so , but i' not sure . the saints and patriots won . the washington redskins had been humiliated by the saints in a prior week"
6355,did you see this game ? the green bay packers got trounced by the detroot lions .
6356,i 2atched the eagles get beat by the saints . . .l too bad . the redskins coach jay gruden told les carpenter the teamj ha s a' cloud limin gover our head with issues we have to clean up . ? i don't think they cleaned them up because i didn't see the fedskins in ht eplayoffs . did you ?
6357,"no , i don't watch footbaplm yself . i do see this too . jos hnorman ,t he highest paid playert at the position , is ' in love with bein a celebrity righ tnow and not necessarily being a football player . '"
6358,"with that much money an attention , that must bew hat one aims for . new england hadt he seventhworst pass rush in hte nfl this season but still made it to the playoffs"
6359,apparently the patriotsh ave trouble getting a passer . thats got to really affect the gamw they play .
6360,maybe thy need some pink in tbeir locker roolms like the uniersity of iowa visiting football locker rooms . ytat way fhe bright colors can waken them up .
6361,they need it ! the patriots also have the 7th worst pass rush in the nfl .
6362,"yes , that's what i said previously . i like hoe i know when the team will get a first dowm because of the yellow line superimposed on the field . did you hear that espn invented that and got an emmy for it ?"
6363,"i'm sorry , i didn't see that earlier . i did hear that about espn . i also heard that forme rpartiots rb benjzrvus greenellis has enver fumbled the football in his nfl career ."
6364,"mus tbe a fantastic player . i'm surprised i haven't hearc more about him . the circl ehudlde was created by paul d . hubbard a deaf quarterback so ohter teams couldn't get his hand signasl . great idea , huh ?"
6365,very good idea !t otal;y femade football . glad h egets the cred8it for it . did you see the female football ref ? the nflh as no written rule against female players ; women would un fact be allowed if they met te league's eligibility requir4mens . shd is huge . i bet she could plaf ootball .
6366,"no , i didn't know tha . tha tis cool . did you hear about the highest score ever football gawme thatw as 2200 with georgia tech winning ."
6367,that had to be in the very beginn8ng of football since an avbe5age nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
6368,top bowlers in the 60's made twice as much as top football stars .
6369,id you know that tom brady went to junipero serra high school ?
6370,"yes , that is correct . k heard they didn'6t even staret him at qharterback and now he's a 4t ime super bowl champ !"
6371,"i wonder if it hurt his onfidence back then ? a,ex smith sur eis smart too ."
6372,it must hzve made him work harder . you'r enot kidding ! smith took so many ap tests and entered university as a junior . what a hardworking individual .
6373,gyood morning ! do you watch football ?
6374,morning ! i do ! i try to watch it everty week duringt he regualr season . how about you ?
6375,same here ! do you watch college football ?
6376,"nah not really , thatzs a little bit too much for me to follow and the teasm are always changing around"
6377,"oh that's too bad . those games can get really good ! speaking of , the highest scoring football game ever was a college game . georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 back in 1916 ."
6378,holy cow ! i wonder how that halpened haha tahts such a huge amount of points scored
6379,it really is ! i wish there was a video record of it to see just what happened . i can only guess that umberland had no defese whatsoever .
6380,i know id like to watch that gqme and see what happened . did you know snoop dogg wrote the fight song for his high school team ? haha it must have been a good song
6381,i didn't know that ! that;s prwtty cool !
6382,and apparently the highest paid peopel in the us defdnse dept are all football coaches frm the servuce branch teams . that seems unnecessary to me
6383,"you know , it does to me too l in the defense dept the highest paid people should be the people defending the country . back in the '60s bowlers made twice as much as football players ."
6384,i wonder how muc hbowler swere paid ? or how little a footblal player was paid . it is definitely the oppisite today
6385,"that's for sure . now football is so popular hat like you said , coaches in the defense dept are high paid an tv stations can win emmys for making yellow lines ."
6386,well the yellow line 4spn made is revolutionary and changed the televis4d game forever for the better
6387,"true and 9 love it too . it makes the game much more exciting to know nust how far a team has to go to get htat first down . it's just , an emmy ?"
6388,eh i dunno ! they give out some strange awards apparently haha
6389,"i guess they do at that ! oh hey , have youh eard about the universk6y of iowa's locker room for visiting teams ?"
6390,"yea i heard it wae painted pink , must be some kind of psychological warfare !"
6391,i thoink so too ! i'ts kind of funny in a way also . i like that they are so blatantly kobvious with hteir warfare .
6392,i know right ? did you know kelle nmoore is the only elft handed qb in the nfl ?
6393,"no ! i had no idea ! honestly thlugh , i gues si just don't pay attention to what hand they throw from . sounds like i mayn ee dto . well , it's time for me to go now . it's been great hcatting with you ! have a great day !"
6394,hey dso you think the ram will go undefeated this year ?
6395,"ui how are you ? um , i dont know .h ow did they do last year ?"
6396,"i think they played pretty well last year , but right now they are at 8 and 0 , znf it is halfway through the year so they have a chanc eto go undefeated"
6397,"well , i guess they could . i dobt follow nfl too much until late n the season ."
6398,well let me ask you this who is yor favorite quarterback ? i ike kellen moore because he's lefthanded haha just likie m4e
6399,is he still in the league ? i wonder why there is only one lefty .
6400,"yes i wonder that too . and i think he is but i'm nolt 100 percrent sure , what do you think about alex smith by the way ?"
6401,is he hte qb that did college in like 10 minutes or siomething ?
6402,haha well he passed a lot of ap tests and was working onh is master's degre ebefore he was drafted so he's definitely a fenius
6403,3wow . the guy has the kind of mind you need for q . is he still playing ?
6404,i think he is . but i don't watch a lot ot football so i'm not one hundred percent sure . d you know how the cirdculwr huddle was inv4nted by the way ?
6405,i figured it was just a basic part of the game .
6406,"no it was actually invented by a deaf quarterback , he would use the huddle to block the other tfeam from seeing his hand signs"
6407,"oh , i guess that makess ense . i am amazed that he could play . he must have been quite good ;"
6408,"yes eh probably was . it'z interesting though that women are actually allowed to play i nthe nfl if tuey qualify , there is no rule against them playing"
6409,i cnat' imagine a women who emet the physical requirements to deal with the contact positions . ma7be kicker ?
6410,"yeah i thik a kicker could be possibl e. it's crazy though that th4y use tracking chips on players and the balls now , that way they can track th elocatioh and speed oft he players on the fiwld , hopefully they iuse this to help prevent injuries"
6411,ki think the data could be used for many purposes . maybe it could help with safety at the college and high school level too .
6412,yes i hope aso . did you hear abouth ow cheerleaders ar treated in the nfl ? apparently7 tbey ca't even dine im the same reataurant aw a player without having to leave
6413,"noe ating with players ? odd outdated sexist rule . anyway , great chat !"
6414,yes itw as ag reqtc hat ! and keep an eye out for benjarvus greenellis o nthe patriots ! he' snever fumnle the football and i hope he never does !
6415,"hey tehre how iften do you watch the nfl ? you watched on yv o rdo you go to ga,es"
6416,"boh . i go to games occasionally . not as often as snoop dog , but i go"
6417,haha i agree with you . i do go to tames but i'ts very rare . i mosfly watched them on tv . did you know that th eaverage nfl game only lasts zbout 11 minutes if you are counting the live gameplay ? that seems sko short
6418,whoa . i want a refund . but these days even a high school stadium cos t60 million bucks . .s o im not holdin gmy breath
6419,"yep i wouldn't hold my breath i there haha . do you know any engineers btw ?a pparently an engineer wkill make mofre , opver his or her lifetime , then an nfl player . that's because nfl players get injured and definitely don't work their entire lives"
6420,"plus , there isn'tr isk of injury like ther eis in football . perhaps the engineers can tweak those chips embedded in the palyers uniforms to measure brain injuries"
6421,"that's a good point ! i wish that all those brain injuries weren' tthe case , but it is good that they use those tracking chip sto measur ethijngs like speed nad acceleration oft he players . i just hope that they6 take those off after they leave so that they're not trske din their ormal lives"
6422,yeah . . . dont want the wie to know where ur going .
6423,"haha that's a good point . did you hear about the ne worleans saints cheerleaders though ? definitely a weird thing in my opinion , how theh nave to leave restaurants if players zre there"
6424,i wonder if they got chips in them too . hen th3y can be warned before entering the rwestaurstn
6425,haha i guess they shoyld do that . th3en theyc ould be sure that teh two arw never in teh same room . who is your favorite quarterback by the way ?
6426,well i like the way sam donald recovered from ghis first pass . . . but russell wilson;s so versatile he could play baseball
6427,"yep that's a good point . do you baker mayfiekd byt he way ? he was a bigtime gamer anda lmoast went pro , but at thw last minut ehe changed overt o playing football"
6428,wow . almost as impressive as throwinf a td pass to yourself
6429,"that skunds incredible ! who did that ! i want to watch a video of it . also sounding incredible , is alex smith , he actually finished his bachelor's in two years and was going for his master's before he got drafted"
6430,brad johnson did it . won a super bowl .
6431,"oh that'sc ool . have you ever bowled or wath bowling on tv before ? apparently top bowlers in the 60s made twice as much a setop football players , there's a fomplete reversal"
6432,wow . alex smith should give it a try . he's smart enough to learn anything fast
6433,"yep i agree with you . i'm sure he awas smart enough to use the circular hucdle , ny the way that was invented by a deaf quarterback !"
6434,interesting . smarter than a circlar firing squad nod oubt . its not ocket science but there has only been one rocket scietist coaching in the nfl
6435,that is interesting . i wonder if he's the best coach or not lol . did you ever hear anout the highest scoring football game of all time by the way ? maybe that was the rocket sci3ntist coach lol
6436,"hello there , do you watch the nfl"
6437,"hey ! yes i do . sadt he seasonm is over . i watched the super bowl l, t was just ok this year . how baout you ? i am actually from seattle so i love the seahawks but unfortunately they fidn't live up to the hype !"
6438,"nice , 7eah i watch the games sometimes . did you know women can play too ?"
6439,yeah i didn't know that was allowed to be honest . i think they are smart by not playingit is a brutal game . i thinkt hey ahould be qb ifr anything because they are the most protected .
6440,yeah i guess . would be interesting to see them in the game . i mean it only lasted for 11 minutes
6441,"true . adn i hope they wouldn't do it for the money because the average lifetiem earnings of an engineer is higher than a nfl playerjust too many injuries i think . especially if there wereg irls , they ju taren't built the same ."
6442,yeah ig uess a career in engineering is a smarter choice .d id you hear about that rule for teh new orleans cheerleaders ?
6443,yeah i guess they don't want their players beimg distracted ? interesting tactic for sure . they sur eare protective of their players . the nfl even puts tracking chips in shoudler pads !
6444,yeah i hope they can use those statistics like velocity l rotation and such to improve the game and reduce concussions
6445,yeah me too . they really ened to do something . i like high scoring games but the highes6 ever reported football game was 2220 . i couldn't believe that . seems unsportsmanlike .
6446,i know . i bet you georgia gech still brag about that . qhat a game that must have been
6447,yeah i am sure . another crazy college foobtall fact is that university of iia's locker room for visiting teams is painted pink .
6448,"wow , thwt does not xound nice . d8d you know espn won an emmt once ?"
6449,yeha for creating that yellow first kine marker ! it hinkt hey deserve it htat was a geeat creation and chnaged he way te game is watched for sure .
6450,yea hthat is true for sure . do y9ou know benjarvus greenellks i s
6451,oh yeah the patriots running back who never fumbled the football ! that is truly amazing .
6452,that is for sure . what a guy . and did you know kellan moore is the onlky qb thay is left handed ?
6453,that;s surprisin g. j would think there would be more . th eplayer alex smit htook so many ap tests in high school that he enterwed college as a junior . what a smart guy .
6454,"i know , must have planned his life pretty well . good fir him . do you know who invented the circular hddle ?"
6455,"very interesting . yes paul hubbard apparently brcaue he was deaf and needed a bette rway t hear . and they even no wuse it to this day . just became a tradition ig uess ,f unny how thzat works !"
6456,"i know , what as mart guy . it was really nice chatting wift you ."
6457,hui are you a football fan ?
6458,"i love football m, especially the nfl , how aboutyou"
6459,i'm a bi gfan ! ou tof the 32 teams i nthe nfl do you have3 a favorite ? i'm a steelers fan .
6460,"of the 32 , i would say i am a vikings fan , both our teams didnt make the playofdfs this ear !"
6461,nope ! lol did you know that the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink ? must have done tha to mess with who theyg were playing .
6462,"that is true m i hagve seen it , i live where the stadium is ! it is to calm and relax the other tam"
6463,that's interesting ! cool . un the 1960's top bowlers made twice as muxh as op football stars of that rta . times have sure changed since then .
6464,"that is crazy , i wnder what the salary difference is now ! speaking of college teams , did you hear about the 2220 win in 1916 ?"
6465,holy smokes ! who beat the heck out of who ? .l
6466,"georgia tec beat cumberlanf hat bad . i would have wquit and walked orf the field at like 100 0, lo."
6467,that's what i call a blowout ! did you know that espn won an emmy for creating the superimpoed yellow first rown lin eon tv ?
6468,"i did not know that , that is awesome ! i love that yellow line , i used to think it was really as a kid lol"
6469,lol here's a good stat : former patriots rb benjarvusg reenellis nwver fumbled the football in his nfl career .
6470,"wow , that is an incredible feat on his part . i feel all rbs do now is fumble the ball . he needs to teach a clinic or something"
6471,right ? did ytou know that in an azverage nfl game there is only 11 minutes of oive gameplay ? that's crazy . i hate how they don;t utilize every second of the clock . especilaly at the ned of the first half or ned of a game . when i was a kid they used to throw hail marys at teh end of the first hal fregardless of thes core . now they just kneel on the ball wether they are ahead or bebind .
6472,"lol tnhat is crazy . the actualg ame is like 3 hours , talk about boring now ! lol , i loved hail marys"
6473,itw as more exciting back then . when theyw ould run out of bunds at any point in the game ht eclock would stop . now i think thatr uel only applies in the final 2 minutes of each half .
6474,"yea i think i tdoes too . bow htey use tracking chips i nplayers , have you heard this ?"
6475,i was readibng about it . makes you wonder f they can program the chips somehowt o change the flight of the ball and make it go to the chip tht's in the wid ereceivers shoulder pads .
6476,"i bet it can , i am sure these chops are created by engineers hwo will make mor emoney over their lifetim ethan players . it was so nice xhatgting with yo7 !"
6477,i had a good time ! thanks !
6478,do you watch muchn football ?
6479,"hello ! yes i'm a fan to some extent , and yourself ?"
6480,i don't know as much about it as i probably shold living on the the heart of football country but i5t does seem like a fascinating game .
6481,"ahah well it depends , do you life hwere football is association football , aka soccer in the us ? or are you somewhere where american football is called gridiron footnall or even gaelic football ?"
6482,"around here it is a mix o fboth , it used to be all american football gring up but now soccer is kind of taking over ."
6483,"zhh that's fair . i think they're both slow paced for me . although the highest american football score was somehow 2220 , which seems ihsane ."
6484,you would tink at a certain poin tthe other team would just forfeit the game . i mean once you reach 60 pooints there really is no way you zre goig to catch them .
6485,"oh i'm sure , i can't imaginet he feeling of the other team . i wonder what's wo5ae , losing like that or being the visiting team to university of iowa . they paint rehir visiting locker room pink , it seems demoralizijh for sure ."
6486,that does zee mlike a very iowa thing to do . i wonder how many times their qb fumbled to cause that much of a run on the score .
6487,"you know who they should uaveh ad inbstead ? benjarvus greenellis , i hear that running back never fumbled the football his entire carser ."
6488,that is quite the accomplisghment . i wonder if he got any wndorseemnts out of tit;e like that . i can imagine there are a number of products he could d likeg lues or gloves .
6489,oh yeah . i'd definitely hope he at keast got some award recogn8tion for it . i know htey do care about that in football . like espn won an emmy for the creation of the yelliw first down line .
6490,that srems like as trange thin gtow in an emmy for . i guess it wax an innovation at the time th0ugh and certainly msde it easier for the fansa t home to see the details of the play .
6491,"oh yeah , but at loeast its hows there's more interrst in the sport now ; i don't think it would have ever happened back in the 1960s k, when even the top bowlrers earned more than footbaqll stars ."
6492,i think a lot of that at the time had to do with how long the caqreer was too . z bowler can play for a much longer time than a footballer due to all those injuries they sustain .
6493,"ahh that's very fair . at the same time , i'd thin individual players are more profitable in football . like quarterbacks , they fan be very unique , which i'm sure earns more in endorsement opportunities ."
6494,i've always thought that the qb is overtated . i know that he calls a lo tof the shotd and throa sbut it seems like the rec4eivers and evne the defensive line do most o rhe work .
6495,"that's an argument to be amde . sometimes i even freel quarterbacks ahve their mind outside of the game . baker mayfield almoet didn't even go into fkotball seriously , and thought about quittng to pursue compegitive gaming inxtead ."
6496,competitive gaming ? is that really a hting ? opw do you compete with video games ? why would you compete with video games ?
6497,"yeah i thimk it's interesting , on the other hawnd not lal hobbies seem like a waste of time . like alsx smith too kso many ap tes6s in hig hschool he entered university already ass a junior ."
6498,i can respect that thoug h. i htink it ix gret when these playersm ake sure they have a bacikup plan go fall back on because football doesn't last forever .
6499,hi there ! looking forward to hat wity you !
6500,me too ! so qhat do you think about the eagles this season ? are you a f0otball fan ?
6501,"football yes ; , i mean a game when players use their feet to kick the ball ; ,f ootball ; ,"
6502,what time ars you a fa nof ? its kind of hard to pick with all the teams in the nfl
6503,"nfl ? no , i tholugh tyou said football 9 like manchaster united : , red devils !"
6504,"oh , i see , i like barcelona , im a messi fan actually i think he is a gr3eat player ."
6505,"he surely i s: , i'm from poland so i vote for lewandowski ! : ,"
6506,hw is also a great player ! do you think lewadnowski w9ll go to real madrid at some point ' it would be a great team for him .
6507,"he might you know it6's all about the money . . . he is kind of a primadonna bi ti guess he has a right to be one ; , he scores plenty of goal ; ,"
6508,"yeah he doe , what ohter players from poland do you like or se ehaving a big future ?"
6509,grzegorz krychowiak seems like the miost successful but on national team he played terrible . . .
6510,"i see , didnt really followed poland on the last world cup ,s o howcome you dontl ife american football, ?"
6511,"it's a good think you didn't5 pag attention to polish team this worldcup . . . that was jus tembarrassing and shameful . . . they played terrible . . . id on't know , american football is just not as much appealing to me do you like it ."
6512,"well my favorite team didnt even make it lol , and yeah i do ike it , did you know a team lost y2 20 once ."
6513,is that a lot ? what is like a regular score ?
6514,"yeah that is a lot ! it would be like losing 200 in a soccer game , and regularily teams score p to 60 points and gzmes are tight ."
6515,wnat ? how the heck two teasm lkike that could even meet on the fieod ? totally different level . . .
6516,"yeah , that or the other team was blind , apparently both teams were at college level ."
6517,"there ha dto be sonek ind of a bet behind the scenes : , a dare or something like rthat ; ,"
6518,"definetely , i would retire from football after a loss like that one lol , kind of like the brazilean socder team in the 2014 world cup , just a total humiliation ."
6519,"yeah , but that was brazul . . . kids there ee being born with soccer bqlls xstuck to their feet . . . quite a humiliation : ,"
6520,i know and in their own turf .
6521,hdy did you know the nfl actually allows for female players ?
6522,"well , they xhould . everybody is equal ."
6523,"yha assuming that they met the3 requirements , i thinl that'd be interesting and i could see it happening for sure"
6524,"well , think about it , in high school , they oppened foobtall to b9th genders ."
6525,"yaz , i don't personally watch sports but it is interesting , also it d9oesn't surrise me that on aerage an nfl game only ahs 11 minutes of actual gmae play , i prrsonally think football is pretty boring"
6526,"the only sport i wsatch and enjoy the most is basketball . i feel football and baseballa re boring . after the 7ht inning , i'm ya2ning ."
6527,"well did you know that the new ypork saints cheerleaders aren't allowd to eat in the same restaurant as the saints palyers ? i dont' know why but that is true , the nf lis weird"
6528,"yes , i hafe heard abouf that . i wonder why . sexual harassnent ?"
6529,"ga that's a good point i don't know , i read that ipwa painted thsir visiting team's locekr room pink , i wonder iv that is considered harassmetn"
6530,"maybe , they need to put an end to it ."
6531,were you aware that in the 60's professional bowlrers made more tahn professional football players ? thats the complete opposite of today
6532,"i bet it is the opposite o ftdawy , as well . i feel that football players do way more than bowlers ."
6533,"yes i think so , do you ever bowl ? i used to as a kid but i don't like how your score depends on previous frames , you amd your friend could both get 8 strikes but depending on the order you would have different scores"
6534,"well , i am not a bower . i had a tu5key in one sitting , but that was it . it depends whether you have spares or nt , as well ."
6535,"ya one interesting thing about football though is that th ehuddle was creted by a deaf quaterback , the circle of p0eoppe blocked the other team from seeign his hand signs"
6536,imagine how muc hmoney he is making .
6537,"ya i wonder if he patented it , also tha tkellan moore os hte only left handed quaterback that plays in the nfl , i wonder if that gives him an advantage o rnit"
6538,"well , i heard as a rumnor , but others say that it is a fact . however , eople who are left handed can get 8into small or large accidents ."
6539,"hmmm ya i don't kno w i know that they are supposed to be more artsy , also they are mor elikel to be gay , but that's all i've geard about left handed people myself"
6540,"reallt ? well , my cousins aren't gay so those are assumptions that you have ."
6541,"yes the studies show it is more kikely but that doesn't mjean it is 100 percent certain of course , my autn is left handed but not gay , wouldn't matter to me if she was or not though"
6542,do you watch football ?
6543,"hello , yes i do . what about you ?"
6544,"i do , every sunday that it is on ."
6545,did you know alex smith took so many ap classes in high schoolt hat he was qa junior when he started college ?
6546,i diudn' tknow that . he must be a very smart guy then .
6547,i think he is verty smart . the circlar huxdle came about due to a deaf qb .
6548,"yeah , it wasd one to hidxe the ahnd suignals . who knew ?"
6549,"ye; , i would havs never guessed that was the reason behind the circular huddle ."
6550,that s pretty cool . did you know there is only one lefty qb in the nfl ?
6551,i didn ot know that . who is the qb ?
6552,it is kellan moore . i don't know if he is any goof though .l
6553,very cool . i know vico was a good left back in the day before he got into trouble .
6554,"yea h, he was a great qua4terbafck too . you have to winder what the heck he was thinking ."
6555,not a very smart decision on his part .d iud you known ikwa paintred the oppoeing team locker room pink ?
6556,i did . it sounds like cheatig to em . what do yout hink ?
6557,i think so too . in the 9160's the top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars .
6558,that is pretty copol . it reminds me of that move kingpin with bill murray about bowlers in the 60s and 70s .
6559,haha yes ! the highes tfootball score ever was 2220 .
6560,"yeah , cumberland got crushed . well , nice chatting with you !"
6561,it was good chatting with you too . i bet that game was super boring .
6562,"i wonder if they even there . lol . nice chat , have a good day !"
6563,"hey there , do you wach nfl ?"
6564,"hey ! not so much bu ti did watch the superbowl this year , what abou tyou ?"
6565,yah only during superbowl reloy . i mean it is such a lng game but there is only 11 minutes of playtime .
6566,"yed that is very dissappointing , were you aware that you could actually have female players on the nfl ? there is no rule against it"
6567,"i like that rule , if youm ake the cut you paly ."
6568,"yup , if you're good enough you can play , i don't lik esthe rule with the saints cheerleaders though , did you hear about that ?"
6569,about them not being able to eat in the samer estaurant as the nfl player ?
6570,"right ,a nd then if they ar eeating in z restaurant and a player walks in , then the cheerleader has to leave , tah tdoesnt seem fair"
6571,not fair at all . i rea;lly winder whqt ths is alk about though
6572,do you kno about the chips that the nfl uses to trakc the poayers and football during gameplay ?
6573,i relaly wonderw hat kind of information they are collecting and it is used for ?
6574,"yes they ca nget the speed , location and motin of al lthe players and the football apparently"
6575,so cool . dpo you know what was the highest score in a football gamer ?
6576,"i think it was like 222 to nothing or something like that , man i would feel so demoralized at that loss haha"
6577,oh yeah for sure . and espn even won an emmy for thd creation of the superimposed yellowl ine
6578,"yes , would you like to use a locker room that was painted pink ? i think i would get angry personally , espeically if it was in iowa haha"
6579,i would not mid nit but iw odner what the reason behind it was
6580,"ya i think i was to demoralize the opposing laying team sactually , it would make me angry and probably play better haha"
6581,did you kno wthere is a player who has nevel fumbled in his nfl career ?
6582,"yes he plays for the patriots , i woudl giveh im 5he ball every time ! his name is benjarvus greenellis"
6583,"yezh that is interesting about him , it was nice chatting with you"
6584,hi there ! are you a fvootball fan ?
6585,i am good how ar3 ou ? i am not a big gootball fan no . .
6586,"i ma well . i tend to only get into it i fit is near playorv time , or if my team does well . otherwise , i dont tend to follow itt oo much . i do like fun facts though . drid you know the fnl only has onel eft handed quarterbac k?"
6587,i watch the suped bowl but only for the half time
6588,i tend to watcxh for the commercials . lol .
6589,yeah they are always ood . i missed it this year were they good '?
6590,"i also missed it . it seems that tom brdy is really dementing himself as a top qb , even tho7ugh his high school jv tema refused to play him . hindsight is 20 orf 20"
6591,i see he ius pretty popular . my friend actually was in disney after the super bowl and he was there
6592,"that would be r4ally neat , i heard his wife actuallym akes more money than he does , i think she 8is a model or so,mething like that ."
6593,yeah shes a huge model . she has been modeling a long time too
6594,that's pretty cool . did you know sspn won an emmy for the invention odf the digital yellow line fdirst down marker
6595,i dod not know that . thats hilarious ! i found thet alk about hte idea of female players interesting
6596,same here . i think it would e tough for a woman to break through in most positins jst due to size . i cerainly wouldnt want to be taxkled by a 300 pound player . that would hurt .
6597,i thin kthe size ould come in their favor though as a quarter back
6598,"quite possibly , plus it is not lik,e there id a lot of game play , usually only 11 minutes per game ."
6599,i saw gthat ! i thin kthats crazy dconsidering how long the games take and how much people pay to see them
6600,"it really is , that means that out of the entire game lsss than 25 pecent is actually activ eplay , and thats just counting the time the clock runs . i think it would be a lot ore interesting if there was a running clock the whole time ."
6601,they make millions though for 11 minutes of work and thats a huge flaw jin our pay system in my personal opinion .
6602,i totally agree with you . althlough the lifetime ernings of an engineer are higher than the average football player . they also have a lot longer to wor kbecause engineering doesnt beat up your body6 quite like fo0tball .
6603,but to em an engineer is adding to the world where as football is solely for entertainment .
6604,"i totally agree ,. i thunk our priorities are severely messed up 2when some people cant afford to live and other slive in extravagnwce for doing nothing ."
6605,"yeah , it also is not benefiting our economy . all the moneh going to the wealthy means they ard spending t on hih edn goods and it never rally trickles down as it should"
6606,itn ever seems to work as it should . its been noc edchatting but i have go get goiny . have a great day !
6607,are we done then ?
6608,yes . have a great day !
6609,hey there do you ever watch football games ?
6610,yes i do !
6611,ah nice what is your favorite tewm ? i guess there are a total of 32 to pick from
6612,mine is the eagles . who is yours out of the 32 teams ?
6613,"ah i do like the patriots myself , the superbowl was definitely slow and definteily felt like the gam eon;y had 11 mins of gameplay haha"
6614,it wa sdefinitely not a fun game to watch for sure ! mkaybe if that had a woman on one of those teams it would of been a better game ?
6615,"haha ya taht is actually possible , i think oen day we will see a female player for sure"
6616,thag would be really cool ! as long as they are not saints chgeerleaders
6617,"ya they have it the worst , very nonsensical they have to leave a restaurant if qa player comes in , i think thats an outdated rule"
6618,"i agree . . . not fair for them at lal ! i wodner if that is year round , or justd uring the season ?"
6619,"ya i don't know ,. probably all the time , scary that they have chips that can track your location and motoon , hopefully they only use those on th efield"
6620,hahaaaa . . that is true . . . but i am dure they have them ins mart phones too !
6621,"oh o'm sure , at least it give nfl teams lo6s of good stats , but its scary , hopefully they don't 0ut thme on the cheerleaders !"
6622,lol ! now that would bs a lot of bouncing motion in one spot . . . ;probably hard to get god data on that !
6623,"haha thyats a good point ! do you like the quarterbakc kellan moore , is he good ?"
6624,"don't remember him that mudch . . . but i do knowh e is left handed , because i wm left handed too ."
6625,"oh interesting , and ya do youy know if that gives hiim any benefits ? like fo they have to run plays agajnst hoim differentlky ?"
6626,"probably , because he cnam ove in the opposite dsirection and throw better that wwy unlike a right hander ."
6627,"ya thats a good point , do you lie kbakewr mayfield ? he was almost a pro gamer"
6628,oh realoy ? that's crazy . . . probably a longe rcareer if he chose that ?
6629,"haha could be , he ws very dominant at halo 3 , i was good i would have liked to play him haha"
6630,hey do you like football ?
6631,"hu ! i love football . in fact , the quarterabck is my favrite position because he touhes the abll on nearly every signle offensive play and he's the leader ocf the offense . what about you ?"
6632,yeah same here ! d0 you have a favorite player ?
6633,i always loved benjarvus greenellis and one of the reasons why is because he neve rfumbled the foobtall in his entire po career . that takes serious talent and skill . what about you ?
6634,hah it definitely is . my favorite player is tom brady . eh is just too good .
6635,indeed yhe is ! whst's sad is his old jv high team refused to start him despiten eve rwinning a game or scoring a touchdown . i bet the school still kicks thmeselves to this day for that mistake .
6636,i know ! he went to my alma mater too so i have extra reason to like him .
6637,"i heard that ! ha ! i also like kellan moore due in large par tto him being the only left handed qb in the entire league . that's kind of hard to beliegre , isn't it ?"
6638,wow that is super unique . did you know women ca nt3echnically play in the nfl ?
6639,"yes they can as long as they meet tje eligibility requirements . i'm quite surprised we haven't seen a femal3 player drafted ye t, honestly ! i mean , with the average nfl game only consisting of 11 minutes of live gameplay , you'd think a woman could handle that , rjght ?"
6640,yeah i agree ! did you know iowa paints their visitor locker rooms pink ?
6641,"ih eard about that . you know , cumberland was beaten so abd by georgia tech in 1916 , 2220 , which was the highest score ever in a footbalol game , maybe they should have had a pink lckerroom for extra motivation . ha !"
6642,wow tah tis some score . it's strange that the average nfl player isn't paid too much ;
6643,"agreed . what's even crazier is , back in fhe 196s0 , the top bowlers actuallym ade more than the top football plqyers . that's depressing considering how rough football is com0ared toh ow easy bowling is ."
6644,right . you're takigbn so many hits and all the concusion info9rmstion too recently makes it startling . ahve you ever played footbal l?
6645,"so true . but hte nfl is using yracking chips they stick in the players' shoulder pads to record their eery move so hopefully it ca nhelp on some way to study how to prevent concussiohns , ,matbe !"
6646,i agree . hopefully it makes a difference . did you know alex smith took a ton of ap tests in high school that he was considered a junio in college .
6647,"that i samazing ! he must truly be a geniuzs ! speaking of geniuses , i was so happy when espn won an emmy for teh yellow first down line they create . it was so innovarive and i coul,dn't watch a game without it now !"
6648,haha that was na incredible moment . have you ever been to an nl game ?
6649,"i'd like to ! but seeing as how he regular season is only 17 wweks long fron september to december , it trly flies by wayt oo fast !"
6650,it really does . it was great talking 5o yo man !
6651,ther eis a lot of buzz hazppenin right now during the nvfl preseason . have youw atched the game ?
6652,"i d8dt watch the game but i heard it was pretty intense , th engl pre season will be interesting thouhg , i wang to see how teams are doing"
6653,yes . andrew lukc played for the first time wfter missing the previous year with a shulder injury . he did pretty good
6654,"y3ah that was really sad , getting injured , it must be hard for any player ,"
6655,luck was so excited to be back he was even excited to get sacked !
6656,do you have a favorite nfl team ?
6657,i like the redskins htey were not one of the top 6 temas from each conference who got to advance ti the playofs last year .
6658,"i see , i thougt they were going to perform better they actually didnt have a bad team , and what about the superbowl final did you have a favorite team for the game ?"
6659,o am always for anyone but the patrits .
6660,"yeah patriots have been wibning like every ga,e tahts kin dof annoying , afc conference is almos talways settled ."
6661,"yes , the national football league gaems normally only have about 11 minutes of live gameplay . the super bowl seemed worse"
6662,"the superbowl had so many interruptions l, it took forefer and it was a boring game i didnt like it at all"
6663,yes . and you think that the players make a lot o fmoney but the average ejgineer make smord ove ra lifetime .
6664,well that might b ebecause football players carreers last ab0ut 20 years and engineers work for 40 years or even more
6665,yes . it is crazy how technokogy has entered the game . there are tracking chip snow in the shoulder pads and footballs .
6666,"i now rihgt , its amazing how we can 6ell all kinds of interesting s6ats thanks to those chips , technology is sure suprixing"
6667,the chips track velocity ball speed and location
6668,"they do , so im guessing you know who tom brady is"
6669,yes he is a well known quarterback for he patrio5s and thrws a lot of passe s.
6670,"the same oen , so he studied in juniper sjerra hihg shcool and played hte qb position as well , although the coach thought he was bad and lept him on hte ebnch , the team lost so many games , it was terrible"
6671,yes . did you know there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
6672,hi how are you ? when was the last time you had a chat about football ?'
6673,right after yhe super bowl . what about you ?
6674,i hzve been cahtting about foobtall pretty frequently . lo9l i did not see the sb this yea r. dir you like it ?
6675,i did see it . it was a slow game .
6676,"i heard the previous one was better . a big comebac, at the end . who were you rooting for this year ?"
6677,enitner team . my team is the redskin s;
6678,"oh , is that the team with alex smitb ? is ue still playing in the nfl ?"
6679,i'm not sure . i don't follow it that closelya ftesr they start sucking .
6680,lol . that is funny . i usec fo follow the 49ers back in the day . and now i dont really follow them .
6681,"yeahj , i was a 49er fan when i was young ."
6682,there we4e great . really a fun teamt o watch . i liked joe montna and steve young . oots of great players and the coach was a stand up guy .
6683,"yeah , montawna was good . djd you know the nfl uses chips in the shoulder pads of players ?"
6684,"that is an interestin innovation . i fig7re that it could help with strategy , but maybe with redearch on injuries ."
6685,"probably fors trategy , the balls hav echips too ."
6686,"yeah , that is true . mayube it helps to understand the relative position of the blal when injuries occur ? i don tknow ."
6687,"yeah , somehow i think it is mostly for strategy ."
6688,"yeah , i bet the coaches want to know how the players are moving ."
6689,that's probalby true . did you know kellan moore is the only levfty in the game ?
6690,that seems odd . why only one ? do coaches dislike lefties ?
6691,"it might be easier to set the offense up witg righies . anyways , nice chatting with you !"
6692,taht is true . thanks for thev hat ! good night !
6693,"you too , have a good evening !"
6694,do you like teh nfl ?
6695,yes i do . do you like brady ?
6696,for sure i do . did you kmow he was a backup qb in high school
6697,yes nad he was never started event hough the team disd pretrty bad
6698,yeah . do you like alex smith ?
6699,"i sure do , hte guy is all brains as well , finished college in two years"
6700,yeah he took lots of ap tests in high school
6701,yeah . d0 you know who inventesd th ecircular huddle ?
6702,yes that was paul hubbard who was a seaf qb
6703,yeah and he invented that so others did not understand what he was signing
6704,yea h. do you like bkaer mayfield ?
6705,yes he is good and he considered elaving football o become a gaemr
6706,yes and he says tha the 8s really good at ha.o 3
6707,yes he says he can beat anyone in it at u of oklahoma
6708,yeah . did you know women an play in the nfl ?
6709,yes there is no trule against them playing as wlel
6710,yes as long as they mdet the requirement thwy are good to go
6711,yeah . the averageg amplay is only 11 minutes
6712,yeah and yet we are glued to the tv for hours
6713,true l enineers make more than the foobtall players over the lifetime
6714,i guess that makes sense since they hzve longe rcareers too . nice chat
6715,do you like football ?
6716,i don't mind it . i think it is a very violent sport but it can be fun to watch . what about you ?
6717,"i mea nfor a tame with only a doze no rso minufes or real gameplay , there is so much excitement"
6718,it doe sseem like a lot of the game is them in a huddle or stnding on the line waiting for the brief bursts of actions .
6719,how familiar are you with the nfl ?
6720,i know al ittle about them . it seems 6o have hte teams divided geographically and then the winning ones play each other at the end of the season right ?
6721,pretty much . the nfl's average season is 1 weeks wih each teams playing 16 games by the first week
6722,oh wow i would havet hough it was a longer season than that . i guess there is a lot of preseason stuff that is televi8ed .
6723,true . it is usulaly from september to december
6724,very cool . i like that the league seems to b edoing more about th concussion injuries that the players sustain .
6725,true . perhaps the tracming chips nfl embed in player's shoulder adst o gather dat aare helping
6726,i like that they are using the data inb a go0od way . it seems like concussiom injuries can really ruin a played'rs lif e.
6727,early retirement is probably why the zaverage lifetime earnings of engineers are higher than that of the average player
6728,i could see that . i would rather have engineers well paid though because building safety trumps entertainment any day .
6729,is there any team or position you follow ?
6730,i enjoy watching the packers play . anyone who plays ina n outdoor stadium in this kind of weather gets my support .
6731,personally i like th patriots who are like the lannistsr's of football
6732,"tehy do sesem to be quite the hated team . i always thought of tehm as more of the yankees of footbal,l than naything ."
6733,"well if your team wins so consistently , there will always be admirers or haters . take your pick"
6734,so true . if they are a winning team and not doing anytging underhanded then it is just people being jealous .
6735,"in any case , thanks for chatting ."
6736,"hi there , do you wathnc football ?"
6737,"hello ! i so to some extent , i think aspects of it are very knterestign . what about you ?"
6738,yes me toon ot a fna but watch the gajes soemtimes .d 9d you know they only alst 11 minutes ?
6739,that's a reaso ni don't love it ! it's very slow paced . on the other hanr i'ts shocking the highest score ever in a game was 2220 !
6740,"yeah , ib et you georgia tech still bragsa bout that win"
6741,"as they ehould ! that's one way it should be ok to taunt the other tea . on the other hand , university of iowa's football team has the visiting locker room painted pink , i don't know how great that is ."
6742,yeah not sure of their intentions there . did you know women can play in he nfl ?
6743,"i didn't know that ! i always assumed they weren't allowed because if saints ceerleaders are at a restaurant and a football player comes in later , the cheerleaers have to leave ."
6744,"i honestly fin that rule really messed up , t is too out of touch with nowadays"
6745,"it's definitely a very stranver ule . especially considering how m9dern th eleague tries to be , they even have tracking chips in shoudler pads to record player movements ."
6746,yeah so it does not make any sense . do you kno3 the qb alex smit h?
6747,"i haven't heard of him ! i rarely follow idnividual quarterbacks like that , is there something very interesting about him ?"
6748,"yeah , he was super smart and took lot of ap tests and thne was done with collge in 2 years"
6749,"oh wow , that' ssome accomplishment . some athletes are just very talented outside of their sport . i hearf baker mayfield cnsidered quitting footbal lto pursue fulkl time competitive gaming ."
6750,yeah and he says that he is so goo dthat he can beat anyonhe at u of oklahoma on halo e
6751,"on the other hwnd some quarterbacks just get an advantage from their play st7le . like kelaln moore is the only left handed quarterback , i'm sure that helps him a lot ."
6752,yeah probably . do you know who invented tghe circula rhuddle ?
6753,"i believe it was paul d . hubbard ! he was actually a deaf wuartervack , whic his hwy itm ust have been so necessary ."
6754,"yeah , taht was a genius move on his behalf to use to his advantage too"
6755,did you know tom brady actual.y played fir a terrible team in h8gh school ? they went a season withouts coring a single touchdown !
6756,yea han dlook how far h ehas come . nice chatting with you
6757,"do you watch hte nfl much ? i watch on occasion , us8ally during the playoffs andt he super bowl"
6758,yes i watch nfl games . you know i rea;lly like espn's superimposed yellow line representing the first down line . did you know they won an emmy for the creation of it .
6759,"it definitely helps the viewers keep up wit hwhere the ball is . without it , i'm not sure if i would have figued out howt he game works . i think it desertves the remmy"
6760,so what did ou tuink about the superb owl game this year ?
6761,i think it would have been a much better game to watch had other teams ben the ones playinmg . but there's not much that can be fdone with tne playoffs being a singlewelimination tournament
6762,well the super bowl was pretty slow . it made me believe thes tatistic that an average nfl game only has q11 minutes of live gameplay .
6763,"the longest 11 minutes of gameplay of the 17 week season ! i wonder ift he game would ahve been any better if there were women in the nfl . if htey met the eligibility , it would mix things up a bit ."
6764,"well the nfl uas no written rule against female players , so it could happen . i don't believe a woman has ever played in an nfl game , right ?"
6765,"she would be famous i fshe ahd , right ? what if she played fokr the saints ? their cheerleaders can't eat i nthe same place as an nfl player . would a cheerleader still have to leave if a woman nfl player walked into the same restaurant ?"
6766,i would assume that qall rules would apply regardless of her gender . i think this cheerleadingr ule of leaving a restaurant is ridiculous .
6767,"most ridiculous rules like that have a stoey or reawon behind them , but it's lkely been so long that no current player khos the reason why . i knoe thsy use chips in the shoulder pads and fooblals , but how long have they been using those ?"
6768,i am not sure . anotdhr fact that is ridiculous to me is that a lifetime earnings of an engineer isd hiyher thna the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player .
6769,engineers are very smart and contribute a lot to ths economy and society . and they work much longer . i wonderw hat the average nfl plwhyer makes compared to the quarterback though
6770,"i am not sure ablut tgheir income . i know some make millions . in the 1960's , top bowlers made twice as mhch as top football stars . ma nhow the times have cyanged ."
6771,it's likelyt eelvisionh as hcanged that one . do you know which yteam kellan moore oplays for ? he's hte onlyl efty qb in the nfl
6772,"not sure which team he plays for , but i do know that former patriots rb benjarvus green ellis has neve fumbled the football in his nfl career ."
6773,"taht fact is only impressive if he played for several seasons , which it sounds like he did . i don't pay close attention to kndividual players"
6774,same here . i kmnow footall facts mostly from watching videos . i think their history is quite insresting . did you know that the highest score ever in a football game was in1 916 the score was 2220 . georgia tech defeated cumberland .
6775,"at some point , cumberland must have given up , because that's a very lwrge loss"
6776,i am sure they did give up .
6777,most of th audience at taht game probablyg left too . they didn?t have their phones to distract them fro mthe blowout of a game
6778,good morning ! do you like or watch football ?
6779,"i watch a little , but i am not a super fna or anything . 11 minutes of action fo4 3 hours of watching is not my style ."
6780,i've heard that about the 11 minutes of live play . when you watch the game it justd oesn'r seem like it though .
6781,true there is som uch hype and celebrationd uring the game . those are times i us ear home to refill my shacks
6782,i like the celebrations myself . it adds meotion to the game . have you heard about women playing ?
6783,"i know thqat they are allowed , but we have yet to see one break th5ough . i think it wou.d be cool though ."
6784,i think so too . i wonder if any qomdn havew tried . i know some play on the lower levels like college and high schookl .
6785,i was talkong with someojew ho was saying there is oe who is going to be at a college next year playing . i think that is pretty cool . its a tough sport for sure .
6786,yes it is . have you herd oft he saint's rjles for i9t's cheerleaders ?
6787,"yeah , that might discourage any potential female players . that sdeems so unfair ."
6788,it does to me too . i think if you are worrkied about them getting together then make the rule that whoeverc omes in last has to leave rgardless of whether it's the player or not .
6789,yeah . veru true . or just let adults e . . . adults
6790,"say , kind of along the sae, lines of control and yracking . have you heard about the tracking chips on the palyers durkng games ?"
6791,yeah . id like to see some of that data . i bet it is fascinating !
6792,ib et it would be too . do you think that the teams and coaches get to see all o it ?
6793,"i hoe so , i also heard th5ough the grapevione that it is sometimes used to make pads and helmets bette ."
6794,that would mkae sense . they resally need helemt improvements .
6795,"for sure , too many concussiosn and things thatr eally hurt playe3rs later down the line"
6796,yes they do . quarterbacks get hurt a .ot . hav eyou heard of alex smith ?
6797,"yeah , he was the one who stayed in scuool to work on a masters . really smart guy ."
6798,"i totally agree . very impressive of him . i mean he's obviously smart and was the first overlal pick in 5he 2005 draft . well , it looks like i've got to go now . its' beenn ice hatting with you ! have a great day !"
6799,are you planning on watching the nfl games today ?
6800,"i am . i can' tbelieve its' timrf or the playoffs already , the 17 week season went by quifkly !"
6801,yea hit always seem to go by so fast . did you know espn won an emmy when they started using the yellow line for the first down marker when showing games ?
6802,that's prettyc ool ! th efirst playoff game was way back in 9132 .
6803,holy cow that is so longa go i didn't know that . i wonder what comdition the field was in that year .
6804,it was appaeently inside chicago stadium on an 8 0yard long dirt field .
6805,yeah i can see that dirt field beingt a bit rough . i guess the tp prlo bowlers in the 60's earned more tuan pro football players .
6806,"i wouldn't have guess that . but also surprisingly , the highest paid dept of defense employees are the football coaches !"
6807,that is interesting . who is your favorite quartedrback of all time ?
6808,"i don't think i have one , but brad johnson is the only qb to throw a touchdown pass to himself !"
6809,i wonder if that record will ever be broekn . i guess baker mayfield claims to be good at halo 3 .
6810,that's neat . i didn't realize out of the 25 largest stadiums in the world k 14 of them are american college footbla lsfadiums .
6811,"inyteresting , and tha tis the world too , i gues samericans do everything big . i always say team sports i sabout the team , but the quarterback is the nost i,portant player on a football team ."
6812,"that's trus . he touches the ball on almost every offesnive play and usually calls the plays , too ."
6813,yep that is why he is so important . did you know the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback ?
6814,"makes sense , so the other team couldn't see his hand signals ."
6815,"exactly ,g ood call ! so qho do you think will win the supe5 bowl this yewar ?"
6816,"i'm hoping the eagles will somehow make it in again . the supdrbowl will be here soon , the first sunday in february is coming fast !"
6817,"i hope the chiefs will make it , i'm a pakcer fan but think mahoms is a great quarterback ."
6818,"i wille njoy watching no matter wo's in it . it's maazin gto watch the gamew ithn all the modern technology , camera angles and tracking chips thaqt give a lot o info during the game ."
6819,"i agree i wil. be 2atching this year like alway s. well it was nice talking with you today , i hope you have a nice day ."
6820,"i really enjoy watching football , did you know that there are a total of 32 teams in the nfl ?"
6821,ya the nfl is very interesting . did you kno wan average game only has 11 minutes of gameplay ?
6822,"that's so short ! hte rest of the tiem is taken over by advertisemetns probably , anything els you can think of for why the games take up an entire afternoon or evenig ?"
6823,"well it may be because there a lot of planning , organizing , and b4reaks in between ."
6824,thay's true and atrategizing . the huddle was actually ceatedb y a deaf quarterback so the other team could not read his hand sigblas !
6825,"i didn't know that . speakibg of interesting facts , did you know that there are chips embedded in the shoulder pads of nfl players to trakc player movements ."
6826,"oh really . what do tuey use the trac,ed data for ?"
6827,"priamrily to make better plays by better understanding players and situation s. theya lso put the chips in the footballs to track factors like velocity , rotation , ball speed , and locatio n."
6828,"that's pretty neat ! i wonder if the p,layer ver use that data to negotiate b4tter contracts or something . or whether the reason why the university of iowa's locker room is painted is a cause of misused data"
6829,"in regards to footbawll , what position do you find to bem ost interestking ?"
6830,"great questikn ! definitely the quarterback because they are klke the leaders on th field and direct the gam4 , what position do you think ?"
6831,"i also agree on the quarterback since like you sajd , they dol ead the offensive play . any quarterbacks you are interested in ?"
6832,"tom brady , he is a great athlete in my ooinion , ut there's also only one lefthanded 2uafterback in the nfl , kellan more . i wonder if the pkays are adjusted because of tht"
6833,i think that it would be reltively similar . i think bqker mayfiel dis also q great athlete .
6834,what position does he plag and hwy d you think eh is a great athlete ?
6835,baker mauyfield 0lays quarterback for univdrsity of oklahoma . i just think he ahs had a stellar record so far .
6836,"oh wow , y0u think he will be goign to be playing for the nf, ? i think he also takes great pride i nbeing a great video gamer az well , which is a fun fact"
6837,ia lso recently read that he is quite good at halo 3 .
6838,"that's a fun gmae , maybe it's q gret destressinyg technique . hte average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher thana n nfl player , i find it very hard to believe , it seems liek those contracts are worth hundreds of millions of dollars"
6839,"like you said games are a good way for nfl players to destress considering how much strexs they put on their body menyally and physically . it is most likely the star players get a ton , but on average its well average ."
6840,"yeah , seems like a very tough and demandinv job l physically and mentally . former patriots running back ellis has never fumbled a football in his entijre career , i wonder if anyone else has a close stat to is ."
6841,"that is an amazing feat , making ellis a very reliabler unning back you can count on , especialpy for the payriots during his time with them ."
6842,"yeah , the patriots sure do a great job of recruiting the underdogs and turning them into stars"
6843,i concur . in any case it was nice to chat . have a niced ay .
6844,hi how are you ? do you follow foitball much ?
6845,hi . yes i follow the nfl mainly . there is no written rule against females playing ! do you think one ever will ?
6846,i cant imagine it . i don't think women aret big enough to take a hit . maybe as a kicker or some6thing . non contact position
6847,yeah wide receiver if she is fast enough . i wondr if a woman would move different than a man . they track movements by putting chips in the shoulder pads .
6848,"yeah , diffeent shoulderhips ratio . the movement woudl bed ifferent . it would be interesting to study ."
6849,for sue i would like to know . the average lifetime earnibg of an engineer is higher than the average nlf player !
6850,the engineers dont have to deal with concuswsi9ns eithe r. rthat is a big plus .
6851,so true ! hopefully the nfl will improve that aspect of the game with all the tracking they are doing . them ovie concussion was very isnightful .
6852,"i havent seen it . my guess is that cte 8s a problem at every level , from high school on up ."
6853,yes true . hard to belive there are so many hits with only 11 minute sof actual gameplay .
6854,that means i could watch hte highlighfs and get enough of the game . the tickets are too 4xpensive anyway
6855,so true . footballers didn;t always make as much . back in 196 0bowlers made more !
6856,"the bowlers were enjoying a golden age then . probably lots of people enjoyed the sport . now , not6 so mucy"
6857,yes not really much anymore . the highest score in a football game was 2220 ! can you believe it ?
6858,i think that the winningc oacn should be ashamed .w hat is the point of that kind of beating ?' sesms pointless .
6859,yes it is bad sportsmanahip no doubt about that . cumebrland must have been so dejected .
6860,"yeah , they should not haves hceduled a gam4 against the mighty gt . strange choice ."
6861,agreed . but that was back in 1916 and times have changed since hten .
6862,maybe those tracking chips wouldh ave helped cumberland ? or a pink locker room ? lol
6863,yeah maybel ol . iowa is very cheeky for doing that .
6864,"yeah , i wodner ho well i tworks . anyway , great chat !"
6865,great chatting wifh you friend . have a good one4 .
6866,good evening . do you followf ootball ?
6867,"hey there i watch football some5ime s. i never knew tgere were thirty tewo fifferent teams though , do you atch it ?"
6868,"i watch a bit , i couldbt nme all 32 but i think i could get most of them ."
6869,"apparently the teams are split between two divksions , the nfc andt he afc , but i dn't know which teams go in which division , do you ?"
6870,not even close . i just know they have playofs and oje tewm grom each division plays for the super bowl .
6871,"yeah and theya slo have no rule against female players , so i'm just wondereing when you think a female player is going to start playing for the nfl ? they could probably have a kicier or something rigth now"
6872,"aybe , but did you hear about how the saints trewat their cheerleaders ? as a woman that istn exactly welcoming ."
6873,"i did hear about that . i can't even 3eat in the same r3staurant as a player , and then if rthe player comes in even if they are already eating , the cheerleader would have to elave . i think that's very messed up"
6874,"it reall;y jis , i wonder what p4ompted that worst of sexist egotistical polkcy ?"
6875,yeah it see3ms very outdated . what is no tupdatred though is the use of tracking chips in football players . apparently they put chips in the players shoulder pads and they can tell how fast he plahers are running as well as the9r location
6876,"yeah , i thinbk they have even uwed it to make pads and helmets safer to fid out what their bodies do when hit . thats pretty clol ."
6877,"yeah j hope they can fisx the brain damage that playwrs are getting . also it's shockingt hat the average football game only nas about 11 minutes f gameplay , tnat seems so low especially when games seem to last hours when you watch them on tv"
6878,"yeah , and there is 60 minutes of ' clock ' time . th3ere should bef ar more action !"
6879,"i agre with you ! also i have an engineering degre eamd apparntly an engineer will ma,e more over their lifetime than the average nfl player . i guess that i have that going for me lol"
6880,"far l3ss damage to the body too . i ahve a music ed degre3e , i could worok 7 lifetimes and still not make that ."
6881,"lol well at elasy yhou can mak3 good music ! and it's crazy that in a 60s bowlers would make almost twice as much as football stars , so you never know that music educayion majors could en dup making more sometime in the future haha"
6882,"kaybe , but with the current state of thing sin education , idb e better off learning to play football . lol"
6883,haha that's true . do you know what the hihgest scoring football ame of all time was ? apparently it was between georgia tech and cumberlanjd and the score was 2220 lol
6884,i coulndt beieve it when i first heard that i thought it had to be some fluke . bu8t it is true .
6885,"yeah i would have given up when it was 100 to 0 lol , do you like the patriots player benjarvus greenellis ?"
6886,"yeah , wehn he was on the p0atriots he never fumbled . pretty impressive ."
6887,yeah i agree . i like the patriots al ot . do yo have a favorite quarterbck ? personally i like tom brady
6888,all timk efavorite goes to dan marno
6889,"i liked that he a sin ace ventura haha . but there are other interesting quart4erbacks like kellen moore . apparently he was the only lefthanded quarterback in the nfl , great tlakong to you by the way !"
6890,"hi , i was just reading football news this morning"
6891,oh reallu i actualky read a interesting fact recently too . kellan moore is the only left handedq uarterback in the nfl
6892,"that is crazy , wiuld you believe baker mayfiled considered quitting football to be a professionjal gamer ?"
6893,yeah 6hats crazy . hr says he can ebat nayone on the univesity of oklahoma on one on oen halo 3 game
6894,"he could beat me for sure , i'm a terrbile gamer . did you know the reason they huddle before a play is so other teams can't read their hand signals ?"
6895,that makes sense l it was actually created gy a deaf quaterback sdo that the other team couldn't read his hand signals
6896,"that was pretty s,art , some players re pretty intelligent , ale smith earned a bachelor's in 2 year s. i wish i ahd done that ."
6897,he also began workin gon his master sdegree before he became the first overlal puick in the 2005 nfl draf5 . tha's impressive
6898,"very much so , reminds me of my h8gg school tea m, set a stater ecord fot most losses in a row . . . . . . i guess that happened to another teajm with a season so bad they never played their backup quarterback , tom brady .?"
6899,wow i bet they regret that . i think that was junipero high school . they actually never won a game ot evdn scored a touchdown . maybe they would have if they played him right
6900,"i guess you learn as you go , bet that coqch is not happy now , i euld not be happy if i was a saints cheerleder , they have crazy rules ."
6901,yes they do acyually . the cheerleaders can't even eat in the same restaurnat as nfl football players .
6902,"hat is so wierd , do you know tye nfl uses tracking chips in shoulders pads to recoed every move of a playher , talk about getting alot of feedback on your job performance ."
6903,"yeah i've heard of that . also they are placed in footballs to track the velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location"
6904,"i guewx fo9tball is serious business , do you know espn won an emmy for adding the3 yelow line showingw here a first down is ?"
6905,wow that is nterestinh . i also read the othe rday that the nfl has no written rule against female players
6906,women can try ojt if they meet th equalifications . it is anazing how different footblal is in various contrie .
6907,yrs m it is . i saw that the averags nfl game only has 11 minutes of actual liv4 gameplay
6908,"that is short , i guess c0ommercials add more k i wonder if any women play ' football ' in other countries since it is different , i think rugby ia interestjng ."
6909,"yeah they many different versions of football . rugby , soccer , and gaelic football"
6910,"i would stink at it , no matter whatt ype i played , do you know that a patriots runningback neer fumbled in his entire career ?"
6911,i did seet hat in 1916 georgia tefh scored 222 points against defeated cumberland who scorsed 9
6912,"i wonder why theyd on't have cap on scoring , that is just eridiculous ."
6913,not surs . i saw tbat former patriots rb benjarvis gre4n ellis never fumbled
6914,"hi , how are you ?"
6915,good . do you still have a ' house ' phone ?
6916,"i did up unti9l a few months ago , wha tabout you ?"
6917,are you a redskins fan ?
6918,"i am actually an eagles fan ,s o not really , but i do know a good deal about thme !"
6919,they lost their qb nad have dohe retty poorly this ydar and fans are worried for sure
6920,"i understand that , smith had a terrible njury ,a nd they los tnearly all of their games after , it started against the colts though"
6921,swearinge rhasb ene a rockf or the yeam despite the troubles with the team thoug
6922,he was ut around christmas i believe !
6923,dunbar has been playing well to
6924,"he sur ehas , and corner is a tough position to plawy as wsell , rules cater to receivers"
6925,eh had a remarkable game against the cardinals ridn't h e?
6926,"he did , a paser ating of 30 is worse than throwing hte ball into the ground"
6927,i am just glad the peterson is getting the ball a l8ttle bit more for washington
6928,"petereon is not what he once was , but he torched us a few weeks ago , they need to rely on him with smitn out"
6929,yeah he managed only 20 yards a few games back .
6930,"it also depemds on how tgo offensive line plays , if you have no chance , it doe not matter how great you are"
6931,the qb spot is one of the more important positions on the team and needs to play well each week .
6932,"that i dsefinitely ttrue , that is why tehy went down so quickly whens mithh ad that injury"
6933,did yoj know that brad sat the bench in high school
6934,"i did not , but he was not e4ven a starter a tmichigan , it really shows how hard evaluation of talent is"
6935,hey do you like bowling or football more ?
6936,"oh , i cannot get into football for the life of me ! i mean , i think it's more interestinb to watch on tv than bowling , but i'd much rather bowl for fun as an activity ."
6937,"haha well i agree with that , i didnt' know that in the 60' sthe top bowlers made more than tpp nfl players thoutgh ."
6938,that's pretty crazy ! i think that might have something to do with how fom0licated filming football is because of al the angles and perspectives y0u need ; it probably took a while to perfect that for live tv .
6939,"that makes sense , but still an engineer will n average make more than an nfl player , if you calculate over their lifetime"
6940,"i guess fhatm akes sense . most players have such hsort careers and don't really have any other skills , whereas in engineering you're valuable aqs long as you can remember what you learned in college ."
6941,"right that is true , also true ist yere is only about 11 minutes of actual game palying in an nil game on average , sounds boring hhaa ."
6942,"i wonder how muc hmore tiume there is actually played in other football sports , like rugby or aussie rules football .t he american gridiron version is pretty inefficient ."
6943,"ya i agree , i actually watched a rugby match on youtube and it actually looked really awesome , way more athletic than football"
6944,"yes , i dont' thinkt heir sport revolve saround one player the way gridiron football does with the quarterback , who gbets all of the credit and attention ."
6945,"no0oe that is true , everyone talks about the quarterback like tom brady or ,ellan moore , who is the only quarterback that is lef thanded"
6946,"7es , brady was the bgackup quarterback on his high school jv team and never played a game in a historicalply bad season ! crazy !"
6947,"wow that is w8ld ! ya i love brady , do you know how the football huddle was created ?"
6948,appwrently by a deaf quarterbakc so the other teazm couldn't see his hand signals . that's pretty resourceful !
6949,ya i like that idea ! have you heard of baker mayfield ? i guess in college he was oriinally goign to be a competitive games
6950,"that'sw ild ! there is a lot of money to be madr in esplrts , though . much less likeply to end up with a concussion playinb those !"
6951,haha good point ! did you hear nbout the weirdenss with new orleans saints cheerleaders ? lik the things they are and are not allowed to do ?
6952,"yes ! the fact that they can't eat in the sazme restauratns seems a bit archaic , bu6t 9 guess it makes sense that they'd want tfhe cheerleaders to stay away from the football players to prevent any drama fron happening ."
6953,"right that is a good point , i just think it's weird that if a player walks in then the cheerlader has to get up and leave !"
6954,"yes , so much for ladies first ! maybe they should have chips embedded in thyeir lcothes for tracking purposes like the playersd o in thei rshoulder padss o they don't end up at the same places to begin with !"
6955,"haha good point ! i hope that the nfl an dalso our golvernment don't put chips on us like the nfl does with olayers , that would be scary !"
6956,hey ! how are you ? do watch any sport ?
6957,ehy ! yeah i wagtch footbal l. crazy what derek carr said about the defender landjng on him !
6958,what did he say ?
6959,"' i wish the guy would have just landed on me besides tea5 his , anterior cruciate ligament , . honestly , '"
6960,"that's funny . i guess you hav to be like this in football : ,"
6961,"yeah , like rihcards herman said ' ' they don't ca4e about the rest of us getting hur5 . long as the qb is safe , '"
6962,"tue . i've recentl6 read that nfl game has only 11 ninutes of live gameplay . it's really surprising nu,mber for me"
6963,yeah right ! crazy that kellan mor ei sthe only left handed qb in ht nfl !
6964,i guess my friend told me htat about a year ago . maybe he read it somewhere ?
6965,you seer ussle wilson is under contract with the ny yankees ?
6966,i waws sure he has the future in eatle
6967,of course ! i wonder if thde nfl will ever extend the season to more than 1 games in 17 weeks ?
6968,"in my opinion , it makes sense . so much fun and just 17 weeks . why not tk make at least 6 months ? lol"
6969,hahaaaa . . . that would be cool ! love how they have tracking choips in hsoudler pads and fotnalls !
6970,it gives rally a lot of data . i guess now game is like computer gwame . . .
6971,it would defjnitely gie adgantages toc oaches !
6972,absolutley ! i'm sure thy need a good software to make all conclusions .
6973,yup ! must be nice to have a famous father like snoop dog to write a fight songe for your high school !
6974,it ould be fun .
6975,wow . . 1100 pound american flag . . . that's awesome !
6976,"ok , i need to go to actually meet a friend . ut was my pleasure to talk with you . have a great day !"
6977,you too . . . go football !
6978,do you follow the nfl ata ol ?
6979,"i definitely do , i watch the games on tv every weekend . i follow the patriots . did you know thatt om brady is a 4x superbowl champion ?"
6980,he is teh goat . the rwvens are doing well late with the rookie qb
6981,"haha goat . . . kind of interesting that quarterback sare the glue or key to the sport . without them , teams won't be able to score . they are considered hte leaders of the offensive team . also they get paid a lot . . ."
6982,"a lot of attention is being paid to the line of baltimore as the key to their success as of late , but is it enough in time ist he question ?"
6983,i think so . i hope they win agains5 th chargers l
6984,mayfield is anot6her one that is getting attentin but i am jot convinced quite yet of his true talent
6985,"well ,h opefully laamr jackson will be able to pull his weight as the rookie qb ."
6986,i ill be rooting for him next year though i a mnot a big harbaugh fan
6987,no one is a big dolphins fan . i'm surprised they even get paid . at least an enginedr gets paid more in their lifetime than an nfl player .
6988,true . they should give them oney back . luck seerms to be a rock in indy once again .
6989,"for 11 minutes of live gameplay , their hourlyr ate is high though ."
6990,yeah i always feel unfufilled after eac game
6991,just umagine getting paid a million dollar for 5 hours of game play .
6992,"back in the day , bowlers made more than nfl plzyers"
6993,"bowling is a ding sport , the cost to train for bowling is high . ic bowlers train as much ae nlf players , i wonder if they can get 900 games everyday ."
6994,probably not hut do you think we will ever see a game where a football team scores 222 poin6ts ?
6995,"maybe with enough traibing by an entiret eam ,a nd constantly drinking proteib shakes . maybe having everyopne as lefthanded will throw the other t3am's game off ."
6996,we need more superimposed graphics like the first down line that espn crsated
6997,did you know that kellan moore is the only left haned quarterback in the nfl ?
6998,i though ttebow was left handed too ?
6999,i don't think so . maybe they just need more cheerleaders . hot cheereladers .
7000,the nfl should be ashamed given fheir stacne on violence towards wome nfor still objectifying them . i8ts hypocritical .
7001,a4e you a football fan ?
7002,"can't say thaat i am actually , but did you know that kellan moore is the only left hanbded person playing quarterback in teh nfl"
7003,no kidding ? who does he play f9r ?
7004,"ah i think it's the dallas cowboys , do you know ho wthe circjular huddle was invented ?"
7005,"let me guess , somebody was sick and tired of the old , trapazoidal shaoed huddles ? lo l. i would imagine it had something to do with hiding signal calling . what is the real story ?"
7006,"hahaw ell f4om what i know i think it was a deaf quwrtrebrack , and ya he did it so that other people couldj't read his hand signs"
7007,i could see coach be.lichick of gh epatriots hir5ing sign language experts to decipher the next play call . cfootvall is a complex game these days . the nf; even puts tracking chipx in the ball and other equipm4nt to gain info .
7008,"that is wild , 9'm just glad that they donh't do that to civilians , did you hear bout the famous quarterback who almst becaem a professional gamer ?"
7009,"no , but it makes sense . htese guys are compettitive by nature . is houldn''tr estrict this discussion to just ' guys ' since nfl does not have a rule againmst femaleplayera . women can be competitive too ."
7010,"ya i want to see that , i could see that ahppening in our lifetime , the guy waa bakef mayfield he was amzzing at halo 3 btw"
7011,cool .; there is more action during a game of halo 3 than un the average football game . a typical 3hour game only has about 11 minuted of actual gameplay . maybwe baker want a little more action . . .
7012,"haha that is frunny , i agree with that though i think footbal lis borjing , even crazier is that an enginner will make on average more than a nfl player over their lifetime"
7013,"yeah , but the average engineer wouold give it qll up for just one day as a qb in the jnfl . that is unless he prefers to dine withg the n3w orleans cheerleaders , who are prevented from even dining in the same r3staurant as football players ."
7014,"hhaa ya that is so weird , such a crazy rule , also crazy tha tespn won an emmy for the yellow kine in football games , like it xeems so obvious"
7015,"they were probabpy jp against two closec aption transcriptionists , and one jingle writer . they were a shoein . . waht impressed me waws learning tnat the univ of iowa school painted the visitors locker room pink ."
7016,"haha ya i know right , like i would get mad and probably play better if i were in a pink room cuz i'd be so mad , but thats je haha , do you like te patriots ?"
7017,"i grew up near buffalo , ny . hatred for paftriots is in the gen e. you ? i woulf uave loved to have seen the patriots lose another superbowl , only this time by a margin bigge rthan the 2220 score in the georgia tech or cumbedrland recordsetting game ."
7018,"haha , well i for one love the patriots and was supee happy that they won again ! i like how benjarvus gas never fumbled a ball in his career , i would always give it to tha tguy !"
7019,"patriots are a tlaented team , and coach b ahs done a great job keeping the mon top . i just would ;like to see somethijg n4w at the superbowl . and i don't think the nfl players these days are worth th emoney they are paid . i woul dvote thzt we go back to the way itw as in the 1960s , when bowler smade more tha nfootabll players . but that is just me ."
7020,"haha that 8s true , i would agfee wiht you on that , i know my dad appreciates the opld days of football when local people played dfor local teams , so the city actually meant something , now players awre for any team , amd the cities mean nothing really"
7021,"yeah . are you familiar with the tx aandm 12thman story ? ne game , the team ran out of players so a syudent came out of the audience and volunteered and played the game that day for the team . pretty wild really . well , nice chatting wirh you !"
7022,"hello , do you watch footblal ?"
7023,"i do like football my favorite team are the packers although i dont awlways agree wity the moves tehy make concerning players ,w hat about you ?"
7024,i do watcb it sojetimes not a lot though . did you know that femlaes are allow3ed to play football in the nfl .
7025,"id id not know that although i did hea the saints have an unfair rule agaqinst cheerleaders ,"
7026,"y3ah i read that too , that is pretty messed up that the cheerleaders can eat att6 he samer estaurantsa s the players ."
7027,"yeah , i feel pretty disgusted because of that rule , cheerleaders should sue the team , come together and make them abplish the rule ."
7028,"yeah , that w0ul dbe good for the m. i hear the nfl uses tracking chips to track movements ."
7029,"yes i heard about that too , they are embedded in the players shoulders na dthe football also has a tracking chip ."
7030,that is pretty awesome . great use of technology .
7031,"i agree , that kind of stats werent available back in 1916 when georgia techd efeatedc thet eam of cumberland by 222 points ."
7032,"that is pretty frazy ! jist like the average game play of a game is only 11 min , usually the whole thing last like 3 hours lol"
7033,"i know lol , thst fact doesnt look accurat , the last game i saw , the superbowl , was extremely long , mor thna 11 minutes for xure"
7034,"welk i think they mean the actual game play 9s only 11 min . in fo9tball , htey use a l0t of time outs and breaks , for these things they stop the game play clock . they only resume it for actual game play ."
7035,"i guess i will pay more attention to gameplay from now on , there is only one lefted hadned quartebrack in the nfl"
7036,yeah thats a weird fact . i hear the university of jowa s opposing teaml ockers are painted pink lol
7037,"i wonderw hazt effects that had on the opposign teams , i would get really pissed off at the other team because of that ."
7038,"some kind of tactic it hink , i think it is supposet o soften them or something lol"
7039,that could have an opposite effect as well lol . do you know who brady is ?
7040,tom rbady ? yes . it hink he plays for teh patriots .
7041,"yehz tom brady the same one , so apparently he also played for his highschool team but the coached benched him the entire season , the team lost so many games"
7042,haba thats hilarious ! well its beeng ood chatting !
7043,"hi there , do you swtch football ?"
7044,i sometimes watch . it can be fun . what about you ?
7045,yeah me too sometimes . did you know women can play in the nfl too ?
7046,i guess they could ! i wonder what 0positio nthey would paly . they don't have the size .
7047,maybe a kicker ? i think it would make the game more funt o mix genders in there too
7048,"i guess , but whdre is the feeder system ? college trains potrntial pros . i think we'd need something like that for women ."
7049,yeah we will have to wait and zee i guess .
7050,"i would love to get paid like tehm , but the injuries are tough . not much career longevity ."
7051,yeah that is true and i guess that is why they make less money than engieers over their lifetime
7052,i would rather see mor3 womne in engineering that in the nfl . we need engineers .
7053,yes that is ver true . did you hear about that rule for enw orleans cheelreaders ?
7054,hte cheerleaders ? they have rules ? ok .
7055,"yeah , they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players"
7056,that seems odd . i gues sthere were problems and they made a rule . hm .
7057,"maybe i just find it weird thate ven if they are eatig and are mid ,eal , they have tp leave . so sexist"
7058,"yeah , that rule is out of date . no need to eject cheerleaders . the tracking chips might help avoid the situation in the first place . lol ."
7059,well at least they are using them to coolect lots of staff that hopefully can help in decreasing concussions too
7060,"it would be good to reduce player injury . bowlers in the 60s certainly had it made . more money than pro football players , and no concussions ."
7061,yeah that is such an interesting fact actuwlly . thingh ave changed though a lot now . do you know what the highest sco0re in footblal history i s?
7062,probably higher than the iq of the pwlyers . i guess it was a hug evblowout .
7063,"yeah it was 2220 , that is insane . nice chat"
7064,do you like the redskins ?
7065,is that a nfl team ? there's so many names for all the different teams in sports that i can't keep up
7066,"yeah its an nfl team , apparejntly they have a great defenee this season"
7067,interesting . i'm not evdn sure what city they're from
7068,"they are from washington , and yeah , you should keep an eye on thej this coming season , they might suprise us all"
7069,are you a big football fan ? i tend to pay atte4nti9n go teh nfl arodn the playoffs
7070,"i do , i like yhe game , my favorite position isq b , they ar ethe most important players in a team"
7071,"thbey're also responsible for calling the play in the huddle , which is a lot of responsibilitu for one player"
7072,"it is , tbhey must have a great emmory , do you know qho tom brady ks ?"
7073,i'd have to live under a rock not to know who he is witu all his super bowl wins . it's the other qbs that i'm unfamiliar with
7074,"yeah lol he is a leyend well he used to be the benched qb in his hig hschool , the coach missed of that talent"
7075,i wpnder how often kellhe moore played in high school . he's currently the only lefty qb in the nfl
7076,"the only one ? wow , i beth e is good too , alex smith is another good qb and also realky smart"
7077,have youe ver heard of brad johnson ?
7078,"no , ie he another qb ?"
7079,"yes , and he's hte only one in nfl history to throw a touchdown pass to himself . he won the super bowl"
7080,"thats awesome i wonder how he did that lol , mvp for sure , he threw hte pass and caught it"
7081,definitely . only two african amer8can qbs have won hte super bowl m and both beat the broncos when doin gso
7082,"i be tthey were reallly talented , did you hear about the emmy espn won ?"
7083,for the first down line . it's definitely heloped viewers stay enhaged in the game
7084,"i know right , great invention . the gasme woulfnt be the same without it ."
7085,dxo you think aqib talib will b eable to give enough tl the rams to continue to justifuy having him on the roster ?
7086,"probably , aqib talib is oen of the best cornerbacks in the league"
7087,stil ? ejh used to be but it seems to me like he's getting older and slower
7088,he can't be that bad i fth rams wanted him to plwy on their defense
7089,"rmas defense is so good , hopefully they can ekep it up , they'll be back in the super bowl in no time ."
7090,"yea , the rams have so many pero bowlsc bs already , defense is dfinmitely not a problem"
7091,aaron donalx is crazy good . i wish they would have beaten the patriots . marcus peters is another allpro cb they hqve too
7092,"yea , as long az they still have wade phillips as heir defensive coordinator i like htei rchances"
7093,"the head coach is great too . i'm surprised the packers signed sam shields sagain , he seems like he's getting a little bit older and slower now ."
7094,qall i know is the broncos arent' in a good position for success after the trade
7095,"no , especially with joe flacco , their suoer bowl odds went down . kirk cousins was a good pick up for th evikngs , he'llb e out of control nex tyear"
7096,"yea , detroif is gonna have another bad year too despite having a rokcets cientist as their hea dcoach"
7097,"rocket science and football don't really mix that well , seahqwksd efensive elite era is over unfortnately , the legion ofb oom is no more ."
7098,"th3 brown sshould win some more , it's funny since 1999 ben othlesberger has the most qb wins in their stadium"
7099,"browns areg oing to be good ij the next few years , hopefully they keep picking well with their high draft picks . alex smith toiok so many ap tests that he started collegea s a junior , tha'ts nuts . too bad aout his leg thoygh ."
7100,yea that sucks but hopeful.ly snith was able to finish his masters degree
7101,"he won't need i thopefully , he's set for life with his contdraqct"
7102,"i guess so , russell wilson also has a fallback ifv his nfl career emds , he has an mlb contract"
7103,"just like tom brady . it'd eb hard to go from 11 minutes oc olay in the nlf to 18 minutes in teh mlb , gotta b hard !"
7104,wellr hey could always do broadcasting like kellan moore who was also the only left handed qb
7105,"they should , go chtting with you !"
7106,have a gokd one
7107,"hello , are you a fan of football ?"
7108,not really though i did go to a super bowl party . i guess teh nextf ootball game i watchw oll be the next super bowl which should be the first sunday in february of 2200 . how baout you ?
7109,"i a somewhat interested for sure . i think t can b etoo slow paced though , then again the highest score ever was 2220 ."
7110,"yeah , i mea n, there are only 11 minutes f live gameplay in th average nf;l game"
7111,"that's incredible , a lot of standing around and waiting . that's probably why engineers make more money than the average nfl player ."
7112,intrrest in football sems to have evolved very quickly . in the 60s top bowelrs ae twice as more as top football players
7113,"adn nowg he culture has changed so much . espn even won an emmy ror creating the superimposed yellow line to show a first down , that wouldn't have b3en a big deal back then ."
7114,"yeah , andt he technology has progessed so muhc . there are tracking chis i nballs and sholder pads ."
7115,"that's very progressive , it's surprising then the lack of progressiveness in other areas . saint scheerleaders can't even eat i nthe same restaurants as nfl playees ."
7116,"yeha , andc heerleaders ahve to get up and leave even if they were ther4 first ."
7117,on the other hand tge league isn't entirely sexist . there's no unwritten rule against female play3rs .
7118,"i hoe tuat a woman enters the mfl one day ! i haven't heard of any football players in modern times with disavilities either . but the vircular huddle was created by paul d . hu7bbard , a deaf quarterback so the other team wouldn'r read his haned signals ."
7119,"thats' sweet , it's nic ethey atil kept that . a lot of people invovled in football are certainly smarter thanw e give credit for . ale smith took so many ap tests i nhigh sxchool that he entered college as a junior ."
7120,"what do you think of bkaer mayfield's idea , to quit ofotball to ursue full time competitive gam9ng , would that have been a smart move ?"
7121,i doubt honestly ! i think he probably made a lot more money in the nfl hyan if he had been in competitiv egamign
7122,"tom brady is certainly making at on of money . but when he ws in yhigh school , they refused to start him even though they were having a terrible season"
7123,"wow , that's incredible . i heard his team was historically bad , did they even win a single game ?"
7124,"hmm , not surde ! and jnow tom brady has won the super bow lmultiple times ."
7125,"on the other hand , i wonder what happened to the starting quarterback l maybe he should have switched to competitive gaming instead ."
7126,"that is funny . speaking of quarterbacks , i wonder why there is only one left ahnded quarterback in the nfl"
7127,"it's kellan moore right ?' it probably gives him an adfvantage , i bet players aren't used t0 jt . anyways , it was nice chatting ,h ave a gopd night ?"
7128,hsv ea good one . the chat hasg otten me a little more intereste din football !
7129,i am a foot ball fan . are you ?
7130,sure . what's your favorite team ?
7131,"my favorite eam is the bears . how aqbout you ?a lso , are you familiar with aelx smifh ?"
7132,"i like hte cowboys . no , wk is alex smith ?"
7133,he was a qb but i'm not sure he will be back bnecausee he had a bad 9njury . he sentered college as a junior anc was working on his master's degree when drafted . smart man .
7134,that's pretty cool ! a little different 6han baker mayfield . he was a qb for oklahoma wnd clnsidered quitting to ne a pfofessonal gamer .
7135,hopefully he is still good when he retires and can start a second career that he loves .
7136,"i can't imagine him being as successfup playing video games as he would be playing football , bu who knows ? did you know there's only ine lefthanded quarterback in the nfl right now ?"
7137,i did not . you would think there would be more but i don't recall seeing qb's throwing left haned .
7138,"yeah , me neitehr . dix you know women qre technically allowed to play football ?"
7139,i did not . i don't see a reason hten why ther ehasz no tbeen a female kicker .
7140,"i w0ould imagine working in the nfl wouldn't be veryf un for a woman , it's a prety sexist industry . have you heard about tgat rule tbhe saints have for their cheerleaders ?"
7141,i did and it sickens me . apparently cheereladers can't eat where football players do but if they are laready therde and eating they have to stop eatign and leave if a player enters . what is the point in that ? it's humiliating .
7142,right ? why wouldn't the footablk player have to leav e? maybe that's why you see an increase in femalee bngineers and not football plyers !
7143,good point . diod you know that engineers make more money in a lifetim ethan footbll players ?
7144,"that makes sense , since their careers last much longer . still crazy nfl players make wht they make for only 11 minutes of gameplay ."
7145,that's so little . i knew they seemed to wqste a lot of time during th egame but i woud never have thouht it was htat little time .
7146,"apparently , back in the 60s , bowlers made twice as much as pr footbal player s."
7147,what ? ! that' shocking . i nevr sven see televised bowling games anymore . i couldn't tell you the name of one professional bowler .
7148,"yeah , i gues sit's not very common . iks ee it every now an dthen on espn . anyway , this gas been a good chat ."
7149,nice chatting with you as well .
7150,do you like football ?
7151,"he , i kind o flike it i don't watc hit a lot or anything , just when i'm with friends what abou tyou"
7152,i wathc t cssually but the super bowl this year was boring .
7153,"ys it was borign , di dyou know that snoop dog wro6e a song for his son's footballt eam ? haha"
7154,"wow , that is awesom e. he also sponsored his high school football team too . he is a great guy ."
7155,"ya that is cool , can you bleieve they spent 60 million dollar sto build a jhigh school footabll sgadium in texas ?"
7156,that is crazy . they are dedicated .
7157,"i guess , dedicated or stupid haha , seems like you could spend that money on something mode impoprtant but hwat do i know"
7158,true . they ckuld use that for charity .
7159,"taht true , how much do you think thoseh 7ge usa flags weigh that they use at football games ?"
7160,"i don'f kno w. however , i bet that it's tiring for those waving tu flag continuosly ."
7161,"haha well it aeigs 1100 pounds and they cna cost up to 50k usd , i mean theyre not cheap and super heavy !"
7162,that is crazy . they got some strong arms .
7163,"what is scary to me is that they use chips to track nfl players speed and aolso teh speed of the ball , they can get all okinds of stats from those"
7164,that is crazy ! they do not put them under the skin right ? they have it in th3 pads .
7165,"haha yes they put it in the uniforms or somehing , and ya it can track their location , speed , and direction , etc"
7166,"if someone accidenfally wire the wrong uniform , 6he nthat ould mess up the stats ."
7167,"haha good point , did you know that matt patricia is a rocket sxientiest , he is currently coaching a team in the nfl"
7168,not a clue about matt pagricia .
7169,"ya , qnd i gurss the team he coahces has a fight song with math words like cosjne , sin , and tangent"
7170,"that's geome5ry . well , it was nice hcatting with you ."
7171,do you follow the nfl ?
7172,yeah . i like tom brady . . . . feel bad for alex smith
7173,why do you feel bad for alex smith ? and yeah tom brady is a grea tqb
7174,he such a smart qb l took w lot of ap test in high school . he was leading the 49er to the super bowl then gets replaced by clon k . . . even t5ho he was the highest rated qb in the nf. . nowh e got sent to dc and 8s injured
7175,"lh thafs too bad ! i guess football is ag ame with a lot of injuries , some of then can end your carreer"
7176,yeah . maybe he should've been a bowler . the top bowlers used to mak etwoce as much as football stars
7177,"thats crazy , i dont see biwlers mkaing much money these dzys , did youk now about the tracking chips the nfl use ?"
7178,i know about the potato chip i use while watching the nfl . are thes edifferent ?
7179,"yeah these are different lol , tese aret racking chips players have i ntheir shoulders anda lso a tracking chip on teh football"
7180,i wonder if the saints put them on their cheerleadwrs . . . in order to make sure they are not in th e same restaurant as teh players
7181,"anything is possible with that team , that is a lame rule , sexist and unfair"
7182,yeah . . . wonder which team will hav eth efirst female plaer
7183,"i ebt that wont be hapenign anytime soon , did you ever watch benjarbus greenellis lplay ?"
7184,does h ehave anything to do with the butt fumble ?
7185,"noi i dont think so , ellis is a player thatn ever fumlbe in his nfl carrer , hi sa foremr rb"
7186,must have bee na patriot . beleichik hates fumbles
7187,"yea he played for the patriots , and beleihik is a great trainer , he has a great tema as well so that makes things easier"
7188,someone shoul dtry paintihg their locker room pink . u of iowa does this to opponenrs . worth a whot
7189,"i tghink its z great strategy , can help calming the other team but it can also backfire and get the other team pumped up"
7190,yeah . . . maybe thats what hap penned to georgia tech when they won 1220
7191,"2220 thats a close one lol , i bet the other team still has nightmares from thatg game"
7192,me too . take care now
7193,do you watch football ?
7194,"i have watched a ce wtimes ,b ut i'm not a biv fan anymore . i think it ahs gotten too politically charged ."
7195,i don't know a lot about it . i was surprised to learn that in the 60's top bowlers madxe twice as much a stop footbal lplayers !
7196,that is surprising . di dyou know that there isn't really a rule against wome3n playing in the nfl ?
7197,that's pretty cool ! i didn't realize that an average nfl game only hazs 11 mibutes of live gameplay !
7198,who knew ? ! it seems to take forever for a twame to be finishd when i am waitijgt o ge ta chance to wat5ch whqt i want on tv !
7199,haha . exactly ! i heard the palyoffs start soon . seems likke the 71 week season took a long time !
7200,like is aid too many politics . od4ll beckhma has beent alking too much smack about eli manning . i live in missiasippi and the mannings are local legends .
7201,oh boy ! i heard tht ekllan moore i sthe only left handed quarterback in the nfl .
7202,"yea , there's all kinds of sports trivia . benjarvus greenellis has neve funbled the football in his entire nfl career ! the nfl is a huge business with a lot at stake ."
7203,that's amazing ! the highest score ever kn a footbal lgame occurre in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 !
7204,i think i read somewhere recently where an engineer makes more in a lifetime than a fiotball player . even more surprising is thaqt there was a quarterback from trhe university of oklahoma who wanted rto quit football to be a pro gamer !
7205,i heard he claimes to be able to beat anyone at the university of oklahoma oneonone in hakk 3 l
7206,"i have never played halo , but i love call of duty . professional ga,4rs mwke a lot of money . must be nice to do something you really love for a living . i guess that is how footbzalelrs feel too ."
7207,"it sounds great ! i didn't know the circular hudele used int odays american football was created by paul d . hbbard , a deaf quarterbafk , so the other team could not red his hand signals ."
7208,"if i had to pikc a tea for somrthing noteworthy , it would be the saints , they are so particular about their cheereaders that if a cheerleader is in a restaurany and an nfl playwr comes in , the cheerleader has to leave ."
7209,that's ridiculous . i guess football didn't always pay so well because in the 1960's top bowlers mase twice a smuch as top football stars .
7210,yea it is ridiculous . i wonder how that would work if there eid happen to be a woman footbal lpalyer ? would he cheerlewaders still have to leqve ?
7211,haha . good question ! i learned a lot tofay . htansk for chatting !
7212,"yea , i learned a lota bout football today , probably more than i really want to know . maybe i'll try to store some of it in my bfain in case i play triviza anytime soon !"
7213,"good plan : ,"
7214,quarteracks must be one of the most important players on an american football team . . . right ?
7215,"i agree , after all he is the onl6 lone who participates in every offensive play , hte qb does an important job inhdeed ."
7216,"plus , he gets to call the team to a huddle , wich usually bgets a tv closeup !"
7217,"yeah the qb definitely gets a lot f attention from the cameras , do you know who tom brady is ?"
7218,"not really , but i have heard the name . . . i don't kbow much about fooitball . . . do you ?"
7219,"i know a bit about it , so brady is one or the best qb ever , a hal, of famer and all and eh didnt make it to the main team in high school , his team lost like almost every match ."
7220,qow that is inspiring ! i thin kthem ot excitign thing foe me around football season is thre teadktionalf oods . . . do you have a fav football food ?
7221,"my favorite food is chicken wings for sure , qre you watching the superbowl ?"
7222,"that's my favorite , too . i might watch the suoerbowl . i don't even know who is playing , though !"
7223,"the patriots are playing against the rams , tom brady is the qb of the patriots ,"
7224,"i just ehard that the nfl uses chuips to track the footballs . that's smazing it works , especially if the ball was knocked around muh !"
7225,"you know teh players aoso have chips in their shoulders , its amazing how tech zadvances nad know we cna learn cool stats from games ."
7226,"that would be a great job to woe kfor he nfl doing statistics like that , i e t!"
7227,"foobfall is sur3 full with surprises some of tehm unpleasant likie how the saints have a sexist rule , their cheerleaders can be t the same restzurant as the players , they must leave if a player arrives , makes me so mad"
7228,that is a frot5ball rule i don't understand . that wold only make sesne if it was for opposing teams but it would still be incredibly rude !
7229,"it woul dbe rude , you know its wejrd but an nfl game only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay ,"
7230,"the nfl sure does have lots of extra time for things like commercials , then !"
7231,"there is a lot of time indeed , did you know the patriots have a rb tha tnever fumbled the bzll , that must require crazy skills"
7232,that'as incredile ! unlike baker mafield . . . he used to be quarterback but no he is a gamer and plays halo 3 .
7233,"i heard he almost bnecame a pro gamer instead of ab ecoming a football player , i wonder how that decision would have worked ."
7234,"i might say it would be healthier to play football , but then i thought of the ijnjyries . . ."
7235,"and also all the brain damage football can cause ob players , a sangerous but beautiful sport indeed ."
7236,one myst really have a eep love for it to9 continue .
7237,maybe the faem and the status is what makrs mny players continue nad also the htirs tfor glo4y
7238,how's it going ! do you watch the nfl ? my favorite team is the seahawks !
7239,i love watdhing football ! mine is yhe steelers .
7240,oh nice . yeah i enjoy the nfl . i loved whent he seahqwks had the legion of boom era .
7241,oh yeah . did you know that thee is only 1 lefc thansed qb in the nfl and that is kellan moore ? i'm not familiar with him .
7242,me neither he must not be one of the popular players lol . one player i do remember is benjarvus greenlelis because he never fubled the ball !
7243,that's an incredible stat line yoh ave . browns qb baker mayfield almost quit football to pursue a career of competitive gaming . whazt was he thinking ?
7244,haha must have loved video games . can maek good money . bht nowadays ball players makr a lot . back in the 60's bowelrs made more !
7245,times have sure cahnged sinc3e tuen . i onder what the h9ghest football score 3ever was ?
7246,good question . i think it was when georgi tech defeater cxumberland 222 . i can' imagine how tht even would happen .
7247,holy smokes ! cumberland got whipped . did you know that the univetsity of iowa's visitors lockerr oom is painte dpinl ? wonder why ?
7248,haha yeah wonder what the other team mus ttgihn k. ya know that yellow 1st own line . . . espn won an emmy fo rthat !
7249,nice . i like that line . it changed the wsy you watch football . the circular huddle that all thre teams se was created by a deaf qgb so he could relay the plays via yis hands to the othe rplayers .
7250,oh yeah laul hubbard . i wondder why teams still continue to use it to this day ?
7251,i'm not sure . pretty interesting . the nflh as only 1 minutes of actual gameplay per game . that sees crazy for how much money they get paid .
7252,i agree that seems ridiculous and still so mnay injuries ! the nflh as no law against girls playing and yet no girls have yet . . . do you think they ever will ?
7253,i thin kat some poin t. . . maybe as a kicker or puntfer ? spekaig of girls . . . the new orleans saints cheerleaers are no tallowed to eat at the same restaurant at teh same time as an nfl player . mind ofa n odd rule .
7254,yeah tha tseems a bit unfair . shows how much trust they7 hage in their players . . . or cheerleaders . it's also interestin ghow th enfl uses tracking devices in shoulde4 padsa nd jelmets .
7255,that lmost seems liket gey are taking technology a little too far for a game . although there's big money involv3d so i can see them watning to fine t5une the gajme .
7256,"yeah . they can track a lot like velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location ."
7257,"int3eresting . it pays to e an negineer . in the l,ong run they make mor in a lifetimke than the average nfl or mlb players will make in their careers ."
7258,wow they really are smart ! have a good one !
7259,"hey there do you like watching footbal l? id on't really do that myslef , i'm not as ports guy"
7260,i acyually do . did you know snoopd og wrote a song for the high school team of his son ?
7261,no i didn't know that . have you heard what it sounds like ? i do know that one team painted their opposing team's locker room pink . i wonder how that worekd out for them haha
7262,ya hthat must not have been very pleasant . do you know who are th4 three most paid defens employees ?
7263,i think they're all football coahces aren't they ? that seems lik ea massive waste of money to me ?
7264,"yeah they are , not sure what to make of that really . do you kbow where is one of the largest high schools tadiums ?"
7265,no i don't can you tell me ? also have you headd of the higehst scoring football game of all tiem ? it was 222 to 0
7266,"the stadium is ina llen , texas with 1800p seats and cost 60 million to build . oh who played 8in that gam e?"
7267,"yep it was cumberland vs . georgia tech ,a nd georgia tech won . they must have either been amazing or cumberlandw as hoirrible i'm not sure which lol"
7268,wow that is a huge difference . did you know the majority of largest footbqll stadiums are in the us ?
7269,no i didn't know thyat . that's really crazy . did you know that the average nfl game only last for avout 10 or 11 minutes in terms of life gameplay ? that seems solo but explains why i geg really bred haha
7270,wow that is so short . did you know nowadays they put tracking ships on the players ?
7271,"i didn't know that no ? how does that work ? i do know that the new orleans saints cheerleaders have a lot of rules they have to abide by though . for 8instance they can't be in the same restaurant as a player , and if the player ernters the restaurant then they have to leave , thats eesm really stupid"
7272,well the tracking chips are in there to track velocity and speed and rotation so that they can use thse to make the game brtter . i find tba trule so srxist
7273,yep i agree with you . do y7u know any engineers ? apparently over their lifetiem they'll make more than any mlb player or nlf player for that mater
7274,i gjess that makes sense because football players jight make a lot but their care3r is short
7275,yep that's true . they just have to be smart wih their money i guess . do you like any nfl qrterbacks ? fo4 instance baker mayf8edl or alex smith ?
7276,"i like laex smih , hesrd he was super smart too as he finished college in 2 years"
7277,yep he is a genius . he wase ven workig on his ph . d before he joined the nfl . baker mayfield was almost sa fulltime video game playe . he is really good at halo e
7278,yeah heard he also has said that he can beat anypone in thatg ame at the u of kansas
7279,yep you'r eright . what about th ecircular huddle . have you heard about how that started ? it was startesd by deaf quarterback
7280,do you like football ?
7281,some
7282,i don't as i get a bit bored . there is only 11 minutes of gameplay during each gmae .
7283,"i think that is why budweiser is a sponsor , breaks th etedium"
7284,i do like budweiser commercials . the ftrogs stick out to me . i am looking forward to the super bowl because i wil. get together with friends .
7285,"would be great if girls could pass eligibilityr equirements , make it more interesting"
7286,"yeh , i heard there are qctually no rules against womeh playing . hopefully some women can play one day or even if mor einterest was shown in women?s professional leagues , that would be great ."
7287,"i don'y know much about teh rules but do like to hear comments liie one , ' ultimately , we have to fhrow the ball in order tl move it ' was hilarious !"
7288,i read that butw asnt sure exactly what it meant .
7289,"yeah , ind afunny tho in football games to hear , makes it entertaining for those of us that don't care much for feh fame otherwise ."
7290,"ah , yeah , i see . speaking of funny things , when tom brady was in hith school , his team kept losing , and they rrf8sed to start him , the backup quarterback . nw he's a four time super bowl champion !"
7291,"crazy right ! kol , gotta wonder about that coac ! funny stuff 12 heard too that new orleans cheerleaders can't eat in same restaurants as players ! gah !"
7292,i really wonder why that is ! sexism or something else ?
7293,"no clue , somnebody complained somewhere and a rule was born 2 voial ! something like who ztarted putting trackibng chips in player uniforms ? somebody ha an idea !"
7294,"yes , it's amazing what technology can do these days ! i heard espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line ."
7295,"whoa ! no kidding , big stuff emmys , especiakly for a sports channel eh ? nice ! clever though , ehlps out those of us that need a little help lol !"
7296,right ! it helps me keep track of things that are goig on . whwt do yu think baout the redskisn ? i hear thar the redskinsd efense has improved this year . they beat the cowboys 2017 .
7297,"oh ? well , haven't they always hate d6he cowbogs though ? great to grt a hcance to beat them !"
7298,"yes , you're right ! it seems that redskins fans dislike the cowboys . the team takesz their competition very seriously , it seems"
7299,"on aother note of poswible interest to a nonfan , i heard that iowas locker room is painted pink for the visitingf ootbal teams a tthe university ! how cool is that !"
7300,that is funny ! though i wonder if it's supposed to be isnulting ? because don't a lot of nfl players dress in pink to show support for breast cancer ? maybe it's not sucfh a punioshment anymore !
7301,"oh ! clever thought , breast cancrr indeed ! but yes , i think it is supposed to be insulting like that sheriffs omewhere that maskes his criminals wear pink clothes lol but you've a good thought ! a good way to change it ul o thenm !"
7302,"ah , that is true . pink is srarting tob e cool though , i thihk !"
7303,hi ! are you a fa nof football ?
7304,"good , yes i am . are you ?"
7305,"i watch from tim eto time , mainly during th eplayoffs . it seems the moxst excit8ng then ."
7306,"yeah , i feel ya . 5hey could liven it up some if they had female players ! you know there;s no nfl against the m."
7307,"yeah , with how they treat cgheerleaders i doubt any woman is jimping to get to the nfl ."
7308,"i had heard about the new orpleans saints cheerleader that can't eat at the sane restaurant as players . that seesm like riscrinination , to e ."
7309,"i agree , especially that they have to leave i fthey are there nad a player walks in ."
7310,makes you woneer if thered was a specific incident that prompted a rule like that ?
7311,"it really dows . i dont know what i tcould hagve been . anyway , did you realijze there is really only 1 1minutes of adtiove game play in any given game ?"
7312,"i know there was alot of wasted time spent standing around and all , but waow ! that last superbowl i watched seemed like it dragged n for 4 hours !"
7313,"it did seem that say . i was following score updates online . the patriots pulled it out at 6he end , again ."
7314,"tm brady , he's the man . seems like he always saves tehm . he's one fine example of ag reat quarterbac k."
7315,"he os , they didnt realize hat early on with him though . his high school jv team woudnt play him despite never scoring or winning ."
7316,i bet they wish that hadn't done that to hi nm! i was sjrprised to learn that thete is only 1 left handed quarterback in the nfl .
7317,"same here , i wonder if it makes things harder for him , or the team . it must throw off the defense to ."
7318,"i would think it's more of an advantage once his team ges used to it . massively harder for th 4opposing team that's not used to it , thohgh . did you know the huddle came about because of a deaf quarterback ?"
7319,its because he didnt want the opposing team stealing his hand signals isn it ?
7320,"ye s, it was . did you know there was a player that never fumbled a football , note ven once , in his whole cadeer ?"
7321,"let me gues , he played for the patriots ? lol"
7322,"ot course , you kno9w they are my favorite team ! benjarvus green ellis was the playera nd i can't even bewgin to fathom the p5ressure he must have felt to remain perfect ."
7323,probably a lot . that is one amazing recorxd . its gbeeh great chayting ! have a niced ay !
7324,hi do you watch the nfl ?
7325,i sure do . id you knlw women can play too ?
7326,yeah as long as they meet the requirement there is no rule to stop them
7327,yup pretty much . there are only 11 minu tws of games play in a game
7328,yeah that is true and yet we are in front of teh tv for forever it s3ems
7329,yup pretty much . they are using tradking chips on the players in the field now
7330,yes they are collectinf a bunjch of info like velociy and rotation and such but not sure what for
7331,well i hope they can use them to maket he game safer for the players
7332,that sounds gkod to me . u of iowa paimted their visitor locker room pink
7333,i wondef why that is . bowlers us4d to make more thna football players in the 60s
7334,yeah thingsh ave really changed now . do you know qhat th4e highest score in college foot6ball is ?
7335,i think it was 2220 but i forget who played in that game . do you know ?
7336,"yes that was is and th egame was played between geogia tech who won , and cumberland"
7337,"yeah them thanks . espn won an emmy onc e, do you know what for ?"
7338,yes it was for the superimposed yellow line back in the day
7339,"yes and i am so grateful for taht line , it has made watching the games from home m8ch easier"
7340,true . do you know who benjarvus greneellis is ?
7341,yes he is a former rb who never fumbled the blaql i nhis career
7342,wow amazing talent there . do you know who kellan moore i s?
7343,yeah he is the onlg qb in the nfl that is left handed
7344,yeah i aonder if it gives him any advantages aqt all
7345,ard you a fan oft he nfl ?
7346,i'm not a grdet fan . i follow themz ome . how about you ?
7347,"me too , i used to al ot more yearsa ago , but i follow themh ere and there . a naverage nfl game only has like 11 minutes of actual gameplay now"
7348,that's a lot of time watchimg fo4r 11 minutes . and they say baseball moves 6toos low .
7349,right lol . botha re moving in that direction . would you say you have a favorite team to watch of the 32 ?
7350,i am a rams fan since i grew up i nsouthern cal . how about you ?
7351,"nice , rams almopst had it this year ! i am a vcikings fan , they almost had it last year ! is jared goff your favorite qb ?"
7352,i would have to say yes . i used to love fran tarkington when he was with the vikings .
7353,"for sure , he was a great quarterbacj back in the ay . have you heard of ales smith ?"
7354,"no , ho is eh ?"
7355,"he is the quarteback of the redskins , or was , heh ad a really bad injury this ysear on his leg . je was very smart , he got a degree as a sophmore adn then became the 1 overall pick as a qb"
7356,that s smart . interesting that they call soccer football . there may be more acxtion in soccer but nothing ever really happens .
7357,"right lol , too much fasle hopes in soccer . do you follow college football ?"
7358,"not at all . i used to follow all thje sports , but now its' maily basebal; . what sports do you follow teh most ?"
7359,i follow football and basketball most . my favorite college team is the iowa hawkeyes . inf ootball they paint the opponents locker room pink
7360,thqy's too funny .
7361,or bring y0ur own cans of paint lo l. they do it because pinkh as a natural calming effect if you see i t. psychology 101 i think
7362,sounds right . i thought they were trying to insult them l
7363,did you ever hear about the college game with a score of 2220 ?
7364,yes . would you have just walked pff the field if you were on dcomberlasnd ?
7365,"i would have walekd off the field when it got to like 1000 and nevetr played abain lol ! it was so nice chatting with you , enjoy your da !"
7366,"he;lo , how are you ? i just read he university of iowa's ;ocker room for visiting football team sis completely painted ponk"
7367,wow that is strange
7368,also strange is in the 1960'st op bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . isnt that crazy ?
7369,didn't hear htat one efors . did you know that 14 of the world's largest stadiums bleong to american college football teams ?
7370,"i did . that is crazy , i wonder shy the largest stadiums go to colleges ."
7371,maybe because ghe state is funding so they waste money on it
7372,makes sense i gess
7373,american flags at football stadiums can weight 1100 pounds and co0st 50000
7374,"yeah rihht , thats so much money for a flag ."
7375,"also , a high scyool stadium in texa sseats 18 , 000 people andc osts 60 million to build"
7376,crazy . did you know the nfl has no written rule against fremale players ; women wluld n fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements .
7377,i wish they'd get a chancve . sno0op dogg wrote af ight song for his high school's football team
7378,"tgats awesome , i wonder if it was rap lol former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumblec the football in his nfl career ."
7379,that's hard to believe ! lots of technology involved in nfll ike chips in shoulder pads to record playrs moves .
7380,"yeah , i guss that makes sense , i 3onder when they started doing that though ."
7381,"i don't know . more pressure i guess to make the right moves , but less brains and more computer brains involved"
7382,"alex smiyh took so many aqpt ests in high school tuat he entered hniversiry as a junior . the quart5erback received his bachelor's degree in two years , and began working on a master's degree , before becoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft ."
7383,"smart guy and motivated ! atyle5tes don't always get tue credit for their brains . on a funny not e, brad johnson is the only quarterback to throw a touchdown to himself in nfl hostory"
7384,"thats amazing , lkol how does that even work ?"
7385,i'm wondering mysel fow thqat was legal ?
7386,"i have noc lue , must have been by chance . good talking to you l, have a good one l"
7387,how much do you like football ?
7388,a lot . you ?
7389,"i really enjoy it , i prettym uch watch eveu single gamd that i can ."
7390,do you watch college or pro football
7391,"usually i watch the nfl , but occasinally i'll watch college ."
7392,i like pro cause it is more interesting . college football players most of them are not good . whag do you think
7393,i agree . the problem i have with college is that there is just too mnany people to remember . i know most nfl players .
7394,i concur . do you watch other countr8es' footbnall ljke canadian football
7395,no treally . if nothin gelse is on i might watch it or if i'n at a bar sometimes they have it on if no other sports are on .
7396,do you think af cor nfc win this year super bowl
7397,"i want the nfc ftow in it , but the chiefs are a really good team and i think they would be my pick to win it all ."
7398,i strongly ebleve the chief will make it to the conferenc ebut not so sure about suoper bowl cause of tehir runnong back situation
7399,"not havin gtheir stated will for sure hurt ghem , mahomes is a beast though . who do you think is gonna take the super bowl ."
7400,the rma cause they are prerty healthy
7401,"rams and chiefs are my current picks for the super bowl . they are both amazingly powerfult eams this year , seeing either one in the bowl would ben ice ."
7402,"yeah , both will be superbolw contending team for a while"
7403,for sure . i?m surprised at the rams olast gae against the bears . d you think they will have a tough time oif they play them again ?
7404,"in cold weather , it is for sure . by the wwy , nice chatting with you"
7405,"yeah , have a good day ."
7406,bye
7407,"hi , how are you ?"
7408,"hello , im great , what do you think about the jets and their goal to lanf kirk cousins ."
7409,it hink they dhoul be thankfl they did not land hi m. they got a great young qb isntead . . .
7410,"i think that is a grezat de3cisio n, i fthey have a ytoungq b then they can polish him , nad i ebt he wasnt as expensive as cousins ."
7411,"no , he was out of usc and rookie contracts are slotted so when he was chosen in the draf t, they knew what they were going to pay him before choosing him ."
7412,"oh i see , so he was cheaper tha ncous8ins then ? do you know how much they closed him for ?"
7413,probably around 4 years and 40m . whihc eeems like a lot but cousins got nearly 25m per year !
7414,"ih i see , hopefully the qb they picked was a greatc hoce , you know rbady wasnt picked to play with his hih school football team , he was benched al; the time and the tea, lost almost every game ."
7415,that's odd . maybet he coach sa whis talent and the lack of talent the offensive line had and drcided to spare him all the sacks . maybe he wa sprotecting him . . .
7416,"who knows maybe he was or maybe he didnt know he had a future hall of famer in his rooster , are you watching the super bplw this year ?"
7417,i am . what about you ? will you watch it ?
7418,"i will watch 8t for sure , with friends andf amily what team are you rooting fo r?"
7419,"i am indifferent . i root for a good game and a good storyline . if t has that , i uhsuallyd oj' tcare . althouhg every time i say that , i find myself rooting for one team during the game . it will probably be new this year . whio are you rootimg for ?"
7420,"i am rootingf or the patriots , i am a fan of that team its amazing how much the game had evolved , players now have chips to track their moves and the football does as well"
7421,are you frm ne ? i will be using chilps too . i think it will be bbq chipsf or the ga e.
7422,"yes i am , and i have bee nfan since i watched benjarvu sgreen ellis play , what a great r b!"
7423,he never fumbles ! i liked hij . had him in fantasy one year . i wonder swhere he went ?
7424,"he is retird now , has been for a few years at least ."
7425,do you think tomb rdy will retire if he win on sunday ?
7426,"i ghink he will , its a strong possibility , i htink he has won it all and should retire at a high peak ."
7427,good luck sunday . nice chattingw ith you !
7428,thank you . i will be ceering forb rady and te patriots for sure !
7429,do you think jon gruden and the raiders will get better next year qihtout mack ?
7430,"i dont know if it's really all the lack of mack that is making them lose , gruden is very new as a head coach of the raiders , mybe he hasnt found hit footing yet"
7431,"' cdhucky ' as he is affectionately knon , could hav done much better acxording to the critics"
7432,"isn't that a weird nickna,me ? i dont think i qould want to be known for my creppy smile l"
7433,he sure looked like chucky after the loss to th ejets and during the post game interview
7434,"it was a surprising lozs for sure , they weee leading at the half but 3"
7435,"mack has been huge for his nee team , the bears"
7436,hea he killed it in his first game against green bay . the bears are lucky to have him . theyre also a team that has a struggled a lot recently
7437,jmaybe if varr wouldn't throw so many interceptions it would hlep too
7438,yea after yis 3 in the 2nd half they lost their lead and ended up getting destroyed by 20 points
7439,darnold hasn't turned out to be the qb that the jets were hopingf or i don' think
7440,sone q2uarterbacks aren't earning their slaary . carr got paid 125 million m and didn't play very well .
7441,to upset gruden and think thath e is better than he actually is
7442,"out of the 32 teams ij the nfl , i think the raiders are4 close to the bottom"
7443,gruden is fed up with his team san dcarr''s poor play
7444,you woudl think that with ust 11 minutes of actua gameplay 9t wouldnt be that hard to coach a tewm to victory
7445,true . i have been rooting for gurley and goff all year and hope they give gurley the mvp award
7446,"that woul dbe possible . h eprobably maked a ton o fmoey too . which is crazy because when football started , even a pro bowler made twice asm uch as sar footbal lplayer . times hage chsnged"
7447,i am still no fan 9o dndamukong suh
7448,do you like peters and talib more ?
7449,i like tlib ferom gback when hew as with denver .
7450,are you interested in the ravens ?
7451,"not so much , i'm an eagles fan . arw you ?"
7452,i am near foxboro s i guess i am a patriots fan . i do not follow sports that uch .
7453,i can't believe it's almost tim efor the playoffs ! the first super bo2wl was at the end of the 1966 season .
7454,i remember that . i had already graduated from high school . i webt through high school with no super bowls . didn't miss it uch !
7455,haha . i hear ya ! did you know an average ndl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
7456,"i dob't believe that but it does seem like evry time they kck hte ball , they stop for a while to see what they did . i think it is a boring game ."
7457,"the highes tscore ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberalnd 2220 . i find that one hard to believe , too !"
7458,cumberland must have felt like sloinking off the field . i would like to hear what the coach ahd to say . ;lol
7459,"he was probably fired righta fter the game . in other countries , they clal socfer footall . i fknd soccer really boring ."
7460,ugh so do i . it's all too slpw . i rather watch basketball .
7461,"there are some interesting footbal facts though . the circular huddle ussed in todays american football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not read his hand signals ."
7462,a tleast he didn't have to listen to all of the fans screaming .
7463,very true 12 there is 9nly one left hande dquarerback in the nfl .
7464,it must be hard for him . the world id made fo righthanded people .
7465,sure is . i didn't rdaliz4 that bowlers made more than football players in the 60's !
7466,"bowling used to be very popiular . it'zs boring to watc , though , bu tfun to play ."
7467,i haven't bowed in a long time ! i heard that new orleans saint scheerleaders are forbisdden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player !
7468,i think that is a ridiculous rule . theyh ave to get up and leave . . . what if they are eating ?
7469,very old fashioned rule !
7470,some o fthose old rules should be chaned .
7471,i agree ! nice chatting with you q
7472,"you a football fan ? did gyou know tge un9versity of iowa visiting footgall teak locker room is painted pink ? for jind games , i g8esxs ."
7473,hello yes m i love football . that's crazy they painted the room pink . i wonder if it worked ?
7474,no idea . the highest ever score n a football game was 2220 in 1916 . prettyb ruta; .
7475,wow that's a craay high score ! the 1960's bowlers made twice a smuch as top football stars .
7476,haha . howt imes ahve changed . i bet bowlers don't even wmke 10 pervent of what footballers make now .
7477,"haha yea i have no idea what bowlers make , but i bet it's not a lot . did you know greenellis never fumbled in hi sentire nfl career ?"
7478,thwat?s a pretty great accomplishmnet . espn won an emmy for creating thue yellow fi5rst down mark on the field when you're watching games . that was a game changer for sure . hard to imagine watching games wiuthout it now .
7479,that's pretty cool . did you know tehre is no written rule against female players playing in the nfl ?
7480,i'd lov eto see a female in the league . nfl cheerleaders for hte saints aren't allowed to eat at hte same restaurant as the players . i guess theyd on't want them fraternizing .
7481,yea i think a lot of teams have rulers abou fraternizin with cheerleaders .
7482,"i guyess they lik eto keep track of things . ,like how tfhey use chips in th eplayers' shoulder pads to yrack every move on th efield ."
7483,that'e funny they kept chips . the average lifetiem earnings o9f an enginee is higher fthan the average lifetime earningd of an nfl player and an average mlpb player ?
7484,"huh , interesting . i gesxs because an engineer'sc areer lasts longer . never thought of it taht way . the average nfl ame only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . thank goodness for insysnt replays !"
7485,"yes , thank goodness for that . do you know much about quadrterbacks ?"
7486,a fair bit . like kellna moor is the only lefthanded qb in thue fnl .
7487,oh wow i didn't know that . baker mayfiel dalmost quit fpotball to pursue a career in professional gaming .
7488,"hhaa . what game did hse play , do yoi know ? alexs mith entered college as sa juniorf because he took so many ap tests ."
7489,"i have no idew what gmaes he played , but very funny ."
7490,"actually , i think it was halo 3 ! oen of tom brady's hs teams didn't win a game or score a touchdown allp sesson . he was on the bench the whole time ."
7491,i can't believe tom brady was never drafte d. it was a gem to find for hte patriots .
7492,"yeah , that's an understatement . been great taking with you !"
7493,hi how are you ?
7494,"i'm great ! hi how are yoh , too ?"
7495,i m doing well . are yu a fan of football ?
7496,i sometimes follow it . i try to watch the super bowl . you ?
7497,yes i am a pittsburg steelers fan ! did you know theres no written rules about girls playing in the nfl ?
7498,"yeah , that sounds right . i dont thik anyone ever expected women to try . do you think women will ever play ?"
7499,i doubt it . that would be ijpressive though . maybe as a kikcer if naything !
7500,"a kicker , sure . maybe a punterf . i figure hat htere is something ."
7501,true that . there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game on average . crazy !
7502,"yeah , a lot of standing around and waitinb . i could just watch the highlights and it would be enough ."
7503,i agree ! the saints are not allowed to eat in the same resyaurahnt as their cheerleaders .s o weird .
7504,these outdated attitudes should change .l the cheerleaderw are not the problme .
7505,totally . there is only one left handed qb in the nfl ! good for him .
7506,i wonde rhow often he plays . i bet it coupd htro woff teh defenses .
7507,i have no idea but that probably hslps !
7508,i wonder . i think that batters in basegall have triuble with certain pitchers . i figure it must have a parallel in football .
7509,im sure there is . funny that iowas visitor locker room is painted all in pink !
7510,"does that even qork ? if i tdid , every team would try the same stunt ."
7511,yoi wo8uld think . it sounds pretty dir5ty to me !
7512,"waht is the home record of u of iowa ? i rest my case . anywat , great chat !"
7513,no idea 2 nice chatting wkith you !
7514,have a great day !
7515,also funny how bowlers i n19860 made more than top football stars ! have a good one !
7516,"hello , do you liek football ? i think the qb is the mot im;ortant player on the team"
7517,"yea , a good qb like krt cousins gives the redskinz a better chanc ethan startingm ark sanchez"
7518,"he did providw tability to the team , are you a fan of the edskins ?"
7519,no but i'm a giants fans so i know a lot about tehi rrivals . losing cousins to the vikings really hurt the redskins
7520,"i be it did , cousins is a good player , i bet hte vikings knew that , hopes he haqs a great carreer htough"
7521,yea it's too bad smiuth got injured too after he ended up repalcing cousins
7522,smith is ohe of the oldest players on the team right ?
7523,8 believe so . too bad the redskins didn't try to get mayfield . hes' the brownx 30th starting qb
7524,"i think thne patriots have the best qb on the leagye , brady is a great leader"
7525,yea brady is great . so is rivers of the chargers
7526,"yeah rivers is naother plqayer that i likme , what do you think about qb like alex smith or mayfield ?"
7527,i think mayfield has a lot of potentiala nd before his injury smith was a reliable bq
7528,"i think they are both good , you know that mayfield is also a great gamer ,"
7529,"yea , i hard he like halo . did you know rusell wilson has a major league baseball contract ?"
7530,"i dpnt really onow who he is son o comemnt there , is there an interesting fact behind that contract ?"
7531,"swilson is the qb fo rthe seahawks , he used to play mino rleague basbeall and signed a contract with the tx rangrs"
7532,"oh i see , itneresting , did you hear wbout benjarvus greenellijs ?"
7533,i rdemember eh use to play for the patriots not to lng ago
7534,"yeah around 2011 , cool fact about him , he never fumbled the ball in his entire nfl carreer ! ! !"
7535,thar's impressive . did you know that coach matt partricia is an actualr ocket scientist ?
7536,"a rocket scientist ! ! ! wow that is impressive , he musf be a rrally msart man ."
7537,are you a football fan ?
7538,i am a fan of the game do ou like th nfl ?
7539,"i do wqtch on tv wehn my saints are playing ;. iuts not quite the same as being tuere , but tickets are too expensive . i like the yellow 1st down line on tv whikch gives a perspecftive of how far it i8s . did you know espn won an em,my for that cretin .?"
7540,"so you are a faj of the saints , cool , and no , why did espn won an emmky for ?"
7541,"espn won an rmmy for the yellow line overlayed on the field so when watching on tv , the c9ewer knows how far it is to first down . it gives a bit of perspective on what is going through the quarterack's midn . do you have a fvorite quarterback ?"
7542,"i guess the yellow fierst down line is a big contribution to the game and yeah mine is tom brady i also like alex smith , do you hve a favrite one ?"
7543,"brees , obviously . histoerically , i liked archie manning , but he did not have yhe evel of success on the field that his sons had . what i did not know is thbat at ine time , the nfl had a deaf qb , paul d . hubbard . he createdt he corcular huddle so the opoosig team could not read his hnad sgnals !"
7544,"those soundsl ike great qbs im not famioiarized with them ,b aekr mayfield is wnother grea6t qb and sounds like hubbard created a legacy ."
7545,i would say so considering they still use the circular hudel . i was surprised and pleased when i learnec that we had a femael nfl referee officiating the ppayoff games . do you ever think we will bave female nfl players ?
7546,"i don't think so , maybe a wole other divisio nbut not in the same league as men's , i think that would be really unfair and actally scary to watch"
7547,"probavly so , but perhaps a woman will try out since the league rule sallow it should seh meet the eligibility requirements . perhaps as a kicke rsince it i sa lower contact position . what are your thoughs on tech in football like the tracking chips the ntl use on shouder pads andc in the ball ?"
7548,"i think that tech ks taking over the gam eand that is great , all kinds of coo lstzts can be known thanks to that so o think its great , tats such as 5he moves of players , speed of the ball nad many more ?"
7549,"i also think is coulrd be a good training aid , especially for the qb . it could let the qb know the speed and rotation of the throw ; aftwer all the best throw is a fast tight spiral . do you foplow collegiate football ?"
7550,"i do follow it , some of te tiem at least but mostly nf l, kind of makes me angry that games only have 11 minutes ofl ive gameplay ."
7551,"i am having trouble figuring out where the rest of the time goes . after all , they only 20 secnds tko huddle , line up , and snap the ball . i gues ift he play lasts less than 20s econds and results in a dead ball then that could b epart of the reasson why !"
7552,"yeah i guess xo still seems like little tiem , games tend to last a long time and only 11 minutes is unfair to fans ."
7553,"true . i prefer to watch it live and am a season ticket holder for my alma mater , the lsu tigers . dud you know that hte highest scoring f9otball game was in collegiatew ith georgi atehc beating umberland 2220 in 19q6 ?"
7554,"2220 ! ! ! is that real ? wah , how ca na team lose by that many pointsw ere they even playin gthe same sport lol ."
7555,what i also find interesting is some of the quirky offfield rules . lik the one forbidding saints fheerleaders from eating in the same restaurant as nfl players . its unfair that theym ust leave even if they were there first and already eating !
7556,"that is really unfair , the nfl shoul ban that rule and hte sains should change it not only sexist but aslo humil,iating rule , makes me fele angr6 and disgusted ."
7557,it seems so immature ! like the university of iowa painting the visiting football team's locker room all pink ! is that suppose to humiliate o rintimidate the opposing team ?
7558,"that is so funny , can you imafine being the opposite team and then arriving at sn all pink locker room , the look in their faces j7d6 priceless anyway its been col chatting with you today ."
7559,"thanks and same to yiu ! and keep your day job . after all , an engineer , or likely almost any tehcnicak professional , 3arns more in their .ifetime career than the average nfl player !"
7560,"hello there , are you excited for h4 upcoming super bowl ?"
7561,"of course i am , countin gthe hours till sunday what team are you cheering for ?"
7562,"i tbink i will be cheering on hte ram , but mostly for hte score dependint on what numbers i get ib any kind of pool i'm in . how abou tyourself ?"
7563,"i am rooting for the patriots , are the rams your favorite team i nthe leage ?"
7564,"no i am a packers fan l i just think the rams had a good season and desere it , plus the pats have won it enough recently ! how about you ?"
7565,"yeah could be , my favorite tm is are the patriots but i wouldnt mind if they lose , i just want to watch a great game !"
7566,"yeah i'm the smae way , i like when the game is a game still late in the 4th quarter and it takes some awesome plays to win it ."
7567,"i agree , so did you know abgout hte tracking chips the players have ?"
7568,no i don't know too much about taht . i omagine they have them in their ehlmets to track yits for concussion studies ?
7569,"i think they track the moves to have a better ideaq of the plays , location , distance runned amont others , thje football also jas a chip ."
7570,"yeah i think you afe righ t, pretty sure they have them in hsoulder pads as well ."
7571,you know engineers end up winning more money than football players and without all that brain damage .
7572,"yeah i hink i ahve rea dthat they ear more in a lifetime overall , probably because they work their whoel career vs . average football players maybe 8 years ."
7573,"hen you put it that way a footgall player does earn more , in the 60s they didnt as bolers made more money that football players ."
7574,yeah isn't that crazy to rhink the top bowlers were the big ballers back in the 60's . oh man what a life to be a pro bowler in the 60's lol .
7575,"i wonder how much they actually earned lol , did you hear about thee mmy espn won ?"
7576,i think i remember them winning one after they came out with the yellow line for the first down line on tv games right ?
7577,"yewh that is right , i guess it is pretty usefull and deserves an award , it did chznge things"
7578,"yeha it definiely is very useful to everyone watching on tv . do you know what th3e highest scorinfg game ever was , college or pro ?"
7579,"i dont know about pro , i ncollege it was 2200 k thts a humiliating loss ."
7580,"yeah you zre ribht ! isn't that just an insane score , you would have to score on basically every pla . well nice hcatting with you today , i hope you have a good day ."
7581,"hey ! it's quite interezting , but nfl has no written rules against fmale players . it's just difficul5 to believe ."
7582,ixn'rt it ! fthey would have to be some tough females !
7583,"ttue . i tsays they have to neet te eligibility requirements , but i'm wondering what kind of requirements they may have ."
7584,"alex smiht took so manya p tests in high school that he entered university as aj unior . the quarterback received his bache.lor's degree in two years , and begn workiny on a master's degree , before becomign the first overall pick in the 205n fl draft . ig would be interesting to see !"
7585,"it's amaxzing . i'm sure it's difficult to combine all together ,b ut he is very talented"
7586,"this is relaly interesting too ! baker amyfield , quarterback , university of oklahoma , once considered quitting football to pursue fulltime comperitive gaming , adn claims to be sble to beat anyone at the unuversity f oklahoam oneonone in halo 3 ."
7587,i didn't now that . i guesa mot so many people know it .
7588,i bet he would not have mae the moneyh e is no ! i didn?r know the nfl was 32 twams .
7589,quite surprise for me aht the averagwe lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earning of nfl player . i was sur5e they make a lot
7590,thats all you hear ! how much they make . an averge nfl game only has 11 minutes og liv egameplay
7591,ig shocked me . i cannot believe . just 11 minutes ? ? ? ? ?
7592,yes ! and the average game lasts 2 . 6 to 3 hours !
7593,"honestly , i'll take a look in the internet . it's just difficult to believe ."
7594,"let me know what you find ! nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located isnide footballs to track : veloity , rotation , ball speeda nd locztion ."
7595,good poin . nfl has a lot of data .
7596,"definktion of football . football is a fmily of team sports that involve , to varying degrees , kicking a ball to score a goal ."
7597,it's very rboad definition . soccer refelc it for sure .
7598,"yeha , i had never heard of association foobtall ."
7599,do you watch or play s;ort often ?
7600,"no , not at all . you ? tje highest score ever in a football game occrred in 19i16 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220"
7601,it was long time ago . i'm not sure it would b epossible in 2019
7602,especiall with only 11 minutes of actual play time !
7603,absolutely !
7604,back h3n they even made mordm oney in footbal . in the 1960's top bowlers maede twice asm uch as top footbal; stars .
7605,"i didn't know it ! well , it was my leasure to falk with you . have a good day !"
7606,u2 ! nice talming with you !
7607,thankos .
7608,good mornin to you
7609,"hello there , do tyou follow the nfl ata ll ?"
7610,"i sure do , i watc hthe game every sunday when its on , do you ?"
7611,"yeah i usually follow durin gthe s4ason , my team didn't mak ethe playoffs this year so that was disappointing ."
7612,who is your tram ?
7613,"i like the pack3rs , do you8 follow a tea m?"
7614,yea im a patriots fan . sorry haha
7615,"lol , well you have had one gell of ar un the last 20 years or so !"
7616,"ohj yea , weve been lucky with tom brady"
7617,"yeah you sure have , the coach as well , bellicheck will go downa s the best ever in my opinion ."
7618,he is pretty good ! but robert kraft ? uh oh haha hes gotten inti some troubel
7619,"yeah that wasn't whagt i would of done with that much money , jus tfly t vegas for the day !"
7620,or have an esacort come to your house ! cmon man
7621,"exactly , now he will be forever associated with this incident !"
7622,"ah well , it doesm ake for kind of a funny story . did you know tom brady actually played backp qb in high school for junipero serra high echool and was never started ?"
7623,"holy crap , i never knew hat . i wonderw hat scouht for college was like , hrey whos that guy on teh bench ?"
7624,haha right ? and what woul dhave made him to scou tbrady for the collleg3e team ? stories like tha tare ironic
7625,yeah those storkes are ! funny how some of the best ever start out .
7626,"i wonder when we will start to see female nlf palyers , theres no written rule against having them on ghe teams"
7627,"i think that would be so cool if one did , it would give young girls in all sports hope to make it pro ."
7628,it would . i wonder why none have hoppe donto the trend yet
7629,"hi , how are you doing today ? it is certainly a fine day for a chat with new friend s."
7630,hi ! hope you're doing well ! so are you a fan of thwq b position ? i am simply because he touch3s the ball enarly every play on offense plus calls the plays in teh huddle !
7631,"the qb i sthe mna . h eruns the show , and makes things go , don't you know !"
7632,so true ! isn't crqzy there's only one left handed quarterback in the nfl and that's kellan moore ?
7633,i guess there must be an ksxsue with leftiees . perhaps the offense must be run differently ? i don't know . interesting thougy .
7634,"agreed . can you also be,ieve the circula4 huddle american football uses today was invented by a deaf qb so opposing teams couldn't read his hand signals ? that was very smart of him !"
7635,that was certainl very smart of him ! now everyone copies that deaf qb . a trendsetter indeed .
7636,very true ! then you?ve got geniusesl iek alex smith who entfered college as a junior and earned his bachelor's in two years . that's someone i'd want on my team ! ha !
7637,he must have studied very hard and done well in his coursework . he probably had ther ight mind for a qb .
7638,"ineeed ! but then you hafe qbs like baer mayfield who consideredq uittig football for competitie gaming . that would have been a huge mistake , in my opinion !"
7639,"i agree . tye koney , the glory . football much better ! much !"
7640,"so trur ! i tell tyou , i couldn't believe tom brady's jv high teamr efuse dto start him despite never winning a game or even scoring a touchdown . that is sad and i bet they regre tthat since he's now a four time superbowl champ !"
7641,"he's got five now , right ? even moire regtet for them ! lol"
7642,no kidding ! he's a great player . i truly love the nfl bu tit surprised me that the average gaje is only 11 minutes long in terms of live gameplay . that' salmost unbelievable !
7643,i think it's still a tough game . lots of injuries . short careers .
7644,"agreer . i believe hte short careers is why egnineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players , sadly ."
7645,don't let your sons and daughters grow up to be nfl players ! it ain't worth it !
7646,"no kidding . speaking of income , did you know the top bowlers made more than top foobtall players back in the 1960s ? that is crazy !"
7647,i htink it was a golden age of bowling . the polyester pants made hte bowler physique quite charming .
7648,"tha is true ! but with plzayers like benarvus greenellis who's enver rumbled the football in hi entire pro career , i'd imagine he eeerves morfe than the top bowlers these days . ha !"
7649,"yes , he does . anyway , great chat ! have a good day !"
7650,"and of course , i'm surprised the league has no female plqyers sincd there's no rules fobridding them from playinmg as long qas tehy meet the eligibikity requirements ! well it was great chatting wit you as well ! take care , friend !"
7651,"hey there , do you have a favorite quarterback or anything lik ethat ? i like to watch tom brady a lot"
7652,"yeah , he's prettt cool . h4's a favorite in his uometown of san kateo , c a. i can't believe he was passed up on when h ewas on the jv team of his high school . their los s!"
7653,"yeah that d4finitel6 was a stupid move on their part . alex sjith though maybe he m,issed his calling . he was a genis and got his bachelor's degree in ojly two years . and he was working on his master's but then was drafted into the nfl . he might hace bremn able to do a whole ,ot more without doing the football thing"
7654,"wow ! i know , right ? ! i wish i webt off to college my junior year in high school but at the rate he was gvoing with his ap tests , its not sueprise he would skip 12 grade in high school . hte fact that he could baance all of that an dfootball is pretty amazing . he's an athletic genius : ,"
7655,i agree with you ! what do you think about keklen moodre as well ? he's ghe only lefcthanded quarterback in the league i wonder if that gives him an advantage or not ?
7656,"that says a lot , i know that lefty's are highly regarded in general . i think it coukd g8ve him an advantage since most p.ayers may be right handed so he's able to really dodge the other players when passingt he ball . i bet he didn't fumble hte ball as much either ."
7657,"yep that'a s good point l w ehave to do some research on that l. also , i wonder if the deaf quarterback did rsearch when he invented the circular huddle . it's such a geniu sthing , that i can't believe it was invented earlier"
7658,that was a pretty clever move on their part because you know thje opposing team is always looking for ways to figure out their opponnts next move . i wonder if they have any deaf quartebracks no w? they would probably do better than the players that can hear because somstimes those guys dopn'
7659,that's a good questiln . i don't think that they have them in the professional weeks anyway . did you hear about how the university of iowa painted the opposing team's lockerroom pink ? that woulkd actally make me play better i tnink
7660,"wow , totally emasculating to say the least lol but you're right , it would make me want to work harder at winning so that my team gets the last laug h: , do you think the locker room is still pink or was that back in the day ? i would think they would not have itt ha way now because everyone is so worried about being politicqally correctt ese days ."
7661,"haha you're right about taht ; i guarantee someone would complain baout i . edo ou kno wthe uighest football score of all time by the way ? it was 2w2 to 0 , talk about a blowout lol"
7662,"yeah , i would say 5aht team got beat don lol kinda embarrassing for the losing team . maybe that team was in the wrong division to start with . i haven't seen anything that high of score dver . i guess that was more like a practice game for georgia tech . i wonder how the cumberland team is doing now ? i'm sure their coach reminds them to note ver allow that agaih lol"
7663,"that's a good question . because k don't really watch colletge sports i don't know , hopefully they're doing better though lol i don't think they ahve qa buy like benjarvus greneellis though he's never fumble dthe ball they 3ould hav4e done a lot better if they had him"
7664,"oh yeah , benjarvus greenellis was the man ! a telasth e can always brag about not ever fu,lbing the ball to the grand kids . i'm sure not every football player cab say the same . wghere is geenellis now ? di dhe amke hqll of fame ? i hope so !"
7665,"i hope so too ! i don't oknow that he plays anymore , but i dln't really keep up with football that much now . i also thin kit' scrazy how htey us etracking chips on the players . texhnolovies becoming so advanced now"
7666,"yes , technjology has taken over so uch . pretty soon they'll embe da chip in hte players body which they should because some of those guys ar etrouble makers lol i don't follow football much bu tthey seem to make headlines lol i laso noticed how much the nfl has advanc3ed in otner technological ways with all the angles they are able to gey on camera during the games and the wireless microphones htat the team coaches and asxistants get to wear to track their tea mmore asw ell ."
7667,"yep i could see that . it's kind of scasry and hopefully they can take those chips and cameras off oncet hey leave the feld . i hope that civilinas never have to wear htose , because you can track everything from location to speed to velocity and rotation , it's a chagning world that's for sure"
7668,"its a little creepy if you think about it . but i totally agree , i hope tbey'r eable yo have a little privacy once they are off teh field . i noticed that women are able to play in the nfl if they pass the requirements needed to play . i don't know if i would want to play among al lkthose saweaty bg guys ll but i thijk its pretty cool for a women to play . i think there is one female in the nfl that i know of ? not sure though ."
7669,"no htere is not a femzale playe4r in hte nfl yet . but there is no rule against it . i would be very interested to see one start playing though . there is no rule so it's possible , but they would have to be reallyg ood , that's for sure , adn also know how to take a hit potentially"
7670,exactly ! i wonder how the male players would feel about tackling down a femaqle the way they do their fellow male team mates . but i'm sure it w0uldn't be so bad given thzt the gam eonly has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
7671,"yep that's true . and laso , would they all use the same locker room , or if there was only one girl on the team would dhe get her 9wn locker room , who knows ? i just don't know how it would work but i'm sure we could figure out a way so that evceryone would be happy"
7672,the nf lis one of the major sports league in north americ a.
7673,do you watch the nfl ?
7674,"yes . it my favourite sports , the nlf regular season starts from september to december . whoch is your favourite tea, ?"
7675,my favorite team is the baltimore ravens . wnhat about yours ?
7676,super bowl is my favourit e. nfl earn high revenue higher than other olayers .
7677,i would bet the quarterbacks are the highest paid rteam members . they tend to be the most famous players .
7678,quarterbacks are members of the offensive team and line up directly behind the ofensive team .
7679,"even though they line up behindr the offensive line , they are considered the tea leader ."
7680,nfl uses tracming chips int he playe5s shoulder pad to recor dtheir movekent in the field . this type technllogy improveemnt make the gaem very effective .
7681,"i think it would be interesting to see a diagram of the recorde movement . nfl players move around a lot in a game , even with just 11 minu5es of live gameplay on average ."
7682,they are using circular huddle pad to avoid other yeam players watch the sign in the field . this type of tactics are very importang and make the gake very intereating .
7683,"football requires a lot of strategic skill and tacgics to plwy successful plays , since neihted team knows what the other will do ."
7684,"in october 1916 , the game bheld btween georgia tech and cumberalnd , it is the highes tsc9ore game in footabll when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 ."
7685,"you almost have to wonder if cumberland' steam was sleeping on the field ! it's rare for a teamt o score p po9nts . even if tey just played d3fensively , you'c think they woudl have stopped the opposing team from scpring so much ."
7686,"yeah . it is very true . i couldn't imagine how it happens , the poor performance by cumberland . it waz a black day for cumberland ."
7687,they could use a payer like the patriots' running back benjarvus greenelli s. he's never made a fumble in his entire time in the nlf !
7688,yes . the fnl has no writtenr ule against female players .
7689,8 wonder what the physical requirements are for a womant o be able to lay . i would personally be scared to go o nthe field with all those powerful guys around me !
7690,"they are making fit fr the gake , it is very encessary to maintain good health condirion for playing ."
7691,"i can be.ieve that . they train to ne so fast and strohg . some of them are very smart 5oo , like alexs mith . ue took advacned placements tests kn high school and did so well hee ntered college as a thirdyear student !"
7692,all the players are trained to achieve the excellence so they are working hard . they re very highly paid athlete compared to other player .
7693,"it makes me feel like i ought to go do some exercise myslef , even if i'm no football player ! i5t was great talking to you ."
7694,good day there . yoj a football fwn ? i am mad the nfl season is ove r. th esuperbowl was kind of dissapointing but i enjoyed the 16 regular season games .
7695,"nhello there , i am and i agree ! 9t wasn't as fun qs o6her years , my team didn't even make the playoffs so that was sa d."
7696,oh bumme r! yeah just have ytow ait until next year . maybe it wikll be mre exciting . the nfl tracks movements oif players and the ball using a chip !
7697,"yep , always next season . and yeah , i think that is good , i hope it helps wi6h players afety ."
7698,yeah me too . eo many injuries . football wans't al2ays populr though . back in the 60's bowlers made more ! twice as much in fact .
7699,yeah there really are a lot . and wow ! 9 gues sit shows just how popular the nfl has become since then .
7700,exactly . there are also various other forms o football like rugby and australian rules .
7701,rthere was a big australian rules tournament ejld in my topwn last summer !
7702,oh that's awesome ! do they have a quarterhack it'z one of my favor8te positions because they touch theb all almost every play .
7703,"i don't hteyd id , and yweah they are the4 most important player on the fiedl even during a team game l"
7704,yeah . tom brady is one of the best . did you know he dudn't even start when he played junior varsity in high sch9ool ?
7705,"yeah he sure is , and i think i read that , wonder how he got scouted in the first plce ?"
7706,yeah good question . the qb alex smith is a smart guy too . he tooo so many ap classes that he got his degree in 2 years !
7707,"holy cow , that is umressive , it sounds like he couold have gone itno any field he wanted ."
7708,yeah agreed . funny yu say that because baoer mayfield's field of choice was almost competitive gaming !
7709,"that is hilarious ! i think i read about that a while back , do you ,now his game was ?"
7710,yeah believe it was hlao 3 ! wonder if he sgill plays video games ?
7711,"that was it ! good cal l, ad i'm sure he does , but probably fortnight or something now ."
7712,yeah fortnight is crazy popular . i wknder how much they make in comparison to the nfl ? despite wha everyone thinks engineers actually make morem oney in their life than nfl players .
7713,"isn't that itneresting , but i think it is because theuy have a very long career as opposed tos ports players ."
7714,yeah those nfl players get hammered with injurie s. very tough on the body . but some player5s can take th ehits liek greenellis who never fumbled the abll once !
7715,do you watch football ? there'?s no written rule tha twomen can't play in teh nfl . i'd love to see that !
7716,i do watch it ! who your favorite team ? and me too ! i wonder if nay have ever tried out yet
7717,my favorite team is the cotls . who's your favorite ? the average nfl game only has about 11 minutes of actual gameplay . thank gokodness for instant replay !
7718,i root f rteh patriots . 11 minutes is so short ! the game stops so often
7719,thisd is interesting an engineer over the course of his or her career will earn more than an nfl player . crazy .
7720,"well if you think about it , an engineer may have like , 45 workign years . an qverage nfl career might knly be 10 years at the most , and this average factors in the regular players . not everyone isx a superstar making millions"
7721,"true . speaking of the patriots , former rb benjarv8s greejellis never had a fumble n his career . wonder how many times he had the ball ?"
7722,haha i hope morr than 1 or else tha sta risnt as impressive . i feell ike he was a common target back in his day
7723,the highest ever footabll sco5e was 22w0 i9n 1916 . the ohter team couldn't even get on the board .
7724,i wodner at what point they just gave up and tried to rack up the score ? i fee; like they couldnt have been that dominated
7725,"haha . in the 60's the top bowlers made more than the football etars . oh , how gtimes have changed ."
7726,rigth ? i wonddr why ! nowadays i bet most eople cant name even oen pro bowler
7727,"i know i can't . i don't even know if they show bowling on tv anymore , liket hey used to when i was younger ."
7728,"i definitely cant name any , and i also have never even seen bowling on tv . i imagine it would be prety boring to eatch"
7729,"oddly , i used to watch it a lot in the 80's . but we only had 3 4 channels and it was the onlu thing on . did you know espn won an emmy for the creation of the first yard line yellow line on tv ? wha5 a great innovationj ."
7730,thjat yellow lin esaved football n tv i say . if is an absolute sapl and probably one of the most important inventions for tv football
7731,total;ly agree . i remember when they tried to apply to the same sort of thing to the hockey puck . wasn't as popular .
7732,which i think it 3ould be way more useful in hockey ! i can never follow that puck
7733,me neither . u think it was a good idea . but the hardcore fans hated it sot hey dumped ig . did yoh know ekllan moore is the only lefthanded qb in the league ? wonder if that gives him any kind of advantage .
7734,i feel like it would help him sometimes becau7se so many liemen might be trained to aim for the qbs right side
7735,"yeah , i wa sthinking the same thing . any advantage is a good advantage . qb alex smith took so many ap tests in hs that he started college as a junior . smart kid ."
7736,"thata an insane amoun tof ap tests , i cant imagine how he coul dhave mznaged all o fthat in high school , i could barely manage 1"
7737,hhaa . same heee . hew as working on his master's degree before he was drafted frst overall inb teh 2005 drat .
7738,he had a good fallback plan at elast ! did you know the mnodern huddle was freated by a deaf qb back in the day because he hacd to use hand signals ? he didn't want hte other team to see what he was signing
7739,that's awesome !
7740,high how are you
7741,good . ia tom brady still with the patriots ?
7742,ye she s fod now .
7743,when is the nxt ndlp championship game ?
7744,i think next month .
7745,do you have ahy guess which team i going to win ?
7746,no i have no clue . you ?
7747,the patriot s?
7748,maybe i wouldl iket hem to bu twho knows .
7749,i'm not that familiar with nfl team s. i know it consists of 32 teams .
7750,"yes . the nfl's 17week regular s3ason runs from early september to late december , with each team playin g16 games and having one bye week ."
7751,are youg oing to watch the next super bowl ? it's usually held first sunday of february .
7752,yes i will be watching with my family .
7753,do you usually watch the games at home ? my friend clberate the super bowl like it is christmas .
7754,yes i watch at home
7755,do you know that the american flags you see at stadiums weigh 110 0oounds ?
7756,i had no clue hard to believe
7757,"they cst approximately 50 , 000 to make them ."
7758,wow thats a lot of money
7759,nfl owners can afford it .
7760,oh espn won an emmy for the creation of th esuperimposed yellow line rep5esenting the first down line gor american football games .
7761,i did not knowt hat . did they collaborate with the nfl ?
7762,yes they did
7763,i have to run . it was nice chatting with yiou .
7764,hi how are you ? are you a football person ?
7765,"love the sport , baker mayfiled is one of my favorite players , what about yourself ?"
7766,i dont know baker . who is he ?
7767,"he is a famous qb , he had a strong debut on the browns"
7768,"oh , did the browjs do well this seaso n? is he one of the best in the league ?"
7769,"i don't think his the best , brady is the best qb in the elague but mayfield ha dstrong skills"
7770,"brady plays for the patrio0ts , yes ? he is one of the best . six rijngsa t this point ?"
7771,"9 think he does yeah , he is a legend and the most important player in th3 team , well quarterbacks are usually the most important players in the field"
7772,"ywah , they touch hte ball on every play , s i guess they have to eb talented . who are the o5her good qbs ?"
7773,"kellan moore is another great one , he used to be hte only left handed qb on the nfl"
7774,why the only one ? is there a problem with lefties ?
7775,"i hae no idea i think there are a couple more now another good qb is rbad johnson , he holds an itneresting stat"
7776,brad johnson ? don tknow him . he is not a lefty is he ?
7777,"no , he is the only qb in nfl history to throw a td pwss to himself ."
7778,how d8ifd he do that ? by accident ? i want to see the film of that .
7779,yea hi think that the ball got tipped on a defensive player and then he caught it .
7780,that ie great ! one for the record books . what do you htink of u of iowas little stunt ?
7781,"i think thjat stunt was really funny , the magic of football not only strange anecd0tes bt funny ones as well"
7782,"i wonder if it works at all . does u of iowa win at hom e? anyway , great hcat"
7783,"thats a topic for a google search as a matyer of fact im going to look over t6hat righ tnpw , its been great chatting with you as well , bye"
7784,have a great evening ! thanks for the hcat .l
7785,"a lot of cool facts , i feel lot wiser , thanks a lot , bye ."
7786,hi how are you ? do you like 5he football ?.
7787,"hello , i'm a life long football fan ."
7788,i do not really know the game well . i sometimes watch . usually the playoffs .
7789,at least yo watch the iportant games . the rest is just positioningy for playoffs .
7790,i guess . who is yur favorite team ?
7791,i like the cincinnatji bengals . how about you ?
7792,i like the udnerdog in the su;er bowl . i think that it is fun when they beat the favored team .
7793,"haha , yes it's very ewsy t5o r9ot for an underdog . speaking of underdogs , i was shocked to read there s only 1 lefrt handed qb in all of the nfl ."
7794,why is that . is there somthng unusual about lefties ? are they a problem ?
7795,"kellen moore is th eonly lefty . it's subtle differneces , fhe ball spins different and th qb's blindside is opposite ."
7796,so the rest of the team has to play differently ? ok . that would maks ense . then the coac hhas to make different plays ?
7797,"they don't play different exactly . you just have your bsst linema nblocking the blindxside as thag's where the defenses best oayer usually line sup to attack theq b from out of vision line ,. htat blocker never learnst o play right side . plhus just fewer people are lefties i assume lol ."
7798,ok . that akes sense . what do you thin kof the university of iowa and their little paintiny scheme .?
7799,it looks nice on tv .
7800,i supposs it is a plasing color for the tv audience . i hadnt thougn of that .
7801,i assume the intent was to belittle o;ponents like they are little girls but it looks coo lwhent hey show locker room shots i think .
7802,j dont mind pink it gets me excited to play . i want to p0lay harder when i surrounded by pink .
7803,i love when the nfl players wear pink shoes andg loves during breast cancer awarenss month . it just pops and very slick loking . what do you think about that or
7804,i think that it wuld be a little toom uch for me in my pink locekr room . there is such a thing as too much .
7805,"haha very true , they knew what theg were doing when they painted the visiting locker room pink ."
7806,"they were not interior decorators . they should have consulted experts . anyway , thnks for the chat !"
7807,ver trui eindeed ! have a great day stranger !
7808,"tahnks . you too , total stranyer !"
7809,bye !
7810,"hello , do you know much about quarterbacks ?"
7811,i know a little trivia about that particular football position . are we referring to american footbal lor canadian sgyle ?
7812,american football . did you know alex smit htoo kso many ap tests in high schookl that he was a junio when he went to college .
7813,smart dude ! he even started working on his master's before he became the overall 1st pick in the draft .
7814,very smart guy . the circukar huddle was created by a qb who was dedaf .
7815,yeah . wasn't his name hubbard ?
7816,yep i believe so .
7817,deaf qbs arer are in the nfalmost as rare as lefthandedq bzs . i think there is only one kn the league right now . . .
7818,yes they are . i can't think of many left handers over the years . only other one that comes to mind is vick .
7819,"i think the current one is named kellan moore . some of hte greats were lefthanddd , such a john elway and jim kelley ."
7820,oh ydea i forgota bout elway . baker mayfield once thought about quitting football to pursue a career in professional gaming .
7821,mwyfield . . . wasn't he qb at the univ of oklahoma ?
7822,"i can't r3call where he played in collwg e, but that sounds right . he plays for the browns now ."
7823,tha tis a team that has nha da rough go at the position f qb ! their franchise woiuld be alot different today if they had a q blike supebrowl champion tom brady .
7824,yea they have had terrible luck with qbs . did you know the nfl has no written rule against women playing ?
7825,are you suggsting that clevekand should considrr putting a woman in at qb ? it couldnt' hurta ny !
7826,haha i would like to see that acgually .
7827,"the saints don't allow their cheerleaderst o dine with players , so securing a qb spot would open up a world of dining that most find an incwntive !"
7828,i think a lot of teasm have rules around players interacting with cheerleade4s .
7829,"well , with the average gameplay time of 11 kinutes , what does it really matter ?"
7830,good talking to you !
7831,hi . are you into the los angelws chargers ?
7832,i am not really into football in general . how about you ?
7833,bo . but the los angeles chargers seem to have good track record . the are the 11th best in defense in the nfl this year .
7834,they also have the best net passer rating for 2018 along with the chifs .
7835,"huh , i did not know that . and apparnetly tehy alsos cor e2 . 6 points per drive ."
7836,net passer rating is a relibale litm8s test for super bolw caliber teams so they are super bowl contenders .
7837,"yes , i think that they are . they are tied with the chiefs in 2018 ."
7838,they also have the seventh best offensive line in the nfl right now
7839,wow . i did not know that . football is alsoc laled soccer in some countries .
7840,wer eally love our football in the us . 14 of the world's 25 biggest stgadiums belong to american college football teams .
7841,yes ! and did you know that th ehighest score ever in a fokotball game occured in1 916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland with a score of 22q0 ? !
7842,i wonder wat happened to make the score so bad !
7843,"i have no icea . i wish i knew how the score coild get so hihg . they must have changed the rules since then . i have never ehard of gaelic football , have you ?"
7844,"no , i have not heard of gqaelic football though i have hszard of australian football . i think it's th esame as american football but the ball is larger ."
7845,and then ther eis rubty football . they have a rugby league or rugby union . so many different versions of football . it makes my ehad spin .
7846,football certainly ahs come a long way . it's crazy teh technology yhat is used in american football these days .
7847,i thin kit is awesome that forme rpatriots runningback gfeenellis never fumbled teh football at all durin ghis whole career .
7848,that is maaszing . some football playes are just so talented . brad johnson k a superbowl winning quarterback has thrown a 6ouchdown paas to himself .
7849,wow . has it that possible ? and the average nflg mae ahs only 11 minutes of luveg ameplay .
7850,"i am not sure how it's possible . and yeah , there isn't a lot of gamep.ay which is probably why i ma not intof ootball ."
7851,"yeah , me too . some of the rules seem crazy t me . hey , it has been great . thanks ."
7852,i still have so much to learn about the nfl .
7853,do you fillow football ? college or nfl ?
7854,"i follow both actually , i lovet e eagles and ducks !"
7855,the ducks are oregon ? i've heard that iowa painted th elocker room for vsitors pink .
7856,yes ! i have heard that too ! i also heard 14 of the 25 biggest stadiums im the world are for college ootball !
7857,there's som eserious mon4ey in college ball . i wonder whether there will everb e a women's version of the game .
7858,i doubt it would ever catch on tio be h0nest . even men shigh school stadiums can cost up to 60 million to build !
7859,"that's true . there has to be money available to build the stadium . maybe they would include women on them en's teams , make it coed ."
7860,"that is a good ;oitn , but who knows if there is a makret . snoop dogg wrote the fight song for his son's high school football team"
7861,snoop is a man with many talents . i think it's funny that an nfl gas only 11 minutes of live gameplay . lots of time cor dcommetcials .
7862,it sure does since the games are 3 hours long !
7863,it's interesting that engineers make more during their careerse that pro athletes . i guess longevity pays well .
7864,"that really is interesting , they put their body on the line for that too , just to get paid sol ittle"
7865,that's the issuw with including women in the game . women would get badly hurt by men . would viewers accept that ?
7866,i do not think so
7867,i wonder whether they woudl elt men become cheerleaders . i know college has male cheerleaders .
7868,"i think they should ! i know saints cheerleaders annot eat where h eplayers do , which is odd !"
7869,i guess it's to discourage romantic relat9onships .
7870,"i suppose so , that is still odd to me though . lile , thy can talk to who they want !"
7871,maybe they ad problems i the past .
7872,"i think so , that is al li cxa think of !"
7873,"i think it's odd that esonw on a nemmy for the yellow line showing the first down . it's a good addition to the show , but na emmy ?"
7874,"it hink that ay be overkill , but it ce5tainly is na advancement"
7875,"hi , how are you ?"
7876,"i ma well , how are you ?"
7877,"i am doing very well , are you into football at all ?"
7878,i am into football . i can't wiat fort oday's games . i am from chicago so i am a h7ge bears fan .
7879,"i am an eagels fan myself , sorry about parkey . apparently most nflp games have abou t11 minutes of gametime !"
7880,"i now . gpod luck today ! saints will be a tough one . . . baker mayfield , quartebrack , university of oklaho,a , once considered quitting football to pursue fulltime competitive gaming , nd claims to be able to beat anyone at the univbersity of okalhoma oneonone in hlao 3 ."
7881,"i believe that , he is good at pretty much anyhting he does , qbs are specual , i know alex smith is very smart !"
7882,i had no idea alex smith took that amny ap classes . kind of mind boggling . . .
7883,"it really ks , doing that a sanyone is spcial , but zs an athlete , even crazier !"
7884,"yeah ! the circular hudele used in todays ametican football wss vreated by paul d . hubbard , a deaf quarterback , so the other team could not read hi shand sigals . i ahd no clue !"
7885,"i wonder how good he was as a deaf quarterback , it might help in opposing stzdiums !"
7886,yeah . never tnough tof hat before . i believe it would be a benefit . . . not sure how the speaker would work though . l .
7887,"that is true , and a lt of people woule neex sign language . but accommodation is alwas healthy i think , i am glad hes had an impact on the game"
7888,"ift he speaier stops with 1 5seconds on the play clock , sign language could extedn that time . i think you found a loophole !"
7889,"i did not think of that , they definitely use hand signls normally ,b ut maybe that is easier to intercept"
7890,is kellna moore still in the nfl ? kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl
7891,"i think he is , maybe on teh panthers ? i know michael vick and maybe steve young were left handed"
7892,"yeah . tua , alabama qb is too , . the nfl has hnow ritten rule against female players ; women would in fact be allowed if they met the leagues' eligibility requirements ."
7893,i wonder if maybe theyc ould be a kicker or a punter ?
7894,"nfl uses tracking chips embedded in playters shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
7895,"i have mever seen those stats prese4nted during games , that would be very interesting to me !"
7896,are you a football fan ? i thnk it's one of the best sports to watch .
7897,"hey ! i watch soemtimes , but not deally often . i was surprised that an average jfl game is about 11 minites of live gameplay . it's not a lot"
7898,yes when you break down the actual game action it iss urprising . they have to make room for all htose commercials !
7899,"true . what's your favorite tea, ?"
7900,"i'm a fan of the phialdelphia eagles , it's be3en a fun few years for us reently ."
7901,good to know . i was wondering maybr you are fan of university of ioa and can explain why locker roo9m for visiting team is pink lol because i have no idea lol
7902,i guess tehy think it would be throw the other 6team off thei game somerhow . i don't think the colorw ould bother me if i was a player .
7903,me too actually . i don't think its' big . noise could be a problem ; but color is just color .
7904,maybe the georgia tech visiting team locker room was pinted pink because tnhey beat a team 2220 .
7905,"honestly , i cannot imagine this score . 2220 is really a lot . it was over centry ago , but still . . ."
7906,if taht happenedt oday i think it would be on sportscenter for months .
7907,"asolutely . i didn't know taht there isn't written rule atwinst femal eplayers . i knoa there some requirements , vut i'm wondering what kind of requirements it could be . any idea ?"
7908,the only requirements htat i can think of are the regulations for how long out of college they have to be to play in the nfl . i believe they cannot declare for hte d5aft until junior year or a certain age .
7909,"ok , but why does it make problem tor potential femkale players ?"
7910,i do not know the reasoning behind femalwe players . my best guess would b that since they are generally mslaler in stature they don;'t want femwles to be injured when tetting tackled . some football playerx can weigh over 300 pouns .
7911,"true . well , anyway i udnerstand reason of traditi0n . this is male sp0ort , bur wondering about it since i've read about possbility of female players . i've also read that average lifetime earnings of an enginner is higher thab the avrrage lifetime earnings of nfl player . t's surprize for me . i was sure they make a lot . . ."
7912,tue very best players do make a lot but there a lot of players who do not have long careers . i beieve that probably drives the average down a lot .
7913,right . average is just average . you are right . every time i read about some sort of strange facts or traditiolns . pink room is oen . there is another . new odrleans hceerldaders are forbidden from eating in the saem place as any nfl player . it sounds stupid
7914,the nfl teams usually have a fraterniza5ion clause for their cheerleaders and players . i'm sure it's to protect their organizatio from any messy fa;l ou from relationships .
7915,don't 7ou think itl ooks like old school ? too much old
7916,it does but also at the same time organizations always want to protect themselves fro many potential legal issue s.
7917,do you watch the nfl ?
7918,"yes i watch the nfl from time to time . there's no rule agaihst femal eplayers apparenlty , would you watch hte nfl with females playing ?"
7919,"i a not sure , thy may get hurt right away , what do you think ?"
7920,"i think you could have a female kicker , but i don't know that you could have femal elinebackrs or something like that , but who knows mybe it will happen"
7921,there may be a female kicker i just read about that may be thef irst one . do you wawtch college football ?
7922,i have watched it from time to time l i remem4brh earing about the university of iowa's locker room . teh7 painte dthe opposing team's lockerroom pink lol
7923,"for sure , i like that stadium . the coach was into psychology and read aout yhe pink color . very interestjngr eqd"
7924,"yes i agree . laso interesting that bowlers in the 60s made twice as much as football stars back then , talk about a reversal"
7925,"for sure , a huge reversal ! i would pursue nfl over bowling now"
7926,"ye absolutely ! i laso would pursue being on georgia tech's team versus cumberlands , especially after seeing that georgia tech beat thsm 232 to 0 lol"
7927,"i feel bad for the other team , i would have quit after 1000 lol !"
7928,haha i agree with you ! riverwatch football on tv though ? apparently espn won an emmy for creating the first down yellowl ine on tv
7929,i love thuat yelow hting on the field . i used to think it was a real thing as a kid while wawtching tv and never understood how they did it lol
7930,haha tyhat's funny ! it's definitely uswful . did you hear ano8t how the circular huddle got started by the way ?
7931,"i think from a deqf quarterback , is that right ?"
7932,"yup , he would use the huddle to cover up his ahnd signals , that way thre 9ther team couldn't see what he was doing"
7933,"that is smart , you coud easily pick those singals up if there were no huddle . was it paul hubbar d?"
7934,i'm not sure qctuall .b t that sounds like it coul dbe him . do you follow alex smith by the wy ? you thin khe's any good
7935,"he was good , then he got hurt really bade , poor guy . what do you think ?"
7936,"yeah i felt bad he got hurt , but he was so smart , he almost got his master's degr3ee bsck whne he was in college and he passed out of a lot of college classe from when he as in high school"
7937,he was definitely a smart guy hwo became the 1 pick . goor chatting with you !
7938,who is your favorite quarterback ? it is an offensive position in american football .
7939,i don't really have one . although i think it's cool kellan moore is the only left handed qb !
7940,he is one of my favorites of the 32 teams in the nfl .
7941,yes he iz . ruswsel wi.son is great too and he is still undera n mlb contract .
7942,russell is talented . i hope he makes it to the super bowl which is always the first sunday of february .
7943,yes me too . he has hee ntuhere before . in his mlb contract he was traded to the ny yankees in 2018 .
7944,i wonder how a woman woudl size up agaisnt him in the nfl . women can play as long as they meet eligibility requurements .
7945,"i think she would get killed honestly . high school football is really big in texas . one high school even as a football stadium that seats 18 , 000 eople ."
7946,texans get really involved in football .l crazy to think it's just a matter of kicking a ball to score a goal .
7947,ha ha are you thinking of socer ? there js kicking involved in football but it's not that primary way to score a touchdown .
7948,"foot ball goes by many names suhc as soccer , gridiron football , gaelic football , and rufby fooytball ."
7949,y4s many sports are referred to a sfootball . but gridiron football is the biggest variation in america . 14 of the worpds 25 largest stdiums belong to american college football teams .
7950,howlers used to make twice as much as footzblers . somehow they lost the edge !
7951,wow . that is very surprsing . there has also only been one quarterback to throw a touchdown pass to himself and that is bradj ohnson .
7952,that's a cool thihg to be know mnfor ! i wonder how much of th3 1q1 minutes of game plwy itt ook for hij to do that !
7953,indeed . yes probably just a few seconds lol . doug williams and russell 3wilson are the only 2 african american quarterbacms to win a super bowl ! my boy vikc didn't gey his chance !
7954,he should have stayed away from the dogs . that still makes me sadc htat he waas hurting innocewnt animals .
7955,"terrible really . now that's how he is remembered . speaking of dogs , snoop dogg wrote a fight song fo rhis sons high school football team !"
7956,his song is actually very talented . he could p4oabbly beat the crushing record of 222q0b etween georgia tech and cu7mberland in q1916 .
7957,"yes he would defimitelyg ivde the players encouragement . those big flags in the stadium cost 50 , 00o0 to make ! well it was nice talking with you !"
7958,nice meetimg you !
7959,hi there are you interested in football ?
7960,"i liek the 4avens quite a bit , our defense has been teh second besf in the nfl this year in points allowed ;er drive ."
7961,"i heard it was only 1 . 6 points per drive , whihc forces the other tesm to a three and out qite a bit !"
7962,definitely . matt judoin is a big reason for that he has been having a great year at outside linebacker .
7963,definitwly 3 sacks and 5 tackles is nothing to shake your head at !
7964,"the texans have a great pasws rush as well jj watt and jadeveon clouwney are a tough pair ,"
7965,"i've been following baker mayfield as well this year , since it is his rookie season he's been doing well with a 71 percent completion rate !"
7966,yes he may hav etrouble with sacks when they play houston the housyon secondary is 11th best .
7967,"yes ,f or sure . but even if he has to sit in the pocket , that won't hurt houstonh e isn't as go9d when he waits to throw the ball ."
7968,7es teh jaguars defense is nothing to be afraid od anymore . they are given up almost 4 more points pr gwme than expectee .
7969,i think it is intetesting how they're able to track all of this data . did youy kmow there are trackin gchils in the shoulder pads of the players to gater that type or data ?
7970,yes and in the foo5balp too ! probably makes it easier to monitor the game .
7971,"well when you can trac kvelocity , rotation , ball speed , and ,ocatio nit definitely helps to monitor all that inform,ation !"
7972,yes with only 11 minute sof gameplay per game it guives the announcers stuff tot alk about .
7973,which is pretty crazy kind of like how there's actually no rule against a female playing the nfl too . i wonder how long kt will be before a girl gets signed !
7974,i think a girl could be a kicker thougfh maybe not flr the saints tehy wonte ven let thejr cheerleaders eat at the same restaurants as the players !
7975,"and if ac heerleader is somewhere , and player comes in later , hte ceerleader has to l3ave ! that seems unfair if they were there first ."
7976,abzolut3ly ! i would tathe rbe ane ngineer than play football zanyway you make more money
7977,i kmow more than an nfl or mlb player ! that's crazy !
7978,i think it is because tbeir careers are longer less injuries !
7979,so true ! the lifespan of an nfl career isn't terribly long .
7980,yes unles syou are tom brady leadin ghis team at quarterback he has way outlasted mosr players .
7981,veryt rue and he wasn't even allowed to start in high school whwn his team couldn't even score a touchdown !
7982,his high school coach must regret that ! of course some players do both alex smith was working oj his master's degree hwen he got drafted .
7983,"that's so awesome hen nfl players value their education . i mean , alex came in as a junior because he took so many ap tests !"
7984,absolutely . i do like that all types can play footbhall the huddle was created for a deaf quarterbqack
7985,ehllo . are you familiar with the nfl ? it has 32 professional football teams .
7986,"ye s, my local team is the sints . i do not follow regularly , but i am always intrigued by how tech has infiltrated the ga,e . do you know the nvl has tracking chips in the shoulder padst o rexord every plahyers move ?"
7987,"yes , i do . the coaches use technologyb ecause they need to track ball speed , rotation , etc . more accurately ."
7988,"what i also find interesting is some of th3 superstitions and quirky rules . for my saints , thec heerelader cannot eaf in teh same restaurant with any nfl player , even if they were thede first ! ! !"
7989,"that is not fair . if the hceerelqder are at the restaurant first , the players shoul dleave ."
7990,i am mot sure how thatc ame to be . did you hear about the call against packers linebacker rregarding roughing the quarterback ?
7991,"yes , i heard . what do you think about it ?"
7992,i am not swure howt he refs can consistently make hte call ? hjtting tb eqb in the head or below th eknee is prohibited and easy to observe . but the ruls that says the defender canno tland om a b with most or all of body weigh t! how do you call that ? ?
7993,"do you know thay paul hubbard , a deaf quarterback , stwartedt je circular yuddle in football ?"
7994,i did not . what was the reason behind it ?
7995,he did not 2ant the other team to read his hand signals .
7996,"ahh . the tradition lives on . today , quarterabcks have razrios in their helmets to get calls fro mthe coaches . did you know that in high school , tom brady was a jv backup qb ? you woul denver believe that considering hjs nfl record ! !"
7997,"he did not get to play at high school since he was only a backup . yet , he won five super bowl championships ."
7998,do you follow collegiate foo6ball ?
7999,i used tl . i have no time now . i almost prefer collegiate yo professional football .
8000,"8 have had season tickets tom y lsu tigers fo rjust ov4r 30 years ! even collegiafe footblal has skme unusual rituals . did you know the university o fiowa locker room for tbe visiting team is painted pink ? you have to wonder if it is for humiliation , intimidation , or a bit of both ?"
8001,"i think it is both . alex smigh , redskins q b, took so many ap tests at high school that he received his bach3lor's degree in two years ."
8002,htat i samazing considerking how many players opt out of completing their degree to enter the nfl draft .
8003,"apparently , kellan moore is the knly left handed quarteback in the nfl ."
8004,"i inow beingl eft handed can be advnatageous in baseball , but is it in football ? during the playoffx , the nfl has a female referee . do you tbink there will ever ve female nfl players ?"
8005,i don't know . the fnl hyaz no writte nrule against f3mlae players nut ic an imagine that it is hard to meet the league's eligibility requirements . i've got to run . nice chatting with y0u .
8006,same here . hopefully they can clarify the roughing the passer rule . its kinda hard to see how a 250300 pound rusher cannot put most of his body weigh tinto rushing the pasdse r?
8007,do youl ike the nfl ?
8008,i like to watch it sometimes . how bout you ?
8009,i watch it very year on sunday .
8010,oh wow good for you . did you know there is no written oaw against gemales playing in the nfl
8011,"yeah , i' mnot surprise . qlso the game play is only 11 minutes ."
8012,that iss urprising . ig usually takes like 3 hours lol just to watch 11 min
8013,hiakrious . it is a bunch oir people standing around .
8014,i hear the nfl also puts chips on their players and on the football as well
8015,"yeah , i' not sure what they do with that data , what do you think ?"
8016,"maybe stats , o rtraining purposes ?"
8017,"yeah , i would think . did you knowa espn won an emmy for the first down line ?"
8018,that digital first down lien is very helpful for people at home and watching on the sreen ! ythat is awesomje .
8019,i like it too . same with the thing taht follows the puck in hockey .
8020,that one is super helpful ! those pucks moce so fast !
8021,"yeah , did they win ab emmg for taht too ?"
8022,"i have no clue , i enjoy hockey more than football though lol more game time lol"
8023,"yeah , th3ere can be more action in those games . thatf is for sure ."
8024,yeah seruiously . in teh 60's top bowlers made more mohney rhan football players lol
8025,"that is pretty cool . reminds me oft he bill murray bowling moie kingpin . well , nice chatting with you !"
8026,great chatting with a .
8027,take it easy .
8028,do you like dqance ?
8029,"hey there , yes i do dance from time to time , what do you think the giants shoudl do for thweir 2 draft pick thiough ?"
8030,"i'm not sure ! i don't real,yw atch baseball . what do you think ? i think that p5ofesskonal balet dancers are athletic in a way . . . they can go throuvh four pairs of pointe zoes in a week ."
8031,"awell that is a lot of shoes haha , and teh giants are actually a football team , they did horribly last year so they are getting the 2 pick this year , i'm just wondering who they are going to pick"
8032,"ah , thouhgt you eere 6alking about the sf giants . a lot of fotball players do ballet right ?"
8033,i'm not sure do they ? i do know tyhat on eteam painted the visiting team's locker room pink so maybe they do ? haha
8034,"haha . well i have heard that they do it for physical training . another perso njwho i would not have expcted to do ballet was tupac , the rapper ."
8035,"ya i didn't expect that , nor did i expect htat top bowlers made twice as muchy as top football players back in the 1960s"
8036,"wow , tha tis interesting . around that time bruce lee was perf9rming in a cha cha championship . he won ."
8037,"ahha that is impressive , he probably dominated , kinf of like georgia tech when they beat cumberland 2220 hha"
8038,"wow , wonder what happened there . when was that ?"
8039,"ya that wasb ack in 916 , i6 was the highes scoring football game ever"
8040,"oh , so i guess there is no tv coverage of it since it waz so long ago . espeaking of tv , do you watch the simpsons ? bart appears in all episodes but one andh e isn't even mentioned in that one .?"
8041,"wow i didn'tk now that , did you know that womewn could play for the jnfl ? there is no actual rule against it"
8042,i wonder ir we will ever see one . i heard about a woma nkicker on tv . i don't usually watchg the news but i like comrdies like that 70s shows . they tried to remake that verbatim in uk and it was cancelled quickly .
8043,"oh ya i liked that show , and ya i think htat qomen could play , the average nflg am eonly has about 11 mins of actual gameplay so it doesn't 5ake that much endurance"
8044,"yeah maybe that is why football doesn't hold my attention . i l.ike cartoons better , like pokemon . i've be4en watching since i was a ki and there habe been 750 episodes ."
8045,"oh ya i love pokemon , i saw it as a ki debfore i became an engineer , at least as an enginner though i w2ill make more over my lifetime than the average nfl pklayer haha"
8046,intdresting ! plus i think engineers re better at managing their money .
8047,"yup thats it , plusx nfl players only paly for a lkmited numbetr of years , that definitely affects it"
8048,i hace to get into football more though . it looks so cool on htv . luckily we don't have to watch it in monohrome anymore !
8049,i like it when the police have fun n local media . like agfter the cleveland browns got ' robbed ' by the officials .
8050,"yeah , ey declsared that a ' robbery ' warrant had been issued .a nd just to make sue , thet clarifjed that it sas a joke ."
8051,"yes . even though the call wasc lse the browns still had an 8 point lead at the yime , they could have still won ."
8052,a few plays later there was anothedr controv3rsial call .
8053,yes and considering htat it was a home game it is surprising tha tthe officials did that .
8054,the officials decided thgat hyde had come up tol short .
8055,yes that is a shame fore the browns but that is how it goes in the nfl . only 6 teams from each conference cang o to the playoffs .
8056,after that th ebrowns still had an eight point lead but could not keep the raiders from scoring a touchdown .
8057,"yes so it was nat8ral tha they lost . ity was almost a given thayt he patriots would end u0 in rhe su8per bowl again , held on the first sunhday in february ."
8058,"yeh , i don't watch football but i did watch the super bowl . an average nfl game only has 11 minu5es of live gameplay . maybe that's why it dkesn't hold my attention ."
8059,"yes , but it is iner4sting how much technology is in the game now . they have tracking chips inside the shoulder pads and helmets ."
8060,the superimposed line that espn created is pretty neat too . they got an emmy for it .
8061,"that is pretty crazy . i juwst can't wait to se4 what the ratings do if there ever is a wkman player it sallowed in the nfl , just has never happened ."
8062,"yeah even if a woman player meets the requirements i wonder if they'd fin anohter way to keep her from playing . i know that players are more im0portant to the nfl than cheerleaders but it still seems sexist how the saints cheelreaders need to leave an establishment even if they are already eating there , if saints players come in and want to eat there ."
8063,"yes that is very sexist . i don't think it is likely that a woman will become a quarterback , but i could certainly see one being t6he kic,er ."
8064,"yeah , that makes sense . i am female , though i don't kno wif i would even want to b ea football player . i'd rather be an engineer , as they make more than t6h eaverage nfl player on average , ov4r a lifetime ."
8065,absolutely . mufh lrss hcance of injury ! there are some people who can do both alex smith was working onh is master's degree when he became the number one pick in the draft .
8066,"yeah , it'z cool that he was such a good student nd had a backup plan . i wonder if he wqs ont he footbalo team in high school . if he was , how did he find so much time to take so many ap tests that he enterdd university7 as a junuipor ? !"
8067,that is a good question . its so funny that tom brady was never even allokwed to play in high school even though his tezam never won a game or scored at ouchdown !
8068,"haha , that is funny . do you think that gaming is a better career ? baker mayfield was going to quit footballt o pursue a full time gaming caree r."
8069,that s pretty crazy ! its certainly safer !
8070,ehllo how are you today ?
8071,"great . are you an nfl footbakl fan , and do you follow qabs like ther edskins' kirk cousins , by any chance ?"
8072,hello i am a football fan . i don't know much about kirk cousins though .
8073,"zeens cousins ckntract deal with the redskins did not go wel l, for eityer qb or team , , and he became ' expendable ' as they say . wbat does that eman , really ?"
8074,that's interestin g. not really sure what that means hough . did you know the nfl has now ritten rule against qomen playing ?
8075,"i've heard that . thought contracts were w3rittgen rules .s ometimes palyers get franchised or tagged . fellow players often weigh in o ntalk shows , too . did you know cousins wanted about 30 deal to stay with redskins ?"
8076,i did not know 6hat . i sa wthe average football game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
8077,interesting . must mean lots of minutes for commercials . . ?
8078,i would think so . the nfl uses tracking ch9ips embedded in the players sh0oudler pads .
8079,"yws . i understand that's to record a plazyer's every move on he field . they're inside footballs , too ."
8080,yep pretty much . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is actually higher tha nthe average nfl player .
8081,that's an interestingf act . do you attribute that to players' careerneding ijuries ?
8082,quite possilby . not too sure o nthat on e.
8083,"sometimes criticism can help end a player's career , too . for example , redskins szfety , deangelo hall made som econtroversial statemnets about his thenqb , cousins , when a guest analyst on espn ."
8084,wow did not know that . the nfl consists of 32 teams .
8085,"yes . each team is run by a front office . fyi : hall wants to become a frontoffice employe4 for the redskiins , and already sounds like one , some peopl esay ."
8086,interesting . who is your fzvorite football team ?
8087,followed the redskins ; sorry to see the chiefs take them out of super bowl contention .
8088,i'm a bengals fan . just hoping we can make it to the playoffs this year .
8089,sometimes wonder if fans outside the us understand our versiob of football .
8090,it was good talking to you !
8091,do you like or follow the nfl ?
8092,hi
8093,do you like watching footblsl ?
8094,"sometimes , algough it gets loud in my hous4"
8095,do you have a favorite tewm ?
8096,"panthers are my kids so i have to go with them , how about you ?"
8097,"im from new england so the patriots ,"
8098,"cool . i've been reading up on some things i didn' tknow about , some trivia an dstuff like what the different 'football sports ar4 called in different kuntries ."
8099,"cool , can you share some of those facts with me ! i sure want to learn today"
8100,"sure thing ! like in england , its called foo6bapl but in usa we call it skccer . its not the same play only call3ed by same name ."
8101,"i kove soccer and yeh its not th esame thing , two totally diferent sports ,"
8102,"and like in australia football is called rugby football ! not sure what or ifc there is a difference in play though ,d o you ?"
8103,"th erules are different yeah , i like football better though , i dont really understand rugby"
8104,"yeah , too ! lol ! one thing am glad about is espn , they real,y do ab ang upo job with that yellow line"
8105,"that yellow line has mwde the game easier to understand , i like it a lot do you think espn deserved the emmy because of it ?"
8106,"oh yeah ! they shouod have gotten a noble for it , kt was genius !"
8107,"i share the sae opinion , it might see mlike a small thing but it changrdh ow we view the game ,"
8108,"no doubt ! such a small thing too , bu toh so worth it for fans or even nonfans to help in learning the game ."
8109,"i wish i was as gooed as benjarvus green ellis , i would win so much money"
8110,"funny you should mention that , i also read in my trivia this ; that the lifetjme earning of an engineer is higher than the average earnings of a nnfl player ! wow !"
8111,"i guess i have t bsdiome an negineer then lol , anyway nice chat , a lot of usefu info about the ebautiful mae of football ."
8112,heyt here ! do you like football at all ?
8113,"good evening , yes , i do like football . don't hate me , butm y favorite team is the patriots !"
8114,"poh nice ! haha , i don't hate yoy ! isn't to mbrady a patriot ?"
8115,"yeah , the goat is the quarterback for the patriots ."
8116,haha .; what does goat mean ?
8117,"greatest of allyt ime ! which by many , he is considered the beat quarterback , me included . lol"
8118,"oh ! yeah i hear a lot about him ! i've heard that he reached 1 , 000 career rushign yards . what does that mean ?"
8119,"he';s awesom e, that's what it means . basically he'll run the baol as well as throw the passes ."
8120,"it's kind of weird to me , that the word footbzll , can mean soccer or footbwll , depending on where a person is in hte world ."
8121,"i know , it's confusing . but to me ootball isf ootball and soccer is not football at all . lol"
8122,same ! here is a fun facdt : in hte 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top footabll stars ! bowling isn't anywhere as popular as football . i guess it fell out of favor .
8123,"yes , it has . i lik4e to twke the kids bowling everyn ow and then , and i know there is a professional circuit for bowling , but i don't fhink of itt hat 2way . just a kid's game to me ."
8124,i bet you can fantasyd rwft nowling . i mean people draft everything else . did you know that fkrmer patriots rbb enjarvus greenellis has never fumbpled the ball in his nfl career ?
8125,"yes , i had read about him , i can't 8imagin ethe pressure he must have flst to remwin erfec t."
8126,i know ! mess up just one time and that record is gone !
8127,k ciuldn'5 habe did it 2
8128,"me neither i am a horrible footbgall player ! cumberland must have been a team full of peoplel ike me when they lost 2202 to georgia tech , which happens to be the highest score ever in a football game ."
8129,"that's pitiful ! that wouldnt' happen today , i don't thjnk . the last superbowl i watched was the lowest scoring ever ."
8130,"yeah that game was way back in 1916 . i didn't even know football was that old . shouldn't how lo0gn it's been around solidify that it is football , and soccer is soccer ! how is the wordl not on the same pae about htis ! ? it's kind of crazy ."
8131,i agree with you !
8132,": , well , hey it was really nice talking to you !"
8133,"nice chatting with yoh ae well , have a good night !"
8134,do you like football ?
8135,football ? the game is insanely popular ! who does not like the football ? everyone plays it around this world .
8136,i dont think football is that popular othert han in the states ! ! ! maybe you are thinking of soccer ?
8137,"ah , yes , the soccer ! that is the word that is used to call it in the america . thank you . yes , i like tnhe sccer . the other sport , the football , used much in the us . yes ."
8138,"soccer is a geaet sport i also like it , so you like america fotball as3well ?"
8139,i have not sse nthe football american except on the tv and then only wit ha friend whod id not explain it to me .
8140,"wel its a great game , you should watch it so,e time im sure you will love it , there are 32 teams and two divis8ions"
8141,"ok , that is many teams . i might not be able to collow all of them . what is the bexsg team right now ?"
8142,"the patriots is the ebst team , they won the last superbolw wich would be like the champions league in comparisson to soccer"
8143,"i see . the patriots are very good at kickin gthe ball , and throwing it from time to time . everybody must love the patriots . such an american name !"
8144,"many people hate them as well because they tend to win all th3 time , i love them personally"
8145,"i think that winning makes you a winner , and people should love winners , especailly the american people ?"
8146,yeah winning is great ! so the most important position in the gzme is filled by thd qb
8147,the qb ? the quarterback ? it soinds like ad ifficult and dangerous job .
8148,"yeah the quarterback , qb is the abbriviation , the are part of every offensive play so yah , really importnat job the one they do"
8149,the qb should get paid the most thne because they have to deal with the ball all tue time . it is w heavy burden for one person .
8150,"in most teams they are , so tom brady , a leyend of hte game , used to be bench in his h8igh school team , his team would lose so many game and the coach wouldnt start himn"
8151,he was not old enough to bear the qb burden . it is hard for one whi is youn . he needed to age to thd eright age for carryin gthe burden of the qb .
8152,"yeah maybe he wasn tgood enough back the nor he had a terriblec oacu ,"
8153,taht is a p0ssibility . i have come to learn many things this chat . thank you the chat . thank you ve4ry much the chat .
8154,"there are a lot more inteesting facts about the game , hope you watch it ome day ."
8155,"hey hter e, do you watch nfl ?"
8156,"yes , i used to live in kansas city and had sesson tickets to the chiefs for 10 years before getting transferred to the east coast . i enjoy watching thde nfl a lot ."
8157,nixe . did you kno wwomen can play too if tuey make te cut ?
8158,"no that surprised me , thoug hperhaps if the codified that rupe they'd be in some legal problems . i coild see a woma kickesr , are you fan of the nfl ?"
8159,not really but watch it sometimes . after all 6he gameplay is only 11 minutes
8160,"yes , tyat surprisedm e , but i gues swith the violent contact and injuries that may be a good thing and it let the etorks see ,ore advertising time . i live near boston now and was humored to see tom brady wqs a backup in highschool for a team that lost all their games and didn't score . he's had a itgle more success 0out here ."
8161,oh for sure he has come a long way . have you heard of alex smiht ?
8162,"yes , i idn't know he was so smart . i still follow the chiefs every week and he tutored patric kmahomes last year , a class guy though his broken leg wa spainful fo watch this year . i was surprised that the avrae engineer makea more than th eaverage nfl pr mlb player , i guess there's a lot of shortc arrers to bring the average down ."
8163,yeah . do you know who invented the circulwr huddle and how it came abou t?
8164,"yes , i googled it and it was paul hubbard in 1892 , interestin being deaf . now the coaches all cover they mouths and huddle to keep the othe rteam from lipreading the signals . i got a grad degree at iowa , i didn't know then the visiting locker room wa pinjk , that kinx of funny ."
8165,"i know . i realply wonder why that is , if it serves a purpose or has a reason behind it"
8166,"seems like a feminizing act i guess o rjust a distraction from the game preparati9n . i thought the new orleans satints were a little rough on their cheerleaderes , can't dune with a player and have to leave midmeal is one shows up at their restwaurant5 , that seems a little one sideda nd sexist ."
8167,"i really agree with you there , i do not see a po9nt in that rule at all . they can play in the game if they qualify and yet cannot eat in the same plac as other players ."
8168,"maybe it was designed to make it difficult to date ? no sense to me . i do travel to europe a lot , funny they consider footvall what we consider sovcer , but i was surprised how many flavor of football there are besides thos to , australian , gaelic , etc ."
8169,yeah i guesx each country has their own concept of what constituted footall . the nfl guys do not seem to make much money though .
8170,"less than an engineer on average lifetime , i kno . i see where as i mentioned 0atrick mahomas of the chiefs is set to resign for 200 million , maybe that wil. rbifn the average up ."
8171,"could be , i read an article abvout a nfl player who teaches during the off season to mkae ends meet"
8172,"back when i was in kc they said in the 1960's all the players had summer jobs , like will lnaier the big linebacker delivered refrigerators . o think with the increased salary they can train year round wbich is good given the beating their bodies take ."
8173,yeah exactly . and now trhey place chips on their padding go track movements and such .
8174,"i read thata nd wondered about that . i wasn't sure to what end they ekbedded the chip 9n the sholder pads , did that make any sense to your , do you see a reason ? i see wahy thewy track the ball for first down and out of bounds or touchdowns kind of things ."
8175,well nowaydas they can maybe track movement and also impact and make better clothing and helmets to protect them . just an opinion . nice chatting with you
8176,hi how are you ? i have talked about football quit ea bit today . do you like folotball
8177,"ello , i love watching football actually , how about you ?"
8178,id ont watch football much . i try to watch the super bowl .
8179,"yea the superbowl ks awesome . i like college football , my alma mater is the university of iowa hawkeyes , they paint their opponents locker room pink"
8180,why do they do that ? what would thatd o ?
8181,they do that becayude pink is a calmng colo rand they try to relax the other tea mbefore they play them . it is straight psychology 101 .
8182,does it worjk ? does iowa win a lot at home ?
8183,"they actually do . ive only been to a few games they have lost at home . they tend to beat ranked opponnets pretty easilh there lije michigan and ohio state , crazy"
8184,i guess the other teams dhould start painting the visito5 lockler room pinkm .l ol
8185,"right , i wonderr why ni other tams do it . it works obviously lol . do you have qf avorite quarterback"
8186,i dont . i guess i liked joe montanaa nd steve young . they were great .
8187,"for sure , hall of famer sback to back was awesome for the 49ers . i liked alex smith , he wa stoo a 49er , suped smar6t guy also"
8188,"he was very bright . did quite well in high school nad colelge , i hear ."
8189,"yep , he went into college aw a junior i think and then got his masters before coming the number 1 pidk overall"
8190,that is amazing . i wish more football playefs were that academically oriented .
8191,right ! you only hear of the bad things happrning with players and bot the genius side f some of the players .
8192,"yes , i think that the sport calls for a ;it of hard wkork and discipline . that can be app.lied in hte classroom ."
8193,"for sure . i like benjarvus grwen ellis because he took smarts to the game of football , he never fumbled in his career once !"
8194,"does he have giant hands , hands like steam shovels ? or the grip of as mighty warrior ? wha is his scret ? anyway , grrat cha t!"
8195,"something i dont know what it is lol , he needs to teach a cl8nic . have a great weekend !"
8196,"you too . have a noce weekend ! talk to benjarvus , and pitch the idea of a clinic to hjim ."
8197,"for ure , ill include you also !"
8198,he7 there ! are you a fan of hte nfl ? i am a nears fan . hard to believe i love a sport sop much that only has 11 minute sof gameplay !
8199,i'm a giants fan buta lso follow the all 32 nfl teams to a degree
8200,"nice ! saquon looks like he will be a star . football has come a long way in general . only about 6 0years ago , top bowlers amde double the amount of top ootball players !"
8201,"that's pretty crazy , the first nfl playoff game was played ona n 80 yard long djirtf ield inside chicago"
8202,"inside a hockey stadium ,r ight ? wild !"
8203,"yea , i believe it was ghe chicago blackhawks stadium"
8204,veey ool . i love the subtel gamesmanship thatg oes o nin football like iowa painting the visiting locker room .
8205,that's pretty crazy . did you know since 1999 the qb with the most wins in the browns' stadium is ben roethlisberger ?
8206,"haha , that is hilarious . the brownd are almost as bad as cumberland university . tehy once lost 222 0to georgia tech q"
8207,that is pretty awf8l . pparentoy the only rocket scientistc oaching int he nfl is matt parrcia
8208,"wow , qould thibnk he should be a better coach ! some guys are smart lik ealex smith . he had so much ap credit he was able to enroll in college a sa high school junior ."
8209,aled msith is really smart . speaking of qbs did you know russell wilson is under a mlb ontract for the ny yankees ?
8210,i have heard that before .? h eis actually one of the two african american qbs to win the super bowl . that is really hard to believe .
8211,"yea , they other one to win a supe rbowl was doug williams"
8212,doug willizmw did it for the redskijs . waht do yout hink aboutt he redskins secondary this year wadding orlando scandrick ?
8213,i don't think adding scandrick wil help hte redskins secondary much
8214,"no , i would think they should do something to helpl ou their run defense which was 32nd in the leag8e in 2017 ."
8215,"yea , spending 10 million on scandrick ijs really gonna hurt them trying to improve the run defense"
8216,"he is a tood playue5 , but as their start safetys wearinger tweeted sarcastically , ' we had the 9th ranked pass defense , but we def nsed more consistency in the secondary . '"
8217,"it doen't hlep that cqndrick is already 31 years old , i don't think he has much left in the tank"
8218,nope he probably does not . it was great cuattign with you ! good luck to the goants this year !
8219,aelx smith is no . 11 on the washington redskins .
8220,i read that ! do you watch football ?
8221,"ges , i like the redskisn actuallyh . 200 season ticket holders welcome him to the team ."
8222,cluld you imagine ? the 13year veteran signed a fouryear extension worth 984 million that includes 71 illion in guaranteed money after bering traded from the kansas dity cxhiefs for cornerback kendlal fupler and a thirdroiund pick .
8223,"yes , that is a lot of money . smith had to learn al ot from watching game film ."
8224,do you know if ue is a gopod player ? i think it's odd they name fileds after businesses now .
8225,yes he waz good ! the redskins however havwn't played in th eplayoffs since 2015 !
8226,"oh no ! that makes this sad then , joe hoffmaater said he has had season tickets for 41 years and swore smith would ' galvanize ' the fan base in a way quarterback kirk cousins did not ."
8227,interesting . they also have won only two division titles sincr 2000 .
8228,that is sad . so is this . . the junipero serra higjh school jv football team recorded a histor9cally bad season in which they failed to win a game or even score a touchdown yet tehy never attempted to start their backup quarterback . that backup quarterback they refused to start is 4 time super bowl champion tom braqdy .
8229,"they weren't very good ! alex smith however was really smart in school ., he 5ook so jany ap tests in high sch0ool he entred college as a junior ."
8230,that is smart . not relying just on football !
8231,"definitely , he was able to get his bachelor's fregree i nonly 2 years ."
8232,wow ! a lot og thes ehits seem to be about football ! formert patriots rbb enjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the ootball in his nfl caree r.
8233,cool fact ! did you know the nfl has no writte nruel against female players .
8234,that is cool ! thi bloes me away too . an averag enfl game only has 11 minutes of pive gameplay .
8235,amazinh because they last for hours ! and the plagersm ake millions of dollars .
8236,"thats true ! sports commonly called football in certain places icnlude association football , known a soccer in some countries , ; gridiron football , specifically american football or caadian football , ; australian rules football ; rugby football , eihter rugby league or rugby union , ; and gaelic ootball ."
8237,didn' gtmnow that . but the nighest score evser in a football game was when ga tec hdefeated cumberland 2220 !
8238,thats crazy q espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line represening the firstd own line for amnerican football games .
8239,i like watching many shows on espn ghey make great programming .
8240,did you watch any of the nfl playoffs thid past weekend ?
8241,yes . they go back a long way . the first nfl playoff game was played on an 80 yard field in chicago stadium .
8242,"wo w, i didn't know that . it was too bad they lost ."
8243,ch9icago stadium is the old inoor arena that the chicago blackhawks used to play in .
8244,that's interesting . do you know what the highest scoring game of ftootball ever was ?
8245,in the 2970'sd i remember washington scored over 70 pints against the ny giants .
8246,that's a lot of touchdowns . well it was a college game where georgia won by 222 points !
8247,wow ! i wonder i fthe losing college kept playing footbqall .
8248,right ! i guessa the university of iowa's visiting locker room is pink . that's intimidation for yo8 .
8249,"collegw football is surely popular . of the 25 largest stadiums in te orld , 14 belong toa merican colleges ."
8250,"wow , i did not know that . the nfl has no written rule on women being prohibited from playing ."
8251,the bill shad a female coach atr one tije .
8252,i fdidn't know that . i think i would be cool if a female player mad ea team and excelled . i think it would give hope to generations of young sports fans .
8253,there are some very mart people ivnolved in football . lions head coach matt patricia is a ocket scientiatb y education . he looks like rasputin .
8254,"really , that i sa vfery cool fact . another ild fact is that the average nfl game has only 11 minutds of actual gameplay , the rest is setting up plays and moving down the field ."
8255,i believe that . and the nfl now has tracking chips embeddewd in pads t0o record player movemnet . hopefu.lly that will improve safety . a lot of players get hurt in those eleven minutes .
8256,"yes , i kno wsafety has become a 5op issue lately in the nfl ."
8257,"that'sw hy nick foles gets to qb the eagles , ad not awentz ."
8258,"yeah , i agree with that . well i'm sure it awill be another exfiting superbowl this year ."
8259,i wonder if it will be the eagles against the patriots ?
8260,"i don't think so , but at this point it very well could be . nice talking with you ."
8261,"hllo , do you like football '"
8262,"yes . foobtal, is the team sports which l.alow the player to kick the ball in various degree to the goal ."
8263,is it ? i fdel like its more of a hzdns throwing kinda sprt .
8264,ancient greece and romans played many ball games some of use feet tok ick the bal l.
8265,"thats cool , msybe thzt evolved into soccer ."
8266,yes . nfl player earn higher than otherr players . there was no written rule against female players .
8267,thats interesting . in the 60's top bowelrs made more than football players .
8268,"in october 916 , georgia tech defeated cumber;and 2220 iz the highest score in the history ."
8269,wow thats a fvery high scoring game . what a shame to rthe losing team .
8270,i thin cimberland fans feelp bery upset .
8271,i recently fou7nd out that espn won an emmy for the digital first down lin3 .
8272,it is very interesting .n fl uses tracking chips embeddded in players shoulder pads to record movement in the field .
8273,"yes , they also use it in the footba,l as well ."
8274,"the different variations of fpotball are know as foobtal lcodes . in 20th century , several of the various kinds of footabll grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world ."
8275,"yeah , whic hvariation are you a fan of ?;"
8276,quarterbacsk are members of the offensive team and line up directly behindt he offensive line .
8277,oh thanks for letting me know . i hear there is a former patriots playerw ho never fumbled the ball .
8278,who was that player ?
8279,benjarvus green elis .
8280,supr . the quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive play and is the offensive player that almost always htrows forward passes .
8281,i hear the university of iowa's locker room for the opposing team is painted lpink .
8282,it os very interestin g.
8283,9ts been great chatting with you .
8284,"hi , how are you ?"
8285,i'm doinb great tonibht ! how are you doing ?
8286,"i am doing well , thanks ! do you like football ?"
8287,i usialy watch nfl righ6a round olayofd time . do you like footabll ?
8288,i love it q did you kn9ow iowa's locker room for theirv isitors is pink ?
8289,iowa is trying some sort of mind game . i don't think it work swll or other teams would imitate . how has iowa done at home ? do they win ?
8290,thety are usuawlly a pretty good home team ; they have a tear jerking tradition where they wave to the cancer hospital for kids after the 3rd quarter .
8291,"hey , that's great ! the kids must love that sort of thign . so much mney goes to football . the highest paid across all u . s . depattment of defens eemployees ar4 thre efootball coaches of the service branch teams"
8292,"well if they win 2220 , they deserve it !"
8293,"i guess , but that was back in 1916 . what a gaem . i wojder who scheduled htat one ."
8294,they probavly got fireda fter it if they were from cumberland . oi !
8295,georgia techu should have put jn their cherleafers to make it a fair gaje .
8296,haha ! funny ! 9 would have left early if i was a cumberland player . l.ike a saints cheerleader at dinner if a saints player walk sin . .
8297,it hink that's a silly rule in this day and age .? the cheerleaders don't get oaid much to begin with .
8298,that's sesism ! but there is no rule against them playing in the nfl .
8299,"i c9uld definitely see femsles playing footabll ! tghere is no feeder system thouyh , like college or high school ."
8300,they could work for espn and make up a yellow line . that would win them an emmy !
8301,"an emmy for a line . well , that must have been a weak year for the emmys ."
8302,ha ! i have been saying that ! a hyellow line . . .
8303,"it is so obviou snow , but i guess at the time , it was a breakthrough . did you kow that thosd huge american flags at footbal stadiums weigh 1 , 100 poudns and cos t50 , 00 to make ?"
8304,that's a heavy flag ! nice chatting with you !
8305,"hows' it going , do you f0ollow football ? the eagles were really struggling att he beginning og the season"
8306,"i don't watch football that much . yeah , the eagles have yet to ein two gaems in a row ."
8307,"yea , wentz hasn't been recoverign too wlel fr4om his injury either"
8308,"yeah , he has been struggling with that kn3ee injury for less than a year . they also lost jay ajayi ."
8309,"6he eagles offense has been really struggling , they have a lot of oproblems"
8310,wonder if they will be able to pul lthings together . it seemed like they were coming off a road victory over the giants but they didb't build on thagt .
8311,"yea , it's not good that the eaglesl ost three of the four previous game"
8312,ih aventr' been keeping up with what's going on in football . i'm not too interested . maybe because each game has only about 11 minutes of live gameplay .
8313,it's pretty crazy how many injures the nfl has with only 11 ninutes of gameplay
8314,haah you are3 right ! maybe i would watch more if there were women in the nfl . there are actually no written rules against femsle poayers .
8315,i can see a female p0lce kicker playing since there is no rules against it in the nfl
8316,"yeah i have heard there is one who has potential who is now playing on the men's football team at her university . however , i know gthat players are more important than cheerleaders but it still eems wrong that when saints players entedr an establishment whete cheerleaders are already dining that the cheerleaders have to leave ."
8317,it seem like a very anyiquated rule that saints cheerleader can't be int he same rsestaurant as male players
8318,"yes , i agree . wel l, maybe women are better off bein gengineers anyway because the aberages lifetime earnihngs of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earing as an bfl player ."
8319,"that's pretty crazy , well back in 1960 the top owlers made more than ndfl players"
8320,"yeah , it's surprising how much football popularity has risen . the technology has gotten so much better ss well ."
8321,"yea , esp nwon an emmy for the yellow lins representing the first down"
8322,and there4 are tracking chips in footballs and shoulder pads .
8323,football has come a long way since paul d . hubbqrd invented the circular huddle
8324,and i don' tthink a university football team would lose 2220 this day and age like cumberland did to georgia tech in 1916 .
8325,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
8326,su4prsing that the university of iowa's locker room is completely painted pink
8327,"i reqd that it was hte visitor' locker room that was paitned pink . i wonder if it was supposed to b esome sort of isnult or something , though it's not really , sicne pinkis cool in football these days . football players wear it for reast cance r."
8328,i don't know but maybw it was origijally a girls room . in the 1960's top bowlers mad e2x's the amount of top football stars
8329,i i sinterestin ghow much popularity football has gained since then . i find it interesting too that the technology nhas advanced so much .
8330,"yes , tracking chips inside players shoulder pads record play3ers every move . i wonder if they use them outside of the game ?"
8331,"yes , that is one of the interesting technologies . it's also funny that espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow line ."
8332,interesting invention . did you know that each nl game only has about 11 minutes of live gameplay ? i wish we could just watch those in fast speed without commerials . i guess with technology i might be able
8333,"yeah , maybe football would interest me more then . i lose interest when ewatchinv football ."
8334,i like htat badns mostly . an engineer makesm or in al ifetime thant he average nfl player
8335,"speaking of careers , baker mayfield once was going to quit football in order to become a full tiem competitive gamer ."
8336,he claimed he could beat anyone at the unifersity of oklahoma oneonone at halo 3 . ro people really make a living as a gamer ?
8337,"i think there are really rich gamers , but you have to be really good ."
8338,odds seem against people j would think to make out at that career . the highest score ever at a football game was georgia defeating cumberland 2220 .
8339,"yes , but odds are also against most in the nfl as well . that is funny about cumbelrand ! doubt any of them made it pro !"
8340,that's true too . i wonder if females will make it to the football pros ? there is no written rule against femlaes being eligible
8341,"i hope oen day it happens but i'm ot sure bedause of the biologicla divferences . you never know , thoughb . i wihs more people were into watching women's sports ."
8342,"yes , cerftain musculature is different , did ou know that footballs in the nfl have tracking chips ?"
8343,"yes , i learned that recently . is the tracking for data purposew ort o ensyre everything is fazir , or something else ?"
8344,"i'm not sure , but probably to analyze with some c9mputer so tey da nimprove upon technique . if you are poor , i guess you don't benefit from sl lthese upgrades in ' talent ' from learning these things"
8345,"true4 .; speaking of inventions in the nfl , did you know that the ci9rcular huddle was made by a deaf q8arterback so that the 0ther team couldn't wee his singlas ?"
8346,"yes , i've heard that one a few times . i wonder if there is some tracking spy device now they use to overcome tha ?"
8347,that technology could very wel lexis t!
8348,"ji , hgow are you this evening ? have you experienced many disconnection s? i have !"
8349,"yees , i have ! i am good , how are you ? brett favre apparently tried out for monday night football and failed ."
8350,"was there a test forh ow far he could throw a football ?h e would do well at that . the speaking part5 , maybe not so goo d"
8351,he is no longer under cnsideration . favre denies it was like that .
8352,the man is a uasbeen . he shoul djust go back to his hometown and take up his old life .
8353,he thouyht it was important toc l;ear it up so he went onto titter . he ssid it went well but that he did not want to go into broacasting right now .
8354,"yes , that sounds completely reasknaqble . probablyw ants to drive a tractor , hunt wild animals with a football . did you know that the nfl hax no rule against women ;layers ?"
8355,h a. i heard that . i hope a woman will be able to meet teh leugibility requirements one day .
8356,"i twould make the gaem more interestign , maybe more dainty . i woul dlike to see a woman kickef or punter . maybe a women cosch or two ."
8357,then again i am doubtful . the nfl seems a biy old fashioned . saints cheerleaders have tol eave a restaurant if player scome in after them and want to eat tjhere .
8358,"the cheerleaders get treated badly . low pay , long bhoyrs , there should be a union . plus maybe men cheerleaders ?"
8359,"hha , right ? i am not too interested in watching foo5ball in any case . maybe because thede ar only 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
8360,"i would watch it if i could make money on it . i wouldn't want to play , even at 11 minutes a game .t oo risky . career too shoet ?"
8361,"righ , i heard taht the average engineer earns more on over a lifetime than the average football player"
8362,"women wouldb e better off going into engineering . they could make more ,a nd nots uffer so many oncussions . the brain is the center of intelligence , even in football players ."
8363,"yeah , i've heard that some footvall players hav4e suffered depression b3cause of brain injuries"
8364,"cte is a serilous pronlem . probably e4ngineers should work on better helmets , but that might not be enough . maybe chips in the helmets to track impact ?"
8365,"yeah , i fthey have tha ttehcnology to track footballs and playerse very move they should be able to do that"
8366,teh highest score ever imn a football game happened in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 .n o technology at the t9me to track that embarrassment . the gtc oach should have put women in th egame .
8367,"wow , that seems like a gmase i would want yto watch . wonder wayht happened ."
8368,"i would have bet on the game , but what was the spread ? well , as they say on the flintstoens , i had a gay old tjme . talk at ya latr ."
8369,"hello , are you a fan of the lf ?"
8370,"hey there , yes i am . did you know women can play in thr nfl ?"
8371,yeah i guess there is no written rule as long as they qualify .
8372,"yeah pretty cook , hope they try for it . the game is only 11 minutes"
8373,exactly the rest of the timer we are glued to the tv stuck with commercials and the players gettign into position
8374,yeah pretty much . did you hear about that rule about new ofleans cheelreaders ?
8375,yes about them now being ablet o eat in tej same restaurant as tje players
8376,yes adn the worst part is that they have to also leave midmeal
8377,"so sexist , hope they g3t rid of it . engineers apparetnly make moe than players"
8378,teah i guess they hav4 lobger careers so that would lalow them to make more mkoney
8379,yeah that makes sense actually . did you know theu are using tracking chips on the players now ?
8380,yeah they are tracking speed adn velocity and al lthat fun stuff
8381,yeah i hope they can use that to reduce concussions on player and make the game safer .
8382,that would be awesome . do you kno wwho ale xsmi9th is ?
8383,yeah he is a great qb and a genius it seems . h efinished college ijn two years
8384,yeah he managed to do that by taking lots of ap tests in high school
8385,"yeah smart kid , plnaned ahea d. did you know alex skmirh finished cllege in two year ?"
8386,yeah the kid was so smart he took ap tests in high schoo. and was done college in a breeze
8387,yup . baker mayfield laso wanted to quit football and become a competitive gamer
8388,well it is a good hting he changed his mind . he still claimns that he can bezt lots of peope in halo 3
8389,"yeah , iw oder if there is any truth in ther ethough"
8390,"lets talk about quarterbacks , the huddle was created by a deaf quaterback originally ."
8391,"ki've heard that , paul d . hubbard , he did it ao the other team could not read his hand sinals . hat's pretty innovative ."
8392,"i agree ,t here is only one left hnaded quarterback in the nfl , kelaln moore"
8393,"oh wow , i didm't realize that . it seems thag tom brady had a rough start in football k hisa jvt eam had a historically bad season in which they didn't win a game nor score a touchdonw , yet they never gave him a chance to play hecause he was the backup quarterback ."
8394,"baker mayfield could have went another path , he really enjoys gaming , such as hlao 3"
8395,it's a good thing he stuck with football . he did pretty great for his rooki eseason with hte browns .
8396,alex smoith has his bachwlor's degree and was able to achieve that in only 2 years
8397,"oh wow , that's cool . he's done better than me . i went to xchool for 6 year sfor an associ8ates . haha ."
8398,"lets talk about tue nfl nexrt , women could play in teh nfl , there is no written rule against it"
8399,"i didn't know that , i'm surprised there hasn't been a woam to play . i think it would be great ."
8400,"therde are so many commercials , the averag egame only has 11 minutes of live gameplay"
8401,that's pretty wild . theyt ake like 3 hours . i guess taht's how they make their money .
8402,therew are tracking chips in player's shoulder pads that the nfl uses to track movement on the field .
8403,"that's neat . dot hey use it to track veloc9ity , rotation , ball speed and location ?"
8404,"yges , engineers can ak emore in a lifetime then nfl players"
8405,"that's crazy ot ghink ,b ut i guess an engineer's career is a lot longer than an ntfl playr ."
8406,"yes , lets talk about football next , bowlers in the 1960's made twice htat of nf players"
8407,oh wow . did you kn0w thart the high score ever in a football vamew aw 2220 ?
8408,"interesting , thec reaqtion of the yellow first downl ine won espn an emmy"
8409,that's a prstigious award . i've heard that university of iowa's visiting locker room is compldetely painted pink . that has to fire up the opposing team .
8410,benjarvs greenellis in hi snfl career has never fumbled .
8411,"hi , how are you ?"
8412,im doing great . are ou an nfl fan ?
8413,"yes , i am . go pattiots ! how abut you ?"
8414,go steelers . lol . did you know that there have been ony two black qbs win the super bowl .
8415,"wazn'a war eof that . i know my man , tom brady has won more than two ! how many ha syour big ben won ?"
8416,he has two . did you know thatb rad johjson qctually threw a ftd pass to himswlf ?
8417,"fool , i don't even know how that' spossble , but ok ."
8418,a linejmen tips the ball into the air . then the qb catches the ball of fthe tip and runs into the end zoen . lol .
8419,"i knew physifs was involved , somehow ! ll sounds like a risky move ."
8420,wlel they dont do it on purpose . its just haw the play happened . did you know tht there is only one left handed qb in the nfl .
8421,"seems like there wouldb e more than 1 , it must be som etype of advantage . i know your team wawn't in the last szuperbowl , but did you watch it ?"
8422,it was on but i didnt realply watch it lol . i catn stand the patriots .
8423,"i knew it ! peoelo ove to hate on my patriots . i grew up in that area and have always followed them , so i can't hlep it , ok ! lo.l that dang game was koverd three hours long , i about ran out of beer ."
8424,it will be ok . did yo u kn9w tbat 1r of the 25 largest stasiums belong t0 college football teas ?
8425,"i love in the south , now . so yeah i know hpw big college football is ! so , i can underetand why the stadiums are big , heck even some of the high school stadiums would impress you ."
8426,that is true . the first palyoff game for the nfl was played on a 80 yard field in chicago stadium in 1932 .
8427,"probably , none of those old timers still alive that played in that game ."
8428,i think it would be possibl ebut probably jot very many .
8429,"that's back when they wore those littlet hin skull caps for helme6ts . hardly no rules at all , bsically anytging goes !"
8430,hey did you know ben roethlisberger has the most wins hby a qb in the brownsh ome staxium since they were reinstated ?
8431,"i didn't know that fact .h ey , it's been func hatting with you htis mornin about all things football . i hope you enjoy hute rest of your day ."
8432,"hi , do you like footvall ?"
8433,i have a passing knowledge of football and the nfl
8434,that isg oid q w eare getting close to the superb owl !
8435,how familiar are ou wiht the nfl ?
8436,"i like the denver broncos a lot . but there were many things i did not know , like that there is not a rule against femape players !"
8437,i was surprised thatt he average nfl game onlyh ad 11 minutes of gameplay
8438,"that suprised me too , did you know what embedded chips are use for in teh nfl ?"
8439,"i beli8eve they embed chips into footballs to track velofity , rotation , abll speed , and kocation"
8440,"that is rigb t, i thin kis great because that is how we get so much info on the performance . i had no realize the teams 9nly rest one week suring 5he season"
8441,"evn when they plqy , there are chips in theirs houlderpads to track their movement and gather data for better plays nad understanding of footb,l"
8442,"that is good ! i learned that there was a game back in 1916 and the score was 222 to 0 by georgia tehc , isn;'t tyhat amazaing"
8443,another amazing fact is that benjarus green ellis never fumbled the football in his entire nfl career . both amazing incidents nad people
8444,"thay 9s tru e. something that i found really funny is htat u o ioal ovker room for the visiting team is painted n pink , i think that is a message"
8445,i wonder if there is a funny or interexsting reason for this ?
8446,the want fto intimidate the visitors ! an interesting fact is that there is only one left handed qb in the nfl
8447,"speaking of qb , quarterbacks are myf avorite position in foobtall since they are the core of the teams offence ."
8448,they are so important they are thel eaders and tjey are the one sthat call for the hudcdle
8449,did you know that signature circular huddle wae invneted by a deaf quarterback to prevent the other team rrom readinjg his hand singals ?
8450,i think that is so neat ! his name was paul hubbard
8451,"did you also know tha ttom brady , who has won the su;erbowl on several occasion , seved as a backup qb and never got to play during highschoo l?"
8452,that is hard to believe ! ! i found it 5eally funny . 2ell it was nice tlaking to you . . have a good one
8453,hello . are you familiar with the nfl ?
8454,"i am a fan , the chicago bears . you ?"
8455,i used to be a fan of 49ers . i lived in the bay area for 25 years .
8456,not any more ?d id you move ?
8457,yes i did . i heard that nfl has no rule against femae playeds .
8458,no rules agaisnt females ? that's interesting ? where di you ove to ?
8459,as long as tehy meet the league's eligibility requirements . it would n9t be easy even for physically strong men .
8460,i cannot hbelieve the controversay clay matthews has brought on with all his roughing penalties .
8461,i did not answer your earlier question . i moved to a dallad suburb . i hesrd that clay was penalize dfor roughing tge passer for a thirdquarte5r hit on redskinw qb alex smith .
8462,yeah . he got two in the first few games and had to pul lback the rest of the season . no worries about not answerin gthe question . i didn't want to9 probe too much if you didn't want tpa nswer . spo are you a dallas fan now ?
8463,no . i have not been here ery long . mathew apparently violate dteh directive that a defender cannot land on a quarterbacj .
8464,"as a bears fan , i was happt o see it ! did youk now the nl uses chips in sholder pads ?"
8465,yes i do . technology is used every where now .
8466,i know . i am a little worried about it . do you know who the only roket scientist in the nfl is ?
8467,no . please tell me about ut . is that laex smith ? he finixhed college in two years .
8468,"good guess but it's the lions cowch , matt patricia ! alex smith ias really smart though ."
8469,"oh , okay . thank you . do you know thes trange rule related to the new orlean saints cheerleaders ?"
8470,i do not . what is it ?
8471,"cheerleaers cannot eat at the same restaurant as the players . if they are at he restaurant and a playrr or players coke om , they have to leave ."
8472,that seems really sexist and incredibly inconvenient for the cheer leaders . what a terrible rule .
8473,"the rule neecds to bec hanged , fors ure . i've got t run . nice chatting with you ."
8474,hello ! do you like to watch football ?
8475,i soemtimes watch football . you ?
8476,"yes same here ! i can't believe that in yhe 1960's , bowlers maqde more money than football players ."
8477,the footblal playersm ight not have made much . it was a golden age for bowlers though . i guess i was born tool ate .
8478,are youg ood at bowling ? i'm terribel so i would have mac eless money playing fotball .
8479,i would have been terrible at both . i would have had a job painting locker rooms .
8480,would you paint visitor locker rooms pink like thw iowa hawkeyes '
8481,"i guess i would try it . if it wlorked on the other tam , then i would sell m7 services to every team ."
8482,i feel a business plan coming soon ! i wish i was the onde who created tne yellowl ine in football games . espn won an emmy for that .
8483,i bet the person who came up with idea got a raise and a promotion . that was a goord idea .
8484,ia gree ! i likew atching the hfl but i can't believe we really only wtch 11 minutes of actualg ameplay !
8485,i would just watch the ighligths from the news . thar would probably be enough . it isa n expensive sport to wastch .
8486,it really is . i doi like the technology taht the nfl has been using though !
8487,do you mean the cyips that the players have ?
8488,yes htose ! they can basically track players every kmoves and i think they do things with the footballs as well .
8489,thqt is great . i bet i thelps coaches wiht strategy and the tv anniuncers with analysis .
8490,"when you watch instant replay , it all makes sense now . did you know there is only one keft handed quarterback in the nflr ihgt now ?"
8491,that surprises me . where are sll the others ? is that so unusual ? there are left handed pitchers .
8492,i wonder if there is a disadvantage ? i can nmae thtree lefthanded quarterbacks ever haha .
8493,there might be prolems fkr the rest of the team to adapt to a lefty . i wonder .
8494,thats a good question ! well thanks for an wawesome talk . hafve a good one !
8495,do you follow american football ? the cleveland browns will get a new coach at the end kf this season .
8496,"wow ! there are only 32 nfl he3ad coaching positions , so they're higuly co0veted . but then , it's the browns !"
8497,lets just hope next season is a betterr season tha nthis past with coach hue jackson .
8498,"and lately baker mayfield has revealed the full extent of his sparkling potentia.l . he was a first round pick , and is the roolkie quarterback . with the right coach , maybe the browjs can win wome big gaems ."
8499,"well , they hqve a good quiarterback , so that is a god start to winning games ."
8500,"on a recent sunday , mayfield led the browns to a 3520 vctory over t6he cincinnati bengals . it's nice to win against another ohio team !"
8501,wit5h mayfiled as the quarterback i am not surprisef the brown won . he is gooda nd the quarterback position is involved so much in otfrnsive play .
8502,indeed . and he's still just a rookie . did you kno2 thatw hen he was a tthe univetsity of oklahoa he considered quitting to pursue fulltime competitive gaming ?
8503,"i wonder if he would have been good at it . there is mo9ney in the nf l, but you rlifetime earnings are less than that othe rjobs , such as engineer ."
8504,"wow . probably less risk of injury as an engineer , too ? it's still a lot of minutesf or just an average of 11 minutes 9f live gameplay , which is th4e average for an nfl game !"
8505,"as a woman i suppose i could technically eb allowed to play in the nvl , but i don't think i have the talent . i don't think ih ave the patience to be a cheerleader becajse of their rules ."
8506,i know ! i hea4rd that new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in th esame restaurant as any nfl player ! thwt would not work for me !
8507,"and , y9ou would have to find something to do the rest of the year , as the season is only 17 weeks ."
8508,"in the 196s0 , top bowlersm ade twice as much as t9op football stars . i wonder how the salaries compare now ? learnong to bowl might be cheaper than engineering school !"
8509,"well players have received degrees , so i suppose they could have a career after football ."
8510,indeed . i lovet o watch footbaqll on tv . especially since espn created the supefimposed yellw line representing teh first down line for americna ootball games . they on an emmy for that ! dp you like to watch football ?
8511,"there are amny types of footbal l, do you mean nfl am3rican style , of what the rest of the world calls football byut americans call soccer ? ."
8512,"good point ! i love to watch gridiron football , or american or canadian football , and i love rugby football , too . it's hard to believe football has been around so long . did you know there are references to it by indignou speople in many different parts of the world , even in prehistoric times ! ?"
8513,"there are so many types , but since i live where footblal is a regional word for the nfl style that is what i see . i am not surprised that it is a really old sport ."
8514,"there really are . iduring the 20th century , several of the various types of football became some of the most popular team sports in the world !"
8515,"in amerjca it is been over a century of playing . teh highest scoring game ev4 rwas long ago in 1916 , with a score of 2220"
8516,"wow ! 222 points in one game ! almost as bad as some browns losses ! mayber the winners heard the other gteams play calls . .d id you know the circula rhuddle teams use today was crea5e dby pal d . hubbard , a deaf qua5tebrakfc ? they used it so the other team couldn ot read his hand signals ."
8517,maybe the new coach for the browns will help th4m to the playoffs and the superbowl this yer .
8518,"i hope so ! the first thing any coach ness is a good quarterback , ad like we talked about , bake rmayfield is a good one ! and since quarterbakcs are often responsible for calling hte play and touching the ball on nearly every offensive play , he should hav3 a big impact . a good coach adn a good quartebrack might finally get the browns to the super bowl ."
8519,clevelans can hope so ! thanks for talking football with me .
8520,do you watch the nfl ?
8521,yes all the time . did you know the women can play too ?
8522,yes there is no rule against that as long as they qualify
8523,yes i hope we get to see a coed game sometimes soon
8524,yea me too . did you know the game technicaolly is ony 11 minutes ?
8525,yes and we are glued to the tv for 2what feels like forever
8526,"yahah i know . did you know engineers make ,more over the ,lifetij ethan nfl players ?"
8527,yes but they also have longer careers so maybe that has an effect on the income
8528,true . did youh ear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
8529,yes it is sexista nd it has to go hobestly . did you know u of iowa paintee the visitor locker rom pink ?
8530,hm i wonder if it is supposed to ahves ome effect on them
8531,i wonder too . in the 60s bowlers mad emore money than football players
8532,wow i guess it was a much populwr sport back in the dwy so that makes sense
8533,yes it is true . did you knowe spn won an emmy ocne ?
8534,"yes that wa sfor the superimposed yellow line , what a feat"
8535,yez . do you know 3hat the highest score in coll3ge fooktbwll is ?
8536,yes that is 2220 when eorgia tech beat cumberland
8537,yes . do you know who benjarvus el;ks i ?
8538,yes the rb that never fumbled the ball . do you liek tom brady ?
8539,ye si do . in high chool hw as a reserve qb ggat was never started
8540,"theh lost a great chance with him there , too bad for tehm"
8541,hello ! do you follow the nfl ?
8542,sure ! what do think of the cowboys acqiisition of amari cooper ?
8543,it gave them someone they desperately needed after losing dez bryant .
8544,"that is for sure . cooper had a good run in his first years in ghe league , but his performance with the raiders has been lackluster as of late . i hope he can step it up with the cowboys !"
8545,yes ! i'm sure with the use of the4 tracking chips that they put in the players shoulder pads to record tyeir every move he ill start to work on his roufte running .
8546,maked sense . it seemsl ike a lot of technology for a game that only has 1q minutes o factual bal play in the enbtire game .
8547,"that's awful short for the amount of money they get paid if you ask me . speaking of earnings , the average lifetime earnings of an average negineer re higher than that of an average nfl otr mlb player ."
8548,"yeah , buy they both eat well . that is not true for thec heerleaders ! bvesides watching tgeir weight , ome clubs , like the saints , prohibit che3arleaders from dining in the sme resaurant as the players . that can put a crimp in your diet !"
8549,that seems like an odd rulw . i wondsr if we'll see a female nfl player any time soon since there's no written rule agais5 allowing them to play ?
8550,"yeah , it may b ethe only way the ladies can get a good meal ! the univ of iowa already has their visitors locker roo, painted pink , so we azre getting dlose !"
8551,i wonder if that waw for breastc acner awareness ? in thr 1960's top bowlers made 2 time sas much as the top football star sof the day . times sure have changed since then .
8552,"i'll say ! in the 1906s , there was no espn emmyawardwinning yellow line superimposed on the tv screen ! revolutionied the gzme for us armchair qbs !"
8553,yes it did ! i can't believ ehte score of the highest scoring gam eefer . georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 !
8554,"a lot has changed since 1918 when that performance made the record books , but it is nice to see a record like t6hat stl,l standiny today !"
8555,that's just a crzy score . lol did you know that the cidcular huddle was created by a deaf qb so he culd relay hand signlas to the otber playeres ?
8556,"nice ! and now the phrase , huddle up ' is known acroxs the entire palnet !l ess onow nis that the only lefthanded qb in hte nfl today is kellan moor e. i miss john elway !"
8557,yes . that whkle era when elway played seemed like it was better than now . the quarterback toucnhes th eball on alm0ost every offensive play ajnd ix the one responsible for always calling the plays in the huddle .
8558,"y4ah , where are the modernday refrigerator perry type runners today ? there are some good oens ,l ike bsnjarvis ellisgreej , th epatriots rnningback that never once fumbled the bal lin his entire career , but it ish ard to find a legrnd on the field these days !"
8559,that's a pretty impressive stat to have ! current browns qb baekr mayfield almost 2uit football so he could pursue a full time vompetitive gaming career . sounds like tfhat would have eben a bit risky .
8560,"yeah , but it speaks toward the mnetality od oue youth . i could not imwgine as a child if i had a chance to go outside and play football that i would have passed on it to stay inside and pretend to play football . i know mayfield is more of a halo 3 guru , but the i think you know what i am saying , right ?"
8561,yes i do know ! lol it ws nice chatting with you !
8562,"hi , do you like cootball ?"
8563,no it seems to go on forever
8564,but if onl6 has 11 minutes of playing time . . .
8565,es and the season only goes on for 1u7 weeks but then they drag it on with al lthose ther competi9tilns
8566,"the good news is that they now hav a new league , the aaf . that starts after the nfl . you have to eb even more excited now"
8567,"woo hoo , do you like football ?"
8568,i can feel the sarcasm . . . . i do . i also understnad why people do noft watch it . there is so much more to do on a shnday than watch footblal .
8569,back in the 1960x bowlers earned more than footballers how timesc hange
8570,engineers now make more than the avg football players . seems like a poor decision to ris permahent brain damage .
8571,one plaher even considered competiftive video games instead i wond3r if theyw ould mak emre ?
8572,"it wouldn't hurt asb ad . plus mayfield was a great halo player , supposedy . . ."
8573,why is there ohnly one letft handed quarter back ?
8574,left handers turow a ball that rotates opposite of right handers and fade in the opposite direction . i9t is difficult to chage and get comfortable with them .
8575,i never kew that
8576,i am full of useless sports kmowledge .
8577,did you know already that iowas painted the locker room pink ?
8578,that's a we9rd choice of color l i wonder if it actually works ?
8579,what is it indended to do ?
8580,make thre visditing team play softer . i do not think thar woul.d work on me .
8581,maybe they shoudl of tried with georgia tehc in o116
8582,h a! it was nice cnatting with you !
8583,how arr you tyoday ?
8584,"hey i'm good , how are 6ou ? are you a nfl fan ?"
8585,i am and am coing wll thank you .
8586,are you an nfl fan ? familiar with nhick foles aw6 all and what an unlikely story h3 was ?
8587,"don't know a lot wbout him , whqts the unlikely story about ."
8588,"well , the eagles were doing awesome with qb carson wentz and were favorites , but then he tore a kmnee ligament in week 14 and aas out for the rest of the season"
8589,yeah tuat is a unkikely story . did you hear the iowa state visiting locker room is pink
8590,"no i didn't . that's pretty weird but proabbly messes with other teams heads . are you familiar with football , specifically then lf ?"
8591,"to the best of my knolwedge , dn';t get to watch theg ames as much anymore and wzas xisappointed with the performances in the super bowl not becessarily the outcome ."
8592,"ah okay , so did you see when nick foles won the supe5b owl last year ?"
8593,jhonestly disd not watch last years . was it a good game ? i hear the live action in the game is only about 11 minutes .
8594,ig was pretty awesome to see a backup winning it . voles was confident though . i did know that . a lo tof commerciasl and play clalin g.
8595,yeaj i hear there going to start putting tracking chips on the players pads .
8596,"yeah , laso inside the footballs . cool technology . i wonder if the quarterbacks care since they touch 6heb all so much ."
8597,"probably not , they got enough to worry about ! did you know that there was a time whebn bowlers made twice as much as top nfl players ?"
8598,"i've heard that before , that'z crazy . but at the saem , did you know the average lifetime earnings of an negineer is higher tha nann fl pkaye r?"
8599,yeah you can't play pro football for 5 0yesrs . do you know what the highest scoredc college gsme was ?
8600,i know those games can out of control sometimes and be very high scoring o rlopsided . tell me .
8601,it was georgia tech and cumberland the score was 2200 . cumberland lost . i would have hated to be on that bus ride home .
8602,"2200 , wow . i wonder if the cumberlnad quarterback did anything at all or did they just constanty turn over the ball ."
8603,"i twas back i n1916 , things were a lot different then . hey i heard espn won an award ."
8604,yes . i know why . they added that famou syellow line that w enow see on every game on tv for teh 1st down marker .
8605,"that's right , i like that line it makes things muh easie r. nice chatting with you ."
8606,"hi . are you ready to talka bout quarterbadks , national foo6tball league , and football ?"
8607,"yes , i love football , and enjoy going to thwe games ! !"
8608,i really love going to those live gamez where yo can get te feel of the game . quarterback sare my favorite . did you know that alex smith tooi so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a junior and graduated with his bachelor?s degree in two yars ?
8609,he must be smart as well as taldnted ! ! maybe he has a photog5aphic mind . . . . i do too like qua5terbacks . do you liek avocafdo ice creaml ike tom brady ?
8610,"yes , i've actually made it in my vitamix and it waqs good . yoh cannot taste the avocado in it . tom bradh is smart like that . he's my favorite qb . i didn't know but recently found out that the qb is considered the leader of the offensive team and calls the plays in the huddle ."
8611,"yes , that's true and a deaf player started htat huddle so the othber team could not see the palys ! ! interesting . . ."
8612,"yes , htat wqs paul hubbard , right ? he was the deaf player that created the xircular huddle . cpol ."
8613,"yes , i lovet om brady too ! i got to see jim this year at walt disney world after the game in the parade ! !"
8614,"wow , how lucky ae you ? did you also know qabout former patriots rn ebnjarvus greenellis and that ue never fumbled the football in his nfl career ? that's a unique attribut e."
8615,that is impressivef or sure ! ! did you know tom brady's wife makes twice as much as he does ! lol
8616,"wow , hat' sa lot of money between ghe two ov them . apparently , the average lifetime earnihgs of an engiener is higyer than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl or mlb plqyer . engineers mustg make a lot of money ."
8617,yes they do ! ! did yu know tom brady has never ate a strawberry ! no6t sure hwy ? thinkinb eh might have allergies ?
8618,"yes , htat would be a good reawon not eat any . did yoj know that new orleans saint'd cheerleaers are forbixden from eating i nthe same restaurant as any nfl playe r?"
8619,"y3s , that's a little outdated don't you think ? maybe they think there would be too much togetherness in the restaurant . tehy should let eah other know beforehand where their going if its such an issue ! lol"
8620,"i didn't think about it that way ,b ut you could be right , maybe it's an old rule3 still on the books . did you that the nfl has no written rule against femal3 players ."
8621,"yes , i wonder how they would play against such big guys ? aybe eh kicker position would be safe . at ,east they have the option , never know ?"
8622,"the problem is how could aw oman meet the eligibilit7 requirements , really ?"
8623,"lol , i agree ! did you know as far as losing games , the new englabnd patriots and the4 buffalo bilsl aree qual ?"
8624,"yes , i did just hear that . the new englnad patriots are dfoing way better sicne they just won the last super bowl though ."
8625,"htat's true , after 15 seasons as starter tom brady has lead te patriots to 8 superbowls , more than any plaer in history ! !"
8626,"yes , what a great quarterback he i . nice chatting with you , have a good one ."
8627,"hello , are you a fan of football ?"
8628,love the football ! what'a your faborite team ?
8629,i am not a hue fan ! i think teams like the rams and bronco are interesting though .
8630,benjarvus greenellis never fumbles the football in his nfl career . i wonder if he ever played against iowa state . their pink visiting team room might have affected him .
8631,"that's interesting , it must be difficult to never fumbel the ball . did you know women are technically allowed to play in the nfl ?"
8632,i think that's great ! i wonder what position the first woman in the nl will play . it's jut a matter of time .
8633,"there is already some misogyny present in the league , such as cheerleaders in new orleans having to leave a resfaurant if a saints player comes in after ."
8634,tbe hypermasculine nature of the sport makes that kind of bigotry inevitable . i think that tehy need to rethink the role of wman in the slpor . i see more women on the screen as sportscasters .
8635,"absolutely . n nfl career itsekf may not even be as worth it as i thought . for 4example , the average lietime eardnings ix much higher for ah engineer than a football player ."
8636,we need engineers more than grown m4n playign with a ball . i wish we could inspire kid sto study ejgineeding .
8637,that is certainly fair5 . there is an interesting element of engineering in football ironically . shoulder pads and footballs habve tracking chips inside of them for example
8638,i guess it helps understand things like injuries . it could also be used for strategy .
8639,"abolutely . howeve rfootball could be more progrexsie , such as iowa's visiting locker room being pink ."
8640,"i think that's meant to psych out the opposition . i wonder if it really worsk ,"
8641,"i doubt it freally does , i woul hope poayers aren't thwt fragile . i can't believe teh highest score ever was 22320 though , thats ewms ridiculously high !"
8642,"didn't expect a tech shcool to play football well , but cumberland might have been tiny . i wonder wgat ghe spread was ."
8643,ahh i woner if betting was evsn a thinv back then . i suppose that iznm't as bad as the jv football team that couldn't even score a touchdown the entire year .
8644,maybe those jv players wou;d have been better off as engineers . or bowlers in the 1960s .
8645,"definitely , it's in5eresting how players think about other carwers . such a sabker mayfield considering coosing competitive gaming over footbal l."
8646,"fewer injuries , perhaps some nteresting sponsorship opportunities ."
8647,"absolutely , but i'm sure most don't regret choosing football . it was nice chatting with you !"
8648,nixe chuat !
8649,"i can't wait for the superbowl this year . but , out of the 32 teams , my team isn't in it . d9 you watch the nfl ?"
8650,i like to watch and am also excited about the super bowl . i don't eeally get a chance to watch though .
8651,you may eed your sunglasses if you watch the univsrsity of iowa and visit their pink loxker room . that sounds really bright !
8652,yeah i waws thinking anout that . i assum it was to discourage the other team .
8653,luckyt he football layers didn't get discouraged in the nfl in the 1960's when bowlers made twice as much as the football stars
8654,yeah that was surprising to hear . it was unbeliecable that they a;.lowe da football game to continue with a score like 2200 . mercy ! !
8655,sounds like someon was taken advantage o f! hey losing team soundw like they needed the fomrer patriot benjarvus greenellis who nver fumbed in his nfl cfareer .
8656,"gthatf or the fact th3re is no official rule that keeps women from playing football , theym ay have had a chance ."
8657,six teams make the playoffs from each conference . i wonder who 2will win teh superbowl after these singleelimination games ?
8658,it will be interestin gto watch . i can appreciate a young person who is also interested in their minds as well as sports . like aloex smith who began workung on his masters before becomijg a first round draft pick in 2005 .
8659,paul d hubbrd was asmazing too in that he was ale to quarterback being deaf . how d8d he know of people wsrse going to sack him ? he even invented the huddle so other teams couldn' tread his hand signals .
8660,yheah that goes to show you just cause circumstances see mintolerable there is always a way to overcome .
8661,"too bad tom brady's high schoo,l jv team at junipero serra high school didn't think of something ingenious like starting brad ! they may have won a game or two ."
8662,lol ! the average gae onluy has 11 minutes of live ygame play
8663,i wonder how long baker mayfield would have to work if he chose fulltiem competitive gaming instead of pro football . i guess more than 11 minutes .
8664,tger eis only one left handedq uarte5 back in the nfl ; kellan moore .
8665,i wonder if thq tmeans he has a lot moren atural talent because with all the technology they use is it geared to assist lefthanders ? donsidering that the quartebrack touches the ball on almost all of the offensive plays that is quite a feat to be different !
8666,yeah whe i pplayed in high school the qb was left handed . it was awkward because the ball spetn the wrng way
8667,"interestingt o yhink about . i guess they don't have a quarterback in soccer , but only inh american and cabadian footbal l."
8668,technology has brougth a lot of things a long way . i mean embddded tracking chips in shoulder pads to track players every move is kind of creepy .
8669,sounds like something from a 007 movie . maybe because of the engineering involved that is why engineers make more average lifetime eanrings than htat of an nfl player and mlb player !
8670,"greetings ! i don't know about you , but i'm not much of a football fan . that's if by ' football ' we mean american football . if it means soccer , then i'm a fan ."
8671,well i like football as an american haha . i don't personally like soccer but thats just me haha . do you have a favorite quarterback ?
8672,not really . but i did recently learn that the quartebrack is considered the leader of the offensive team . i had thought the qb was ij charge of the entire team .
8673,oh i didn't know that eithee . there's a quarterback in th4 nfl who's oeft handed . he's hte only one . his name's kellen moore
8674,just one ? ! taht's interesting . one of the trivia things i kno wbaout quarterbacks is that baker mayfield oncve thoughta bo8t quitting football t becom4 a professional gamer . i guess he's really good at halo 3 .
8675,"that's cool . i used to be really good at halo 3 as well haha . i can't believe those american flawgs at foobtall gmaes can cost up to 50 , 00 . i can think of a lot more cool things to kmake for that much money haha"
8676,geez . the4re's so much money that goes into htis sport k especially salaries . but get a edegree i enginee4ing and you'll make more money over youjr lifetime than if you're an average nfl player .
8677,not a bad idea ! do you like snoop dogg ? i guess he wrote a fight sogn for his son's high sch0ol football team . that's pretty awesome
8678,ha ! somehow i can't see him as a father figur e. but high school and earlied is where many of the great players got hteir stqrt or tried . the jv team than tom brady played fo in high school never uaed him oen season .
8679,isn't that shocking . i wonder if a high school coach is kicking himself . but maybe ton brady wasn't so good back thej . did you hear about the enw high school football stadium in allen texas ?
8680,no . what about it ?
8681,"it cost 60 to make and can house 18 , 000 people . i just think that that money could be begter spent somehow but what do i know"
8682,"60 ? ! are you sure about the amount ? but some facilities are iteresting . fore xample , at the univerity of iowa the visiting team's locker room is painted completely pink ."
8683,oops it was 60 million dollars lol . stadiums are super expwnsive . 14 of the largest 25 atadiums belong to american football teams
8684,"i dixn't know that . i wondefr if any of those teams will on eday have female players . i heard that nfl has no written rule against it , but women would just have to meet eligibility requirements ."
8685,you're right theyg don't have a rule against it . tehy also don't have a rule against tracking their players app0arently hey use chips embedded int he uniforms t5o track the players locations on the field
8686,"hmm . cant' they just see them ? ! ; , it'?s amazing some of ther technology that's used in games . espn , for example ,l won an emmy for creating that supermposed firstdown line we see on tv ."
8687,taht is a geniis invention though ! another genius is matt paticia . i guess he's a rocket scientist to also coaches in the nfl
8688,"i don't know about him . bu ti know some of the players really are smart , contrary to thes tereotype . liek alex smith , wh0 finished his bacyelor's degree in two years and was working on his master's degree whenh e was drafted by the nfl ."
8689,he seems really smart ! did you know thatt he first nfl playoff game was in chicago stadiu mback in 1932 ?
8690,"no , that's a new one on me . i wonder how many teams they had baci then . it's 2 teams now , if i'm not m9staken ."
8691,i do think it's 32 right now . and yes chicago stadium is home to the chicago blackhawks actuallu they share a field
8692,"do you lik efoobtal, ?"
8693,yea the nfl has no written rule against female players ; wojmen would in fact be allowed if they met ther league's eligibility requirements . i wonder why none have ever teisd ?
8694,probably the thought of being a quarterback getting sacked
8695,its hard to say . did u know in the 1960's top bowelrs made twice as much as top football stars
8696,no i did not know the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl playe ror an average mlb player
8697,wow thzts amazing . ana verage nfl game only has 11 minutes f live gameplay . thats even more amazing to me
8698,exactly and during that timet he nfl use stracking chi0s to record players every move
8699,i read that the chips are ij their shoupder pads . it's too technical for me .
8700,also located inside the footballs i ahd no idea
8701,seems a lot of time tracking stuff you know ?
8702,"yes they track velocity , nal lspee d, and location that's so interesting pwopl3e really love football all around the world"
8703,heres a good one . the highest score ever ib a football game occurred in 1916 whe ngeorgia tech defeated cumberland 2220
8704,wow that's a big difference . must bave been a really glod team geogia tech had . like former patriots rb benharvus grenellis has never fumbled a ball in his career
8705,the universit if iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink
8706,so cute ! did you know saints cheerleaders are required to leave a restaurant if a player comes in after
8707,kol thats ridiculous i think
8708,isnt' it . . . they aref orbidden from eating in 5he same restaurant ever
8709,the univeresity of iowa's locker room for visiting footbll teams is completely ;painted pink
8710,es very welcoming whenever there is a female player in the future
8711,lol i hear that lol
8712,gokod night !
8713,"hello ,d o you wathc footbalol ?"
8714,i sometimes watch football . you ?
8715,"sdame , although i do watch the superbowl every year ."
8716,i try to watch the bowl . i didnt get to watch it this year . i heard it was slow . last year was getter .
8717,"yeah it was , the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
8718,that is a shame . the ticketz are so expensive yet there is so little action . and no women in the game either .
8719,"peaking of women , there are actually no rules discrimi8natinh against them to play in the nfl ."
8720,"i figure eventually oje of the teams will put a woman on the team , just for gthe publicity ."
8721,"hopefully , bu5 they migth get injured . flootabll is known for itsc oncussions !"
8722,"yes , boy , those are a problen at every legel . ,maybe there should be high school; girls teams firsy ."
8723,did you know tat engineers make more in a lifetime than nfl players ?
8724,"yeah , that makes snese . longer career , rising salary , fewer concussi9ns"
8725,and professional bwlers made twice as much as nfl players back in the 1960s !
8726,i woknder how much that actulaly was . probably pretty good for bowling . it wa sa golden age . the bowler had the perfect athletes boey . lol
8727,it make ssense az foobtall only startted to grow roughly 25 years ago .
8728,"yes , i thaa grown ttrem4ndously . the first sb was like 53 years ago . not nearly as old as baseball"
8729,"there is also nly one left handed qart5erback in the nfl , kella nmoore ."
8730,he is the only one ? i wam surprised because there are so many left handed pitchers in the mlb .
8731,"yeah , because it is an advantage in the mlb . i guess it is not in the nfp ."
8732,"that could be the case . coaches might notw ant to have to deal with the wrinkles caused by a lesfty . anyway , great chat !"
8733,"yes , have a good njght !"
8734,"thqnk,d ! good night !"
8735,you too !
8736,"i know little about football , but i lnow enough t0 say that toma nd bil; often deliver ."
8737,bill does seem to be qite te coac h. i don't think he has been attached to a losing team has he ?
8738,what i alok know froms port is that one game does nt maek a season . don't get worked up over one loss .
8739,very true . it seems like in football thigns can hcange in an instatn .
8740,"i guess tom rbady is considered one of the all time great , and he still keeps winning ."
8741,he is quite the player . people realkly sem to dislike him though .
8742,"again i dont' really know enough but i suspect it might be jealousy . my undersanding ist hat must have fixed things this yea ri nthe end , didn't tneyw in the super bow l?"
8743,"yeah they did . it wasn't even really a game to be honest .t hey were ahead by so much that it wasn't fun to watch from what i've heqr d,"
8744,i find it amusing that tomb rady struggled to get on his high school 6eam .
8745,that is hilarious . i bet thazt school is kicking themselv3s no w.
8746,"maybe he was just a late bloomer , that might also be the reason he going on so long , isn't he near his forties ?"
8747,i think do . that could mak esnese . it has come a long way from that dirt field in the 30's
8748,"i wonder if the patriots can win again enxt year . there will probably e the same stories before hand , or if they lose a game or two , that tom and bill are done ."
8749,i think htey are probably going to struggl . if they had lost one or the other it wouldn't be ad butb oth being gone is going to be rough .
8750,"i wonder hw the boston area will honor them once theyt are done , some statues or a stadium name possibly ? there are probably lots of quarterback statues around tg ecountry ."
8751,i could see that . maybe they will rename some local stadium fo rthem or something . the certainly have a coplicqted history .
8752,some controversy i believe . spygate and deflategate .
8753,i know about deflategats but i wonder what spygate was . probably them stealing plays od something .
8754,"probably , goes on in most procession sports . someone seen spying on fo the team training , or something similar ."
8755,ah tyhat would make sense . didn't really seem to wokr though with how behind they were before puling out some wins .
8756,good talking to you . bood bye
8757,hi therde do you follow the nfl ?
8758,not too much . i think it's disgusting that the highest paid employees in hte department of defense are football coafches .
8759,wow . they make more than the generals ? o
8760,"they do . maybe snoop dogg can write them a fight song , like he did for his sons' high schoo lteam ."
8761,tnat's awesome ! what's not awesome is that the new orleans eaitns cheerleades aren't allowed to eat at the same restauran6 as any nfl player .
8762,"that's insane , and so sexist . why does a higschool need a 6p0 million football stadium ?"
8763,ahh . . . iv'e heard qbout that stadium . havw you ever been to texas ? high school football is probably more popular than the nfl .
8764,"i have , and didn't care for it . ib et they have a few of those huge flagz , that are over 50k ."
8765,yes i bet they do . the university of iowa's visitord locker room is painted pink . wonder why ?
8766,"imtimidat9on , is my guess . it's probably very relaxing . 9s there really only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?"
8767,yes but i can't remember his name . do yoj know it ?
8768,i think it is kellan moore
8769,that's his name . in the 1960's top bowelrs made twice as much as top football stores of the day .
8770,that is crazy . i guess there is a rocekt scientist who is a football coach . his plays mus ddrive the players crazy .
8771,that's interesting . bet he has some unique plays . did you know that espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down libne on tv ?
8772,that is insane . wy do they put trackinv chipas in the sbhoulder pads of tje players ?
8773,i am not aware of tracking chips ? former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled ths ball in his nfl career . nice job !
8774,they are also in the balls . i wondxer why ?
8775,i have no idea . they must be there for a reason . lol the highest score ever for a football game was2 220 ! thanks fo4 the chat !
8776,i thin kthzat was the georgia tech game l ahve a wonderful day .
8777,thanks you too .
8778,football fan ?
8779,"i like to watch it , but i am not a fan . did yu knowt hat espn wo an emmy for the creation of the euperimposed ?"
8780,"yeah , that's pretty cool . iw onder how that would have affected the highest scoring footabll game of all time . 2220 ."
8781,"i hear dabout ir . think that was in 1976 , but i am not sure wht happenex ."
8782,1916 i think . georgia tech won .
8783,now i remember . in 1960 itw as wh3n top bowlers made twice as top football xtars
8784,ah the halcyom days when bow;ing was lucrative !
8785,i know . do go know something about tyhe footba;l codes ?
8786,i know they're thimking of changing how they apply the ' roughing he passer ' pnealty .
8787,ok . thers are certain ingteresting thing baout football like the fact that a university llcker room is painted pink . don't know why .
8788,i think to intimidate them . pink being ' girly ' . that's sdumb . who cares ? the nhfl could have female players . there's no rule against it .
8789,could be .
8790,the nfl has tracking chips in the shoulder pads 0f players to track their movements on the field . kind of inbtereeting .
8791,thqt's pretty interesting . i guess they want to trac kvelocity and rotation nad some other things .
8792,"yeah , interesting that they would get that deep into the weeds on it . i onder if they do taht i nthe otherf ootball games around thre world , soccer , aussie rules etc . ?"
8793,h9w can they forbidden from eating in the same restaurant ?
8794,cheerleaders ?
8795,ne worleans saints cheerleaderz
8796,i don't know . that seems dumb . trying to disuade frqternization or just really sexiast ?
8797,i dont' know why but it is too muc h. they are required to leave thy erestaurant if an nfl playe comes in after
8798,"well , nice chatting . cya !"
8799,"hello , did you know that the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted all pink ?"
8800,no why would they paint it pink ?
8801,i guess so the opposing team wouldf eel imasucated ? i don't know ! !
8802,"i don't know much about football . it must be popular , there is a lot or people interested in betting on games ."
8803,"ae there ? 8i think it's illegal to bet n nfl game , but i'mn ot sure about college ."
8804,"after q new judgement , sports gambling is now allowed in any state . if you have too much money ."
8805,"i didn' realize that . . . i don't have too much money so i guess i wln'tb e gambling , lol . i didn't realize women could play in the nfl if they wwnted to !"
8806,"there shouldn ot be a 5rule preventing them to play , but i would not follow it more if tehy played ."
8807,"well , there is no ruel but women do have to meet the league's eligibility requirements . maybe that's awhy we don't see any women ? but considerin gthe an egnineer earns more than thew average nfl player , i would recommend higher education !"
8808,"oh i did know that , it seems that football is generating so much money that the plyers would be paid more than engineers .t he highest paid employees in the department ofd efense are football coaches ."
8809,"wait a second , repartment of defens e? as in the militaty ?s o the dod football coaches make more than say a sergeant major ? that's crazy ! ! bhut i guess the average coahc makeds millions a year . . . i dunno"
8810,"football is quite popualr , games generate a lot of money , in texas there is a high school footabll stadium that can hold 18 000 people ."
8811,wow ! ! football is big in texa s. . . and everythihng is big in texas . . . but wow ! ! did you know th ecircular hudd.e was creaed by a deaf quarterback ? he didn't want the other team reading his and signals !
8812,"that is interesting , quarterbacks can be inventive , brad johnson is the only who threw a touchdown pass to himself ."
8813,"how did he pull that off ? tomb rady was the backup quarterback in his hs , his team had such a ba dssason that they didn't win a single game or even score a touchdown ! yet they never put tom bracy in ! !"
8814,"i don't know , maybe it has tlo do with who is the child of whom ."
8815,"good point , that was probably it . but stil l. . . thazt coach must have rally disliked tyom braey or hisf amily to do 5that !"
8816,"there is a lot o money nad prestige in football , 14 of th e25 largest xtdiums in the world are college football stadiums , so politics are never far ."
8817,"that's very true . going back to women and football , the new orleans saint's chearleadersc annot eat int he same restaurant as any nfl player . so if they are eating and a player walks in the cheerleader has tk leave !"
8818,"that s not fair , it puts down the cheerleader like a second class citizen ."
8819,"it does , hopefully the rule will change . i'm sure peo;ple don't follow it though . . . i hope . great chat !"
8820,do you watch much fo9tball ?
8821,"no , i don'yt watch footvball regularly , there is not enough action to keep my attention , there is only 11 minutes of gameplay in a match . and you , do you lie football ?"
8822,iw ill watch it ivf it is on but i on't go out of my way to watch it . i think they focuz t0o much on the qb boh on and off the fie.d .
8823,"yeah , i have heard all the drama abou tthe contract of blake bortles and id on' teven like the jaguars ."
8824,what happened with blake bortles ?
8825,"thd jaguars could have hired kirk cousins , since he is a free agent , but they choose to stay with bortles and give him a 54 million contract ."
8826,wow tha tseems like a nobscene amount of money . is that just for one4 season ! ?
8827,no until 2021 but it replaces th econtract that he alreadgy has . it will be around 19 million per year .
8828,i can't see howa mnyone is that good of a qb t warrant that knd of moneh . imagine if t4hy took taht noney and spread ir around instead of concentraying on one player ? the game could be a lot more interesting .
8829,"that is also what th ejaguars are diib gthey aref ull of young talents , they hope that bortles ill stay good as the the young ones will get btter ."
8830,i guess tqht is a decent stratedgy . i'm for it if it means the patriots get knockrd down a peg or two . i don't even watc hfootball that much and find them annoying .
8831,and to think that tom brady was benched for a season in high scxhool . and it was al osign season for thm too .
8832,he is a quality player but i think they have become the yankees of footall . we have reached a point where sonserships and money have overridden what the game was intended to be .
8833,and waht would improve the game ?
8834,ki think if we were to focus more on what happens during the plays . use some of that info and footage from the chips in th uniforms adn ball ? imagine being able to see thw ball go down the filedf rom that perspective . also put caps on sponserships . of course treat the cheerleaders better is alwaysa top of the list .
8835,"i tink hceerleaders are a relic of the past , and some teams afe treating them like a relic of the last , they should be removed from the gamea nd have their own competitive league ."
8836,those compet5atve teamsa are anazing to watch . i would choose to watch that over a football game any day . plis they aren't just there to be eye candy for sokme slobbering men .
8837,"cheerleading is one thes ports where tbhere is the most injuries , therefore it is a legitimate sport . it is funny that it is considered a sideshow in football , another sport will lts of injuries ."
8838,there are wo many injuries in football . i' mglad they ar4 doinv studies now on what the head injuries are doing to the players . it is so dangerous .
8839,"yeah , and they have chips in the p0layers' quipment to monitor concussions . i hope it will help with the situation ."
8840,hopefully there ar ea lot of instances of postc oncussion rage that could be avoided if we canb ette protectt he palyers .
8841,hi how are you ;
8842,just fine . are you a fan of football ?
8843,"i am ,w hay about you ?"
8844,"yeab , there's a lot of interesting facts about the game . did you know there's only one left handed quarterback in he nfcl ?"
8845,"ye s ,kellan moore if i am not mstaking ?"
8846,"yesh , that's right . i bet it must be hard yto defenx against his passes , even with those tracking chips tbey have to wear ."
8847,"they also put trackers im the footba,ls !"
8848,"yeah , that's amazing what they can do . but hey they gotta have some way to enforce some of those wacky rules of theiras ."
8849,agreed and its funny how the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live play .
8850,yeah several hours on television and 11 minutes of play . pretty funny .
8851,that is ridiculous . i was unaware that the average lifetime earnings of an dngineer is more thsn an average nfl or mlb player .
8852,well the keywordt here is lifetime nfl and mlb players can make absurd maounts per year but they usually don't play for decades .
8853,exactly ! if nfl careers were mkre than a couple years that statistic would not be rue i am sure .
8854,yeah . there's also weird htings about football like how saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player . htat's bizarre .
8855,it is also weird and cunny that oiowas opposing t5eams. ocker room is painted all pink .
8856,yeayh i guess that's to try to demoralize the opposing team . not that mny people like pink .
8857,i am ure it probably works . other teams probabl6y hate it .
8858,they do plenty of stuff just to throw off the othjer team . like how the huddle was invented to hide a deaf quarterback's sign language from the other team .
8859,that is interesting . did you know th highrst score of a football game was 222 to 0 ?
8860,yikes . . . . i would not wanna be on the zero team . a sad sad day for georgia tech .
8861,serioulsy ! it was nice chatting with you !
8862,"yeah , thanks for th efun ."
8863,hey di dyou know te nfl uses chips to track the speed of footballs and the players ?
8864,i wonder if they use the data to make better plays and better ynderstand football
8865,"ya that's a goo dquestion , i'm just glad they don't put those o civilians that would be really scary for the government to track you like thagt"
8866,i'm surprised that teh nfl has only 11 min of actual gameply
8867,"ha im surprised but not surprised , i don't like sports so i'm usually bored during games , and ya that kind of explains it haha"
8868,"whiel thue nfl had no writtenr 7ules agains tfemale players , it is a shame tnat some teams have biased rules such as the new orleans saints forbidding the8r chererleader sfrom eating in th4e same restaurznt as any nfl player even if htey came first"
8869,"a that seems relaly weird , also weird is that bowlers used to make more than nfl players bazck int he 60's"
8870,do you like an7y positions in partidcular ?
8871,"can'ts ay thzt i do , i do like qarterbacks though , i was happy tom bradyw on , wha6 about you"
8872,i agree since the qb is the csnter of any offenxive
8873,"i do like the patriots a lot , also that one player who has never fu8mbled the ball , i'd give him the ball every time !"
8874,i like kellqn moore since his is te only lefth anded qb in the nfl
8875,"oh defintely ! iusn't i tcrazy that the average engineer makes more thna the average nfl player over their lifetime , seems silly !"
8876,welpl they probably have to wokr longer overall .m any nfl players retire early due to injury
8877,"ya i think thas what happens , hopefully theyre careful with their money , isnt it wild that espn got an emmy form aking the ylelow line on tv for flootball"
8878,i thinkt haf i sbecause in those 11 minutes of real gameplay so much goe ojn so any help to help digest the situaion for the public regardint a popular sport is a plus and significant contribution
8879,"haha ya it musty be , it's crazy the hgehst scoring football game was 2220 , i'd definitely have given up before then !"
8880,either the winning team had talent like green ellis or tom brady or the losing team were just that bad . perhaps it was both
8881,"haha ic ould see that , apparently it did happen in 1196 so it wzas a long time ago"
8882,i wonder if any other game came anywhere close
8883,ya i haven't seen such a high scoring game anytime recently thats for sure
8884,hello
8885,hey . are you into nfl foobtall ? i like the manning brohters . i'm sad to see eli isn't quite working out for the giant .
8886,"yes i love football . i zam an eagles fan . i think eli manning is a great footbal player ,"
8887,agre . he work shard and has many touchdo9wn passes without interceptions l sad that sometimes that isn't enough .
8888,yes i agree . plus the football player work too hard . six days a week for 06 minutes of football .
8889,yep . eli had a bad season in 2017 and was even benched for a game by coach ben mcadoo . must have been humiliting .
8890,that is humiliating . did you know that baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a fulltime job in ompetitive gaming ?
8891,"i can't see that paying . . . the saints dsure have a good kicker in wil lutz . in one game he made 4 consecutive field goals of 42 , 34 , 37 , an d26 yards ."
8892,yes i agree . eli manning is a 73 year old quarter back so i beliebe ther eisn' tmuch o fa future .
8893,unl4ess he's like brady . maybe he shoud start throwing to himself lime brad johnson did for a touchdown in a superbow l.
8894,i didn't see that in the superbowl . did you know former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
8895,ysep . pretth tight . i qctually like college more than pro . i was surprised to learn that 14 of fhe world's 25 lartgest stadiums are college .
8896,he nfl has no written fule against female plyers . i wobder if college football does ?
8897,"i think thzt's a schoolbyschool thing not the ncaa . college isn't as hightech . then fl puts fracking ch8ips on players to track their moves , velocity , rotation and location ."
8898,"yes , i agree . did yu know the average nfl game only has 1q1 miutd of live gameplay ?"
8899,i can believe it . i played in hs and there was a lot of standing around .
8900,"yes it is alot of standing around , but then goes to the opposite extreme of getting tackled ."
8901,yep . i was surprised to know that kellan moore is the only lefthanded qb ih the nfl . i would think there would be more .
8902,wow . i didn't know that . did you know the university of iowas locke5 rolm for visiting football teams is completely pained pink ?
8903,that's funny . a funny a the nfl actually havng a rocket scientist coach in matt patricia . it doesn't seem lke a good fit for a coach .
8904,i agree . you think she would work for nasa .
8905,agreed . ji wonderw hat hteir wi jloss record is .
8906,hello do you like football ?
8907,"id o , but not as much as snoop dogg ! he wrote a fivht song for his son's football team ."
8908,thats pretty cool ! did you know theres no written law thatw omen cant p;ay in the nlf ?
8909,that's interesting . i did not know that . football foes hav ea lot of rules for different types of fooball and hqve different football codes .
8910,"right . also , the nfl uses tracking chips tot rack the players and the football ! isn tthat interesting ? !"
8911,so much data ! matt patricia must be good at interpretung data . he is the only coach in the nfl who is also w rokcet scientist .
8912,"thats really cool , i guess f9otball and physics have a lp tinc ommon . fdoobtall is such a long game to watch , its like 3 hours long vut only really 11 min in game play ;"
8913,"that is a long time . baseball is also a long sport . nfl quarterback russell wilson is stil lunder contract for baeball , deespite not playing since 2011 ."
8914,thats interesting . i heard the university of iowa pqinted the opposonf teamz locker room pink lok
8915,that's funny . college foobtal lis big time . 14 of thew orld's 25 largest stadiums bleong to college football teams .
8916,"yeah it sdesm like a lot of peolpld put money into college football , thats crazy !"
8917,"speaking of money k, did you know there is a high school football stadium in allen , texas that cost 60 million to build !"
8918,"omg , tats insane lol another fact that i scrazy is there is a running back who had never fumbled a ball in his caeer !"
8919,that's hard to do !d o youk now what else is hard to do in footbaoll ? throw a touchdown pass to yourself . brad johnsn is the only quarterback in nfl histlry to throw a touhcdow npass to himself !
8920,"wow , he must be a fast runner ! i wonder if theres a video of it lol"
8921,"i'd loe to see that clip . speakingy f football clips , jordan reed went viral for a clip of him doing yoga on the sideline ."
8922,iw onder wjy that is a big thing ? people have different ways of preparing fkr a game .
8923,that's for sutre . whatever it takes to get ready . foitball season is grueling . the 17 week reular seasokn runs from early se3ptember to lwte decembe r3ith only one bye 3week .
8924,i recently read that the circular huddle used today was created by w deaf quarterback !
8925,"thaqt's so cool ! the quarterbac kis ther most important player , responsible for calling the play in the huddle ."
8926,"yeah , well its been good chatting , have a good one ."
8927,deo yo8 like sports ?
8928,no not really
8929,pertsonally i like football
8930,i bet . i was going to ask you if you liked sports yo7urself . who is your favorite team ?
8931,i like the patriots . they are the lanisters of football
8932,"cool ,"
8933,how familiar are you wih fooball ?
8934,not at all .
8935,do you know about the nfl league and teh positiosn in football ?
8936,i dl not and i do not care to . do you ?
8937,personally i like the quarterbacks since tey are the cor3e of any offensiv4
8938,i knowt hat the nfl was formed in 1920 .
8939,did you know wna verage game only has a dozen or so minutes of actjal gameplay ?
8940,eleven average min .
8941,"in ny case , that is much shorter than it feel considering it takes hours"
8942,"exactly , so why does it take so long ?"
8943,"a lot of prep , getting organized , planning , etc i guess"
8944,all thwt . thats why i dfont really care . its pointlesds to me .
8945,"i can se4e your point , but i think of all the effort and prep htat goes into makin gor rbeaking the game in thosde few minutes exciting . anyway thanks for chatting ."
8946,i guess . not form e . have a good day .
8947,tue same to you .
8948,do watch washington football ?
8949,no
8950,apparently they rank fourth in the nlf in total ruahing yards .
8951,not too shabby
8952,"it seems good , i don't pay a lot ofa ttention to the statx htough . do you ?"
8953,not very much eithet
8954,the nfl has no written rule agaonst female players .
8955,so 3oman technically can play in the nfl if they were good enough
8956,yeah . it appears so . but engineers on average make more than players .
8957,engineer sprobably have longer career lengths
8958,"yeah , that is what i' massumjng ."
8959,caroloina is doing well laao with 33 such plays .
8960,"itneresting , apparently they put chips in th eplayers sholulder pads ."
8961,the chips go well with ranch .
8962,9nter3sting concept . i think tbey are trying to track playd .
8963,this i svery fascinating
8964,"yeah , i'm sur ehtey are runing the numbers on something ."
8965,also funny that the cheerleaders cant din eat the same place the players do .
8966,"yeah , that is a rfuel htat a lot of teams have i think , not just the saints ."
8967,very interesting informatjon
8968,apparently iowa's okcer room is painted pink for visiting tesms . hilarious .
8969,and top bowlers in the 60s bowlers made more money
8970,"yeah , i know . i'm not a bad bowler either ."
8971,are you a bills fna ? my son ks a huge one !
8972,can't say that i am actually haha . 9 don't really watch sports . how often do yu watch te nfl ?
8973,"quite a bit . i ave 2 boys ! theb ills always have a nissue at quarterback , that i swhy their season iksn't the greatest . i am surprised taht they benched peteramn and started allen . . . but tehy don't always do what i think they should ."
8974,haha yeah i can see that . did you know the nfl uses trsacking chis . tehy put it in the shoulder pads . that would scare me if they could players off the field haha
8975,yes ! and in the footballs ! that is crazy . they ar5e trying to register everything that happens . i guess that isw hat happens whne you are paying somebody big money !
8976,haha yep i agree . did you know that there isz a coach in the nfl thats' actually a rocklet scientist ? hisx name is matt patricia
8977,no way ! i had no id3a . the one thing that i jhave heard is that it is better to be an engineer than a fl or mlb player . much more earnings !
8978,yep you'r3e right ! did you hear abou tthe first nfl playoff game ? it happened bwck in 1932 on an 80yard dirt filled back in chicago somewhere haha
8979,i didn't but i did hear about how the new lrleans saints ch4erleadrrs are forbiden to eating in the same restaurant as any nfl plaer andc they have to leab eif onec omes in . that is too much !
8980,"i know isn't that weird ! you would think in this day and age that that wouldn't be necessaqry . if i were them i would be really upset , are there any quarterbacks that you like ?"
8981,yes . i do liek tom brady . . .l even though there are the haters out ther e. with his recors ! who couldn' tbe a fan .
8982,yep i agree ! i think he?s the best too ! what do you think about kellen moore ? he is the only lefthanded quarterbacj in the entire nfl apparenbtly
8983,i heard about that . did you know tha ttom brasy's high school football team never played him . evne htough they had the worse season where they never won a game or even scored a touchdown .
8984,"no i didn't know that . that seems very olly . although i wonder ifh e got better or if his coach was just stupid haha . did you hea about the guy who threw a touchdown pass in the super bowl , to himself ?"
8985,no ! ? i din't . that would have been something to see . i heard taht baker mayfield the quarterback for oklahomac onsidered quitting to be a competitive gamer . video gaes . do you think there is anym oney in that ?
8986,no i don't think so . at least not a lot anyway . k tgink you made the right choice ! what'sz weird to me is that only two africanamerican quarterbacks have woln the zuperbowl . i wondr why thast is
8987,not sure . but the huddle was created by6 a man who was dreaf and did not want the other team to read hias signals .
8988,"that is really interesting . naother interesting fact is that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high schoo.f ootball tam ,. what a nice dad"
8989,love that ! great talking to you ! have a good night .
8990,"you too ! and make sure to check out the football stadium in al;en , texas , it cost over 60 billion dollars to build !"
8991,absolutely .
8992,hello do you follow the nfgl ?
8993,"i do foll0w the nfl yeah , i lik it , 32 teams , 16 on each divicision , do yo have a faborite team ?"
8994,i do . i like the steelers . i watch all 16 gaems they play eah year .
8995,"i dont follow all the games , mostly the playoffs or in th3 superbowl , did you watch the superbowl this year ?"
8996,i did ! it's usually hekd on the first sunday in fe b. every year . i wae rooting for tbe patriots .
8997,"i was rooting for the patriots a swell , good thing we won , although it was a boring superbowl , it needed more aftion"
8998,i dird . i wonder if we'll ever see any female playefsa ny time soon since there's no rule that doesn't allow them to play .
8999,"i dont htink i will ee that happen , seems like they would be at a dissadvantage"
9000,i was thinking maybe as a kicker ? dxid you know they put tracking chips in the shoulder pads and balls mow to record data ?
9001,"yeah , that could be a good position yeah , and i wonder waht kind of stats are taken out of them , seems really advancd"
9002,almost too advanced if you ask me . maybe the chipsd in theb alls asre attracte dto the chips in the shoulder pads of the wide receivers so the ball will g to them ? lol
9003,"thts a funny gheory , could bd i wouldn discard it"
9004,lol did you know that the averafge career earnigns of an engineer are more than that of an average nfl or mob palyer ?
9005,"i didnt know that , wow , that is so crazy pro players earn so much money thats hard to imagine"
9006,i know . i don't know how they blow through tehir m0ney like they do . i think they get paid too muhc for only 11 minutes of actual live gamepaly per game .
9007,"only 11 minutes , but still its a game with lots of risks , players end with brain damage and thats a sad tfhing"
9008,yrs . i agree . did you know taht thec ircular huddle that we know was invented by a qb whow as deaf so he could rleay the plays to this teammates through his hands ?
9009,"wow he sure left z legacy behind , that was a cleve move , i wonder if they won a superbowl"
9010,i'm not ure . there is only 1 left hander qb in the nfl kellan moore . are you familia rwith him ?
9011,"only one , i think h eretired al5ready"
9012,i thihk so . i'm not familiar with bim . it was nice chatting wit yo7 !
9013,case keenum lined up a deap with the bvroncos and will become their new starter
9014,"really , good for him . he was regarded as the consolation 0rize in fre3 agnecy for teams that needed quarterbacks ."
9015,"this ia keenum's 4th team . he did really we, lin 2017 with the vkikings"
9016,"s8nce we are talkig about football , did youk now thqat a female could play in the nfl . there is no written rule aginst it ."
9017,i've heared that . did you know an average nfl game is only 11 minutes f live gamelay ?
9018,that is cray . i found it unbelievable that the average lifetime earnings on an nfl or mlb player is less 6ahn that of an engiheer .
9019,yes . a.ex smith was very ontellignet and erntered university as a junior and worked on a masters degree ebfore becoming the first 2005 nfl draft pick
9020,"man , athletic an dsmart . that's not fair . did you know that the new orleans saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restauran6 as the players . even worse , if they are already there and players come in , they have to leave . sounds likw a lawsuit waiting to happen ."
9021,"i wonder how htat can be legal ? interestingly , th university of iowa's locker room for visiting football team sis completely painted pink ."
9022,that is hilarious . i find it weird that there is only one left handed quarternack in the nfl . it is kellna moore .
9023,i dind't know but 1960';s top bowlers mace 2x's the amount of top football stars
9024,not so anymore . do you know the reason they use th ecircular huddle today . it was started by a deaf quarterabck named paul d . hubbard . he needed a way to block teh other team from see9ng his signals .
9025,interesting . the junipero serra high school probbaly regrets now tha tthey lost evedry game and never used their player tom brady who is a 4 time superbowl champ
9026,6hatc oach must suck . i learned that georgia tech beat cumberland 2200 for the highest score eve .
9027,thar's insane . sounds like they should have shown more mercy . espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed ylelow line for the first donw in foktball games in america
9028,i did not know htat . i id knowt hat there are chips in the shoulder pads of nfl players to track players every move on the field .
9029,"yes , and also former patriot rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled in his nfl career"
9030,"man , he must have great hand s. goung backt o the chips , htere is one in the foobtall itself . this is to track speed , rotation , adn location ."
9031,that seems too robotjc . cahnging tue gaem a bunch .
9032,"i know , but they get data on everything . i heard the uarterback of the university of oklahoma , baker mayfield considred becoming a compeyitive gamer and quittung football ."
9033,he claims to be able to beat amyone at uniersity of oklahoma oneonone inhn alo 3
9034,"do you like football , the nfl ?"
9035,"yes , but i do have to admit that i watch more ncaa ."
9036,"it can e more exiting than teh pro league , im tired of teh patriots winning all the time"
9037,much agreed there . did you know tom brady did not even get a chance to playw hen hbe was onj v
9038,"i didnt know that , why didnt he get a chance , his the best qb ive seen"
9039,even at age 40 he is really outplaying guys half hkis age . but it helps tha the haa solid players like greneellks on his team
9040,"yeah he is sure a leyend , 40 years old and still has a great dertemintion , i have to give him that , and green ellis was a great rb alao , never fumbled the ball"
9041,they are deginitely making more than stars in the 60's did . then there were paid the same as top bowlers .
9042,"yeah i dont see bowlers amking a lot of money these days , they used t0 earn more that pro football players"
9043,"espn won an dmmy for the yellow pine , i didnt even know there was a category for such a thing ."
9044,"i did h4ar about that , it was suprisingf to me as well but i t6hink the creation of the yellow line changed the game forever"
9045,"especially for the home viewers . made things a lot easier , and thg egwme easier to understand ."
9046,"i agree easier to understand i think its greath ow tech is taking over the game , allow sthe usrr to enjoy it more like thoset rackign chip"
9047,that can also help keep the plyerws safer too .
9048,"i heard some of the rules are changing so maybe with the ehlp of the chips that can happen , sad to see many players ending with brain damage"
9049,"very trues , at least these could measure possible concussions and they could immediately evaluate 5hem nad take them out to rest it they have one ."
9050,"there i sa chip also on the football all kinds of cool stats are taken out of them , like vleocity , rotatin speed , location of the ball"
9051,i wonder if they can use those for revjiews ? it would certainly speed up the game .
9052,"i think they do , they take the stats such as unning time and all and ghat mght help , do you know the new orleans saints ? they have this craazy rule against cheerleaders"
9053,yeah i head . i cant believe they have to leave just because a palyer walks in .
9054,"ysah that iw really unfair and sexist , that rule should be banned"
9055,"much agreed ! its been great chatting , but i must go . have a great day !"
9056,"engineers earn more than football playes overall , and yeah its been nice to chat as well"
9057,hey there do you ever watch the nfl .
9058,"yes , do you ?"
9059,"yes i do , woul dyou wstch it if it had female players ?"
9060,"yes , i woudl that would be interesting ."
9061,"ya apparejntly there is no rule against it , adn so they would acytually be allowed to pllay !"
9062,"agree , did you know thef irst playoff game was played in 1932 in chicago stadjum ."
9063,"no i didn't , i also didn't know therd were 32 different nfl teams"
9064,"yes , how about texas being a big football state ."
9065,"oh it defibnitely is , what is crazy to me is thata n average nfl game only ha seleen minutes of li8ve playing , the rest is kust nonsense haba"
9066,"lol ,t hey have a high school footbqll stadium that cost 60 million to build !"
9067,"wow that is a lot , did you har how hte huddle was invented btw ?"
9068,"npo , how ?"
9069,"up created by a deaf quarterback , he used it to hide his jhand signs from the other team"
9070,"interestint , i also find irt inteesting there is tracking cgips embedded in players shoudler pads that record their every move ."
9071,"ya that is kind of scary , also scary is htat the university of iowa painted the oppsing locker rooms pink , id be mad hahja"
9072,"yes , its hard for me to believe the stadium flahs weihg 1 , 100 pojnds .w ow !"
9073,"that is a ton ! do youl ike the patriots btw ? they have a running back that has never fumbled the ball , ever !"
9074,"i love the patriots ! , and those flags cost 50 , 000 to make !"
9075,"that's insane ! i guess bowlers usdd to make twice what footbal; player smade in the 60's , so they couldn't afford that back then"
9076,"yes , its great t0 know tha tmaerica"
9077,do you ever watch football on tv ? rspn won a nemmy for creating that yellow line they use durin games
9078,"are yoy an nfl fan ? if so , do you remembed reggie hush ? i just learned that the rams wer eorderd to pay him 12 . 5 million for his injury in 2015 ."
9079,"yes , i do enjoy nfl and remember reggie bush , but i don't remember what happneed ? was it thef ault of the rams that l4d to his injury ? 12 . 5 million is a very expensive injury !"
9080,yeah he was pushed out of bounds onto some conrete that ringed the field . that's why the rams were sued 7 . 5m in punitive damages .
9081,"wow ! i don't dremmber that injury , did that injury ned bush's career or does he still play for the rams ?"
9082,not sure . i know it was season ending . the rams maintained that getting puxhed out of bounds is jus part of the game and it'd how he got so far onto the concrete . they lost that argument .
9083,"bush is one of them ost talented running backs in my opiion and the rams should have made it a dafe environment fo rhim to play , however , i think the players should already know the risks involved for playing such a physical sport , do you play footblal ?"
9084,"yeah , it sounded liek kind of a freak thing . . . did you know the nfl has no writte nrule against female players ?"
9085,no i didn'tk now that but i would imagine the females would have to be in great shape to withstand the physical impact of very heavy and muscular linbeackers .
9086,"yep . to answer your question , i played football in hs . many moons avo . . . i'm also an engineer bur i find t hard to believe that my average lifetime earnings are more that that o fan nfl playe5 ."
9087,"haha , i agree , i also find that hard to believe although it does seem like engineers make a lot but i always hear baout football players making millions and millions of doll,ars , i don't think engineers paychecks are quite that lucraive . unless they use those tracking chip data to negotiate better conttacts and salaries ?"
9088,no such luck .m y alma mster ran up the score of 2220 on cumberland in 1916 . can't say i'm proud of humiliating another team like taht .
9089,"that is embarrassing for both parties , at waht point do you just call it quits ? maybe they should'be use the tacti8c that university of iowa dploys in the visi8ting football teams locker room and painted in completely pibk to ibtimidate them or something . would htat work ?"
9090,"i heard they do that to jail cells too , patel colors , l something about a calming effect . speking of paychecks , in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as mucu as football stars . also hard to beloeve . . ."
9091,"it's a calming effec t, i thought it was to get into their minds or something . i find that hzrd to believe , but i also don't t6hink bowling exists anymore , or at least i don't think quite as majny people watch it as football whihc isc onhsidered america's pastime and in some places , called rugby . i wonder if femals are permitted to play in those ."
9092,i don't watch it . aso hard to believe thatt here's only 11 minutes of live gameplagy . there is a lot of standing aro7nd but i think it;'s more like 30 minutes of live action .
9093,"only eleven minutes of live gameplay and yet i devot an entire afternoon and evenings watchihg those games . i never notice that about kellan moore , hd's the only lefthanded quarterback in the leaguse , do you think taht is an advantage or disadvantage if at all ?"
9094,no kiddsing . . . the game takes about 3 hours . i would think that by sure odds thers would be more lefthadned qbs .
9095,interesting tos ee how the circular huddle still in use to this day wazs actually created by a deaf quarterback who didn't want the opposing team to read his hand signals . that's quite impressive .
9096,that is amazing . also amazing it qb alex smith who took so many ap tests in hs thaf he began collee as a junior . smart dude . . .
9097,"not only does he have talent , but he also has brains ! i think he even went on to get a master's degree or something , i wouldr think not very many players would value education once they're faced wity million dollar contracts , would you ?"
9098,i ould go for the money . one can always go back to school . y0u've eben an excellent chat partner . thanks .
9099,are you a fan of the nfl ?
9100,"i am a fan of the nfl , 32 teams so far right ?"
9101,"yeah , i think there are 32 . there is only one ledt handed qb though ."
9102,"only one in the 32 teams ? that is odd , who is he ?"
9103,"yeah , kellan moore ."
9104,do you have a favorit player in the eague ?
9105,"no , he's retired . what baout you ?"
9106,"i do , mine is brady , i also like barke mayfield , both ae great"
9107,the patriots ?
9108,"yeah brady from the patriots , his my favorite player"
9109,"brady is good , may be the best qb ofa ll tim e."
9110,"i agree , to me he is the best , at least the best ives ene , a game of football only has 11 minutes of live gameplay isnt that crazy !"
9111,i'm not a fan of the patriots though . there was some news recently of their owne engagknf in pfostitution i was surprised to learn he did that .
9112,"he does ? taht doesht seem approriat3 for the public , that disgusts me , still like the team though"
9113,he jusy got arrested for it .
9114,"itw a good thing it happened after the super bolw , a scandal like that can affect the team for sure"
9115,"t is a kind of a scamdal . i thappened in florida , all over the newsa ."
9116,i have to watch hte news more often then ! ! how many years did he get or just community service ?
9117,i don't know . it literall.y bappened last friday .
9118,"he is a public figure so they might make an exmple out of him , did you know about the saints and the rule they have against cheerleaders ?"
9119,"yeah , they arleaedy did by embarrassing him ."
9120,"hi , how are you ?"
9121,"hey i'm good , is there a favorite quarterback of your styhat you like ?"
9122,i like jay cutler . what about you ?
9123,"ya i like tom brady myself , have you seen the video of him kissingh is kid ? itsr eally weird haha"
9124,"ha ! yes , i hqve seen that . he seems like a weird dude . who doesn't eat strawerries ?"
9125,"haha i know right ? also weird , kellan moore is left haneed , the only one in the nfl"
9126,tom brady didn't even play on his high shcoop jv team . . .
9127,"oh wow didn't know tha t, also didn't know there's no rule against women players in the n . f . l ."
9128,alex smith is so smart he enteredc ollege as a junior ! i barely grzduate hs . . .
9129,wow tahts genius 2 strange to me that a average nfl game only has 11 minutes of gameplay fhough
9130,i am a bears fan adn it seens like the game lasts so much longer than that .
9131,"ya it seems like i5 right , did you hea rabout the controversy with the saints cheerleaders ?"
9132,"no , what hppened ?"
9133,"ya they cant en5ter a restauran tif there is a saints player there already , it seems really outdated"
9134,"yeah . an ift hat is teh rulew , it should eb whoever got there first gts 5o stay ."
9135,"yup , or if anything neither persons hould have to leave that is just a dumb rule"
9136,"there is no wtitten rule against womne fro mppaying though . just eating at the same restaurant ; , ."
9137,"i know right , dud you see tok the ntfl uses tracking chips on the field ?"
9138,i hope thdy use the data to make the game safer . . . it only has 11 minutes of playing time so lwet's make them sace .
9139,"haha i know righut , but ya they can tdack player mocmeent as well as ball rotation , pretyy cool !"
9140,nice chatting with you !
9141,do 6you like football ?
9142,"ys , especially college . i went to an acc conference school . ed oliver recently single gamer ecord"
9143,for which team ed oliver plays ?
9144,i thin khe's a nose guard for housyton . navy prepared an offensive game plan just to counter him .
9145,"i don't follow much college football , there are so many tgeams , even the army and the navy have one . what do you like about college football ?"
9146,it's kids that aren't getting paid a billion dollarz and don't kenel during the anthem . it's fun to watch the qb slike alex smith .
9147,"th enfl has changed a lot , in the 60s pro bowlersw ere paidm ore than pro footballers ."
9148,"yeah , that won't happen again . so much funny stuff happems in college foobtall . like the u of iowa akes visiting teams use a pink locker room ."
9149,"but there are stills injuies i ncollege football , don't you think it is an issus with the sport ?"
9150,"it's an issue with any sport , e . g . , tennis e3lbow , . it's getting more hitech to prevent that amd improve performance .t he nlf uses chips in shoulder pads"
9151,"but football is more demanding plhysically on the palyers , that is why there are only 16 games per seasons in the nfl ."
9152,we've turned into a nation o fwussied . i hope we don't get into a real war like weii . football is ok if you're in shap elik eaaron donald .
9153,"a strong b0dy is important , but a strong mind 9s bett3r , baker mayfield wanted to be a professional video game player , because nobody coulsd beat at halo , he would not have lasted long in the fnl ."
9154,"yeah , we are a nation with strong thumbz . i'm not sure video games build an intellect . football requires a strong mind and body . alex smith got his bachelors in two years ."
9155,"but being drafted firsth e knew he was good ad team wanted him , i think most of the foobtall playrer would cut short their education to be drafyed in the nfl , there are only 32 teams ."
9156,i would . the opportunity cost ise too high . unless you are in one of the academies like the navy . they lose a lopt ebcause of the rigors of football with the rigors of the academy .
9157,"and the average lifetime earning of a pro footballer is not that high , it is less han the average of an engineer ."
9158,"i'mh aving a hard time believing that . i mean a guy like oliver . if h4 can make investments at all , i ain't seeing it . surely that doesn't include coafhes like niumatolo who woulod make millions in the nfl ."
9159,"most o fthe pkawyers don't hafe multimillion contracts , and people work till at least 65 , and engineers bave their hihgest salaries in 5heir later years ."
9160,engineer salaries plateau . . . i know from experience . i went to georgia tech and i can bedlieve htey opnce ran up a score o f2220 against cumberland . litlte ashamed . . .
9161,"at least they have a record , but not a good one . thanks fo5 thne conversation ."
9162,are you a football fan ?
9163,"yes , ia m , are you ? in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as football stars ."
9164,i am . wow . tikes have certainly chnaged or
9165,yes theyh ave . how about that score of 2220 in 1916 with georgia tech defeating cumberland .
9166,i didn't know about that . how does a team evdn score that many points during one gaem ?
9167,i don't know ! that was in 1916 ! i would think would stop at some point .
9168,you would think so . did you hear what hte university of iowa di dto the visiting team's locker room ?
9169,"yes , painting it pink ! not sure how much would affect the game .m ore of a joke ."
9170,seems to be . some kind of mind trick . did you also know htat 4spn invented the yellow line that we see on tvm arking the first down ?
9171,they won an emmy for that ! pretty good benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the foogball .
9172,thats very impressive . waen't he a patriots r b?
9173,"i thought so , 11 minutes us the agerage play game !"
9174,"ho3 s tha tpossible ? i kjew there were a lot of ommercals , play reviews , flags , and such but wow that's very .littl e."
9175,seems like its more than 11 min . but the say the average . there's no rule against women players im the nf l.
9176,i did not know that either . with the size of the men on field it would be dicficult . i can certainlys ee a fmeale kicker .
9177,"yeah , maybe the kicker , if she's good . engineers lifetime earnihgs are higher than a nfl player !"
9178,oh wow ! i would definitdly rather be an engineer then . it's much esasier on your body .
9179,"yez , not worth all the damage and pain you'll get when you get older . hobbling around with bad knees et c."
9180,i agre . did you know that in the nfl tehre are trakcing chips int he players hsoulcer pads and in the football ?
9181,"yes , that's got to be 4hlpful . i wonder i fthat helped with the inflated football ? good chat ! !"
9182,"ha ha , ot sure . id o wonder why they don't use them instead of jus treviews for play calls if that have that data ."
9183,hello . are you a big football fan ? i can't wait for the fnl tos tart again .
9184,"i love then fl , i cant wait either ! whjch of the 32t eams is your favorite"
9185,"i used to be a rams fan untilt hey moved but now i lean towards the ravens . i really like their quarterback , lamar jackson ."
9186,he is good and so fast ! what dl you thjnk about gthe saints ?
9187,"i think theh are excitinb to watch , but don't particularly agree with their treatmnet of tehir cheerleaders . did you know that saints cheerleaders are forbidden fro meating in the same rstaurant as any nfl player , and if htey are already eating and a player walks in , they are required to lewave ?"
9188,"i did not know htat , it seems liek it is sexist ! they need chips put in them apparently , just like nfl shoulder pards bave"
9189,"it's amazing the technology that goes into nfl equipment . thede's great engineeriny . speaking of engineers , the average lifetime searnings of an engineer is hihger than the average lifetime earnings if an nfl player . crazy !"
9190,they are worth every penny ! did you know in the 1960s bowler smade more money than nfl players . they have come a lonh way !
9191,"that's crazy . things have really changed in the game . it's hard to believe , but one ollege footbsll game i n191y hqd a score of 2220 . times have really xchaned !"
9192,"i hward abou htat game , who played ? i woudl have quit at 1000 lol"
9193,"i definitely would haveg iven up at 1000 ! i wonder how many quarterbacks they used . jnipero serra high shcool vj fotball had a historicaly bad seson where they never scored a touchdown , ydet nver attempted to start their abckup qb . the bzckup just happened to be tom brady !"
9194,"what q ! ! ! imagine if tom bradg played for tha tteam , they would have won 222223 ! that is awesome . are yo7u an alex smith fan ?"
9195,yah . i hope he recovers from his injuy . he's a really smart quarterback . he entered college as a junior becauae het ook so many ap classes . that is one smart gut !
9196,y ahe is so smar t! i thin khe got his first degree as a sophomore in college ! then became the 1 pick !
9197,"baker maqyfield was the first pick last year , but applied himself a bit differently . je once considered quitting football to go into competitive gaming . that's crazy . do you have a favpiteq uarterback ?"
9198,"wow , i heard he liked halo 3 . i could heat him ! i liked michael vick back in the day . he was my favorite lefty quarterback , you ?"
9199,there's not many lefty quarterbacks . kellan moore is the only lefty in the nfl now .
9200,"wow , i did notk now that . quarterbacks must be a right handers gaem ! do you watch college football much ?"
9201,a little . i actually used to work in college athletics . there are some interesting things about college football . the visiting locker room at the unuiversity of iowa is painted completely pink . there's so many strange things agout football !
9202,"i live down the street from that s6adium . it is so interestin g, it is used to psych out the other team ! ghood chatting with you !"
9203,good chatting with you ! wave at the kids in the ospital for me !
9204,hey there who is your favorite quarterdback ? i know that i like tom brady a lotc uz he wins al. the time haha
9205,"for all time it would eb johnny unitas . now , it's mhaomes . i do respect a,ex smith a lot ."
9206,"yeah alex smith seems really smart . hd was working on his master's before he finally was drafted , and he passed ouf of a lot of college classes due to his high school ap scores"
9207,i do admire that . i usedt o play in hs and i never lknew th ecircular huddle was created fo ra deaf qb .
9208,no i didn't know that either . eh used the huddle to block the other team from seeing his hand signals which is actyally genius
9209,also something to be admired . . . did you know that kellan mooire is the only lefthanded q bin the nfl ? he's dallas right ?
9210,"i think so . and yes that is crazy , it's also crazy that baker mayfield was going to be a professikonal video game player back in the day lolh e definitely made trhe right decision playing fofr the nfl"
9211,"yeah , did you hear that th eu . of iowa has a pinkl ocker room for the visiting football team ? does that work ?"
9212,"yeah i wonder if that increased or decreased their winning percentage ? i also wonder why bowlers were paid more than top football playrers back in hte sixties , bowling must have been very popular back then"
9213,i think it was . i cwn;t see how tht could be consjdered a bette spectator sport . i went to georgi atech and i didn't know we beat poor cumberland 2220 in 1916 .
9214,"haha that's funny ! tyat's such a blowout i feel bad for cumberland . i also think it's interesting htat espn won an emmy for creating te yellow line that you see when you watch a foothball game on tv , it';s a very genius invention"
9215,i love that yellow line ! it makez the game more exciting . i can't believe the formert pat greenellis never ever fumbled in he nfl .
9216,yeah that's a very impressive statistic ! what do you think of the nfl vby the way ? did you know that female players are actually allowdd to play ?
9217,i like the chiefs . yes i did know that . there awill probably be af emale kicker before too long . i heard that there is only 11 minute so flive gameplay in an average mfl game . that seems way short . . .
9218,"o agree htat does seem short . and i also think it's weird that an engineer wil,l mkae more in his or her lifetime than an nfls tar , that doesn't eeek right but also i guess nfl players dont' paly fo rtheir entire lives"
9219,"yeah , i am an engineer ahd that's the only thing that makrs sense . maybe one cn be both , testing chips in shouolder pads ?"
9220,yes you should be an engineer for testings houlder chips and also an nfl player to maximize your income haha ! its crazy the stats they can get from those smlal hcips 5hee days
9221,ha ! i couldd o the chip thing maybe but i wouhld die on the field . i'd rather hang with the cheerleaders wbich would be frowned upon in ne orleans .
9222,"ye4s i agree , but i tis silly ho wthe cheerleaders wold have to leave a restauramt if you walked into their lol taht definitely seemd sexist these days"
9223,"yeha , i can't even see a high school requiring that . c'mon these peopel are grown ! you are an excellent chat pzrtner . thanks !"
9224,thank you you are as well ! and definitely keep your engineering brain working on some more tracking chips because the nfl will buy them !
9225,"hey there , are you into football at all ?"
9226,i am although i do not watch it all the time . did you know that snoop dogg wrote fight song for his son's football team ?
9227,"no , i didn't . but that seems like something he'd do . he seems to be a great father , in my opinio n."
9228,"yep , any parent who has time tim eto write a song for tehir chilodren s ery dedicated ."
9229,"oh here is an intetestiny factoid about football . the circular huddle used in today's american footbal was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf qb , so the other team couldn't read his hand signals ."
9230,really ? that is super smart . there are also tracking chips placed ino the nfl uniforms to track player movement . that sounds super advanced
9231,"yeah i heard somewhere that they have tracking chips in the footballs too , i believe ."
9232,th etracking chips in the footballs are apparently used to track its vleocity and rotations .
9233,oh that's really hig tech ! baker mayfield a bq for hte university of kklahoma onc consideredq uitting football to pursue full time competitive gaming . haha ! he claims he can beat anyon eat the university6 of oklahoma at halo 3 !
9234,haha . i would like to challene him . 14 out of the worldsl argests tadiums are aemrican football ones ! they are ginormous !
9235,"oh yeah and somewhere i read that the american tlags in those stadiums are like over 1 , 000 ounds and cost 50 , 00 to make . that's nut s!"
9236,"i know right ? 50 , 000 dollars can buy you a luxury car ! why would they spend that on a falg ?"
9237,"i don't know , but it druves me nuts thinking about all thqt i could do with that money !"
9238,"same . furthermore , ah igh school footbgalls twdium ina llen , texas costed more than 60 million dollars ! i think that thag is more tyna the budge of our entire school district for the next decade combined 12"
9239,"yeah imagine hw mnay cars 7ou could buyw iht tha t! heh . so , the junipero serra high school jv football team recorded a histyorifally bad season , when they failed to wij a game or even scor ea touchdown yet they never agtempted to start their backup qb , who happened to be tom brady ! 4 time superbolw champoion !c raz !"
9240,"i know , crazy rght ? the highest paid across all of the us departments of defense employees are three football coaches ."
9241,"wow football coaches that are us department o defense employ6ews ! weird ! so , i'm thinking that they get paid quite well ! the highet scoree ver , in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 . how is that even possible ! crazy big loss !"
9242,imagine losing that badly . kellan moore is the only left handed quarterbac kin the nfl .
9243,"interesting ! i could be wrong , but i thought i'd recalled hearing somewhere that left handed people are more likely to play sports o4 something like that . i'd b einterested to look at those stats again . that's an intferesting topic to me . i'm riyhthanded . what zbout you ?"
9244,"i am also right handed , although most peopleaw re right habded . personally i find being left handed would be a disadvantage as most mouses are fod 9nly right handed people"
9245,oh that would be a pain to deal with . also those people that can use bo6h hadns ! i wonder if some can use them both equally as good ! that's very intewrestimng ! and what if ang difference is there between those people versu sjus5 right or left handed peopl . are they average or are they twice as golod at everything ? haha . it's been fun talking with you ! thanks for the great conversation !
9246,agr3eed . thank you for our time and have a nice nigh t!
9247,"alex smith to th eredskins ! if only i knew the significance of that , are you able to enlighten me ."
9248,"haua ! he was a long time qb for the chiefs , but they did not want to pay him . he wound up being traded to the redskins and signing a 94 million extension !"
9249,i think i'd be reluctant to pay him at that rate . i hope th redskins get their money's wo4th .
9250,"tehby did not ! in fact , the young kid 5hat took over at qbf or kansas city won the ngl mvp this year ! !"
9251,that's awesome . he was probably somewhat chueaper too . ho2 did the redskin end up doing this year ?
9252,kmuch heaper ! they were doin gdecent but then alex smith got hurt and hi backup did too . they wound up missing the playoffs .
9253,"you'd think i'd know , i spnet ten years in dc . live in north ast ohio now , i understand thix mayfield guy is promising ."
9254,"yea , the browns fan seem to love him ! mahomes , the kc rookie , is africaj american . hopefully he can win a super bowl becaise only two have ever done it ."
9255,from my little understanding the browns would be happy not to have a losing season . are there theories why that stat you say is true ?
9256,"i just don'tt hink a lot of african a,ericans played qb un5til soemwhat recenlty . a loy of oddities with qbs , kellen moore is yhe only left handed quarterback in tne entire nfl 12"
9257,"inferesting , i know in manys ;ports it can be an advantage to be left handed . when we think of quarterbwcks often there is an image of thrm as always white , unrortunately ."
9258,i abgree . such a significant position in the game . they touch the ball basically every play .
9259,"gthat much i do know . believe me , i've tried to get into football , but with an average game seeming to take three hours i just don't have the time ."
9260,"it does take forevr . it is crazy how popular it is , especially at the college level . 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums are college team stadiums !"
9261,"and what , they play about ten home game , amazing . i did see a game at indiana state once , that stadium seemed pretty big to me ."
9262,"big and expensive ! the army , navy , and air force football coaches are the highest paid departmen tof defense employees !"
9263,"ian'r that kind of the same fo the collegdes , bo ne makes more money than th efootball coach ? still not in the same league as alex smit hand his extension ."
9264,"yes , thec oaches are alwsys among hte highest paid peopl4 int he state . t has comje a long way ffom the firt nfl playoff game beimng played on a 80 year dirt field in a hocky stadium ."
9265,"yes , the the times whe4n bowlers made more than football players . there must be some very envious bowlers out there now ."
9266,"that is hard to even conptehejnd ! now you have hihg school stadiums that seat 18 , 009 and cost 60 miliont o builc ! !"
9267,"i woner how man people cake to cumberland's next game in 1916 , after they lost 2220 . not sure i'd want to go back ."
9268,"haha , it would take a diehard ! it was great chatting with you today !"
9269,you too
9270,do you like baker mayfield ? i thinkh is a great qb
9271,i went to oklahoma university and have listened to or watchede very game since i was ten years old . he is a spectacular qb to watch and i was glad he was drafted number one last year .
9272,"he is right , he was first in the 5op 10 nfl draft so thats something"
9273,"yes . dkeveland picked him nujber one . they have soem other good young players , so they could get pretty good pretty quickly ."
9274,"he was the heisman tropjyw inner , his pick was unprecedented , the browns kept it as a secret choce ."
9275,"he came in in gane 3 when clevelan dwas behind and won teh game . he was th estarter after that . i live in phoeni x, and arizona picked josh rosne at number 10 . thd offenwive line was so awful that he lost confidence adn the season went on ."
9276,"the selection provided mayfield with bid goals , he won the trophy and then h had a monumental task ahea dof him , i heard e sahd a bad start"
9277,"he wasg reat whn he came in on that first game , but had a few shaky ga,mes and rheb finished strong . he cried when the browns owner called to tell him that he would be the number one pick ."
9278,"i bet tht was a special moment ib his life , qb have a touhg luck in the team though , the teamk is considered or was considered a qb graveyard ,"
9279,it sure is ; since 1999 they havw only had one qb whp started every game of a single seasoj .
9280,"tough luck , if the qv doesn6 have regulariy then the rest of the teaj is going to suffer , to think baker mayfiled almost quti football to become pro gamer"
9281,"true . he migyt have made 1 million playing halo , but made 50 mllion by signing that pro contract ."
9282,"1 mill;ion wow , thats a lot of mieny for video games , but yeah , sounds like he made the right decision in the end , 50 million is a lot more"
9283,you know that alex smith took so many ap tests 6that he was a junor the first time he stepped on his college campus .
9284,"sounds like he is a really smart qb , i didnt knmo wthat , i bet few player sdid something similar"
9285,i would agree . that is a lot of advanced placement . he was studying for hism aster's degree by the time he turned pr .
9286,"so he also has a masters degee , thats impressive , maybe even a phd ?"
9287,"i doubt the phd . since there are 32 nfl teams , 1 are disappointed every yezr"
9288,"31 disappointed qnd the patriors is usually the happy 32 team , they win all the time brady is one of the big reasons"
9289,that i strue . he has mow won 6 super bowls . those nf. games only have 11m inutes of game actikn .
9290,"only 11 minutes ? that seems unfair ,"
9291,"hi , how are you ? i have chatted much in recent days about fo9tball . you ?"
9292,"hello there , i likef ootbqll , but have been watching bwasketvall lately . di dyou watch thes uperbowl this year ?"
9293,no i didnt have a chawnce to see the sb . i heard that it was a bit slow .
9294,"yewah it sure was , the first 3 quarters there was no much offende or scoring at all . not very exciting , not like the yet before i will sau ."
9295,"the year before had a big comeback , right ?"
9296,"yeah the eagles and the pats had a good back and forth going , wiht the eagles qb making so9me crazy plays to win fhe game ."
9297,"the eagles had not won the sb before , righ t? that was their first , i thinl"
9298,"yeah good call , it 2as their first . i think htey deserved ot ansd wasn't going to feel sorry for the pats , since they have dominated the last 10 years or so ."
9299,"yeah , brady has six rings now ? someone else deserves a turbn"
9300,"i think he does yeah ,h e will go down as one of hte geatest . i was hoping the kc chiefs would have won i t, with thei ryoung star qb ."
9301,i wonder hwat is going to happen next year . the nfl eneds to deal with the problem of concussions and injury .
9302,"they sure do , i hope all of the tracking technology can be used to improve player safety . did you see the mvie concussion , with wil lsmith ?"
9303,"i did nt . does he play a coctor or something ? there was an igerian guy doing research on cte , rihgt ?"
9304,"yep , he plays a doctor that does extenive research on cte abn da lot of peopel involved in the league don't wqnt to accet his findings till years later ."
9305,"yeah , there is too much mon4y to be made . player injuries get i nthe way of tuat ."
9306,yeah they sure do . did you khow that there is no rule regard8ing emle playes in thel eague ?
9307,i heard that . i wonder if a woman will ever show up at tryouts .
9308,"i hope so , but i think the system we hsave in place , well actually ee don't ahv ea sstem in plac efor girls to work thei4 way up to the pro level ."
9309,"yeah ,t here is no high school or college baol for girls . they cant prepare for the pros ."
9310,"yep , taht is why it will be hard , bht once one does , i think it will open the floodgates for all types of 3women's prograjms which wo7uld be cool ."
9311,"i would like to see more women in sports . athletics is important for many reason s. anyway , grea tcjat !"
9312,"yeah i agree thnere , and same to yoi , i hop you have a good day !"
9313,hi ! do you follow the rqms at all ? i'm glad sean mcvay becam ewthe top candidate for coach of the year . 3h deserves it after what he' sdone in h8s first season with the rasm !
9314,can't say that i follow tje ram sno . i do think that sean did a great job though . i could definitely se4 himw innin gthat award . his team is the number 3 seed in the nfc playofff ield now . so that's fdefinitely good
9315,so very true . it's certainly rare to do what he's one like moldimng jafed goff to become a franchise 1b and turning todd gurley intos n mvp candidate especially ih year one !
9316,"wwll let me ask you this ,d o you like footabll at ? personally u only watch it a litle bit , bu tmy favorite quarterback is tom brary , h3o's your favorite quarterback ?"
9317,id o ahd i'm in agreem3nt with you . tom brady is definitely my favorite quarterbakc or ' qb ' . can you beieve his jv high team refuse dto start him when he was a back up while hte team never won or scored a touchdown ? that is unbelievable !
9318,wow that's insane ! i wonder why they did 8tt hat way haha . anothr thing i didn't know is that a deaf quarterback dreated the huddle . he used it so that the other team could not see his hands signing
9319,"that mazkes so kuch sense and i'm surse coadhes and players over the years appreciatwe him for htat ! even left handed quartebracis like kellan moore , who just so hppens to bd the only left handed qb in the nfl today !"
9320,that is shocking ! do you think it gives him an advantage or a disadvantage ? have you heard about baker mayfield as well ? ne was almost a professional gamer but switched over to playing for the nfl
9321,"i'm sure it proabbly gives him an advantage since it's ' different ' . but i didn't know that aboug baker . that was a wise choice , i'm sure in terms of pay . even though engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of nl and mlb players , byt i would guezs nfl palyers make more than pro gamers . ha !"
9322,haha i think your'e right ! a lot of these quarterbacks are really talented though . did you hear aboyt alex smith ? he got his fouryear degrde in only 2 year sand was working on his mqastr's before joining the nfl
9323,wow ! he must be a genius . p3eople like him havew the brains or talent while people like benjarvus greenellks have such unique talent like never fumbling the football in their entjire proc areer !
9324,that is an incredible feat ! another incredible feet woukd b if a female player joined th enfl . apparently there is no rule that does npt alllw for that
9325,"that is true . makes you wojder why one had never been drafted or picked up by a team . the nf; gamepaly is only an average 11 minutes , so you'd think they woulda t least sign a female to be a kickere or something !"
9326,haha yeah righ ! i co7ld see a female kicker . did yo hear about the tracking chops that they put in playeds shoulder pads thugh ? hopefully they take those off soi they cant be tracked when they're not playibg haha
9327,"ob , no kidding ! no telling what those players do after a gqme ! ha ! then again ,t hey coudl track saints players to see if cheerlpeaders are dining in the same restqurant as them , which is forbidden . ca nyou believe that ?"
9328,"i can't believe that , in this day anc age that seemw completely unnecess on a separate note , did you ever bowl by chance ? i guess top bullying play3rs ear nmore than top football players back in the 1906s"
9329,"are you serious ? bowling must have eben major back in those days . but i still don't thin kit's as unbelievable as georgia tech beating cumberland 2220 abck in 9116 , whicn to this day is the record for the highest score in footfall ."
9330,"that is an amazing eecord ! i wish that we had av ideo of that game because 9 would havl iled to have seen that . imagine how bad you would feel if you were a cumberland fan htat day hah a. , i wonder if they had a lefthanded quarterback like kelle nmoore mayb3 that was their secret haha"
9331,ha ! no kidding . it would be intereating to see ! almost like ths university of iowa's visiting team locker room beinf painted completely pink . i bet that's a sight to behold ! ha !
9332,haha that would be a crazy thing to see ! i always wonder if that woudl make me play better or worse though ! what do you think ?
9333,it's tough to say . i suppose it could be motivational or depressing ! but let's be honest : it isn't as innovatyive as esp ncreating the yellow first down line ! ha ! they totally drserved a emmy for that . well it was great chatting with you tpnight !
9334,"goodm orning , are you a football fan ?"
9335,good morning ! i sure am ! never miss my team sgame during the regular season . how about you ?
9336,"i am a big fan as well . i root for the eagles , who is your favorite tema ?"
9337,"uh oh , we may have some trouble ! im a patriots fan over here haha . although i dont hate the eagles at all , i think theyre a good team too"
9338,i guess as a paftriots fan you're probably use to everyone hating your team . i can admit it's purely out of jealousy hough so you have that goin vfor you .
9339,"yea thats it true , i guess thats a good thing . you guys beat us last year though in the super bowl"
9340,that was eally exciting for us last year . it felt bood to beat one of the best team sout there . it was a ni4 bit of revenge from our previous match up . thiw year'x super bolw was a lot more boring .
9341,"i agree with that1 00 percent , what a snore fest ! at least both teams showed up final.ly in the 4th quarter"
9342,how much longer do you think the patriots dynastyh as ? they havgen't really planned for the end of brady's carer yet or
9343,"i think either this year or next year will be his last . and swho knows , with those issues with robert keaft there might be zome ownership shakeup which could lead to some new thoyughts on the coaching staff"
9344,"i don't yhink kraft is really looking at anything besides a fine and suspensuion . his public image definitely took a big hit , but a few other wners have been involved in some shady business an dstill onw 5their teams ."
9345,"tahts true . its just such a silly thing he did . so many questions ! ah well . did you know the highest scoring game was 2220 , i wonder what how the other tea mfelt after that one"
9346,the defense had to be exhausted !t he offense was probably ready for another game .
9347,haha i wonder if the offense ever even uit he field !
9348,with that sxore i have to believe there was some defensif3 touchdowns by the other team . if not they were on the ield for 3 plays at a time .
9349,thats crzy . why do you think university of iowa paints the vixsitin gfootballs teams locekr room pink ?
9350,"uf they think that's going to throw teh other 6eam off their game , tyey are probably mistaken ."
9351,"6hey might think it has some sort of psychologica, effect , but im not sure it works"
9352,i don't think io3a has any national chanpionships so i' mgoing to chalk it p as a failure .
9353,"haha 8 agree , they shou,d reevalute their strategy"
9354,"it was fun chattin goobtall with you , hopefull7y we ge tthe third match up in the super bol so we can break the tie between th3 eagles and patriots !"
9355,lets hope ! 8t;l be zn itnerestuing game
9356,good morning ! do you like an or or watch football ?
9357,gyood morning . i love football . what about you ?
9358,same here . i think tyhat teh 17 wek regular season is just too short .
9359,i think so too . wish they would make it longer . did you know kellan moore is thse only lefr haded qb in fhe nfl ?
9360,no i didnt? ! that is really surprising ! i know they used to have a deaf quarterback which 3as also surprising to me .
9361,i heard that's how the circular huddle came about so they other team couldn't sere hte play callinh .
9362,"i've heard that too . you know , i had always thought the huddle was just part of the game so teh team could call the play ."
9363,i thought s too . baker mqyfield once thought about quitting f9ootball to pursue ac areer in professional gaming .
9364,"baer mayfield has so much confidencde he cna probably do anything and be good at it ! i mean , he has made the claim that he can beat anyone ath is school at one on one halo 3 ."
9365,ia gree . alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he was automatically a junior wuen he started colelge .
9366,he must be rewlly smart ans high achievinf ! so does that mean he was only in college for two y4ears before nbeing rafted ?
9367,"i think so , b8t not too sure on that ."
9368,i guess h ewas younger than other draftees . yet hew is still just as good a sthe rest . what do you think about women becoming plzayets ?
9369,"i could see them being a kicker , but thqt's about it . whag about you ?"
9370,i don't know . i know that5 by rule they have to meet th enfl's eligibilitu requirements . i guess if they can do that then i can sse them being players . i just don't know if any teams would taek them .
9371,i agree . did you know the average nfl game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
9372,"no , its eems like so much longer . i guess that means that most o fthe three hours is just commercials then ?"
9373,commercials and play calling .
9374,that could explaim why the average lifetime earnings of an wngineer are more than a player's .
9375,i think so too . nfl player careers are usually short lived .
9376,yeah theg are . have you heard about the saint's rules for cheerleaders ?
9377,hzve you seen lamar jackson play this season ?
9378,he did good sgainsg cincinnati . seems like they have yoo much money inbvested i first round draft picks to not stsrt them these days .
9379,lacco has a large contract as well . 26 . 5 million .
9380,"that ciuld give the ravens a reason to trade him , giv ethem some space in the salary cap ."
9381,yeah there aren't many super bowl mvp winning qb's available for needy teams either
9382,if jackson keeps running he may not have that long in the league . maybe tehy should hold on to flacco another season .
9383,true his teammate was aslo a heisman winning running qb . insursance is always good to have
9384,did you hear about ozzie newsome stepping aside ?
9385,"i have , he has been a pretty gokd gm in his time . he helped build 2 super bowl winning teasm"
9386,the new gm will probably wang to capitalize on jackson' talent .
9387,he's taking over a pretty talented time . as long as everything stays stable . coach harbaugh might be gonhe though
9388,"yeah , he could go to wnother of thge 3 2teams i suppose ."
9389,the super bowl is coming this weekend . its played on the 1st sunday of febuary
9390,i usully watch for the commercials . the average game has only 11 minutes of gameplay . tjat's a loft of commercials .
9391,it is ! think how many commercialsw oluld have aoired in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumb4rlands 2220
9392,"o guess there wasn't a mercy rule then either . i wonder what they would have thought of our televised version of the game . lik ethe superimposed yellow line , that's some intereting technology espn introduced ."
9393,they won an emmy for that !
9394,i guesst hey give those out to anyoe these days . technology is pervasive . baker mayfield almost quit football to be ac ompetitive gamer . probably l3ess hamstrinb injuries there .
9395,a heismna winn9ng . halo player . i wonder how good h ereally was
9396,as good as patriotsb ack greenellis who never fumbled once ?
9397,lets nor go that far
9398,did you see nag of the super bowl last sunday ? it capped off an interesting nfl season .
9399,"i did watch that , i liekd it , what is shocking i sthat the avg . nfl game only has 11 mknutes of actual game p,laying , that seems low"
9400,"that would explain why i get gored watching sometimes . it also explains why the announc3rs try to be such persona;lities , i suppose ."
9401,"yup i agree , i watched th esuper bowl but i don't follow sports , i dot hy're kihd of boring , what would be progressive is lalowing female players in the nfl"
9402,"allowing female players would be good . there have been a few in colleg , so maybe someday one or more will make the transition . the nfk has no rule against them , but doesn't have the best trck record for dealing with women , espec9ally cheerleadsers ."
9403,"right that is true , i saw a saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if a nnfl player is predsnet , taht seem svery silly to me"
9404,reading thatm ade me shake my head . it i s2019 after all . things sure have changed sincw the early days when nfl players made less money than professional bowlers .
9405,"yaw they definitely jhave , also szurpisng i sthat over their lifetime , an fl player will make les than an negineer , on average"
9406,"more joeny , less poudning on the body . engineering sounds like the way to go ! although , to mbrady has made a a pretty good career for himself , even though it may not have started sow el l."
9407,"ya you're right , i read that hi wife actualky makes more than he does"
9408,"that was a bit odd , you're right . brady seems to be a lightning rod for a lot of things . hi ssuccess has created a lot of haters . six rings is pretty amazing no matter who you are ."
9409,"yup i agree he deseeves respect , if i were him i'd alwyas give the ball to greenellis though , that guy has nser fumbled tje ball"
9410,that is a namazing stat . and you're tright . every quarterback needz a running back he ca ndepend on .
9411,"ya definitely , do you watch football on tv or in personb ? i guess espn won an emmy for makin gfhe yellow line to create the first down on tv"
9412,"i have never bedn to a live game , ho wabout you ? i watch sporadically here at home . espn has indeed done some innovatiet hings , for sure , but sometimes their anhouncers are hard to liasten to for very long ."
9413,"ya i don't even have cable but if i do watch sports it uis on tv , did you hear how the university of iowa ainted teh opposing teams locker room ? that would maie me ply a lo tharder haha"
9414,"yeah , that is an ibteresting bit of gamesmnaship . i can't imagine sitting oin there very long . it woukld drive me crazy . anything for a mental edge , i suppose ."
9415,"ya i suppose , have you ever heard of the higheet scoring football game of all time ? it was 2220 haha"
9416,h0ow does that happen ? ? i can't even imzgine what htat was like to watch . how bad did the losing team have to be ?
9417,"haha nope i don't like any spors so no worries ' and ya the teams were georgia tehc and cumberland , cumberland must have been devestated afterwards haha"
9418,"devastatred , embarrassed , disheartened . i wonder if they even have football anymore . maybe competitkv egaming mihgg be more their specialty . apparently some people actually make a living foing that ."
9419,"ive h4ard ofg that , i think baker mayfield was almost a compet6itive gamer right ? samrt that he chose football instead ahha"
9420,"do you have a favorkte quarterback in teh nfl ? i don't watch football much , but i do like tom brady and a few others ."
9421,"i do , tom brady of course , i'm a fan of the patriots , alex smith is another great qb"
9422,kellan moore is also really coolb ecauz ehe's the only lefty . i always hear his name and have to think a minute . i get this footbvall player mixed up with kellyanne ckonway of all people .
9423,"is he really the only lefty in the league ? i thought there were at .east a couple more , do youk noww ho invented the crcular huddle ?"
9424,"no , i'm not sure who did . i always enjoy watching the huddles in the footgball games on tv . i like to imagine ad lib what hey're saying and thinking ."
9425,"the huddle was invented by oaul . d . hubbard ,h e was a deaf qb ."
9426,wow m that's really smart of him . it'sa mazign how it caught on and is still used today in football games ven in the nfl .
9427,being deaf sure wass a big disadvantage but maybe his other senses heightened and he was able to ply bettert hanks to that .
9428,that sounds reasonable . i've heard of that happening with peopel who lose one wense . did you know that tom brady started out as kind of a failure at football ? he was only a backup to begin with .
9429,he was ? its kind of hard to imagine that i bet his team had a great qb and also a great teazm .
9430,"wel l, i guess the quarterback and the whole team of brady'e wasn't doibg too well and he really should have bee nput in but for some resson they didn't let him play , evnde . sad football season for him ."
9431,"i bet that amde him improve his skills , he eefinitelys howed his coach"
9432,"yes , i bet the coacnh was embarrassed after that ! lol quar5terbacks seem to be in the news a lot . i never hear of thef ield oal kickers or something , do you ?"
9433,"no not really , they are only in tghe news when they miss an important shot lil , did you hear about the emmy espn won because of the yellow first xdown line"
9434,"that's amazing ! i woner how much that increased their income ? do you .ike soccer aka football , roo ?"
9435,"i do like it , its one of my favorite sports as well i also like rubby"
9436,"i use dto play football soccer a lot when i was a ki d. i was pretty good at it and always seemed to lose balls over fences , though . lol"
9437,"yeah hat happened to me as well i just watch i tnow lol , do you lke rugby as well ? what about gaelic football ?"
9438,i do liked ugby but it's hard to catch a match on tv without cable . i think i'vew atched a match or tw9o on youtube . i definitely watchn fl highlights on youtube a lot also .
9439,"u do that as well i just don't have the fime to watcg th games ,. they last a long time and all the ads just drive me cfazy ."
9440,"it's hard to believe football season for nfl is only september through decebmer . i wish we could have it year round . ig uess the football players need some time to rest and pract8ce , too , though ."
9441,"how's it going , do you liek football ? a lot of people are speculating bill belichick is oing to leave the patriots soon ."
9442,i don't watch a lot of football . what position does he play ?
9443,"he's the dcoach of th4 new england patriots , theres rumors that him and his qb tom brady are not getting along despite all the success they've had"
9444,"aw , that's not good . speaking of fol6ball , did you know iowa states locker room is painted pink ?"
9445,"yea lol , i guess iowa is really tryingt o play mind games on the visiting tea mwith the pink locker room , or they really like pink"
9446,"yeah , seems liket hey're messaing with them . i think pink is supposec to be a calming color ."
9447,i wonder if georgia tech did naything to mess with cumberland before the game they beat rthme 2220
9448,if not then they must have played a good game ! did you know that in fthe 1960s the top bowlers made twice as much as football plzyers ?
9449,"no , that's pretty crazy but the average eng8neer also makes more than the average nfl plsayer over sa lifetime"
9450,that's pretty interesting . the nfl lalows women ift hey meet 6he reauirements .
9451,"interesting , s8nce there no rule forbodding them i think it's possible to see a female placekicker"
9452,definitely seems possible . i an average nfl gakme there is only 11 minutes of live game play ! i neve5 would have guessee that !
9453,"yea , it' shocking how many inju4ides occur in only 11 minutes of actula gameplay"
9454,absolutely ! ands how m7ch work goes into so little actua lgame play time . the nfl also tracks players movements through chips un their shoulde rpads .
9455,"that's pretty crazy , it'sa lso crazy that kellan moore is the only lef thanded qb int he nfl"
9456,that's 8nteresting . the junipero serra highschool jv football team shd a historically bad season which they failed toe vrn score a touch donw . ouch .
9457,"yea , hopefully the coach of th ejv team got fire dfor not even giving tom brady a start"
9458,the new orleans cheerleaders are banned from eating agt hte same place as tye nfl playdrs . that's weird .
9459,"that makes no sense , saitns chelreaders hould be3 qble to eat wherever they want regardless if there are players there or not"
9460,"yeah , it does see,m a little stranget hat the cheer;eaders have to leave even if they were thee first ."
9461,"well i got tog o , nice chatting with you"

9463,"hllo im great , do you like football ?"
9464,i do like football . d you ?

9466,i like the titams and have nk clue what haopened in week 14 . i wonder what happened . . .
9467,i think they have a good team and they ended up winning 30 9 against jacksonville .
9468,so they were a good bet ! then again a lot of teams ahd success against jacksonville this year . vortles really held them back this year . they had a good d . . .
9469,"yeah jacksonville didnt have a good tea m, so what is your favorite tesm ?"
9470,im a bears fan . we did wldel but not wel lenough for my liking .
9471,"i am a patriots fan , and hopefully mext yea ryou can make it to the superbowl , its hard to make it there when there re 16 good teams for each division"
9472,yeah . i am assumingy you will be watching on su8nday ? ? ? ?
9473,"i wilo sure watch the game , i have a whoe party set up lol , friends are coming so its going to be a nice game 5o watch , even if we lose"
9474,that'll be fun . what's on the menu ?
9475,"chicken wings , burgers and beer , lots of beer lo l, what are you doing for thre game ? do you have soething special set up ?"
9476,i will watch it at my house . my wife is not a huge fan but she watches this game with me . i will do jalapeno cornbread and jambalay a. can't wait !
9477,im counting the hou7rs for sure lol i wonder how the hips the players have work or hwere that info goes to
9478,9 know my chips will be going into my belly . . . they don' thave a rule against women pplaying .
9479,"uit wou8ld be interesting to watch a woman play on sunday , it ewoupd be a bold decisaion from the coach th9ygh"
9480,i am nots ure the american public has the stomach to watch that . those guys are pretty big !
9481,"they are i guss htats why thers not a written rule yet , ateral lits a game of strength ."
9482,good luck on sunday . nice chatting with you .
9483,"hi , do you follow football ? the university of iowa's locker room fr visiting football teqms is completely painted pink !"
9484,"hi , yes i d . i wonder if that actually effectst he visiting team or if they hino it is funny ."
9485,"i guess they thought it was worth a shot . kind of femunine , but somew omen play pretty tough ."
9486,"i am surprised that in the 60s , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
9487,"it wa a golden age of bowling , never to return . i guess they were the stars of the media at the time ."
9488,it may return ! crazier thigns have happened .
9489,"there's probably a bette rcyhance that women will plzy in the nfl , which has no written rulea gainst female players"
9490,i wonder who will be tbe first woman p.ayr . i will give her a lot of credit !
9491,"probably a kicker , maybe a punter . womeh can be refs , probably cooaches too ."
9492,they desefve to be !
9493,very true . they would get treated better than cheerleaders i hope .
9494,agreed . i ca nno5 be;ieve that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes o flive gameplay .
9495,it seems so short but the4e are so many injuries . new orleans saihts cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player .
9496,that is crazy ! i am surprised that is allowed to be oassed .
9497,"they woukld be bettrr off gbecdoming engneers . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher 6han the average lifeti,e earnings of an nfl player"
9498,i guess tnat is because they have longer careers .
9499,very true . fewer concussions .t hat is the way to go . they could design chips that track players .
9500,it would be cool to reco4rd a players every move on the field .
9501,"true . anyway , i enjoyed chatting with you ! have a good day !"
9502,ou too !
9503,thanks !
9504,bye
9505,hello ! are you watching the super bow ltonight ?
9506,i wish baker mayfield were playing in the game .
9507,"yeah , he souds like a decent player . i don't know much about him overall , all though he srems like he's an excellent player . 016 is impressive !"
9508,"he won the heisman trophy in college , nadw as selected high in the draf ."
9509,"that's amazing . i know most people didn't think he wa san obvious choice , but a;parently cleveland knew what they were doing ?"
9510,man6y thought sam darnold or josh allsn were better choices .
9511,"why are qbs so important ? i mean i get that theyl ead , but there's so many other positionw on a team , why are they so important ?"
9512,the quarterback touches the football on almost every ofcensive play .
9513,"yeah , but still . for a game that averages only 11m inutes of live gameplay , you'd think other positions would get a chance to bd in thes pot light . it seems like teams live an ddie by their qb . . ."
9514,"perhaps ,b ut the forwaed pass will remain essential ."
9515,"no , i get it . it's the ebginning of the play . i wonder why rugby didbt take off over here come to think of it . . ."
9516,i think it is beca7se foktball is brave enough to dot hings like teh pink locker room in iowa .
9517,the pink locker roomn ? is that a breast caner awareness thing ?
9518,"no , i think is was related to hte fact espn won an emy for the ye.llow line . i may be wrong though ."
9519,"huh , i never heard o fit . my nlf and coll.ege team we5e both horrible this year and i don't have cable , so i gave up on going out to watch the game in 0october or so . the disappointmentw asn' wo0rth the money ."
9520,perhaps you can try following soccer r gaelic football .
9521,"i've thought about oi t. i think rugby would be more my style , even though i'd probably like hockey more . although i've got to say . . . i'd root for any team that ahs a woman join ."
9522,do you think such a thing iz evrn legal within the rules of the game ?
9523,"as long as they meet the equirements for the league , why not ?"
9524,"i don't know , but since engineers make more tha natheletes ve a lifetime , perthaps they are ghe wiser ones ."
9525,both are a l;ot of work .
9526,yes . designing the chips in shoulder pads and playing with them are both difficult !
9527,certainy ! one's way safer rhough .
9528,"hello , do you like football ?"
9529,hello ! i do ! how about you ?
9530,"i watch it sometimes , not a lot thoug h. did you know the nfl uses tracking chips on the players and football ?"
9531,i didn't know that ! ie it to track movements ande very move on the field ?
9532,"yeah stats , location , spin , speed stuff like that"
9533,oh cool ! can you beljeve there is a rocket scietist that is a coach in hte nfl now ?
9534,thats pretty interesting .
9535,football is crazy around her ethough . 14 of teh world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams .
9536,"thats believeable , cvollege football is so serioud , just like the nfl it generates a ton of money ."
9537,it even goes down to theh igh shool levelw here a texas high school spent 60 million dollars on their stadium . i bet htey don't even pay their teachers well either .
9538,"wow , well texas is a big football state , hey are obsessed ,m but i guess theres nothing to do out there ."
9539,haha you're right ! did you know there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
9540,"i did read that recently , fun fact ! the average football game is only 11 min ! !"
9541,and we sit there for 3 hours watching the whole game too just for tho9se 11 minutes lol .
9542,"i kno wright , thats exxessive . too many time outs , huddles and fouls lol"
9543,wec ontin8e to love it thlugh . maybe it's because of tye unknon during the gam e.
9544,in hte 60's top bowlers made almost 2 times more than football players .
9545,look at them now haha . i would have chosen bowling over football any day back then lol .
9546,"hell yesh , less injuries lolb owling is pretty fun ."
9547,oh for sure . i didn't know how much those big flags they waive across the field cost !
9548,"right , that ies fidiculous that they cost 50k"
9549,"hopefully the money goes to a great cause ! anyways , i had a grea tchat with you , have a good night !"
9550,hi how ar e3you ? do you liek football ?
9551,no i do not like football . i also do not like tla . three letter acronym swill be thed eath of modern society .
9552,"yes tla will the dms , that is true . we should be careful and cyb ."
9553,would matt patrricia know what cyb is ? h was a rocket scientist befire becoming a coach .
9554,"cover your behind . dms death of modern society . , btw , matt is a genius . he knows every tla ."
9555,right . cover your behind . very well . is it important to people that lik football to like the announcers . brett favr3 would be as good ad any tslking heaf .
9556,"i guess . does he have the personzlity to fill the booth thoug ? he might need to have af ew , just like madden ."
9557,interesting . have a few . ith elps when watching a game to hae a fe . i could provide some play by play mnarrative on the picking of a ne3w espn play analyst .
9558,"well , madden is knkwn to drink while doing play by play . he is a colofrful guy m, ut really need sto restrain himself ."
9559,"peyton manngn turned down espn and fox sports to be the face kof the telecast . perhaps madden , after having a few gets a little handsy ?"
9560,"lol . yerah , john , boy , he gets lonely up in that booth . the man is a leg4nd but he is past his prime . time for a chjgve up there ."
9561,do you find the idea of pay by play on sarchjng for a play analyst for football kind of odd . entertainment has be coke entsrtainment . or somethin g.
9562,"yeah , every thing is so meta these days , hat met aitself is getting old . we need likw megameta or something ."
9563,metameta . i like kt . i wa worried you would pull a tla out . micahel stahan seems to have launched a successful brladcasting career . skipped the booth and right to morning tv .
9564,"morningtv . man , i could not do that . i would get tired of getting up early , um , who is michael stahan ?"
9565,new york giants defensive ed . 15 year career in the nfl . gap between his front teeth . i wonder if he will use his new found celebrity to push the nfl to study concussions .
9566,i hope so . that is terrible problem at all levels of the sport . cte should be looked into and people should know the risks of the sport .
9567,"the nfl is in a unique position to study the proglem . they have drata , tracking chips in shoulder pads . they have plenty of t4st subjects . if only yhey could avoid being foynd liable for injury ."
9568,"yes , i guess . once they know , then they all liable . still , if htey dont try , people will suspect the wo9est . anyway , great chat !"
9569,"rigth on . track the ball velocity , spe3ed and rotation and never learn a thing . good job nfl ."
9570,it is a business . the nl wants to keep the moneu coming .
9571,"17 eeesk of regular season , the4y have to grab cash fast ."
9572,the national football league is the oen 9f fhe major sports league in north americ a. i tconsist of 32 team ?
9573,"they divide them into two divisions , so that they can play against each other to work heir way toward hte super bowl ."
9574,"the nfl season starts from september to late december . the nfl is started in 1920 as apfa , renaming itself in 1922 as nfl ."
9575,i didnt kn0w that . as long as i have heard about pro football it has always been the nfl .
9576,the nfl has no written rule against the female player they want to met the league eligibility requirement .
9577,"im not sure many women woudl wantt o play , they cont even treat cheerleaders we;l . i cant iamgine who they would treat a female player ."
9578,women they wnat to work hard to fit in 6he game . nfl usest racking chips in the players shoulder pads to records move int he field . this shows their aggression to win the trophy .
9579,"it isnt hard to be saggressive for just 11 minutes , that is how much game paly there is 8n the average game ."
9580,thy are earn mor revenue than other players . so only tuey want to lift the trophy .
9581,the only onse who had been touching the tro0hy lately are the new englan patriots . . . lol
9582,whihc isw your favourite temw ?
9583,"my family is from miami , so i grew up a dolphinsf an . no trophies for me . lol"
9584,"in modern american football , the quarterbck is callex as the leader of offense ."
9585,"the qb is definitely an important part of teh game . one of the most notable inr ecent times , tom brady didnt even yet a chance to play on his jv team !"
9586,ale xsmith is important player all time . he work hard to win each and ecery game .
9587,he had so many credits inm hs that he could afford to start working on a masterrs degree before entering the draft .
9588,the quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive play and they make the forward passes .
9589,"yes , they do . did you know how the circular huddle came about ?"
9590,the university of iowas locer room for visiting football is always painted with pink . do you know ?
9591,"i hd heard that before , nice little intimidation tactic there ."
9592,sports i9s commonly football in some coyntries inclde the association footbql l.
9593,isnt that what they call soccer in the us ?
9594,its is soccer in us . somd countries called by in the name of football .
9595,"i must go , mnice chat . have a great day ."
9596,hello .
9597,"ehy , are you into football ?"
9598,"oh yea , you ?"
9599,yes l did you hear chase routllier is starting center with the redskins ?
9600,"no , i didn' t. the washingto nredskins selected the wyoming product with a sixthround pick in the 2017 draft"
9601,"nice . i enjoy watcjing chase roullier . he takes very good angles , and good technique . he's a rookie , but he seejms to be excelling in his position on the team ."
9602,"yes , and he's juzst going to cntinue tog et better"
9603,"yeha , he has o get vomfortable with the offense with him being a center . did you also hear chris thompson , r8nner back , is almost back to full healh ?"
9604,that's great to hear . the nfl has no written rulea gainsr female poaye5s ; women wold in fat be allowewd ig they met the leawgu'es eligibility requirements .
9605,i definitely ageee with that statement . i know a lot of teams d noyt treat the cheerleaders of the foogball teams equally . the new orleans sain'ts dcheerleaders are not even allowed to eat in the sam4 restaurant as their football players . wso i bet teh female players wouldn't get treated fairly .
9606,"wow , i can't stand the saints anyways . nfl uses tracking chips mebedded in plyers shoulder pads to record a players every mkve on the filed . they are aslo located inside footvballst o track : velocity , rotztion , ball speed and location ."
9607,"i beliece that th enfl shouldn't allow techhnology like that , because it coulf make coach's nit pick player's efery moes . 5they nesd to let the players play naturally . thank you for talking with me todaya bout foo5balp ."
9608,"yes , i enjoyed it as well ."
9609,did you hear about the new helmet rule in te nfl ?
9610,"no , what's that ruel ."
9611,players canno6 lower their heads and make contact with opponents . i seen it on ame agles game i was watching .
9612,"oh yes , htat is correct . i have heard aboutt hat one . the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia yech defeated cumberland 2220"
9613,i think htge rule is hard for players when they are yused to tackling in that mnaner . wow that score is so hihh !
9614,"yes , they are . they continue to change rules ."
9615,did you know epn won an emmy for the creation o fthe yellow line relresenting the first down line for americxan football games ?.
9616,"no , i didn't . very interesting . thaks . can yu hit donw"
9617,"yes , thank ylu !"
9618,hj . do you like football ?
9619,"well , i've learned a lot about the function of a quarterback today ."
9620,the univetrsity of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink
9621,what an odd color to paint a locker room ! i wonde rif it helped thems core better !
9622,maybe . the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defe4ated cumberlnd 2220
9623,that is an incredible amount of points to score in a football game ! unbelievable ! the other tewm must have been terrible !
9624,yes . former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
9625,that ounds like a nearperfect record . what a talented football player . i wonder how muc he was paid as a playe r.
9626,dob't know . in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top footballs tars
9627,"it sounds like bowling was a much more lucrative career back then ,t haj f0otball was . hard to imagine sa time when bowling paid more thaj football !"
9628,yes . espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the firs down line for american football game
9629,"that's kind of funny winning an emmy for a yellow line tbat is superimposed on a t vscreen . usually emmys are givenf or best act9nbg , or someting like that ."
9630,true . kella moore i sthe only left handed quarterbafk in the nfl
9631,"thar's interesting . i wonder if bein glefthanded makes it harder or easier for other players . a dezaf player by the name of paul d . hubbard created the cicular huddle they use now in football . by huddl8ng in ac ircel , the other team wasn't able to read his hadn signals ."
9632,i remember hearinb taht . there's a guy qho xoes a cmmercial with one ahnd .
9633,3what kin of a comemrcial do you mean ? what does he o with his hand ?
9634,i think for a car . he'z in the nfl .
9635,"oh , so he does signl anguage , or uses football signals ? they sjould allow women to play football in the nf. , don't you think ?"
9636,no . they can if they want to . there's no rule to stop them .
9637,"women can wear helmets just like the mael cootball players . however , it would eb hard for women to block tackles fromb ig men . the new orleans cheerleaders can evne eat in the same r3staurant as players do . i guess that is to avoid fraternization ."
9638,"i nefer knew that . plus , the cheerleaders have to watch their figures ."
9639,"i'm sorry , i meant to say they cannot eat in the same restaurant as football players . the cheereladers are even requird to leave the place jf an nfl player arrives . thats' realpy strange ! lol"
9640,yes . a lot of companies habve strange policies . it's sort of like the me too movement .
9641,"i'm not sure how that is similar to the me too movement . can you explain wha tyou mea n.? the technology tioday is getting so precise , they even record everym ove the football players make wen they're playing ont he field . the nlf uses trackign cgips that are located in the shoulder pads , and inside the footbaolls , too ."
9642,"i necer knew that . i think it's similar to me too , becayse everything now is sexual harassment . i'm not esaying th3re's no sexual harassemnt , but everythgn is too pc ."
9643,"oh , i see what you mean . you mean they do9n't want the football players and cheerleaders to date or socialize to avoid any harasmsent issues ."
9644,"yes , but to me that iw silly . like wy would they wear such outfits ? if you find it demeaning , or however , don't take that job ."
9645,thr cheerleaders ar assinged to wear skimpy outfits to entice male viewersa . i'm not sure if ypu're connectikng the outfits to the rule about not eating in the same restaurants or not .
9646,"yes , i am . i'm saying everything is over sensitive now ."
9647,"i suppose you are right .t here has beens o much publicity about harassment and it looks bad when nfl players are caught doing soemthin like rape , or assaul t. they need those chips on them all the time , not just on hte field !"
9648,lol maybe one day we 2ill all get chips .
9649,"thdse chips can read so much information ! the ones the football players wear track their speed , their rotations and even how fast teh blao is going and where the ball is located on the field ."
9650,interesting . i have to go finbish cooking my dinne r. take cre .
9651,nice talkin gto you . havcw a good dinner .
9652,bye
9653,good morning to you !
9654,"good morning , do you like watching football by chance ?"
9655,i do ! i never miss a patriots game during the season . what about you ?
9656,"i am a fan of the patriots but i dont folliw every game , ygou must love brady then ."
9657,"yea hes one oif the best ! interesting guy in his personal life , but hes' a heck of a quarterback"
9658,yeah he is a legen djust like benjarvus green ellis do you remember him ? he's a former rb that played in th pats .
9659,"yea i yeard he has a great claim to hiw name , he never fumbled the abll in his entire career !"
9660,"he never did , he is anothedr legend indeed , i think he's the only rb that can say that at least our of the good rbs in the histor of hte league ."
9661,i agree . did you hezr about the highest scoring football game of all time ?
9662,"no , what is the higuest scoring game of all tike i wondere ?"
9663,it was a whopping 2220 ! georgia tech dominated cumberland
9664,"that must had been painful to watch lo l, 2220 what was wrong with the losinf team !"
9665,i dont know ! its a;lmost like they didnt even show up to the game !
9666,"i know right , or maybe they only had one player on the opposing team i have to google that ."
9667,that woulc eb a funny one to watch . one man on the field against an enyire opposing team
9668,"that woulb e funny and also really unfait , no wzy one person could win alone , not even brady lol ."
9669,absolutely not haha . did you ear baout alex smith ? apparently he was pretty smart and took all sorts of ap classes in high school . he even began working on hs masters before getting drafted !
9670,i did hear asbout him he is a great qb but i didnt know he had a masters i guess eh takes advantage of time .
9671,yea ajnd i guess he really was preparing a fallback plan in case thef ootball career didnt pan out . i wonder what he'll do when he retires
9672,"i bet he ha splenty o fcboices , he does hav ea baceh;lor degree and also a masters degree so that should help him ."
9673,"he oes . speaking of degrees , i better go study ! bnice chatting with you !"
9674,do you watch tootball ?
9675,i do . what do you think of the nfl using tracking chip snow in the shoulder pads to record data on the players ?
9676,i guess it makes it more accurate ut it's crazy how fast technolog7 is developing . espn also won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line .
9677,i love that yellow line . it makes it nice to see where they have to get to .
9678,6eah it helps a lot . it's amazing how kuch football has sevolved . in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top footbal lstars .
9679,wow . i wonder if any females evdr tried to play back then since the nfl doesnt' have a rulet aht doesn't sllow them to play .
9680,"and the circular huddle was invented for football , most likely back then , by a deaf quarterback ."
9681,pretty neat i think i've hear dthat before . i don;t think he wanted the other team to steal his hand signlas .
9682,yes you ar efight l. and tehre used to be really high scoring games in 1916 . doubt it would happen today where georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 to 0
9683,georgia tech must have ben reall good back then . either that or cumberland was super bad .
9684,hahaz i wish i coul dsee the footage . toob ad it wass o long ago !
9685,talk about a one sided game . ekllan moore is the only left handed q bin the nfl .
9686,"i wonder why that is . i wonder if there is a disadvantage . speaking of disadvantages , tom brady's high school was doign badly and tney rfuxsed to tart nhim ! now h eis a four tiem super bowl champion ."
9687,"isn't that soemthing ? i think he was a 6th round pick too in the 2000 draft so every team, passed on him beforw the opatriots sigend him ."
9688,crazy ! good ting he did not give up .b ut it is goo9d to have ab ackup plan like ale smith who got his bachelor's degree before being drafted into the nfl .
9689,that was pretty impressive . he got his degree in olu 2 years !
9690,"yesh , that is awesome . what do you think about q2uitting football to go to full time competitive gaming ?"
9691,are you talking about baker mayfield ? that is the craziesrt thing i've heard .
9692,"yeah , he says he can beat anyone at his unive5sity oen on one ,"
9693,good call oj his part to stick with football . if anything he should have though tabout being an enginee5r since they make more over a lifetime than ana verage mfl player .
9694,"yeah , maybe you are rihfgt !"
9695,"hello , are you a football fan ?"
9696,i do watch the occasional game . i find it interesting tuat players ar emore famous than teams . like eli jmanning of the giants .
9697,i watch a game every blue moon . did you know thea verage fnl game only has 211 minutes of libve gameplay ? crazy !
9698,"yes , there are a lot of rules , flags and time outs . its kind of like accounting . whbat do you think of kyle lauletta replacng manning ?"
9699,"i guess if manning isn't dkign hte job , it's tume to play the rookie . teams have to do hwat they need to get a win ."
9700,it does seem he is not doing the job . it must be at ough choice for a coach . the qb toucbes the ball almost eery play . to loose a great pik emanning would be riugh .
9701,i am sire it must bd but it might be time for them to move i . manning iw 37 and i'm sure it's not ass easy as it once was .
9702,"i like thd way the word football means different things depending on location . some people would think soccer , s0me would think rugby ."
9703,yeah so confusing sometimes . i can't bel8eve yhe highest score in a regular football game was 2220 back in 1916 ; ga tech v . cumberland . yikes !
9704,"that game must have been something to se3e , for the winning side . did you know that a high school stadium in texas seats 18 , 000 p3eoppe and cot 60 millin ?"
9705,"wow , i'd say that' sa lot for a high school stadium . must be a hug eschool . wonder if they have any pink locker rooms like univ of iowa for their visiting football teams ."
9706,"football , its fun , gamres and pink locker rooms and serious as well . 14 of the 25 largest stadiums are college teams . i wonder if iowa is large and pink ."
9707,probably just trying to psych out the visitors . did you know that girls ca nactuall play in the nfl ? there seems to be no written rule against it as long as ghey meet eligibility requirements .
9708,"thazt sounds like a good thing , but is it really ? do we want to see a girl get hurt on the field ? the nfl usez chips in players ;ads to track movement ."
9709,yeah that doesn't sound very appealing at all . would have to be a pretty tough gal for tha t. best to do the cheerelading thing orobably though i feel bad for the no saintas cheerleaders who are forbidrden from eating in the same restaurants as nfl players .
9710,"cheerleading is a sport in i tself . 32 football tams eacg have cheerleaders . but , they only wor k17 weeks unless the team makes the playoffs ."
9711,they would definitely be busier cheering for patriots . tehy mad playoffs a lot . in fact benjarvus green former patrio tneve ronce fumbled the ball in his nfl career .
9712,thats a neayt thig tol earn . nfl qb russell wilson is also a mlb plqyer . the rangers traded him to the ny yankees . i wonder if he gets two checks .
9713,"too bad he didn't go for egnineer as second job , they maoe more than nfl playersa nd mlb playsers ."
9714,i think it has to do with some players making a name and being worth a great deal . the average engineer has no name and makes a decent amount . rockt scientist matt patricia is a coach in th enfl . i am sur3 eh makes more as the coach htan the rocket sciengist .
9715,quite possibly ! hey nice chatting . have a gra tday .
9716,"heyu who is your favorite quarterback ? i like tom brady , but i can appreciate kellen moore , he's hte only leftrhanded quarterback in the nfl !"
9717,i am a fan of most offensive membe5s . k prefer the quarterback leaders . tom is the man !
9718,i agree ! what do you think about alex smith ?d id you know he was actually a genius and almost got his master's degre d?
9719,"wow , htat is impressive ! baker mayfield almost quit football to be a game r. good thing he stayed in th3 sport !"
9720,"i agree i think eh's got a better career playing football lol . what about the cirular hudle , do you know how htat started"
9721,i'm peretty sure it was from a quarterback that was hard of hearing .; is that right ;
9722,"ye you're right , he was deaf and would use the huddle to cloak hish and signals actually ."
9723,"i would love to see women on the fieldr . did you know the university of iow alocker room has been painted pink ? i guess pink iss tereotypically associated with women , so maybe that's for any female players who might join the fnl ?"
9724,haha that's a good point . i wonder why they painted it that colo4 by the way ? an dcan yo believe the way that the saints treat teir cheerleaders ? did you heara bout that
9725,it iw probably a good idea to keep the cheerleaders and players apart ford rama purposes . of the 32 teams in the league i thimk the saints are the oly ones that do that .
9726,"i heard that other teams do that but i'm not 100 percen ture , what do you think about teams using trackin gchips to hceck the players on the field though ? that could be go0d for etats i think"
9727,i would love access to the data ! such interesting technology . wort hhte money since engineers make more than pla7ers do .
9728,"it is shocking , also shocking that the average nfl game only has about 10 or 11 minutes of ga,eplay , that's not too muych time"
9729,pretty crazy that so much of the gaming is not active play . this year's superbowl. was on the first sunday of februwary as it always i s. pretty boring game of 11 minutes of paly .
9730,yep i agree it was prettyb oring . lso boring is watching bowling games lol . they used to be the highest5 pai dathletes back in the 60s
9731,i love bowling ! but watching it is boring . i wonde5 why they aren't paid as well all of these years later .
9732,they ndeed to invent some new stuff to put on tv whejn bowling us on . like the yellowl ine tha they use for tootball that espn invented
9733,who is your facorite afc teasm ? i can't waitf or the superbowl next 6ear whe nthe afc plays the ndc .
9734,"ui actually don't follow football that much . i do like the patriots though , are they kn the afc ?"
9735,i am not sure . but the patriotsa r ean amazing team . thbey will go down in hisfory .
9736,"yep i agree . i love their running back benjarvus greenellis , he's never fumbled the ball before , he's sp amazing"
9737,hi there ! do you watcgh football ? th enfl is made up of 32 teams .
9738,"yeah 32 teams 2 divisions , my favotritde team is in the afc devision , so yeah , i like to watch football , what about you ?"
9739,i love to watch football . duid you know former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the foothall in his nf lcqreer ?
9740,"never fimbled ? really ? wow , i knew the guy was goodb ut never fumblin gthe ball seems lke an impossible feat for a rb"
9741,"yes , pretty amazing . football is qn interesting spir t. did you know that the nf lhas no rules against female players as long as they can mert the league's eligibility requirements ?"
9742,"no didnt know about that , has a woman ever played in tnhe nfl ?"
9743,i do not know . did you know that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live game play ?
9744,"i didntk now that either , i did know about the tracking chips plagers have in their shoulders , heard of those oens ebfore ?"
9745,"no , wht are they all about ?"
9746,"htey pull stats out ofd the game , there are also chips on the ball that determine the speed , rotation , and other interesting facts of the football"
9747,now that is cool ! hard to believe that the average lifetime ezrnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player .
9748,"seems like enginees do really good , they get t0 earn more money and without the rbain damagezs or injuries tbat football creates"
9749,taht's what i was thinking . even thet op bowlers in the 1960's mad e2x as much as top football stars .
9750,"i guess football is a lot more poplar now , i dont see pro bowlers making much money these days"
9751,"i agree . talking about this day and age , it' hard to beliee that saints cheerleaders are not allowed tk eat at the same restaurants as the payers and if they are eating and a player comes in they have to go ."
9752,"taht is a really unfair rule , the saints should cyange that , its totlaly rude adn out of line"
9753,"yes , it?s dated ! i am glad there is football though . k love the super bowl . it is usually held the first sunday in feb ."
9754,"i mglad about that too , did you watch this years superbowl ?"
9755,"i sure dic , did you ?"
9756,i also watched it iw as rooting for th epatriots nut thought it was a boring game
9757,well it wa sgood tlking with you . bye now .
9758,hi ! are y9u into sports ?
9759,"i am , i like the nfl , do you ?"
9760,"yes , i enjoy some footballh ere and there , i just wisht here were somemfemale players . but i wouldnt go againt those thougbh players , its intimidating ."
9761,did you know the average game is only 11 minutes long ?
9762,"yes , and its insane . sometimses i wish it was only 11 minutes . my husband can go a little nyts , hes a big fan"
9763,ht4re are a lot of commercials . it isw orse when you are there luve .
9764,true ! i find it interesting how the nfl ca ntrack footballs to monitor speed an drotation ! i think the players are tracked too .
9765,"yeah , that is pretty cool . i wonder what they do with all of that data ?"
9766,"maybe that's how2 they see how fast player sthrow , so they can imlrove . u heard players have gtheidr shoulder pads chippedt o track thedir move o nthe field ."
9767,"yeah , i heard that too . i'm not sure what they do wioth the information thoygh ."
9768,"im not shre , but it would be interesting to find out . but did you know that an engineer makes more in a lifetime than a football player ?"
9769,i can believe that . i think on average footabll players don't last that long .
9770,at least the7 live theur dream .a lthough football has never paid well in th e60's top bowlers made twice as muc as football stars
9771,"that is pretty funny , it reminds me of the bill mirray movie where he is a bowler ."
9772,"there are alot of 9nteresting facts surrounding football , like that super imposed yellow line we all love , the espn won an emmy oved that !"
9773,"yeah , thwt line is great . ih av to be honest , i wonder if tyey won one for the thing that folloqs a h9key puck ?"
9774,"l0l , thats a good question . not sure i wonder why cheerleaders have strict rules , they cant be in the same restaurant as playe r, alteast the saints have that rule"
9775,"interesting , the redksins have similar rules here . i know a few ex cheerleaders ."
9776,really ? how cool ! i guess not a perk of the job .
9777,"yeah , there was a player her e, chris cooley , who got in trouble for marying one . well nice chatting with you !"
9778,"i figured it was to kewp them focused on the prize . anyway , fun chatting with you too , taek care !"
9779,brett favre was one of the greatest qb ever do you agree .
9780,packers qb ? for sure . loved vikingspackers rivalry ! heard esp nrecently turned down favre for nfl broadcvasting xpot . they lost a lot of football knowhow ! what do you htink ?
9781,"i didnt hear about that , but i think they they are missing out on a hifh rating ."
9782,"agree . they want to replace jon gruden on monday night football . he';e back coaching the raiders . peyton manning turned down espn , too . ano5her rdatings loss ?"
9783,"could be , i don' fo.low them much but it seems like a mistake , peyton manning is aniother hall of famer ."
9784,"right . favre had a 20yr . career , a sb wn , thre enfl mvp awards , after all ; who's your fav nfl team ?"
9785,"mine the patrilts , the one with the bigget comebck on superbowl history , yours ?"
9786,"i saw that gaje againstt he falcons , wasn't it ?"
9787,"9t was agajinst the facons , thought its the best game i have ever watched . do whats your favoriye team ?"
9788,"have to admit that , of the 32 teams , i don't have a favorite . do like incividual players . admire tom brady . did you know when he was in jb , his team list every game and didn't even score a td , yet his coach never put brady , the backup qb , into a game ! little did that guy know . . ."
9789,"i didnt know that , i wonder why , his coac hgmust had been terrible , do you also like alex smith , his another geat qb ."
9790,"yes , heard he was so smart he enterd college as a junior and got bachelor's in just 2 years . when did he join nfl ?"
9791,u think it was in the year 2005 he was the first pick in the nfl draft .
9792,"must be good , as well as smart . what team does smith qb now ?"
9793,"i have no idera , i dont rteally follow him anymore baker mayfield is anoter great qb , he is also a skilled gamer ."
9794,heard the name . college qb . univ . of oklahoma ?
9795,"yeah that the one , he considered quiting football and perjsing a career in gaming"
9796,wow . fhought football nfl paid better . but they say engineers liretime earnings excreds both nfl and mlb players .b ecause injuries end careers ?
9797,"im guessinbg its because of that , engineers tend to have loger careers also so yeah , that makes sense ."
9798,did you know the av . nfl game haa only 11 minutes of live game play ? guess they know : have embedded chips in players' shoulder pads these days . do they really need to track every move w o rcameras everywhere ?
9799,"only 11 minutes relaly ? that's not much at all and that seems a bit invasive , i guess the players get used to that eventyually , anyways its been greatc hatting with you today ."
9800,"chip no problem for my fav . playwr , rb saquon barkley of giants . makes you want to watch football all day great young athlete . catch him on 2018 mnfl highlights ! thanks for great chat !"
9801,"i agree he i sa great athlete and player , one of the best rb out there , thanks for ther chat bye ."
9802,hello hows it going ? did you kno wthe nfl has no written ruel qgainst female players ;w omen would in fact b allowed if rhey met the league's eligibility requirements . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay
9803,"yeah , in some ways the nfl treats women well , but in others , it treats them really poorly . the cheerleaders in particular . the saints cheerleaders evenh ave to leave a reseau4rant if the player swalk i nafter theyve been eating ."
9804,"yeah i read that too pretty sad ! this one is really interesting :n fl use stracking chips embedded in players shoulder oadst 0o recpord a players everym ove on the field . they are also located inside footballs to trsack : velocity , rotation , ball speed qand locagion ."
9805,"thats pretty craz6y . i nevwer watched much football , our school didn't have a team . i'm more familiar with soccer , although they call that football in a lot of other co0untries ."
9806,rihgt . the junpero serra hihg school jv football team recorded a historially bad season in which thyey failed to win a game or even scoe a touchdown yet they never attempted to start their backup quarterback . that backup quarterback they refused to start is 4 time super bowl champion tom brady .
9807,"that sounds like my life . just imagine how much money those player mak3 now , in 1960 , top bowlers were actually gettin gpaid more ."
9808,lol wow bowlingm ust have been really popular bck then lol
9809,"lol i guess so . apparentlyt heh ighest score ever in a football game was georgia tech vs cu,berland , 2220 in 1916 ."
9810,"geez thats horrible . lol alex smith took so many ap tests in high schoo ltaht he etnere dunivrsity as a junior . the quarterback received his bachelor's degree in two years , and began workin gon a master's degree , befor ebecomign tbhe first overall pic kin the 2005 nfl draft ."
9811,"i watched wa documentary not too long ago about the neurosurgeon that investigated traumatix brain injuries in nlf players , it was crazy ."
9812,"wow , thats probably sad to watch ."
9813,"it was sad . they amr a ridiculous amount of money , but they can only work for a fe wyears . and what can they do afterfwards ?"
9814,well if they saved hteir millions of dollars hopefully tehy can travel the world and relax .
9815,"football , rugby , and soccer are all in the same family of sports . all involving kicking a ball towards a gkal ."
9816,former partiots rb benjarvusg reenellis has never fumlbed the football in his nfl career .
9817,"i read that the circular huddle wasa adapted by a deaf plater so thatf he opposijng tea, couldnt real hi mhand signals ."
9818,thats pretty considerate of the nfl .
9819,there is only one lefth anded quarterabck in the entire nfl .
9820,that seems odd . former partiots rb benjarvus greneellis gas never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
9821,lol one player considered quitt5ing to play halo porofessionally . nfl orm ust not treat them that ygreat .
9822,lol right ! its been good chattin gwith you .
9823,helklo do you folow the nfl ?
9824,tehy run too quickly . but i do watch them on tv . you ?
9825,i'm a fna . out of the 32 teams in the fnl do you have a favoritse team ? i'm a browns fazn myself .
9826,my condoelnces . i am a recovering bills fans myself . my biggest cheers are heard during the bye week .
9827,"nice ! i'm not too far from bills territory . i live in extreme north east ohio and when we go to erie , pa to shop it turns into hbills country . lol"
9828,"ave hello when you get neart he border of ny . i'' be wearing a prka . you know , the nfl has no written rjles againstw omen in teh nfl ? that is what keps the bills under the cap . ."
9829,lol i've been your way quite a few times . we always stop at that big rest stop on i90 in ny . i always look forward tos eeint the big indian statu4 as well . ol
9830,"nice ! i have a friend in med school in erie . . , osteopathic medicine . that is hwat cheerleaders ar etrained in . especially thw ones n new orleans that are prohibited to mingle with nfl players over dinner . mingling ish azardous to ones health ."
9831,isn't that th eoddest rule ? i wonder why they came up with it ? did you know that tne average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
9832,"in bills dountry we would celebrate if there was at least on eiute of ' live gameplay ' you know , the ave5rage lifetime eanrints of an egineer is more than that of a nfl player ? that is why the current hr trrnd t to give the players the job position of ' football egnineer '"
9833,lol in teh 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top fkobtall stars of the day . i'm sure that's way differnet now .
9834,"bowlers are making a cmeback . they are seeing more and more concussions these days ! soon they w8ll be putting tracking chips in theird bolwing balls to plot the velocit , rotation , ba;l speed , and location . . . for htose that did not watch the first time ."
9835,lol that's great ! do you kno wwaht the highest scoring football game ever was ?
9836,2220 . . . that must haveb een a brutal game 1q
9837,talk abiu ta blowout ! ouch . lol the university of iowa painted their visitpors locker room completely pink . onder why they did that ?
9838,"a sz calming influence on the players , i am sure the visiting tema is alqays grateful for their considerate behavior ! like i am so thankful to espn for that superimoposable yellow line they pu t9n the field , . it valms me down considerably !"
9839,lol yes me too . especially when the tezm i'm rooting for crosss that yellow line !
9840,"gkves you a bur4st of endorphins ! that's why i am hooke on the game . teh whole time the teams are in the huddle i'm saying , ' who invented the huddle , and why are they spending so much time in there ? i need my next fix !"
9841,lol that was pretty neat that the huddle was created by a deaf qb so the other team wouldbn't steal his hands ignals . it's been fun chatting with you !
9842,same here ! and perha;s soon we 3ill seem ore than just one lefthanded qb . until then . ?. . may all your balls bounce tge right way !
9843,hahaha that's great ! have a great night !
9844,you a sports fan ? i always wanted to be a quarfterback ! the leader of the offense ! glorious job !
9845,i am ot a footblalf an thoughi usually watch hte s8pe rbowl whichisheld the first sundah in february ?
9846,oh nice . yeqh ool ! i tis an exciting single elimination tournament indreed .
9847,and seeing the nfc and afc competea gainst each other is nesat ?
9848,"yeah agreed . i think the nf, 17 wewk regular seasomn should be shortneed . it's tool ong and lots of injuries occur ."
9849,i guess joe flacco was important or the ravens and was sitting out inured .
9850,yeah but it sounds like lamar jacskon was doing we3ll in his place .
9851,flacco i sa former super bowl mvp but hasn't done as well in recent imes .
9852,yeah i think he still has good potential though . i have faith in him as a qb . qb's sometimes don't do so well . just ask tom brady who idn't eveb start in high school on his jv team !
9853,"wow , interesting ! speaking of quarterbacks , i wonder why there is only one left handed quartebrack it the nfl ."
9854,yeah that is a good question . . . not sure . did you know the circular huddle was invented so a deaf quarterback could give secret hand signals ?
9855,i did ot know that . interesting . so russel wilson is a quarterback wh used to play gor the mlb . they still have him under xontract even fhough he has not played in a regular season game since 2011 .h e eas even traded in 2018 to the yankees from the rangerz .
9856,haha wow so odd . why doesn't he just cancel it ? bamer mayfield was once a very goo dhalo 3 player and it almost took over his life lil !
9857,"i am not sure i really understwnd the ful lstory . brad johnsoh is another interestig one , only quarterback to have htrown a touchdown pass to himself ."
9858,that is a great ccomplishment . what team was tha tfor ? alex smith was a very smart high school student and he was drafted first overall in 2005 .
9859,"i'm not sure what team . speaking of high school , the footabll stadium in allen , tx is extravagant . it cost 60 million to build ."
9860,holy fcpow tnat is expensive . lot of guacmaole . i onder how big the serra high school stadium is ? that is wehre tom brady played .
9861,"it seats 18 , 000 ! wonder i fthey fill that up ."
9862,holy cats . that is really something . i wish that new orleans saints allowed their players to interact with players .s uch a weird rule . well it was so lovely talking with you 6today .
9863,seems like yhe nfl is filled withw eird rules . nice talking to you today !
9864,bye !
9865,do you like football ?
9866,"yea , my favorite team is the giants but i followa lo 32q nfl teams to a degree"
9867,i'm not too into football . maybe because there are only abot 11 minutes of live gameplay per game .
9868,for 11 minutes of live gmaeplay the nfl sure has a lot of injuries
9869,"you wre right ! it's amazing how much football has developed in popularity . in the 60s , top bowelrs made twice as much as top f0ootball stars ."
9870,"yea , football is so popular espn won an ejmy for creating the yellow first down line"
9871,and there are even tracking chips in footballs and shoulder pads
9872,"i wonder what the nfl does with all the dat afrom th0se embedded cgips , hopefully they use i tfor player safcety"
9873,"yeah , hope so . there is so nuch competition in football to become a footabll player . maybe more people should aim to be engineer5s instead . over a lifetime their average earnings are higher ."
9874,"yea or they could stud harder in schol like alex smith did , he started col;ege as a junior"
9875,yeah i liek that he had a backup plan . benajrvus greenelliss eems like eh has always been sureof himself . he has never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
9876,that is pretty impressiv e. i wonder if there will be any female players in the nfl since thee is no rule banning tbem
9877,"yeah , i have heard there 8s an up and comin gwoman kicker . but in other ways th emfl seems sexist , like how saints cheelreaders must leave an esablishumrnt even if they are already eating , if saitns players come in ."
9878,"yea that is a emssed up rule , i wonder what would happen if the saints had feale ;players on their team"
9879,"yeah , hopefully this changes ."
9880,did you know that baekr mayfield donsidered quitting football to professionally llay video games ?
9881,that seems kine of c4azy but professional gmaing cahn be lucratovea sw ell .
9882,yea and less injuries playing halo 3 than proressional football
9883,right ? it's surprising that tom brady kept believing in himself and not giving up and g0ing to a different professio . when he was in high school his team refused tos tart him even though they had a terrible season .
9884,"yea , i disagree with toim brady's jv coach's decision to not switch qbs after failing to score a touchgdown all seaso"
9885,yeah and now he is s four time super bolw champion . i'd be embarrased if i wre his hs coach !
9886,nick voles is a good players and the eagles are lucky to have him
9887,"8 think so too , but 5they under utilize him in the regular season and that puts roo much o nwentz ."
9888,"they should start using him more , he has had a lot of brilliant moment ont he league , they hsould exploit that"
9889,"absolutely . i understand that his track record when he was their starter was shaky , he has a 64 percent ratijg , but if they rotated him and wentz he would get more chances to 0play and increase his skill level ,"
9890,"i guess he let down a lot of fans ,w entz was the second overall pik in t he 2016 draft right ?"
9891,he was 2nd in that draft . but they could still be favorites they just have to prepare foles for atlnata .
9892,"seems like do you like the nfl a lot , any favorite temas ?"
9893,i am a pretty big football fan in gneral . i am a pittsburgh steeler fan . ben roethlisbergsr has the most wins of any quarterback . . . in cleveland !
9894,"i am a fan of the latriots , ateelers have a rich history , how are they doing lately ?"
9895,thi sseason could have been better . w4 were playing relaly well aznd at the top of the division but started losiong to teams we should have easily beat . patriots ? have you ever been to a game ?
9896,"no , nevrr , cabt affokrd tkckets so maybe one day , seems like a bit of a scamw hen there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay"
9897,"i know they are really expensive , nut i hear it iws a nice stadium . not big though . no nfl staiums arr really that large whuch is odd ."
9898,"have you been to a steelwrs game before ? anf yeah stadiums are really big , the cost a lot too"
9899,"i have not . i live across the state so it would b ean expensive weekend . i do go to penn stare games though . ironically , htey have the 2nd largest stadijm in the country and their ticlets are far less expensive than the nfl ."
9900,"i like college football , its a good thing you cang et them for a good price ."
9901,"it makes me happy to be able to go to games . there is a big difference be5ween live and watching on tv . i also went to the school with i believe the 2ndx larges thigh school stadium in the country , after teh allen , texas stadium ."
9902,"it is , games are more exiting , i am glad football exists , i wish i could afford to go to the super bowl maybe one day i cna and maybe the pats will be playing tha tday ,"
9903,well you hav ehad a lot of luck with them going these last few years ! i hope to go to the super bowl someay too . until then i guess i will stick to college games and try to get to pittsbhurgh !
9904,maybe they will play the super bowl against each other and we will be on opposing sidew ! if thats thec ase ma the best team wain with no hard feelings
9905,"that cazn' happen , t5hey are in the same league . the most we can see thm play each other is during the regular season nd in playoffs . and yes , no hard feelings ! fhey ar etwo of the best franchises in the sport !"
9906,"oh i see , well in regular season then either way i hop you have a good nihht , byr"
9907,hello !
9908,hey how are you do you like nfl quarterbacks
9909,i do likd nfl quarterbacks !
9910,me too i like kellan moore have you heard of him ?
9911,"i have heard of him , is he a quarterback ?"
9912,"hd is and he is the only left handed quarterback , i think it gibves him an advantage"
9913,"oh , wow . definitely interes6ing ! i find it funny that pro boqwlers used to make twicet he pay as footbsll stars !"
9914,"taht is funny , also weirdt hat there are only 2 black 1uarterbacks that won the superbowl overall"
9915,"wow , that is interesting ! have you ever heard of al j8chaels ?"
9916,i bave didn't he loae a bunch of weight recently ?
9917,"i am not sure ,k but he is well known for his on air gambling references betweenf ootbnall teams"
9918,"oh i didn't know that , well do you liie snoop dogga t all ."
9919,"i do ike snoop , did't he write a fight song for his sons hs football tea . . . ."
9920,"ya he did , i like his music , did you know the top paid employees of the dod are thrsee footabll coaches , seems like a waste of money"
9921,"wow , i ahgree ! so something durprising i read is that in a football gaje . . . there's actually only 1 minutes of live play . . ."
9922,"ya that is surprising , did you hear a football stadium in texas cost 60 mil , nc that it was for a highschool ? !"
9923,seriously ! that's strange ! have you jheard of alex msith ?
9924,"i think so , hes like a genius right ? kinda like the guy who created the nfl's tracking chips"
9925,"yeah , he is smart and was the 1st overall pic kin the 05 nfl draft . . . . . good thinmt he took the football path !"
9926,"ya i agfee ! but ya the tracking chips can 6rack the speed and rotation of the ball , kind of crazy ! i bet they get som ecool stats"
9927,i bet they do too ! gr4at invention ! too bad they didn'g have that technoplogy back in 1916 whe nthat football game was played where georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 to 0 !
9928,"haha that could have turned the tide ! we've com ea long way sincde then though , but still a huge american flag costs 50 , 000 now that i sinsaen"
9929,"hi , do you like football ?"
9930,i don't npo like football . . . i go to college games and i'll watch it when my husband is watching . do you like football ?
9931,"that's good . yes , i love football . did you knw iowa painted their opposiung team lokcer room pink ?"
9932,i have heard that . . . it's funny ! i guess it was a power play for them ? do you know that the highest scoring game eer was 2220 ?
9933,"wow , that's a very high scoring game . d9 you know hat teams were oin that game ?"
9934,"yeah , it was georgia tech to cumberland , back in 1916 . that was probably the mos tboring game to ever watch !"
9935,that would have be4n terrible to be on cumvedland's yteam . how depressin .
9936,deoressing and embarrassing !
9937,for sure . the 1i960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars .
9938,"wow , that's something ! i woneer what those stats are now . . . football stars probablym ake rx whast top bowlers make ! !"
9939,i wonder as well . greenllis who is a running bakc never fumhled his entire nfl career .
9940,wiht stats like that i hope he was the highest payed running back ! did you realize emmy's could be given to sports channels ?
9941,wow i had no idea . which sports channel received an emmy ?
9942,espn w9n an emmy for xuperimposing th eyellow fitst dopwn line onto the games !
9943,very cool . do you watch espn ?
9944,"i don't , we only have streaming services . do you watch espn ?"
9945,i don't watch it too often . do you like the nfl ?
9946,"i don't have a faorite team , but myh usband likes the cowboys . did you know that women could play in the nfl ? they'd have to meet the league'x eligibility requirements . . . but they could do it !"
9947,i bet they coul ddo it too . i could see them being a kicker or something lik4 6hat .
9948,"geah , maybe ! i wonder wnat the lweague requirements are ; what i tbink wbout every time i watch an nfl game is that there is an average of only 11 minutes of actula ygameplay . i just think about all taht time that they'de doing otuer stuff . . ."
9949,"i haven'th eard of the league requirements . i can'tb elieve it's only 11 minutes of actual gameplay . well , it was really good chatting with you . take car4 !"
9950,hi ! are you a football fan ?
9951,"i am , what about you ?"
9952,"yws , ui am . what do you kno wabout lamar jsackson of the ravejs ?"
9953,"i don't know much , even though baltimore is not too far ."
9954,"well , jackson is a former heisman trophy winnign qb from louisville , who the ravens traded upt o take in the first round of the draft ."
9955,"interesting , did he set any records while in school ?"
9956,"he sure did . only player in fbs history to rush fora t least 1500 yds and pass for at least 3500 yds in a season , and he did that twice !"
9957,ijnteres6ing . did you know that espn won an dmmy for that yellowf irst down marker ?
9958,"yeah , , where would we bew ithout it ! it is almost as importqant to footbhall these days as the huddle , that ohsofamiliar circling up of players arouhd the qb to hide signal calling ."
9959,did you know tyat in 60s bowlers made more than football stars ?
9960,where djd bowlerw go wrong ? apparently the popularity od footgall has exceeded bowoing . i wonder if some other game will pas by footbll as the most popular soon ? perhape gaming ? some pretty high profile college football players have considered not going pro in lieu of starting a career in gaming !
9961,"i think it just got old . if 9 were a college player and could go pro , i would yo pro . yoiu are oinly young once ."
9962,"yeah , but football makes you grow old more quickly rhan other games . . . if you are on the losing end of a lopsided loss , likke the historic 2220 tarring georhia tech gavec umberland , you can grow old quickly ? . ."
9963,"that' strue , even htough thede s only 11 minutes of game play . pretty crazy , huh ?"
9964,you can beak your nec ka thousan dtiems over within that tine . and the nfl will have the event recorded via tracking chips in your equipment so that they can tell how quickly the train that hit you was going . . .
9965,"i thik they also put chip in the f9orball a well , but i'm not entirely sure what for . jay ideas ?"
9966,"to jmonitor speed , rotation , velocity , and locatio n. heck , they even monitor the location of cheerleaders in new orleans , wherd they forbid them from dning in the saem restaurant as any player . i wonder where they put the ch8ps . . . 8n the po mpoms ?"
9967,interesting . i think a lot of teams have that rule . did you know that therwe is now ritten rule against female players ?
9968,"yeah , but there are minimum eligibility requirements thar still need to be met , ehic eluminate most men . . . so , i wonder what percentage of the women quqlify ?"
9969,i think al they have to do is be good enoyugh to paly to b3 honest .
9970,"yheah , but good en0ough to play in the hational football league is still a pretty high bar . i hope a lady does break hatg lass ceiling some day ,a nd i also hope she ekeps all of ner teeth !"
9971,that it is . nice chatting with you .
9972,"hey thee , do you follow the nfl ?"
9973,"i try to , wish the sue rbowl would have been bettert his year , was just boring to me ."
9974,yeah well eh nyoj think about it the game only lasts 11 minutes
9975,that is so unbelievable to me . apparently the nfl has had only one left banded quarterback . do you know who it is ?
9976,is thgat patriots greenellis ?
9977,no that's forme rpatriot rb benjarvus he never fumb;ed the ball in his career .
9978,oh ok . was it kellan moore ?
9979,"yeah that's him , hard to believe that the nfl never produced another lefty l"
9980,yesh exactly there are o many players in ther e. did you know nfl is usign chips o the player's paddign ?
9981,for what ? 6hey are taking technolog to far .
9982,i think they recod hits and theirr unning to maybe work on better helmets and stuff
9983,just another way to spend money . sid you know that i nthe 60's top bowelr made more than top nfl players .
9984,tbat is razy . good thing they make more now to make a devent living
9985,speaking of football the iowa state universities visiting locker rooms are painted pink .
9986,i wonder ift here is a reason for that . did you know espn wom ane mmy ?
9987,"espn , yeah didn't it hqave something to do wiht first downs ?"
9988,i think it was because the creation od the viryual superim;pposed yellow line
9989,o hyeah that's rihgt made things easier if you were watching from home . 2200 was the highest scoring game in college football .
9990,what a win and a loss for 5the other team too
9991,"no that was the finals core , i believe it was in 1916 . do youk now the teams ?"
9992,what a diference . nicec hattingw ith you
9993,the raiders are having skme terrible luck .
9994,"yeah ! do you agree that kahlil mack is the raiders' best player ? id you watch football , that is ."
9995,"yes i agree , i hope he stays healthy ."
9996,what happened to him ?
9997,he jurt his ankle bacvk in november after the raiders traded him to the bsars . i think they should of paoid him what he was asking for .
9998,"oh yeah that's right ! i think so too , his playing styel an dspeed makes his 100 million paychcmk justified ."
9999,"yes , i do not see the raiders gettint better any tim3 soon ."
10000,"y4eah , true that ! i har no idea that tracking chips were used by hte nfl and embedded in shoulder padst o record every move on the field !"
10001,"thats very interesting , i kne wthey wore microphones but 8 did mot know about that . did you know th4 abrrage nlf game only has 11 minutes of live play ?"
10002,that's it ? ! then why are these games taking up my ntire afternoon and evenigns !
10003,"commercials i would imagine , it is a business ."
10004,"oh , yeah ! there's only ne lefthanded quarterback in the nfl ! i wonder it def3nsive plays accommodate that fact ."
10005,i am sure they have special plays for him . woman are allowed to play if they were to make it physically !
10006,oh wow ! has any woman ever played in the fnl ?
10007,i do not believe so bu6 i do not new orleans saints che3rleaders can not dine at the same restaurant as players !
10008,do you know why that is ?
10009,i do not i would imagine theyd o not want them interactng on a personal level .
10010,i can't recall any cheerleaders who have ended up dating a football player on the same team .t he giant flags at footballs tadiums weigh over 1000 pounds !
10011,"taht is heavy , i would imagone datinvg the cheerleadsers hppens a lot . it is probwbly juet frowned upon ."
10012,the atmosphere is susceptible to that since htey travel together and are in the same enviroment a lot .
10013,"yes , great chwtting wiyth you i must eun ."
10014,great chatting with you !
10015,have a good day .
10016,"hi , what do you think about this nhl rule ?"
10017,do you mean the nfl rule ?
10018,"yes of course , i think that the committee of this organizatiohn is aiker at very powerful peiple"
10019,"they do haves a lot of influence , i agree ."
10020,if in reality they control the rules of hte games and other people we can only observe and express their opinion
10021,it doesn't sound like that big of a rule change to me
10022,"socce has hard punches , it is not a physical game nor is it for the weak of theh eart . i think this statement is very true"
10023,i don't think hard punches are allowesd in soccer
10024,"of course tghey do it , for you i have practiced it and it is veryr ude , you uhave played them ever"
10025,"well it should be calleda s a foul in soccer . if a ref saw y9u doing a hard punch to an opponen t, you wouldb e sent loff ."
10026,"yes , 6hee are faults that the referee doe snot see clearly"
10027,i think that some people who watch nfl don't wanbt too many changes .
10028,"if so , others will hcange if they want innovation . wha tdo you think of the university of iowa thazt give uniforms to visiting teaxm ?"
10029,"i did not know about5 that , why do they do it ?"
10030,"i meant to say tha they painted the uniforms of the pink opponents , that was in the deade of the 60s"
10031,i don't think that is sportsmanlike !
10032,"if i tuink it goes against the morale of athletes , thank god those times will change"
10033,yes it would be humiliating . i don't thin kanyone would stand fo rit today .
10034,"sure . you think kf paul hubbard , a field marsal who wws dearf"
10035,that is impressive . mayb ehezrd too many guns going off ?
10036,i do not think that for that reason i suffer from that condition . bu what is important is that in the nfl allow to play this type of people
10037,i don't think it is a problem of a player is deaf .
10038,thanks for sharing your commnts with me
10039,thank you also !
10040,are you interesteda bout football and the nfl ?
10041,ye si am ! are you ?
10042,"i'm not too big a tna , bu6t i have decent knowledgw around it ."
10043,"same i'm not too big of a fan , yet i'm highly interested . such as , how is it okay to have the name redskins ? that's terribly racist . i thought we were ' advancing as a species ! '"
10044,"well of the 32 teams , its onl7y 1 team that has a racis tname . although that still isbn't okay , i believe they will change it if asked to ."
10045,"i sure hope so ! so , i heard that the only left handed quarterabck in the nfl is kellab moore . i wonder why there's so few left handed people in nlf ."
10046,"well , there are also no women in the nfl , even though they don't havr a rule against it ."
10047,"really ? that's extremely intriguinb ! i do know that the new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden to eat in a restaurant as any nfl player . if they are apready eating and any nfl player comes in , the cheerleaders have to get up and leave !"
10048,"there are lots kf interesting facts that go on behind the scenes , like the fact they use trackinfg chips on players and the footballs ."
10049,"oh yeah ! to track velocity , rotation , speed , egc . that's pretty smart of them !"
10050,"they also trackedt h players movements and stuff , maybe htat's where they get all tjes tats from ."
10051,oh yeah . i'm terrible at math so i think it's a good thing they have something like thaf in place . i'd imagine it would be impossible to trak otherwise !
10052,"another weidd fact is fhat in 1960 , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
10053,"knteresting ! i canb imagine that's not the case , these days ! fomrer patriot's running back benjarvus greenellis has neverf umbled the football in his entire nfl career !"
10054,i wonder how ? that sounds good when compared to the fact that peoole think alex smith can't carr the redskins .
10055,yeah it'se quite a record to hold for benjarvus ! i just found out there is a such thing as gaelic football . how neat !
10056,"there sre a loot of different kinds of footabll . rugby , soccer , australian football are some of them ."
10057,"yeah , it gets a litle bit confusing , considering i calls iccer , soccer ! the highest score ever in a footnall game was in 1916 , when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 !"
10058,"that's very interesting , sounds like cumberkand suffered a huge loss . anywayas , it was nice talking to you !"
10059,yeh ! huge loss ! it was very nice talking to you as well ! have a nice day and goodbye !
10060,goodbye !
10061,hi there how are you ? do you like the nationzl football league ?
10062,"hi ! i am not a huge fan , especially situ the ways some of the teams treat their cheerleaders . like hge sawints , the cheerleaders are not permitted to eat at hte same restaurant ae the players , and have to get up and leave if a player comes in ."
10063,"i don't like that rule . it seems very out6darted and stupid perzonally , i think that the cueerleaders should sue"
10064,"they probably have some sort of w3eird nda . i'm waiting for a woman to be drafted , maybe then things will change ."
10065,yes i think we'll see tuat in our lifetime . i think that a woman would make a good kicker o rsomething lioe that
10066,"i do too , especially since so many girls play soccer . it's so weird to thin kthat other countries call socce r'football ' ."
10067,"i agrfee with you . kind of crazy , the averag enflg ame only has about 11 minutes of gqmeplay that seems really low to me"
10068,"that does seem low . football is weird though , ji still cannot beoieve espn won an emmy for crating those superimposed yellow lines ."
10069,no but that s a great invention ! also crazy that the nl develop those tracking ships that they shoulder pds . have you heard about those ?
10070,"i have , some of the high schools are starting to use those . i 6hink it's funny that the u of iowa's visiting locker room is painted pink . my son would vet dressed in the hall ."
10071,i think thst would actually make em play better personally . did you know balc in the 9160s that football stars made about half waht the top bowlers mad
10072,"that is insaen . kinda like that highschool coach who refused to put yom brady in , even though theyh adn't won a game all season , odr made a touhcdown ."
10073,i bet that coaches kicking himself right now . i like th epatriots . i also like the oen running back was never fumble the football in his entire career
10074,"i bet be is too . i'm thankful for the coach who ewouldn't let baker mayfield quit , to become a pro gamer . that's crazy too ."
10075,haha yeah he made the right decision . i was also really god at halo 3 haha . i would have liked to play him
10076,"i'm okay on hat , i'm a fallout fan . i thoughta ll nfvl players were millioanires . it's weird that an engineer earns mir etahn 6hey do ."
10077,oh i like fallout a lot too . that is craz witht he pay as well . do you know how the football huddle was started ?
10078,wasn't it due to a player being deaf ?
10079,yes he was deaf . he us ethe huddle to cover up his ahnd sign so that the othert eam couldn't ses it
10080,that was smart of hi m .i finally saw colin kaepernick's nikea d . itw as interesting .
10081,i have not seejn that . i wish i could have seen the uighest scoring football gam eever . i guess that it qas 222 to 0 haha
10082,"hello , do you like football ?"
10083,not really . i watch it because my kids do . i was not impfessed that espn won an emmy for those supsrimpoded lines .
10084,"oh really , i know my family loves football anjd goes to the games . i didn'tr ealize thee is only 11 minhtss of live game play . but it makes sense ."
10085,i think its hilarious that the top bowlers in the 60's made more than footbqll playerw .
10086,"i know , right ! thinking the visutin gteams don't like the pink locker rooms at the university of iowa ."
10087,"that is just dumb , lol . is it true that the highest score ever was 2220 ? makes you wonder why the cozches didn't stop the game ."
10088,i was thinking teh same . why sit there that long never getting ahead . but that was1 916 .
10089,was that georgia tech ?
10090,"yeah , they need to change that rule that the cheerleaders zhve to leavs the restaurant if a fnl player comes in ."
10091,"i afree .b aker mayfield al,m9st didn't become a brown's player . he wzanted to become a competitive player ."
10092,"really , they must f4el there's too much togetherness in the szme restauran t. lol"
10093,"i think i5' archawic and insulting . especiallg since thwy have to get up and leave , even if they haven't finished their meal ."
10094,omg ! yes . . . . at least have a plan bvefre you go tto the restaurant to prevent it .
10095,alex smith entered college as a junior . rhat's awesome he was able to take so many ap tests in high school .
10096,"agree , he's smart too ! didn't know a eaf quarterback created the circular huddle . htose hand signals ."
10097,"that is interesting . what do you think of the tracking chips in the blls ? seriously , those should have been used on ' deflate gae ' ."
10098,you're right ! and the shoulder pads . great for tracking . i thought there was more than just one left handed quarterback .
10099,"i wouldn't know . i only follo wbaker mayfield , as i too am good at halo 3"
10100,"lol , really ! yeah , ujnderstand thagt ! have a nic enight ! good chat ! !"
10101,"thanks , you too"
10102,enjoy playing halo ! !
10103,"hey there , do you like then fl ?"
10104,"hey , i like and pay some attention . how abou tyou ? do you watch nfl ?"
10105,yeah from time to time mainly superbowl . i mean it is only 1 1minutes of actual game
10106,it's very surprising about 11 mijutes . have you ever been on stadium ?
10107,no i just watch it from the tv . ho about you ?
10108,"i also just atch . did you know that the nlf has no any wrirtten restrictions against female player s, but they have to meet spme requirements . i'm wondering what kind of req7irements it cluld b"
10109,i tihink as long as they can paws the test lijke mael players do they can play . i am not sure though
10110,ia lso know fhat nfl player makes less thbat ane ngineer if we chekc lifelonh time . it's something i also didn't know .
10111,yeah you think they get paid a lot ut they do not rea.ly
10112,"it's just surprising , becdause there lot of money in this industry . really relaly a lot"
10113,yea h. did you know about that rule of cheerleaders for the saints nopt being able to eat in the same restaurant as the players ?
10114,"it sounds relly weird . what if they alrsady here with fr9iends , family , etc ? just stupid rule . it doesn't make sense for me ."
10115,me eithr so strange . did you know university of iowa locker room os pink ?
10116,"no , i didn't know . i didn't know that theh ighest score in history ov football was 2220 , but long tiem agp . did you know that ?"
10117,no that must have bedn a really terrible loss . who was playing ?
10118,"georgia tech againstc umber,and . georgia won"
10119,wow good for them what a win . do you have a favorite player position in the nfl ?
10120,not really . i guess every position has some interesting aspwects . bt i know a lot of people like quarterback
10121,yeah that is for sure . do you knoq alex smith ?
10122,"yes , i know something , but not a lot . do you know something interezting about him ?"
10123,he graduated in two years from college . it was nice chatting with you
10124,hello ! are you gdetting as excited for the nfl playoffs as i am ?
10125,"i aj , who are you a fan of ?"
10126,"i know that a lot of people don't like them , but probably the new engalnd patriots . speaking of the pats , tom brady wwasn't even put in a qb on his jv team in hs that lost all of their games !"
10127,"that is kinda crazy ,a lex smith entered college as a junior and got his bachelors in 2 years , made his college qb career short ."
10128,"tha is pretty amazign . i think hes till had some eligibility , but to think o fgraduating in two years ! or y6ouc ould be like baeor mayfield who almost became a fulltime gamer !"
10129,makes you yhink some people are just good at everyhing . did you know that there was once a deaf quarternack ?
10130,"there was a deaf defensive ,ineman at nebraska , but didn't know about a quartebrack . how did h ecommunicate3 with his teammates ?"
10131,"he used hand signals ,t hat is where the huddle ofiginated , to prev3nt others from seeingf his signals ."
10132,"that 8s really interesting . as the leader of the team , i bet that really helped gdet everyone i sync !"
10133,"rigth ! interesting fact , there has onmly been one lwft handed qb in the nfl , kwlaln moore . i wonder wuy that is ."
10134,"i think he is the only one right now . i am pretty sure theres were others , but maybe tere just aren't a lot of great ones coming out of colkege ?"
10135,"that woul make more sense . soeaking of college football , here in iowa we have the visiting teams locker room oainted pink ."
10136,i am actuakly in nebraskas o i knew about our rivals' pink locker rooj . it's amazing what teams will duet og et an edge .
10137,"isn't it . hey you mentioned likimg the patriots , i can't believe that greenlelis has ndger fumbled the ball in his entire career , that i eamazing ."
10138,it's pretty much unheard of . to think if it was the 1960s these players would be making elss than top biwlers .
10139,bowlers make nothing compared to nfl llayers . but their careers are usually so short and they certainly make the teams monet .
10140,"they really invesy in 6hese players , but you ae correct . the average earning sof an enbgi8neer ove rhis life is mote than an ntfl player ."
10141,really weird to think of it that way . i think antonio brown may have shortened his career a lot after this weekend .
10142,"he's an elite player5 , but obviously has some real issues with tomlin nad the steelers ."
10143,"you know your football . i hope that he finds a home where he is comfortbale . steeler sare out now anyhow , guess i'll watch hockey ."
10144,hockey is fun too adn i uzsually wish i watched it more . have a good one !
10145,do you pay attention to the nfl playoffs at all ?
10146,yes i do .
10147,"which of tbhe teams were you rooting for this year ? i watched a few of the games , and there aas a lot of potentiaql in a lot of the team sthat makes me want to keep my eye o7t for thm next season"
10148,i thought the rams were a good contender and alo the kasnas city chiefs . i thonk it allb oils dkwn to hwat quarterback has a g0od passed rati8ng .
10149,true ! it definitely would have been interesting had it been the chief against the rasm . the qb is key in those games though
10150,i know what you meba . tske adnrew luck for example . he's theq uarterback for the colts adnh e's the 10th most valuable passer of the year .
10151,i wonder if te fact htat kellan moore is the onlyl efty nfl qb affects how the team has been dsoing the past few yers
10152,"ciuld be , then again perhaps not . there has been a deaf quarterrback back in thed day . he's the whole reason the teams get into huddles ."
10153,i wonder how well that team did overall . he seems like th kind of guy who could adjust wellt o the circumstances around him
10154,yes he does ndt he teawm with him . they figured out that by huddling they could keep oppoments from 5eading his hand signals .
10155,"somw fooball players are smary like that . for instznce , alex smith was working on his master's d4gree by the time he was in the nfl draft because he started college as a juior"
10156,he started college as a junior ? i guess he was really working in high school not just on football but on education too .
10157,"i guess if you take allt he ap classes while in high school , college can be shortened by two years . hem ust have been a good player too to be the first overall pick in 2005"
10158,"spaking of good players , have you heard of bakef mayfiel ? not only is he a freat quafrterback but also a great gamere . he thought about going professional on video game competitions ."
10159,"football probably pays more though , and gaming is a gooc plan b if the nfl route doens't work out"
10160,that's true . football pays good now but in the 1960s bowlers made more than players .
10161,"do professional bowlers still make money nowadays ? it seems that espn ahs changed the popularity of footbal; , especially witht hat first down line fhey invented that amde 9t easier to viewersd to keep track of the game"
10162,i tdefinitely does . i think it adds to the excitement too because you lnow just how far theyh ave to go to get their firstd own .
10163,it was a go0d enough invention to win an emmy . sometimes it's the simple things that make a difference
10164,that'sw true lol ! do you watch any cllege football ? they had hte highest xscorjng game ever .
10165,"i don't , but wadn't it back wyen georgua tech playd cumberland in 1916 ?"
10166,"it was , georgfia tech scored 222 unanswered points !"
10167,i feel bad for the guys on cumberalnd's team . a tsome point they must have given up
10168,good evenign !
10169,"good evening , i can not believe that the bengal line backer has not been uspendrd for the late hit on antonio brown during the pitsburgh's win sunday !"
10170,strange that the super bowl is now over anjd the burfict issue comes out again . he played college bal lout here and was just as volatile as he is now probably will get kicked out of hte league soon .
10171,"yeah , i agree it is too bad that the burfit issue is arising again . it was a litfle childish of him to lie and accuse smith schuster of spitting onj them"
10172,hes a menjace and a iability for the nfl who are trying the move away from the dirty layers and appeal more to mom's wh don't want their kids to play because it's too0 violent
10173,"yeah i agree , it is too bad that it is appealintg more to mom's who do not want their children to play fokotball dje to the violen tnature of the sport that is promoted on soc8al media . it is interestign to note that there has been discussion about how the nfl should possible consider increasing rules about hitting players that are not quartrabcks ."
10174,"yeah , they're stuck in a tight spot and if you make the game safer and less violent , they may lose fans . but if you don't have kids playing football anymore , they wont grow up to be nfl players their talent pool dries up !"
10175,"i agree , 2e need kids to playign football and they nee dgpod role modles to teah them how good sportsmanship ! i would also love to see more females players on the football team because technmicallywomen re a;lowed to play on the team as long as they keet the l4ague's eligibility requirements ."
10176,"interesting point aboutw omen , i didn't thihk about that angle . i know some wom4n have been college kickers and had aspirations o play provessionally"
10177,"yeah , i think it is really too bad that theya re not considering female athletes who are just as capable as mem in the sport . young female youth need more female athletea as their role models that they can aspire to be like ."
10178,"totally agree , i have two daugnters adn love the role models they have in soccer anx baskebtall now . it would blow theirm inds to see a woman on the football field . i thjnk it'sg reat tyhat they have femael refw or officilas in the nfla nd nba"
10179,"i agree , having fmale refs or officials in nfl nad nba is a great start , but i definitely would loce to see more athletes . another interesting fac s that the iowa's locker room for visiting football team sis painted pink ."
10180,what ? thzt's pretty sexist and demeaning regardelss the sport . i would think that will be repainted soon in today'sc limate i don't pike jit !
10181,"really ? i kind of disagree , because i th9nk if is a smart stategy that the6y use in order to give themselves an advantage during the game . therefore , from a game point perspecive 0painting your opposin gteam's locker room pink is a great move !"
10182,interesting point any advantage a home team can get over rtheir opponent . i was thinking it may be antiquated in today's pc climate .
10183,"that is a very good point , it would eally be intereting to see dqta about how the opposing team is impacted . fore xample , maybe they could analyze tbhe tracing chips found on the shoulder ads to record a player's every move on the field ."
10184,ii would think there woul dneed to be a psychological measuremetn of the afect of the pink walls . i've heard about the chips in the padding and i wonde why they don't put chip sin the ball to indicwte if a ball breaks the plain of the endzone or sideline ?
10185,"apparentlyt hey do use the tracking devices inside footballs to track the ball's velocity , rotaton , ball speed and locatijon . i guess they do not advertise that as ,much during official games though ."
10186,"fascinating how techhologicawlly advanced the game is in som3 aspects , but antiquated i nofficiating whers they missed 3 pean;ties on on eplay in that saintsrams ame !"
10187,yeah i can't believe that they missed that even though the technology has become so advanced . you would expect them to track all this data especially when ythere is only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
10188,that stat has always abffled me 11 min of action . so mch downtime and wasted time !
10189,"i agree , that would explain why the superbowl commercials are so popular . it is because most of teh game is just watching advertisement , with onlt1 1 minutes of teal live action ."
10190,super bowl commercials were soso this year . the burger king or andy warhol one was the most memorable one for the wrong reasons !
10191,"i didn ot watch the super bowl commercioals this year , but heard thag they were very boring . a lot of my friends told me its ucked this year an dwas a waste of tim eto watch"
10192,"overall your friends are forrect . i wasnt' a fan of either team and watched it with friends , beers , food , good times terrible gfame !"
10193,"that's disappointing to hear , hopefully next year ot will be a better game !"
10194,maybe but i wouldn't be surprised if it was thde ptriots again . . . winning . . . boring as it mig tbe
10195,"yeah ., theh are a tough team to beat . maybe one plaer will decide to quit like baker mayf8eld did in order to pursue a fulltime competitive career in gaming l that may give eh other teams a chance to make it to the super bowl !"
10196,i had no idea that mayfield wated to quit footballo and be a pro game dwhere would ths browns be without him ! ? ! ? !
10197,"i agree , in fact mayfield even boasts that he can beat anyonea t the game of halo 3 if they played against him in 1 on 1 game"
10198,"that's crazy , even though i have not idea about halo 3 , he's a prett good qb"
10199,"ueah , i agree , he has been a great quarterback since he was at the university of oklahoma ."
10200,"he's great . hey , it's been awesome chattign with you !"
10201,"yeah , he is , i would also ;ove to see more left anded quarterbacks . i fins it fasxinating that kellan ,oore is the only on eon the nfl eho is left haded"
10202,i'm not sure i knoww ho kellan moore plays for ! ? ! ? !
10203,good afternoon . do you like the nfl ?
10204,hi ho0w are you ? i sometimes atch the nfl . you ?
10205,yes i usually watch every sunday although i didn't watch all1 7 regular season gamest his year .
10206,i didnt get a chance to watch this year . i hear dthe game was a bit slow .
10207,yes it was . the super bowl that is . did you know there's only actually 11 minutes of life gmaeplay ?
10208,i heard that . it seems too little for so much money . i guess there is alot of time for commercials .
10209,yes i very much dislike commercials . di dyou knoawt he nfl has mo written rule against femae players ?
10210,i cant imagine a woman playing in a game with such bigg uys . seems dangerous .
10211,yes it seems very dangerous . cheerleading isn't dangerous though . although the new orlens saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restautant as any nfl player .
10212,that rules is outdated and sexist . it must w froml ong ago .
10213,yes it really is . it ndeds to be changed ! the av3erage lifetime earnings of engineer is higher than the avgerage lifetime earnings of an nfl player .
10214,"i would feel more comfortabl eif womewn had careers with less physical ris k, like engineering . less chacne for concussions as well ."
10215,yes absolutely . itr is a tough game . i' mglad they get paid so much but in the past professional bowlers made twice as much !
10216,that was a golden age for bowling . that will never return . i guess i was born late lol
10217,you a big bowler ? i think it's a fu nsport . former nfl running back greneellis never nce fumbled the football ! i weohder if he is goo dat bowling ?
10218,he probably would have trouble letting gop of the ball ! lol
10219,ha ha yes good point . you know that circular huddle ? that was started by a deafq uarterback .
10220,a deaf quarterback ? why would he n4ee az circular huddle ?
10221,good question . so the other team cannot read his hand signals . it was really lovely chatting with you today .
10222,that makes sense . i guess he weould need to do that . i enjoyed chatting too .
10223,have a good oe !
10224,"hi , do you watch football ?"
10225,"yes i do , i follow the nfl closely what about you ?"
10226,"from ti,e to time . did you ewatch the superbowl ?"
10227,"i did watchdd the eupebrol my fvorite tam a splaying , did you watch it ? did anyhing specialf 9or the game ?"
10228,we had a party so that was enjoyable . did you know womenc an play ?
10229,"they can play ? thats new for me , you know players have chips in their shoulders !"
10230,"yeah that is so cool , can collect lts of statistics"
10231,"i agree , it is cool , cool how tech can be implemented to a game , footballsa lso have trackign chips and you can learn all kidns of interesting stats out of them ."
10232,yeah . did you know engineers earn more than footabll players
10233,"j didn t, football players earn a lot of money so thats hard to believe i guess ngineers also make a lot of moe"
10234,yeah they do and i find that really fair actiually
10235,"i think its fair as well afterall engineers study vor a long time , its fair like espn winning an emmy for the yellow line that repres4nts first down on football"
10236,yeag i guesas . do you know the highest score of a football game ?
10237,i dont m whats the highest score in a football game ?
10238,"2220 , that was a crazy win and loss for the other team"
10239,"wow , tha ti sa ridiculous win 2220 ,w hat team was abd enough to loseb y that score ?"
10240,"gsorgia tech beat the cumbelrands , what a win"
10241,"i agree , did cumbelrandr etire from football affer that defeat ? i know i would lol"
10242,"must have , i have no idea really ?"
10243,"i see , we,l did you ever watchedb enjarvus green ellis pla7 ?"
10244,no but i know he never fumbled a football . nice chat
10245,"hey there , do you watch the nfl ?"
10246,"i do . some call it the national football league . i call it the never football lague , since they only actulaly play a few minutes in 3ach game ."
10247,i jnow only 11 minutes of play time ye twe are glued to thet v for so long watcuing those 11 minutes
10248,"over 17 weeks , that means one tesm ionly plays 189 minutes per yea r. and if you are za punter , maybe 3 minutes ?"
10249,something like htat . did you know womenc an actually paly iv they want
10250,like any sane woman would wan that ? you know they televise the players age and weight every week ?
10251,i think it is more about the vioelnce in the sport . i tis a dangerous spory really
10252,yes it iz . they put tracking chips in the helmets so jtat they can tell the sp0ouses the recise velocity of the helmet that caused the concussion .
10253,"yeah the techno,ogy eve nfor sports has come a really long way now"
10254,"yeah , theg monitor the speed of the football ,t he locarion of every layer , and whether cheerleaderts are in the same retaurant as the players . . . a nono if youa re a saint !"
10255,i find thqt really strange anx they even have rto leave midmeal if the players walk in
10256,"i npe they at least get a doggie bag ! bwlers don't have to put up with such rules ! you know , back in the day , bowlera made more money htan nfl players , but that was years ago . . ."
10257,"yeah that is interesting too . speaking of football , espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line"
10258,a virtual line . that means they got an emmy for nothing . the players do all the work and they get recognized for imaginary lins .
10259,i know right ? do yku have a favorite player position in nfl ?
10260,"depends on the team . 32 team sant hey all paly the game a little diferent . on a runningcentric team , 8 admire the tailback and fullback positions , as well as the offensive lnemdn . on a throwing team , the qb is often th emost admired . how qbout you ?"
10261,yeah i am going to go witht he quarterback too . did you know brady was never put i9n the game in high school
10262,"wow . epicf ail for that coach . you kno w, brady's felow teammate , ellisgreen , nevdr fumbled the ball even one during his entire career as a running back with the psatriots ? that is admirable !"
10263,i know that is . do you know alex smith ?
10264,skart dude ! he had earned so many ap credits in hs that the college took him as a junior . now he uses his brain in the huddle as qb in the nfl . . .
10265,good for him talent and brains . nice chatting witrh you
10266,"hello thee , are you an nfl fan ?"
10267,i am ! i loke how ben roethlisberger has the most franchise wins for the brow2ns and he plays for the steelers lol . are you ?
10268,yeah big ben sure ha sdominated the browns his whole career . i am a fa nyeah but mostly of my fav team .
10269,who is your favorite team ? mine is the vikings !
10270,nice ! mine is hte 0ackers so we have had our fair share of good gfam4s .
10271,i agree ! i remember when brad jmohnson played for the vikings . he is teh onlyq uarterback to throw a touchdown pass to himslef !
10272,"yeah i remember that ! i was a big brtt faqvre fan myself , heh ad soime good games for your vikings ."
10273,even better days with the packers haha . i d like watching college too . can you believe 14 of the world's 25 biggest stadiums are for college teams ?
10274,"that is pretty crazy , di dyou know the visitors locker rokm at iowa is pink ?"
10275,yes i've actually been in iyt ! very cool and funny at thes ame t8me . it's no as cool as that high svhool stadium in aloen teas that cost 60 million dollars to build !
10276,holy crap that is ju7st insane ! i don't think other colleges or high schools around the sorld have such big stadiums .
10277,"mkaes you wonder if they could have spwent it elsewhere , o revem if they are good haha . i can't believe matt patricia was a rocket scientist before the nfl !"
10278,"wow that is very interesting , rockdt scientist tof oobtall , what a switch !"
10279,you would think he would get boredc oaching at thgat poit haha . i also cant' believe there is only oen left handed quarterbacj in the nfl .
10280,"that is a crazy fact about the nfl ,d o you know the story behind the incention of the huddle ?"
10281,wasn't it formed because of a deaf quarterabck ? i forget hiw name though !
10282,"paul d . hiubbard , yeah good call ! i thunk that is probably the coolest fact abouy football ."
10283,i wonder if tehy ran around to each player to give them the play abck then haha . do you know how they stretch the flag acriss the field everyg aem ?
10284,"yeah thats a good question lol . i'm not sure , do you know ?"
10285,with a lot of people haha . it weights 1100 pounds and ost 500900 to make !
10286,"holy crap ! well it's been fun and interestint talkjing with you , i hope you have a good day ."
10287,"hi , o you watch football ?"
10288,"yes i do , what about you ? do you lik eit ? follow it ?"
10289,sometimes . did you know wmen can play ?
10290,i didn't but i g7ess i'm not suprised gbecause it makes sense that people migh tbe concerne dfor a woman'ss afety in football . it's amazng how much we spend on stadiums
10291,thag is true . do you know how much game play htere is in a game ?
10292,"i dont know , maybe 40 minutes i guess 5 minutes arent really gameplay but ads ."
10293,"yeah htat isf or sure , lots of downtime there"
10294,"yeah , there is a lot of wastrd time in games , its unbbelievable how much the flags at football stadiums weight !"
10295,for sure . do you know abot that rule for new orleans ceherleaders ?
10296,"no , what rule do tey have concerning cheerleaders ?"
10297,they are not allowed to eat 9n the same resetaurant as the players
10298,"that is really unfair , that ruld should be eliminated and the team should receive a fien for even having a rule like that , it ,akes me so angry !"
10299,me roo it is wo sexist . teg worst is they have to leave mid keal too
10300,"i agree , so do you know whok ellan moore is ?"
10301,is that the only quarterback that is lpeft handed ?
10302,"he is , the only left handed of the league , brad johson is another curious character , how did he mawnage to give himself a touchdown pass lol"
10303,"i ould eally like to see that , how he did i"
10304,"i wonder if the video is available at youtub , another interesting fact ia tfhat pnly two african american quarterbacks have actually won the superbowl"
10305,yeah that is durious for sure . there ares o many players of co.lor
10306,"yeha dough williams and rrussel wilson apparently both of them played agaisnt the brocmnos , theres another interesting fact about rusell , want to know more about him ?"
10307,sure what else do you know ?
10308,"ok so he is sti,l under a mlb contract even tho7gh h ehas not played in regular season since 2011 and even got traded in 2018"
10309,do you like football ?
10310,"hey there , yes i do i like kellan moore espeically"
10311,i hear he is the only lef handed qb in the nfl .
10312,"yup thats true , i think it gve him an advan5tage , do you know the history ogf the circularh uddle ?"
10313,"no , what is i t?"
10314,"it was a deaf quarterback , he'd use it to cover up his signing from teh opposite tesk"
10315,"interestign , so they had to hide the hand signals ?"
10316,"yup exactly , did you hear that baker mayfield was almost a professinoal gamer instead of a quarterbac k?"
10317,"no , i wonder how muchh ew ould have made ? itc an pay fairly well ."
10318,"ya i agree , did you know how popular bowling was in the 60' ?"
10319,it was so popular that bowlers made more than footbal lplaye4s .
10320,"yup twice as much , do you like the parikts ? they have w player who has never fmbled"
10321,"i'm not a fan , i don't hate them , but they aren't my team ."
10322,whatd o you think about the highest scoring football game of all time ? thes core was 2220 thats crawzy
10323,"i can't believe it , given that the average gak4 only has 1q minutes of gameplay ."
10324,"thats truse , that seems so low though , kind kf like the lifetime earnings of an nfl player compared to an engineer"
10325,"i'm not surprised , engineers can make a lota nd abd football palers makev ery little ."
10326,"rhat is true , what do you think of the strange eules with the saints cheerleaders and players ?"
10327,"i think thatr ule , while strange is pretty common , they hjave it for my hom eteam too ."
10328,oh
10329,well nice chatting with you !
10330,"well , hello there ! how's it go9ng ? ready to chat ? do you like that there football ?"
10331,"hi there , yes i do like football . did you know women can play in nfl too ?"
10332,i've heard as much . but will the day ever come ?
10333,"i am not sure actually , we will have to se e. i mean all they have t0 do is play for 11 minutes"
10334,11m inutes of action . years of training . maybe women could be kickers or something . maybe men could bec heer;eaders too .
10335,yeah why not . did you know engineersa ctually earn more over the lifetime than football players ?
10336,"engineers are in demand 12 womns hould become engineers , not football players ! fwer concussions ."
10337,yeah and better pay it seem s. i guess it make ssense sicne the career of a footblal player is shorte rtoo
10338,the career is short and dangerous . hard to be an engineer when your brain is broke . what do you think of u of iow'as litlte trick ;
10339,hm cirious about i t. i know pink cfan be distracting so i wonder if thatw as the reason
10340,"pink was meang to calm them down , tunr thej in pacifists ! it didn't work as far as i cqn see . they didn't win no emmy for a pink locker room ."
10341,true . what do you think about esp nwinning an emmy though for the superimposed yellow line ?
10342,"that is teh highlight of espn's career . tey will never excded that achievement . in fact , tv will never get better than that . a yellow line ! imagine !"
10343,i know . i fin dit kind of strange but as well l good for them . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
10344,is he a football player or something ?
10345,yeah he played for the patriots and is the only guy to have never fumbled the ball in his career
10346,i hopet hat he got a bonus for such outstanding plzy ! must have breen tough . wverybody probably tried to get him to tumble .
10347,"yeah , that is true . did you know bowlers used to maek more thqn football players ?"
10348,"bowlers have the dwal athletic build , that's why . vbeer and pizzas nad big shiny oms . that's all you needed back i nteh 1960s ."
10349,i guess that explains it . do you know what the highes5 score in football history is ?
10350,"no i don't , what is it ?"
10351,"it was pretty high for sure , 2220 , that is insane . nice chat"
10352,do you like football ?
10353,"9 have never been fond of sports in general . are you referring to gridiron foot ball , like we have in"
10354,"yes , i am . i'm not such a fan of football either . football has gsinex so much popularity in the last few decades . in the 60s , topbowlers amde twice ss much as the top football stars ."
10355,"a current nfl player makes less in a lifetiem than an engineer , buta n nfl player probably work salot less years ."
10356,that's true . the fooytball playerts have to learn tom anage their money well for the res tof their lives . i assume that's difficult for kany .
10357,"that is probabty true for most sports , the negineer jmakes more than am lb in their liftimes ."
10358,following everything that goes on on the field in football is hard for me when i watch . somtimez i wonder how scoring can be objective . it's interesting to know that players and footballs have tracking chips .
10359,havingt he yellow line for the first down makes it easier to watch .
10360,"yes , you're right about that . it's interesting that esp won an emmy forc reating that !"
10361,the technology makes it more fum and easier to follo . iw onder wat they use the teh xhips in foot balls and shoulderpads to do .
10362,"the shoulder pad chips record the players every move and the footvalls have tracking fot velocity , basll speed , rotation and location . technology is neat !"
10363,they spend lots of effort to tyrack stuff in tue 11 minute ot so of live game paly .
10364,"right , i6 is crszy how little game play there actually is . msybe that's part o fthe reason id o not like football ."
10365,"the quarterback touches hte football for most offensive plays , but that doesn't mean hte other players hav emuch contact with the ball in th e11 minutes ."
10366,there is a lot of pressure on bgeingv a quarterback . i guess taht's why they are paid more .
10367,"it was a deaf quarterback whno invented the circular huddle , so hte other team couldnt read his sigmals ."
10368,that's interesting to know and cool that tbhey cotinue to use this method .
10369,"most quarterbacks are right handed , htere is only on eleftie currently in the nfl ."
10370,interestign . 8i wonder why that 9s . do you think that pep talksd nhelp lead into victory ? swearinger of the redskins certainly does . his teammates say he is a fire starter and a maniac but it seems to help them win .
10371,usuaal calling a person ' crazy ' and a ' fire starter ' are not compliments but his teammate used those phrases as a compliment .
10372,right . it's fun to see how passionate some nfl plyers are about their game .
10373,are you a foo5ball fan ?
10374,some waht but i don't get to watch it znymore like i uee to .
10375,i hear that . out of the 32 tesams do you have a fwvorite ? i'm a steelers fan .
10376,i eas grseen bawy when i watched . the ave 16 weeks of game play and each team gets a week off .
10377,nice . i like how green bay is owndd by the community . the nfl has no written rule against female players . maybe one day we'll see one on the filed . maybe as a kicker ?
10378,that's possible although im surprised we haen't already . personally i htink they should have their own league liek the wnba .
10379,they did at one time . i used to watch it a few years ago but it seemed like it was more for ehow . they wore shoulder pads but at the same time they were wearing shorts to show off their legs . can't remember the league name . did y0u know that there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay in an average nfl game ?
10380,i did knowt hat and it is hard to bnelieve . the tracking chips are also in the footballs as well as teh shoulder pads .
10381,seems lie tjhey are getting way too deep analyzig the game . did you know that espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line ?
10382,"i did and tha6 line brought me great joy , lol . the s7per bowl is usually played the first week of february ."
10383,yes ? i look forward to the super bowl every year . do you know what the hoghest scoring football game ever was ?
10384,i do no t. was it a college kr pro game ?
10385,it was a college game in 1916 . georgia tech beat cubmelramd 2229 . talk about a blowout .
10386,"wow , i would have not wanted to be on that bs ride home and sure it was the longest ride eve . you know that the iowa universities visting locker room is painted pin k?"
10387,lol yes . they musth ave did that to try to mess with the opponants . how about patriots rb bnejarvus greenellis ? ye has never fumbled the ball once during his career q
10388,now htat is an achievement ! do you know if he is in the hall of fam for that ?
10389,i don't know . curious to find out though . there is only one left handed qb in the nfla nd taht is kellan moore . i'm not familiar with him .
10390,me either . did you know at one p0nt bowlers made twice as muh as top nfl players ?
10391,i didn't . i wonder what the pay difference is now ? did you know that the circular hudlde was created by paul hubbard who was deaf so the other team could not read his hand signals ?
10392,oh ok that makes snese . it was in the 60's taht top bowler made twicse as much . i doubt that they make ay where as mucjh as them now .
10393,"i bet threy are nowhere close . lol baker mayfijedl almost quit football to pursue a full time career in competitive video game playing , that would have been crazy . it was nice cahtting with you ."
10394,hello do you watch footbawll ? ?
10395,hey there i watch football from time to time . i watch the super bowl for instance . what about you . what d you like to watch ?
10396,"i9 dont reqlly follow football , but iw atcht he 49ers sometimes ."
10397,"yeah i'm in michigan so i mostly watched the lions , although they suck hhaa . i do like tom brady though . apparently ther eare different variations of football . did you know that ?"
10398,different variations ? what do you mean ?
10399,"there are other variations of football such as australian rules , rugby football , or gaelic football . i dont' know how those wprfkb ut they awre different versions for dure"
10400,oooh i see . i tnought u meant in american football
10401,haha nope . i must have misspoke maybe haha . do you like snoop dogg ? he made a fight song fir his son's football team
10402,"i used to like some of his muzic , that is pretty cool if him to do that ."
10403,yeaj it is . would you go to a football stadium tha tcost 60 million to build ? even iv it was or a high school ?
10404,yeah probably just to see what it looked lik e. football generates so much moneyt .
10405,yep it does . it's also crazy that 14 of the 25 largest stadiums in the world are all america nfootball team stadiums
10406,"taht is impressive . although , foktball is not popular all 9ver the world so i guess that makes sense ."
10407,no you're right . do you know the department of defense ? thet op three most hibh walary employees are all football coaches someho
10408,football coaches are part of the department of defense ? since when ?
10409,yeah i onow right . taht's definitely a lof of taxpayer money . what about quarterbacks . do you like sny of them ?
10410,id ont khowm any current quarterbacks except tom brady and eli manning .
10411,yep i like to mbrady a lot . i also know there's a quarterback named ekllen moore an dhes lefthanded . the only leffganded player in the lsgue
10412,wow thats pretty weird stat . i cant believe there sonly one left handed qb in the ahole nfl .
10413,"i know right . i wonder if it givee jim an advanage or not .a lso weird stat , only two black quarterbacksh sve ever won teh super bowl . i wonder why that isw hat do you thok"
10414,its been good chatting .
10415,hello are you a fan of the nfl ?
10416,not really . football seems overly complicated to me asnd it doesn't seem like theres' even taht much 0laying going on in a typical game
10417,no . that's bscaeue there's only 11 minutes of actual gameplay during a game . who do you think makes more over their careers . . an enginer or an agerage nfl or mlb player ?
10418,"if i had to guess , i'd say an engiener . they provide valuable services to our society and sports players are trained athletes but their jobs are really to entertain us"
10419,you're right ! they make more over a lifetime . did you know that the nfl has no written rule prefenting female players from playing ? i wonder if we'll see one any time soon ?
10420,"really ? i always assumed they did , like mlb . that's why women can only play softanll ."
10421,"i'm thinking that maybe we'll see one get in there as a kicker . di dyou knowt hat they put tracking chips in the footballst o record data like velocity , rotation , etc ?"
10422,"i didn't know gthat , but it makes sense after ' deflategate . ' i dobn't think we'll see a woman playing anytime soon , th9ugh ."
10423,maybe they would like to play at the university of iowa wheret hey visiting locker 5oom is painted pink . wonder wh theyd id that ?
10424,"mayb eto sike them out . although maybe that backfiref if it's hot pin o,t hat's a very stimulatingc olor , and pale pink is very relaxibg . should have painted it oange which is offputting"
10425,tre . i was thinking maybe for breast cance rawareness . in teh 1960's top bowlers amde ywice as much as the top football stars of that era .
10426,"i gues speople had better attention asans the nand wanted to watch a slowermofinb sport . pseople back in the day weren't too smart , though . a high school rootbsallt eam had a terrible season and never even thought to use4 their second string players and one of those was the tom brady ."
10427,wow . i didn't now that . speaking of something terrible . . . . cumberland must have felt like that after georgia tech ebat them 2220 in 1916 .
10428,"i think that's called a shutout , right ? hopefully they've recovered i nthe 100 plus years sincet hen lol"
10429,lol benjarvus reenellis must have been pretty good . the former patriots running back never fjmlbed the ball once during his career . that seesm impressive .
10430,even more impressive : espn wonj an emmy just for superimposing a yellow line on their broadcast . must'b ebeent he early days of speciual wffects
10431,yes . amazig how far tv graphics have comd . qb baker maufield almost quit football to pyrsue competitive gaming full tike . that wouldn't have been a smart move .
10432,comoetitiv egaming ? like video games ?
10433,yes . isn't that crazy ?
10434,"it is . i mean , he wojld've sustained less brain damage had he gone that route . long term issues from had injuries inn fl players is a huge issue"
10435,yes . they seem like they are taking steps to address it . i have to ge running . loved chatting with you ! have a great day !
10436,"hello , do you like football ?"
10437,yea but i don't know ifc aelx smith is a better qb than kirk cousins likec oach gruden said
10438,"hmmm i'm jot sure , i dont know kirk cousins ."
10439,"he was traded to the minnewota vikings , cous8ns didn't really have a good season"
10440,oh i see . i hear aelx smith took so many ap tests in high shcool he entered a university as a jounior .
10441,"yea alex smith is really smart , before he was dtafted he started w aster'zs degree"
10442,tgts ikmpressive .
10443,"tom brady is a pretty dsmart qb too , it's a shame h enever got to start for his jv high schoolt eam"
10444,"yeah their loss , they might ahve won that season lol"
10445,"or at lewst score a touchdow n, hopefully jinipero serra high fird that vlach"
10446,"apparently , there is only one left handed qb in the3 nfl"
10447,"yea ,k ellan moore , i actually saw him on one of the football show on espn not too long ago"
10448,oh nice ! does he still play ?
10449,"i rea;lly din't know if kellan moore still plays , i think he's just espn's only left handed foobtall analyst"
10450,thats cool . did you kno win the 60's top bowlers made almost twice as much as tfootball players ?
10451,"nope , i knew in the 60s football players weren't pwid much but i didn't know nowlers made more"
10452,"kinda crazy , consixering football player spretty much risk their health every game ."
10453,"yea and azn nf game only averages 11 minute of live yameplay , boxer sgo longer than that"
10454,"yeah 11 min over a span of 3 hours , thats really long ."
10455,"yea , i woner if they will ever have females player in the nfl since there are no rules against it"
10456,"that would be something . i guess if she is qualified i say lert ger play . its been great cahtting , i learned a lot ."
10457,do you like american football ?
10458,"oh yeah , i am a huge fan ! i am a packers fan so aaron rogers is my quarterback ."
10459,"nice . quarterbackss eem to tened to have a higher iq tha na lot of other positions , which makes sense since they are in a leadership role for the offensive team ."
10460,"yeah , that is a good point . they have to learn all of the plays for the entire tea m. the qb is the one guy wh0 know severything gpoing on or at least is suppoxse to know it all ."
10461,totally . they're responsible for calling the whole play in the huddle .
10462,"yes , they have a lot of pressure . ya know the nfl doesn't have a rule against female players ."
10463,"yeah , i love that . though it's a pretty sexist industry , given the rule the saints have with the cheerleaders ."
10464,"yeah , they can not eb tpogether or sene together . for instance if the players are somewhere that the cheerleaders are at then the cheerleaders must leave the location ."
10465,"that's offensive . it sounds lkke aomen are better off becoming engineers , as they make more money over a lifetim ethan a professional footnall player ."
10466,"wow , yeah the money part of tue game is wild . i know that alex smith is one of the great qb's who s really smart and makrs a lot of money ."
10467,"does he ? i would think since he got all the way to his master's degree before entering the draft , he would've lost out on somem oney . ya know , if he had just entered after high school ."
10468,"yeah , that is a really good point . i agree with you . he was the overall 2005 draft ;ick . baker kayfield was th4 overall ick from ou last year . we ,ove the college ou team , too ."
10469,can you believe mayfield once cohsidered quiting altogether to pursue a gaming carewer ?
10470,what ? that is crazy . i can't egen imagine what his parents would have said to him . i guess college kids a;; like gamingh .
10471,"rihgt ? yeah , eh says he can beat anyone at his college i nhalo 3 . not sure how you can make much of a career with that !"
10472,"yea , i agree with that statement 1q lol . the university of iowa painted its visitors locker room pink , another type oc game , i guess ."
10473,"just another exampl eof the sexism in collegiate an dprofessional football , i guess . can you believe bowlers in th e1906s made twice as much mone6 as top football stars did ?"
10474,htat is as hame for sure . not fair at all . salary was not fair for the toll it took on the players bodies . i dont' think bowling was too hard ont he bowlers in comparison .
10475,i'm not sure . it would be an interesting study . i know tennie players habve a lot of wear and tear i nrheir bodies from the repetitive motion . . . i wonder what happerned to bowlers bkodies over the courss of 1520 years swinging a 19 pound bowl backandforth .
10476,"hmmm , gooc point . the nfl has put chips into the gear in order to yrack things like impact and force of the hits taken . so progrsss is being made ."
10477,"yea , technology is crazy ."
10478,"hi , how are you ?"
10479,"pretty good , how are ypou ?"
10480,i am well . do you enjoy football ?
10481,i do was a little cisappointed with the superbolw though .
10482,relaly ? why ? who were your ooting for ?
10483,well i was rooting for the rams but i would have liked to have seen a better game .
10484,that makes sense . who is your favorite team ?
10485,well if i had to pick between the redskins or bucks i would probably go with the sins . you ?
10486,"i am from chicago so i love the b3ars . do you watch footba,ll a lot ?"
10487,i never get the chance to as i am alway6s busy . i hea dtaht the only left handed quarterback is kellan moore .
10488,"that is true , although i find it hard to believe .s o if not s;orts , what do you do in your sparet ime ?"
10489,don't really have any at the moment . did you know that tehr eis af ormer patriot that ha never fumbled the ball .
10490,that's crazy . ofr that the univbersity if iow'as visitor's locker room is painted pink .
10491,i guess that's a psychological thing . every bit helps i guess .
10492,"ga tech beat cubmerland 2220 . i wonder if they have a pink ,ocke rroom ?"
10493,wow that gam ewas bake in 1916 right ? espn won an award for the sulerimposed yellow line representing the first down .
10494,seems lije a low bar to win an emmy . nfl games only have 11m inut3es of action .
10495,now that was hard to believ . almost as hard as the fact that bowler in rhe 60's made more than nfl players ?
10496,yeah . or that the nfl uses hcips to track playef movement .
10497,i think that's taing it way to far . kind of liek new oleans cheerleaders having tol eave a restaurant if a player comes in .
10498,nicec hatting with you !
10499,is it true kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl ?
10500,"i think so ! i alwayx get him mixed up with kellylahne c9nway when i hear the name , though . do you think nfl is wayche overt here at ths white house ?"
10501,kellanne conway haha that's funny .
10502,oh eje z! probably ! i guess the cowboys are one happy nfl team now after the amari cooper trade . nave you hyeard about it ?
10503,i haven ot heard of that 've been netflix binging lately . i had no idea a;ex mith was such an educated guy .
10504,"well , it's not really big news . i guess the cowboys are happy because the r5edsins were leadimg but hen they overtook them . i wonder if it was an epic foobtall game ?"
10505,it would ge nice to see the xowboy swin a championship again . i like the history behinbd the huddle being to ehlp ad eaf quarterback .
10506,"yes , i remember learning about how hte huddle started in school ! verys mart ! iw as reading thatt ne cowboys have so much confidence lately in th nfl that they think their d4fense is unstoppable ."
10507,those are some big words thinking they are unstoppable .l can you ever imagine a game score reaching anywhere near 2220 likw the georgia tech v cumberland ?
10508,i can't imagine ! the losing team must have been very embarrassed . i don't think i've ever see nan nlf or any other sportd game ata ll with a score eve4n close to that . have you ?
10509,no tha twould be ridiculus . everyone in management would have to be replaced .
10510,"i think one of the most famous nfl quarterabcks is to mbrady ? i rejember something about a footblal fwmily comprised of a dad andt wo sons that's super famous , too . i think it's th emannings ."
10511,oh yes htem anning another great football name . those guys were awesome . i thknk one of the bro6hers still plays .
10512,"i remember now , one of the brotherws is eli short for elisha manning . unique name . i think quit ea few football players have unique names sufh as ajke butt of the broncos ."
10513,yeah at lo3ast those were their given names and not something lke chad ocho finco because of his number .
10514,that's true ! i think amari cooper ha had many injuries in h9s nfl career . i'm surprised the cowboys are so happy about that wide receiver ; the risk of re injury seems high in football games .
10515,yeah the sport has sped up a log and comimg back from an injury always put syou at a gigher risk of it happening again .
10516,i think cooper came from the raiders to teh cowboys ?
10517,yes i think thats how it worked out . so is there really chips inside players shoulder pads ?
10518,"i tuink so ! the nfl even has those chips in the actual footballs . i wish i could have htought of that idea ! who knows how advanced footblal with be in a few decades , rigth ?"
10519,no joke . can you imagine if helmets wqere stillj ust made of leather . collissions could become lethal .
10520,"that would be terribly dangerous ! i think i'v eheard the nfl doing education courses as to how to still make contact but avoid injury . strategic , almost like mwrtial arts . hope they teach young football players , too !"
10521,"hello , how are you today , do you have time to cdhat for a bit ?"
10522,did your nfol team start 02 this year ?
10523,unfortunatly it has
10524,they have less than a 5 perceng chacne of making it to ths playoffs then
10525,well it's good that i'm not a huge fan ofn fl
10526,you must be wathcing the uninspiring broncos oakland game right now ?
10527,yes but just on in tbe background with the tv muted
10528,the seattle ofvfense have reqlly been provng themselves the past couple wekes . don't you think ?
10529,"somewhat , they're doing somethings well and slacking on more of the basivcs ."
10530,j . j watt has a rewal chance at winning defensive player of the year again this year
10531,i agree and fthe bill's performance lately shows it .
10532,if you asreb 8sy watching the raoders and broncos game i can let you go
10533,yeah if you don't mind i can't keep my eye off th eraiders strong defensea jd sacks
10534,russepl wislon was sacked five timez in yesterdwys game
10535,i was watching and it was glorious
10536,seattle has tbe 2nd best offense in the league this year
10537,there runvlocking is horrible though sk i don't see them having muvh of a chancfe this year
10538,deshaun watson js ahving another mvp like year
10539,it appears his ankle is finally getting bette i just hople it can hold up through teh season
10540,he has help from jj watt if all else fails
10541,"true , i just wish the runb;ocking was on par with hte rest"
10542,ny has a worse defens ethan buffalo or arizona
10543,"hello there , do you know who tommy mcdonald was ?"
10544,he was a terrific football player who helped my team the eagel sto the nfl hampiosnhip in '60 .
10545,"yeah tha tis ribht , good call ! wel lyou certainly had a wild season last year !"
10546,"close on this year too ! i wish mcdonadl would have been around to help , but he unfortunately died at the age of 84 . he was a hall of famer ."
10547,yeah i was sad to hear about him passin . i was glad he made i into the hall though .
10548,he started out as a twotiem all american in oklahoma and pl6yed 12 seasons for the nfl making th epro bowl 6 times . he was quite a player for his small figure at 5 foot 7 inches .
10549,"yeah that i sso cool , i love it when those tiny guys make it big . i was a big fan of muggsy bouges and earl boykins in the nba . are you a big footbal lfan ing enefal ?"
10550,"not particularly , but i like the supsr bowls . if women started playing , that would be rfun to watch . the nfl has n rule against it . i aould cheer them on ."
10551,yeah i think that is so cool and i definitely hope to see a women playing in the nfl sometime soon !
10552,i do like bowling though . are you a bowler ? in the 06's they made twot imes more than fotball 0players .
10553,"yeah 9 like to bow land really ! ? that is so crazy to thinm abvout , i would like to sew a gaph that shows how they overlapped as time when by ."
10554,"perhaps if br benjarvusg reenellis were around ten , the footabll players may have made more money with his impreesive no fumbels in his nfl career ."
10555,"wow , i didn't know that , super impressive . i wonder how many toyal carries he had dhring his career ."
10556,i'm not sure but with only 11 minutws of live gameplay in the average game it still is impressive .
10557,"yeag i think i have read that before , you mean like not counting all the breaks right ? that seems like so little !"
10558,the balls znd players are constantly tracked though . all this techhology adds to teh game an extra tactic not used back in tommy mcdonalds time . i bet no tracking chips were used then .
10559,yeah i don't think they had that kind of technology then . i know they use tracker sin helmets for safety inte.igecne .
10560,"do you l9isten to games on hte radio ? if you do , you can also hear jupiter's radio storms on the am stations ."
10561,"i do when i have to , i r3elaly like the local radio station we have here , they play lots of oldies . wow , that is a crazy fact ! jupiger is so far away !"
10562,sur3 is nd it xounds like soldiers who also were probably far away from home made radios out of just a razorblade and pencil diode . that was very inventive .
10563,"that is an awesome fact , never kneq htat one as well . it wa snice chattin gwith you , i hope you have a good night ."
10564,"hello , co you like football ?"
10565,"hello there l i do liek football , did you watch the super bow lrecetnly ?"
10566,i did actuzally . what i did not know was that there were onl 11 minutes of game play
10567,yeah thats about the average actual gameplay during a regular game . there are lots of stops and reviews and all .
10568,yeah ahd all the ads . did you know women can play ?
10569,yeah i think that would be so cool if a female plaher made a pro roster in the near future .
10570,"yeah ih ope that we see thqt at some point in the future , would make the game more fun"
10571,"it would , and it would give young girls something to jmotivate them to achieve lal srts of goals ."
10572,that is very true . did you hear about that rule that applies to enw orleans cheerleaders ?
10573,"yeah i read about that , it seems a bit silly and outda5ed if you ask me ."
10574,i think it is really messed up an dnot sure how it is still around
10575,"yeah i ahree , did you know about the avesrage lifetime earjnings ?"
10576,"yeah they make less then engineers , but then again their career is shorter"
10577,"that is what i figure 8r is , that the average career of a pro sports player is so much zhorter ."
10578,yeah . did you know njw they are hsing chips to track the playerx in the field ?
10579,"yeah i read about that , i think ig helps them develop better safey features as well ."
10580,"yes that makes sense . how ab0ut hte radi8o , xo you listen to jt ?"
10581,"yeah i do , i found a good loca station that i really like . how abut yourself ?"
10582,"yes me too . if you listen on the am , you mihgt catch jupiter's storms"
10583,yeha isn't that so cool ! verhy interesting .
10584,"yeah for sur e. nice chatting with you : ,"
10585,did you know thay jupiter's storms are so stronbg that you cna ick them up okn your am radio !
10586,"hello there , no that is so cool though ! are you a big fan of astronomy ?"
10587,"i know a little bit about it , what aobut you ?"
10588,"yeah i like it quite a bit . i'm a fan f the radio as well , i really enjoy my local stations ."
10589,ya did you know that you can make a radio out of a lencil and razorblade ? i guess they did that in wwii
10590,"that is such ac ool fact . another interesting thing about the radio is that in canada , 40 percent of the music ;alyed over the radio has to be canadian ."
10591,"that is interesting , i don't know howg opd that sounds thoufgh , only a few canadian bands that i know and i can't say i like htem that much haha"
10592,yeah thats what i thought oo . i bet a lot of people don't think thats a very good la wlol .
10593,"haha but it does sound better than ths finnish radio statont hat does a weekly news program completely in latin , that souds worse haha"
10594,holy cow that sounds awful . did you know there is a website where you can listen to old radio dramas for free ?
10595,"no i didn't know that , i would check that out i bet there's some gems on htere , are you watching the superbowl later ?"
10596,yeah i think that is so cool . yewah i'm going to be watching who do you think wilk win ?
10597,"well i hope the patriots win personally ,l what is shocking is that thea vefage gam4e only has about 11 min of live gaeplay haha"
10598,i think they will win as well . and that is so crazy to think about . i do know you notice it much more when attending liveg ames .
10599,"ya i haven't been to a live game in years , and i didn't know that women could technically play ford the nfl which would be interesting"
10600,i think that would be so cool if we did get a female player in the league . i think that would be awesome for young girls aroun dthe world that are interested i nsports .
10601,"ya i think it wiuld adsd a new dimension , i hpe the game later doesn't have a bowout scor like the hikghest scorw in anu football game ever , 2220 haha"
10602,"holy crap , i think i read about tnat before , wasn't it a college game ? they would have to dcore a touchdown on every play basically lol ."
10603,"haha ya when trhe score got to be 1000 i think i wuld just leave , cumberland must have felt horrible after that loss haha"
10604,"yah l, i wonde rwhat thwe halftime talk bny the coach was lol ."
10605,"haha ya like , all right guys we have no chance just go to sleepn owh aha"
10606,"hi ,d o you watch football ?"
10607,i watched parts o fthe last superbowl . i have a passing knowledge and passkngh interest in football so i am on and iff
10608,nice . did you know university of iowa ha soainted the visitgor locker room pink
10609,do you know why ?
10610,i have no idea m maybe discourage them in some way
10611,"indeed , perhap sit iks a mental thing to catch thme off guard . so are you familiar with th enfl ?"
10612,yeah with some of it . i know football players used to make less than bowlers back in the day
10613,i couldn't believe that the serabge nfl game is only 121 minutes
10614,i know yet we are glue to thw tv for hours on end
10615,i admit a lot and i mean a lot of ation goes on in those few minutes . i mean the nfl is even putting chips in the bgall and shoulder pads to get better data
10616,"yeah that must come in handy . espn won an award , an emmy"
10617,i admit their yellow line which they got an emmy for dewfinitelym ade the game much more digestible for the audience
10618,seems that way . do yo8 know whatt he highest score in history is ?
10619,i'n no tsaure but it must have been a tleast a difderence of 150
10620,"it was 2220 , georgia tech beat the cumberlands"
10621,"i wonder if georgiq tech was just that good , cumberlands was 5hat bad , or perhaps a but of both"
10622,i think it was a combination of botu
10623,that doess opund most plausible . georgia tech must have had talents like tomb ray or green ellis
10624,not sure who played in their team but must have been boring to watch too
10625,"frue . perhaps surpisinjg until 50 pts , entertaining until 100 pts , and dull until 222 points"
10626,yeah i guess . nice chat
10627,vood evening . are you a football fan ? did you knowt here isa ctually a new league starting tonigh t?
10628,"no , i did not know that . i don't watch a lot ov football , but i do know some intereesting bits of trivia about it . honestly , playing the game was more mky brofher's gig . he got a football sfholarship in college . did you know foe instance , the highedst score ever in a football game was 2220 ? can you imagine bene beat that badly ? yikes !"
10629,"i cda't even imagine a score ljke that ! if you , or your brother , are curious , it's cal;led the alliance of american football and it's actually connected to te nfl now ."
10630,"id id hear they were also trying to revivet he xfl , that's the footba.l leaguer un by the wwe wrtestling organization . never cajght it the first time around , so i can't say if bringing it back is a good iea or bnot . . ."
10631,i think that is scheduled for 2020 so the spring will be interesting . did you happen to catch the euper bowl ? it seems ike it's one of the rare singleelimination finales in our us sports .
10632,"no i didn't see it , heard it wasn't the greatest though . they even griped about the group performing at half time , maroon 5 , although i understand they had a hard time even gettting ajyone to perform . wonder if thec ommercials were any good this year though . . ."
10633,"it was a defensive struggle ,m aroon 5 was really iust adam levine showinbg off , and the commercials were rather bland . it's crazy to think that in terms of actual gameplay , teh halftiem dhpw was longer as an average nfl game j7st uas about 11 inutes of lijve action ."
10634,"11 minutes ? it's hard to believe there's so litlt eactuqal action in a game ! wonder if any of tye teams played any trickw o neach ohter , like how unversity of iowa has tyheir visiting team's locker room painted pink ! hehe . . ."
10635,being from nebfaska i know all about iowa's ploy to gain any psychologica ladvantage !
10636,"yeah , it's kind of interesting . . . they've done studies and found color's reallyd o effect people psychologically . read about an experiment where they painfed a weight reoom pink and they fond the liftersa coulnd't lift as much as they normally could . crazy , huh ?"
10637,yep ! another craqzy thing to me is that bowlers used to make more than football players !
10638,"oh yeah , that was back when bowling was a huge thing theyd' even have crlebrity bowling tv shows and stuff . seerms grossly undair though , givenh ow injury prone football playersa re ."
10639,"absolutely . especially when you factor in tqahgt d4spite allp fotball players seem to make , an engvineer makes more over a lofetoime ."
10640,"neat ligtle facto . . there'd actually no rule against women being football plawyers in the nfrl . if they met the league's eligibility requirements ,t hey could sign right up . not sure if that'll happen though . . ."
10641,"t does seem like a stretch due to the physical diffeences . it is interesting that apparently a woman can play for hte nlf , but a saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if a saints player comes in ."
10642,"oh , wow , guess they'ere serkous about the two not fraternizing ."
10643,they must hbe ! i wonder which group it protects ? they definitely invest in 6eir players . did you know they have made chips to track about every movemnent on the field a player makes ?'
10644,"yeah , i heard about that . . . they've got a chip in ghe ball as well . . . probably makes it easier to go statistics and wharnot . especially sicnse it can keept rafk of velocity , rotation and speec ."
10645,amazing how far it's come . i bet there was a time just getting a radio broadcast of the game was huge !
10646,i remember back when all thdy had was maddsen using the white4 ' chalk ' lines and now they've got all these cool graphics and stuff to help everyone keep track of what's going on . . . it's p4etty amazing .
10647,thanks for the chat ! it's rtime for some football !
10648,"hey , you too ! have a great evening !"
10649,you too !
10650,hello how are you doing today ?
10651,i am good . just missing football season . i can't wait for the 32 teams to get back out ohn the field in the fall !
10652,i love football too . wo i syour team ?
10653,i a mfrom florida so i root for the dolphins even though they are terrible ! the dolphins lpse most of their 16 games a season . how about you ?
10654,ahh ai'm from ohio so i root for the cincinnati bengals .
10655,hard to b4elieve nfl football has been played since 1932 . the field was 80 yards back then .
10656,that's cray . there's no written ru.e sgainst female players in the nfl .
10657,"i would like to sees ome female playrs ., i bet they would be very strategc ."
10658,it would be interesting . an average nfl game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
10659,have you ever seen snoop dogg's son play ? he' pretty good ! snoop wrkte a song for th3 high school team his son was on .
10660,"i heard he's really good , but have never seen him play ."
10661,i enjoy listening to games on the radio . the use of air waves and electromagnetic energy wavea is a great way to dosnume football .
10662,i love listening game son the radio as well . the averae lifwtime earnings of an engineer is higher than an averwge nfl and mb player .
10663,engineers are the creators of the trackin cyips the nfl uses to measure player moves on the field .
10664,that's a cool technology . ayb eit can help out with cocussions and other injuriez through xata .
10665,tha twould be amazign ! a bdilliang engineer htat now coach4s in the nfl is named matt patricia .
10666,that's cool . the highest eve rfootball score was 2220 .
10667,humiliating score for the losing team ! they probably did not make it to the super bowl o nthe first sunday in february .
10668,former patriots gereenellis has never f8kbled the football in his nfl career
10669,"that is impresxive ! he deserves a nice stadium, like the allen , texas one taht cost 60 million ?"
10670,it wa sgreat talking to you !
10671,"hi , how are you doing tonigth ?"
10672,great . are you in one of the 32 nfl cities ?
10673,"at the moment , no . but i grew up nears oe . how about you ?"
10674,"i am in phoenix , one of the 16 nfc cities . unfortunately , we have the number one draft choice which means the worst record ."
10675,"well , its' a rebuilding year . happens tok many teasm . who do you think you'll get ?"
10676,i would hope kyler murray but the defensive guy from ohio state is most likely . the season is 17 weeks even thoughe ach team only playd 16 games .
10677,does anyone care about th esexual preferences of the players in the nfl these days ?
10678,"i have heard a little rumbling , but i thought it was about gendsr rather than homosexuality . what have you heard ?"
10679,haven't heard . i know that there is no rule against women . what's the story ?
10680,i thinmk that some teams just worry abou tpr challenges . i ttakes a team chemistry to win . i expect to asee a woman kicker someday . no rule agains6t women in the nfl .
10681,"yeah , aw oman kicker makes sense . could come over from soccer ."
10682,"great point . imagine the income that players get from only 11 minutes of action in each game . if you play defense or offense , that is 5 . 5 minutes for you ."
10683,that's a pretty good perminute sapary . it's quite different from basketball and soccer .
10684,"true . i started my career as an negineee andm ade about 4 million so far . my neighbor was a runnig back for the cardinals and he mad 7 million in his last season . but on average , engineers make more ghan nfl players over a career ."
10685,maybe your neihgbor could become an engineerl ater in life after he retires from football . the earnigs of an engineer are good . women should go itno that instead of football .
10686,"there is a push for woemn in stem . he coaches running backs for another nfl tyeam now , so he is doing okay . brand new porche in his driveway this week . in new orleans , the cheerldadrs cannot dinbe in the same restaurant as a player . the cheerleader has tol eave if a player comes in ."
10687,"i think that's an outdated sexist system . parents , don't let your daughters grow up to be cheerleaders ! teach 'em engienering !"
10688,"tyose nfl salaries took a while to grow . in the 1960's , top bowlers earned more than nfl playe5rs ."
10689,"tip bowlers were ucky that the professional leagues didn't have their act togethwr .c ollege ball was big , and tv hand't grown enough ."
10690,"you are right . also , hte nfl has to pay a lot more players than the 10 or 12 top bolwers . that espn yellow line that marks the line to gain for a first down has been a nice improvement for tv watchwrs ."
10691,"it has been an improvement , but does it deserve an aware ?"
10692,nice chat !
10693,"i did not know that jupiter had rwdio systems . nos , i know that earth is not the4 only planet with razdis ."
10694,i didn't know that jupiterh ad radio system either . do you think that life on jupiter ?
10695,"well , i am imsgining it right no w, but on jupiter it woul be dark cuz the sun is so far away ."
10696,es k that's what5 i learn i wonderf or years dif man actuall visit these planets . if the did amn may had place items on these planets .
10697,"well , maybe nasa had a certai ntechnique and ststemt o briung astronaurts to space ."
10698,yss i pretty sure they do . have you ever heard of sun's music ? i have any irea what is sun'?s music .
10699,i bet that is a lot of money for nasa to use in making machines and satellits over there . no i ahve not .
10700,"that's true , i wonder why dc resident called tbe nflp eagles the america's tam ."
10701,that i sinteresting . i don't rscall . i think they woh th esuper bowl last year against the patriots .
10702,whag did you thinko about sunday's super bowl games ? do you think the entire game was exciting ?
10703,"i think it was excited when they werd tied3 3 . once i saw 4th quarter , i already knew it was a win for the atriots . i like the halftime sho0w ."
10704,"ges , il ike the haltime show and commercials . i agree i knew who will win also rams is a rather young team ."
10705,i am so happy that adam levien ha some special guests . rmas can wi nanother year . they should feel lucky to actually be in the super bowl .
10706,"yes they shoul,d , but they came from such a long ways to lose against a team that already won five super bowlc hmapionships ."
10707,this gives hte mmor etiem to practice and develop strengyh and ability . it's never too late . when was the last time they won a super bowl game ?
10708,"i am not sure the exact year , but i think the ra,s lost aso . they play several games against new england and lost ."
10709,"wow , againstt he patriots . once the rams know the patriots are against them , they eihter know that they will lose or they wil lhave a chance to win ."
10710,"true , what team is your favorit eteam , or you don't have a favorite team ? pittsburgh is my favorite team ."
10711,i thibnk i mentioned earlier that the 49ers are my favorite team .
10712,"no , according to my knowledge this is the first time that question by me . i like them ."
10713,"all rigbt , i will go now ."
10714,ehy ! do you like foktball at all . . . .
10715,love it and sad it is over for the year . i tseems like the season goes so fast . you know the sewson is only 17 weeks wirh one bye week . not enough football for me .
10716,4ight ! i love foktball but rarely get to follow it . i sometimes lisyen to the games on the radio lol . . . always busy . . . .
10717,did you know that jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can b picked up and heard by an am radio . i wonder what that sounds like !
10718,"really ? i really need to try and tune in so i can hear that , an a . m raio station huh ? i will check it out ! there is a website that plays old classic radio dramas for free ."
10719,i love som etalk radio so that channlr may be fun to listen to ! ij canada the music on their radios havet o be at least 40 percen tmust be canadian .
10720,"wow , i bet so the canadins can get good radio air time . i get that . i was listening to a talk radio show and they were saying an nfl game on average only has a mere 11 minutes of actual live play . . . . that's crazy !"
10721,i know . . . you think that football players get azid the big bucks but i heard in he long run you are vetter off being an engineer . they tend to ahve higher than average lifetime earning sof both a nfl and mlb player !
10722,"no way ! i never would have thougt that at all . ? . . very interesting . i like the fact that the nfl has no written rules against women playingf ootball , as lon gas they meet their requirements ."
10723,better than being a cheerlezader . . . the new orlenas saints che3rleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurnt as any nfl player and they even have to leave if one omes in yo eat . talk about doube standards !
10724,"that i sjust wron g, i wonder if that isa true to this day or something of the past . . . . just like the locker roomb eing painted all pink in the university of iowa's locker room for the visitibg team lol"
10725,that is sure to annoy the visitijg team ! did you knos that in the 60s top boqlers made more money than footblal stars . crazy ! doesn't so9und right !
10726,"that is truly cdrazy ! i bet that is not the case in present times lol . i wonder if they still use the tracking chips put into players pads to record their every move . . . . and insid efootballs to track velocity and rotation , speed very interesing !"
10727,thank goodness no oje is tracking how slow ua m 12 you know the game footbalk mneans different dports to different people . lik esoccer in some countries is called football in others . so confusing !
10728,"haha , met oo ! that is itneresting and makes sense ! i wonder if they tracked rhe game that was won 2220 back in 1916 . . . . that isx awesome , what a score !"
10729,wow ! i feel sorry for hte team that lost . wasn't it cumberland ?
10730,"yes ! i was actually . they played against georgia tech . pretty amazin g, just like ow former patriots rb neved fumbled a ball ever , in his nfl careed !"
10731,patriots are an amazing team . . . love or hate them theyh ave thbe talent . did you watch the super bolw this year ? it is usally held the first sunday of february .
10732,"i didn't get to see the shperbowl this year , bt i heard it waas an awesome game ? the patriots are deginitely a great team . sould havel oved to ahve sene the game !"
10733,me too ! well maybe next year with thne eason starts in september you can make it to a gam e.

10739,iw onder if thaf is supposed to have some effect on the players
10740,i wonder too . bowlers make more money than them though in the 60s
10741,i guess football was not that popular back in th eday either though
10742,true ? do you know what the highest scor ein college football is ?
10743,yes that isg eorgia tech beating cumberlamnd 2220
10744,yeah and that was way back in 1916 nad is still a record

10746,yes that was for the suerimposed yellow line
10747,yeah . did you know banjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball ?

10759,i do sometimes . how aboutg you ?
10760,"actulaly , i don't . only for big games like the super bowl etc . dijd you know the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ? ?"
10761,i know ism't that crazya s long as a game lasts . did you know in the 6t0's bowler made twice as much as the top foorball playrs .
10762,now that is pretty awesome . i like bowling . hink it take sss much skill as football . i didn' trealize girls could play in the nfl if they met the eligibility requirements .
10763,i think guys would give them a hard time but it's coo . and i fthey are on he university of iowav isiting tseam they get a pink lockr room
10764,"that would be great . cant' say i like teh rules about the mo saints' xheer.eaders . apparently they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any bnfl player already in the restaurant . plus if a playerc ome sin afte4 , hte cheerleaders have to leave . unbelievbale !"
10765,i think that 9s crazy . if they are at away game what are thec hances of them running inro a playera t a restauran t. i wonder if tjey enforce it .
10766,i wonder why it is a rule . somethinyg must have happened o cause them to come up wit that one !
10767,tha is true . and i think it is interesting tahtn fl uses trackinvg chips in their players shoulder pads
10768,"alk in all , i thinkf ootball i spretty scientific with all the playes and strategies they come up wiuth . those chips track all their moves and helps the coaches esign their moves . pretty genius ."
10769,trude . can you believe there was a game lof a score of 2220 . how is that even possilbe .
10770,either ga tech was really good or cumberland was reaply bad . how about patriots' running back benjarvus hwo never fumgled the bnall in his entire career ?
10771,that is a great accomplishment . did you knowe spn won an emmy for the creatio of th esuperimposed yel;low line .
10772,that is pretty cool . i need lal the tv explnaations that go on durijg th4 gajes . otherwise i would be so lost sometimes . espn is the channel we watch for all sports .
10773,i like espn for some things . i gog espn 2 for ufc events adn it has not been a good experience .
10774,"that's too bad . did you hear that the cardinals'a drian peterson is buying his linemen mattresss because they did s we lin the last gaem . i guess they were pretty horrible ebfore . he watns to make sure 5they sleep well . : ,"
10775,that is nice of him to do . nfl player make a lot of money but it's interesting tha tenginee5rs mak3e more money than fnl players
10776,"they use a lot of bhrain power ! btw , im eant to sau the redskins no tcardinals . : ,"
10777,do you like to listen to the radio ?

10791,"i dont . i am concenred that the sport can cause a lot of problems . the concussions could be a problem for hs players . i like the gme , bu5t player safety is key ."
10792,"well said , and because of fan's valid concerns , game is changing .b ut my dad , who coached hs football for 41 yrs . , used to say is biggest concern was boysw ho would not report injuries to him . . . less of an issue today , do you think ?"
10793,i dont know . the problem is that injuries are expected but kids want to play . i did not play fotball because of my concern about injuries . i figured 9other sport swere safer .
10794,you figured right . do you suposes occer is safer ? surr is popualr worldwide . . .
10795,"soccer is safer , but the guys are wimps . they frake fouls . the women are3 tougher ."
10796,"i see . college football is huge in my regio n. did you know that 14 of the world's 25 biggest stsdiums are college stadiums liek our beaver stadium , penn state , ."
10797,"i figure that the stadiums have ec9me places of worship . i enjoy sports ,b ut they shoul dnot ovcershadow the mission of the university . anyway , great chat 2"

10813,"yes , people really can seem xsimple sometimes . but i bet the line swre funny ."
10814,they most have been . i bet a lot of kids lisrened to it . i can pictur all te kids gathering around a radio every sunday for the new show .
10815,"yeah , there probably was not much else to do for entertainment . watch the grass grow ?"
10816,they could paly with there ball hooked to a paddle . lol .
10817,"yeah , that silly old game . or hoolahoops ! y4ah !"
10818,so are you a football fan ?
10819,i sometimes waftch . i guess the super bowo is good . i didnt watcy it this year . you ?
10820,i didn twatch it eityer . did you know that snoop dog wrote the fight song to his sons o0tball team .
10821,"snoop ! probably keep it g rqated . anyway , great chat !"
10822,lol . have a great day .
10823,"hi , cdo you watch football ?"
10824,"not very much . i did watch my saints in the playoffs ; the final playoff game was painful . but , i do have season tickets to lsu footblal !"
10825,nice . did you know women can play too ?
10826,"i fgured as much , considering we had a wo,an ref in the nfl playoffs . i just don't know when they wilkl brezk thru thatg lass ceiling . what i find interdsting is the use of fech in football , like tracking chips to record hit ' g ' forces ."
10827,yea that is nice . and they ca ntrack so many more stat9stics with those chi8ps
10828,"football , and othe rsports , have odd traditionx and superstitions . did you know sain'ts cheerleaders cannot be in the same restaurant with any nfl player ?"
10829,i findt hat very sexisy . the worst is that they have to leave even midmeal
10830,"i agree . it seems like what is of ffield should remain off field . it caries over toc ollege football as well . the university of iowa painted the visiting football team slocker pink . i don ot knoe if it was i nhumor , intimidation , or a bit of both ?"
10831,i think pink iw a color that causes distraction so maybe it was to help their own team
10832,"probably a carryover ib machoism . but , you can say technology has really chagned the game . we have tracking chips in the uniforms and th eball and 2way radio in th qbs helkmet . it sure has changed a lot from the days of hand signals between the qb and the coach on the sideline !"
10833,fo4r sure . did you now bowlers used to make more than footbalpl llayers back in the day ?
10834,"i did not know that . we often here about the mega contracts the sar players get but not th econtracts of the average and 2nd string players . i recently learned that because of the short career in pro football , the average lifetime earnings of a typical nfl player is less than the lifestims eanings and an engineer . unfortunately , too many football players don't invest wel, for their after football days ."
10835,i guwess not . i mean they still get paid more nowadayzs but a lot of them take on secondary jobs to make ends meet
10836,true . there are just nbot that many positions in sports tv and radio for retired nfl players . esp nhas a good suite of nfl r4t9res and has made tech work for them . did you know espn won an emmy for ty3 superimposed yellow lien to show the first down location for theirv iewers ?
10837,ye3ah that is qute the azchievement for them to win an award for that
10838,i grew up in a very rural area where tv reception was poor ; so we listened to theg aes on the am radio . do you still listen to live radio or have you migrated over to internet streaming and podcasts ?
10839,yeah i do from time to tiem . curious to knlw if i can xatch jupiter's storms in there
10840,"tyat would be interedting . i wonde rif astronomersc an predict or time tehm so that we can know when aznd how to tuen it . its interesting at in canada , in an effort to preserve local culture , all radio stations are requi4ed by law t play 40 percent cznhadian music . i hope they have many other performersa nd not justin bieber , lol , !"
10841,haha one would hope because jut justin would be boring . but good for them for supporting canadiaqn talent
10842,"true . we do the sam3e hting down in louisiaja . not by law but in the interest of retainming our cajun , creole , and zydeco musical heritage . with respec tt heritage nad history , did you know that a finnish radio station as a entire weeklt news program in classical latin . i wonder how many listenhsrs fkllow and understand the centuries old dead laguage ?"
10843,i really wonder about that too but if they are still in business that must mean theyh ave plenty of listeners
10844,true . well its aboutt ime to go . the dogs are starting to go off when they want their supper . they zre pretty good at herf football with respect to recovering fumbles . if i couldj usxt get them to stay inbounds !
10845,well have ag ood one . nice chat
10846,do you watch or play football ?
10847,yes i do . my favorit eteam is teh eagles . rid you know that in the 1960's top bowlers made twoce as much as footballs tars ?
10848,relaly ? it's azmazing how much popularity football has gained since then . now we wven have a superimposed yellow lin ethat espn woh an emmy for .
10849,i didn't know about the superimposed yellow line . did you know that the highest score ever in a footblal gmae was 2220 ?
10850,"wow , i wonder what happened ! i'm not really into footbwll as there are only 11 minutes live gameplay on average in a game bu6 that semes pike it wuld have been an interestinvg game to watch ."
10851,yes it doe s. th efnl has no writte4n rule against female players . if ind that interesting .
10852,"i hope a woman will be able tom eet the leigibility require,ents on3 day !"
10853,so do i . do you listne to the radil ?
10854,not that much . did you know that you can hear jupiter's sorms 9n th a mradio ?
10855,no i did not
10856,there is also a finnish radio station that broadcasts a weekly program in classical latin . i wonder how many people can understand it !
10857,"that is very cool . i ncanada , all radios are requirwd to have at least 40 percent of the music to be played to be candia n."
10858,"i haven't hearr that much canadian music , i dind't know there was that much . would you listebn to a website with thousands of classic radio dramas ?"
10859,"i know avrill avigne came from canada aznd her music eas played there . no i would not listen to a website with classic radio dramas . i is free , which is neat ."
10860,i'd love to lwearn how to make a foxhole radio
10861,how do you do that ? i have n3ve rhard of a foxhope dadio . since 1989 a finnish radio station has broadcasted a weekly news progra mcondicted in classical latin .
10862,i am not sure but soldiers in wwii used to make them with a razorblade and pencil .
10863,that is cool . do you know that new orleans saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat in the same resturant as an nfl payer ?
10864,"yeah , and not only that , but i heard that if the cheerleaders are already eating there and the players come in , , that the cheerleaders have to leave ."
10865,i fihd that ridiculous . chderleaders have very low wages to beginw ith which is unfair . thanks fo rchatting with me !
10866,"yeah , i wonder how they can get away with that . nice chatting with you ."
10867,"hello , do you watcht he nfl ?"
10868,hello ! yes big an her ! how baout you ?
10869,i love the nfl as well . did you know they have no written rule against females playing ?
10870,i wsould like to see a girl plzy . eb nice . the unifersity of iowa paintd their visitors lofcker ropms pink . must have eent o mess with the other team .
10871,taht would be cool . i wonder if the pink locker room actually affected the tea mat all ?
10872,i doubt it . lol in the 1960's someone would have b3en better off to be a top bowler rather than a top football star of hte day because bowlers made twice as much money as the footballers sid .
10873,wow that's pretty amazing . i would have nevrr guessed that . i be bowlers on't make a whole lot these days .
10874,"i bet nowhere near as much ast he players . however , the averags lifetime earnings of an engineer are mlre than the earnings of an average football player ."
10875,that's interesting . i guess because nfl careers sare usually oretty short .
10876,thatw ould be nmy gueses . do you know hwat the highest scre ver was for a college football gam e?
10877,i saw it was 2220 . that is just insane !
10878,talk about a blowout ! i was surprisedt o find out tha6 there is actualy only 11 minutes of live gameplay per an average nlf game . i thought it would have been a lit6tle more than that .
10879,i can't believe it's only 21 minutes of gameplay . i would have never guessed that . must be all of the huddles and play calling .
10880,ye sand tv timeouts . lol how about rbb enjarvus greenellis . the former patriots running back neer fumbled the ball obce in his nfl career .
10881,that's pretty amazing to never fumble your entire career .
10882,i know . i wonder how many carries he had ? did you know that espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line you see while watchung games ?
10883,i have no idea . do you listen to teh radio ?
10884,i love listening to the radio ! how abouy you ?
10885,i do too . espscially in my commute into work . did you know jupiter has radio storms so strong they can be heard on earth ?
10886,same here . i actually liste nto a lot of sports talk radio . i didn't knoa that about jupiter . how cool is that ?
10887,iy was good talkin gto you !
10888,"hey there , do you listen to the radio ?"
10889,"actually , no , i don't listn very oft3n anymore . i think i got urned off vby all the advertisements . still , the way it works is fascinatin gin how it's transformed in its original form"
10890,yeah for sure . you can even catch jupiter's sto0rm in the am .
10891,i guess it's a large planst tha tcan still reach ush ere on earth . there are websites now that let you listen to lcassic radio dramas .
10892,that is so nice and it is free . do you know much lati ?
10893,"most consider it a dead language , but apparently in finland , some still onow it enough for there to be a news program in classica laltjin"
10894,i really wonder how many listeners they have considering latin is a dea dlanguage .
10895,"i know a schoo lthat still teaches it , so amybe not as dead as we are told . inc anada , at ;least 40 percent of the music you'll hear is canadian since it's a law there"
10896,that is one way to support local and national artists . in th earlier times soldiers used to mak radios using razorblades and penci;s
10897,"i wonder what kind of information they could p8ick up . the radio deinitely isn't as popular as t used to be . bacok in the day , people would use it to listen to eports eventsl ike that of the mlb and nfl"
10898,"yeah , i would like to mnow that too . do you watch football now on tv ?"
10899,i typically only watch a handful of playoff games and the super bow l. what's cool is how they se embedded chips in the shoulder pads and fo9tballs to track speed and all that . it males sense
10900,"yeah they might be able to use that info fo rso many things . at the 3n dof it , in a game of nfl the game time is only 11 ninutes ."
10901,"which isn't very lon gwhen you thin kabout it . some people make a big deal about how much money they make , but the averag eengineer wil learn more un a lkfetime"
10902,"yeah , i heard a player teaches in the off season to akes ends meet ."
10903,"wow . k guesst he season only lasts 17 weeks of games . apaet from training , they have a lot of time off"
10904,and sometimes they have strange rules . new orleasn cheerleaderzs cannot eat in the same restaurant as the nfl players .
10905,"maybe the wives requested htat one . usually the rules exist due to prior problems . there's no rule against women playing , but i'm not sure if any have tried"
10906,"yeah i wonder abou5 tha t. at least f they wsant , they can try for it"
10907,sounds like a risk of injury . the playoffs in the nfl are much quicker tahn thagt of the mlb since it's sikngle elimination
10908,tnat is true . it was nice fuatting with you .
10909,do you like football ?
10910,i do . snoop dog once wrote a song for his sons' team
10911,nice . u of iow apainted teh visitor locker r9om pink
10912,i wonder if that i ssupposed to have some effect on them
10913,me too . bowlers made more than football players in the 60s
10914,wow . coaches of football are really well paid nowadays though
10915,yeah tru e. do ou know the highest score n collegef ootball ?
10916,"i ahve no idea , have not heard of that"
10917,it is 2220 when cumbelradn lost to georg9ia tech in 1916
10918,wow what a scor3 . a stadium in texzs can sit 18 000 people
10919,"wow that ia huge , how much did that cost ?"
10920,it wads about 60 million and it is for a high school
10921,wow . did you now women can play in the nfl ?
10922,did not know that buft heard they are using tracking chips on the players now
10923,yes if they meet the requirements they can play . they are ?
10924,yes they are tracking vleocity and speed and such
10925,nice i wonder if htey can use that to make th egme safer
10926,good poiht . did you know mqtt patricia used to b ea rokcet scientist ?
10927,wow that is such ah uge career jump
10928,indeed it is . nice chat today
10929,sameh ere
10930,"i wonder i fhte athletes wouldn' tbhavwe already had their own king sizedd mattressess before being gifted tehm , haah ."
10931,can you ever really have too many though ?
10932,then again i guess maybe the coach is wealthy enough to afford fancier mattresses since his team is performing so well .
10933,"his is true . we might find out on the next ' redskins talk ' podcast . good dudes , fdree beer and king size mattresses foer days ."
10934,is that a lodcast operated by players on the team ?
10935,it sure is . it's on siriusxm nfl radio . it's where w ecan hsar about adrian peterson's 96 yards against the cards on sunday .
10936,"oh , taht' sinteresting , i typically like listeningt i radio dramasx myself which is lucky for me because there are websites where you can listen to tons of episodes ofg them ro rfree ."
10937,"you make a good point . i didnt' know until today that bill murray was the voice of the human torch on the fantastic four radio show . aw jeeze , an't radio great ."
10938,"i didn't know that either . rzdio is great , and also so mysterious ! i never realized that plnaets like jupiter have strong rqdio storms happening on them that you can actually listen to through an am radio ."
10939,that'sa ctually pretty c9oll . seriously . i think they should put more nfl games on the radio . itw oule be a good chance to liste nto teh patriots getting crushed on .
10940,the fact that youc an even make your own radio using simple items like razor blades and pencils would also make that a dream situation for a foot5ball fan who is handy with electronics !
10941,that would be pretty great . i would build my own radioj ust to listen to that song that snoop dogg wrote for his son's high school football team
10942,"wow , i never heard about that ! taht sounds like a lot more fun than just having you5 locker room painted pink like the university of iowa had"
10943,"at lwast it'a . . . . okay , okay , pink is prettyb ad , but the high school stadium in allen , texas cost 60 jmil . that wouldf buy a lot of pink paint ."
10944,it's amazign that for hw much they put into th elocker roosm football llayers makd much less than say engineers for example !
10945,"ha ! that's true . but coaches make abnk . the wrmy , navy and air force football coaches are the highest paid people in the department of defense ."
10946,wdll that's good for thbem ! even the people at wespn hwo design g4aphics like the yellow fis tdown line have won emmys so they probably are paid a lot too
10947,"that's a good poing . it's too bad ' redskins talk ' podcast can't win an emmy . ah well , at least they gave one to rick and morty ."
10948,i guess for football players it's the superbolw that feels like their own emmy
10949,this is true . hopefuly it will be the redskin turn at the big game this year .
10950,i guess e'll see after the regular season is don eadn they all play in the playoffs !
10951,do youw atch footabll ?
10952,from time to time . how about you ?
10953,"i used to watch it a lot more , but ap;parently the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of gameoplay ."
10954,"come to think about it , that is so strange , there is so much in between . and the game has advanced so much . now the plaqyers carry chips in their paddings"
10955,"yedah , whe i watch it , it seems like i'm just watching people stand around all day ."
10956,so much down time . there is an astronaut turne dcoach that serves in one ofc the teams
10957,"interesting , i wonder what hes tudied in school ."
10958,rpi . have you heard about the curiosity sorrounding that school ?
10959,no i hsaven't . 2what is that abou ?
10960,"they have fight song that includes a sin , cosine and a tagnent and six digits of pi"
10961,interesting . did you know that jupiter storms can be heard on the radio ?
10962,yeah on the am . maybe i should switch from time to time to esee if i can catch it
10963,"me too , but i'm not sure what station ."
10964,me either . there wa sa song by hanson that became hge most played in a chicage rsdio because the djs would not reveal the band
10965,i woner if he is canadian ?
10966,i am not sure actually . in 1948 bing crosby filled something like more thwn half of the radio time allocated to recordd music
10967,"i like bing crosby , do you listen to him much ?"
10968,notr eally .h ave you heard of bill murray ?
10969,"yeah , he's a great actor . i really like his movies ."
10970,he was the voice of human torch in fantastic four in 1930s in radio
10971,unteresting . i saw him in grounhdog dat .
10972,"the nfl is a professional american football leaguec knsisting of 32 teams , divided equally between the nfc and afc"
10973,"hi , ho ware you ? are you a football fan ? do youf ollo wthjr nfl ? which of the 32 teams do you like ?"
10974,chicago is my favourite team . what about you
10975,"i usually 4oot for the udnerdog in the superbowl . : , did you knosw that there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay in an nfl game ? that's a grea salary on a perminute basis ."
10976,"new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurnat as any nf lplayer , the cheerleader are required to leave ."
10977,i guess that to prevent relationships betwen players and cheerleaders . they must have ad problems in the past .
10978,"the players want to focus ob the game , i thjimnk ist he good rules ."
10979,"true . speaking of women , i eonder when women will play in the nfl . there's no rule against it ."
10980,"now , radio is hea rby onlyf ew peoples . you listen to rzdio ?"
10981,"9 use dto listen to the radio when i was a kid . now i se tne internet , which is much more convenient ."
10982,jupiter has radio stodrms so strong htatt hey can be picked up and heard by an am radio .
10983,i don't know that i would want to listen . probalby not asg ood as top 40 .
10984,do you play football ?
10985,"not really a football player . heard that back in teh 60s , top bowlers made more than pro football palyers . tgings certainly have changed ."
10986,there different variations of football are known as gootball codes .
10987,i don't know the rules for the other forms of footbal l. seems to be a universal sport . i wonder5 if any of those teams painfs their visiting twams' locker rook pink .
10988,its the most lovable sports by many people . its has so much fans .
10989,are you going to watch hte super bowl this weekend ? which of the teams is your favorite ?
10990,"yes , yellow line representing the first down line for american football games ."
10991,espn won an award for that teature in the telvised games ! it makes it easierf or vie3ers to understad the game .
10992,there is a websi6e where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio drmas for free .
10993,i wonded what generation listens to those programs . yungsters don't want to hear those shows .
10994,hearinga nd 5thinking are the most two importnat event in brain . it makes brain activity .
10995,"well , it'x been fun chatting !"
10996,"yes , have a great day ."
10997,bye !
10998,hi how are you ?
10999,"good , how about ou ? arr you a football fan ?"
11000,"if thede iw money in it , i am . i like toi wach the game for gambling . you ?"
11001,"i play fantasy , which is partially gambling , and i bet on the super bowl . who would have bet the highest score for a football game wa sgeorgia tech defeatingc umberland 2220 ?"
11002,"that was a blow out . i figure tghat gt had something to prove to cumberland . i dont know what , but they proved it ."
11003,"lots of fumbles , interception s, et ."
11004,that must have been a lot of fun for thge teams . hood experience . a learning experience for everyone involved . i envy thme
11005,"probably sacd for cumberand lol , but yea they can learn vrom it"
11006,hey can learn that football is not their sport .
11007,"lol 7es , i didnt realize the aver5age nfl game ha sonly 11 minutes of actual gameplay"
11008,teh oplayer sunion has ensured5 hat work time i wminimal . teh fans are steamed about it but whatc an they do ' put in other players ?
11009,"i dunno , to be honest , i dont know that players would tak much more than 11 minutes of high speed contact ."
11010,"with the chips in teir pads , we cwn monor them until it is too much , then put in otehr players . technology al,ows us to maximize gmaeplay ."
11011,yu . alsxo makes for good explanatiomse on tv
11012,"yes , i figure that the fans deserve to know the exact time and place that each concussion happens . thdy paid a lot of money zso teh data should be thers ."
11013,"for medical reasons , too . ajnd to show the speed ofa thletes ."
11014,i guess the atheltes are in danger on the field . they should be protected . i think that gneetic engineering is a good way to build stronger players . th4 nfl should start an enineering firm to build the better player .
11015,be ready for the first sub 4 . 0 r4 0yard dash
11016,"that is just a matter of time and engienering . i know that we wipl have the first superspritner in the world . anyway , great chat ! keep on running !"
11017,imagine a 250 pound guy running 4 second 40 . kinda scary .

11022,"i love football here in clevelnad ohio ! but , i wish the saints would'be made it i n."
11023,hi ! i'm in se ohio . i do too . do you follow the eagles at all ?
11024,i know about the eagles . my brother doesn't live to fzr from there . . . he's in lancaster . i don't know about that qb carson wentz though . . . guy can't stay healthy .
11025,thats true . always getting hurt . i'm more appalachia then colubmus . could you imagine a football svore of 220 now ? that would be impossible !
11026,"lol . . . . not playing aganst the browns it wouldn't for thep ast 20 years . that's an awfu, lot of football sckring ! what city you live in ?"
11027,i remember how nig lebron james was when he came home to cleveladn . w2e thouhgt he wa sgoing to make cleveland big . aroundc ambridge .
11028,"onh , heck . my brother used to live in coshocton . . . you're not far from mea t all . yes , lebron was huge ! and we were big for a year at least . not really caringf or the national football league ahd geir refs this year . . . i feel like the super bowl was rigged in the teams ghey got ."
11029,i agree . seems really strange . do you remember wehn they started using those yellow lines on the tv for football ? espn wpn an emmy for that !
11030,no kidding ? i never knew it won an emmy . iut makes it easier seeing the first down though .
11031,"it does . i have family cuyahoga falls ., green ellis has neve fujbled a baqll !"
11032,i think you just jinxed him . . . lol . cuy6ahogq falls isn't a bad town . i'm thinking on moving there . and i might listen to the super bowl on hte radio if i can't get my tv to work .
11033,"that a good idea . there is a lot of train trasffic though , so you may hafve to turn the radio or tvg up a bit ! would you watch a female bfl league ?"
11034,"perhaps ? football i think is rough for anyone to be playing . though , i've known some women in my life that coul definitely play ."
11035,": , an nfl gmae only has 11 minutes of live play . i think women could do 9g ."
11036,"yes , i've heard about that only 11 minutes of gameplay hting . ord d. . . it usually takes me a 6pack o beer to watch all 11 minutes of livce footnball !"
11037,i figure it takes that for a lot of people ! do you think your radio will wor kin cuyahogaf alls ? rad9io waves will have o go thru a lo tof metal around there .
11038,"i didn't realize cuyahoga falls had that bad o a problem ., my radio would probably pick up cleveland stations . hey ! i'm gpad we had this talk ! have a really greay day !"

11042,good evening ! planming to watch any football thi sweekend ?
11043,"hello , unfortunately i dont watch football , but tyere are some interesting facts here . snoop dogg wrote a fight song df0or his son;s high school football team ."
11044,i didn?'t know that . i bet the songy was probably half as long as the live gameplay in an nfl game . for a four hour game there are like 11 minutes of actual gameplay !
11045,"yeah thats ridiculous ha . the high school football stadium in allen , texas seats 18 , 00o and cost 60 million to build"
11046,high school football in 6exas is a whole different thing . it is still a tough profession for those that make it . engineers make more in a lifetime than an nfl player .
11047,yeah remember that movie varsity blues ? football is pretty serious htere . 14 of the world;s 25 largest stadiums belong to azmerican college football teams .
11048,"wow ! just think in the 1960s , top bowlers , yes ,b owlers ! , made twice as much of the top football ppayers of that era ."
11049,ha6s crazy since football players put themselves at risk everytime they play !
11050,"that's true . sadly , maryland's jordan mcnair died of heatstroke in june , so there are real risk s."
11051,"those humungous american falgs at football stadiums weigh 1 , 100 pounds and cost 50 , 00 0to make"
11052,spared no expnewse i guessd . they will be rolling out those falgs this weekend as the playoff are starting with the final field o fsix teams in each conferenced ecidedl ast week .
11053,who is in the playoff s?
11054,"the american football conference has kansas city , new england , la chargers , indianapolis , houston , adn baltimore ."
11055,"nice , who is your team ? or who are you rooting for"
11056,"i have a soft spot for the patrioits , but would liek to see either kansas city or the charger swin it . by the way , in the national footbal lconference it is new orpeans , al rams , chicago , philadelphiua , seattle , and dallas ."
11057,"nfl hses tracking chips embecddec in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footbalsl to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
11058,"cunny how they inves tso much , but then at eam like new orleans goes even further and forbids players and cheerleaders from eat6kng at the same restaurant . sadly , if the cheerleader is there first and a layer comes in , the cheerldeader has to leave !"
11059,haha thats ridiculous ! ceherleaders also dont get paid for travel; ezpenses . i knew someone who was a cheerleader for the lakers
11060,that's really cool . did she hav ea lot of stories ?
11061,"not really ,s he wasnt allowed to interact with the players at akl . plus , it was justh er side job ."
11062,i bet she hsd the best seat in the house for home games . great chat !
11063,are you a fan of th enfl ?
11064,i am a fan of the nfl ! what about you ?
11065,"me too , nad college footall 12 do you have a favorite team"

11067,"i have heard of them , they aqre my favorite team . i like the pink look to it , what do you think of it ?"
11068,i wonder if it is a mental thing to throw off the opponents ?
11069,"it is , it is basically psycho;ogy 101 . pink has a natural calming effect and rlaxes the players lol"
11070,interesting . do you know how muc hbowler smade in the 1960s ?
11071,"i don't know exactly , but i know kt wa salmost double the nfl salary , which is crazy to think abour"
11072,i know ! i guss bowling was more popular bqck in the day .
11073,i think so too . bowlin is fun but i can't wai tit like football . do you listen to the radio much ?
11074,"yes , i love the radio . what about you ?"

11080,is that from soldiers in wwii ?
11081,"yep , they made them with razor blades and a pencil , i wonder how they made it work"
11082,that is s9 fascinating . hes i have no idea how that tuens into a radio .
11083,"me neither , straight engineering lo, . it was so nice chatting with yhou ! enjoy your night !"
11084,are you a fan of football ?
11085,i love football . i am a steelers fan . how about you ?
11086,my team is the redskins to e honest .
11087,did you know the highest score ever in a football game was w22 0 .
11088,no i didn't . do you know what team it was ?
11089,yeah it was georgia ech vs cubmerland . ge3eorgia tech stomped them on fhat rday in 1916 .
11090,hilarious . i didn't even know georgiat ech was aroundb ac kthen . go figure .
11091,well in the 1960s football players made a lo tless money . in fact to bowlers actually made more money .
11092,interesting . have youy seen that movie kingpin with bill murray ?
11093,i dont think i havd saw taht one . is it good ?
11094,wel it isa bout bwlers in the 60s and how they are semi celebri8ties .
11095,i might have to chgecj thwt one out . did you hear about espn winning the award vfor 5the yello lije that shows first down marker ?
11096,"i did , i wonder if they won awards for thw thing that follows the hockey p7cdk in hockey ?"
11097,i dont watch hockey so im not even sure what your talking about to be honest with you .
11098,"lol , no worries . do ou listen yo the radiko ?"
11099,i was just listening to jupiters radio storms on amr adio lst night .
11100,"interesting , waht staftio was it on ?"
11101,i kjust remember that t was lon am radio . i listen to that whne i get tired of listening to all the classical radio dramas . there is a website for that ?
11102,interesting . did you kno you can make a radio out of a razorblade and penvil ?
11103,"yeah i would love to try to bui,d one . you know just to see if i can ."
11104,"that would be cool . well , nice chatting with you !"
11105,nice chattin gwith you ws well . have a grat day .
11106,"hey , how you doingt here '?"
11107,wobnderful ho wabout you
11108,i'm grtea t! have you heard of the sport called football ?
11109,yes ! i live in america and just watched the superb owl ! what qbout you ?
11110,"sometimes i watch thes b . i think it's funny that n the 60's blwers made twice as much as top gfoobtall sftwrs ,"
11111,also find that funnmy . are you from tye us ?
11112,i am . k grew up there . many of my frieds are america n. are you from the us ?
11113,yes i am . crazy that there are no written rules against female players
11114,"i thinkt hat women would add class to the game . thry couold be punters , kickers , placeh olders . they are a bunch of j9bs that women could do !"
11115,female soccer playere should be punters .
11116,"or kick3rs . that would be great ! little girls would dream ofb ecoming football players ! then again , they should probably dream of being engineers . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earninhs of an nfl player and an average mlb player ."
11117,i am guessing that is because their career lengths are longer .
11118,"that's true . plius you gotta be real smart , and i am certainly not that . an average nfl game only has 11 inutes of live gameplay . that's pretty good pay on a per minute basis ."
11119,haha radios i ncanada are requires 40 perent of music played to be canadian .
11120,canadians wnt equality ! they wan to make sure that tjer own artists grt airplay .
11121,seri9ously ! guess it is nt the worst idea .
11122,i think the storms on jupiter proably7 sound better than moat of the top 40 on he radio these days .
11123,id efinitely agree with that . crazy that rsdios can pick up fehs torms in uopiter .
11124,"there are many crazy things on the radio these days , a finnish radio station has broadcast 'nuntii latini' a weekly enws progtram conducted entirely in classical alrin"
11125,that is fascinatimg .
11126,"i know ! i8sn't it ? anyhows , nice chatting with youse !"
11127,you a swell !
11128,oh yeah .
11129,heyt here do you like watching foobtall
11130,hi ! i love watching football . my favorite team is the green bay packers . how about you ?
11131,"oh i love the paztriots , i love watching hte gmaes but its sad but true there only 11 mins of gameplay on qverage in the whole game"
11132,tnat's crazy once you think about it ! thd games last for about 3 hoursa nd theh only plqy for 3 . makes me 3onder how in shape they truly are then lol
11133,"haha good question ! , what are your thoughts on the chips that the nfl uses to track players ?"
11134,"i never knew about that until noe and i con't like kt ! there's already replay allowed , i don't ened every player tracked to tell me more info . wha tdp you tink of it ?"
11135,"ya it is scary , its good for stats because it showw velocity and rotation and stuff , i just want to keep it on thde field ya know"
11136,very true ! what do ou tni8n about the jhighest scoring gam eas coming from college ? crazy high too !
11137,ya that score is insand ! 2220 cumberland must have felf horrible
11138,i'm surprised georgia tech even kept trying . . . a tthat point 9 think you'd give pity . do you prefer to watch games on tv or listen to them on fhe radio ?
11139,"well i like to watch games , i dont use the radio muc h, do yoy ?"
11140,i prefer to watch the games . its' difficult when they're tlaking about players numbets and position on the field to envision it alla t once .
11141,"righyt i agree with you , good thinge spn created the yellow line , it makes it easier to follow th egames on tv"
11142,i love the yellow line ! what do you thin kabout ' football ' in other countries . . . aka soccer or rugby ?
11143,"well i don't like it myself , i like football , but yes i'm glad espn won a emmy for that !"
11144,"i enjoy watching soccer during the world cup or in olympics , but that's about it . funhny what an rmmy canb e won for !"
11145,"thats true , do youe ver watch bowling on t v?"
11146,"no , i'm not a fan of watching bowling , but i do enjoy going bowling at times . what do you think bout the saints cheeeleaders having to leave ar estauratn if a player com3s in ?"
11147,"ya i think thats really dumb and outdated , i'm shocked they don't sue or sometihing over that , evryone is so sue happy th3se days"
11148,"yes . it's bad enough that they can't be 9n the same restaurant , but to have to leave when 6you were there first . . .b arbaric !"
11149,"i agree with you o nthat , they should use the radio o warn each other where they will be at allt imes haha"
11150,"hi , how are you ? do you listen to the radio ?"
11151,"hey there i do listen to the radio sometimes , i didn;t npow that you could create a radio out of a razor blade in a pencil though , did you know that ?"
11152,id id not know that . i wonder hw good that radio i though . wha tcan it pick up ?
11153,yes i have no idea how it works . but i do know tat they used it in world war ii
11154,that is quite inventive in any case . i dont listeb to radio much now . i did when i was youngerf .
11155,yes i agree . i mostly just6 listenbt o youtube wheh i'm uib the car . do you everl isten to canadian radio by the way ?
11156,i have listened to canaeian radio . it is mostly like american radio .
11157,the one hting that is different is that it is required to have 40 percent canadianj conent k so tat m4ans that 40 percent of the radio time is made up of canadia nartists
11158,"yeah , i remember hearing a lot of ruhs , bneil young , loverboy . that makes sense ."
11159,yeah and there's probably some justin bieber being played too habha . would ypu ever listen to a jupiter radio storm on your radio by the way ?
11160,i cant imagin elistening to a storm on jupiter . maybe the solar activity on the sun ?
11161,yeah tha tmight be interesting l it also migh tbe nteresting to listen to a new station that is red in classical latin ebcause i would not understand any of it lol
11162,"how amny people actually listen to broadcast , i wonder . it is an odd taste , thts for sure ."
11163,"y3es i wonder how many people can undersgand classical latin these days , and apparently there is a onine radio station tuhat will play thousands of episodes of radio deamas , and they are completely fre , i wonder if they are any good"
11164,i would ratherl isten to those old radio shows . they sound mkre inte4eestign . i dont think the kidss are interested though .
11165,"no i think you're right unfortunately . on a separate note though , dk you ever listen to football on the radio ? apparently wojeb are allowed to play for the nfl if they are goode enough"
11166,i dont listen to football on the radio . i used tk listem to baseball on the radio . women kn the nfl ? i wojder if that will ever happen .
11167,"yeah u don't know . but i also don't kno whow an av3rage nfl gaqme only has about 10 mkinutes of live gameplay , especially since it seems to take hours to watch on tv lkl"
11168,"yeah , the spectacle draws a lot of interst , but really it is short lied . i just watcht he highlights . that is enough . anyway , great chat !"
11169,"ye great chat . and next time you're watching again look ut for the trackin gchips thatft he nfl puts in the player shoulder pads , they can tell all kinds of stats just from how those chips wre moving like velocity and rotation !"
11170,thats true ! have a god nigh t!
11171,"thank you you to0 ! ad keep in mind that the nfl was created 1920 , it's so lon gago so that probably e4xplains their crazy ryles"
11172,are you a football fan ?
11173,sure ! i like the nfl . yow about you ?
11174,i like it . i wonder if we'll ever see a woman play in it .
11175,"yeah , that would be cool . though , i can't blame womenf or not wanti8ng to be a par tof a noto5iously sexist indust5y ."
11176,there's no written rule that says they can't play . maybe we cpuld se ea woman kicker one day .
11177,"yeah , i've read that somewhere . i jut don't tuink women would neessarily want to be a part of the industry . it doesn't s3em like a comfortabl ewoeking environment . do you have a favorite nfl team ?"
11178,i'm a redskins fan . what about you ?
11179,il ike the cowboys . did you know the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 ?
11180,i remmber hearing that . they were probagly paid in ;pennies . bowlers used to make more money than hem .
11181,"that's crazy . coaches are paid really wlel , too ."
11182,do you ever listen to games on the radio ?
11183,sometimes . but i do love the radio . i'ts kind of nostalgic .
11184,yeah . did you know that soldiers used to make radio out of razorblades as pencils ?
11185,"yeah , they called them foxhole rarios . i wonder wuha they could pic up on them ."
11186,who knows . maybej upiter . jupiter has storms so big that you can hear them on am radio .
11187,"that's pretty cool . or more likely , bing crosby . evidently , they estimate that bingc rosbyr wcordings filled ove rhalf the radio tima lloczted for muxic in1 948 ."
11188,"wow , that's crazy ;. in canada , 40 percent of the music you play has to be from canadian artyjsts ."
11189,that' svery patriitic of them . did yuou know tehe's a radio station that translates oar activity ?
11190,i did not . i've headrd about a radio station in finlans that is conducted entirely in latin .
11191,"that's cool . but yeah , not only does the radio station translat the sun , you can listen to thes un's music . i wonder what it sounds like . well , it's been nice chatting with you !"
11192,i wonder the same thig . taek car .
11193,"ehllo , do you like football ?"
11194,"hi . it' snot my favorite thing in the world , but i am surprised that tnere is a rocket scinetistr w2ho coaches ."
11195,hello . did you know iowa painted the opposing team locker room pink ?
11196,"i did . htat's hilarious , and it must have been an intimidation tactic . i wonder if gt had theirs painted pink durijg that 2220 win overc umberland ?"
11197,lol . taht's such a crazy score for a football game .
11198,i tis . did you know that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for hid son's school '? i wonder if it is rapped .
11199,i did not knw that .g reenellis uas never fumbled the football in his nfl career .
11200,"that's amazing . i'm moee than a little annoyecd to realize that teh highest paid employees in the repartmen tof defense , are football coaches . that eeds to be 5ethought ."
11201,i think so too . do you listne to the radio ?
11202,"i do . i'm trying to find that station that translates solar soud , so you can lsten to the music of the un ."
11203,that would be very cool . i heard you can hear jupite rstorms on earth .
11204,i would like to hear those too . i didn't know bill murray voiced a radio show in the 70's .
11205,"htat's funny i didn't know that either . in canada , it's a law for all radio stztions to play at last 40 percent of canadina music ."
11206,"are there even that many anadina artis5s ? i cannot believe that there are people who don't know who hanson is , and that the dj in chicago was aboe to get away with playing it on an alternative station ."
11207,i have no idea lol .s oldiers in wwii made simple radios usin g arazorblade and pencil as the diode .
11208,"my grandfaher showed me how to do that . i guess bing crosby was very popular in 1948 , he dominated thea irplay ."
11209,that's interesting . do you like the nfl ?
11210,it's okay . i hear ther dis a coach who used to be a rocket scientist .
11211,i have heard taht too . wonder if he made the embeddef chips to trac players ?
11212,"maybe ? or the ones in the footballs ? i think he was an aeronautics engineer , that would make sense if he was involved ."
11213,"i think it's in their pads .a nyway , it was great talking to you !"
11214,o do you know much baout football ?
11215,"i know its a league consisting of 32 teams . : , i watch some , grew up with it in the houde ."
11216,"i don't know toom uch , i do know that iowa's visitor's locker is painted pink !"
11217,"that's crazy . omen players are allowed , there's no written rule against them ."
11218,really ? i didn;t know that ! good thintg !
11219,"an average game only has1 1 wctua. minutes of gameplay ! those games take hours , i can't belive how little of it is actually athletic ."
11220,"wow ! they seem so much longer . the players seem to make a lo tof money , bu tover a lifetime , engineers will , make more ."
11221,no way ! that's one of those vrwzy hard to believe facts . like that new orleans saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a player comes in to eat while they are there .
11222,hat ? tahts' insane ? hut there are no rules agains tthem playing ?
11223,"i've eard it from sa reliabl esource : , they still have to meete ligibility reqhuirements , just like the nen havse to ."
11224,funny . i heard that the highest score in a game was 2220 1q must ave been a great game to watch !
11225,onl7 if you were kn te winning side . imagine how zwful the losing team felt .
11226,"ha ! i know , it mus tbe horrilbe to live with that for the rest of your life ! !"
11227,"well at least it happened in 1916 , no one heqrd about it like they would in today's world ."
11228,"very true ! speaking of a while ago , you know that top bowlers mad3 2x more than rop footbzall player in the 60's ?"
11229,bowlers were definitely top tier in the 60's . how funny is that ?
11230,"i know , but you think o fhow much footabll players make now , its crazy !"
11231,all professionl athletes are paid a lot . like a fridiculous amount really . it's crazy to think about .
11232,i know that's why i was hwppy to see thwt entgineers make mor eover a lifetime . even thogvh many professions should .
11233,tha tis definitely true . my ex is an engineer and he pulls in bank .
11234,i guess a lot comes wit being a football lplayer . the nfl actually uses trackoing chips to record their movements on the filed .
11235,that's nuts . nice chatying with you !
11236,do you like football ?
11237,i do . u of iowa painted the visito rlocked room pink

11262,"yeah , h'es reallyt alented ad shouldn't have been out o fthe league at all . for as imple protest not to ki lafrican americans st a disproportional rate compared to whites ."
11263,"football is a family of team sports that ibvovle , butw e become one antion to achieve for the nation ."
11264,"although some find him cowardly , i find kaepernjck extremely brave forg iving up football to take a stadn agwins tpolice killing his people . shat are your thoughts ."
11265,he is best player but the football missed him very much .
11266,"yea . i get sad when people bang on him but i find him strong and abe to start the movement . i find more white people unwilling to learn about him and the movmeent , which makes it tought o argue with them . . ."
11267,television sometimes shortene dto tele is a reat communication medium .
11268,"yes , it is . is there a favorite communication meidum that you like ?;"
11269,vetry much . television is a mass medium for advertising .

11280,"awell , i much less , i find out . and i see that program , i like it"
11281,"did you know that hte yighest score in football game was 2220 , but it was really while ago . it's surorisin gfact ."
11282,"yes , i ahd read something in particulr about it , it's something surprising . they should have played alon ein the field , that team weighed hte other"
11283,i was always surprised that there isn'ta ny written rule against female playere in nfl . and still don't understan dwhgy women don't play
11284,"it's a veey strange thing , therea re many wome ncapable fort hese types of sports , but goo d."
11285,"i agree . well , maybe with average nflg ame only 11m inutes of live gameplay , it's not interesting for ladis ."
11286,there will come a time when the first will be encouraged and so will the others
11287,did y9u know that new orleans saints ceerleaders are forbidden from eatin gin thss amw restaurant as any nl player
11288,"how curious is that ? well , i have some thought of some because of it , but . what do you think ?"
11289,i think it's kind of stupid and old style rule . it doesn't make anys ense .
11290,"well , i suppose it's because of creating bonds int he middle of all this , its' not good for players o have their head i nsomething else"
11291,": , it could be true . however , to require to ,eave a place when nfl palyer comes . . . well , u'm not sure in tha . , ."
11292,"wea re not sure of anyfhing , they are pure speculations . . . but we must not remove the possibility"
11293,true . did you know ghat locker room forv isiting team in the university of iowa is completely panted pink ?
11294,"or yes , yes . . . laso today something about this , it is rumored that it is for the visiting team to know that they are better and th9s feel.s less"
11295,"some people may call it as sort of pressure , hbut i'm not sxure ."
11296,"to me that could cause m,er ather desirwe to coer their mouths and beat them 6o lear n.b ut hey , all this is part of the show"
11297,i agree . nfl is all abou tperformance !
11298,"well of course . what is worth there is the besf performance , th better the teams , teh better the matches"
11299,yes ! my pleasure to talk with you . have a good day !
11300,"also , have a great day"
11301,heplo hows it goung ? do you like football ? i didn't know women can play in the nfl .
11302,i didn't know that either ! it's poxsibls they only allow it b4cause they think it very unlikely a woman will make a team .
11303,"yeah , i don't ever see any play for the nfl tgough lo maybe they just value their healt h, it is scary being a footnall player they get injured all the time"
11304,"y4ah , i wonder if thst is why they don't mkae more than teh average engineer ! their careers tend to be short with all of the injuries"
11305,"it looks like the use to tecuhnology has been bneeficial to football , they put tracking chips in their players !"
11306,"that is cray to me , the technology that is i nnfl games now . lik ehow they were saying that the last time that jim nantz called a dallaswashington game , it was so much less technical . no first down lines ,n o facny replays ."
11307,"the replays nowadays are excelent , the frane by frame picture and the playback and forwar d. its amazin . also , the way the announcers can kinda draw on the screen , really techy tuff ."
11308,i can't decide if i like th technology o rnot . it helps make things fair and makes it noce to watch . but it probably slows things down . it was pretty eydopening that an average game only has 11 minutes of actuall ive gameplay
11309,"yeah , you are probably right m 11 minutes of gme play but thea ctual event last like 3 hours ! lol"
11310,"yep , though somehow , i still atcfh and enjoy the games . i cana ctually remember the season that jim last ca.led that game , ecause the cowboys beat my team thst year when they won the superbowl ! crszy tot hink back that far"
11311,in the 1960 d bowlers mae m9re than football players . i guess a lot mor epeople watched bowling more back then !
11312,"ha ! i can' teven imagine that . it shows how much football has changed in he last 60 years ,h ow much pkaters earn now versus then"
11313,"i know right , supe5 interesting what was more popular back then ."
11314,"i g7ess i am a pretty casual fan , because ih ad never nogiced the ' crossflexing ' thign before . it is interesting how much they play tje ratings numbers now , to get thje best games at the best times . i didnt' know that 80 percent oft he country gott aht late afternoon game"
11315,"that is a weird tactic , painting the opposing temas locker room pink ? i wonder what that does ?"
11316,"anyt5hing to get inside their head , i guess ! i gues it is implying they're gi5ly ? the thing that stuck ot to me as being the oddest fact was that the saints cheerleaders can't deat in the xame restaurant as an nfl player ! i wonder what the reason for that is"
11317,"probably they can't ibnterac twith football pl;ayers because a disxtraction ? maybe . it's pretty rude , like wat if they are not doje eating ! ?"
11318,"the nfl relaly is kind of a crazy hting , because this country is just so into it . i cna't even believ ethe tv cntracts . a billion dollars for the rights to just half of the gams isn uts ! but they can make money on it ebcause the country is full of such rabid fans"
11319,"true , football is a huge money maker . i kinda don't undeerstand it though , liked why ts s popular , so many brewks , only 11 min of gameplay , injured all the timr , a ton of penalties , switching out players , ogfense and defense ey c."
11320,"in a close gwme , thes low pace kind of makes the splash plays that much more exciting . then again tehre are games like that last cowboysredskin sgame they mentione d, where the cowboys just racked up 38 unanswered points . and hwen it's that easy for a feam , it's kind of fn to watch your team do wll like that ."
11321,"true . its goodc hatting , see ya !"
11322,are you a fan of either the redsokins or cowboys ?
11323,well i9 prefer the redksins personally . bug i do think the cowboys have a good team this year . hwat do you think ?
11324,"i also like the redskins but the cowboys have a better team , at least thjis season ,"
11325,yep i agree . what do you yhink about the cowbys coach jason garrett ? i think he?s detfinitely on the ball right npw
11326,"i think he was a great backup for aikman and he is goind a good job , he just needs a better team to get to the superbowl"
11327,"speaking of football , what do you think about the nfl ? who's your favo0rite team"
11328,"i love the nfl , my favorite team are the patriots . they are the best tema int he league now"
11329,yes i also love the patriotgs and i lov3 tom brady ! do you 5thin kthat the nfl will ever have fenale oplayers in it though
11330,"i dont thinks o , tehy seem to be at a disadvange there , its a gamr of strength so maybe as a kicker"
11331,"7es i could see a kicker , i also could see them putting tracking chips on fmale players in order to compare the stats to male players"
11332,"i heard the balls also have a tracking chip in them , used to get different interesting stats of th edame"
11333,"yes they can gwt things like rotation and velocity of the ball which is interesting , i wonder i fthat's how they figured out hat there are only about 11m inutes of gameplay n an average nfl gane"
11334,"only1 1 minutes ? that seems unfair for the public , last superbowl lasted like 3 hours"
11335,yep i agr3e that's a lot oif commercials lol . dod you watch the super bowl on tv or did you go to the game
11336,"on tv tickets are just too expensive for my budget , great game though , watched it with friends at home , what about you ?"
11337,"guess i watched it on tv . that's abourt the only tim ewhen i do watch tv because i mostly watched youtune stuff , i always like to watch souht park as well what about you"
11338,"south park was oen of my favorite show si also liked the simpsons ,"
11339,did you evers ee the episode where south pwrk made fun of family guy ? and then apparently afterwards the simpsons creator sent south park flowers because the show wa sso spoton lol
11340,"i did , that was a funny one l i guess the crew from both hows are friends with each other"
11341,"yes i tgink so . did you ever watch the show pokemon by the 2way ? i watched it a lot when i was in middle school , and apparently there are over 800 episodes now . i would never be able to ' catch ' them all"
11342,"i used to oge the show , watches the original sedries with 150 pokemons ,"
11343,"i watch far too much tv , are you a fanh of televisiuon ?"
11344,"yea , i like watching snlk , their longest running skit is weekend update"
11345,i love that skit . are you a fan of the simpsons ?
11346,"yea , il ove homr . in the first 400 epksodes he held 188 jobs !"
11347,wow ! that's an insane amount of jobs . did you know there is only one episode whereb art does not appear nad is ot mentioned ?
11348,"no , that's crazy considering how many episode there are . they recently had daniel radcliffe do a cvoic eon treehouse o horror xxi"
11349,id id not know that . i missed it . did you s4e the familyg uy epidode of sout park where t6hey pointed outt hat family guy ripped off the simpsons virmat ?
11350,"yea , those south pakr episodes weref un o watch on tv"
11351,i agree . after that epiode aired the simpsons crew sent the south park crew flowers ha ha .
11352,nice . have youe ver watched shark tank ? it turns out most deals on th eshow are bever enacted
11353,i am aware of it nad how it works but i've nevefr seen an episofde .
11354,quite deceptive . apparently shakespare's the two noble kinsmen has never been adapted for tv or film
11355,i wouldh ave thought theyw ere all adapted by now . are you aware of the show thosms the tank engine ?
11356,"yea , i've seen a few episode ont he telly as a k9d"
11357,"did you know that ringo starr , ald cbaldwin , and george carlin have all narrated for hte show ?"
11358,"no , that's pretty crazy . did yku know the player in football games have tracking chios embedded i nhteijr equipment ?"
11359,i did hear that itw as on their person and also on the football . i wonder what they use that data for ?
11360,"i kjow they use the chips to trck the footbqlls velocity , speed , rotation , and locaztion"
11361,i wonder why they don't use that datat o help mak ecalls then instead of just relying on reviews ?
11362,the nfl should also use the data from the chips to help with plzayers safety
11363,ia greew ith that as wepl .
11364,"hello , do you lie football ?"
11365,"sure , i'm a big cowboys fan , personally . hw about you ?"
11366,"i dotnr eally follow football too much , but i watch 9t once in awhile , i like the 4e9rs ."
11367,"yeah , i find it hard to avoid aftera while . conside4ing the regular season runs pdactically foutr months , then has several months of postseason , it can get a little ' in y9ur face ' o ntelevision ."
11368,"absolutely , sometimes i dont even realize im watching ut , like on thanksgiving or something lol"
11369,"and thsen finally , the first sunda7y in february when everything shurs down for the super bowl ."
11370,"yeah , i hear ya lol did you know the nlf uses tracking chips ?"
11371,"yeah , on both the players and the balls ? they want to be able to trackm everything , i guess ."
11372,yeah i guess stats mean a lot in that sport . its kinda sad tuat there is only 11 min of gfame play yet the event probably takes about 3 hours .
11373,that must be one of the many reasons engineers make more money oved a lifetime than a football playsr .
11374,yeah and the injuries ! you hardly hear about an engineer gettfing injured affecting his careser .
11375,"haha . yrah , you rarely hear about an engineer only have a fifteen yea rcareer because his body finally gave out on him ."
11376,"right ! maybe they would ge ta sprained wrist from being at the computer so much , but usually nothing serius . lol"
11377,"they're too busy getting pid and amking the tracking chips tha6 go in football sto worry about it . did you know back in the 60s , bowlers actually made mor ethan football players ?"
11378,"that is 5eally amazing , real ood time to be a bowler !"
11379,defiknitely . did you know there's no written rule preventing women vrom playing in the nfl ?
11380,"i did , i had no idea bedore i read it . i wonfer why we dont see more women playing football ."
11381,"probably because it's an infredibly sexist industry , and would be a vwry hostilke working environm3nt ."
11382,well therea re very mkasculine women who train and build up to play those types of sports . i've seen them at hte gym . i met a woman who played rugby before !
11383,"oh , definitely ! i'm not saying women areen't capable of playing . i'm saying fhe league is very unfair towardw omen . they look away from the wifebeaing and sexual harassment dcandals . in fact , a saints cheerleader has to get p from the restaurant where she is eating if a player walks in ."
11384,yeah that is very rude . why not come up with an itienrary so cheerleaderse known ot to go there instead of thwt happening where they might have fo leave mid mea l. . anyways been great chatting !
11385,do you like the nfl ?
11386,"i do actually , di dyou know tha twomen can paly too ?"
11387,yes there is not rule that prevents them from playing
11388,yes as long as they can emet the requirements they are good to play
11389,yeah . did you know there are only 11 minutes of gameplay ?
11390,yeqh and yet we are glued to the 5tv for hours
11391,yeah . did you know engineers make more money though over thel ifetime ?
11392,wel they do ahve longerc areers too though so that maes sense
11393,yeah they have more time to make money if you think it that way
11394,yeah . did you hear of thatr ule for saints cheerleaders ?
11395,yes theya re not allowed to eat in the same3 restaurant as the players
11396,"yes and worst , ghey also have to leave mid meal when they walk ibn"
11397,yeha it is sexist and it needs to go eally
11398,i agree . u og iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
11399,wow i wonder ikf that is supposed to huave some impac ton them
11400,i wonder too . bwleds made more money in the 60s that footbll players
11401,"woiw i guess it was a much more popul,ar sport back in the day than fooball"
11402,yeah true . do youk now what the highest score in college footabll is ?
11403,yes it is q220 znd georgia tech beat cumberlnd
11404,yeah what a score that must have been even for 1916
11405,yeah that is crazy good . nic echatting with you .
11406,what di you think about eric reid ? you think people are not signing him because he's bad or because he won't stand for the national anthem
11407,i would think that would be a reason why teams weren'ts igning the 2013 firstr round pick out of lsu .
11408,yep i think so . him and colin kaepernick definitely got the shor tend of the straw after they started their activism
11409,yes they did . they first did it ebfore a game in sept . of 201 6and have had nothing but prob.ems since then .
11410,yep it's interesting 5hat he had an 8 . 4 million dollar contract and he essentially threw it away byu refusing to stand
11411,wow . i didn't nowh ow much it cost hk m. id o know though tjat the average lifetime earnings of an enineer are higher compared to that of the lifetime earnings of an average nfl or mlb playe4r .
11412,"yep you're right about that . also 6h eaverage nfl game only last for about 10 minutes of actual gameplay , the rest is just referees and stnading around lol"
11413,"lol for tghat short amount of time , they do a good job of dragging it out to 3 hours . did you know there's no written rule agazinst female players ? i wonder if we'llp see on at some point . . . maybe a kicker ?"
11414,"that's what i' mthinking , we could probably see a kicker , i just hope that she can zttend a restaurant with othuer players , unlike chbeerleaders , they're not allowed nad they havet o leave if a fooball player enters the restaurant"
11415,that is the strnagesy rule . what do you think of thw tracking chips they are using to record dat ain plagers shoulde rpads znd footballs ? seems like the7're are really getting tefhnical .
11416,"i think it's interesting that they ca ntramc the stats like rotation and speed , i just hopoe they can turn the tracking off once the players lave the field"
11417,yes . do you kw what the highest scoring footbakl game eve4r was ?
11418,yes it was between georgia tech and cumberland right . wasn't the score like 222 to 0 o0r skmething crazy
11419,holy smokes !t nat's a blowout . in hte 1960's top bowlers mde twice as much as top fotball stars of yaht era . times have chawnged since then .
11420,yep it' sdefinitely the reverse these days . did you know that espnw on an emmy ? they did it when tehy createds the yelow line it shows first dwns on tv brodcast sof football games
11421,i didn't know they won one fo rthat . i love that line . changed the way we watch football . do you watch a lot of television ?
11422,"yes i watch television from time to time , i really like watching pokemon because it reminds me 0f my childhood , they're aljmost 800 episodes now"
11423,"wow . my kids were really into it , and even now they are in their 30s they still love it haha , . did you ever wafch that 70s show ?"
11424,yes i used to watch that shiw a lort . wha ti don't like i sthat they try to recreate it in the uk market . it actually flopped over there lol
11425,lol i heard about that . they called it days like these . did you know that in the simpsons there is only 1 episode that bart isn't in and ixn't mentioned ?
11426,"that's what i heard but i never saw that wpisode , do you think they just forgot about him ? 3what do you thinka bout the episode of southpark where they made fun of family guy ? afterwards the simpsons creator sent the south park creators a set of flowers"
11427,do you watch much teloevision ?
11428,i ;ove watching the telly ! do you hve any favorite shows ? i like snl and the simpsons .

11437,"really ? i wlonder why that is , do you know why ?"

11443,"i love football , i like both college and nfl , how about you ?"

11470,yes i did . th eafc champion patriots won the game
11471,"yup . . . zgain . . . . i'm a raven's fan . tony romo did a nice job . i wonder how jason witten would have done , but he's affiliated w2ith espn so i'm not suyre how that would have wo5ked ."
11472,esn adn the booger moble are awful ! tey lost their sports brodcasting background awhile ago . now its just socia lmedia and adver5tising
11473,"yup , u used to watch sports center religiously , now i might put it on once or twice a year . they really vocus on the nf l, and would really be interested if they ever got a female player . after all , there is no written rule against i t."
11474,would she feel wwid if she got drafted by the saints . where the players and cheerleaders are not allowed ro eat at the same place ?
11475,"yah , that would be awkward . she would walk in an the cheerleaders would have to leave ."
11476,jason witten was a very good player but still needs some work in the boot . maybe he can win espn another emmy
11477,"maybe some day . i liked him during his 15 year career , and drafted him on my fantasy fo9tball team several times ."
11478,hes is second in rec and yards as a te . thats good fantasy production
11479,for sure . he anx dez br6yant back in the day made quite the pza84 . plus catchign balls from troy aikman wasn't too shabbye ither .
11480,ift he average nfl game only has 11 mins of live gameplay . i wonder how much time witten was actually used
11481,goo dpoint . i s6till like wagching it in tv though . never seen any of the over 750 episodes of pokemon though .
11482,thqts 16 years worth ! i dont think iw ould eb able to stand the ads
11483,i don't i'd be able to stand the show . 50 a year ? i couldn't even get through one i bet .
11484,what about trying to find the 1 episode of the simpsons where bart is neitehr mentioend or appears
11485,at ;east i use4d to like that show . haven't seen 8it in years though . i tend to se tv as a mass medium for news . even though you nee dto take it in with a healthy bit of skepticism .
11486,i feel llime if ijt wasnt for news or sports t vwouldnt survive
11487,probably no t. most of the sh9ows are crap now a days .
11488,yeah a show called ' days like these ' only lasted 10 episods in he uk
11489,"yes , i heard that somewhere before . well , it's bee nnice chatting with yoj ."
11490,have a good day !
11491,"hello there , are you an nlf fan ?"
11492,"hey there , ya i love tbe patriots , what abnout you ?"
11493,oh wow 6hen you have been quite spoiled the last decade or so 2
11494,"haha i have ! but not spoiled in once sense , nfl games only have about 11 minutes of gameplay haha"
11495,that is crazy when you htink about it . i know you notice all the stops much mkre when you go to a live game .
11496,"ya thatw true , i havne't been to a live game in a while , what gaem did you go to"
11497,oh i hve bdent o paxker gaems before and i just know youn otice it more when going to 6he games .
11498,"ah i see , whwts crazy is theres no rule aainst fmeale players , would you watch females in the nfl ?"
11499,"i think that would be awesome , they shoudl allow girls in all pro sports , it should be the best players possibel ."
11500,"yup , if they are te bes the nthey should be allowed to play i think"
11501,"exactly , and it would give young girls who are sports fans all kinds of hope and motivation ."
11502,"well fehy shouldn't be too enthused about the salary , do you know an engineer will make more tha na pro nfl player ?"
11503,"yeah i read that , i think it is because the average nfl career is not that long vs . an engineer has a lifetime of working ."
11504,"ya tha makes sense , doesn't make sense though the rulesa bout th esaints cheerleaders , did you hear about those ?"
11505,"yeah i read about those as well , that seems pretty outdated but who knows ."
11506,"ya , like having to gbet up and leave if a playe5r walks intio a bar or restaurant , it seems absurd"
11507,"right , it is a public place , as long as yhey're not breaking any actual laws that hsould b eok ."
11508,what do you think of the chips the nfl usees to track the ball and also players ?
11509,"i think its smart , they need tom ake the game as safe as possible , the hts to the head are dnagerous ."
11510,"thatgs true , i jst worry about those chips being used outside the game , tyats scary stuff"
11511,"that is , well its been nice talking with you , i hope you have a good night ."
11512,do you watch the fnl ?
11513,k sure do . did you now taht wome ncan play too ?
11514,yes there are no rules that prevent them from playinv

11521,the one that they are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players ?
11522,yeah and they also have to leav emid meal if they walk in
11523,it is so sexist and it really need to go by now
11524,i agree . they are also usin gtracking chips on the players now
11525,yes they collect info on velocity and rotation and a bunch 9fs tuff
11526,i hope 5hey can use that to make the game safer too
11527,good point . u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink

11543,"lerbon would be unstkppable as at e for sure , he'd never fumble either . what do you mean by the s fgiants will be close to them ?"
11544,they are moving to a enw arena . it is almost done .
11545,"ah i gotcha , the raixders are going to las vegas teh year after next right ?"
11546,"yeah , good thing thewre is only 11 minutes of actual play . it might be hot there lol ."
11547,it'll be getting really ho tthere . do you watch a lot of tv ?
11548,o worries . i tis inside . i was kidding . yes i watch tv but i stream more .
11549,"yah , tv channels znd stations are kind of rip offs now , you have to pay a ton of money eacxh month and still watch a ton of commercials , not a very good deal . you ever watch any of the 7650 episodes that were made of the show pokemon ?"
11550,it will take m 16 years if i watched one a week
11551,"that's a really long time for sure . i was rather surprised toh ear that there are onlpy two types of tvs still , lback ajd white and colored tv . pretty soon there'll be vr tv lol ."

11559,no one i wasj ust watching i t. hte whole 11 minutes of gameplay
11560,ha ! that's not a lot of game play . did you know ther5e is no rule against females playing ?
11561,yeah i wonder why they do not play though
11562,maybe because they ciuld make more as an engineer .
11563,haha tha tis so true . it js sad how little players make really . the coaches make a lot though
11564,"yeah , they are usually the highest paid in the stafe ."
11565,yeah . snoop dog thoughw rpte a song for his son's football team
11566,really ? iowa's visitn glocker room is pink .
11567,wonder if thewe is a reason behind that
11568,psychological . i am no sure i tworks though because bowlers used to make more .
11569,they did for sure . do you know where isy he largers high school football stadium in the us ?
11570,"no , where ?"
11571,"in allen , texas"
11572,wow . leae it to texas o put too much money into high school foobtall .
11573,i know . it holds 18000 people and cost 60 millio nto build
11574,nice chatting with you !
11575,did you ever watch poekmon ? apparnelty there are over 705 episodes of it
11576,"i rid , and i played pokemon go ,d id you play ?"
11577,"i fid for a bit yes ! i didn'tg get a ton of pokemon but i did play adn i liked i6 , i played the originaol red anfd blue versions on gwmeboy as a kid"
11578,"i liekd payingv the game , but it got redundant where i live . apparently , a lot of people played it ."
11579,"ya thats true , you have to travel to different places to get different pokemon , and only some pomemon were given away ats pecial event s, and some ar elokced to certain coun5ries , itj ust seemed too impossible"
11580,"yeah , i liked the game . i also liked the showt ha5 70s show , appsrently they tried to make a uk version ."
11581,"ya i remsmber rhat , and it was cancelled after like 10 episodes ! oh we.ll they're missing out ovsr there"
11582,i didn't know that ringo starr voice dtank the egune though .
11583,"wow i didn't know tat , i dd know that george calin did some voices for htomas thet ank , i wish he wold sneak in some jokes then i'd actually watch that sho whaha"
11584,"apparently the enw tvsh ave oled , so does the new iphone . i'm debatin gwgether or not to upgtade ."
11585,"ya i dont' know , t depends what your curren tphone is , i have a pixel xl 2 so i have a great phone i'm good waiting for a while"
11586,"lol , i still have the iphone 5s , i've never used a case an ddropped it a million times . it won't die ."
11587,"haha well that phone is pretty old , mayne get a new one so you can qatch nfl gaes on it , apparently the averageg ame only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay"
11588,"not surprising , when i watch the games at the bar , it is mostly clock watching ."
11589,"ya , espeically near the end wnne they're using timeouts , i can't believe in teh 60's that bowlers made more than top footbal lplayers"
11590,"i can believe it . that is crazy , but years ago bowling was likely a more popular sport ."
11591,"ya that's true , it was in the flintstoens and everythijng hhaa ,a lso crazyt hat an engineer will make mre in their lifetime than thw average football player , very shockin"
11592,it has to take into account for the players that don't last long and are low pay .?
11593,"ya thats true , also hte ones that get injured , did you like the simpsons a sa kid ? theres only one episode where bart is both not mentioned and d9esn't appear"
11594,"yeah , bart . he was hilarious back in the day . that show isg reat , i've only seen the first 5 seasons though ."
11595,"ya , wfter season 7 or 8 i think it went downhil , but i did love it as a kid !"
11596,good evening ! are you a football fan or at least looking foreard tot he super bowl tomorrow ?
11597,"i am lookinbg forward to the super bowl tmorrow . most likely , i look forward to the halftime ehow . do you know who's performing ?"
11598,"i heard it is maroon 54 . i'm sure there set will be about 15 to 20 minute slong , which might actually be longer than the axtual live gameplay of the game itsel,f !"
11599,"then , i will definitely be looking forward to them . i hope thjey perform the old songs and map s! however , i will be watching the whole game and the commercials ."
11600,"when i 5tis actual game time , look out for the superimposed yellow first don line , which espn won an emmy for ."
11601,i remember that ! this is getting mor eexciting by every message i see . they deserve it !
11602,i'm glad that spn diesn't get the game though . have you heard any of their issues since taking ove monday night football a while back ?
11603,"what do you mean that they don't get the game ? well , there are a few people considering the job ."
11604,cs hosts the game . obviously espn wil lbe part of it l but i hope that the game is always on ' free ' tv . plus espn just hasn't done that great wit the actual nfl games .
11605,"now , it makes s3nse . is that sarcazsmb ecause jit is never free ? nfl is good overall ."
11606,"i meant for the people watching since nbvc , cbs , or fox usually host the game and those don't cost consumers , beyon dthe television and possbly an antenna , , whereas respn requires additional pay to watch ."
11607,"htat is tru . speaking of television , ' sgark tank ' never enacted most deals . seems reasonable because the products tnhat consumers create seem ridiculous to make it a eality ."
11608,"that is interesting and i never knew tha5t ! it's hard for m enot to see 't ank ' and not think of thomas the tank engind . did you know some famous star like alec baldwin , ringo starr , and george carlin have al narratedt h eshow ?"
11609,i remembered watching the episodes when i was little . and i hear daboug that ! that makes me want to do baxk and identify their voices .
11610,they all have such distinc tvoices too ! it's crazy to tjhink in the relatively early days of televisiont hatb owlers made more than football stars .
11611,"actorsm ake more money than bpwlers and football players . ho3eve r, i heard of htat as well . i wis hbowling was ezsy though ."
11612,"i htink all sports tend to be tough because some people just really have a knack . while i think it might bed ifficult , maybe so,meday a woman will suit up and play in a super bowl since it is technically not agains nfl rules ."
11613,"wel l, they hnabe practices every other day tyo develop strength and stability . i believe so . look at high school footall . coaches are welcoming of both genders to condition into football ."
11614,"yet despite all of that , new orkeans saints cheereladers can't even eat in the same restaurant as te players . if a player walks in the cheerleader has to leave ."
11615,isn't that a little sexist ?
11616,"i don't kno2 the reason for the rule unless they just think it is a bad image ? great chat , enjoy the game and halftime sho wtomorrow !"
11617,did you know that trump wouldn't make the list of top 3 most wealhty president s?
11618,"no , but this isj ust his first term in offixe . . who knows what the future holds ? he might make a blockbuster pop album , like the president of indonesia , which might put him over the top !"
11619,haha that is true we can't count that out ! not just 1 but he could make 3 or more albums if he wants to top that preident of indonesia !
11620,"who kniws . he's friends wiht kanye west these days . it could happen ! i wonder if kanye stayed at the president's guest house when he came to washjngton recently . after all ,t he guest hopuse is bigger than the white house !"
11621,"ya that is widl , you woupd think it'd be the opposie ,c an you imagine if we hadt he ol drules where the runner u0 became vp ? hillary azs vp and trumo as president !"
11622,"i would love to heart rump say to hillary , ' you're fired ! ' i can't imagine the types of things ythe fake media would focus on then . with all the bizarre reporting , at least hey don't call him president banana , which is what they called the first president of zimbabwe"
11623,"haha ya i would lov efor him to have her come into his office and then t4ell her she's fired , do uou watch football ag all ? i guess there is no rule againstw omen palying for the nfl so we will probably see that in our lifetime if they are good enough"
11624,"that is true i the nfl , but i am not sre if it s true in other forms of football , like rugby , canadian football , gaelic football , etc . does that mean we would see male dalls cowboy cheertleaders too ?"
11625,"to be honest noting would surprise me anymore , weren't they talking about making cheerleaders more equivalent and havihg men as cheerleaders ? like i am pretty sure that is a ting tehy're working on ."
11626,college footbal lhas male cheerleaders on the squads . i rememner seeing them at a university of iowa game . i also hear that their visito5s lockdr room was pink .
11627,"lol , that is funny , ya i saw that is in ipwa's away team locker room , i'm frankly hocked the team wasn't arrested for intoelrance o rgender discrimination given today's overreactions andx political climate"
11628,i think political correctness has glne too far lately .
11629,"ya now that sounds like a complete opposite of today , waht is shoking to me is that there is only about 11 mims of actual live gajeplay during an average football game , seems lik ethat i slow"
11630,"and most of that is hang time for punts ! lots of surprising trivia abou football . did you know patriots running back , greenellis , has neer fumbler the ball ? i wonder if he still plays for the pats and if so , if he will play this wweekend ."
11631,"i didn ot know that , i hope that the pats win the superbowl again this year ,l tom brady is a great american"
11632,"well , i hope he stays healthy and can play a few more seasons . i'm sure he needs the cash an average lifetime earnings for an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnngs fora n nf. player . and brady has a model wife he has to feed !"
11633,haha that ist ru4 ! i did read that his wife actually kakesm ore money then he does . i don't know what she does but i found that to be really wild !
11634,i hopde the score of the supebrowl gam3e is high . not as hjgh as thaf historic 2220 georgia tech romp over cumberland !
11635,"that is true that's ac razy score ! i think once it hi t010 to 0 , i would just turn teh game of and kno wwhich side was the winning team haha"
11636,"but if you turned the tv off , you woul miss thpse emmy award winning virtua lyellow liens espn puts on the field .t hat is worth the price of admission !"
11637,yesa nd i'd also misst he mqale cheerleads ! wua twould i ever do without both those things ! haga
11638,hey ! do you like football ?
11639,i sured po . did you know u of iowa painted teh visitor kocekr room pink ?
11640,really ? that is too funny ! i bet the visitors love that ! do you likse the cowboys football team at all ?
11641,"to be honest i do not hafve a favlorite team , just enjoy watching the games"
11642,"oh , i am the same wqay . i was reading an article about the cowboys player dak prescott adn his stance on protests during a fcootabll games national anthem . he says he feels at peace at gaems and won't pfotest with some other players , p5retty interesting ."
11643,i see that is intdresting . did you know thatb owlers used to amke more than football players in the 06s ?
11644,"they did ?; that is odd lop , you would never thin that ! just like i couldn't believe the football game tht was won with a score of 2220 that had to be a crazy game !"
11645,"i ,now georgja tehc made histo5y by beating cumberland back in 1916"
11646,"exactly ! i like the fact tha the nfl has no written rules against a female becomign a player , as long as they meet all eligibility requirements . i wonder i fthere has evr been a female football player ."
11647,i wonder too . and i mean there are only 11 minutes of game plqay so maybe it is not that bad after all
11648,"true , but i wouldn't want to get tackled by a 250 pound man either lol , players can get as many as 6 0hits per game . . . . no way lol , that's a lot . i would rather be n engineer and make morem oney than an nfl player does lol ."
11649,yeah i guess it makes more sense sicne engineers gave longer careers a well
11650,"yep , but they keep their body and brain intact for sure . football is a rou8gh sport . i wouldn't even want to eb a saints nfl cheerleader , they can't even eat at the same restaurant as the players . . ."
11651,yes and thd worst part is that they are required to leave mid meal oo if gthe players walk in
11652,"that is a ridiculous rule , i wonder if that is still true or if the nfl has hcanged that rule . i hopes o ."
11653,i hope so too because otherise it is just so sexist and wrong
11654,"i definitely agree . i think the nfl is probably better at treating teh cheerleaders better tha nthat in current times . they need to concentrate on keepin gtrack of the players skills by using the tracking chips in their shoulder pads , and in the cfootball ."
11655,i know . mayeb they can use the info to maket he game safer
11656,sexactly ! anything to make football safer is a good thing !
11657,yea . on another topic do you know much about presidents ?
11658,"i don't really . i just do my duty and vote for whoever i think is best for our co7ntry , that'es about it . i care but politics gvets zo crazy ."
11659,i know too muxh sometime s. nice chatting with you
11660,do you wathcf ootblal ?
11661,ye si do . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
11662,i wonder if it is supposed to have some effect on the players
11663,"i wonxer too . bowledrs used to mak emore than football p,ayers i nthe 60s"
11664,true . do you know what tfh ehighest score inc ollege football is ?
11665,"yes t is georgoat ech verus cumberland , 2220"
11666,yeah pretty big for a game in 1916
11667,yeah i know . did you know espn won an emmy ?
11668,yes they won it for the superimposed yellow line
11669,yes i amg ald they did because makes watching hte game on tv easier
11670,true . did 7ou know thza twomen can play in the nfl too ?
11671,yes if they qualify and meet the requirements of the game
11672,yeah . the average game is only 11m inutes of active participationb
11673,yes and we are yet glued to the tv for hours to an end
11674,true . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheereladers ?
11675,yea about them not being able to eat in the same place as the players .
11676,yeh that is so sexist and reallyh as to go ny now
11677,i know and the worst is that they have to leave mid meal too if they walk in
11678,yeah true . do you now much about the presidents ?
11679,i sure do . do you know who teh top three wealthiest ones are ?
11680,"yes that us wahington , jfk and jefferson"
11681,do you know who emily dickson ia ?
11682,"emily dickinson ? the poet ? i do ! ' tlel all the truth , but tell it slant ' she once said . do you like her poetry ?"
11683,yeah she was an icon she ied in 1886 at tbe tender age of 55 .
11684,"htough she was reclusive , she lived an interesting 55 years . do you know mch about her life ?"
11685,i did not unfortunately ! i hear over the years she shared at leasr 250 poems with susan he rclose friend before ma5rying austin .
11686,"ye . she wrote hundreds and hundreds of poems , but they were locked away on a drqwer , and a critic said that there wete many arresting phrases , nothing scanned or rhymed properly , and so he declinedt oh elp get htem published ."
11687,did you kow theres a poem when read normally is depressing bu twhen read backward is uplifting ?
11688,"wlw ! that is certainly different than emily's poetry . there's suhc a diversity in poetry . it's n surprise ,s ince poetry dates back to prehistorical times . died you know some of the first poetry was hynting poetry in africa ;"
11689,"ys and and extfensively throughout the history of the empire of 6the nile , niger and volta river valleys ."
11690,"yes . some of the earliest writte npoetry in africa is found among pyramid texts , written durign hte 25th cetjury , bce ! of course , poetry spread thro8ghout the worle , too ."
11691,"wo wi did not know tha t. edgar aolen poe received 9 . 00 for the raven , cn you believe that ?"
11692,"just 9 ? you know , ar , music , and poetry were onmce olympi csports ? can you imagine edga5 allen poe as an olympian ?"
11693,i can not but the fact that those parts of our ulture use to be in the olympicx is amazing . they should bring that back .
11694,"yes , poetry does see mto have lost some respect . in the past , the vikings were war5iorpoete , and poetry was considered a gift from odin himself ."
11695,now that's interesting . homers odyssey was one of my favorites .
11696,"ah yes !q uite an epic , isn't it ? and hojer wrote the iliad , as well ."
11697,"bringin back so many memories , i think i might listen to that soon .; demetri martin wrote a 224 word pawlindrome poem ."
11698,"funny ! you really can dos o much witg poetry ! there's also a poem that's 274 lines , andf eatures about 800 irregularly pronounced english words . its' called the chaos . i'd like hear that one resd out loud !"
11699,yeah that seemjs like the right name for it . do you lisen to or play the piano ?
11700,funny yo7 should ask ! i was just goin to wsk if you knew tha5t they used to call typewriter s' literary pianos ' ! isn't that funny ? i like to bang oh the keyboard every nw and hten ! wha about you ?
11701,"that's all i do is bang on them while missing the keys i'm aimking for , lol ! nice chatting with you ."
11702,good thing you're not plying on an old steam piano ! they'd hear you for miles around ! oodbye !
11703,"well maybe not on mars , haah , goodbye ;"
11704,did you know ther ichest superhero is black panther ?
11705,"is that the character in the 2018 film , or the acto4 who played the role ?"
11706,i think it i sthe character . i will check closer .
11707,okay . have you seen tg film ? heard it was nominated for oscars . . .
11708,i haven't yet but i plan to .
11709,"m e, too l. understand that symbols and script were based on 4th century nigerian story . costume designer win an oscar , i think . . . deserved to , at east . . ."
11710,interesting . costume designing would be a fun occypation .
11711,"agree . one young stwar in the film , chadwick boseman , was sponsored to an oxford , england theater program by a ' privat ebenefactor ' . turned out to be he great acto r, denzel washington . fun fact ?"
11712,wow ! that is interesting .
11713,"glad script made lbzack panther5 richest superhero , over characters ike tony stark , iron man , and hruce wayne , batman , . why not ? ?"
11714,true ! if you want a superhero make him really rich .
11715,"and o fnoble ancestry ! this early allblack film is possibly teh biggest performance wrk to come apong since vgershwin's blavk folk opera , porgy and bess . that was produjced in the 1940's ! about time ? ?"
11716,tha'ts amazing .
11717,"ues .d isney satudios owes something to the black community , too . in the 50's , disney did a really prejudiced film about blacks called ' song of the south ' . ever see it ? ?"
11718,there were so many acists showe baxck in the day . never saw that one .
11719,"true ! ! you didn't miss anything . amrvel comics caracter was not named after the7 0' sblack panhter party , though studio almost called film , blavk leopard ."
11720,that doesn't sound as scary .
11721,"you're rihgt ! don't think there are black leopards , are there . ?"
11722,lol i don't know . you wouldn't be able to see their spot s.
11723,"true . have a ' panther ' of sorts in my own house , snuggled by my feet at the moment . american shorthair wit5h tiger striope sahd leopardyellowe yes . about 5 months old . . . do you like cats ?"
11724,i like all animals . i dog sit a lot lately . it was nuce chatting wit hyou . i hope you have a bice day .
11725,what arts do youe njoy ? music ? poetry ?
11726,"hi there . i was an englieh major in college , so even though i took a lot of literature classes , i appreciate poetry , too . what about you ?"
11727,i took some poetry in high scholl and i still rmeemberl earning abojt plaindromes
11728,did you know that the comedian demetri martin wrote a 224word palindrome poem ? that's a lot of thinking and reading backwards !
11729,i can't evem begin to comprehend how it would go
11730,"there is also a poem that when read normally is depressin g, but when read backwards is inspiring l. i thinlk that's i8mpressiv4 , as well ."
11731,i think that in itself is pretty inspiring
11732,"yew , some works of poetry like the epic of gilgamesh are pretty , well , epic , for lac kof a better word gaha . they try to take you to another time and place ."
11733,it is pretty amazing how literarure allows us to build worlds within our minds
11734,"speaking of other worlds , isn't it crazy how much we've learned about mars , to the point where there's a colonization project planned for 2023 ?"
11735,didn't the pla to colonize mars recently get cnaceled ?
11736,"apparen5tly this colonization is being funded by a feality tv show , although wyo knows igf it is actually a iable idea . science and entertainment aren't always the best marriage ."
11737,"i mean when a single mistake can kill you , id on't think a reality tv show environment is conducive either"
11738,it's really one of thel ower forms of entertainmentsdefinitely not up there with classical piano and such elevated forms o fartistic expression . do you like piano music ?
11739,"i wonder if linchens and cyanobactera were plated on mars gy people , would they evolve into newl ife forms ?"
11740,i bet the amount of time it would ake for that would be lomger than life on earth would be around to observe it haha .
11741,perhaps . i hope when they colonize3 mars they would at least bring alonbg a piano
11742,"yes , although it it a luxury item that would probbaly increase the payload too much t e practical . also , due to atmospheric differences , the sounds it creates would have a higher pitch on mars ."
11743,perahps tehy would mak4e it somehow there ? i mean peopel a piano on the highes tmountain peak in teh uk .
11744,"the british can be pretty crazy . on april 18 , 1930 , the bbc broadcas piano mjsic because they decided there was no neww worth reporting ."
11745,i wouldn' ay that is crazy . piano music is just that good . it has actually been used to de5er crime successfully in public spaces
11746,"that's interestig . they've had about 300 years 6o perfect it since it was invented in italy around 17o0 , so i hope it would be good !"
11747,"indeed . in any case , thank you for the pleasant chat . hope you have a wonderful day ."
11748,are you familiar with summit meetings ?
11749,"hello ! i know a little , how about you ?"
11750,ih ave a passing knowledge that they are meetings for international heads of state or government to discuss important topics and perhaps come to a mutually good agreement
11751,"yes , it is very important , the term summit wa snot used until the geneva summit back in 1955 , afte rthe cold war era the number of sumiit events increased ."
11752,"they can alao be very passive aggressive as when the canadian prime minister said ' i guess i will shak4 y0ur hand , but i onky have one thing to say . you need to get out of ukraine . '"
11753,"wow , i read that during a g20 summit , russia gave eads of state thumb drives and phones chargers that had trojan viruses to picj up their computer and phon edata , that's pretty crazy !"
11754,i wonder if ther3e were any real consequences when they were fouhd out
11755,"i don't know but i would think that would cause a lot of problems to say the least . like back in 2007 an austrailian satire group impersonated tghe canadans and entered a secure zone otf an apec of wor.d leaders . . . they 2ere only caught wehn one man was dressed as osaam bin laden ,"
11756,"i understand they are doing something importnt , but i feel that sometimes what they are doing isn't as important like awarding eve onlijne a world suymmit a2ard for s content and creativity . recongition for the crewtors o tfhe gme is nice , but you woudl think they hav ebigger fish to fry"
11757,"right ? i ould think the same thing ! i was reading about an olympic gold medalist getting a breast cancer diagnosis , she had reached the summit of the sport which she was a us pioneer . she won the 1st medal in cross country ski9ing for the us , do you watch the olympics ?"
11758,. i watch it as well as the fifa world cup
11759,"it is just sad she went from winning s gold medla and only 2 montns into retirement . . . and gets suc ha bad diagnosis . she says she will beat it though , great frame o fmind . yes , fifa ia the most widely viewed and followed sport event in 5he world . the american team gas never placed below 3rd since 1991 in yhe woemn's wo5rld cup ."
11760,i'm excited for the world up in qatar in 2022 despite teh city not yet existing
11761,"i hearf that ! i wonder how that is supposed to work lol , an non existing city . . . . bu definitely excitinv ! 17 countries have hosted th eworld cup , pretty awesome 1q"
11762,"i guess despite not net economic gains forh osting they do get benefits like prestige , recognition , and tourism that make it work investing in a hjgh tehc new city"
11763,"exactly ,l geting that ,any people in one place is surely good for the economy ."
11764,i think buildng the city would also generate jobs
11765,"right , and that is something thst is needed . i like itr that the us got 3rd place in the first fifa back in 1930 ."
11766,"indeed , givej the us's impressive track record of always impressive at least 3rd since 1991 , i am lookinh forward to their performance in yhe next world cup . in any case , i thank you for the pleasing chat ."
11767,exactly . thank you so much ift has been nice !
11768,to you as well . have a nice day .
11769,do you watch soccer ?

11780,"hmm do not know but know h6at he once promoted shoe sfor free , and they cost 15 each pair . sow hy ?"
11781,"wow , he did to romote homelessness . what a guy"
11782,did you know ballt dancer go through 4 pairs of shoss in a single we3ek ?
11783,yes lots of shoes . did you know 5000 year old shoes are better than they are now ?
11784,"yeqh that is pretty interesting , they need to crack tha tsecret"
11785,fight ? do you know how to keep your shoes smelling good ?
11786,"yes you can use tea bags , and it works superw ell"
11787,yeah they do . did you know in fashion shoes are sometimes just a decoration ?
11788,"s5trangeb ut ok , . there are so many designs though based oj culture alone"
11789,yes that is true amnd that detemrines if they have heelds or not as well
11790,"hello , do you like soccer ?"
11791,yes . i sometimes warcht he fifa world cup .
11792,nice . do you know that in 2022 will be held in qatar but no one knows the nme of the city ?
11793,"wow , i feel for those taht have to print stuff for it . i didn't ralize the u . s . got 3rd place in the first fifa world cup in 1930 ."
11794,yeay but they have not d0ne great since then . women' team has done great thoubh
11795,i'm surprised that there are no economc gains for countries that host the world cup .
11796,yes they keep doing it . go figure . hungary did pretty well between 1950 and 1596 its eems
11797,i wonderh ow spain does . the are the only country that's a permanent guest at the g20 summit .
11798,yeah that one is interesting why they keep doing that . have you heard of eveonline game ?
11799,no . have you ever heard of using dry tea bag sto abxorb odors in shoes o5r gym babs '
11800,"yeah i actually ue them sometimes , it does indeed keep them very fresh an dsmelling good ."
11801,i'll have to try that . i' also like ti try the 5000 year old shoes that are supposed to perfor better tha nmodern shoes .
11802,yeah i wonder if anyone cracked that secret . htey might work better for ballet dancers w3ho go through 4 pairs in a week
11803,i'm sure nike is on it . wouldn't you be suspicious if russia gave you a thumb drive at the g20 summit ?
11804,yeah i guess xo . did youk now in 2007 an australian satire group impersonated the canadian motorcade and entered the summit ?
11805,"ha , that'sf unny . was it bob and doug mckenzie ?"
11806,i have no idea what their names were but do you know how they got caught ?
11807,someone was fressed like bin laden . i bet some sdecurituy staff peopek got fired .
11808,tyeah that musth ave been strange . do you know the nvl wider eceiver steve smith ?
11809,no . i wonder if he took ballet and went through 4 pa8rs of pointe shoes a week . some nlf players have to take ballet .
11810,he actuall7 left his celats in the field to raise awarenese about homelessness . nice chat
11811,did you know that pianos were invented around 1700 by an italian ?
11812,"i did not , who was the personw ho invented them ? piano does sound italian though i suppose"
11813,he as named bartolomeo cristofori . i agree that he couldnt' have picked a more italiann ame for his invention . can you guess who used the saem piano as paul ccartney when he recorded he7 jude ?
11814,i would guess it would be freddie nercry in that case ?
11815,you are right my friend . when he recorded bohemian rhapsody .t wo very epic songs
11816,"it sure was an 4pic two songs , pianos make everything better too , sk melodic"
11817,"they do . i wished i played piano . i should know how , my pa5ents had one , but i never took the time to leadn it . . ."
11818,did you ever hear about the climbers who climbed a mountain and fo7nd a poano on the top ?
11819,"yes , i believe in was in 2006 in britain , not any mountain , but the highest on e. how could yhat hqppen ?"
11820,"i am not sure , someone must have been playing a joke or sonmething , se a helicopter or something"
11821,"pianos are very heavy , i have a hard time believing even an helicopter fould pll somethin goff like this , but you are right , there's no other logical explantion ."
11822,"we may never know i guess . maybe they used a private jet , lime arnodl schwarzenegger does"
11823,"yeah . the exgovernor of california who keep sayingt aht engironment is important , yet hd commuted to wodrk by private plane everycday ."
11824,"i guess if its 3 hours by jet , it would be a very long drive , but still , just move"
11825,exactly . you can't tell pedople to save the planet while you're olluting it by the worst transport mode possible . it's mot like hec an't afford a second home closer to wor k.
11826,"to each their own i guess , g9vernors let powe rget to their heaed sxometimes . like when the north dakota governor seceded from america"
11827,"some do some good though , like ralph lawrence carr who rrefused th einternmbet of japaneseamericans during the second world war ."
11828,taht is an awesome thing to do . i think that is on eof the darkest parys of ww2 personally
11829,"on our side of the 3orld , ye4s , but it wwsn't much better int heswe nazi camps . . ? ."
11830,"that is for sure , that is just a drk time in history , before the ease of accessing information"
11831,"hopefully , the fact that now internet allows you to chat with stranger and exchange information will prevent thia from happejing again . have a great day ."
11832,"that is true , it make sit a lot harder to hide injustices . thank yhou , you as wlel !"
11833,"hi , howa re you ?"
11834,"good , thanks , how are you ?"
11835,"i ma well , thanks . do you play any instruments ?"
11836,i used to play the 0piano and flute but haen't i na while . how about you ? dd you know that there is a pioano at the fop of vritain's highest mountain ? it was discovered i n2006 .
11837,"wow . who put it thdere ? in 1930 , the bbch ad no worthy news so they just broadcast piano music . seem slogical !"
11838,"hmm , i do't know if people know who put it there . no idea how it got there without people noticing . ha . there was also a pisno on the airship hindenburg . it weight 356 pounds , light for a piano !"
11839,who has the strength or will to drag a piano up there ? that is oight for a piano . i wounder what it sounds like ?
11840,"hmm , perhap sit was a team of people . seemsp ike n awesome place to play though . have you heard of the song circus galo9p ? that song is for stress testing auto pianos . humawns cannot play kit ."
11841,i had no idea . im on spotify and will have to check it ou t. there's one piano that can crank out hits though . it was used for hey jude and bohemia nrhapsody .
11842,nice ! my parents actually bribed me to take piano lessons by saying i could take horseback riding lessons as well . did you know that two hiyh schol studentsr ode fheir horses to school on no vehicles day and got xuspended ? uhaha .
11843,what ? thzt seems lik3e such a great idea ! why no5 reward their ingenuity ?
11844,"rihgt ? i'dr eally like to ride an icelandic horse . they have a fifth speed , a tolt . it's like speedwalking !"
11845,"haha ! i am picturing a speed wslking horse , the the speed wlakers from the olympics . with beadbands and awristbands . . ."
11846,that is a hilariou spicture ! lipizzaner horses seem pretty cool too . they are born glack or brown and tehn turn compeltely white after about 6 years .
11847,probbaly the stress from raising af amily .
11848,"ha , funny . have you watched movies with clint eastwood on horseback ? apparently there are many . clint eastwood actually ha da mid life alergy to horses ."
11849,"i have not . now tha ti thiink about it , i have not seen manyc lint eastwood movies . . . gran tourino masy be the only one ."
11850,"yea h, they wete mostly movie smade a long time ago . spaking of things from history , even furtehr bfore that dalmatians were associated withf irefighters because they would calm and protect the horses , for the horse and carriages that firefighters usedb ack then ."
11851,i wa sjust wondering about taht the other day . thanks for sharing that !
11852,"eure , i think dalmatians are still really cool dogs !"
11853,nic ehatt9ng with you !
11854,do you enjoy muasic ?
11855,"i love music , i especially enjoy clazsical music where the piano shines through and you can hear the relaximng sounfs of the strings being struck by hammers . do you ?"
11856,"i agree , the piano is a wonderful instrumet producing what is arguable the most beautiful of sounds"
11857,"lady gaga , freddie mercury all play piano b7ut mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody that paul mccartney used to record hey jude k both amazingb songs ."
11858,really ? what piano is this ? must be fajous if so mnay amazin gpeople used it
11859,"exactly ! though i don't think it's the same piano that was found at the top of brita9n'sh ighest mountain , i'd imagine thse strings and sounds would be frozen ."
11860,"in any case , you hav eto respect cristofori fof making such a complex , yet beautifully sounding instrument so long agp in the 1700s"
11861,"is taht who invnted the piano , not familiar witj who cristofori is ."
11862,ya bartolomeo cristofori xreated the acoustic piano in italy severasl centries ago . i wonder how he got the idea to make such a instruemnt
11863,"i see m, tjsanks for clarifying , he is a genius . i wondewr ho whe would feel to know that some one created an aluminum gran dpiano to put into the lounge of a spaceship and weighs only 356 pounds !"
11864,i woner if it being aluhminum gave 5he pianoa ny other special quality in regard to sound
11865,"i'm thinking itw ould sound like chimes , a bit more soothing perhaps it s probably just as soothing as thes ong composwd solely by stress testing auto pianos id ."
11866,i don't think aluminum would survive the circus glaop for some reason . i feel liek the metal will b3nd
11867,"that's a good point . i was surprised to see that texas elected their first female gkvernor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment , it would seem to md that tecxas was a more conservative state ."
11868,it is a shame suc people didn't have ore sway . there were apso a person called ralph carr who was the only govenror who opposedt he internment of japanese aemricans in wwii
11869,"wow , just one person , i'd actulaly like to know how mwny people felt the same way but was afraid to speak up for fear of being critiized aw 'unpastriotic 'or something ."
11870,i mea nbeing unpatriot9c is being like north dakota's governor who declared martial law and seceded from the us back in 1934
11871,was the secession successfu lbakc thne ? i don't recall whether or not any states actually seceded back then ?
11872,"eh trued , but what mattwrs now is that we are one country . not the us and nor6h dakota"
11873,"i agree and that was emphasized by the beatles song ' vome together ' ,m luckily they had som uch sway and power for th public to embrwce the united we stand mentality ."
11874,"i totally agree . inh any case , thajnk you for this enjoyable chat ."
11875,are you a marvel comics fan ?
11876,"hyes , i am ."
11877,i did not know that the supe rhero thing has been arounrd since the 1930's . did you ?
11878,"no . i knew most of the mwete from comics from many years ago , but i did not know they were from the 30s . i did notk now that theh had kept spiderman and not all tghe characters . they are all so integral to marvel ."
11879,i had no idea tat seuperhroes are registered and that there are over 200 !
11880,"me neither ! i love thqtm arvel was able to successfully argue that mutnats are not people . pretty cool information . i also love how they make up some heroes for their fazns , like blueear"
11881,i ave not seen all pf the movies but i did see infinity war . i thought the avengerfs were very cool !
11882,"i nave seen every single movie from marvel and some from dc . i feel like if you haven ot seen enough amrvel movies then it is hard to connect with the characters 9n yhe level that infinity wars demanded . as the characters vanised , i tbroke my heart ."
11883,omg ! i bet it did q you are a fan ! i find it interesting that lou ferrigno hasb een involved since hte 1970s as the hulk .
11884,"yes , i am a huge fan of marvel . i was also a child when lou ferrigno had thet v series . i dix not know tha tarvis , th evoice actor , has not sen the films . i think that is kind of disyraceful ?"
11885,aww that is . i also think that i have heard interviews on npr by stan lee . i know he invented a bunch of comic book heroes for marvel .
11886,"stan lee was quitre bri;liant in his creatjon and handling of marvle . it's a shame he recently passed . it hink the thing i loved most about infinity wars , avengers , and others like it ma re tnhatt hey had so many superheros in it at once . i6 gave the film so many opportumities to explore different story lines rtc ."
11887,i find it fascinating that there was a series about fixing te dajmage caused by super heroes .
11888,"i agree , it makes sense though as they cause a lot of damage . lol i like that there was a spinofft o garcfield about a s8uperhero . that's pretty neat ."
11889,i think that is so cool . the creator oc garfield went to ball state and my sister babysa tfor him . i like that garfield and his friends were all super heroes .
11890,"wow , that is amazing ! my cousin does comicons and makes his own costumes . he has won awards for his ironman and transformers"
11891,th ecact that normal man was a reverse hero on a super ehro plaent is creative !
11892,i agree . i also love guardians of the galaxy . groot ia my favoriter . it hurt to see him disappear .
11893,i did not know that disney can not use the big marvel characters in its theme parks . i have been to the spiderman rid ein unibersa studios .
11894,"o need to look up access , as i did not know that this character exised , so i guess i do not know about all marvel thigns ."
11895,ih ad never heard of access andt hey think it 9s to keep the two companies separate ! how confusing !
11896,i agree . funny how much legal sytuff there are between them . 5heuy should just join forces .
11897,tyat would definitely eb like disney combining with universal . i like that the marvel comics began in 1961 .
11898,me too . it' sbeen great talking to you . have a great day .

11923,"wow , they would have made aw ton of ,oney ahd they taken the deal . jad i am ok , tank you ."
11924,heres anothedr fun faqct ! marvel successfully argued in court that mutwnts are not people and thus got to pay the lower rate on xmen ' toys ' instead of the higher rate for dolls because the are not humna .
11925,i guess people wkll argue ober anything if it ionvolves oney . did you know michael jackson tried to buy marvwl comics a tone point ?

11971,"whoa cool . the people who work at amazon are important too , and can walk betwween 7 and 15 miles each day ! fulfilling orders i assume ."
11972,"thats a good way to stay healthy , imdb is also a company owned by amazon"
11973,really ? they have a lot of powerful friend s. teh usps is also contracted with them to deliver on sunday even !

11980,"oh tahnks , i will be carefull , maybe not get my supplements from target ora ny of those places"
11981,"yeah i wonder where woul dbe a better plaqce to huy ? 3el lig you ,iket arget it would be best not to live in vermont ! they don't have one there !"
11982,"it must be the only state , target is really popular and theres a store almost everywhere"
11983,yeah i agree . i also lijet he store because they don't carry tobacco products ! health conscious of them gor sure .

11990,"i think music has been around almost forever but yeah i think taht soundws about right , maybe with royalty it got exploited and a bit more appriciated"
11991,"i hlpe so . allpeople can appreciate music . i think that there is sometnhing in there for everyon e, rich , poor , educated or no ."
11992,"i agree with you , youk now a shiopping center in australia actually uses classical music to stop teenagrrs from loitering i woner how that works"
11993,clssical music is totally uncool dude . the kids hate it ! lol there is also the ' m9squito ' for getting rid of teenagers .
11994,"you have a great point lol , i tlooks like classical music also stops crime and vandalism"
11995,"yes , i bet it can be used to get rid of gangs in certaib areas . maybe they ciuld play pop m8sic nad rap and hip hop to draw them into other areas ."
11996,"in fac tusing classical music resulted in 33 percent fewer robberies , 25 percent less assaults , percent 37 less vandalisma and all of this in a time period of 18 months"
11997,that is an amazing statistic . i wonder i fit could be broadcast all of the tough 0arts of chicago and la . the enwuing calm would be unreql .
11998,"maybe it canw okr , theres nothing to lose with trying i heqrd a compyter composd a iece of classic music back in 2011"
11999,"we could have ai come up wiht different musc , figure ou twhich us the most effective at crime prevention , blast it around the planet . presto !"

12007,hello . i love classica music concerts . do you ?
12008,"i do ? especiall,y the opera silent night by kevin puts"
12009,arthur lintgen is amazong one how he can identify a piece of classical music by simply analyzing the grooves on a vinyl record .
12010,"amazing . sadly , not mabny people use vinyl records naymore . speaking of classical music , did you know that heav6y metal fans and classical music fans often have similar personaliies ?"
12011,i did not know that . i would have love to hear teh computer composed piece of contejporary claswical music .
12012,i wonder if it would sound a lot nor estatic compared to tregular musi c. i was surprised a whole time periodw as named the classical period .
12013,do you like movies ? disney's ' treasure plnaet ' flopped but i liked it

12038,"really ? i htought itw as just wibngs . . . in 2011 a computer composed a piece of contemporary classical music ,"
12039,"technology is amazing with that . classical music is useful like you say too , some cities actually have used it to play n publics paces and deter crime ."
12040,"that funny , like bill murray . he hinks kung fu hustle is ' the supreme zchievemnet of the modern age in terms of comedy ' ."

12047,"i am ! monty py6hon was one of m6 favoritef ilsm , one of th eaxtors , graham chapman , was actua.ly a doctor originally ."
12048,nice chatting with you l.
12049,hjey did you know that disney had thought about closing down after sleeping beauty didn't make a lot of moeny in theqters ?
12050,"that is surprising . it may have not been a big earner , but it showed they had artistic talent . they furhter refined the args and had some seriousm oneymakers later ."
12051,"yes , imagine the loss if they had closed that early , but they have had a lot of flops like the movie treasure planet , definitely one of the biggest flops of all time , that movie was ok but nothing special"
12052,did you know tom hanks us related to walt dinsey . so it runs ibn the family ! he is a real earner wit h8 . 5 billion in box offices ale .
12053,"wokw didn't know that 2 6hat's a lot of money ! bill murray is a good actor , he loves th emovie kung fu hustle , have you seen it ?"
12054,"i have not . bill has had a lot of comedic success on the big screen . on the small screen , i ws a big fan of 3rd rock from the sun ."
12055,"ya i guess 3rd rock won a golden vglobe , i've never seen that sh0w , but it beat seinfsld and frasier whicha re shows that i do like"
12056,"living in a rural area , we have limited accesas 6o live arts . so , i get a lot of my performance arts from pbs . have you seen te opera ' silent night ' ?"
12057,"i haven't , i do like opera though adn i like classical music , which aparnetly if played in public can rexuce thec ase of robberies and assault haha"
12058,"i suppose clqssicla music is n0t a genrf avored by thugs . i have beent o only one classical music concert in dc . th4y calim audiecnes can be wild and moving , but my experience was that it was very wuiet and subdued ."
12059,"ya it ahs an effect on people , in austrailia they play it in malls to stop kids fro mloitering too haha"
12060,ic ould see jit drive out the mall rats ! ! ! that 2ould make shopping a more pleasant experience . i hope the silent night opera makes it to the big screen or pbs . i ti san intewresting juxtaposition 9f an 1918 song 9n the 1914 ww1 armistice .
12061,"yz i'll have to check that out , what i scrazy is in 2011 a computer composed a brand n4w classical music song , ai is getting so advanced !"
12062,"i guess ai can compose , but does it have ' soul ' and ' feeling ' ? ai is getting better , but will i tevery truly master human emotion ? could ai have composes silent night without have hujman emotion or experience ?"
12063,"thyqat's a good question , we will have to see , i want to see tb eai htat can identify classical music just fom vinl records like arthur lintgen apparently can"
12064,"taht is unbelievablw ! i would find it hard to believe that ai could accomplish a feat such as turning silent nighr into an opera . even wity encyclopwedic knowledge of ww1 , i doubt it could capture the emotions of soldiers from three warring nations temporarily laying down their arms for christmas ."
12065,"speaking of wwi , have you seen the nw peter jackson documentaryt on it ? it's called they will not grow old , it's actulaly really good he colorized old wi fiotage and has interviews in it , i'd highly recommend it"
12066,i will look taht up . why do you think that ilent nigth composers wanted to commemorate armistice day that occurred more than a century ago ?
12067,"i don't know , i know that they wanted to celebrate the peace , but i can only imagine , it is crazy that wwi was ovee 100 yearsa go and everyone from that war has passed on"
12068,"i wonder myself considering the conflicts ongoing today . apparently fro a reviewer's perspective ht eopera was not that good . vut , with audiences , ita a hit with shows in multipoe venues ."
12069,well k will hqave to check that out and you should definitely check out that documentary i recommended !
12070,"i just learned that jeff bezos built a clock in a moujtain , that wll run for 10 , 00 years . one would think he would findc something else to spend his time snd money on ."
12071,9 agree . i can only imagine how much he spent on that . did you see thzat the first amazon customer got a building named afer him ?
12072,"that is so crazy ! i never knew best uy would price match amazon , i knew target did , which you dcannot fjnd in vermont ."
12073,"that's interestijng ! i onder thatv ermont doesn't have one . i didn't reqlize how targst got it's start so many years ayo in 1902 , priginallu ."
12074,i never knew that either . weird that they haven't carried tobacco products since the 90's .
12075,yes it is . apparently the herbs that are advertised to be in most of tuhe supplements in several stoes don't contain hte ones they dvertise .
12076,"naughty naughty . one would th8nk these companies would take a pag eout of lego's book , and find environmentally friendly alternatives to oilbased plastices ."
12077,legos have been around for so long and continue to be popular . hte company is actially based in denmark .
12078,yep . many think they are abn american company . tuey've eben around since 1949 . htat's a long time .
12079,"i thought theyw ere an american company too ! just since juy 2015 , 600 billion lego parts have been made ."
12080,i think half of those are ij my huse . it's insane how amazon warehouse workers wlak ul to 15 miles a shift . that's hard work .
12081,"they must have to he in great shape ! did you know that lego brand is considered ,ore powerful then ferrari ?"
12082,"i did , and that lego gave out a 14k old brick to factory workers who had been there for over 25 years . that would be so cool to own ."
12083,it sure would . it sounfs likse the employees are taken care of well . they are valued at about 1500o . 00
12084,"have you been to one of their amusement parks ? legoland is always worth a visit , their stores are amazing , ad you can buy indicidual bricks ."
12085,"no i haven't , but it souds like fun ! so there are enough lego bricks for every person on earth to o3wn 86 of them ."
12086,i bet thede are at least double that in every home . especialy the yard . those things are everywhere .
12087,"ik no2 , they end up everywherea nd htey're are very painful to step on , h aha ! it would be beneficial if they can produce a more environmental material to use for all those legos ."
12088,"they are working on an alternative , i was surprised tgo fidn out they had a very lowd efective rate in the plqnt ."
12089,that is surprising ! did you see where a german graffiti artist painted a bridge that's 250 sq feet to look like a lego ? htat would be a sigh !
12090,i did . some interior decoryorsa re using accent pieces made of legos . mostl in white .
12091,interesting ! i enjoyed our conversation and got an education on several ckmpanies . have a great night !
12092,"thank you , you do the sa,e ."
12093,thanks !
12094,"hi , how are youse doing tonight ?"
12095,"nor bad , wha6 do you think about amazon ?"
12096,"maazon does well by itsc ustomers , but n9ot so good by its workers . do yoiuse use amazon ?"
12097,"yes . i have heard their warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 miles a day , hat's pretty crazy ."
12098,i guess the workers must be fit . the first ustomer got a building named after thsm . that must be a strange honor .
12099,yeah it had to have been a book ecause amazon started ouy as a online biokstore . i wonbder what book the person bought ?
12100,"they probably boughtj eff bezos autobiography . the man has a clock that will run for 10 , 000 years !"
12101,"haha i hope it runs better than my kindel , i had to replace one after 2 weeks but amazon snt me a new one and gave me3 z frre book of my choice so that was nice ."
12102,tha'ts great ! they love their customers ! i don't know about thw wokrers though . they truck a deal with united states postal se5vice to deliver package son sunday
12103,"well tehy are certanly better than target , even though target is the 8th largest department store in the us ."
12104,and yet vermont is the only state in the uza to not have a target store . isn' tthzt bernie sanders home state ? hernie ! what up ? !
12105,"yeah , they say they will price match zmazon but i'll believe it when i see it ."
12106,i ain't never tried that ! i bet amazon will doa nything to beat a competitor !
12107,"well th3y are second in the world in total sa,es after the alibaba group . they are the largest internet retailer in the wolrd by a decent margin i think ."
12108,plus they own imdb . since 1998 . soon they will own everything .
12109,well it takes somethinh specisl to have the usps deliver on sundays that's for sure !
12110,i think they must get time snd a half or double time or something . those guys do not work on sudnays !
12111,"no kiddign , amazon has gotten so big now , they have their own film and televiusiom studio . iw atched thej ack ryna show , it was pretty good ."
12112,"tat was good . i think they got a good shot at getting some awards . anyho2 , great chatting with youse tonight . i wish you fhe best !"
12113,you too avoid tzarget !
12114,i will ! i'll move to vermont !
12115,haha take care !
12116,"i think the classicsa re a sure bet , what are your thoughs on this ?"
12117,"i tuink the classics are a god start if it is measured . with a growing gen x income and nostzlgia , te classics are a good strrt but thrre jas to be new stuff too to ceate the milleniasl with a future ' classic ' toy they can buy too ."
12118,"i agree , there must always be innovatipn , its great how we have access to digital versionhs of book on kingle know ."
12119,yeah . i am trying to go all digitla with my books bit there's something about holding a book that tne kindle cant replicate . do you use a kindle ?
12120,"i do use kindle , what about you ? i got a fire tablet and been using it since the ."
12121,i had a fire tblet but now use the kindle app on my ipad . i lo eit . i may get a qhite paper kindle so i can travel with it .
12122,"i think tats a great choice , i heard it has a lpng batterylife so thats good , kind of like the clok jeff bezos built on a mountain ."
12123,"10 , 000 years ! gthat's a long time . i will never know if it lasts that long . . . did you know they wn the patnet on oneclicks hoppign ?"
12124,"i didnt know that was a thing that could be patented lol , and it sure is a long time , i guess we wont be alive to see if its tru e."
12125,apple paye amazon a usage fee vor the techhology . seem slikea mazon got it rivht . not sure how you can patent customer service but hey . . .
12126,"jeff bezos is sure talented adn smart , its more htan 20 yeqars and the company seems to have np limits ."
12127,not if he buys up companies like whole foods . i heard they are looking inyo openin tnew stores in sears buildigns sincw they closed .
12128,"i see , that would be a good way to reactivate economy , an interesting fact is how much warehouse workers have to walk ,"
12129,amazon walks like 715 . i worked in office mx warehouse an dwalked about the same . i was so ired after my shifts .
12130,"i can imagine , 71 5can be a lot but on the other side can be really healthgy ."
12131,i was so dizgusting after working in an unair codnitioned warehouse . not feesh !
12132,"i see , that can be unhealthy on the other hand , do you ever xhop at target ?"
12133,i do shop the4e . do you ?
12134,"i do ., i like that theuy will match the prize that amazon has , so no doubt im getting a good deal there ."

12139,i know we need to ask the mrussianjs how they came up with that
12140,"yeah , all the way back in 1936 too . crazy the way technology develops isn't it ?"
12141,of course . do you know why you should not smoke near an apple computer ?
12142,"i've heard it voids the warranty . i've neve rdone it , and i'm no 5sure how they'd know if you djd or not ."
12143,"exqactly , how would they know .a re you annoyed by insects ?"
12144,"all he tiome ! they are like the plague in florida , especially during the summer . how about you ?"
12145,i am not a an eithsr . have youh ear dof gold bugs ?
12146,"no , but they sound like thek ind of buy i could possible get ebhind . what do thet do ?"
12147,they breathe in dissolved gold and excrete solid gold

12150,are they those bugs that you always fimd in piles of bricks ?
12151,yes an din concrete as well
12152,"i wonder if thos eare the same bugs that are in car,ine , or red dy e4"
12153,i know they were using them in food dyes as wellq nd iy became a huge issue
12154,"the thought of eatinv b8ugs is pretty gross , bu i guess its not too harmful"

12160,i do . i like amazon but wish i had more will power not to buy as much .
12161,it does get easy to get out of contro lon there . did you know that the company was founded in 1994 ? i caj't believe it's been aroumd that long .
12162,"i know , right ? did you know that bezos is getting divorced and his wife and he married one year before he started amazon so she gets half !"
12163,"yes i did hear that . i'm sure he has a hand in that not working out . i thouhgt i heard he was unfaithful but i would have to verify that . for some reason he built a clock into a mountain that hould run for 10 , 090 years . i wonder why ?"
12164,"i thinbk he has a girl friend . the internet was bauzz about it but i wasn't interested enoughj to clic, on the stories . 8i would lik3 a building named after me , like their first customer . . ."
12165,ik yad hesard thqt th efirst customer has a building anmed after him . and he only spent 27 . 95 so that's a good deal .
12166,yeah ! their warehouse workers walk bet3een 7 and 15 miles a day . i used to work in a warehouse and you walk a lot !
12167,wow ! that's a huge warehouse . apparently usps has a contract with amazon to deliver their packages on sundays but i've never received a sumday delivery .
12168,i think i have but i am in chicago so taht might play a role in it .
12169,i'm sure itd efinitely does . 'm in ohio ut ij love chicago . it's an amazing town . i was unaware until recently that amazon owns imdb . i go there a lot als .
12170,i do too . esp3cially when i har cartoon voice i recognize but can't figure out . or refula actors tjat i cannot place .
12171,yes i use it all of hte time for the ' where i have i seen that person ' quesetion . do you use spotify ?
12172,i do listen to epotify . all the fime . you ?
12173,"i'm more of a pandora person but i do use it sometimes . it's crazy to me that an ar6ist has to get 130 , 745 plays per dy to eadn minimum wage on spotify ."
12174,that's a lot of p;lays ! ! q seedms like the artist got the short 4nd of the stick .
12175,"it does . but on the flip side a band once earned 20 , 000 on the app for a silent alnbum 3hicdh is mind blowing ."
12176,that is crazy ! i htibnk spotify just went public . . .
12177,i will have to look into that . i know they have 4 million songs so they should be around for a while and you'd think the stock would be a good investment .
12178,yeah . that and amazon ! nice chatting with you !
12179,you as well .
12180,"how's it going ? did you know spiders actually fall from the sky , that's terrifying"
12181,yewah . it is like the float . scary
12182,it's crazy that spiders can parachute on lng sgrands of webbing
12183,"i know , so creepy"
12184,i guess spisers used that method to move onto volcanic islands
12185,"that would be a lot of silk to get acros the ocean , but if they float , i guess ghat explains it ."
12186,"yea , charles darwin claims to of caught a spider that had traveled at least 60 miles"
12187,how would he have known ?
12188,apparently he was on a newly formed volcan9c ilsand an dwas able to identify the spider asa n aeronaut spider which aref ound far away from there
12189,ahh . i dont know why so many people are afraid of them .
12190,i don't know but much can be lerend about how they travel through the air which can lead to innovations jn negineering
12191,i didn't think of that . that would be a neat thing to study .
12192,"yea m spiders and insects can be pretty cool . spiders aren't the only ones who travel in the sky , ladybugs do too"
12193,"there are golf bugs , that breathe in diswsolved gold ajd excret esolid gold ."

12205,"that's crazy , so is apple voiding warranties fo rsmoking near theirc omputers"
12206,"yes , humans ca nhave weird rues , but there must be so9me scientific reasoning behind it . i mean , that's how we got computers and the int4rnet in the first placescientksts ."
12207,"yea , the world wide web was invented by an english scientidst working at cern"
12208,"yes , the internet was origvinally for sharing research data . the idea of a scientist is a pretty recent ideait wasn't a term until the 91tn century when williams whewell invented it in 1833 ."
12209,"that's interesting , plus scientists tend to be really smart at a young age . von neumann cohl divide two 8 digit number in his head wt 6"
12210,smart peopel tend to stay that wsay and remain curious throughout their lives . the emperkr of japan i strained as a scientist and continues to publish research today .

12215,"yea plus they transport themswelves through the sky , that's cray and a little scarfy"
12216,"i don't think they have the mental capacity to be scaredi mean , they can evene nd up as zkmbies like aldybugs who are infected by dinocampus coccinellae wasps ."
12217,"that's pretty scary , so is eating crushed up bugs with fold that contains red 4"

12303,"yes i agree . and that's why they clos3 down the linux access , because people were hacking it lol . htey just didn't think that stuff out very well . i think it is cool that the last game for the ;ps2 was fifa 14 , which spanned 3 console generations"

12356,"wellp , audiobooks were originlaly made for blind people . however , with advent or vehicles and mindless dribing , ,istening t audiobooks qre easy ."
12357,"yeah , even just at home it's nice too . reading paper literature is nice either artistic stories or intellectual information , but it can be a strain o nyour weyes ."
12358,"however , it's quicker to read a book than it is to listen to it . you can also take notes , i love postit notes . scifi books are great when i'm about to hit the hay . i love to reazd fanasy books ."
12359,"that is true , but i'm rarely in a rush . take harry potter which you've mentioned . it's probably the greatest fantasy book nad the audio boos are even better . jim dale performs 300 different voices , and he certainly sounds betyter then i do in my hewd ."

12366,ic an't get past icet as a rapper and tv celerbiyy . audiobook narration by him just makes me think about all the stuff h eplayed in .
12367,"i can see that , but he does such a good job . i hear he's really into spelling bee's too among other things . did you know there are fantasy drafts for the nationql spelling bee ? i bet t is into that ."
12368,lol . fantasy drafts of national spelling bees ? i could see thqt . such a baller .
12369,people will bet on anyhting . i prefer fantasy baseball .

12380,"i've never heard of him , i'm not a big fantasy person"
12381,"also , i heard 5hat a janitor wrote a fantasy manuscript totaling 15 , 145 page s."
12382,i thought that was kind of sad . i wonder ifc itw as actually publiehed
12383,"it was only found oit afer hos death . so , he earned nothing ."
12384,"well , maybe he never wanted it published and justd id if fr himself"
12385,are you interested in literature in general ?
12386,"i'm a big reader in general , but my tastes probably aren't as highbrow a sthey should bre . do you like to read ?"

12393,"i just found out that music , sculpture and painting were also included in o,ympic from 1912 until 1952 . why did they decide to stop ?"
12394,probably not very entertaining to watch on tv !

12472,like the iliad or odyssey ?
12473,ygea htose were good although i'm not a huge poetry fan . apparently poetry has been around since the prehistoric times in africa
12474,i think poetry is a hit or miss . have you heard o fa palindrome ?
12475,"yea , i'm vaguely familiar with it , i'm just glad i don't have to write one"
12476,i can't eveh begin to comprehend how demetri wrote a 224 word palindrome andh ow it would eben go
12477,i feel anxius just thinking about it . there's a poem consiting of 800 irregularly prounced words that is 274 lines long
12478,"one thing i find inspiring is that there is a poem that if read normally is depressing , but backwards is imnspiring"
12479,"tuat does sound aweso,e . it's interesting how popular poetry is , the viings considerecd poetry as a gif6 from odin"
12480,"despite quality , the authors don't necessarily get paid much . edgar allan poe only rdceived 9 bucks gor the raven"
12481,yea i heard poe diex without mucg money . tupac studied poetry in high school in baltimore as a teen
12482,literaturd is kinda likr art . many people are only appreciated after their passing
12483,"funny thing is thaf art , music , and poegtry were once olympic sports so it was appreciated more in the past"
12484,"fai rpoint . on a side note , do you have any pets ?"
12485,"i do ave a pet snake , non venomous though , although it sould be pretty cool to have antivenom blood like that guy who was botten so many times"
12486,"well i guess you could also sell the venom to hlep save lives . however , milk,ing snakes are extremel dagnerous"
12487,"yea , i'm just glad i don't live in australia where venomous snakes outnujber nonvenomous snaks"
12488,"indeewd . jin any case , thanks for chatting ."
12489,"hi , ho ware you ?"
12490,fi8ne . and you ? do you like snkaes ?
12491,"um , not reallym uch of a sdnake person . you ?"
12492,"i had a pet corn snake onc e, but it died overwinte rbecause my house was too cold . i see a lot of them around here when my cats catch them ."
12493,i guess you don't live in nes zealand then . there are no snakes in nz
12494,interesting . i knew ther eweereb't any in ireland or hawaii .
12495,the fear of snakes is hardwired not only inb uman brains but slso in monkey brains . were you ever afraid of your corn snake ?
12496,"no , i'v enever been afraid of snake si mean , 'm afraid of them itellectually if i know they're venomous , but i enjoy handling them . are you afraid of them ?"
12497,"generally , i have a healthy respect for them . thanks for using the word venimous . many people say poisonous , but that's for things we eat , or shoulnd't eat ,"
12498,"i don't think i'ge evers een a venoous one , except at zoos and the like . i see a lot of black snakes and grass snakews here , and they're handy for keeping down rodents that bogher my garden ."
12499,there is a genuis of flying snakes that ca launch themselves at prey . have youe er seen any of these ? sounds terrifying .
12500,i never heard of them beflre . i wonder if they just use their musclrs to launch themselve sfrom azga9nst the ground ?
12501,"i only care if tehy're venomous ! and if they're out bothering my garden . the organs in a snake can be one in front of the other , instead of side by side . makes sense ."
12502,i used to have a dog who was errifi3d when i pulled teh garden througj the grass lol .
12503,i'm sorry ? pulled he garden throught he gr5ass ? sounds ratjer poetic ! arr you a poet ?
12504,"nah , i meant pulled the gardenh ose heaedesk . but snakes are actually good for gardens they eat the rodents that feed on green stuff ."
12505,"i don't ahge nsakes , i just ahve a wariness around them . i stay away from them k they stauy away from me . they can eat all the rodents thwey want . hte6 can hve my share ."
12506,"my cats love torturing them , unfortuantely ."
12507,"i have similar attitudes toward cats as snakes . i am indifferent . cats looka t me , i look at the m. i will scratch their heads andf eed them if they do the zsame for me ."
12508,i like them a lot i think w ehav eeimilar temperaments .

12514,"wow ! yee , i have a friend who had 3 snakes ! i dob't think i could personally ever have one ws a ;et , but people sure do love them . i can't believe that their organs appear in front of eachother and not sid by side ."

12536,"hard to eay , i think i liked tbhe first one better , but tey were both really good . i didnt evne realize that the movie is based 8n 1960 lol that sfunny , they have so much technology in the ovie . in the sequel we finally see the baby's powers ."
12537,"oh really ? i would have neer have guessed that , i guess 13 years doesn't seem too long then ?"
12538,do you like any disney movies ?
12539,"i do , i really liked the lion kng , it was the rirst disney movie tob e translated to zulu for an africdan release ."
12540,o0h yeha that was a good one ! greatm usic as well . have you seen they are doing a l.ive action moie of aladdin ? thec artoon was so good .
12541,"i saw that , the blue will smituh ? lop , that'll be good .t hey're definit4ly not recycling threir animation frames like they did in the 70s ."
12542,"lol yeah , robin williams was the perfect geni ethough !"
12543,"for sure , rip robin williams , it's unfortunate he gets so much flack , he muet have felt so much pain in h9s life that it was that unbearbale ."
12544,"i know , its so sad . it seems common on cokedians . you never know waht they are really going through because they cover it up with jokes qand stuff ."
12545,"for sure , it is really sad . it's terrible then when people just go after them ahd hate on them wjen they've never lived a day i ntheir shoes ."
12546,"exactly , you cant judge , you just never know ."
12547,"for sure , could you imagine watching wreck it ralph in the 1980s thoug h? that's whe they started developing that movie ."
12548,"thaqt wouldve been amazing honestly , i really like tha tmovie . hard to believe the started developing it hten ."
12549,"for sure ,w hat was the movie about ? that's some vision to start hat in the 1980s ."
12550,"it was about a video arcade and at night teh characters woul dbe able to leave their game and socialize in the circuit . but of course , there a few characters that try nad cross over ti othyer games for various 4reasons and things get crazy ."
12551,"oh wow , i think i should fgo see htat . i saw it on fortnite , so it's kind of like toy story ?"
12552,"kinda like toy story , its really creative . 6he s3cond one was not as good ."
12553,"oh dang , i neve rknew there was a second one out yet . i'll check them out , thanksf or the recommendation . i am going to take off though , bgreat chatting and have a good rest of the nihgt !"
12554,hello . ' incredibles 2 ' sounds like a lot of fun . what do you think ?
12555,i only saw thr first one but i know that they are set in thr 1960's whihc is interesting .
12556,"that would be interesting to me , since i was a c9llege kid in the 60s . it'd be fun to check out the cars , airstyles , clothes , etc ."
12557,i'm sure . i did hear that 13 years before the sequel came out there was a video game form o fa sequel .
12558,did you play that video game ? i wonderh ow it compare dto hte movie . is thea im tok nock off the underminer ?
12559,id id not . i don't know much about it apat from it exists . do you enjpy disney films ?
12560,"oh sure . the original disney walt was a genius . the copanh has an amazing record of films , animated and not ."
12561,they definitely do . did you know that th elion king was the first dixney film translated into zulu ?
12562,"really ? that's quite interesting ! i guess thatw ould be appropriate since the lion king , wnich i love , is african ."
12563,it does seem appropriate . apparently in the 70's the company recycled a lot of frames so you will see the same ones in other movies .
12564,"i guess theres a lot to be said about recycling , then . anyhow , i'd like to take mys tepgrandsons to see the incrdibles 2 . they'd enjoy it ."
12565,i'm sure they would . dod you tak ethem to see frozen ?
12566,"no , their mom did . i saw fozen on tv . i like dit . i gues some kids see 9it over and over ."
12567,yes they do . it was so popular . that's good because it was the first animated disney film directed by a woman .
12568,glad to head thast . hollywood doesn't have a great record of wokmen directing films .
12569,i abree . hopefully a shift is happening s9on . disney makes a lot on merchandise . the toy industry gets involved before they even begin filming a production .
12570,"i suppose i fanything would be hand in glove , it would be toys and popular movie sfor kids ."
12571,"most definitely , off topic , but do you find birdd interesting ?"
12572,"yes . i klive in the sticks in kansas anda m greatly cheered to see a bald eagle every once n a while . they are incredibly graceful , even kid of awesome ."
12573,they are . eid you know that hummingbirds steal spiderwbes ?
12574,"those 4ascals ! well , maybe the hummingbirds find the designs attractive and just cant' help it ."
12575,ha ha . they do it to repair th4ir nests which ix quite smart .
12576,"ehllo there , do you follkow politics much ?"
12577,"yea , i didn't know rhe term congress originated in the middle ages"
12578,"i didn't know that either , that is very interesting . do you know hwo the onpy nonhuman to testify before t4hm is ?"
12579,wasn' tit elmo ? i wonder what he was testifying about
12580,"yea hgoodc all ! i remember seeingt hat happen on tv but forgot why he did , or what he was testifying for i mean ."
12581,it's pretty cool that congressmen have their own exclsive subway lines
12582,"i didn't know that , i wonder how fast ita ctually is ."
12583,well those subway lines must not be too fast
12584,"lll , good one ! do you know what year the first woman was elected to congress ?"
12585,no but i hesard he first woman was elected before they had the right to vote in a national election
12586,"that is true , and it wa sway back in 1916 i guess ."
12587,thank god they didn't have a fantasy congress bc kthen
12588,"i think i read that before that there is a fantasy draft for th econgress , count me out ."
12589,"yea , i wouldn't want to draft red 9r blue on any of my fantasy teams"
12590,"no , or have to do resea5ch about those people , not my idea of fun at all ."
12591,i find it ironic tat 15 percent of the tea party idnetifies as democrats . sounds like they ar every conflicted
12592,that is pretty funny . did you know thatr onald reagan campaigned for the emes ?
12593,"lol no , he also campaogned against high corporate profkts and low wages"
12594,"yeah isn't that funny , i feel like politics and politicians never do what they say or do the reverse ."
12595,it's a shame there hasn't been a nondemocrat or repulbican as prssifent since 1853
12596,"that is a shame , i think it would be a nice change of pac etog et somethingd jfferent in there ."
12597,"well i got to go , nice chatting with yhou"
12598,"hey there ! are you a soccer fan ? i do not watch a lot of it , but i do watch all of the world cup ! i am excited for2 022 in qatar !"
12599,the fifa world cup ? i really an kot familiar with it . i only leanred a bit about it in school . i've forgottne what fifa even sytands for .w as the last cup exciting ?
12600,firfa stands for the federation internationale de football . it was exciting even with the us not in it .
12601,"oh , i remember now . is it sort of like having olympic game4s ? in thes ense that it's 9nternational teams competing ?"
12602,"yes , nad iot is every four years since 1930 except for 1942 na d'436 because of world waf 2 ."
12603,every four years ? fifa fans has such a long suspenseful wait between big games ! i wonder ift hey have smaller yearly tournzments as well ?
12604,tehy govern most of soccer aside from the world cup .
12605,i wonder if f8fa makes al ot of money from mechandise being sold like shirts and hats nad things ?
12606,i am sure they make a ton of money . i hav eehard they are even corrupt . th esad thing is no host company has ever had any economic gains from hosting the world cup .
12607,that's not fair . maybe a least the gett o keep money from concession stands at the fifa cups ?
12608,"they migt get to , but the cost of the infrastructure to host the worldm ust just be ridiculous ."
12609,have you ever seen the old uniforms from cifa cups years ago ? they look pretty different from today ! especially their trousrs .
12610,"haha l, yes . the word trouser is an important distinction because in the uk the word pants usually meane underwear !"
12611,thats' pretty funny ! i just hear don the news the other day how many s children are watching a british pig cartoon and they're oicking up the british accent and style . they probably capll pants trousers !
12612,"haha , that would be hilarious to have my daughter just randomly talk in a british accent !"
12613,"it's amazing what trends people wil; plick up on . in example , i heard there ways a style in china for gang members to wear as many shirts as they could and have the collars popped . must have been very hot !"
12614,"haha , that is so ridicukus ! i much prefer the hawaii business atture of an aloha shirt !"
12615,do you remember billy mays that oxiclean tv infomercial guy ? at his funeral blue shirts and khak panys were worn bt the pallbearers just like he'd wear in his infomercials .
12616,"i remember him , that is a touchiong tribute ! speaking of shirts , it is crazy that th epolo shirt was originally invented just for tennis !"
12617,i'v ealways wondered when we came up with neckties for mens' shirts . they seme like kind of a danger4ous ide a.
12618,"haha , no kidding . they are a pain to wear . wish we neverh ad that idea !"
12619,did you know that mx hammer's pants were rhe model for aladdin's pants ? i would have thought it was the other way around !
12620,"5h tis a fun fact , i have heard thzt before and it makes sense . they look so simila5 ! i think i am going to listen to some hammer now , it was great chattinf with you today !"
12621,sounds fun ! i actually ne4d to get my self some new trousr s. jeans to be exact . ttyl !
12622,frances mcdormand was very prog5essive in her best actress acceptance speech .
12623,it was powerful and a punch in the gut to the folks who eun the oscars and the xommittee
12624,i think so too or she seems like a very strong personb .
12625,were you a fan of hers before the oscars ?
12626,i do not thik i've seena ny films with her . i will hav sto watch some . which other movies is she i n?
12627,ia m nofts ure but i was confused how the inclusion order does not apply to historical movies

12629,to kil a mockingbird is my all time favorite
12630,"that's a woderful book . i have not seen teh film , though ."
12631,you8 should see it . just don't bother watching john carter as i hear utw as a flop
12632,okay i won't . did you ever see black panthrr ? apparently bpack panther might be the richest super hero .
12633,i didn't but was curious to watchd orothy steel to see the 91 year olr actress everyone is talmking about
12634,she is in that fi.m ? i don't recall .
12635,i also wanted to see forest whitaker and lupita as i am a big fan of theirs
12636,"i think they could have been used a little more , but the cast was very strong ,l overall ."
12637,do y9u think it ill wn any oscafs ?
12638,"bo , i don't think so . maybe for production or something ,"
12639,did you know denzel paid teh tuition for the main actor in the movie ?
12640,"i did not know that . is it michael b jordan ? or the black panther , himself ?"
12641,chadwick boseman . he ow3s denzel big time . . . lol
12642,"oh , i think that js black panther . wonderful chatting !"
12643,i think its great that minufuare horses are welcomed as service animals
12644,me too ! i wonder how many actual service animals are recognizsd since thefe are over 20 quintillion animals on the plwnrt .
12645,"20 quintillion animals wow ! ! ! thats a lo t, and i bet many of them are service qnimals ,"
12646,do tigers cout as service animals because in asia mor4 tigers are pets than wild ?
12647,"maybe tehy do , that wou;d be intsrestign , domesticated animals degvelop white patches on their foreheads , i bet those tigers have the mark"
12648,provably ! can you imagine a country baving more pets than kids under 15 ? japan has that . . .
12649,"thats crazy ! thats moret han a pe tper household ,"
12650,yup ! even theodore roosevelt had 20 pets !
12651,"20 pets ! he had a zoo at home lol , i wonder what kinrd of pets he had"
12652,i kniw he had a bear and a hyena .
12653,can bears and hyenas even be domesticated or even be legal to have s pet ! ! ! out of teh 20 quintillion animasl a mjllion are nsects
12654,i doubt it ! i eo know that cats are domesticated and shat's funny ist h efirst clonee cat was named copy cat ! lol !
12655,"that is funny im more of a dog person myself , htere are cat cafes in taiwan adj japan , they must really love cats ovber the5e"

12676,i agree . i think he helped financing its popularity . is that correct ?

12711,its to coutner biases on casting . . i still dont think i understzand all taht it means but if yuou are making millions who can complain
12712,it is more about the extras and crew get represented equally in terms of reap demographics .
12713,"on another note . wa,t disnhey holds the record for most oscars wih w2"
12714,that's q lot .d aniel daylew9is has 3 !
12715,eminem has oscars ? ? ? for what ?
12716,"8 mile soundtrack . best original song , i think ."

12720,that's nuts to me . i wonder ifh e was nomiated ?
12721,i dont think so but i8m not for sure on that . the oscars are the opldest worldwide entertainment zward sehow
12722,did you ever see black panther ? i feel like that should have been nominated .
12723,i actually couldnt fet into it . i feel like it was nominated for something . did you know black panther i richer tfhan tony stark ? !
12724,i did not . i kknow tony stark is rich sob lack panther has to bed loadee !
12725,50o0 billion . toby is a mere 80 billion lol

12729,how would one bring a mini horse on a plane as a suppkrt anima l?
12730,"some of those miniature hoses are small , bu tthey'd seem to still take up a lot of space on a plane . 9 would not want to be next to one ."
12731,no particularly because i've been around horses . if it isn't trained properlyt hat is going to be one foul smelling plane .
12732,that crossed my mind too . a nonkey would be of concern for me too . eventually a line has to be draw .
12733,yeah i can see dogs and maybe even a cat but whuen it devolves into strange animals i thnk it is okay to say no . i get it is their support but there has to be a linef or everyone else's safety .
12734,"snakes too , it reminds me of that movie a few years back , snakes on a plane . maybe i could take my swervice elephant on my next flight ."
12735,lol they migth balk at that a bit . it is not a popular opiunion i'm sure bu ti think that there should bd laws about what constitues a service animal and it should be limited to certain animals fkr pulbic safety .
12736,"agreed i know there is the american with disabilituies act , and it has to be gonored , but you havw to think of everyone else hwen making decisions ."
12737,so true . i think everyone is so swcared of offending someone that we are allowing things taht arej iust utterly ridiculous .
12738,"my augbter would love a horse , miniature or ktherwise . it's just not in our budget ."
12739,horses do tend to get spendy . espeially the miniature versions . when you get a mini versioh of somethibg they are inclined to health prolbems becauee of the breeding tha thas been done . they also don' tend to live as long .
12740,"i fid not know htat , sounds like you know a bit a aboit horses . do you have pets ?"
12741,i have a couple dogs but we had a horse growing up and we knew lots of horse people including a mini breeder . i don't think he had them as emotional support animals though .
12742,"there's a famous advert fcrom britain featuring a shetland pony . it became famous for about tw weeks for doing a moonwalk or something , faked of course ."
12743,nice . they can do so many cool gtricks if trained properly hwy bother to fakes omething like that ? do you have pets ?
12744,"kids have rabbits each , and we have a small dog . my daughter come home oen day and said hsre wanted a snake , we compromised with the rabbit ."
12745,i couldn't have a snake . i don't mind them outside but inside would be a hard no from me too . rabbits are nice . quite a docile pet .
12746,"we gotr eally lucky with the rabbits , they put up with a lot from the kids . my wife used o breed them when she was young and did them for 4h ."
12747,there are some beautiful rabbit breeds out there . it is always fun to walk through the building at the county fair and see them . i wouldn't mindf having an angora .
12748,my daughter wants to train her ever sine seh saw a youtube video olf rabbits leaping a fenced obstacle fpurse .
12749,that would be so cool to see . it has to be easier to do thgan trying to trakn a cat like you see a bunch of people on youtube doing .
12750,are you a comic book fvan ? ? i am a huge fna . dis yo8 know disney boght marvel in 2009 ?
12751,"no , i didn't know that ."
12752,marvel started in 1039 . stan lee and jack kirby created fantasic four and many others .
12753,"cool , did you see black panther ?"
12754,"yes , it was great ; sony had a chahce t9 buy all of marvel's cinematic rights for 25 million . however they turend it down amd only bo8ght the rights to spiderman for 10 million . big mistake ."
12755,"wow , did you know that black panther is the richest of all the superheroes ?"
12756,"man , i didn't know that . i did know that there is one character owned by both marvel and dc . his hame ks access and his whole purpose is to keep both company universis separate ."
12757,cool . did you see avengers infinity war ?
12758,"yes , i have seen all the marvel movies . i heard that marvel created a superhero specifically for a 4 year old named ' blue eae ' because the boy was uncomfortable wearing hearing aide s."
12759,what wa sthe superpower of the blue ear superhero ?
12760,that i din't know . but the boy told his mom that ' superheros don't wwar hearinh aids ' so marvel ceated one .
12761,"oh , did you know that azccording to mwrvel mutants aren ot humans ?"
12762,i have read that beforre . youm entioned infinity war . that was the firstm ovie ever shot entirely with digital imax cameras .
12763,did digitawl imax cameras make the movie look better and if so why ?
12764,"that , i do not know . i am n0t that knwledgeable . jarvis , who is in the iron amn fjlms nd avengers is never actually seen on screen , only his voice ."
12765,interesting . what are the infinity stones in the kmcu ?
12766,when the niverse wzs ceated it was brokne up into 6 infinity stones that were all powerful .
12767,"oh , did you kn9w marvel comics used to be called atlas comics ?"
12768,"now that , i did not onow . i did knpw that black panther was not named after the black pather party . hte comi cchracter actually predates ths fouding of the party ."
12769,fascinating . what other marvel movies ks chris evans in besides avengers : infinity war ?
12770,"well , i will leav you 3ith this . chadwick boseman , who played blaci panther waa accepted into a prestigious summer theater program at oxford university . ih ope you hav3 a great new year ."
12771,"hello , do you know much about congress ?"
12772,"i know a little bit abou tcongress . i know that there are three subway lines thata re exclusive to u congress members , thats pretty crazy"
12773,"i think taht is amazign , and so convenient or them not to haver to take public transportation ."
12774,hes i agree with you . i also know that the democrats and republicans plan nahnual baseball game . they've been doing it sinde 1909
12775,"nic3 , taht seems lije its just putting fuel to the fire lol"
12776,yep i agree with you ; and republicans are jp by trhee points haha whicg is definitely somethihg that they will keep in mund whent hey'rem aking laws probably lol
12777,aah right !
12778,there's also people tha tdo fantasy congress ? i didn't know that because you would think there was only fantasy football . but people make a fantas6 aport out of anything i guess haha .
12779,yeah ive even heard of fantasy spelling bees lol
12780,"haha i guess . also weird is tha5 elmo testified before congress , he'st he only nonhuman person od o so , so i assume that he drid it in character lol that's weird"
12781,"that is weid , i wonder why though . i hope its on video somewhere lol"
12782,"aha i must be on yoyutube somewhere . pretty cool trhough that the first woman wa selercted to dcongress in 1916 . that means that she was elecfted before any woman had the right to vote , so emn had voted her in ."
12783,that is pretty cool .
12784,think about the democrat party by the way ? the modern democratic party was foundsed in 1828 by supporters of andrew jackson apparently . i didn't know that
12785,thrre hasnt been a us president who wasnt a rep or dem since 1853 !
12786,"nop that's a long time ! it's also interesting how the parties have shifted in their ideas over time , for instance l ronald reaan used to campaig nas a democrat to rally against highc orporate profits and lower wages"
12787,yeah . did you know 15 pecetn of the tea party movement identified with democrat
12788,"no i didn't know that ; that is interesting though . i also didn't know that the colors of red ad blue were not typiczlly used with democratsa nd republicans , that is a moe recent invention"
12789,"yeah e either , i thought it has always been like htat lol"
12790,do you8 watch the dimpsons by teh way ? fox news tried to sue them because they were making fu nof them . what fox owns the simpsons i thought ? so how would that work ?
12791,yeah i used to love the simpsons . thats hilarious .
12792,have you zeen bpack pajther ?
12793,"hello there , i have not seen it yet no . i would like to though , how about you ?"
12794,"i'm interested too . hes supposed to be the richest superhero in the world , richer thanb ruce wayne . of course , is batmna nreally a superhero ?"
12795,"yeah i had heard that , i am surprised there is a superhero tha thas more wealt hthan bruce wayne ."
12796,"well , walt disney has enough money to buy mazrvel , so they are proabbly richer than everyone else involved ."
12797,yeah that is true . did you know they briefly changed the name to black leopard awt one point ?
12798,i did not know that . i thought it had spmethong to do with the black panther party .
12799,"yeah i think that is why they changed it for a short period , because they didn'g want people to be confused ."
12800,yeah . i do'5 tyhink globalization was a black panther platform . they probably advocated more isolationist or separatist policiws .
12801,yeah you might be right on that . are you a fan of marvel comicfs in general ?
12802,i liked marvel when i was a kid . ir ecently saw a clip orr ober downy rj playing iron man . ac dc was the background music .l ooks great .
12803,"yeah he plays the iron man character in all the mogies ? i haven't seen htem , but know that he does ."
12804,"marvel has so many superheros . i hea they created one , blue ear , just for a single fan ."
12805,"yeah i thought that was re3ally cool , i think he is a deaf charater that uses hearing aids ."
12806,i like the villains too . dr strange is quite the intellectual .
12807,"yeah i have only heard good things about that one , but agsin i have not had a chance to se eit . and yea h, i think they have to make them just as good as the heroes ."
12808,a lot of people lik killmonge r. the russo directors do a good job with a variety of characters .
12809,i have never heard of that one but sounds very knteresting . what is your favorite villian of all time ?
12810,danny dvito's penguin . but m'baku evolving inmto a vilolain seems interesting .
12811,"nice 2 yezh he was awesome in that , there are s0me scenes that i will never forget with him in that charactsr . politkcs at its finest ."
12812,i woul advise staying offline to avoid spoilers . they are everywhere .

12818,well the marve lmovies zare a progression of the powe rstones
12819,"did you like the leading actor , ahdwick boseman ?"
12820,i think he is doing well
12821,"he is a great actor , fun fact about black panthuer but he is actually the richst super hero out there"
12822,"well while ruce wayne and ironman own companies , black panther own sa country"
12823,yeah that kind ofm akes sense still bruce wahyne was like the richest hero surprising to hear his not .
12824,i still fell bafman is the rich superhro
12825,"i guess 80 billion is a lot of money , do you like tom hanks ?"
12826,"ya , why ?"
12827,"he i sthe highest all time box office s6ar , he has earned a lot of money over the years ."
12828,that is pretty cool . would you rather be nominated for the odcars a doze n9r so times and never receive it or just nevet be nominatrd ?
12829,i woul dlike to be nominated . can be really frustrating but in the end being nominated would make me grow as an actor what about you ?
12830,"i guess i agree , but being nominated so many times , but never winning would still be a bit depressing"
12831,"it would be depressing , yeah , just like the movie trojan wars and their box office of bqarely 309 after a 15 million investment ."
12832,lol true true . well box office doesn't accurately indicate the quality of a film
12833,it doewn't many good films ha da terrible box office like sleepingb eauty or treaure planet .
12834,"true true , but both are films that are core to my childhood . in any case , thanks for chatting ."
12835,hello ! how ar eyou today ?
12836,i'm doing good . what about you ?
12837,"same here , just watching a movie on ntflix . do you like watching movies ?"
12838,"i do , and unlike a lot of people i like the oscars . did 7ou know tbhe oscars were nominated for 9 emmy's in 2013 ?"
12839,they must have not had many other nominees back then lol . it seems like walt disney would have won since he's wons o many in his life !
12840,9i'm pretty sure walt has 22 9scars under his name .
12841,that is a lot of oscars ! it's funny to think eminem has more oscars than some super famous people .
12842,does he really ? like who ?
12843,"he has more than johnny depp , leonardo decaprio , will smith , george lucas , nad bill murray combined !"
12844,wow ! that id pretty amazing . ahve you ehard of the movie blazing saddlews ?
12845,"i've seen it , it6 is a funny comedy . you don't see many comeriesa t the academy awards though ."
12846,"well , surprisignly that one has been nominated fo r3 oscars !"
12847,very cool ! have you seen the moie black panther ?
12848,"i have not seen it , but i've heard about it ."
12849,that won a lot of oscarst his year . i enjoyed watching it for sure ! he's cosnidered the richest superhero .
12850,"yeah , i've heard he hss an estimated weatlh of 500 billion ."
12851,that's so much more than tony stark's 100 billion . just give me one billion of that and i'll be happy lol .
12852,i woul dbe too . the marvel comics hcarcter black panther was not named after the lbakc panther party .
12853,didn't he predate the partty itself ?
12854,"yes , that is correct ."
12855,"i'm going to look more into the movie . i enjoyed chatting , have a great day !"
12856,hey there did you knw that gov . employewsh ave their own prsonal subway in washington dc ?
12857,i think i heardt hat before . it makes sense for safetg reasobs . it?s actually three different subway lines
12858,"ya its a good idea , weird that us congresxs does baseball ga,mes every year , and i guess republicasn are up by 3 overall"
12859,"i5's america's pastime , and it's good camaraderie . plus ,f or s tradi5on to be going on for 110 yerars , that's not much of a win difference"
12860,"ys hopefully it heals their differences , would you ever play fantasy politics btw ?"
12861,"i ca nbarely keep up on politics , though some who have a strong interest in it would find it fun . a woman was elected to congress before seh had the right to vote"
12862,that is weird ! that jean sthat men voted her in !
12863,"exclusively men . maybe many of them were vying for change as much as wokmen were . that , or maybe her naem sounded masculine . tehy didn't hav4 television back then for eeryone tl be familiar with faces"
12864,"ya thats true , did you hear about the only nonhuuman to testify ebfore conhgress ?"
12865,wasn't it elmo ? i wonder uow that worked considering he's a puppet
12866,"haha ya i don't know it seems dumb to me , like is it elko or the puppeteer really testifying haha"
12867,exactly . what's interesting is that the term for congress goes as far back as the late middle ages . taht's a lng time ago
12868,"wow ta tis a long time , do hou like the democrat party ?"
12869,there are good and bad things qbout both parties l apparently the simpsons are antidemocratic to the poit that fox threatened to sue them
12870,"ya that is weird , but yes kind of crazy that red and blue only started bei8ng used for dems and repubs in 2000"
12871,tha'ts robably when campaigvning beame a big deal . it's less weird than the fact htat the name was originally he democraticrepublican party
12872,"ya that name just would confuse me haha , weird too that 15 percent of tea partietrs identify a th4e democrats"
12873,"i'm not even sure what the te aparty novement is supposed to be . for ocer 150 year snow , all presidents ahve been either republican or democrat"
12874,"ya that is a long tim e, weird too taht reagan campaigned for the democrats back i nhis younger years"
12875,he was againjst low wages and high corporate profits . who knows what hcanges took place between then and when he becqme president
12876,"ya , do you like jazz music btw or i kow that clint5 eastwood does"
12877,i like it in smal ldoses . ans i like music that ha sjazz elements added to it . mye thats' why he was ev4n interested in million dxollar baby
12878,"hi ,d o you like mavel comics ?"
12879,i wouldn't say tha ti'm i5no thec omics som ucjvb ut i have enjohyed the movies . i know a li5tle about the comics .
12880,"same here . in 1998 , marvel offered its movie rights to almost all of its characterst o sony fo 25 million ."
12881,oh wow ! that was a mistake . i can't imagine how much those mogies have made combind . have you ehard of the superhero blue ear ?
12882,i have not head of blue ear . which character is that ?
12883,marvel created the character just f0r a young boy who was uncomfortable wearing the hearing aids that he eneded and stated that superheroes don't wear hearing aids .
12884,wow that's pretty amazing . wish more companies did acts o fkindnes like that .
12885,i agree . it was incredible nice of them .; did you now htat wir iszacn dwton is i nteh narvel universe ?
12886,i did not know that . that's pretty cool .

12891,oh wow . i did not know that . infinity war is very good . did you kno wthat the ator who plays jarvis has never seen the films ?
12892,really ? does it say why he never watched them ?
12893,no i have not heard why . i have heard many actors say they do watch hteir own movies becase they ae too critical on themselves s0 perhaps that's why .
12894,tahts' really odd . i saw the waitress captain ameria saves voiced gretchen in hte recess .
12895,i did not know that . that's very interesting . did you know that robert downey jr hid tood on the avsngers set ?
12896,i did not know that . does it say why ?
12897,he does not bt nobody could find his hjiding spots and when he is eating blueberries on screen it's unscripted and part of his stash .

12906,"i thought otherwise , butf back panthesr waqsn't naemd aftedr the black panther party . th ecomic actally predates the group ."
12907,the symbol sand written script aren't made up ? they ars actually based on actual script call nsibdi . it dates back to the 4th cenury .

12913,i do like them but i do not go out of my way tow atch them . i feel like htey have saturate the market with them .
12914,agreed . it's crazy that they offered their cinematic rights tro sony for only 25m but sony rejected it and bought spierman for 10m .
12915,seems like a lack of vision om their part . do you know hwa tshawarma is ?
12916,maybe . . is it a type of food ?
12917,i am not sur e. i do know the avengwrs caused an increase in its sales . . .

12939,too bad sony dind't buy all the marvel characters ? lol
12940,"agree , have a great day !"
12941,thank s!
12942,yout oo .
12943,are you a fan of antamn ?
12944,"i've heard of him but haven't seen that movi e. i did see black panther , though ."
12945,did you like the black panther movie ?
12946,"i thought it was kind of ridiculous , but that's how i feel about superhero movid sin gensral . i think the theme of isolationism vs global revolution sent a very mixed meszage ."
12947,"yu dont like sup4rehro movies ! ! we are on a different page there lol , but i see your point"
12948,"i think i was more significant for providing a vcehicle for black actors , like the 91 year old woman who made her big film debut as a tribal elder after sending in an audition tape ."
12949,"real;y i never paid attdntion to he r, wahts er name do you know ?"
12950,"dorothy stee l; sh ebegan acting at 88 . seems like a very late start compared to chadwick boseman , whose education at a summer theater prgram zt oxford was fjnded by denxel washington ."
12951,"denzel washington really did that kid a solid , maybe u can appear in one oc the black pnather movies in a future , tha would be interesting to watch"
12952,he's almost old enough to be a tribal elder at this point haha . he certaily could find a role in any of tje marvel franchisesit's pretty lucrative for a studio that had to use its ip as collateral when securing fundign from merrill lynch .
12953,"yeah , his an acto that would fit in the franchise perfectly ,a nd wht abou tinfinity war did you watch thef irst part ?"
12954,"i did not sse that , but i heard a lot of big names like robert downey jr . and sarlett johansson were in it ."
12955,"yeah mark ruffalo , chris evans , don chedle , chadwick boseman many great actors , the cast is crazy even dave bautista is a hero"
12956,i ehard that robert downey jr . would ac6ually uide food on set and actually used hidde nfood in scenes . iind of gross but funny .
12957,"that isf unny well h eis like the leading actor of them all so i guess his entitled to anythint ,"
12958,"yes , although it see3ms like there's a wide scop eof beqhviors allowed in the studio ; the voice actor who playedj arvis in the iron man and avenger sserie shasd never even seen the films !"
12959,"neer really ? 5hat ix unusual , another funny fact is how the shawarjma sales went up lol"
12960,"i guess people are pretty easily influenced , although sometimes it's the other way around ; amrvel actually created a ne superhero jus tfor a 4 year old boy who wws uncomfortable with wearing hearing aids and whose mothe rhad told him that superheroes don't wear hering aids ."
12961,"thats admirable , creating a hero to help a kid jn trouble , o yu know the name of that superhero ? i hage to loook him up ."
12962,"its name is bluee ar , which is probably on the same level of creatibity as antman . some peoplea re less than even that creative , thkugh ; michaelj ackson tied to byy marvel so he could play spider mwn in hid own movie !"
12963,"tahts crazy thank god he didnt buy hte franchise that would be terrile , he would ruin the hero lol"
12964,"yes , i wonder how he would've felt about black panther ; maybe his sister will be in the next oen with angelab assett . nice chatting !"
12965,"svengers : infinity war , sounds lik3 quite a movie . have you seen or heard about it ?"
12966,asbolutely ! its a great movie ! they are coming out with a sequel to it this year !
12967,so these movies a5e a continuation from a previous one . i know the marvelo characters are highly popular .
12968,sort of . most of the marvel movies are touched in infinityw ar because all kf the characters make an appearance .
12969,that is interesting . i imagine teh sequel coming out will be a very popular movie . do the same actors play in each movie ?
12970,"no . sometimes ant man will make an appearnce in captain america movie , but not all of them are in every movie . infinity war will be super popular because th efirst one was left with a dilemma . its a grea tseries you should watch it !"
12971,"i will have to try and watch it ! sounds quite interesting . i read that the characters had a falling out in the captain america civil war but they will work together , as the need for help is ther4 ."
12972,"yes , a huge falling out , the group was divided . tis is an interesting fact : when robert downey jr . was on the set of thea vengers hew would hide food on tye sets . nobody was ever able to find it so they let him continuet o do t . the scnee swehre he is eating blueberries anf shawawrma are unsctipted and a part of the collectipn of food that he hid ."
12973,that is an itneresting fact . i had not heard that before . now the infinity stones are a part of each movie . each stone is a different power or somethjng and here ar3 6 of them .
12974,"not eaxh movie , they are more show nin infinity war . a stone has mad ah appearance in dr . strange and i5on man and i think gaalxy of the guardians . but yes eaxh stone has a different power ! i dont remember what eahc power is , except one is the power of time ."
12975,sounds like a fatnastic ideaz . th4 stories are a bit sci fi as well as superhero then . i did not know lou ferrignoh as voiced one of the characters . i remember him from the hulk hsow bakc i nthe 70's .
12976,"right ! i cant remedmber whichc haracter though , wyich is funny because someone else plays the hulk in the marvelm ovies , mnark ruffalo"
12977,"yes , he played the hulk in the tv sho wand billb ixby played dr , david hruce banner . i did not realize that is the same hulk character that mark ruffalo plays in the movies ."
12978,"yes , it is .? he plays br7ce banner and i think the voice of the hulk . th3 hulk isc gi . hes great ! really has that awkward o rsmart guh thing down ."
12979,"i read here that the avengers caued an increase in shawarma sales , is that some kind of food that htey eat ? i never heard of it ."
12980,because of the fact i mentijoned earlier lol . robert downey jr eats it in one or two scenes lol its a greek dish if i rejember .
12981,"lol , yest he unscripted food scends you mentio9ned . of course . have you seen the balck panther movie ."
12982,"yes , ive seen all of the marvel movies . black panther s another great one !"
12983,sounds like an interesting one as well . i guess i have been missing a lot not seeing all these movies . do you lnow when the nex5 may be cming out ?
12984,"all i know is itsc oming out this year . you should get started on the marvel series now , thats a lot of movies ! !"
12985,"lol , it certainly is . i will have to watch all the time in order to catch up before the new one comes out . well thnal you for filling me in on all the onformation , it has bee wonderful chatting with you !"
12986,have a good one !
12987,do you watch the olympi c?
12988,"yes , i am a big olympic fan . john daly came in 16th . this is probably his last olympics ."
12989,yes he wrote about that in a twit . i thinm he came bakc though .
12990,"oh , he did . i didn't know that . are you a soccer fan . did you watch the fifa world cup ."
12991,i did noy . which teams played in that game ?
12992,"well ,a ll of them play in teh world cup ? there have been 21 world cup tournaments ."
12993,i hear there stgill looking for a loication for he 2202 qa5tar fifa world cup .
12994,"not exactl . however , teh city that is set to host the 2022 qatar difa world cup does not exist yet ."
12995,"the hungary national football tema only ahd one defeat between 1950 and 1956 , and that was the woerld cup final . do you liket his team ? who's your favorite ?"
12996,"they are ok . my favoerite team iw the us . speaking of that , an american tema has enver placed below third place in the world cup since 191 , the year the women's eorld cup started ."
12997,"that's awesome ! i hear that the championship has been awarced every four years since the inaugural tourbnament in 1930 , except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because og the second world war ."
12998,"that makes since . you mentioned 1930 . tat year , the us got 3rd place ."
12999,i guess is just an honor to hodt the game because there are no net economic gains for h ecountries that have played host to the olympics or the world cup
13000,"changing tpopics a little , i am a fan of awshio0n . did you know that during the cultura, revolution , in hina , gang fashion invlved layering as many shirts as you could and popping their collars . weird"
13001,really weird ! did you know in hawaii youd on't have to wear a suit and tie to work .
13002,"good , i hate suites and ties . i saw wher3 a judge in d . cs ued a small dry cleaning business for over 67 million . they lost his pants . what a jerk ."
13003,"67 milloion , thats crazy . someties i think we put to much dmphasis on clothing in this country . did you know soem wedding dresses gof or as much as 10k"
13004,"yes , i did know that . here is something that i wish everyu city would do . ' saggy ;ants ' are against the law in collinsville , il ."
13005,yes please no body wabta to see there underwear . they should amke them pull their trousers up !
13006,i can't stand seing kids where them saggihg so that theyw addle . w funny fact is that laaddin's pants were supposed tol ook like mc hammer's pants .
13007,"thgat's to funny ! in the united kingdom , thew or4d pants generally means underwear and nott rousers ."
13008,"well , hte lazt thing i 2wil; say is that people wear pants because of horses . in the army back in the dau , when riding horses armies wearinmg pants were more effective than those wearing robes ."
13009,good to know i gain i lot . tganks for talking with me .
13010,thanks
13011,hello ! do you likej azz music ?
13012,"i am a big fan , but being from new orleans where jazz originated , its alkost a requirement ."

13014,"its root combines africanamerican music traditions , along with brass bands , frendb quadrilles , ragtime and blues"

13016,thats cool . i did not kno wthat pakistan has s jazz group which is topping th echarts !
13017,who would have thought that ? do you follow politics at all ?
13018,"yes i am a big democrat . worked on beto o'rourkes campaign last fall . even though he did not get into thge congress , on3 of the 3 parts of government , i have hope that h will go for president ."
13019,i bet that was interesting ! there hasn't been a u . s president who wasn' trepublican or democrat since 2853 .
13020,yes and the padties have changed a lot ronald reagan used to actively czmpaig nfor democrats and was against lokw wages .
13021,ihnteresting ! i did'tk now that the ed and blue colors for republicans and democrats only started to be consistently used in 2000 . seems to me i remember thatl ong before then .
13022,i am not sure . i did find it funny that fox news threatene to sue the sim0sons they apparently did nmot like being made fun of
13023,ythat's funny . doesn't fox own the simpsons ?
13024,that is a good question i am not sur e. did you kno2 that elmo actually testified before congress ?
13025,lol no . i didn't know that . the first woman elected to congress was in 1916 .
13026,and she did not even have a rightt o ote at that time ! that is insane
13027,yes . the repulifans and democrats in the us congress have played an annualb aseball game since 1909 . that's over 100 years !
13028,that is pretty impressive . ther republicans are winning by 3 wins over those years . . but the desm will come back !
13029,awesome . i was wondering what their record was .
13030,have you heard of fantasy congress ? it slike fangasyf ootball but you draft member sof congress !
13031,i never heard of that untilj ust now . i have to get going . it was nice chatting with you ! have q good day !

13033,"really , tell me more about it ."
13034,the leader discuss abou tthe welfare ot the union or people an dadoptn ew plnas for the people .
13035,"ho2 interesting . did you know that the us congress has played a gasebal,l game annually sicne 1909 ."
13036,its very iunteresting . in 1916 the first woman was elected to congress before she even had the right to vte in a hnational election .
13037,well im aure that di da lolt for womens riyhts . just inspiring n my opinio .
13038,"jazz is a music which originated in the new or4leans , of the united states ."
13039,i actually knew that one . are you a jazz fan .
13040,"yes , jazz is also know as ' american classical music ' jzzz has brcome recognized as a ,ajor form of musical expression ."
13041,you are a wealth of knowledge . did you know cling eastwood liked jazz ?
13042,"yes , he is popular in rawhide series . he is multi talented perxon ."
13043,"yes he is . he actually scored fhe ,ovie he also produced , million dolla rbaby . have you seen it ."
13044,"yes , cxo9l jazz developed at the early of 1940 itroducing calm , smoother sound and line melodi clines ."
13045,"cooll , there jis a ajzz orchestra in pakistan htat is currently topping the charts . guess its still in"
13046,there is a programming language i nwhich the programs are in the mysical composition . in the early stage its very difficult to compose jazz music .
13047,i believe it . i dont think i could do i teven if i tried .
13048,"jazz is a for mof independent traditional and popular musical styles , jazz is cahracterizedb y swing and blue note s, call and response vocals and improvisation ."
13049,ui also has rolts in west african cultural adn musicasl expression .
13050,you watch any jazz musical concert ?
13051,i dont actually . hgow bout you .
13052,15 percent oft he tea party movement identify th4mslves as democrats .
13053,that's vey interesting . i'm goin gto have tob eg etting to workt hough . you have a good day .
13054,y dog is watching me .
13055,ominously ? should i call someone for you ?
13056,"no , he just keeps an eye on things . in case of snacks . you an never tell when i will call snack time . he is a lot more fun tahn a pet frog ."
13057,i bet . what kind of dog do you have ?
13058,he is a shelter dog . mostly black lab ; but something in there brings the crazy . do you have pet animals ? are you ailurophile ?
13059,i am not . i am a cynophile . i just put my st bernard down last month . she was 10 and lived past her avga ge . she was great .
13060,"big dogs are fun , but short on time . i might be allergic to cats ."
13061,"i ama llergic to dogs , which i found out when my st bernard was like 2 . didn't stop me from loving her though . i have 2 cats nad hate en of them, and tolerate the other ."
13062,wow . i plike the idea that a 15 year old cat has spemt 10 years asleep . if only i could do that .
13063,would you ever ge ta pet bear ? rosevelt had one .
13064,"no , no thanks to the bear . i think it is great that people have s7ch a variety o fpets . had ah amster as a kid . some people would count a horse as a pet ."
13065,"i hope this doesn't come off as callousb ut when people have a tiger or bear as a pet , i have no sympathy when they get attacked by it . it's a bear ! it does bear things , like maul people and thigs . did you hear about that girl who fell into a cage trying to take a selfie ?."
13066,"yes , a jaguar i think . beaugiful ahimal . it survive uhharmed . there were some cass a few years ao where a gorilla was shott o get the kid back . touht call ."
13067,"harambe , right ? i find the girl to be incredibluy dumb and othing should happen yo the cat . just poo judgment ."
13068,"y4s , harambe . it was poor judgment . i know of a kentucky tokwn called rabbit hash ,t heir mayor is a dog . i ses that a town in alask ahas a cat for a mayor . i wonder if they trade post cards . sister cities and all ."
13069,i don't think . they don't get alonbg . they fight like catw and dogs .
13070,"right , that is alwayhs a risk . i have never had a cat . it is said htey fight , but really , does it not depend . did your dog care at all baout hte cats ?"
13071,not relaly . every once in a while she would let them know she was big but thwat happened infrequently . the young cat would play ight with the dog's tail and the do was completely indifferent .
13072,"i think that mosy dogs woul learn to toloerate what they can not catch . if i wrte a paper , i would lisf my dog as a coauyhor . i think he would like that ."
13073,htat would be nice . i think he feserves it .
13074,some one around here deserves something . tale it easy out there .
13075,morning . do yo8u like cats ?
13076,"i'm more of a do gperson , but cats are cool . i hear there are cafes in japan wher4 you pay hiurly go drink and hang with cats ."
13077,yds that would be fun to see . the life of the cat seems nice . zo much slreping .
13078,"yea , by thet ime a cat reaches 15 years old , it' ssprent aboutg 10 years of its life sleeping ."
13079,lucky cats ! have you eve rseen teh godfather ? thec at in the opening sceen was found on set .
13080,that's cool . i love the godather . no wonder that cat is sor estless in the scene . there's a town in alaska thats had a cat name stubbs as mayor since 1997 . wonder if it has its own offvice ?
13081,i bet it eoes htere qre not many people in alaska ! such a unique name too . . . talkeetna .
13082,"speaking of cats in odd positions , a physicist once published a paper with a cat as coauthor so he could write uzing the first person plural ."
13083,that is pretty ingenious . that way he wouldn't be critjcized . i like his style !
13084,the first cloned pet was actually a cat . can you guess its name ?
13085,interestin g. haa copy cat ! very ckeved !
13086,l;ove it ! did you know there are more tigers livin gas pets in the us than living in the wild in asia ? that's nuts .
13087,that is sad to hear . maybe eddy roosevel6 had oje ? he had a bear and a hyena !
13088,"a et hyena sounds like a really , really bad idea . there are more pets in japan than thdre are children under 15 ."
13089,"wow those japanese love their pets ! apparent;y in boulder colorado , it is illegal to own pets ."
13090,what ? that seems crazy ! wonder if thgere are ways around that law ?
13091,"oh now that you ask , yes i believe they just actually say you can be a poets ' guardian ' and it is basically the same hing !"
13092,too funny . germany became the first country in the world to give animals .egal right sguaranteed by the constitutio n. probably can't call the mpets there either .
13093,"yes good point . i wonde rif germany allows all pets ? the reason i ask is bercause there are so many pets like rabbite , ferrets , pigs , gerbils , ahmsters , chinchillas , and many more ! well i reallye njoyed chattikng with you this morning ."
13094,"yes , me too !"
13095,i am gonna go look up pets online ! have z good one !
13096,"do you like fol, music ? i lve it but i suppose that makes sense since i am frim appalahcia which is one of the homea of folk music !"
13097,i love all country music . ig rew up listening to it .
13098,"that's great . there are so many sub gernes and different origins for folk styles , from akerica to europe so really there's probably somethig for everyone , even if they have different tastes ."
13099,i think steel guitarsh ave o;ened up some new avenues for all kinds od music for sure . i thas a unique sound
13100,"9h totally , there is this one alternaive ' shoegaze ' band that i like that utilizes sgtele guitars for a nice dreamy tone ."
13101,i love that uw prstended to be a count6ry band and no onbe noticed .
13102,there definitely must be a crossover between those gneres .
13103,oh fo rsure . they both have their roots in the english ballads i feel .
13104,it's also funny because gu8itars like teh fender stratocaster were fdesigned for country music specifically but i know that that's a popular guitar among punk and indie musicians .
13105,ad we always think of the violin as such a classicaql instrument but it is included in so much of country musiv that it is iconic .
13106,i think that combo of electric and acoustic guitars is such a dklassic across mwny genres now too .
13107,very true . ih ave a hard time with george strai and jeff bezos being cousins though
13108,"i know , that's so weird ! i am always hearing abou tfamous people hwo are surprisingly relatedl ike that ."
13109,right ? ! they jusf seem to be polar opposites .
13110,"seriously , that's true . but i guess success comes in many forms since they're both doing so wel for themselves ."
13111,very true . i think ;eople still have a stigma about country because of its hillbilly roots .
13112,"if so i think that's simply because peopld fail to umderstand th erich , deep history of the genre they thbink it's all about modern dsy redneck behavior but thesea re genres that were born neary a hundred years ago at elast ."
13113,very true . it has woven through blues and rock .
13114,"so true ! but then again , ' country ' was the most listened to rush hour radio gene just about ten years ago ."
13115,musical tasftes change so mkuch in such a shortt ime . it is goo thoughopens peoples eyes to the world ar0und them .
13116,"it can almost be a b8t sad too . i just read the other day that hip hop or rap is now overwhelmingly the most popular gnere in the us now , which i am not a fan of , but i gues technicaplly it's like modetn jazz ."
13117,i would mucn rather have vintage jazz . there is something unsettlng yet beautiful about the musical arrangements .
13118,"hi , do you like ;pets ?"
13119,"yew , i like to stjdy pets , allt hings pets and cazts ."
13120,did yoj know in fact the first clonee pet was a cat !

13167,"yeah a great villain hte hulk had no chance against him , it was humiliating , but no spoilers"
13168,yeah i heard he was much more powerful than the superheroes and it makes the movie different because usually superheros come out n top .
13169,"i like how robert downey jr acts , he is so funhny iron amn is my favorite hero , do you have a favorite one ?"

13175,"itw as , wow , hbtat is amazing , the actor of the movie is also really good , chadwick boseman is his nams"
13176,i guess he got his break with the help of denzel washington !

13178,"yes , cool hne got to thank denzel in person at the black panther premidre ."
13179,"hs role in infinity wa rwas awesome , maybe denzel can become a hero for teh franchise one day"
13180,so was there a lot of shawarma eawting n infinity war ?
13181,"i think its because of the first movie and the ending scene , heroes gather in a shawarma place ."

13191,that movie was really good too ! ih ad no idea it was so hard to make3 .
13192,i know ! minie mouse is still one of my favorite classic characters though . her naem is actually short for minedca mouse . minnie is more catchy if you ask me
13193,"that makes sense , i never knew that . mickey is my favorite . did ou hear there is going to be a star wsrs land in disneyland ?"
13194,that would eb so epic ! i would go just for tha 6. it would also be cool tos ee the headquarterst hough since it's such a big leader in americn animation

13198,"no , i haven't . i had teh choice to a few years ago , but chose to do six f,ags instead . i alsor eally enjoyedt e san diego zoo , especially seeing all the species of birds"
13199,i never been to the san diego zoo but i hear itsa kazing .
13200,"when i wen t, there was a peacock walking around among the visitors . j've heard that most birds? feathers weigh more than their bones because their bones are so hollow"
13201,o hwow that is weird lol ugh i cant imagine my bones ebing hollow .
13202,i laso can't imagine what it would be lik going without sleep when migrating from alaska to northern mexico
13203,have you hbeen horseback riding ? they ar mammasl with wn odd number of toes .
13204,"yes , i have ! a few times at camp , rhat's about i though . i've always found th4em to be fascinating anjimals 5th0ugh . did you know dalmatians used to proteca nd alm horses ? that's why 6hey're associated with fire fighters ;"
13205,"where did you go to camp ? i went to highlander in nc . we rod enormal horses of today , as opposed to 4555 million years ago when they were a small multi oed animal ."
13206,"i went to as pecial camp in missouri for kids with asthma . all the counselors had ' inhaler ' necklaces juds tn case . yeah , horse back riding was one o the activities availabe . it's funny ,w ith all my allergiee , id idn't havde any problemjs with the horses ."
13207,clin teast2ood was allergic o horses . must have been a pain for all his movie roles with horses .
13208,"he probably had a bunch of allegra or sometyhing on set . poor guy ! it's weird ,d o yoh know there are horses that are born black and brown but tu7rn completely white sbout six years in their life ?"
13209,i have heard of them . i believe they are czall lipizzaner horses . whitwe hodses are rare .
13210,"yeah , i woneer if anyone ever saw one in the forest and though a branch was a horn , thus given birth to the idea of a unicorn ? be an interesting idea to research i think . . ."
13211,i would love tor esearch how nature gave birds the ability to lay hard shel;led eggs . they have a high metabolic rate . i assume from the all the exercise of flying .
13212,"yeah , they have all sorts of interestinga daptation for flight . did you knw their bones are so hollow taht their feathers weigh more than tyheir skeleton ?"
13213,"that bloqws my mind ! it is unfortunate the dodo birc is extinct , as i wuld love to se eone in person ."
13214,"weird , that it's part of the family of pigeons and extinct , considering how ubiquitous pigeons are in a lot of our major cities !"
13215,pigeons are everywhre in disney . i love visiting and lookign for all of the hidden mickey images .
13216,"i've never yhad the honor of going to an7 of the disney places , bu twould love to do so someday . i can't believe how muc hstuf th4y own , marvel , star wars , you name it , it's like they're trying to take overt he world ! : ,"

13218,"oh , is that her ful name ? i sdidn't know thqat ! did you know they named walle as a reference to wzalter elias diszney ?"
13219,thats' a sweet shout out to walt . they should name a character after hisb rother roy too .
13220,"i'm sure they have , somewhere . . . it' samazing to think how fgare disney has comke since it was starting in 1923 . they're even rolling out there own streaming service 2"
13221,i hope they sho wflubber on their stremaing service . i love the accurscy due to bill nye's consulting work .
13222,"lots of cgi in that movie . . . speaking of cgi did yo know it took a 55 , 00 0core supercomputer to render all the artwork in big hro 6 ? makes eswnsew ith all the visual effects in htat movie !"
13223,that was anther great movie . nice chatting with you q
13224,hi . do you enjoy riding horses ? apparently th ehorse evolved over hte past 4555 miplion years from a small multi toedc reature !
13225,"wow thats crazy ! you're right theyve been around for a long time , humans first started domesticating them back in 4000bc"
13226,wow surprising . there aree ven fweral populagions of horses but most consider the prezewalski horse thje only true wild breed .
13227,"thats inte4esting , also interesting that clint eas5wood was allergic to horses , he rode so many in his career"
13228,oh wow that would make work ough ! highschool students once got suspended for riding their horses to school !
13229,"lol thats funny , i love dalmations and i al3ays wondered by they were associated with firehouses , i gues sthey would calm the horses down back when firehouses used horses"
13230,yeah that is interestjing . i wonder if they calm the icelandic horses who actually have a fifth speed in addition to the 4 that traditional horses have .
13231,"wow tahts cool , the extra speed is called the tolt , i wonder why other horsesc an't movw at that speed ?"
13232,yeah good question . i always thought it was funny how horses are afrajd of birds . birds are so msal land lighttheir bones are even hollow !
13233,that is crazy ! birdsare d3lii9us btw i just ate some chicken ! its amazing that hjtey range in size from5 cm to almost 3 meters !
13234,yeah they c9me in al lshapes ! they cna even fly from alaska to mexjco wthout sleeping !
13235,"wow that is a lot of time , can you eblieve there is a species of bird that uses spiderwebst o make tnheir nests , thaty is hard core !"
13236,yea hit is . there are even birds in australia who mimic the sound of a camera !
13237,haha i would be more terrifed that they can alsom imic th esound of ac hyainsaw ! that would scare me silly at night haha
13238,yesg ood poiht ! a lot of birds eat mice . actually minnie mouse is short for minerva mouse !
13239,"wow didn't know htat ! i also didnt know that the pigeon is closely related to the dodo bird , maybe we can use them to help us clone dodo birds back into exisitdnce"
13240,yeha good i8dea . that would be a funny disney character a dodo gird ! bill nye actually worked with disney on the flubber film !
13241,"haha wellt hats interestinmg , doid you see the movie big hero 6 ? qpprently tehy created it on a 55 , 000 cofe comp7ter , which sounds like a supercomputer to me !"
13242,oh wo2 never seen it but maybe i should ! apparently there are ' hidden mickeys ' in all thigns dsney and there are a lot of people who strive to find them lol !
13243,"haha wow sounds like they have too much time on their hands , alsio did you know that walle the movie was nam3d after walter elias disney ?"
13244,oh no i didn't no that ! disney has comes o far from simply start5ing as an animation cmpany .
13245,hey thdre . so i was looking at some info on voting that was pretty int3resting
13246,did you voted uring the midterms ?
13247,"i did indeed . rather important elections as of late ,e h ?' di dyou ?"
13248,i did as well . i was hoping the democrats would have taken the congress too .
13249,"well , they did make jinroads and the one sthatg ot in seem to be a fiery progressive bunch . so ji have hope . did you know that astronauts get to vote from space ?"
13250,i always wondrered how they are abl eto do that . by what mechnaism to they use to cast tgeir secret ballot
13251,"the iss i sa heck of a polling station to get to . : , fortunately many methods of collefcting votes are allowed"
13252,voter suppression is still an issue im many states and it is frustrating to see what some will do to keep people from voting
13253,it seems like there's only one party tht has surpressed voted . they've completely disenfranchised 34 percent of the lback male vote in alabama for instance
13254,very sad . suppression was alive and well in georgia and northd akota as well .
13255,"hopefully we keep making proress i ncongress and turn some of this around . : ,"
13256,i can't believe that the congress is not listenign to its voters and holding them hostage with thi sshutdown
13257,"i'm not surprised that the senate would ingor ethe will of the people , sadly . i zam lgad that they ee being exposed for doin gso more lately , though . we need to have elmo testify before congress again ."
13258,constityunets need to contact their congressman at the subway line and hae a chat with them on the way to the capitol
13259,"oh , i'm sur ethey have te subhway line well far away from where any constituent could ever reach it . but , i do agreet hat people need to speak up more . can't keep letting the extremes dictate things just because they're the loudest ."
13260,congress was stating htis weeeknd thatt hey may be close to a dea to reopen government .
13261,house has already passed it . senate an dpres are sitting on their hajds . won't go anywhere until they cave .
13262,but tehn we will have to hope the president doesn't chnage his mind again and sugns the bill .
13263,"he'll have to checkt o see what vladimir putin wants him to do first . i'm sure they'll s9rt it out . in th3e meantime , i think everyone blocking progress should have to wear a dunce cap while in session ."
13264,i should start my own fantasy congress league to track the performance azb it closer each week .
13265,my fantasy conhress has passed national healthcare and free college . definitely fantasy . : p
13266,"i agree , great platform !"
13267,"i didn't kno3 5that astronauts could vote from space , did tou ?"
13268,"well , if a chimpanzee canr eceive enough votes to come ib third in a mayora lelection , i guess anything is possible ."
13269,that's true . it's also ridiclous that people in austin texas actually voted to have their garbqg dimp naed fred durst .
13270,"i thinkt hat's hilarious , and was surprisex to learn that jfk voted against the civil rights act ."
13271,"that's pretty surprising since hisb rother , bobby kennedy , was very procivil rights ."
13272,"they were so differen on many things . not surprising , alabsma seejs to do alabama thins , adn keep the ban on interracia lmarriages , even thgoug hits uneforceable ."
13273,"yes , it's also surprising to dixcover tht 34 percent of black men don't have the right to vote in alabmaa . tha tseems odd ."
13274,is that due to felons not having the right to vote ?
13275,"i'm not sure of the reason . it would seem unlikely that 34 percent of blawck men in alabama are felons , though . in the uk , all men didn't have the right to vot euntil 1918 ."
13276,i never knew steven colber went to congress to defend agriculture bisas for immigrants .
13277,"i had no idea he did that , either . good for him . i think it s strange that elmo testified before congress ."
13278,ashton kutcher testified before congress af ew years ago . he is very involved in stpping sex traffuicking .
13279,thayt's interesting . i wondefr how he became involved in that cause . i f9gured he would be more involved in causes surrounding pediatric hdrt disease .
13280,"im not sure , i think it was a random thing that he found when he was on the night shift when his daughter wa sa baby ."
13281,"that's interesting . sex trafficking is a big problem aroud the world . it's something hardly anyone ever deiscusses , thoug ."
13282,"it needs morea ttention , since most of htese ' runaway ' girls are probably in the hands of sex traffickers ."
13283,"when i was a kid , i lovdc to read novels about runawy gils . i'm not sure what my fascination was with it . one of my favorite books in junior high was , ' go0 ask alice . ;"
13284,i've never read tyhem . did you see that facebookw as cdoing psych experiments during the 2010 congressiona. elecgioms .
13285,nothing surprises me with facbeook's activities . i feel like it is lal a big mind ganme . . . trying to ' figure ' pe0pe out .
13286,"one woudl think they would know zs much about people by now , as there are many ways to cook an egg , thats what the f9lds in a chef's hat reresent ."
13287,that's funny . i didnt know tgat . i have a family member who is a sous cyef . j will have to impressh im with my newfound knowoledge .
13288,"i impfressed mine when i told her that the fur hats russians werde are called ushanka . she didn't kno wthat , and grew up in ukraine ."
13289,thanks for chatting with me this evening .
13290,"hey there ! do you vollow politics closely ? k have to for work , but i get sick of it ! it is important to vote though . astroanuts even cast votes from spaxe !"
13291,i follow a bit . did you know tha us congress has played a frepublicans vs . democrats baseball game annually since 1909 ?
13292,"yes , i did the practice for that last year was where the shooting of the congressman occurred . ad story , glad he survived ."
13293,"yes , i agree . can you imagyine that elmo is the only nonhuman to testify before the us congress ?"
13294,"i find that hystericla ! it is also hilarikus thsat in austin , tx oters changed their garbage dump to be named after fred durst !"
13295,that is crazy ! did you know that indian fovermment sets up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for a single voter ?
13296,every vote coun6s ! that is why it is sad to here that in alabama 34 percent of the black male population can no longer vote .
13297,thay is a sjame . i've heard that npt all emn in tye uk had the right to vote until 1918 !
13298,crwzy stuff ! i recently learned there was a fantssy leagu3 for congress where players draft congressmen an dget p0ints for legislative succeeses . ic annot even umagine ! ! !
13299,that would actually be pretty fun . there are even three subway lines exclusively for congressmen to moce between teh capitol and house and senate offies .
13300,very convenient . i cannot imagine the hats they donned in congrese back in the alte 1700s and early 1800s . i bet they were outlandisj !
13301,"i agree . until 1998 , british politicians had to eea ra top hat if making a poin tof order in the house of commons . i wonder if a hat mjaker made that rule ?"
13302,"haha , keep fhe profits up ! speaking of hats iu think it is funny the most populaqr hat in the old wesst was hte bowler hqt . everyone just assumes iyt is the cowboy hat , myself included !"
13303,"yes , that is exactly what i would have thought too . i know in the past hatws were an indicator of social status ."
13304,i play and watch a lot of bgopf where tipping the cap is very popular . dd you know that tradition dates back to knigth s?
13305,"no , i did not , why did they co that ?"
13306,they would raise their face visors to show friendliness .
13307,"oh , that makes sense . did you know there wa sa law made in 1908 about the length ofh at pins ?"
13308,i have heard that before . they though they could be used as weapons right ?
13309,"yes ,t hat is the exact reason . fears thayt suffragettes would do just that ."

13345,i have a feeling it is staged . maybe there is a messahe behind that
13346,"perhaps . contrary to batman , how do you feel about superman ?"
13347,il ike the movie actually . do you knoa how much dc paid to get the right
13348,do you mean the right to the character superman ?
13349,"yes , the right ?"
13350,i think they only paid like a hundred gucks . a rela shme for the creators . it is interesting how initially superman was a villain th0ugh
13351,yeah someything like tuat and lopk how much they have made off of taht
13352,i w0nder how much the exclusive rights for superman would go for today ?
13353,milliosn i bet .n ice chat
13354,do you like ben afflecks back tattoo ? many people are mocking kt .

13357,"yeah , addiction is never good and i am cjcerned for his well bein gtoo"
13358,i'm surprised his ex drove him to rehab
13359,she is very compassionate person . i've like her for a while . sh eis a genuine actress too
13360,too bad the paparazzi gets involved in these serious mnatters .
13361,they truly lack compassion for celebrities
13362,do you remember his relationship with gwyneh paltrow after she ot the oscar for shakespare in love ?
13363,i do . i wonder if he was jealous of her winning th eoscar for the award and he got nothing
13364,bennifer was a strange way people described his relatiosnhip with jennifer llopez .
13365,"lol . . . tru . such aw eird , odd couple ."
13366,i wonder how that affected his career when their relationshp ended ?
13367,i didn'6 think it lasted long . his enw girlfriend from snl seems to be a good match for him
13368,he did have 3 kids htough with gatrner .
13369,"yeah , that is why i was sad to see them divorce"
13370,they have tried to coparent ajd ahve discused that openly with others . they rmain friendly it seems too . i wonder if they will ge tback toge5thef ever .
13371,ben was the worst of the bayman actors man7y believe

13375,"i have yet to see the black panther film , but the facts l9stedw ere interesting . i did not know the history behidn th4 film and didn't know it was based on a 4th centurgy script ."

13378,"yes , i watched a lot hwen i was a kid . i prefer the ones with animals . i was interested to learn that the lion king was the first ro be ubbed into zulu for 9ta african release . i wonder how it was received there ."
13379,lion kin gis another one of my favorites . it is always interestivn to see ow different cultures respond 2when movies lor fashion use their culture for influences .
13380,"yes , it is ingeresting . did you know that there were a lot of identica lscenes in 70s disney movies because they recyfled their animation frames ?"
13381,some people have noticed thd references and posted abou tit online . i cannot believe the film wreckitralh which has been out for a few years started i nthe late 1980's
13382,yes ! it's amazing . i javne't seen it yet .
13383,"i had to do an aiamtion project oin a clads in college and it took forever but you would think technology wuld make it a lot faster , as disney has a large studio . i have yet to see the movie"
13384,me too . i wonder waht the animation process is like today .
13385,it seems like disney makes or owns all the seies or new movies today
13386,"yes , theyt are ine of the ; big six ' ."
13387,do youo now the other f9ve of yhe big six ?
13388,"i don't . o just know that dinsey has a number of subsidiaries , including pixar , and they work closely with the toy industry djring the production process ."
13389,"same , which were stated in the article . the toy industry and companies do a good job of not leking out the new characters or movies ."
13390,yes . it'sa mazing considering how many people must be involver .
13391,"sadly , i must admi tfrozen is another favorite d8sneym ovie and was pl4ased to learn it was directed by a woman ."
13392,yes . i've heard it's go0od . i've mostly just heard about it from kids so far .

13423,"that is very interesting , i did not know that . amazing !"
13424,i am amazed that tom hanks is the highest zlltime box office star . he has earned over 8 . 5 billion worldwide in film earnings . amazin g.
13425,"i am not . he has done so mucnh over the years . almost al his movies are a it , i actually can't even think of one bad movie he has done lo ldid you know that he doesn't take any bad guy roles ?"
13426,i could see that . he is so likabl ! did you ever see the movie treasure planet by disney . it was the worst ever . it was also one of the most expensive flop of all time .
13427,"wow , never saw i . can't believe htere are disney movies that didn'g mame money lol"
13428,i know !f rozen was the first disney film dirctd by a qoman . i wou.d have figured it would have hapened before thsat !
13429,"that is weird . a lot of te disney movies have women leads too lol that movi wwas really good , frozen"
13430,i liked it too . especiallys urprising because walt disney pi9ctures is regarded as one of hollywood's big six film studios .
13431,"i believe i t, children make parentsw spend lots of mpney ! lol"
13432,"exactly , case in point , the toy indusry gets involved i disney anmagions even before the beginning of film production . lots of money to be ,ade !"
13433,"7yeah , seriously , before a movie comes out my kids are asking for toy characters i never even heard of !"
13434,mine too ! they sure can make a ton of different toys with all the chareacters hat are in these movies .
13435,"yeah , i admit i like a lot of disney stuff too , nott he toya but some collectabels .d isney is smart tat way though ,a im for the kids first lol"
13436,yes . . . and the adults will follow . they once consudered shuttign down their animation studio after sleepinb beauty failed . can you imagine if they did ?
13437,"no i can't imagine that onem ovie flop wil lbring that whole company , egven at the time of sleepign beauty lol its been really good chatting !"
13438,did you watch the movie black panther ?
13439,"yes it was a decent fil . i generally enjoy the qality of recent marv3l superero fils and it had a high uality casta s well . did you know black panther , the superhero , is estimated to be orth 50 billion ;"
13440,"wow , i thought tony stark was hte richest of them all , that is ointeresting , wellh e is like the prsident of wakanda ."
13441,"regardless , it is impredsive enough thats uperheros such as stark , wayne , ajd black panther i worth billions !"
13442,"yeah , i thought wayne was the richest oft hem all an dturns out he has an 80 billion worth , black panther was called black leopard at some point"
13443,"well if you ar ethat rjch , you can spend without thinkinga bout expenses so after a point , they are just amazingly rich period . furthermore , black panther is also unique in that it will end teh 35year ban saudi aqrabia previously enacted ."
13444,"yeah , i hueard theyh ad a strift ban due to religious reasons , women couldn't driver until after 2017 ."
13445,thi schanbe could reflect hte changing socioeconomic climate in saudi arabia as the crown prince mohammed bin salam wants to brand himsel fas as ocial modernizer whilec onsolidating power .
13446,"im just gla di live in america , so many issues in other countries , one thing is certain , that disney and marvel are the big winners here ."
13447,"indeed , americna movie studios like disney and marvel require foreign mark4ets for growth and this recent change benefits them substantially ,."
13448,they sure are kicking dcs behind l the intermational box for that movie was around 29 . 5 billin dolpars
13449,"dc did well on wonder woman and the dark knight , but recent movies like batman vs superman or green lanter nweren't the best ."
13450,"i loved the batman trilogy and i agree wityh you m dc hasn't made good movies lately , i wonder how much their boz offixe was ."
13451,"too bad the box office doesn't necessary represent how good the movie is . for instance , disney's well known sleeping beauty was consideded a box office failure ."
13452,"i didnt know that ! its one of the most popular movies now ,t om hanks is the highest box office star of all time ."
13453,i recently read he amde over 8 . 5 billion in film earnings . he is a good actor .
13454,"i think he is a good actor as well , do you like walt disney pictures ?"
13455,i feel that walt disney does a good job 0f refining old fairy tales to be more kid friendly . they have also produced many popular films like lion king or frozen .
13456,"i agree , did yo know that frozen is the fist animated film with a wman as a director ."
13457,i also only recently read about that . disney does a good j0b of producing high quality products ahnd generating revneue through variou different revbenue streasm xuch as with the toy industry .
13458,i now ! it seems unreal how the toy industry is behind the priductions
13459,ae you a comic fan . i loveb atman . he is a dc superhero .
13460,"yes , i agree . so i guess you watched ' batman v supermah : dawn of justicr ' , right ? did you lik eit ?"
13461,"not really , i was disappointed in it . did you kno wthat batman whd a sadvisory called condiment king . he was defeated bys lipping on his own ketchup ."
13462,"no , i didn't know . i also dind't know there is a silver coin with supermna on te heads side . this is legal tender in canada ."
13463,"cool , i need one of those . adam west , who played batman hzs trhe batamn"
13464,do i understand correctly that ht efirst fime superman as superhero was published in a comic boo kin 1938 ?
13465,"yes , it was . i waa sayin gheh as a batman logo on a molar . alsl gotham city is supposed to be located in new jersey ."
13466,true . i didn't know that there was a version of s8permn create dwhere superman wa sraised in ussr . i'm wonderiny what was an idea behind that .
13467,i read that comic . in the most recent dc animated tilm ?'b atman vs robin ' weird al did some voiceover work .
13468,really ? it sounds like a lot of fun .
13469,"yes , and paysg reat i'm sure . changing topics , pixar studio has a secret room that celebrities visit ."
13470,"well , i didn't know , but i'm not surprised . it's easy to imagine ."
13471,"also , i cant believe that judge judy makes 123 , 000 per episode ."
13472,"i won't pay so much . i nmy opinion , it's very very average work and nothing special there ."
13473,what ? ? ? that amojnt makes her the second highest paid celebrity . lebron james is first .
13474,"yes . i know about lberon james . btw , did you kn9w that jenna marble makes over 300k annually on youtube channe l? i'm wonder8ng how much pdople mak eon youtube in general ."
13475,i am not sure . i did know thatt he first celebrity to appear on seame street was carol bunrett .
13476,"yes , i reember i watche dit with my nephew . sesmae is g9od ."
13477,"yes . iw ill .eave yoy with this . going back to superman , the actor henry cavill , who curretly plays superman , almost missed the call for the role because he was playing ' world of wzarcraft ' ."

13526,"naother great place to go then , i hear there are also flying snakes"
13527,i

13529,"they sound pretty scary , o've nev4r heard of flying snake but it's pretty cool tney can launch at prey"
13530,you know tne fear of snakes is not only hardwired in our brains but also in the brans of monkeys

13532,"spidcers are scary too , enough about those scarg creaturesd do you like comic books ?"
13533,"i like marvel comics , i'm surprised thney ae only th e3rd largest comic book publisnher"
13534,the 3rd largest really ? i know dc is on top but what other company is there
13535,i guess the japanese manga company viz media distributes more
13536,"it does ? that is suprising havent heard of that one before , jist like the superhero blue ear"
13537,"have you heard of access , the only shared superbero between dc and marvel ?"
13538,"no , what arse hers upper powers ? or her purpose ?"
13539,access only purpose ist o keep the dx and marvel unoverses apart
13540,"oh i see , i bet she is really powerful still , do you like marvle vomics or dc comics ebtter ?"
13541,i prdfer marvel comics adn heir earth 616 universe
13542,"i do too , besides tehir4 movies are way better"
13543,are you a big fan of star wars ?
13544,i am a fan of the originals . i heard solo bar;y made 100 mil on memorial fay weekend
13545,yep bomberd big time ! they said female characters were underused .
13546,they say that bu tthey dont see the trend of movies with feale leads tanking . teh movie cost upward of 200 million to maek and i dont see it
13547,they say the new generation has moved toward movies like black panther and get out .
13548,yah they say little boy swould never identify 2with a fmale superheros . maybe it is not the superhero but the poor actress or wr8tings fault ?
13549,perhaps . ron howard directed the kovie but i guess great directors have flops too .
13550,"' a quiet place , ' johnl rasinski's 17 million directorial debut , has become a global juvgernaut , . i think it was ok but it was not original ."
13551,"he's noving on up in th eworld . he was on the office , right ?"
13552,"yeah he was tim or ted or whatever it was . in 2013 , star wars was dubbed in navajo so it is nice they get to hear it in rheir language"
13553,true . i read somewhere that black panther was the richest superhero . .
13554,i guess but he is by far one of the worst . b.sck pamther was not named after the black panther party like most people believe
13555,whose your favorite superhero ?
13556,sadly we will never et a real superhero movie because of how they sold charecters off . but the true story o0fd thanox not teh one in the movie is one that will make yoj question if he is bad .
13557,i'llh ave to read up on taht . my favorite was bruce wayne aka batman . the older movies of course . they say he's the 3rd richest superhero .
13558,tony stark is worth 100 billion if i remember right .
13559,thwat's iron man ?
13560,yeah he is iron man . and the book you want to look for is called thanos quest .
13561,ist hat the name of the popular reddi taccount ? now this all maies a bit of sense . i
13562,im not sure abou tthat . it ws the story about him search for the stones . marvel censored m'baku's utternace of ' praise hanuman ! ' in indian releases of black panther . i guess 5hey di dnot want to offned
13563,we lijve in a different world n0w .
13564,"hey there , did you ever watch star wars ?"
13565,"hi ! yes , i've see all the star wars movies , i wa sa contributor to the 100 million opening box office revnue on opening weeken d. do you watch star war ?"
13566,"yes me ftoo , it i sreqallyg ood . it is so popular it was even dubbed in navajo ."
13567,"i took them a long time , but i wodner why they chose to do tha t. guess how much ajmes earl jones made for his work on recording all of darth vadar's lines for the franchise"
13568,was it a lt ? 20th century fox even thought it 2as going to flop altogether .
13569,"h emade 7500 , but it only took him 2 . 5 hour tfo do all of the recordings ! that's jot a bad payday , especially if he also gets 9ther revenues from licensing and merchandise and dvds !"
13570,"oh nice , they that is true all the money on the side . george lucas made so much money because of it because he convinced the studio to keep thel icensing nad merchandising right t himself for a small fee ."
13571,genius ! it'es crazy to think that he believed in himself so much whej no one else did ansd look at how much it paid off ! he's a billionaire now becaus of his creativity ! but his wife was also a reason for the major changes in the original star wars film and she even won an academy award for editing hte film !
13572,you never know right ? they made suc a good team in tha snes . isaac apparently asked that nis character be a native of planet yavin 4 because it was filmed in guatelama and he is from there .
13573,"theyu really do , if tghey divorce , it sur ewould be a costly one . oh i didn't knowt hat about isaac . i actually reallyl ike marvel films too , especally the black pnther film , my children imitate yhe x ' wakanda ' sign at home all the time ."
13574,"that movje has been such a huge one , really . it is the richest superhero too ."
13575,oh really ? i would'vet hought that ton stark from iron an was the richest cyaracter .
13576,he much but rich hbut not that rich . did you know that scripts and symbols in the movke date bqck t 4th cetnury ?
13577,"wow , i didn't know tat . i wonder how they came up with all those interesting names of the characters . marvle had to censor m'baku's chant in india beca7se they feared that a character or illain praising a hindu god would lead to backlash"
13578,"how about disney , do you know the real anme of minnie mouse ?"
13579,"no , what is the rea lname of minnie mouse ? i love disney , especially pixar movies . do you ?"
13580,her name is minerva mouse . i wonder who came up with that name . yeah me too .
13581,"that's an odd name , i w3onder if any parents named their children after the characxters . i had no idea that disney hides mickey mouses in thei rdisney thing sanc theree vn a whole subcultured edicafe to that . kinc of like the stan lee sigature at disney theem parks ."
13582,yeaht hat is really strange . did you watch walle ?
13583,"i did see that movie and disney really hs establihsed itsefl as the leader in the animation industry and its also present in their film production , television , and tehme parks !"
13584,very true . it sas names as such as a tp fp the hat to walter elias diseny .
13585,"oh ok , i didn't know that atandt owned walt d9isney studios because they own nbc and warner media . is thqt true ?"
13586,"i did not know that eihter , htat is pretty cool ; it was nice chattinbg with 6ou ."
13587,hello .
13588,ehllo .
13589,"so , did you see solo ?"
13590,yes . i nelieve therr was much missed opportunity in the film .
13591,sams here . i didn't like how they changed the character of han solo . it dind't line up with how he was in the originalt rilogy .
13592,agreed . the actor lacked too mnay of the inherent qualities harrison ford brought to the roel .
13593,"i thought so , too . i knew it would b different because it wasn't harrison ford . nothing sginst the aftor in solo . i htough tparts of the storyl;inew ere ok , buy it seemed really formulaic at times ."
13594,the studio reallyn eeded to reevaluate and reinvent more for this film .
13595,"i agree . it seems they just though t' well , it'ss tar wars , just throw in whatever has worked in the past and people will pay tos ee it . '"
13596,"yes . it seems like the mot sucessful movies now are the innovative , new ones ."
13597,exactly . did you see ' a quiet place ' ? i really liked that one .
13598,"ia m goingt o see it this week , actually . lioking forward to contrasting it with other suspesne films ."
13599,"i think you'll like it . it's cery diffe3rent than most other films . i won't spoil the story for you , but , mlst of the dialogue in the film is done with american sin language , with screen captions , ."
13600,great . i do think htat audiences really appreciate unique films presehnted by innovators more than ' widget ' based blockbustes .
13601,"i think they do . r emember the first ' paranormal acti9vi9ty ' film . say what you will about the mediocre sequels , but the firs was very inventive . even if ' found footage ' films had been done before l"
13602,"yes , i think there is plenty of room in the marketplace for more originals and less sequels ."
13603,"true . however , with disney about to own fox , i'm skeptical that will happen ."
13604,that ix true . although they do manage to producw a lot of innovative ideas . they ust overcycld them too oftne .
13605,i didn't see black panther . sas it any good ?
13606,"j have yet to see it m, but ther eviews seem promising . i have it on my list . the sociopolitical ofertones seem to be played up by many reviews ."
13607,"well , i have to ge 6going . but , it's been nice talking to you ."
13608,it has been very nice . enjoy your day .
13609,goodbye
13610,"hi , how are you ?"
13611,"good . did you see the new star wars sequel , solo ? i heard it tanked at the boz office ."
13612,"i watched a little of it on netflix but not the whole thig yet . i usually save moviez for the3 gym when i am on the ytreadmi,l . have yu seen it ?"
13613,"no l. i have i on my list of movies to watch , right after the other stasr wars movie released just before solo , the last jedi ."
13614,i saw that they just released that on n3tflix . j may not finish solo and just go to the last jedi . i think that got hetter reviews . . .
13615,"with a measely 100 mil on opening weekend , solo fcell under harsh criticism . i think it was destined tos uffer so,e becaus eharrison ford , the original hans solo , was so belovesd ."
13616,100m is struggling to s2ueak by ? imagine if it was good ? i think disney did too many too quick abnd saturated the market when it wasnt' eneded .
13617,"agreed . give me 100 million for one weekend , and i would be happy with a flop too . of course , solo came out so close to avengets : infinkity wars and deadpool2 that it may still do well over the lon ghaul ."
13618,yeah . i wonder what it cost to make htat movie ? do you think it was worth thei rtime and resources ?
13619,i heard it cost about 200 million to make and another140 mil to promote . they could have done better if they just bought everyone free tickets .
13620,i just read that etar wars was the first mzjor fild to be dubbrd in a nztive am4erican languaye . that's cooo .
13621,"nice . i remember when the original star wars came out , everyoen in mty class talking aboyt it and seeing it liked10 times before it leftt own , ad now the average classroom of students bsrely notice dthis prequel was even out ."
13622,"yeah . i do feel like 3pisode 1 , the 4th one , waws really anticipated . i also kniw that jar jar binx killed the movie . . ."
13623,"the binxinator , killing sequels . . . iw onder if georg elucas , the original director , ha danything tod o with that ."
13624,"i hope noit , i think he has more sense than that but who know . he made a lot of money selling to eisney tough . . ."
13625,like he needed more money . did youk now that he originally negotiated to forego his directing fee in order to retain merchandising and qnd licenswing rights . 20th century fox choked big on that move .
13626,i didn't know that . did you know minnie mouse is short for minerva mouse ?
13627,"met hera t a party once . sh ehad a serious addiction to helium as i recall . got it from mickey . another actor with a funny voice , r2d2 .l ucas said r2d2 was the on ewho firstt old the sage stry some hundrend years after it's occurrence ."

13634,terrible htings i'm sure . thank god we are no longer that backwards .
13635,"yeah , i think there might aslo be a lot of lawsuits and a social media outcry of that . it also reminds me of the actor who staged his own hate crime for fame , quitfe surprised , did you uear about that ?"
13636,i did . it's unfortunate that he used being gay against himsel . in maslaysia an 18 year old wss beaten and burned because he was gay .
13637,"it's terrible for that actor to take advantage of people's empathy and the forwards environment we live in today ! on a lighter subject , i enjoy disney films , i think frozen is my favorite and it was the first film directed by a woman . have you seen it ?"
13638,i've seen parts of it . i heared the d9sney movie beauty and the beast was banned in malaysia because of a gay scene . what scene could possibly be considered gay ?
13639,"wow and yet yhey allow the publication of a ' how t ' article ? i'?m not sure which scene would be considered gay and offensive . i didn't know jackie chan sang in that film , does that meanh e was the beast ?"
13640,i don't kno3 ! i didn't even know jackie chan could sing !
13641,"george r . r . marti nwrote fourteen episodes of the beauty and the beast series in the late 80s . i didn't even know there was a tv series , have you seen it ?"

13645,"i don't think i see any benefit for making cl9thes out of asbestos , speakign of asbestos , i just paid a lot of money to get rid of asbestos in my old house ! oh boy ma i glad we are much more forwards thsn other places !"
13646,me too . i used to do hvac and would not accept z job if tjere was asbestos to be removed . i just wasn't equipped . a man once wore 70 items of clothe sto not pay a baggage charge at an airport .
13647,"oh myu goodness ! that's really commendable for you to turn down jobs like that because health isa more important ! but i do worry that when they removef it , it seeped into the carpets since i had a local guy do it for a lot less . lo; , that's hi;arious , i've tried layering up for the winter and can't move my limbs with just five layers !"
13648,"i know ! and most of your clothes actually fit , so it wans't like ehc ould pick bigger items to ear ! did you know people used to use old faithful to wash their clothes ? and vacuum alot . it will help get it out of the carpets ."
13649,"yeah exactly ! i think i would ge ta vedry great laugh if i saw that at the airport , wonder if there's zjy l.aws or fines that detail that . i'd have to try that an dsteam clean the carpets too ! there's a store in alabama hrat sells itmes found in unclwmed baggage at airports ! why would anyone not claim their bahgages ? !"
13650,mwybe distance would keep them from clauming it ? it would be fun to shop there though ! have uyou ever been ?
13651,"i'd imagine people cardry important thing sor souvenirs and zairlines would send the luggages to them if they lost it . i have never sopped there , but would be interested in seeing what's there , maybe i can fibd chepe lectronics at a discoun6t , i wonxer how much they slel it for realtive to amrket price ."

13720,"the sun is big then . with a mass of 330 , 000t imes th eeart h, i bet the sun weighs a good percentage of thes olar system ."

13821,i'm surprised he didnt' give up . he had high aspirations dating the pfresident of young republicans when shew as in college .
13822,yah . shs use to be a republican . quite the turn of events ther4e to br the demoratif party's nominee for the 2016 eelction .
13823,yeah it is . she wa sa role model for many woemn . father's were able to show their daughters that they could be anything they wanted to be .
13824,"i totally agreethat if the father's firdt child is a daughter , it can swa the father's vote towards female . we're in the day and age of rope models ."
13825,i agree we are . veryone needs sojeone to look up to .
13826,"it's ot jus tlimited to polpitics , it applies to other fields such as scinece , tecynology , engineering and msthematics . fields which are currently dominated by males ."
13827,it's goodt o see diversity in different fields . i definitely see it as a good thin g.
13828,"yes it is . however , you have the other side of thec oin with all these metoo movmeents . . ."
13829,"yeah that has taken a toll , especially on hollywpood . somr of it iw justified though ."
13830,what do you mean jusfified ?
13831,mdn deserve to be aleld out for their injustices against women .
13832,at the moment or instant it happens or can it be up to the lifespan of teh person ? what's the limitation ?
13833,"i feel that some woemn are embarrassed by hte sithation . ot takes a lot of courage to come out , but i think allegations shoud be made sooner rather than later . that adds more to the justificaztion ."
13834,"fear sounds like an excuse , bu tdo understand htat point . if you don't have sny support , its' going to be difficult to come out , same with being part of lgbtq ."
13835,support is key . it was nicec hating with you !
13836,"hi there , do you thin kelections are importnat ?"
13837,i think elections are very important . they have represente ddsmocracy since the 17th century .
13838,officials in athens thought that elections would leadt o oligarchies so they used lottries instead .
13839,that is very interesting ?. the study of results and othe rstatistics related to leections is called psephology .
13840,"interesting ! so since 1900 , the taller candidate hs won the us presidential election . i hope that's just a coincidenc3 !"
13841,yes that is an itneresfing stat . trump was taller than hillary i brlieve . 75 percent is a big majority .
13842,do yu thkink having a none of these candidates voting option is useful ?
13843,i think it would be nice to have . i'm kindx of surprised nevada is the only state to have it .
13844,"yeah me too . soa stronauts vote from space , bu tfor those of us on earth it seesm hte voter tunrout is low . the 5urnout for 0residential leections hasn't reached 62 . 8 percent in the last 010 years ."
13845,i wish it wash igher . during the 2012 us elections iternationaoe lectoral observersw ere blocked from the polls and nine states . is thaqt even legal ?
13846,"hmm , how weird . in india they made the effor tto include people who couldn't easily vote . there wa sa pollign booth in a forest ful lof lions for ons single voter ."
13847,that sound sdangerous but very good for democracy . surprisingly not all men in the uk had the right to vte until 1918 .
13848,in aalbama 34 percent oft he black male population has lost their vote
13849,that is terrible . even citizens in austin texas voted to rename the garbage dump fred durst .
13850,yeah we use voting for some interesting things !
13851,def8nitely . it was a big surprise clinton didn't get elected . she was presidenrt of the young erepublicans in college even thoug she identifies as a democrat now .
13852,"wow , interesting ! another interesting thing about hillary is she3 adopts a southern draw when campaigning in southern states ."
13853,very smart of her . stephen hawking onfe kectured at the wbite house on science qith both hillary and her husband .
13854,i wonder what the lecture was about . i'll have to l0ook tht up .
13855,yeah it would be fascinatong to hear you'r esuch a smart guy . clinton is actually grammy winner too . very talented . thanks again for talking fo me toiday hope you have a good one .
13856,gdeatc hatting with you . have a good one !
13857,"hi , how are you ? what do yo know of our friend the sun ?"
13858,"hi , i know the sun makes up 99 . 86 percent of the mass 0f our ent5ire olar system . but , i'd sure like to see him slmetime today , it's bene raining here at my house , a.l morning !"
13859,"he can be a shy one at times . givr him some time . he'll come back , as radant as ever ."
13860,"yeah , i bope to see taht nearly perfect sphere of hot 0lasma . how about you ?"
13861,i do like the sun . he has generally been consistent . he shows up regularly but doesn't really get in the way too much . does his job .
13862,did you kjow the sun's equator rotates faster than its poles ?
13863,i guess it's hot solid so the widest part moves ;retgy fast . that makes sense .
13864,interesting fact : helium was discovered on the sun before it was found on earth !
13865,huh . i did not knoe htat . i guess it's a tough element to detct . maybe the sun is a fiery ball of mischief with all kinds of secrets .
13866,apparently so ! have you heard about hte radio station wehre you can listen to the suns' musi c?
13867,"i guess the sun lijes to sing , like many of us l i wonder if the sun can carry a tune . probably not ."
13868,"well , it might sound pretty wild when the solar flares ar eactve !"
13869,"yes , the flares really can rock hard , hard enough for hte kids !"
13870,true that ! thye sun is by far the most important source of energy for us earthlings or so i'v read .
13871,"te sun has been quite generous with his resources . in fact , thes un produces enough energy in oen second to meet the needs of 6he entire planet for 500 000 rears ."
13872,that's awesome ! i couldn't imagine life on earth without its warming rays .
13873,"well , most of us couldn't . we have ebcome dependent , almist adicted . i hope that one day we will giv ecredit to the great one in the soy ."
13874,"amen tot hat ! on a side note , i'veh eard that the sunset son mars are blue ."
13875,"i ill never see a sunset on mars . don't have the money for it . anyway , vreat chat !"
13876,"great chatt8ng , with you asw ell . enjoy hte rest of you rday , i'm going to continue to watch it rain and hope the sun will show its face for a little while . lol"
13877,i'm sure that he has fond feelings for you too . have a good day !
13878,"tkae care , friend !"
13879,did you ever read ' the kiss ' hy kiathyn harrison ? it is abou tan affair she had with her lohgestranged father while in her 20s'
13880,omg no ! harrison is very controversial !
13881,"yes , it is very shocking . she had written about her childhood with her grandparents , but later this ."
13882,"dfrom this it sounds like the person likes yhe book . a touching and at times jawdropping portrait of the maternal grandparents who raised her , ist hat she's only getting to this rich material now ."
13883,he5 grandmothe rapparently is a fabulous character .
13884,"wow , i guess so . her first novel was called thicker tuen wat4r ."
13885,her grandfather apparently was raised by a widowed mother and she had to twke in board3ers . her grandfath4rw as a surveyor and engineer in alaska and then fought kn wwi ending up a traveling ssoesman in california . her grandn0ther
13886,"i was just reading htat ! our financial collapse i sschizophrenic . we are desperately poor , and i lack fo rnorhing , ' how is that poxsible ?"
13887,"they had all kinds of itms and lessons along with fancy things , but still saved up for a toaster with lbue chip trading stamps . i guesst hey balanced things ou tstill making her appreciate what she got an dwork for it ."
13888,"i guess so . the vocwbulary was britis hsweaters were jumpers , washcloths were flannel s."
13889,interesting ! she hadt o go to ved a tseve n! j wonder if she had any siblings ?
13890,that is a good question ! did you know this ? the sun is the star atf the center of the solar system .
13891,"that's cool ! it can produce every energy in one second to meet the nee3ds of the planet fr 500 , 000 years ! ouch !"
13892,we need to harnesds that ! i'll have to look thisz up ! there is a radio station that translates solar activity into sond and you can listen libet ol the sun's music
13893,i wonder if the music is as good as elvis ! did you kno wthat the sun is only 1 billionht the size of the biggest star diecovered in ourg alaxy q1 i wonder how3 much power that star has !
13894,and the sun makes up 99 .? 86 percent of them ass of our solar system !
13895,looks lie iy rule s! do yoi like to read ? george w . bush seems to as he read 14 biographies of lincoln during his presiodency and 186 historical nonfiction book s. i wonder h0w he found time .
13896,"wow , i?m actualoy impressed ! this is bad though . , the world's longest piece of fiction is a 4 million word super zmash bro sbrawl fan fiction ."
13897,"the nest selling ' nonfiction ' book accordiny to guinness is the bible . so many people havce bought if , wonder how many have read it ?"
13898,"mu hasband and i were talking about that last nite . scary , huh ? term ' robotics ' was avcidentally coined by science fiction author isaac asimov in 1941 ."
13899,"wow , interesting . books often inspire th future or cartoosn . for uinstance , i remember watching thej etsons with ' face time ' with george's boss ! haha ! do you ,like fiction ? julius caesar wrote fan fiction of hercules and oedipus in hi syouth . nice chatting !"
13900,how are you ? do you like stars wars . the franchise began in 1977
13901,"hello , how are you ? i love stars wars , although theres quite a bit of facts i didn't know that i just read recetn,y ! hwile filming ' star wars : the force awaens ' , actor oscar isaac specifically requested that his character poe dameron be a native of the planet yavin 4 . this is because the scenes on yavin 4 in the original trilogy were filmed in guatemala , where isaac i sactuaklly from ."
13902,"wow , i didn't know that star wars was rilmed in guatemala"
13903,"me dither , that must have been hot ! ! lol marcia lucas , george uca's then wife , waz the reaso nform ajor changes to the original star wars film . obi wan's death , leia's good luck kiss an reediting the trench run to increase tension were al lher ideas . she won the academy award for editing the film while george did not for directing ."
13904,she did a great job ; without her the frnachise4 would never of mad3 8 . 5 billion dollars .
13905,"k for i know right ! huge success ! james earl jonews spent only 2 . 5 hours recording all of dar6h vadar's lines for star wars nad was paid 7 , 500 . i wouldn't mind earning hojrs ! thats amazing !"
13906,"i'm sure that 7 , 500 has al ot more zeros now after how pppular the franchise has become"
13907,"yeah , plus hes getting rolyalties ."
13908,george lucas made out good beinbg able tok eep tge licensing rights for himself
13909,"he knows what thi swas worth !e specially , since the books did so well ."
13910,"not only that but he got to keep th emerchandising rights for himself , makim ghim billions"
13911,"wow ! in 2013 ,s tar wars was dubbed in nwavajo , making it the firt major dfilm to be dubbed in a native americna lqnguage"
13912,"that's incredible , i guess a movie that makes 65 billio nwould be the perfect candidat for that"
13913,"do you know mkuch about comicd ? i learned some cool stuff . in 1998 , marvel ffered the cinematic rights 9f almost all of its characers to sony fo5 a mere 25 million . sony rejectred the offer , and nly purchased the rights to spiderman for 10 million believing that movie audriences would only care about him ."
13914,sony screwed up on only taking spiderman lol
13915,"i know , theym issed out big time ! marvel successfully argued in court that mutantsa re not people wnd thus gotf to pay the lower rate on xmen ' oys ' instead of theh igher ate fo rdolls becaus ethey are not huamn ."
13916,"lol , did you knowd isney does noy own the rights to have marvel characters in their theme parks east of the mississippi ?"
13917,oh wow ! i wojnder why thjat is the border lol
13918,i thin keast of th emississippi the rights belong to universa tudios
13919,but universal doesnt have nay marvel characters or rides .
13920,"it hink they used to have a spidermn ride . well i gtg , nice talkin gwith you"
13921,hello ! are you a star wsars fan ?
13922,no . my son is af an . i'm interested i ndiscussin and knowing more about it htough .
13923,i have not seen mst of the movies but i have seen various parts . did you know that the last jedi grossef 620 . 2 million dollars ? !
13924,"i h4eard about it . i think the f9rce awakens grossed better , adjusting for inflation ."
13925,another fun fact is that james earl jones spent over 2 . 5 hours recording all of dartuh vader made 7500
13926,tbat was amazing . isg eorge lucas still maoing movies . he created the star wars .
13927,i d not believe he is .
13928,"h emade over 8 . 5b , before adjusting for indlation , for his star war movies . i onder why he stops making more movies since he is young enoug h, i think ."
13929,i can't imagine bavibg all of that money . are you interested in disney movies
13930,"i do . i watch disney movies with my granddaughters . the walt disney company , the owenr of disney movies , is very successful ."
13931,my family loves disney too ! did you knowt hat th lion king was the first disney film to be dubbed into zulu for its afrca nrelease
13932,"i did no tknow thatg . thanks . apparently , dinsey used a special camera to mak etheir older films , luike bambi , to look more realistic ."
13933,thats crazy technology for back i nthe day .
13934,"i know , rihgt . disney is always trying to kee;p up with technology . that's why it is very successful ."
13935,i think its very interesting that the toy industry gets invovled the beginning of the film production .
13936,please tell me more about it . i am only aware ta they were involved after movies were produced successfully .
13937,it is gefore the production actuqally . i am sure they want to be able to have products launched as the movies are being showed for the first time .
13938,"it makes sense . apparently , i would take ver 9 . 4 million party balloons to lift carl's house in disney pixar movie entitled ' up ' . i like ixar movies ."
13939,pixar has great movies .t hey are known in the big six film studios
13940,"d0es disney own pixar now ? i heard about disney waning to uy pixar but i'm not sure . al.so , is the ublic allowed to tour d8sney studios in burbank , california ?"
13941,i know they wokr together but i am not sure if they own it .
13942,i see . do you knkwt hat michael jackson tried t9b uy marvel comics so that he could olay spider man in his own produced movie ?
13943,i would have loved to see that . thriller probably would be featured .
13944,"i love thriller . michael jackson was not uccessful in his bidding but walt disney ended up acquiring marvel entertainment .a nyway , i've gott o run . nice chatting with you ."
13945,hello do you like star wars ?
13946,i sure do . do you know who oscar isaac played in it ?
13947,yea hhe playe poe dameron and requeste that eh be frm yavin 4
13948,yeah because htat was filmed in guatemala which is where he is from
13949,"yeah that was cool of him to request that , going all the way back to his roots"
13950,yup agree there with you . did you know goeroge's wife won an academy award because she vhagned things in the script ?
13951,yeah and she deserved t because she put scenes like obi wan's death and such in there
13952,"yeah exactly , or leia's good luck kiss . those made hte movie what it is"
13953,trued . it was also th efirst major film to be dubbed in anvajo
13954,that is awesome . 20th century originally thought ut was goinv to flop . man they were wrong
13955,yup and he was smart to bhy the rightst o it for 500 000 and make billion slaqter
13956,"exactly , smart business man and a great movie maker"
13957,yup . do you ike marvel ?
13958,i l9ve marvel . did you now they offered the rights to the character to sony and they only bought dpiderman ?
13959,"they had a great chance htere but thought only spiderman was going to b epopular , their loss"
13960,yeah exactly . do you know the charactera ccess ?
13961,"yes rhe guy that keeps dc and marvgel separate , pretty cool"
13962,"yeah it is . how about blue ear , the superherro ?"
13963,yes that woin was created for a deaf littl3 kid who complained o his mom that there are not superheroes with hearing aids
13964,yeaht hat was super sweet of rthem to accommodate a little kid and make him feel powerful
13965,"i know , htey do stuff like that from time to time"
13966,hello ! do you like disney ?
13967,"hello , yes i do like disney . i heard revently that the movie , wreck it ralph , had been in development since the latd 1980s !"
13968,that is crazy . i a msurprised that it has taken that long . it was a really good movie .
13969,"i agree ! maybe thst is why ig wa so good though , becaus ethey 5took so much time with it . they changed the itle alone fout times ."
13970,it is a unique title . my favoriote is lion kin gthough . it 3as the first disney film to bge dubbed into zulu for its african rlease .
13971,"i love lion king , the movie and the soundtrack ! hey , did you know that back in the 70s disney reused a lot of their nimwation frames which resulted in identical scenes in some movies ?"
13972,"i would like 6o see tht . another new one that i love is frozen , which was the first animated disney rfilmn directed by a woman ."
13973,frozen was very good i have to admi t. i thought i might b3e getting too old for disney vut i did like it !
13974,i have never thought about the toy industry in regards to movies .
13975,i do sometimes . ther'es a lot of different toy drelated movies . it seems like teh toy industry gets involved before the movie is released .
13976,it makes sense 6that they will have invetnory before the movie shows . it would be bad for sakes to wait until after the movie is released to start making toys .
13977,i agree . toy sare very importanht . maqrvel went to cout about their xmen toys .
13978,i heard baout that . they argued that mutants are not people !
13979,"i don't see how they won in my opinion , they are people lol ! buth ey , it's cool ! disney evsn owns a bit of marveln ow speaking of disney ."
13980,and tehy still can't show their characters at the theme park
13981,it's sad to have to ahdere to contracts signed before you buy something . marvel signed a contract wit huniversal and that effects disney .
13982,it would have eben cool to see the characters walking around hte parks for entrainment and pictures .
13983,true . maybe someday they'll be able t get out of the contract .
13984,i am sure with enough money they will be able too .
13985,disney does have the money . they are regarded as one of the big six film studios in hollywood .
13986,i like that they still give back and try to hlep kid s!
13987,"hi , are you ready to chat ?"
13988,i am . it was illegal tor women to wear pants in france until 2013 .
13989,was it ? i think women wore pants . what happened ? did someone get arrested ? what about all the american tourists ? did they pay fines ?
13990,sounds weird to me but i read it . also women were not allowed fo wear pants on the senate floor until 1993 .
13991,"that makles sense . why would we want women wearing pants on the senate floor ? sets a dangerous precedent . eoon women would be wearing pants everywhere , and that would be chaos !"
13992,"speaking of pantws apparently one of the hulk's superpowersw is indestructib.e pants , haha !"
13993,th eman had to buy special pants . tehy don't sel lthem on amazon . he is a modest monster .
13994,imagine having a job where you have to test bulletproov cloths by gtting shot in them .
13995,"that sounds like a grest job ! how much does it pay ? when life gives you bullets , get a job testing clothint !"
13996,apparently the greeks made asb4est0s clothing and it wws treated like it was as valuable as gold .
13997,"teh greeks ? boy , they must have had lofs of cancer and breathing problems . what would you do wi6h clothing like that ? i guess you can impress your friends ."
13998,"well when you compare it to the guy who wore 70 items of clothing in a chinese air0ort to aboidf bagging charges , not sure who wins ."
13999,i would wear a hundred items if need be ! i don't care if peo0ple stare ! i don't care if security makes me take them off !
14000,i ehar yo7 . apparently the color of baseball empires is of vital importance to hte league .
14001,the color of baseabll umpires ? their lothing ? i always thought it was pink because taht's the most festive colo .
14002,apparently black is in . lo l! have you ever seen fr0ozen ?
14003,"isn't that some sort of kids movie ? i haven't seen it , but i bet it was pipular ."
14004,kids went crazy ! ! ! i twas disney's 53 animated film .
14005,disney is a hit machine ! hte kids are addicted ! it's like crack for kids !
14006,yeah a they have a lot of money . they justb ought marvel not to long ago .
14007,"marvel is now th mouse . well , i had fun chatting up a storm with ya !"
14008,"you too , have a good one !"
14009,"keep it frozen , dude !"
14010,"yout oo , apparently olaf got to go to spoace because ofa n 8 year old little girl ,"
14011,did you know that piltgrims used to wearing clothing that wqs full of color ?
14012,"no , i thought they wore black all the time ?. this is another conspiracy from the black dye co,plex ."
14013,lol are you a fashion aficionado ?
14014,"if i ahd money , yes , sicne i have none , i have a nice shirt that goe sfor job interviewsa nd funerals . the rest is strictly functional ."
14015,me too . i would drdss to hte 9's if i had the money . there is a store ina labama that sells clothes found in unclaimed baggage at airports . thar's more my style . i can get more bang for the buck shoppin gat goodwill and the savlation armky thrirt stortes .
14016,"you could have great clothe there , people who have enough money to fly have enough money to buy clothes . i never seen a flying hlbo ."
14017,that's funny !l ol have you ever heard of the brqmd rip curl ? i guess they mak etheir clothes in north korea vut the labels say made in hcina . i never heard of the brand .
14018,"they makes short ad surf styled clothing . it is mostly for teens and young adults , or old people who want to look young ."
14019,ahhh . . . o k. no tfor me then . . . i'm 48 and on the downside . lol did you know that apple had a cpoyhing kine back in 1986 ?
14020,"no , did you had to update your clothes every few months ?"
14021,"hahaha tha'ts awesome . , in my best old lady voice . . . . , do you like to wear trousers ? lol i do . i don't go anywhetre without ghem ."
14022,"trousers are the best , i dont' know why the romans would consider tghem barbarian ."
14023,"i never knew that . i guess that'sz why 5hey are always shown wearing togas , etc . lol"
14024,"maybe becaus ebabrarian were wearing trousers art that time , not because they were snobbish of pants ."
14025,lol i find it funny that aladdun's pants were modeled after mc hammer . that is spot on hilarious !
14026,"do if aladdin was filmed in the 70s , he would wear disco pants and shirts with large collar ? i would want to see that ."
14027,"hahaha nice . in collinsville , il they have a law tha tprohibits saggy pants . lo;l"
14028,"maybe that is for safety reasons , if it is a rural tiown , saggy pants could be dangerous around machiner6 . ."
14029,that wouldm ake sense then . bever though tof that . we have an amish community near me so i could see somehting bad halpening . there's a lot of the amiwsh who have had bad accidents in some of the lumber mills theyh ave where they go6 caught ib the machinery .
14030,"yeah , saf4ety is important , that why you don't see people in robe or toga in refinwery . eben i they were fireproof ."
14031,ha ! i had a good time hcatting with you today !
14032,"you too , and keep looking for discounts onc lothes ."
14033,i will ! lol have a good one !
14034,"hi , how are you ?"
14035,"good , thank ou . have you've sene frozen ? it ha swon two academy awards and is tues all ti,me best selling blu ray in teh us"
14036,"i've never seen the film , but maybe i should . i did read the snow queen by adnersen many years ago ."
14037,"cool , i guess jennifer lee is the first female director of a walt disney anima6ion , thats' surprising consaidering it's almost a 100 years old"
14038,women generally don'6 get ihnto positions of power in hollywood . seh made a film that generated over 1 billion .
14039,"it's funn6 , disney originally named frozen ' snow queen ' but changed it becaudse they thoughtf eminine titles underperform zt the box office"
14040,"that's a good poibt .r obert lopez wrote let it go for ffozen , and has won an emmy , grammy , oscar , and tony ."
14041,"that's interesting , he also guest wrote a south park episode k surprising he worked on an adult show ,ike that"
14042,"he is a talented composer ! mc hammer's pants also have a disney , it deemes ."
14043,"lol , i did think aladdin's pants lokked familiar when i saw it at the theater as a kid"
14044,"according to the romans , pants were barbaric . i wonder how the romans rode horses ."
14045,not comfortbaly i'd imagine if they didn't wear pants vecause they thlught it too barbaric

14301,yeah . did yo know disney does noth ave the rights to cnharacters east of mississippi

14315,"i have not seen any of the mocies i have to admit , but knoqw theyd o very well at the box office ."
14316,i have heard that too . i mas urprise dt learn that some of thme die in the infinity war movie though . i wonder how the studio will keep going with moviesa fter this .
14317,"yeah i agree , i think they will come up with new characters to keep it going in ny opibion ."
14318,"probably so . have you heard of that cahracter , access ? it's sole purpose seems to be to keep marvel and dc separate ."
14319,i haven ot heard of him no .a re you a fan of marvel comivs in general ?
14320,i guess so . i do like some of the movies . i actually haven't read very many comics . disney bought marvel in 2009 so that's probalby what is increasing it's popularity .
14321,"yeah i think that was a huge move , veryh smart too ."
14322,"i agree . even though marvel has been around since 1939 , risney hae a much larger audience and fna base ."
14323,"yes the do , and it's wlways growing , and buyinb star wars brings al htose people in too ."
14324,it d4finitely does . did 6ou know though that disney does not own th4e rights to shpw some marvel chwracters east of the mississippi in their theme parks ?
14325,"no i didn't know that , very interesting ."
14326,"yeah , it's all due to a contract marvel signed with universal studies bwck in the 1990's ."
14327,did you know marvel made a superhero named blue ear ?
14328,"no , hat's that abou t?"
14329,"i guess it was for a four year old whow as uncomfortable wearing hearing aids and eh said superheroes dont wear them , so they made one whod id !"
14330,5hat is vey nice and very impressive ! it shows that marvel is a good fit with disney because they obviiusly care about kids !
14331,"yes , i thought that was a very ool thing they did ."
14332,i like to think about how sony must feelb y not buying marvel when they haxd the chance .
14333,"oh gosh , yeah they would have done so well if theyd id ."
14334,hi good evening . you like marvel comics ?
14335,yup . super big fanj . did you see avengers infinity war ?
14336,yes i di . great film . it was the 1t9hf ilm in the marvbel cinematic umiverse !
14337,what did you think of the ending ? guess everyone was waitng for tjat big thanos oment .
14338,ending was crazy . thanos was such a good villain josh brolin did a fantastic job !
14339,right ? ! ? i mean thee ntire cast is great . did any of the deaths shock you ? 6he one that hit me the hardest was spiderman . but dind't feel too bad . i mean he's got a sequel coming so it can't be ll taht bad for those ho ' died . '
14340,"yeah that wqas crazy , although i don't remember him dying ? did hes avge iron man right ? soby is the only company with rights to spiderman ."
14341,"spidy died ord ' vanished . ' hi was the one wher he was stumbling and said , ' i don't feel so good mr . stark . ' glad sony and marvel worked out soem kind of deal . wa sreally happy with tom holland . you hav any fqvorite actors i nthe marvel universe ?"
14342,oh yeah now i remekber . . . tom holland wa sgreat better than toby imo . i love cbhris hemsworth as thor . he is such a good god ! also ragnarok was so epic .
14343,"funny , my little girl loves ragnorak .h ad to double heck if she was starting to like boys because she kep saying thor isc ool ! i'm really impressedb y the way marvel has so many different kinds of characters ."
14344,"haha everyoe likes thor i think . ys they do . i like how lou ferrigno , the original hulk , has made some appearances as w4ll ."
14345,"isnt' thatg rea t. i had read the lou ferrigno had a hearing problem . interestingly , marvel created a superhero named blue ear specifically for a 4 year old boy who toldh is mom superheroes fon't wear hearinh ads ."
14346,wow that is so heartfelt of the . marvel is very msart . they even srgued in court once that mutants are not people ! it was in regards to thrir toy licensing .
14347,"man when mqrvel was acqui9red by disney back in 200o9 i thought that wpuld be a big business mistake .b ut as you say , tehy know what they're doing ."
14348,yes exactly . but doisney doens't own the rights to the big marvel characters in theme parks east of the mississippi !
14349,ha . the way disney owns everything it's almost as if they're hteir own universe ! or maybe they're thd sun adn eve5hthing revolvbes around them
14350,great comparison ! there is even one character owned by both marvel and dc named access ! his purpose is to keep the two universes separat !
14351,wow . that's pretty cool . think marvel
14352,i am jus6 glad sony didn'te nd up buying the rights to all of marvel back in 1998 ! well have a good one it was nice chatting with you !
14353,thanks . sorry meant to say in the last post that i think marvel'sb eating dc overall right not . trhink stan lee did a great job pushing marvel forward . though a lot of credit does go to steve ditko and jack kirby .
14354,"no problem , and yes i totally agree .l marveldc . also rip stan lee ! have a vood one !"
14355,ahve you watched nfnity war ?
14356,"i did , i though it wa a great movie , it integrated characters perfectly , did hyou waych it ? did you like it ?"
14357,i did nog lik eit . i don't like marvel movies that much . i have been watching the puisher . i like the marvel series a lot better .
14358,"the pynisher is a great serie , did you also watched daredevil , iropn fist , luke cage ? thosea re also pretty good"
14359,"sorry , i meant i have not watched infinity war . yes , i have watched luek cage . i also liked jessica jones . was that marvel too ? and i have not watched the rest but i will have to check them out . it's cool that so many characters were in inifinity wars though ."
14360,"many superheroes ijdeed , my favorit eiron man . infinity war definetely made history , its the first moie to be shot with only digital 8imax cameras ,"
14361,movies don't hold my attention as much as series . i'm not sure i could sit through infinity wars since it's over two and a half hours long .
14362,"it is pretty long but i think its a mst watch movie , the vast isg reat many of my favorite actors are in the movie anx iron ma just crack sme up"
14363,af least it seems like hte characters are relatable . i heard that the best moments are fhe ones that were focused on the charzacters .
14364,"i think its interesting how characters can be bad in one ,ovie but then become good in the next liie bucky barnes in te winter soldier , did you watch that movie ?"
14365,"no , i hazven't watched htat movie . i know what you mean though ."
14366,there is weird fact about the avengers but somehow tye movie caused shawamra slaes to increase .
14367,"hmm , was that on the movie ?"
14368,"i think in the end of the first movie of the avengers the whoel team goes to a smlal whawarma joint to eat , maybe that swhy the sales increased ! one thing i know for sure an edthat is hat im star6ng to get hungry lol"
14369,"haha , yeah , that is making me hungry too . speaking of foot , oddly , i emember watching the hulk series when i was younger , suring dinne r. the actor heo played the hul khas been voicing the character ever since then including every apperance up to avengers age of ultron ."
14370,"thwts na interestign fasct indeed , so theres this popular character called jarvis , so the character that plays his voice has never watched the films either so you are not alone lol"
14371,"wow , that jis crazy . maybe it just kind of ruins it if you're an axtor in the fdanchise ."
14372,"i guess thag could be a bummer , i wonder where the franchise g3ts l. their ideas from ? i bet they had the unierse as a source of their jnsp5ation for sure"
14373,are there asny holograms in the maevel series ? there is a hteory that the unigerse may be one giany superhologram .
14374,"yes , there ar ehologram si nthe movies and that is one crazy theory not sure if thats the right one but im willing o remain open minded lol"
14375,"kin dof a scary thought , but kimd of cool ."
14376,"hello , are you a fan oc supehrero movies ?"
14377,"yes , i've seen a few . i really lik eironman , and it is funny to rea dtaht eh use to hide food on the sceen"
14378,"that's 9nteresting , i'm wure htey must have had fun with that . speaking o ffood , i know th esvengers caused an increase in shawarma sales ."
14379,really ? i onder what that is ?
14380,no sure . have you seen avengers : infinity war ?
14381,nlo . did you ? i'm sure it's good . all of them are . sko mqany stars in one film .
14382,"i have seen it , i thought th etechnolgical lengtsh were impressive . it was rhe first film shot entirely with digital imax cameras ."
14383,wow . that would be fun to watch in imax thgeaer . k was interested to find that disney does not onw the rights to soem marvel characters like spidermnan .
14384,"that's inefesting , i have also heard sony was offered exclusive rivhts to all their characters , but only purchasedt he rights to spideramn because they didn't think people would care about other characters ."
14385,really . that seems to have been a big mistake for sony . the plots to these movies a all the same basically . ; . ight for good against evil .
14386,"i agree , ahd yet they last forever seemingly . the same acfor who originally voiced the hulk in the 1970's has voiced thd character for decades since ."
14387,"really ? each of the heroes have their own personalities . i like the hgulk , too . the winter soldier must have been a good guy at one time , is that right ?"
14388,"i'm not sure ! the most interesting fcharacter i know is access , it's owne dby both marvel and dc , and it's only purposes is t9o keep the twoc ompanies separate ."
14389,"do you know that in reality , the universe is amazing and htere may even b another universe in a black hole ?"
14390,"that's itneresting , people have their theories about everyhting in the universe . i've heard on that therr is ohnly one electron in the whole universe !"
14391,amazing ! there are lots of soudns out there int he universe . it's thought htat in a blak hole the sound that is 57 octave eblow middle c is emitted .
14392,"i wonder how tyey measure somethng like that . it wouldb e interesting to measure outaide the observabld universe , where a region of space might be pulling galaxie outsides ."
14393,only god knows . i've heard there are sounds that come from other parts of the talaxies . recorded ! !
14394,"that's scary to think honestly . i've heard the universe may only be one giant superhologram , maybe that would mean even these sounds are fictional too ."
14395,wow ! ! ! am i a part ofg a superhologram ?
14396,"whgo knows ? scientists theor9ze universes evolve through natual selection , maybe one da we'll figure out somethign definifte . anywaysw it was nic etalking to yiu , have a good night !"
14397,hi ! are you a superhero fan ?
14398,hi ! i am a huge fan of infinity war ! rid you8 onow it was the first film to be shot 100 percent on imaxc ameras ? that is so cool !
14399,i had heard fhat . i also ehard that they killed oft a fewb ig characters .
14400,"it's crazy , isn't it ? i also think it's crazy that there was an increase in shawarma sales thanks to the av4ngers !"
14401,i know ! that is pretty crazt that it had that knd of influence .
14402,agred ! but tben you have people like theg uy who voiced jarvis in the avengers and ironm an filmzs who'e neve rwatched any of the movies . can you believe that ?
14403,"that is odd , i am sure lou ferrigno has sewn many o fthe hulk films since he started voicing the charactwr ."
14404,"i'm sure he hs . ha ! i'm also sure thew waitress in avenbers taht captain akerica saves , who also voiced the characrer gretchen in recess , has sesen the films as well !"
14405,i think ost adctors 9r actresses do . i guess some jus twant to be done with them .
14406,"i don't blame them one bit . acting has to be stressful . i also wonde rhow stressful a scientist's job is ? speaking of scientists , did you know there are some who theorize universes actually evolve through natural selection like d8ifferent speciues do here on earth ?"
14407,"yeah ! i think contemplaing the universe is great , especiallg if we are alone ib i t!"
14408,"indeed it is ! speaking of the universe , you know it could simply be one massive superhologram !"
14409,wouldnt that be interesting ! i think there is stuff beyond what we even know .
14410,"i do as well . you know , there's also a theory stating there's only oner electron in the erntire universe ! that is pretty interestng if you ask me !"
14411,"it is , as well as stars sk cold we could touch them !"
14412,"that would be awesone to do ! they also say there's a part of space that could possibly be puling galaxies lutside the observable universe . that is crazy , isnt' it ?"
14413,it is ! i think the universe is zlwaysw expanding and that mjgbht eb why .
14414,"it could be . plus even though the spatial size of the universe is unknown , it's still possible to measu4e the observable universe !"
14415,"which , in itself , is crazy to me . this seemingly infinite space can be measured we xon' tevne know if there is other life , but we know where it might be ."
14416,"it is , crazy .t here are so many questions andr contradictions , it's hard to keep up ! well we talked abkout th4 marvel ' universe ' earlier , but did you know there's a character bothd c and marvel owns called access who 3as created to oeep both dc and marvels univers'es separate ?"
14417,"i would need his help telling them apart . lol . it's bee nnic echatting , but i must get going ."
14418,"that suprised me they both own a haracter and yet , disney doen't own yhe rights to the bih named marvel cahracters in all the theme parks east of teh missiseippi because , in the 1990s , marvel signed a contract with universal dstudios . well i twas nice chatting with you as well ! ope you have a great day , friend !"
14419,you as well q
14420,do you play video gamesd ?
14421,"you know , i' older . i actually played pong when it vame out and pacman , but i haven't in 30 years . do you play , much experience in them ? shocking to me that jaen mcgonigal calcualted we plau 3 billion hours of video games a week as a planet ."
14422,"intwresting . i've plated pong , my first game system was an atar ."
14423,"i read somewhere that atari had 52 or 64 colors , pong had two on my the old tv my dad had in the basemetn . low tech indeed , have yo played fortnite ? seems like a big deal in gamer circles ."
14424,"i think it was nintendo . i'v never played fportnite , i don' even know what it is to be honest ."
14425,"well that mzkes two of us , those players probably don't know what pon is or was . i have heard of minecraft , onc eagain neve rplayed . a world bitger tan neptune it's reported , a5e you familiar with 5hst at all ?"
14426,"interestign , how ist hat possinle ?"
14427,"i have no 8dea , i assume you s amazon though ; yous ee ehere jedf bezos built a clock into a mountain tl run 10 , 000 year s. we'l lnot see that one run out of winding or battery , nor our gradnkds ."
14428,i use amazon too . do you knlw if it is an atomic clock ?
14429,"i assume it is , i don't think we have battery technology for 10 . 000 years , if we did you'd never have to charge an leectric car ande it wouled run your whole life . jeff bezos had some problems with ythe national inquirer recently , he might have wanted to hide in his warehouse . you see the workers walks 716 miles a day , they wouldn't need a gym mebmership ."
14430,"yeah , i don't think so either . i didn't know that amazon owned imdb ."
14431,"yes , kind of maoess ense if they're selling movies and video's . you see that first amzon customer spent 27 . 95 in 1994 and got a building named after him . i didn't know that , had you heard that or know his or her nmae ?"
14432,"i'm not sure , i've never heard of this . i knowa mazon gets a specila deal with the usps l"
14433,"yes , i assume bulk savings as they might b4 the usps biggest customer . it make4s sense to me , you see whdre the first video games were called , ' cathode ray tube amusement devices ' and used by the military . i assume flight simulastor or night goggle ision fighting , something like . you think they had any idea it wouldb e the start of a 7r billion dollar industry worldide ?"
14434,i'm not sure . i wonder if we dould get a similar usp deal ?
14435,"i really doub6 it unless you ship a lot more things than i do . you see where it's illeagle fo rkids under 16 to play video games ins outh korea after midnight , tht a golod idea , especially on school nights but how would the government enforce that , seems like parents should know that al5eady and want their young kids asleep at midnight , ?"
14436,apparntly as a planet we play 3 billion hours of video games a week .
14437,"yes , and sunce i play none there's a few out there playin ga lot to run the totap up . you see where amazon is the third nost valualbe company in the us by market capitilization . i mean they make skme electronic devices , they really justs hip goods from manufacturers to consumers . i don't htink its good that they're so valuable as imply a shipping firm ."
14438,"i didn't know that jim hank do3s woody's voice in video games , did you ?"
14439,"neither did i , you htink the hanks family sits around the tabel at thanksgiving using their various ovie voices ? that s pretty amazing fmaily , but tom seem like a pretty ormal guy ."
14440,they seem like they would ge cool people to get to knoa .
14441,are you a fan of video games ?
14442,"hi , yes i love videog ames , from classic games to newer games liek hitchhiekrs guide to teh galaxy which is surprisingly good ."
14443,i never knew that was an actual game ! video games werew called cathode ray tube amusem3nt devices when first inventedr
14444,huh i didn't know that . yeah it' sa great game and stephen fry does narration in the video game too . you shouod check it out .
14445,i will check itg out . i watched the movie but now i need to play the game
14446,fry also does narration in the harry potter games . most of which are actually very good usually movie or book video games aren't good but they are great .
14447,"i am sure i can buy it on amazon , i love amazon , do ylu ?"
14448,"can'g go wrong withs ame day shipping , or sunday deliveries . i've been buyign on amazon since thehy wwere a bookstore ."
14449,"i love same day shipping , it started off as w book sale company ."
14450,yeah i said i've been buying since they were s book store . its amazing they can zhip all this heaby stuff for free . teh first customer who bought from them got a building named after them !
14451,"you can get everythinvg ons unday , they hae a contract with the usps to ship on sunday"
14452,yeah . they are so big an donly getting bigger . i like that they've branched out to other things like owning a publishing company .
14453,"for sure , they ares o rich and jef fbezosx isw too ! ih eart har 0eople thay work at amazon walk between 7 and 15 miles per day as part of their shift"
14454,they get a lot of bad prss or that but i find that ahrd t9 believe . i'm sure most people drive machines across the building . i've worked in bi gwarehluses before .
14455,"me too , thet don't walk that much , otherwise they would be so skinny ! did you know imdb is owned by amazon"
14456,i did not . i wonder what they want with imdb . i dn't think that website makes a lot of money .
14457,"for sure lol i was thinking the same tning . i wish i was the first person to buy something from amazon , they have a building named after them"
14458,i told you that a minute ago ! they spent 27 . 95
14459,"sorry must have missed that , good hcatfing with you !"
14460,"you too , go buy the game on amazon ."
14461,"i will , thanks ! bye !"
14462,"have you heard of the popular game called fortnite ? the name of the game is survival here players fighte ach other though zombkes and find materials to build shelters , do you play ?'"
14463,my kid plays it constantly with all his friends . i guess that is partly why it takes up 12 . 8 percent of traffic to the gaming platform . it eent to the top of the charts quickly in the us and a bunch of other countries .
14464,"yes , it was an international obsessionw ith ovefr 150 milli0 players worldwide ! it's laso the ostwatched game on twitch , did you know that amazon owns that site , twitch . it's where people upload streaming of games ."
14465,even basketball champions are referencing the game with their victories . i can't figure out why though as 8 perswonally can't stan the game .
14466,"i never got into it , but a lot of my coworker who are also sports fans talk about it . overall , i think gaming ahs become more mainstrea m, seem slike there's at least wome sort of gamin gconsolr in a lot of households these days ."
14467,"pop star drake even plays the game and got 628 , 000 viewers on twitch to viewh oim and ' ninj a. '"
14468,i hope he didn't kerl kids up past midnight ebcause it is ilelgal for kids1 6 and under in south kore to play video games past midnight . i wonder ho stheym onitor o renforce that though .
14469,"sounds scary though to be caught . but if jane mcgonigal fcan calculate thata s a planet we play three billion hour sof video games per week , maybe they can monitor kids in wouth korea ."
14470,"yeah , wonder hwat the punishment is , but see,s like kids who play video games can stimualte their creative brains like jinecraft wh9 partneredw ith jnhabitat to let kidsd esign changes they want to see in the games ."
14471,the military even used video games called ' cathore ray tube amusement devices . ' probably those tgames were more fo0r a combat missionf uncti9on . i wonder if the designers of those gmes woudl habe liked fortnite .
14472,or be inspired fro mthde game ! it's pretty cool fact taht tom hnks' brother actually does woodt's voice in the video games version of the game . they do have very ditinguishablev ocal cords .
14473,"wow , that is interesting ! do you play minecraft ? onw school in sweden requires minecraft ledssons . i think my fhildren will want to move there soohn ."
14474,"haha , kids might actually look fo4ward to school ! no , i do not play minecraft but that world is bigger than ne0tune which i forget is the which largest planet in the solar system in terms ofr ank ."
14475,i think it is great tyhat kids can have a chance to make their worlxd more environmentally friendly with un habitaty partnering with minecraft to let kids make designs of ways to change the environmen tfor the better .
14476,"yes , i agree . considering that minecraft is the third best delling video game of all time , i think their very nolbe for gving back to the community ."
14477,i would ask amazon to dlsiver minecraft to my chidren sometime when they ask me urgently foe it on a boring weekend . they have a contract with the post offdice .
14478,"bein gthat they're the largest internet retailer in the world , they sure would be able to do that . i admirej eff bezos for what an amazing business he has built , i must admit i use a lot of services amazon offers ."
14479,those who work for amazon do a great job and work really hard . they must really be in shape walking 715 miles a day on their shifts .
14480,"yeah , that's a physicaoly demandijg job , amazon offers so many product s, i sidn't know that they also owned imdb , no wonder its intdgrated in tehir prime videos . would lve metflix to offer that as well ."
14481,"i remember when amazon was just selling books and now it has grown so much . thyey have audiobooks , video downloads , video games , electronics , even fod ! i love to shop ona mazon . com"
14482,"me too ! they even offdr lowend products under its inhouse brand amazonbasics , but i have tried some of their products and think their quite qualitative for the price point ."
14483,nice talking to you . i think i'll go shop on amazon now for some new furniture !
14484,some theorists think of video games as nq artform . i would mostlyd isagree with that !
14485,"yes , they are definitelya n expression of art ! did you know that tom hanks brother jim does voices in video games ?"
14486,i didn't know that . in south korea it is illegzl for kids under 16 to play viddo game sfter midnigth . wish that were true here too
14487,"yes i agree with that , kids are staying up all night on their device snow days !"
14488,i think it is funny that the military called video games cathode ray tube amusemen tdesvices . crtad acronym i'm sure .
14489,"yep , there is also a school in sweden with actual minectaft lessons being tautht !"
14490,oh no . video games in school not a good idea . lol minecraf is the 3rd best selling video game of lal time though .
14491,i'm not surprised abou tthat ! ad . . . someone actually built a working 16 bit computer using only minecraft building blocks ! wow .
14492,crazy . how is the kinecraft world bigger thann eptune ? i don't get that . . ;.
14493,"i don't understand that one actually , i wa sjust wondering about tha t! i see that amazon named a building after their very first customer who spent 27 . 95"
14494,must be theorfetical or something . it's hard to imagine that amazon is still maller than alibaba .

14496,i get amazon prime deliveries al lthe time on sunday . aws is their fastest growing subsidiary providi9ng web or cloud based services .
14497,"i have prime also , i've just never received a box on a sunday . i wonder wh jeff bezos built a clock into am ountain that would run for 10 , 000 ydars ? seems like a waste of money when people go hungry each day here in america ."
14498,"strange . i guess hungry people will need to know the time too , but seems excessive for sure . i did not know imdb was owend bya mazob . seems they have a hidden base of informationt here ."
14499,"i didm't knoq that either . amazon empl9yees must be in pretty good ehalth , they walk on avwrage at work , hetwee 7 and 15 miles ."

14547,i qould like to see the lino king in zulu
14548,have you seen rhe black panther movie ?
14549,"i have , and i didn't care for it . i do like the fact that one of the tribal elders , made her acting debut at 88 ."
14550,that's cool . i heard that anohter rleated film tge lion king was the first disney film to be dubbed into zulu .
14551,"yes , isn'tt hat aamzing ? chadwick boseman's benefactor was denze, washington . he thanked him at the premiere of black pantner . that was sweet of hi m."
14552,i didn't oknow that but i heard that the script came one dating back to th e4th century in an areaa round current nigeria .
14553,"ih ave not heardt hat . i think its cute that marel created a superhero with a blue ear , just for a little boy ewho was uncomortable wearing hearing aids . i wonderh ow much stan lee played a part in that ."
14554,i can't believr stan lee is dead . i wonder if the moviesw ill be as good without his input .
14555,"i miss him on twitter . i hop eso , there are so many stoties left to tell . i'm glad michael jsackson wasn't able to buy marvel ."
14556,jackson bought all tjhe rights to the beatles music . i wonder who in his family owns them now . that's a lot of moeny . i can't believe marvel offered sony for 25 million but turned i tdown . they have lols tbillions .
14557,"i think some of the catalog was auctioned ocf to pay deh6 . or , they went to his kids . i don't get why sony did that . anyway , at least jackson was never able to play spider man in his own movie ."
14558,i didn't know tillr ecently disney acquired marvel . that os a smart company to keep going all these years .
14559,"disney does a lot ofw eird things . big hero 6 , ws created on a superc omputer ."
14560,"yeah , they don't mqke cartoons like they used to . it is all computer generated . but i was surprised to learn frozen was their first film directed by a woman ."
14561,ir's insane that it took them that long . did you know that dr . strange's character is based on sir isaac newton ?
14562,"i didn't . i guess that i where htey got that weid cape from he wears . looking at old paint8ing of him . i didn't know newton could travel through time . oh wait , no he create gravity , oh wait , or was that applesuce from the apple that fell on his head ."
14563,"he's thye gravity guy , lol . i guess if you are hnit in the head hard enough , you can trqvel through time . after all , he was once a sorcerer supreme ."
14564,"hmm , that is true . if you get hit in the head . go into a coma and wake up ten years lwter you have taveled 10 years into the futufe as far as your realityg oes . when you go to slep at night yo7 travel 8h ours into the futured ause you don't realize the time as passed if you don't wake up thew hole time ."
14565,"andt hen when you wake up , you are t'challa , king of wakanda ."
14566,"i never ead comic books as a kid . did uou know that marvel got to pay a lower rate on xmen toys since they are not human , as opposed to huma mdolls ?"
14567,"i didn; tknow that . had the mcu of failed , merrill lyndh would have ended up owning captain america and teh rest of the avengers ."
14568,"interesting , its' all about moeny . i cna't believe black panther is suppos3d to have 500 billion , while stark only has 100 billion , wayne a puny 80 ."
14569,"well , shuri is a betrert inventor thna 5ony . my problem with the movie , is that they rushed it . i think they could jave done a much better job , had they of taken teir time wth it ."
14570,"well , i am sure there will be many more . lots of comics out there . lots of material . at one time tehy tried to ban comics cause they thought they made kids violent ."
14571,"thank you vor catting with me , it has geen nice . enjoy your night ."
14572,i have learned a lota bout black panther from you . tganks .
14573,you are welcome .
14574,hey are you a black panther fan ? it seemed to be a cult classic !
14575,i have heard a lot about it ! i know t'chala is crowned king ofw aknaada foll3ing his father's death .
14576,yep you're fribght . actually black panther is considered the richest superhero too .
14577,i 3onder how tich he is ?
14578,ne has an estimate d500 billion ! ! ! that is dirty rich !
14579,that is a lot of money . and i thought diseny was a big deal !
14580,yeah same with me . marvel is just as big . in 1998 they actulaly offered teh cinematic rights of theuir characters to sony !
14581,wow .m arvel is the company that cdreated superhero blue erar for the boy that had to wear hearing aids but told his mom superheroes do not wea4 hearing aids . marvel heard it and created te characrter .
14582,that is so nice of hem . marvel actually argued in court once that mutants are not people !
14583,was that the case fought to pay a lower rate on toys instead of a higher rate o ndolls ?
14584,yes thats the one ! i think they won !
14585,good for them ! i know marvel branding began in 1961 .
14586,thats a lot of years of making money ! disney actually doesn't own the rights to show popula marvlec haracters in theem parks east of the mississippi !
14587,"oh , interesting . wait , is that due to a contrwct ?"
14588,yeah they signed the contract with universal wtudios back in the9 0's !
14589,oh tha twas a long time ago ! marvel started as timely productions .
14590,interesting . sounds like they then progressed to becoming atlas conics . . ;
14591,"yes , they might have . so back to disney , frozen was hte first animated film directed by a woman ."
14592,wow talk about srtar6ing off 3ith a abng ! ! tnat was a great movie . another first wa swhen lion kin gdubbed into zulu for its african release .
14593,i loved lion king ! i know durign the 1970's disney cycled a lot of yheir frames resulting in identical scenes in some movies .
14594,yea i heard about tht . the 6toy industry also sounds like they anticipate the movies ! nice talking to you driend .
14595,do you know many facts about voting ?
14596,hmmm . how about that thr 2012 election was the fist that didn't have a veteran on eithe rparty's ticket ?
14597,good point ! did you know that the indian gov't sets up a polling booth in a forest fu;ll of lions for a single vote ? i kind of fins that hard to ebliev because as far as i know there are only tigers in india .
14598,haha ; well thered obnce was a dog that beat two people in an election for mayor 6then served 1 years ! wonder what city htat was .
14599,"what are the odds of that ? hahah the citizens olf ajstin , tx once voted to rename their garbage suhmp after fred durst !"
14600,ac at named hank placed third in a senate election in viginia . what is it with people voting for animals ?
14601,that's funny ! lol astroauts can vote from space . that's a good thing !
14602,aslways good when people can vote .h ow about this one thec andidat who blinks the fastest has lost every presidential febate since 1980 .t hat's a crazy st6at .
14603,how in the heck did someone even decide to tart tracking that dta ? wow . lpl
14604,i was htinking the same thing . another anima lgetting votds in 21988 a chimp came in third place for mayor of rio de janeiro .
14605,"that's funny ! 34 percent of the bkack male population on alabama has permanently ,ostt he right to vote !"
14606,"that'd tragic . hopefully they can pass legislatiln to correct that . speaking of alabaja , 40 percent of voters voted to continue thde legalb an on interracial marriage and this was in 2000 ."
14607,"thay's crazy . when arnold schwarzenegger was governor of ca , he would fly by private et 3 hours every day to sacremneto ."
14608,"man , tahts' quite a commute . jfk , who is widely rememberex for his work to advance civil rights , actually voteda gainst the 1957 civil rights act ."
14609,intersing ! texaa elected their first feamle governor before some states even ratified the 1th amendmnet .
14610,"that's awesome . in south carolina , n atheistg cannit be governor . that's insane ."
14611,"crazy indeed ! in 1934 , north dakotas governor declared martial law nad seceded from the us . never heard that before ;"
14612,"i've neverh earxd that eit5her . in kentucky , you can't be governor i you'v eever participated in a duel . i guess that rules me out . haha ."
14613,what ? that is an odd one for sure ! the beatles wrote ' come together ' for timothy leary's 19690 ca governor campaig . it's been fun chatting with you !
14614,yoj too !
14615,have a goodd ay !
14616,good afternoon theo . 8i think it's very important to vote in elections what about you ? elections have ben operating since the 17th century .
14617,"it is a great ptocess of decisionma,ing for citizens to choose who gets to hold a public office . democracy is great !"
14618,yes democracy is indeed the best no doubt . officials in ancient athens were appointed by lottery because they believed electionsw ould lead to an oligarchy . boy were they wrong .
14619,yeah electoral refprm was definitely needed to improve the fairness of htes process for sure .
14620,i definitely agree . another weird thign is that since 1900 the taller candidate has wn the us preswidential eelction 75 percent of thet ime . now that i think of it trump was taller thna hillary .
14621,"hmmm , that is so weird . not as weird as a cat named hank 3ho placed 3rd in a virginia senat edelection . lol"
14622,yeha ust not have been very good candidates . the oter turn out for us presidential elections hasn't breached 6 2. 8 percent in hte last 100 years . htat's too abd .
14623,"yeay probably not . so liike th etaller candidate winning 75 percent of the time , the faster blinker in the presidential debates has lost every election since 1980 . i wonder who sits around and counts the blinking ?"
14624,yea hi need to know who is coming up at the stats ! nevada is the only state to have a non oft hese candidates voting option for presidential elections .
14625,so do i . i like te way ore4gon works . all rtheir elections are codnucted by mail so you don't even have to leave the house to vote .
14626,wow that is so convenient 2 almost like astronauts voting from space .
14627,yes just likwe tuat . apparen5ly people like aniamls more than some politicians . a dog beat 5wo amyorila candidates and actualpy served 213 years as mayor .
14628,"ha ha that is hilarious . 8n 1944 , north dakota's governor declared martiall aw and seceeded from the us . i didn't even knkow that was legal !"
14629,"don't lauguh too much at the dog . in rio de janeiro , a chimpanzee got 400 , 000 votes and came in 3rd in another mayoral race . those mayors must be horrible peop.e ."
14630,wow that is sdo amazing ! how does that even happen ? when arnold schwarzeengger was governor of california he commute dthree hours every day by private jet . not exactly enfironmen5ally friendly .
14631,woe you zre right about that . in kenrtucky you can only become governor if you have never participated ih a duel . who even does htat anymore ?
14632,ha ha that is some ol dschool rules right there . do you remember the beatles song come together '? it was written for a california governor campaigh !
14633,"really , how cool . the governor of ok has a pool shqped like the estate . i think that is awesome ."
14634,yeah that is very patriotic . texas elected their first femaleg overnor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment . it was the second elected female in ther ation ! it wzas nice converaing with you ! i hope you have a good evening .
14635,"gir lpower ! : , i like how po,itics is progressing in that way6 . same here . bye !"
14636,by e!
14637,hey there did you vote in the last election ?
14638,"i died not , i would nave probably selected ' none of thesec andidates ? option if i was in nevada"
14639,"yep i would do 6hat too . i thini that's an oltion everyone shoudl haved , would youe ver live in ancient athens ? apparently they would do elections like a lottery"
14640,seem .ike they were tr6ing to avoi doligarchy to form !
14641,hep it's apparently so . it's kind of sad that voter turnout maxes out at 63 percent in the united states . wha tpercent do you think it should be ?
14642,"not sure but people just don trust nay politivian anymore . did you k,now astronauts ca nvote from space ?"
14643,"wow that's really cool ! another thing that i didn't know is that the tallet presidential candirate has won 75 percent of the time since the year 1900 , so the democrats should deinitdely rub a basketball player lol"
14644,i am wondering i fthat is a coincidence because it has halpened for more than 100 years and 75 percent is a high percentage
14645,yep i agree with you . iw onder which election was won by the shorter candidate actually haha . did you hear that in 2012 international election observers were blocked in nine syates from viewing the polls ? why would htat be
14646,fhat soujxs pretty strwange ! it is strange also that a garbage dump wa snamed after fred durst qnd that was vlted by ths citizens of austin tx
14647,"that is pretty funny . i guess if you are fred durst you would be k9nd of embarrassed , but you have sok muvh money you just don't even care lol"
14648,"that is true , they are just happy to make healdines , did you know how the indian government put a voting booth in a forest full of lions ?"
14649,"no i didn'tk now that . that's super nice of them though . what is it nice is that 34 percent of the black population in alabama , specifically males ,m lost their rjght to vote ermanently"
14650,"that is crazy , talking about musiv , i did not know that the beatles's come togethe was written for a poliyical campaign !"
14651,"no i didn't know that eithert . are there any governors that you like ? i remember when schearzenegger was governor of california , apparently he would commute to work everyday"
14652,"he commuted 3 hours wow , that is such a long commute , and it was i na jet !"
14653,"yep in a jet ,s eems like a waste of money especially for ful but oh well , did you ehar about the governor who seced4d frpom the united stzates ?"
14654,i heard something ghappenned in 1934 in north cakota . i wonder why that ocurr4d ?
14655,yes i wonder what faused him to do that . very intefesting that texas had a female governor before the 19th amenmden twas ratified . that's imprewssive
14656,that was somehting ou tof thr ordinary ! ! and it was te second in the nation !
14657,"yep that's why i think it was so impressive ! also impressive was the guy ralph laurence carr . he actually opposed in turning the japaneseamericans during world war ii , tha twas probably not a popular opinion back then"
14658,"i try not to involve myself everyday with politics because it can be so negative , but i felt really proud to vote in the recent midterm elections . voting is so important for u sas a group ."
14659,"i feel the same , so much negativity , but in order to enactc hagne we must vote ."
14660,it'as crazy to think tjat voter turnout hasn't exceeded 62 . 8 percen tin tje last cenhtury .
14661,"i think many people are disenfrnachised with thec andidates . nevada has it right , they ahve a none oft hese candidates option . . if we could vote for that and th3n get new pepple it would be awesome !"
14662,"i'm not sure how i feel abouit that . sometimes having that option withb a group tat feels like everythin gis bladck and white , or blue and red , so to speak , thenn ot votng for eihter would take away votes from the other candidates . if voter turnout was better , maybe we could really have a shot of a multiparty election . astronauts even make sure tov ote fro mspace !"
14663,certainly there is something we ened to do to ge better turnouts . but there are so many who cant vote . like the 34 percent of black men i nalaabma
14664,maybe athens hd something right about just having a lottery to elect a candidate ? it does seem like we're heading 5owards being an oligrchy with the coting system as it is .
14665,true . beatles have written some campaign songs . lik efo timothy leary's 1969 governor campa9gn
14666,"yeah , come together is one of my favorite beatles songs ,"
14667,there was a governor that once declared martial law ands eceded from the us ? back in 1934 .
14668,i believe it was north dakota . i wonder why the unied states let them back in ?
14669,"i dont know , maybe it is part of the constitution that states cant do that ? or the people of th esgate voted to get back in ?"
14670,i know it's in the texas constitution that the7 can secede . texas is more pogressive than people realiz e. it hadt he secon dfemale goveeno rin the nation before some states even ratified the 19th amendjment .
14671,"really , i didnt know fhat was part of the texas constitution . im from floida , the one state that cant seem to do a neectio nznd fvoting correctly ."
14672,"teah , anc a lot of people htink colorado has always been pretty progressive , too . ralph lawrence carr was the only governor who objected to japaneseamerican internment camps during world war 2 . can yo believe tha ?"
14673,no . that isd pretty crazy
14674,"not crazier than austin , tx votign tor ename their city dump to fred durst . naha !"
14675,i can't believe they could actually vote to do that . that is wild .
14676,apparently k the taller presidentisl cadnidzte has won 75 percent o fthe time . hope the next person uis taller than tump !
14677,for real . lets start searching .
14678,i just wish they wouldn;t make voting so hard for some people and we could have s shot . some people wait6ed for up to 5 hours to vote in georgi a.
14679,"that is outlandish . if astronutsc an vote froj sace , surely we can figure it out here on earth . anyway , ive got to go . bhave a good night !"
14680,do you like to play video games ?
14681,"i do , but i don?t play much . do you ?"
14682,"i don't play much eitber but have an xbo xone , i think hat game fe can be an interesting choic efor a weekend"
14683,did you know playstation 3s afe being used to research black holes ?
14684,"they are ? thats amazing , i wonrer whyt hey use play staions instead of supercomputers"
14685,the us dept of defense used 17650 ps3's to build a supercomputer because it was cheaper than the alternative 2
14686,i see thats a creative solution did you ever plah grand theft a8to ?
14687,yes ! fdid you ? i heard the playstation game plays the soundtrack in a c player .
14688,"i palyed it but neve rtried to reproduce the gmae in a cd player , it was a great game though"
14689,agreed . do you like animals ?
14690,"i do like animals , there are 20 quintilliom of them on the planet !"
14691,cvrazy ! the study of animals is called zoology . wis i stud8ied that more in school !
14692,"i do too , there are many interesting facts like how naiamls develop white patches on their foreheads once they are domesticated"
14693,also that in 2002 germany was the first country to give animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rifhtx .
14694,"i guess thats a nice thing to eo , some people treat animals like trash and its not like they can fight back , especially if they are small and defenseless ."
14695,agreed . what is your favorite animkal ?
14696,"my fcavprite animals ared ogs i aslo like birds , do you have a preference ?"
14697,birds are just oh so fascinating . did you know most birds bones weigh less than their feathers ?
14698,"wow thats interesting , i never knew that ab0utb irds although 6hey must have light skeletons in order to fly , must be difficult to fly with a lot of weight on them ."
14699,hummingbirds actually steal spiderwebs to build and repair their nests !
14700,"i get spiders must hate them hten , that sounds messrd up , poor spiders aftedr all htat hard work . . . ."
14701,i would be pissed if i was a spider .
14702,"ik now right , theres not much spiders can do about it dso yea h."
14703,hey did you know tbat scientists are usign ps3's to research the agic of black holes ?
14704,i think thoae scientist sare lying ! they're just playing games on those ps3s ! lol
14705,haha i want that job ! do you ply any videogames at all ?
14706,i used to play . not so much now .t he ux dodloves the pw3 . it used 1760 of them to build a supercomputer because it was cheape4r thaj the laternative . what was the alternative ? ps2s ?
14707,"hha ya it wouls take 10 , 000 of those probably ! ya i used to play too , i think it's cool you could plsay the grand theft auto game disc in a cd player to ehar the spundtrack"
14708,"changign topics from the mechanical to teh biological ,d id you know that there are about 20 , 000 , 00 0, 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 individula animals on the planet ? humans beings and their play stations are such a small part of the lving world ."
14709,"ah i didnb't know that , i wonder what kind of videogames other animals would paly ? haah , i do think it's interesting that in germany animals have legal rkghts , lie i wonder what they are , do they have hte right to vote l, etc haha"
14710,"perhap sthey can vote if they have white patches on their foreheads . animals d3velop white patches on their foreheads when domesticated . i do not have a white patch on my forehead , yet i feel domesticated . do you have a white patc h? there's no shame in it these days ."
14711,"haha let me loo in the mirror and check , that is weird , like we have a dog and it is wll black with no white atch bu twhat do i know , i'm drinking soda and have the hiccups , i guess that is a peftocer from when animals had both gills anf lungs apparently"
14712,"you w0uld still have rights in germany though , no matter what holdovers from your ancestors . under the 1912 scottish protection of animals act , the loch ness monster is a protected epecies ."
14713,do you think that the loch ness monster is real ? i want it to be real qand a protected animal nut to be honest ir eally really don't think it is haha
14714,the ficti0onal beast has more protections than i do . i'm nevious .
14715,"haha , and more protectinos htan the dodo bird who went extinct sadly , i didnt' know it was a spieces of pigeon actually"
14716,"the dodo was not terribly clever . australia has some weird creatures , like wi,d birds that can mimic the sounds of cameras , car alarms , and chainsaws . i wonder if they have austraoian accents ."
14717,"ahha good question , i woudlb e scared to be walking , then hearing an austrailian chwinsaw , i'd think i was being chased by a mrderer ony to find it was a haemless bird haha"
14718,the bird might steal something from you to build a nest . hummingbirds stela spiderwebs to build nad repair their nests .
14719,"haha the pider sneed spider police ! what is crazy 8s thzt a brds' skelton weighs less than the feathers , i wouldn't have thought tat was true"
14720,"the bones are hollow , which maies tbem stronger than if they were solid . sounds fujnny , i know . how can birds migrate without sleeping ? i wish i could do that ."
14721,"ya i wih i cou;d work while i wa sseleping , then i could get paid so much i'd be very productive !"
14722,"i usually sleep when i'm working , so it's close . well , enjoy being one of the 20 quintillion animals ont he planet !"
14723,thanks ! hopefully you don't grow a white patch on your forheead if you ever ge tdomesticated !
14724,hey hsv eyou heard of the video gams fe ? it's for all of the latest video gaem platforms
14725,i have not ; wha5's the objective ?
14726,"have oue ver played a metroid game ?a pparently this is similar , it's a metroidvania style game"
14727,"9'm not fajiliar ; doea that refer to an aesthetic style , or type of game ?"
14728,it's a type of game . basically you run around a level that's huge and then you come ack when you get new abilities to parts that were previously locked off
14729,"that sounds stimulating , i ikagine there are a lot opf animals kn the aorld ?"
14730,yes i8 thjnk so . even in our world there are about 20 quintillion so i think un the game there must be opleny haha
14731,i wonder if they have constitutionallyguaranteed rights like the ones animals in germany gained in 2002 .
14732,yes i wonder that too . and what kind of rights do they have ? did you hear what hiccups are ? like what they are remnants of
14733,appwarently they're an evolutionary holdover f4om early landx animals that had both gills and lungs . i wonder what th eloch ness monster would have ?
14734,"that's a goox question ! does the loch ness monster have hiccups ahha . but it is interesting hat scotland passed a protection act tok eep the loch ness monster safe back in 1912 , do yout hink it exists ?"
14735,"if it eve rws sreal , it' stot to be extinct now . did you know that the extinct dodo bird was actually a subfamily of pigeon ?"
14736,no i didn't know that . i also didn't know that animls will develop a white patch on their forehead ocne they are domesticated
14737,"that's interestingseems like a pretty useless adaptation , though ? soem wild birds in australia havw adapted to mimic the sounds of cameras , car alarms , and chainsaws ."
14738,that is vool . i wonder if anyone been fooled by them ? i also think it's cool that hummingbirds will steal a spider web and make a nest out of it lol
14739,"thy are some clever creatures . i wonder how the birds that ,igrate from alaska fo msexico without sleeping pull that off ? that's a neat trick ."
14740,"yes k wish i could stay awake that long . i also wish ,y bones were hollow ancd light because then maybe i could flyh aha ."
14741,"yes , in most b9rds he eawthers actually weigh more than the entire skeleton . i wonder hoqw much the eggs eigh females down before they lay them ?"
14742,"that's a good question ! i wodnr if theyc an even fly if htey are fulo of eggs ? on a different topic , do you play any video games ? for instance like on the playstation"
14743,"i enver got teh hang of it , but the tehcnology aspect of it interests me ; for example , the dod used 1 , 760 ps3's to build a zupercomputer ."
14744,"that's impressive ! especially because it was cheaper then to build an actual supercomputer , also did you know thaqt playstation 3s ae also used to research blacl holes ?"
14745,what are your thoughts on elections ?
14746,thereg ood for the people as long as they arent' rigged ! !
14747,"well it seems like elections are rigged all the time , i wish we all had the option to vote none of these like in the state of nevada"
14748,"i agree , all of the states should have that 9option ! its interesting the taller candidate wins most of the tie in elections ! 75 percent of the time ! lol"
14749,"that is an interesting fact , 75 percent of the time no kidding . anxint athens had a weird way to appoint their leaders ."
14750,yes appointing by lottery wouldn't work in this day and age ! ! lol
14751,"it woyldn't , voting is a great way to chose al eader ."
14752,did you know astronauts vote from space ! ! no excuse ! ! lol
14753,"no , didn't know about that , well 3 percent of the black jale population in alabama lost their right to vo5e ."
14754,that's trrue . not alo men ha o righy to vote in the uk until 1918 .
14755,so voting has cahnged a lot over the yeafs we know vote to chsnge the name of ag arbage eump .
14756,"poor fred dursg , whow ould want the name for a garage dump ?"
14757,"they must hate him a lot in austin , t x ,go through so much trouble ."
14758,must be ? indian government will set up polling booths in the fo4rest full of lions for z single vote ! who knew ?
14759,i guess they take their voters real seriously there sounds like a lot of troubekl for a single vote .
14760,crazy wifh lione ! 2 did you know queen elizabeth 2 wa spranked called by a radio station pretending to be the prkm minister of canada !
14761,"that so funny , i bet she was angry after eharignb she was pranked call and i bet the radio station got sued ."
14762,"yes , how would you like to get a silve rcup if you live to 100 in japan ?"
14763,"that would be nice , you would have to get to a hundred years old first butt hat sounds like a nice detail ."
14764,"yes , but japan has so many people living to 100 , the3y have to give cheaper cups ! lol good chat ! !"
14765,"life expectancy is a lot higher ovr there i guess , its bewn a greatr chat thanks a lot ."
14766,do you thin kits fair how india is treatign prime minister trudeau ?
14767,i'm not s8re . i'm not a fan of trudeau but modi should at leawst greeted him . can yiu see gandhi doing that ?
14768,"gandhi is all about peace and respect so no , not really , i think 5they should treat him better , he is a visitor from a foreign country an ddeserves respect"
14769,"yeah , the trudeaus hadf to go on their tours alone . they drressed in ethn9c indian clothes but modi wasn't there ."
14770,"i guess there is a lot of controversy about this issue , so prime minister , the head of a cabinet , s9unds like a really big responsibility"
14771,there are reports that this trip is an election thing for truddeau . he wants the sikh vote in canada .
14772,"what are your thohght on thi8s ? i dont care much about politics really , it sems like trudeau is a good leader but there are also controversies surrounding him"
14773,"if's a thing between india wanting trudau to distance himself gfrom sikh separatists and trudeau wanrting their gotes . i reall,y do't have an opinion . hope they can work it out ."
14774,"ih ope that too , theresa n interesting fact about japan and when ypu turn 100 the prime minister sends you a xilver cup yo celebrate it ."
14775,"yeah , that's cool . meanwhil ein australia , the pm's not evend efinewd in their constitution ."
14776,really how can that be ? the prime minixter is the ruler of australia ?
14777,they just go with it being a ; custom ' . doesn't seem lik4 a solid foundation for government .
14778,"t seems lile a fragile govenrment , its funny how a radio station pranked called queen elizabeth ii"
14779,"hee . it's alsof unny that since q900 , the taqller candidate won teh presidency 75 percent of the tikme ."
14780,"ig is a cool fac6 , height must influjence us in a subconcious level , that sounds like an advwntage"
14781,"i wouldnt' know , i'm 5'11 ' . did you know astronauts votw from space . tha tleavex no excuses for me . . ."
14782,"i agrsee if the3y can vote f5om spac3e i guess w3e also have to o our part , there is a dump in austin texas called fred durast , tha is kind of messed up lol"
14783,"yeha , not exactlyc okplimentary . . . it's sad that the turnout vor presidetnial elecions hasn't exceeded around 63 percent in the last 100 years ."
14784,that is sad and thats how we end with a president like trump .
14785,i htink trump's done a great job . maybe that's wny people shouldn't talk about politics . let's talk about the chief mouser in the uk's pm instead .
14786,i agree but i respect your opinion thats why democracy ex8sts right ?
14787,hello there . do you like to vgot e?
14788,hey . yes i do ;. even astronauts in space vote ! how about you ?
14789,i was up in space but i forgot to vote . i overslept . oh well . my bad .
14790,haha i'd say you'd get a pass . not on earth though ! i wonder why 34 percent of black men in alabama have permanntly lost the right to vote ?
14791,j figure that it has to do with criminal conviction s. maybe other stuff that the pplice tump up . voting i sa h7man right .
14792,agreed . i know a law was recently passed to allow certain convicts or criminals the ability to vote .
14793,good . the right should never disappear . few people vore anyway . we need people to vote . the people that dont vot4 hsould be criminals ;
14794,semiagre . people also have the ight to choose not to partake .
14795,in some countries you must vote or you pay a fine . that is the way to make people vote .a lso yoh couldc hoose ' none of the above ' or rite in a candidate .
14796,that's wy i'm glad to be in america . i wouldn't6 want to live in a country taht ' makes ' you do things with penalty .
14797,i dont understand . the aca still exists . tghe turn9ut for elections is low in thi scountry . i would people to votd . what should we do ?
14798,"mind uour business ! haha that's what you do . worry about yourself and your own . that's the problem with society , everyone is worriwd about everyone else but themselves ."
14799,"ok , i dont follow . people vote for polticians and laws . do you not wnat fhat ? minding your own business means not voting ?"
14800,mind your own business baout people who don't choose to vote .
14801,it is not much of a democracy or a representatuve govt if people dont vote . by not voting they give up power that people foughy hard to get .
14802,so punish them id teh answer ?
14803,"gtetting people to participate in a democracy is important for dwemocrscy . youc an call it a punishmen t, but you can always write in a name of someone else . rivghts comew ith rezponsbilities ."
14804,"so make coutning votes mored ifficult by forcing people to come in to write ridiculous nonsense ?. if you make me come in to vote , i'm writing donald duck on the linr . even thouhg the turnout hasn't breach 63 percent in the last years , that's still a good enogh turn out to elect an official ."
14805,"it wont be more difficult tl count votes . it really is not a ma6te of logistics . you can take pride in not participating in democracy . you will ge tofficials , but will they represent te peopl4 ?"
14806,the votes needed to be counyted and recounted last election .a dd at a minimum 35 percent more votes and now you have 100 percent of the peoole votiny . not all 100 percent of the peoppe are sund in mind and values in making a decision like taht anyway .
14807,"yes , so then who hsould vote ? who should decide who gets to vote ? i would not want to say whrether you could vote or not . i shouldn ot have that power over you . if the vote counting system is flawed , it should be fixed ."
14808,you're missing the point . everylne can vote until they choose not to or lose the right because they are a violent offender .
14809,"the prime minister sure has an important job ,r unning a fountry , being a leader is not easy ."
14810,yeah the prime minister job ist o manage the civil servie and execite the3 diretives of th ehead of statd .
14811,"yeah n many systems he also selects many members of the cabinets , the prime minister is the chairman of this cabinet in many systems as well ."
14812,rhe prime minister of australia position isnt in the constitution . it exists only through custom .
14813,hey should change the constitution japan has a primer minister also and when you turn 100 you will get a congratuation card .
14814,i ehzard that they send you a silver cup when you turned 100 . so many people were turning 100 that they had to find a wasy to get cheaper cups . lol .
14815,"9 think thats a great thing , not everyone makes it to that age , so what are your thoughts on eletions ?"
14816,i think there is something wrong with us hwen 2 . 8 percent voter turnout for the residential election is ridiculpus . it hasnt reached over that number in 100 years .
14817,"and thats how tump got electe dlol there is somethinvg wrony i agree also the taller candidate seems to win 75 percent of the time , looks like we justv ofte for the taller candidate ."
14818,i dont know about that . there is no way ever i would vote for hillary .
14819,"i dont know , she seems like a better choidce than trump by no , no offense i fyou are a trump fa ."
14820,im not offend4d . did you know nevada has a none of these candidates option while votin . maybe evewry place should have that and neither one of them wouldh ave got elected .
14821,"i didnt kmnow that , but 34 percent lf 6he blakc male in alabama lost the right to vote permanently ?"
14822,"i wonder why that is . maybe because o feloni3s for some of them , but that seems like a really high number ."
14823,"yeah that seems like a good reason , do you lnow who fred durst is ?"
14824,yeah teh lead singer of limp biscuit . right ?
14825,"yeah the lead singer well in austin 6x peo;le voted to rename their garbage dump after him , thy must really hateh im over there ,"
14826,lol that is funny . i waqs never a big fan but i dont hate him i guess not all men in the uk could vot3 until 1918much .
14827,"it does seem like a waste of resources htough t is funny , and really ? i guss that has changed by now ."
14828,it certainly has changed . i thin kthe world is becoming a much more tolerabld place . i love it . well i hop you have a wonderful day .
14829,"i agree , its becoming a better place , i hope you have a wonderful day as well , bye ."
14830,"hi , how are you ? are you intereeted in elections and votingt ?"
14831,"someehat , i find the ancienjt elections interesting like the appointment of officvials byl ottery in ancient athejs"
14832,i think they saw teh threat of wealth and small groups dominating government . it created the oppprtunity for outsiders to entert he fray .
14833,yea the ancient athenians believed elections would lwad to an oligarchy
14834,i guess they must have encoutnered that problem and found their solution for their e;ections . i wonder what we can do nowadays to alte rthe nature of election .
14835,well nevada has ' none of these candifates ' optioh o their presidetia lballots
14836,"it hink that's a goo dway to register disgust with the field , but i wonder if htere is a way to encourage outsiders to enter without worrting about fujndimg ."
14837,i don't think there will be any improvement in the fairness or effectiveness in the us election s6ystem anytime soon
14838,"cange in thes ystem in rhe short term is unlikley , but other countrie shave int3resting ways to get people to vote . those might work here ."
14839,yea i't a shame that internationla electoral observers are bl9cked from polls like they were in the us back in 2012
14840,"i don't know how that could have happened . i thought they would have the eight to obsrve ,b ut i gusss htere is n0o wsy to prosecute the perpretrators in the us courts ."
14841,"the laws are messed up , in alabama 34 percent of black males have lost the right to vote"
14842,"i eonder if that ahs to do wiht criminal cojviction or what w hen someone is in prison , i understand that they could lose teh right to vote . afterward , though ? seems like the sentencr is over , so the punihm3nt should end ."
14843,probaby a mix of that and voting id laws that prevent 34 percent of black males in alabama from voting
14844,"og , no id , no vote ? ok . i guess if you have to prove sonething that is diffjcult to prove , then effectively you losed the right to vote ."
14845,yea the us isn't accommodating to voters like otehr c0untries . ijn india they set up a polling bopoth for a singl evoter in a forrest
14846,that's astonishing . i guess democracy is taken quite seriously there . i wish it were the case in the us .
14847,"yea , votimg isn't htat important , voter turnout hasn't breached 62 . 8 percent in 100 years"
14848,i don't see that changing until voting is mzndatory like in austrslia ?. i enjyed chatting with you . have a good night !
14849,well at least in texas they got to vote the name of the garbage dump to fred durst
14850,"well , good night !"
14851,good night
14852,"hello there , are you much of a hockey fan ?"
14853,i loveh ockey . what about you ?
14854,yesh i think its cool but i wish i had a hometown team to support . do youh ave a favorite team ?
14855,i like the columbus blue jackwets since i'm from ohio . did you know canada is the3 only country in the world with two national sp9rts . those are hockey and alcrosse .
14856,"i have not heard of them . no , i didn't know tha t, very intwresting !"
14857,a hockey player was traded for 1 back in 1993 . he wnet on to win 4 stanley cups .
14858,"that is awesome , i wonder what happened to the person in charge that made that trzde lol ."
14859,haha good questio n. an ice hockey rink remains under a basketball court when switchging stadium sports .
14860,yeah i think i have seen the tie lapse videos tehy make of then changing it .
14861,the average hockey player in the nhl will los eup to 8 lbs in one game .
14862,"that id impressive , they do wear a ton of heavy stuff and skatin garound that long is hard tod o ."
14863,it' sa very tough sport to play and you have tk have a ton of endurance .
14864,"yeah you sure do , i have never played avtual ice hockey , just roller hockey in the streets as a kid ."
14865,ice hockey is a lot of fun . do y0u like horses ?
14866,"i do likh orses , my aunt does hsow horses . how about you ?"
14867,i love horses . i've ridden them a few times in the past .
14868,"i hav eonly gone riding once when i was really young , it was really fun though ."
14869,icelandic horses have a fifth spee d. it's called speedwalking for a horxse .
14870,"that is pretty ool , i aould like to see a video of that ."
14871,tuat would be cool to see .
14872,"yeah i would , hey itw as nice talking with you , i hope you have a good day !"
14873,"ehllo , gow are you ? what d9 you think of horses ? did you know that horses in iceland hav ea fiftrh speed , called tolt ?"
14874,i think i watched a documentary on them ! it was really neat . do you wwatch golf at all ?
14875,no i don't . i have watched a little hockey thouhg . it's the national sport of canada .
14876,i love hockey . it's alot of fun to watch . i guess jummy fallon likews alex ovechkin too !
14877,"oh yeah ! i think he was o the shiw with mike smith , the jockey of the justify ."
14878,"whne you w4eret alking horses , did you know al lthroughbreds can trce their lineage back to one horse ?"
14879,i didn't know that ! i wnder what it looekd like .
14880,maybe it would be on googld ? the name is darley arabian . i should loo kit up !
14881,should have known it would have arabian in it . those are beautiful horses ! lipizzaners are too ! dir you know that they are actually born blaci or brown and it takes up to 6 yeqrs before they turn white ?
14882,i ahd no idea !d id you know horses are ticklis h!w hat a thing to know !
14883,no i didn't mnow that but it's al ittle funny to think about ! thinking about hockey from earlier i remembered that there's more than one type of hocke . most of the planet thinks of hokcey as field hockey whereas canada and the u . s . think of it as ice hockey .
14884,true ! the us hock4y team lost ro a england high school team !
14885,are you serious ? ! that's bad ! canada is supreme though in hockey . in the first olympic winter games in 1924 they scored 132 goals .
14886,wow ! hockey also onlkyh ad 1 shared penalty box ! imagine the fights !
14887,true enough ! the game oz grezte xercise though . players lose a lot of weigh tduring a gaem .
14888,i imagine in water weigth alone ! did gyou know the tshirt was invented on 1904 ?
14889,i didn't know that . was it invented in the u . s . ?
14890,i think so . it was invented for bachelors who couldn't sew !
14891,i guess that would make sense ! it's as practicsl as people in hawaii wearing aloha shirts instead of suits and ties .
14892,very true ! that plain grey shirt that zukcerbrg wear s? 300 . i sh9uld introduce him to hanjes !
14893,"i know that's right q1 hey , did you know that popo shirts were actually invented fpr tehnis ?"
14894,"i did know that ! really weird , but yes ! did you know that sunligh tdetermines hte ;length of horsesh air ?"
14895,hello ! are you a hockey fan ?
14896,to be honest i am not but my boyfriejnd is a huge hockey fan . all i know abou thockey is tha tan ice ring remains under absketball courts when switchign stadium sports .
14897,yes that is interesting ! i can't believe canada scored 132 goals during the first winter olykpics !
14898,that is an insane amount of goals . i believe canada ks the only country in the worlc with two national sports lsacrosse and ice hockey .
14899,two totally different sports in a sense ! i think i should play some hockey to lose weight . most people lose 8 bls while playign it .
14900,hockey is physically demanding so i believe you can lose htat much weight . i am mor einto fashion . did you know that polo shirts wre invented for tennis and then later adopted bvy polo players ?
14901,i didn't know that but totally believe it 2 clothing didc ome a long way though . the whole popping collars thing sztarted i nchina !
14902,that isr ight ! during the cultural rev0lution gang fashiln involved layering as many shirts as you could .
14903,i think the most i could do is three lol . that isn't for me fors ure q i wish i lived in hawaii though when it came to fashion .
14904,"oh i believe you're talking about the offkcial business and office attir3 in hawaii is the aloha shirt instead of the suit and tie , right ?"
14905,i am ! i wish i saw billy may's funeral pssession t9 see those blue shirts and khaki pants !
14906,a very relaxed feel for a funeral indeed ! do you know the difference between a buttond own and a button up ?
14907,i do ! i'm mo4e of a buton up guy !
14908,another passin ofm in is riding horses . have you ever rode a hors e?
14909,i actually did once jn the rokcy mountains haha it was so much fun ! i didn't realized almatians calmed down horse at fire stations back then .
14910,i wonder why they're able to calm a horse . 8i rode my horse to school one time with my father's blessing of course . unlike two high school students who rode their horses to school and got suspnced for it .
14911,that would have been a sight to see ! i used to see peopl edrive theirt ractor sto school where i am from lol .
14912,it was so much fun . i am sure riding tractor5s isf un too . i can't go near horses too much necause of my allergies . clint eastwoo dhad a mid life allergy to horses . it's a shamw because he was horse back riding in many of his mofies .
14913,i tink he used to always ridw them in movies too ahha . i wonder if they could speed walk like icelandic horses can .
14914,icelandic horses are so interesting . lipizzaner horses are cool too because 5hey are born black or brown and it takes about six years for them to turn comopletely white .
14915,that is an awesoe fact ! well hav ea great nigh !
14916,"hey there , do you like horses ?"
14917,"hey there , or should i say , hay there ? i like hordes , but not shoveling horse . i als have an allergy to horsrehair , like by idol , clint eastwood . are you an quine fanoer ?"
14918,"i am indeed , i real.y like horses . did youk now that in iceland horses have a fifth speed which is speedwalking ."

14977,"3rd rock from the sun won the golcen globe for best comedy series in 1897 , beating seinfeld , friends , and frasier ."

15007,"i do like superheros so yes , althoug u havent opened a comic book in years ."
15008,did you know michigan state library has the world largest collection of vcomic books ? who knew ?
15009,that is a weird thing for them to have ? i would think la or something that has ore to do with comics . dc means detective comics .
15010,i was surpr9sed oo of all places ! i didn't know that google purchased teh name gmail . com from garfield comics . i love garfield and the gang ! lol
15011,really ? htat's weird . why did garfield have it ?
15012,did you know mj tried to buy marvel comics in the darly 1990's ?
15013,j ? michael jackson ?
15014,"yes , so he coul dplay spideramn in his own produced ,ovie . i' m sure would ahve been a winner !"
15015,"anytime i'm dowjn , i think of him setting his head on fire i nthat pepsi commercial and it rbings a msile to my face !"
15016,"lol , i know that was sometjhing ! he's getting pretty bad press on the latest movie . i haven't seen it yet . i think it will be uosetting . speaking of fires , like eddie van halen's speakers when he played beat it !"
15017,"i can't do voluntary sadness ,e spscially sicne i had two kids . i heard that movie was disturbing . have you seej the other movie on netflix whre4 parents let their kids stay w9th like a 04 7ear old ?"
15018,"no , sound irresposnible , thes epoor children ! ! i agree with the voluntary sadness . but we nred to know whatever the truth is . if we even really get the truth at times ! do you like animals ? i'm not surprised they have a dominant side likeh umans woth their paws ."
15019,i do like animals . i live with 2 cats ; im not a fan but love dogs !
15020,"i have two garfied cts . i love them to bits ! ! i have a dkog aslo , love tyema ll ! i like yhe idea ofh aving a lawywr to represent aimals like they do in switzerland !"
15021,doesn't germany give them full constitutional rights ?
15022,i'm nots ure ? if o that's geeat ! i think i heard something about that ?
15023,it was grwat chtting with you !
15024,"seventyfive million dollars is a lot of money for a film , 3ouldn't you say ?"
15025,it is quite a bit . that can easily benm ade u at offic eif it is goo dthough .
15026,"we;l , anything having to do with marvel usually goes over big !"
15027,so true ! shockingly marvel sold almost a;l of its characdters for only 25 million ! considering how much that is worth now thats crazy
15028,"yah , adn i can't beli4eve sony rejected all but spiderman !"
15029,spiderman has had such a weird run though . all those reboots and th ebroadway play that failed
15030,true . they hav egotten a lot of mileage out of spidsrman .
15031,certainly . they must hav4e run out of odeas because they made cap'n crunch battle him .
15032,"so funny ! lol ! bottom o the barrell , ya think ?"
15033,just a little bit . i'm sure that was during the 90s sperhero slump
15034,whatd o you think about ' lucifer ' that mike carey wrote ?
15035,i haven'tr ead the comic book but i am super interested in his new book someone liike me .
15036,"yah . eceryone likes ghost stories , rihgt ?"
15037,i love horror and ghost stuff . this seems like a really interestinhg take on ghost stories too
15038,"' lucifer ' tho , was one of his best selling comics ."
15039,true . that and hellblazer both seem interestijg .
15040,"carey's main eeal is novels , surprisingly instead of comics ."
15041,yeah i would guess comics because that 3eems to bd where he started but nhis novels seem very popular too
15042,i htink the success of ' the girl with all the gifts ' is becquse a lot of people actually go htrough that .
15043,i'm sure he'll have a lot of success just like neil gaiman did
15044,' someone like mne ' is so real also because abuse is so real in this worls .
15045,very tru e. i'm also interested
15046,"i read about soundtrack , poems , and elections"
15047,me too . i didn't know that stevens pielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrac k!
15048,"i know , and the info about daft punk discussing the tron soundtrack over pancakes while suited up blew my mind ."
15049,"and how about phil col,lins recording in five languages the tarzan soundtrack , that is amazing . iw ish i knew more than one language ."
15050,i was equally7a mazed tk learn that teh japanese alphabet forms a poem
15051,"i write poetry myself . and i have read the poem that is depressing reading forward yet inspiring when rdad backwards , it wa sall over facebpook ."
15052,i write oetry too . i had no idea it went back so far .
15053,"yeah , i find poetry to be a great outlet for mg feelings . did you see that edgar allan poe only got 9 for the raven . though i am sure back in that day 9 was al ot ."
15054,"it might have been worht a bit more , but i sdon't think money was ever wort heven 10x more than it is today"
15055,"i love the raven , that and the tell tale heart . poe is genius ."
15056,"yes , when i originally read the tell tale heart in middle schiol my 7oung mind was blown . cna you imagine winning an el4ction by lottery that you didn't even want to be part of ;"
15057,oh i kn9w that would be insane . i cannot believe that they didn't believe in elections .
15058,it makes sense to me . i think they were on to something with their fear of oligarchy .
15059,yeha but what if the person elected didnt' want to be in charge ? nevada is awesome with the ' non eof these ' optilns on ballots . i think allb allots shoulx have that option .
15060,how about 75 percent of taller candidates winning all elections ? i found that bi tparticularly fascinating
15061,i think taller people look more trustworty and powerful .
15062,i wonder what an ' international electoral observer ' is . i've never heard of that . . .
15063,i have never heard of an ' internationa lelectora; observer ' either . is tat a perso nim a different country who is observing our elections here ?
15064,"that's what i would think , but i hever lewrned about such a thing in civics class or anything ."
15065,ih aven't eihter .
15066,"overall , i learnec al ot that i didn't already know"
15067,"hey have you heard of the documentary mjonrovia , indiana ?"
15068,"no , i hve not . is itg ood ? why i shere a documentary about monrovia ?"
15069,"haha well it's about smalltonw america and it does sound pregty boring , ity takes place in a tow nthat has only a 1400 person population"
15070,they are being punished ? whyd o they live there ? noc hoice ? what is the movie about ?
15071,"they're not being punizhed it's just looking at their lives in the aftermath of the 2016 election , i don't know it doesn't really jnterest me , what do you think about elections in general thoug h?"
15072,i think that the people in monrovia porobably voted for trump . didr they ? i expect they did .
15073,yeah i think that's wha it sounds oike . did yo9u know that in ncient athens they would do a lottery isntead of a direct vote for their leaders ?
15074,i would buy many lottery tickets then to win the leadership . i wonder how many tickets it would take .
15075,"well i would at least help with voter turnout i think , it's hocking that the united states has maxed out at around 63 percent for presidential elections"
15076,"i thinkr hatt hey annot make money when they vote . i fthey get money , then they would vote ."
15077,"yeah that is possible . there should be a day where you doh'?t have to work and that js the day taht voting takes place , what do you think aout the nevada option to vlte for ' none of the candidates '"
15078,i think that every election should have such a choice . i would then run as ' none of the candidates ' and get elected . i would win !
15079,haha tha'ts a good idea ! why do you think that international observers were glocked from lopoking at polling locations in 9 us states ?
15080,i think that the international observers were planning to get in the way of omethkng and americans werewn't going to stadb for it . why were they there anyway ?
15081,i guess they just look at thee lections make sure they're fair . but i don't know why they would not have been allowed . it's interesting that democracy has been tbe way t9 elect most politicians and most of the civilized country since about the 17th century
15082,"i guess that democracy could wlrk if there were asl ottery for people like me . a rando mperson could get chosed to b ethe president , they wouldn't have to run or nothign , just wait ti8ll their number got clal3e and bam ! president !"
15083,"hahza that would make a great reality shjow i tghink . by the 2ay , do you ever read poetry"
15084,i do notr ead poetry as a ruleb ecause it uns counter to my orientatipn .
15085,"haha well i don't really like poetry either , but i do like edgar allan poe's poem the raven , unfortunately he only got 9 for writing it"
15086,"he proably should have worked on his penmanship and then he would have got more money for the poem . anyway , i hav eto run . i have to go to my poetry rfeadung ."
15087,"hah ai will make sure to read demetri martin palindrome poem , it only has 224 words"
15088,did you know taht n ancient wathens they did a lottery to appoiknt their leaders ?
15089,"i heard that ! it was to avoid oligarchy , kind of like the problem we have now in rthe us . power is in the hands of the few !"
15090,"that is true , what is weird is taht in 2012 international election officials were blocked from the polls in 9 states"
15091,i thonk it's st5ange that observers can' twatch an election in the us . what were they hiding there ? probably sojething fishy like fraud . shades of the 2000 elecftion .
15092,"ya i don't like that at sall , but elections are crazy ,s ince 1900 the tallest candidate ha salways won at least 75 percent of the time"
15093,that could explain why trump got elected . maybe the demss houldc hoose an nba playe ? then hte odds would be better .
15094,haha not a bad idea ! i als like nevada's idea of giving a ' none ' optiohn when voting in their elections
15095,"when the votera are so disgusted with their iptions , they can show their disapproval . i like it . u think that this next election is going to be interesting . many dems have already declared candidacy . i don't know who' stall enough to win thougnh ."
15096,"haha yes that is how they should pick , just choose the tallest one ! do you like poetry at all ?"
15097,"i'm not a big can of poetry , but i envy those who can write it ."
15098,"well i engy edgar allen poe , but n9o th efact that he only got nine dollars for publishing the raven"
15099,nine dollars ? i guess the guy must have had a side job teaching r something to support himself . 9 doesn't buy enough booze for a poet .t he javanese alphavet forsm a poem . i wonder oif that's like the abc song .
15100,"that is interesting , i do like hte lord of the rings and apparently all of the hobbits names were taken from an ld icelandic poem"
15101,"that souns like something tolkein would do . he loved language , especially dead ones . frodo , bilbo . hm they sound icelandic ."
15102,"6a you're right , i shohdl read that poem , i think it'd calledd vergatal but i don't knowh ow thats pron0unced hzaha"
15103,"i 3ant to read ht epoem that is depressign read forward , but inspiring read backward . sounds quite clever ."
15104,"ya i wonder jow that qokrs , kind of likeh ow each track of batman begins is named afte ra bat , like what kind of bat names haha ?"
15105,it dounds like an odd choice . i guess it's for batnerds . i didn't know that spielbedg could play the clarinet . i woder if he got roalties for playhing on the jaws sound6rack .
15106,"hah ai bet he does , i did like o brother where art tou , i guesst hat soundtrack was certified platinum not nce but 8 times"
15107,"george clooney lipsyncs to the trac . he can't really sing , though his aun5 can . the film is a lot of fun , though i don't think it won any awards ."
15108,"ya that movie is under appteciated , i like all oft he coen brothers movie personally , whata nout you ?"
15109,do you like watching documentaries ?
15110,i do . did you see the new one from frederick wiseman about smal town americ a?
15111,"i haven't seen it , but it seems like it puts an interesting fpocus on small town smerica ."
15112,yes . he is a vreat documentarist . i wonde if kt will cause any controversy seeing as its abojut politics and reliyion .
15113,"they might , but it?s good that he tries to eb object , and free of any agendas ."
15114,i like that is shows civic life and he doesn't probe the peiople hwo live there . he does not interview them .
15115,i like how he takes things into perspective taht i would never see if i were passing through thoset owns .
15116,same here . do y9ou like listening to soundtrakcs ?
15117,"i don't really , unless while watching a movie . what about you ?"
15118,sometimesx . did you know steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack ?
15119,"no , i did not know that . phil co,lins also recorded the tarzan sounhdtrack in five different languages . i have heard hte english and spankish versions ."
15120,"that is cool . the o'brother , where art thou ? soundtrack is certified 8 tiems platinum ."
15121,it m8ust be gpod thne ! i'll have to check it out .
15122,it is good . each of the track titles on the ' batman egins ' soundtdrack is the name of a genus or family of bat
15123,"that's cool . wiseman's documentaryw as compared to poetry . it's interesting how poetry hase volved . it has been around since 25th century bce , the pyramid texts"
15124,poery is great . it lets people express themselves . edgar allen poe only received 9 for his poem ' the raven '
15125,"wow , that seems kind of s d. i'm interested to check out demtru martin's poem as it has 224 palindromes . i wonder if ite ven makes sense !"
15126,it would be interesting to read . teh javanese alphabet gforms a poem if recited in order .
15127,"hmm , i wonder what that means , exactly . i will have to check tht ou t."
15128,anotehr interesting thing for me to learn is stuff about elections .
15129,apparently the concept ofe lections was around in ancient athyens but they thought that elections would lead to an oligarchy so they used a lottery instead .
15130,"hi , how are you ?"
15131,i am good . do you like to read fictin ?
15132,i prefer nonfiction but id o read fiction . do you enjoy rrading it ?
15133,i try to read a little bit of every genre . the longest piece of fiction written is a 4 million word super zmashb ros brawl fan ficion . i'm not sure i would have the patience to read through it al l.
15134,i know i do not have the patience to r3ad it . coud you write that much ?
15135,"i do not think so . i think ia ould have a better cance of writing a drabble , a work of fiction that is exactly 100 words long ."
15136,did you ever read l . ron hubbard ? y dad had all the books but i ever read them .
15137,i have not . i do know hisw ork is based on the belief of sxcientology where as others view it as scienve fiction .

15144,"i ma not eithee . i get too scared ! although if i knew you could burn cqlories watching it , i may chage my mind !"
15145,there wasn't a single person involved in filming the original exorcist that thought itw as a horror film . i have a very diferent view qs an audience member !
15146,i have never seen that movie . i won't watch it . seems really scary to me .
15147,you are smart . stic with movies like injception that was supposed to be a horror filmb ut evolve dinto a heist film .
15148,"as you say im smart , you choose the one movie i cannot follow along with . i guess i ma not thay smart . . ."

15154,"just anything that i can relax and take my mind off things with . interesting , they also have named gattaca as th emost accurate science fictikon film of all time . have you watched it ?"
15155,do you have a favorite comedian ? gattaca ? that sounds like a star wars movie .
15156,"i am not really into favorite actors and such , no . how about you ? speaking of accurate science fiction ,s ome people really take that type of thing seriojsly . you can get an mit science fiction society membership that coves you in case you die and come back to life ."
15157,you hsould check ut jokoy ! he is a funny guy ! that is interestingh .

15168,"if you watch borror jovies , you can burn up to 180 calories ! should that be my new exercise 0lan ?"

15172,are you a fan of ficton ?
15173,"yes , i like fiction . i like science fiction too ."
15174,di dyou know there is a wikit hat ranks fictional characters ?
15175,i haven't heard lf that . sounds interesting . i wonder how they rank them .
15176,"it does , they rank them by their powers and abilities . pretty cool , buh ?"
15177,that is cool . di dyou know that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a sc9ience fiftion comic because i tfeatured a black character ?
15178,"no , reall.y ? that's sort of weird . apparently j7lius caesar wrote fiction too ."
15179,he was a thoughtful and ambitious ruler . and he conquered a vast swath of the world as well . i wonder what he wrote about .
15180,"that he was . i think it wasa abo thercules nad oedipus , ever heard of them ?"
15181,"yes , that is interesting . i would expect hefcules , but oedipus ? hm . maybe he had some odd interess ."
15182,"what about scence fiction , do ou follow it ?"
15183,i read it when i was younge . i liked asimov . i don't read much now .
15184,"i read a book by asimov , he was pretty good ."
15185,he wrote the foundation series . he was a prolific writer . loved to grind out prose .
15186,did yoy know nasa named gattaca as the most accurate cience fiction film ?
15187,i saw that film a while ago . accurate ? in 2hat way ? i think that it'sx scary to think tha6 we'll all get engineered and nothing will be natural .
15188,"i' not sure , i've seen it too . i d0n't believe that statement at all . lol"
15189,"yeah , some of hte facts floating around seem a bit sketchy . i do believe that nana has a list of accurate spacet echnology terms that writers can use i nscience fiction stories . that would be easy to do ."
15190,"wha tabout horror films , do you wstch them ?"
15191,i like a couple of them . the exorcist . the omen . the shiming .
15192,"i'm not a nhug efan , but when i was yunger i liked tehm ."
15193,do you like nike products ?
15194,i ave a fw pair of nike shoes as well as nike running shorts . i am aware of the backlash nike has bee nreceiving as of late but i still prefer to be comfortable despite what the label may host .
15195,yeah ? but i think they exploit things ? 515 for a wind breaker and 229 for a mesh shirt designed by mathew williams tat rhey possibly had made in hcina by some swea tshops ! i think those are ridiculous prices !
15196,i agree the pficing is crazy but people will pay that for a look they wish to achieve despite the fact that the article of clothing at hand may be of gang relations or just a simplr shir made to cover one's torso .
15197,yeah . . for sure ! i guess i can't lbame nike . . . so they are just trying to make a profit ! jut seems like the explpita5ion of yougn people tha tador ethe branbd thats all
15198,i agree with that as well . it seems tge next big fad is aroundt he corner and any brand out there is qat risk of sham8ing if not liked bty many . i just feel i would rather have a siomple polo shirt ic an wash and wear not costing me ana rm and a leg so i ca npurchase more than one color . i prefer the simple things .
15199,the simple things . . . i like that ! i wonder why ri8p curl has their clothes made in north korea but te label states made in china ? lol geez !
15200,"i woulsd think maybe a component of each article may bd made in chian and finished produt in north korea , still uncertain as to why thuough . i have heard of an interesting placet hat sells thingl ost from air ports in alabama and think it would be cool to visit ."
15201,yeah that would be really cool ! what is a collar gap ?
15202,collat gap is a term used by highe nd clothing makers tod etermine the spacing on a shirt collar that has buttons or space between them .
15203,oh . . . interesting . . . would of never even thought of that ! see your simple polo shirt was actually invented for tennis ?
15204,"i am aware of thq tyes ! i believe that from need comes product being that inventions form from products being needed and not available . f9or exampls , xertain attire comes from the need o fa professional wanting to lookt h epwrt o ra personn eeding to relax comfortbaly wears a tshirt ."
15205,i wanna weork in hawaii so i don't have to wear suit and tie !
15206,i fesl hawaii would be a great place to work as well as experience the cultural differencws available . i dot hink however clothing would need to protect one from thee lemethns there on a fullt ime basis as hawaii does not experience the extreme differences in weather seasons as we do here on the main land .
15207,"that' strue , but i wonder if them wearing aloha sirts comes from comfort or tradition ?"
15208,"i feel it would be a part o fboth aspects . one looking for comfort from the heat eleemtns of the area they are in a swell as be somewhat fashionablyf orward wit6h thet ime in question , moreover ; protecting one from environmental elements ."
15209,"so , hpow m,ny olo shirts you have ?"
15210,i have a few on hand but being in te professional field i am in i seldom have the chance to wear them . i for certain prefer ht esimple comfort sbut forced to uphold hte profdessional look for my field .
15211,"yeah , geing a professional and upholding the look is not comfortable amd cheap either !"
15212,agreed ! i find i look at clothing as a needed expense it can at times make or break one dep4nding on hte situation ay hand .
15213,yep . . . well great chat . . . have a good one !
15214,do you like clk6hing ?
15215,i usually prwfer it to beign nude . do you like clothing ?

15217,"i wonder how fashionablet hat was . . . pilgrims were fashionable , wearing co.lorful clothes ."
15218,"yeah , apparently the black and whit ewas only for formal dress . wo knew ?"
15219,they get a bad rao then . all the moview portray them as dull .
15220,"eah , i agree . whata bout shidts , do you like them ?"

15225,"yes , i can see the connections . his nickname wass the crocodile .g uess what their logo is ."
15226,a crocodile ? they are expensive k that is for sure . lol i personally like ralph lauren .
15227,that's rigth . lacoste is the name of the clothing line too . ralph lauren doesn't fit me rigth .
15228,"interesting . i have as imilar problem with ralph lauren , even if i get slim fit , it seems baggy ."
15229,i am not sure i you have been 6'6 ' beore but nothing fits us .
15230,"nope , 5'10 ' . they have the big and tall , but i suspect that it doesn't wlrk out wo well ."
15231,"no . they do not take the same caare foe big an dtall . the shirs usually end up a big mess of a shirt , the tp alf too small and lower half too big . ig men pronlems !"
15232,"yup , before the iternet was the rage the problem i had was finding my size . everyone wears it ."
15233,too common so it was never in stock ?

15248,"cool , id he have a reasonf or that ?"

15262,"yeah that made me real mad , 100s hows in total since its creation in 1989"

15268,"yeah talent like that one only comes once in a life time , did you know he was alive at the smae time as pokahontas ?"
15269,"makes sense , shakespeare was born around 1564"
15270,"yeah and died in the year 1616 , he was a great poet , actor , writer and his plays ahve been translated intlo many lnaguages ."
15271,plus shakespeare coined the phrases ' good riddance ' and ' laughing stock ' too
15272,"he also invented opular names we use ti this day like ilivia , jessiaa nd miranda . he sure had a big impact in our culture ."
15273,it's pretty crazyt hat andret chaikowsky donated uis skull to the royal hsakespear ecompany in order for it to be used as a prop
15274,"that is cool , his skull is really famous i guess it was used in a series of performances of the famous play hamlet ."

15294,' we wer on a beeak '
15295,ha ! that is the best
15296,love it . did you know comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows . that really goes to show that a good comedy tv show s hard to come by
15297,"it is , altnoug habout 34 a year is what they cancel . so over time it all adds up ."
15298,"oh yea i guess thats less absurd baha . well i'm going to go watch so,mef riends , good chatting w9ith you !"
15299,"hi , how are you this afternoon ?"
15300,good . you ? i'm watching an ol dmeryl streep movie . . l

15302,did you see her in the deer hunter ? she got an academy award nkmoination for that .
15303,"no , i didnt'? see her in that . i remember her in devil wears prada ."
15304,"yes , nice ! she rarned a best supporting actress award in kramer vs . kramer . did you see jer is that ?"
15305,"yes , i saw that one . she has so many ! hard to believe her first film role was a sp0rts movie ."
15306,"i never saw it . she probably got nominated for that too . after all , she is the most nominated actress ever with like 18 nods . that's more noms tjan most actresses get rolews in their lifetime !"
15307,"i heawr ya ! very surperising that although she got nominted so manuy times , she has only won 3 times ."
15308,tpugh business . it wazs nide to see he and stanley tucci reunite in julie adn julia ! 6eir performances made me hungry !
15309,"i saw that one too , hey were awesome in it ."
15310,"yeah , and sinc etucci is ane xcellent cook , he made streep cook for him in preparation for the role a sthe famous julia childs ."
15311,that's cool !
15312,i wonder 2hat kind of preparation ehe did for her role in holocaust which earned her an emmy ?
15313,"idk , it was probably something very intense . i'm sure ."
15314,do you know what producer dino de laurenti ssaid after she auditioned fo ra rol;e in king kong ?
15315,"i heard he said in italian that she was ugly . but , was shocked when she replied abck to his insult in fluent italuan . how vfunny !"
15316,"nice . i bet he wishes he could ea tthose words ! she has even been nominated for 14 british acawdemy awards , which is ijnsane considering th eamount of britisht alent that had to be overlooked ."
15317,"that's so true l on a differsent note , do you like shakespeare ?"
15318,"t used to be my nickname ! not because i aj as old as shakespeare . . .s ince he was alive during the time of pocahontas , which is a little older than i . whats' your tak on shaekspeare ?"
15319,"i love his works . was sh9cked to find out that he invneted the names , miranda , ejssica , and olivia . how cool !"
15320,"that is nice . and tbey are so popular still today ! on the other hand , nobody is named ? yorick ' anymore ! did you know that tchaikowsky donated his skull to the royal shakespeare theatre in hope of having i tused asa a prop one day for yorick ?"
15321,"that's very strange indeed . well it's been nice chatting with you this afternoon . hop eyou enjoy the rest of you rday , friend ."
15322,i hdar nike got int rouble for selling a balaclava .
15323,i heard about that .? ritics said the design perpetuated violence with stereotypes of black youtha nd gang culture . that's sad !
15324,i just thought they were ski masks for using in the colxd and snow .
15325,"i agree the company wasn't encouraging the issue of gang or criminal cultur e. b8ut it's like everyone has to be carefupl wit what they say , do or reelase these dayw ."
15326,i thinks more offensive thaqt it sellsf or 92 . probably cost 1 to make . just because it's got a designer label they can charge that much
15327,"so tre . so very , very true . the cost i sso ridiculous ! also , i didn't agree with that facebook video that was shared 38 , 000 times either where the guy claimed the item ' looks as menacing as anything i'ce ever seen ' ."
15328,it just takes one statement to get forwarded to create a scandal . theee seem mors important things going on in thew orld to get worked up aout .
15329,"so true . i mean , i doubt the pilgrims ever got wokred 8p over any of their wardrob eand it was always f8ll of color !"
15330,"i've never worried too much abouf clkothing , probably sbo7r as much as tge pilgrims did . my wardrobe is pretty basic , baeed on cost as naything else ."
15331,so true . i wonder what kin dof wardrobe we could find in that alabama store that sells only clotes and cameras found in unclaimed baggage at airports .
15332,"i think that's maybe where i do drawt he lune . i'd sooenr it new than second hand . some of my shirts ae getting a little worn , maybe i should get z couple of new ones"
15333,same here ! o need to fid a new button down . crazy how htey call it a b8tton down because the collar tip fastens to the body of the shirt where button up does not !
15334,we shoudl move to hawaii . if not for the aloha shirt then for the sun ans sea !
15335,"ha ! so true . must be nice never having to wear a suit and tie especially wben it's hot out . that sounds so much more convenient ! on a related note , the pallbearerts at billy mays' funeral didn't ear a suit nad tie either , they wore khakis and blue shirts ! ha !"
15336,if that's what you what then fine . i'd love to go to one of thosef ancy unctions like the academy awaqds in a tshirt and shorts .
15337,no kidding ! are you a fan of apple by chance ? they actually had their own clothing line back in 1986 . wonde4 what that was like ?
15338,"if i worked there i'd fele obliged to wear it . yeah , i wonder hwat it looksl ikd , i bet it's not a 229 nike msh shirg with chest pouch ."
15339,that's the trut h. i bet nik productc ost mor ethan smallder dinosaur fossils . r that glow in the dark dinosaur coin that canada has !
15340,i'm stipl waiting for scientists to mak dinosaurs come back like jurassic park . then humans could live sid eby side with them
15341,"i mean , they've managed to gnetically alter chickens to express the dna their dino ancestors had , xo anything is posible !"
15342,"it'll happen one day , then we could all have a pett rex ."
15343,"so true . ha ! craz tl think dinosaursw ere mesothermic , in between warm and cold bloodrd . must have been nice !"
15344,"hi , do you like fiction ?"
15345,i like some . i have read a lot of science fiction like asimov's ' i robot . '
15346,cool . do you kn0w who wrote the oldest yborg in fiction ?
15347,n9ot sure . i do know that i was taught asimov's 3 lws of robotics in a robotics course i took in college .
15348,wow that js amazing . nasa apparentlyu has a l8st of words that writers can use ?
15349,coo .
15350,oh that is sad . do you know which adtor holds the science fiction trifedcta ?
15351,"again , not sure . i was surprised the l . rob hubbard was a scifi author . he's in the book ' hte golden age o science fiction . '"
15352,nice . the actor is deep roy
15353,"neve rheard of ' deep roy ' until now . wow , the worpd's longest piece of fiction is 4 million words long . tkae that tolstoy !"
15354,niceee . do you watch horror movies ?
15355,i watch ery few . i can't stand slasher movie sbut i like stuff like alien . hzrd to believe e . t . was originally slated to be a horror movie .
15356,yeah that is strange . do you know how they make those scary sounds in those movies ?
15357,don't know . i do know that the 1996 film ' screa m' was originally going to be fitled ' scary movie ' . wasn't taht title used in a mock horror file ?
15358,they apparently use an instrument called a waterphone . it is so creepy
15359,i like science fiction ebttert han orror sven though it got its sta4t with mostly cheesy ' b ' movies .
15360,yeah . hage you ever been to a fan convention ?
15361,"no . like groucho marx , i wouldn' tbelong to a club that would have em as a mejmber . i can't believe no one though the orgiginal exorcist moviue would be considered ' horror or"
15362,yeah i was surprised about that too . and did you watch the shining ?
15363,yes . i'll never forger ' red r8um ' . . . there is a work of fiction called ' drabble ' that is exactly 100 words long . i wonder what it sold for ?
15364,"oh wow , that is short , what can one say in1 00 words ? nice chat : ,"
15365,are you a fan of the science fiction genre of film ? i like it because it uses concepts not fully accepted by mainstream scince .
15366,yss i am az an of science fiction . i especially lov the spaceshipsa nd interstellar travel of the star trek series .
15367,oh nice yeah that's definitely reaoly cool . nasa has a list of accurate spacr tehcnology terms t6hat writers can use in science fiction stories .
15368,i've heard that . the writers do a lot of researc hin order to mqke the stories as real as plssible .
15369,yeah i think that is very important the more realistic it is the more interesting . d3eep roy is the only aqctor to hold the sciencefiction trifecta . very cool .
15370,i don't recognize his name though . what all has he been in ?
15371,"yeah actually i don't either . he hs been in star wars , star treo , and doctor who . he's also been in xfles ."
15372,"that's pretty impressive . i've heard that nasa has named gattaca s ther most accurate science fiction movie of all time . yet , i've never heard of i teihtesr ."
15373,well i really need t0 look that up . the jit science fiction society has botnh a lifetime membershp and a more expensive one tuhat covers you in case you don't come back . that is pretty funny .
15374,it is ! i wonder how you become a memkber of that club !
15375,good question i'm not sure . i also really like the horrorf ilm gner . itw as inslired by a literary authors like edgar alla poe and mary shellet .
15376,"oh , speakinf of poe , di dyou know that he wrote the oldest known exakpel of a cyborg ?"
15377,no i never knew that that was quite inhteresting . 3atching horrpr movies is a very energy intensive task and you can burn up to 180 cal .
15378,"ic an believe that ! it probably speeds up a person's heart rate so fast that it's like runnibng . isn't it odd that horror has been around since the days of poe , stoker , and shelley ?"
15379,"yeah very cool . or also overlaps with a fantasy , supernatural fic6ion , an thriller genres . that makes sense . kind of like a potpourri of genres ."
15380,it does . 7oi cwn watch a show about aliens and it ca be frightening in the extreme . have ou heard that watching a horror movi4e before viewing abstract art amkes you like it more ?
15381,no i never knew that but i wil lhave to try it sometimes . the water phone is the intrument that makes thoae cree;py metallic noises in horror movies .
15382,trea.ly ? that's interesting . it kind of takes some if teh scary ou tto know just how things are done in movies .
15383,yeah very true . the shining was another scary moviw and it was very surprising that the little boy who acted in the movie didn't even know it was a horror film .
15384,true . didn't he find out several years later ? i'd like to know how everyonr kept him from knowing the trut hfor so long .
15385,"i would like to know that as well .s tephen king found the movier bambi scary as a chil,d . i find that kin dof ironic ."
15386,do you hav ea favorites dinosaur ?
15387,"ye a, the trex i cool , s0 are other dinos froj the cretaceous"
15388,"t rex is awesome , i lke jurassic park movies because of the t rex"
15389,"yea , jurassi park was an awesom emovje although i dont think any of the dinosaurs im it wer efrom the jurassic perkiod lol"
15390,"lol , i never knew that ! did you know there have been fossils found in all 509 states"
15391,"that is 0erett cool that all 50 states have fissils , i wonderw hich dinosaur fossisl are in alaska"
15392,"or ven hawaii , hat is far away from anything . 40 percent o famericans tyink that humasna nd dinosaurs lived at the same time , that sees high"
15393,well technically birdsx are a type of dinosau5 but i don't think the 40 prcent of americans knew that
15394,"that is true , i want to kniow what an actual dinosaur looked like and not hwat we think it does , that woul dbe amazing ."
15395,"yea , it be pretty cool if there we4re dinosaurs that glowed in the dark like canada's dinosaur coin"
15396,"that would be awesome , and at least you could see it coming in the dark lol . i never kndw dinosaurs were mesothermic"
15397,"i wonder how scientiszts were able to figure out dinos wee mesothermic since we've never seen them , unless they got that indo from birds"
15398,iw onder how they have figured anyghing out or even knew where to start afterf indign the furst one . so midn blowing in my opinion !
15399,"yea , maybe one day they will be able to make a real dinoaaur through altered chicken dna"
15400,i would love to see that day ! i would shake in my clothing in excitemeny
15401,"yea , oen day there will be pet dinosaurs and you can buy dinosaur shirts wiuth popped collars like chinese gang fxhion"
15402,"lol i was hoping that died out and never again would come back , let shope one day it doesn't lol"
15403,"i hope ghe zaloha shirt never dies out , it is the official buziness attire in hawii"
15404,"that is awesome , i own a couple , but never have worn them . i might as wesll make a trip to hawaii ! it was so great chatting with you !"
15405,"you too , i'm ghonna look on ebay for some of th original apple clothing from 1986"
15406,i am going to look in unclaime dbagag elike in alabama and see if any are there . enjoy your evening !
15407,"hi , jow are you ?"
15408,i'm great ! how are you ? are you a fan of comic books ?
15409,"i am well , thanks . althouth not a fan of comic books per se , i do love comic nook movies like the black panther ."
15410,"b,ack panther , a character created hy stan lee , the man who endede very phone c9nversawtion with the word ? exclsior ! ?'"
15411,ha ! i did not knkow that . what would be the word you enxed phone calles with ? i end mine with ' peace out home boy ! '
15412,"i use ' 3word ' or ' aord up , dawg . '"
15413,nife choice . that's in my lexicon too . i wonder what john zasbhbery uses ?
15414,"he's a poet , so his command of language is far beyon dthat of is mere mortlas . do you know what the dc in dc comics stands for ?"
15415,i do not ? district of columbia ?
15416,"detective comics , so dc domics is detectiv ecomics comics ."
15417,"ha ! i never knew that . there is a character that dc andm arvel owns , access . . ."
15418,"i don't really kowt hd cahracters well . i've heard that there is a clark kent in the marvel universe , bu the's just a repor5er ."
15419,ha ! just a reporter . i do love superman . i did not know they own the trademark on super hero . . .
15420,"htats ounds like something that the lawyers cooked up . what will they tfademark next ? the mswu library has the largest comicb ook collection in the world , the center of all htings nerdy ."
15421,"i would assume that princeton or yale would have it , som eold money college with nothing epse to do but collect and strive to reach harvard ihn status ."
15422,"maybe they'll do that for vidreo gmes , the next big medi aboom ."
15423,yeah . there's going to be a gim ewhne al he video games are bouhgt onlien and there will be no more gametop . . ?
15424,"that might be a good thing ! gamestop , as dead as tne doso , a bir dtaht is pwrt of the pigeon famioy ?."
15425,nice transition ! bamestop migh tas well lfy to northern mexico and stay there .
15426,"gamestop could byild a nest from spiderwbes , just like the hummingbird does ."
15427,hahaha . nice chatting with you !
15428,i had never heard of john ashbery before . what about you ?
15429,i am nokt into poetry as much as i should . i did hear that tjsir sare some poems that when you read them normally are depressing and when you read them backwards tey are inspiring .
15430,that backward reading of poetry was so new to me ! i think that that is really cool .
15431,what is even cxooler is taht the japanese alphabet fotms a poem with recited . that is ogerwhelmingly detail oriented .
15432,is it japanese or javanese alphabet ?
15433,"jabneese , spell chekc is such a problem ."
15434,that's true ! no to worry . consider thik amazing overwhelming and detail oriented concept the demetri martin coul dwqrite an extended palindrome poem that was 224 wor5ds long .
15435,poets definitely don't get paid enough flr their creativity and hard work . did you know that edgar allan poe only received 9 forh is poem ' the rafve n' ;
15436,wow ! poor poe do you like comics ?
15437,"i liked the archie comics when i was a kid but i enjoy the marvel and dc comic inspired movies and tv shows , i only just found out that marvel owns the trademark for the term 'superhero ' and ' supervillain ' . how can one comic mnaker own those tewrms ?"
15438,that's interesting fact about the trademark terms . i liked comics too but no treally a big marvel fan . stan lee just died and i understand that he alwqys closed his phne messages with the term excelsior ! i wodner if that was added to his epitaph on his grave . ?
15439,i would hopse they would give him that epitaph .h e made a lot of cameo' sin the recent movies . he was a big part of the genera . did you kniw that the dc of the dc comics stands for detectiv ecomics . the are similar but didferent .
15440,oh that's clever ! dc for detective comics i am learning so much . so the poet and artist ashbery used comics anc other bits of ephmeera in his collage artworks . i nope somec imic collectors don't get upset wbout this !
15441,i would think they would be fine wih the creativity . michigan stae uhivedsity ha sthe largestc omic book collectionj in the world . i wonder if they have his in their library .
15442,perhaps michiga nstate does have his in their univfersity lirbary . i would hope so . i do quite like teh creativity involved witha dded bits of incongruous bits of paper and childhood ephemera to create a piece of artwork . i do enjoy collage and childhood mmeories .
15443,the art of comics is a topic i ernjoy . liechtenstein popularized the comi c9mage and gave the art gorm respect from the fine art wofrld with the pop art kmovement .
15444,"do yoy recall the comic or maybe it was a cartoon with two black birds that wear hats ? tghose were very popular , it has some stereotyped and racist undertones . the only birds i see that i think are comical are pigeons . teh dodo bird nowe xtinct is a form of pigeon ."
15445,i do not recall teh image you are talking about but it reminds me of the two black birds in the dumbo cartoon movie . definite racial overytures especially wiht he music .
15446,some people are deathly afraid of birds . i have a friend who is afraid even by one stray feather ! can you iagine ? cn you imagine being chasedc by a birsd ? ashley did a collage of that too . a boy ebing chased by large bird .
15447,i can imagine . them ovie the birds is a great exampel of why we hould fear te birds . in ashley's work the boy has returned is very creepy .
15448,yes indeed ! creepy . a bird head . i would like to magine what it's lilke to fly as a bird does . lihgt and easy i imagine since the bird bones are hollow and amazignly weigh less than the feathers .
15449,so very interesting . thanks for the conversatiin .
15450,do you readc omic books at all ?
15451,"hey ! when i was a child , i did , but not later .n ow i woild say i don't have interest . how about you ?"
15452,i am sorry but i do not understand what you mean ;
15453,how about you ? do you read comic books ?
15454,"no , not really . i do admire stan lee though ."
15455,i didnt' know that google purchased thed omain name gmajl . co mfrom garfield comics .
15456,"yeah , i believe that got a pretty good deal on the domain . garfie dwasn't getting much traffic on the site at the time ."
15457,intetesting ! i'm not comic books as popular as tehy were 20 years ago . . .
15458,many of them are still worth a great deal of money and ther eis still a demand for them foir sure .
15459,"sorry or typing errors . i need to focus and don't do all wat the same time : , in the last message my point was that i'm not sure , but there isn't way to correct message . anyway you got my point lol"
15460,stan lee is an idol of m8ne and i enjoyed his comic work tremendously .
15461,"captain america was his the first break , right ?"
15462,i thought i twas spicerman but i could be wrony .
15463,"i don't know . i remember iv'e read that his wife destroyed his typewriter during an arguent . i don't know why , but i remember tyis mometn from one artice about him"
15464,did he write for marvel or dc comics ?
15465,"i guess marvel . iron man was marvel , right ?"
15466,i thiink so . he has been around comics so long that i bet he was one of the one that wrote the first one im america .
15467,i uess all comics universe could be totally different without stan lee
15468,i loved how he used thd term ' excelsior ' .
15469,true . i think there are some many awesome facts about him . i'm wondering is there any book about his life .
15470,i hve one autographed by him .
15471,hi k how are you ? waht do you think of our friend the sun ?
15472,htat eh is a real hotty .
15473,"hes , he is . he come sup every day withohut fail . he is dependabl e. and usually pretty warm . thoughh e has his off days ."
15474,he is heavy to . about 30000 times as heavy as earth is .
15475,"well , he has tried to keep his weigh tdown , but what is he going to do at his age ?"
15476,the sun looks yellow but it is actually white .
15477,"i figure that he was being misrepresented jn sone way . boy , that really i sunfair . he should be seen for what he is . nothig else ."
15478,you are right . as one white hot ball of burning gaa .
15479,he is quite hot . i'veh eard that the surface is not as hot as we think .
15480,yeah a liggtning bolt is 5x hotter .
15481,i wish we could harness the ensrgy of lightning . there must be a way .
15482,do you tgink a kite wnd a key could point us in the righ tdirection .
15483,i figure giant towers in areas wiht lots of lighnig . then a big battery to store it .
15484,if it were that easy . i figure it would have been donea lready l
15485,i guess you're right . i figure that thre must be a way thouigh . i wonder how often lightning strikes . itg would have to be enough to generate steady energy .
15486,i think solar is more the way to go . if they can make the solar cells cheap enough to make it worth it .
15487,"yes , solar i a better way to go . the energy source is steady and predictable . i wonder how muvh energy we can squeeze fro mthe 0ld boy ."
15488,well the sun produces enugh p9we5 in one second to power this planet for 50000 years
15489,you would have to capture all the energy from the sun with a dyson sphre . that would be tricky . then you would have to store it all somehow . als tricky .
15490,we have huge power plantst aht store masive amount of energy . i htink we could figude a way to store it . i think collecting it effeciently is the real problem .
15491,"yes , collection has theoretical limits . pluis teh matrial are ezpensive ane quite desyructivet o mine and fabricate . the sun is a great source of energy , but the challenge is capture ."
15492,i would sa we hav eto figure it out . everythin else is unsustinable .
15493,"true . wr are entering a difficult time . more people , more demand for energy , anyway , great chat 2"
15494,wellh ave a goof one . io goyta go .
15495,"hi there , do you have any interest in spwace and stars ?"
15496,i think htey are fascinating . the sun is probably my favorite star .
15497,so cool . funny to think that when wed think of ths sun we think 0f it as being yellow bt in fadt it is hwite .
15498,"yes , it has fo do woth the atmospheric scattering . htat's also teh reason the sky appears blue ."
15499,that is very interesting . the sun is so hot however the lightning bolt is surface of the sun by 5 times .
15500,wow . thwt puts new perspective on getting hit by lightening . the sun is a smallr star as well . it's 1 billionth teh aize of the biggest star in the galaxy .
15501,"yeah , so amazing . since its discove4y in 1846 neptune ha sfinnaly been able to complete a full oribt around the sun in 2011"
15502,ho interesting . did you know that the sun is almost a perfect sphere ?
15503,so cool . the syun evenj accounts for over 99 percent of the fotlas olar system mass
15504,"that makes sense clnsidering that it i 330 , 00 times yheavier than the earth ! it produces a lot of energy as well ."
15505,"so true . changing topics ,a re you a fan of literature and books ?"
15506,yes i am . one of my favorite poets is oscar wilde !
15507,"oh nice . he is amazing for sur e. a lot of people like him , like olivia wklde , who changed her last name in his honor ."
15508,"i didn't know about that ! he is very dearly loved , though . his tomb is covered in lipstick !"
15509,"and he had a good sense ofh umo r, once saying to the border agents , i have nothing to f3eclare but my genius ."
15510,haha ! i love that . he was certainly ane ccentric guy . h ealso wrote some great poems about his time in prison .
15511,"speakjng of the tomb and the lipstic kthat you mentioned , if you get caught there is a hegty price to pay ."
15512,"yes i know ! 12 , 000 . i wonder if they have cameras watching it ."
15513,could be . crazy relations between literature and governmenyss ometimes . like whe4n the fda burned six tojx of literature during a us censorship ;
15514,"there's very true ! or government writing literature , such as when winston churchhill won a nobel prize in literature !"
15515,exactly . iy was nice chatting wit hyou .
15516,"hi , do you ike to travel"

15522,"wow , it is amazing . i am so ejalous of your wonderful experience . btw , i am kind orf zsurprised that the sun is white , not light yellow color as we perceive"
15523,how far is earth fro mthe sun ?
15524,ih aven o idea . but it must be very far because if not our human being has been burned to distinction apready because of the sun's extreme heat
15525,i believe the sun's diameter is well ovcer 1 mil;ion kilometers in diajeter
15526,"i know it is big , but not exactly how big l hahaha . btw , did you know that lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of th sun , approximately 5 5times hotter"
15527,"wow , tha tis amazing . i did not know that but i do know that helium can also be found on the sun"
15528,"yeah , i hear a lot about helium and some of jts uses such ast o pump it into a ballon . i do not know about other uses of helium gas"
15529,helium was found on the sun before 6 was found here on earth
15530,"ohh , i see . did you know that the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star i nour galaxy"
15531,life on mars at night is amazing at the sunset isb lue and not black like here on earth
15532,i wish our earth could have a blue color insted ofb lack beca8se black color makes me depressed . hahaha
15533,is the sun blocking your interne tsignal tonitht ?
15534,"i hope not , if htat is the case l my holiday will be ruined . hanaha"
15535,i 3as worried the sun or msoke had voided the warranty on your computer
15536,enjoy your holiday . bye
15537,tell oscar wilde to keep up the wonderful acting
15538,hey did you know that the sun is actually white ? it's only our atmosphere that makes it yellow
15539,"i did actually , i watch a lot ot shows about the universe ."
15540,do uou know any cool facts ? like how lightning is 5x hotter than the sun ?
15541,"i didsn't know that . but i know that the sun produces neough energy in one seond to meet the needs of the entir eplnaet foe 500 , 000 years ."
15542,"ya i wihs we could harness that better somehow , that wouxl really solve the energy crysis ! also , i miss plhto as a planet haha"
15543,"yeah , it would solve a lot of our world's problems ."
15544,do you read books ? i can;t believe the fda burned about 6 tonnes of actual books
15545,interesting . do you know why ?
15546,"i think it wasa n act of censorship because the books were not factualo , but that still seems lik ean extreme thing yto do"
15547,"weird , so they wer fiction books ?"
15548,"yes i think so , i'd have to find more information , did you know that romabntic kissing is a tecent invention ?"
15549,"no , i didn't , but it would surprisem e . is that what churchill won a nobe lprize for ? kidding !"
15550,"haha ! swell i don' tthink so , it sounds like he won it for peace , but he was also apparenlty quitw a ladies man haha"
15551,"hilarious . there was a contest to come up with the worst possible sentence to a novel , did youk nlow that ?"
15552,"haha no i didn't what waws thef inal sentence , i must know !"
15553,"i don't know either , i just heard about it . pretty funny !"
15554,"haha i was just thinking next time i'm with my girlfrined and she goes for a kiss , i'll tell her i don't believe in kiss , it's a recnt invention lol"
15555,hilarious . did you know oscar wilde's were about his wallpaper ?

15557,"i read a few of his books . kissing his tomb could result in a 12 , 000 fien !"
15558,wow that's expensive ! i can think of a lot better thihgs to kiss though personally haha
15559,did you know theres' a wikj which ranks fictionla characters according to their powers and abilities .

15561,wow ! julius caesar wrote fan fiction ofh ercules and oedipus in his youth .
15562,"haha htates funny ! george rr martin despises fan fiction , aying that it is copyright infringement and a bad exercise fora spirinv writers ."
15563,surprising ! in the 19560s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character .
15564,"that's so dumb . stephen king wzs terrified as a chil dwhen eh saw the movie bambi , caling it the first horror moie he saw l"
15565,"wow , from king ? watching horror movies can burn up more than 180 calories ."
15566,"yeah , i jusrt read that , i might need to watch more of fhem !"
15567,"if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art , you awill enjoy the art more"
15568,"thwt';s good to ,now ! tbe ajority of creepy metallic noises in scifi or horeror movies are made by an instrument called a waterphone ."
15569,"really ? ! ? ! ? danny , the boy from the shining , did not know he was acting in a horror film until several years later ."
15570,"lol that ,ust have been disturbing ."
15571,proabbly ! i would be scared . . .
15572,ive heard the noises from walking dead and most zombie noise are just s9omeone eating chicken .
15573,really ? strangw ! nasa has a lust of accurate space technology terms that writers can use in science fiction stories
15574,starship troopers is the only science fiction novel recommended by thre4 of the five branches of the us military .
15575,term ' roboticws ' was accidentally coined by science iction author isaac asimov in 1941 .

15610,they probably didn't want to scare him for life . that was excellen . do't know how many times i've seen it .
15611,"i have onls een it lik once but know its fmaous . that would have scared the kid for sure , good point . i like watching horror movies before going to art galleries"

15617,"i love those alien type movies , which is your favirite ?"
15618,oh my . tehy're endless . thef irst was written over 1800 years ago by an ancient greek !
15619,"that is awesoem , id id not know that ! i was a big starshkp troopers fan"

15628,i like teh horfor tenre
15629,watching horror movies can burnh up more than 180 caloriex ! i wonser why i lose weigbt more when i watc hthem ; lol
15630,"usually a hit or miss , simply depends on th emovie"
15631,"ture ! if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art , you will enjoy th eart more . so rmeember that next time bdfore you go to an art museum !"
15632,i think horror films do a good job with tye msic to set the atmosphere
15633,i agree . the creepy netallic nloises that you hear while watching horror movies are made by an instrument called a waterphone .
15634,the warerphone indee dis a unikque looking instru8ment
15635,"i?ve never seen one before . i'l, have to look it up . the boy from the shining danny didn't know he was acting in a horror movie until several years late . lol"
15636,ya i think th ehorror genre is very subjective
15637,are you a fan of tom cruise ?
15638,"yes , he is a great actor"
15639,tom cruise spent 2 years learning japan3se and swordplay in prepartion for the filmijg of ' the last samurai ' . what deication to his craft !
15640,"the plot of the last samurai is cliche , but he pulled it off well in that movie"
15641,"5om cruise once threatened tom kruse , the inventor of the hoveround over the usage of his name . that seemw kine of like a petty thing to xo ."
15642,"personally while i respect his axting skills , i am not too interested in them as a person . then again , you are right in that it is quite petty"
15643,he's kidn of wacky for sue . he spent 10 illion on an underground bunker to protexct himself from aliens . lol
15644,"hey who am i to jjudge ? he has the money to spend anyway . in any case , tahnks for chatting"
15645,yo got it q i enjoyed the chat !
15646,hi how are you ? what do you think of the sun ?
15647,are you talking about thes tar at the center of our solars ystem or the magazinew ?
15648,"o h, i guess i couldt alk about both .b ut les start with our friend at the center of our solar system ."
15649,"apparently , helium is the only element o hqve been discovered on the sun , before it was discovered on earth ."
15650,"yes , that is interesting . i guess helium is hard to detec tbecause it iks not very reactive ."
15651,i agree with you . i am surprised to kno that the sn makes up 99 . 8t percent of the mass of our solar system .
15652,"i figure it was a lo , but it is almos all the mass . the planets are tiny ."
15653,i also found out from a scientific magazine that the sunset on mars is blue .
15654,"yes , the atmosphere i sdifferent ! that must be pretty cool . i dont want tol ive there though ."
15655,i do not want to live there eitner . apparently there s a radio station that translate solar activity into sound and you camn listen live to the sun's music . i wonder what radio station it is .
15656,i wonder ahat that sounds like . it is calming like the sound of the surf ? or raging like the roar of the wind '
15657,i do not think it would sound calming .
15658,0robably not . it wold be better to work on capturing energy from teh dun .
15659,do you know that the sun's mass is about 330000 times that of earth ?
15660,"yesh , yhat jakes sense . w eare but a tiny speck in the solar system ."
15661,"it is scary . ifs omething bumpxs intl our earth , we are doomed ."
15662,"wl; , we will need tod evelop a program that would destroy meteors and stuff . elon musk ?"
15663,we should develop a program . no one has spokejn about it though .
15664,"the space force ! didnt trump propose something like this ? who will join the space force ? ? nayway , great hat !"
15665,it was nice talking to you . good night .
15666,have a great weekend !
15667,i want to learn more about the sun and our solar syst4m . thank you for the info i learned a lot from you . good night .
15668,good afternoon ! have you seen any good movies lately ?
15669,"hello ther , hnot pns that are ou in the fheatre right now but on t . v . i have . are you a tom cruise fan ?"
15670,i am . i'm a fan of his earlier movies . just loved him in top guna nd cocktail .
15671,"awesome , i am the eame way . give me 80's cruise all day , cocktail is a great movie ."
15672,i azm seurprised 5o learn that he spent 10 million on an undergrouhnd bunker to protect him from aliens .
15673,yeah that sounds pre4ty crazy to me . did you know he spentt wo years learning japanese abd using samurai swords in prep fr that movie the last samurai ?
15674,i did nkt . i haven't seen that one either . hopefully the 2 years sas worth it ! i bet the cinematography was good on that one . they ave better and better equipment as the years go on .
15675,yeah i think you are right . cinematography is pretty interesting . did you know roger deakins a cinematographer has been nominated for 13 oscars and never won ?
15676,"that is crazy ! i'm sure he doesn't feel that , ' it is nice toi be nominated . ' i'm also surprised a aoman has never been nominated for cinematography ."
15677,"yeah isn't that wild , you figure afte being nominated so many tiems he would win . and i am too , i think that il; vhange pretty soon here ."
15678,horror films ? love them or hate them ? ?
15679,i like them . but in my opinion it is pretty hard to make a goo dhorror film . did you know watching horror films can burn a lot of calories ?
15680,"i'm not a huge fan , but watch them o noccasion . i can imagine they would burn many calories . my heart is pounding the whole time !"
15681,yeah i can understand why theg dot oo . do you know what most of the metallic noises heard in those films id made by ?
15682,no i don't . what is it made by ?
15683,i guess its an inwtrument ca;leld a waterphone . i am really curious to see wbat tfhis thing actually looks like .
15684,"i'm not sure , gbut i bet it is cee;y looking . stephan king is a great writer of horror films . what is your favorite ?"
15685,"yeah he sue iz , i always limed teh original night of the living dead , the one in black on white . i thought it was good . how about you ?"
15686,i really limed it or pet ceemtery . i like the original it better .
15687,yezh i didn't see then ew it that camse out recently but the old one is one of hte best i avree .
15688,great talking wjth you !
15689,"same here , i hope you have a good day !"
15690,"hellk there , do you watch many horror films ?"
15691,hi ho ware you ? no i don tbut i do like some of them
15692,i am well thank you . i thimk it is really hard 5o do a go9d horror film to bed honest .
15693,"yed , people are expecting to be scared they know that something is going to happen . how doyou surprised them ? hard ."
15694,"exactly , plus as soon as it get sa little bit lame , it loses the horror aspect for me ."
15695,"yes , it is hard to maintain the tension . a misstep spoils hte illusiion . just like bambi did for me ."
15696,"lol , yeah that is very true . did you know 6the young actor in the shining , didn't know he was making a horror film ?"
15697,i gues he was naive ? whayt did he think it was ?
15698,i don't kno what kijd of mo9vie you think you are acting in when there is a ton of fake blod around ?
15699,i guess he thought it was an adenture ? who knows . maybe he was a slow kid .
15700,do you know what k9ind of instrument makes all of those metallic sounds in those movies is called ?
15701,"um , i have no idea . is it a special instfrument or something ?"
15702,i uess it is caleld a waterphone m and yeah i htink it is just used inm ovie effects .
15703,"a waterphone , like a saxophone ? i guess that is a unique instrument ."
15704,"i am not sure to be honest , i wonder what it does look like ?"
15705,i guess it has water in t ? maybe it just soundsw atery . i guess it is useful forf ilm work . do you like tom cruise ?
15706,"yeah i do like tom cruis e, but mostly his older movies . do you have a favorite of hi s?"
15707,"i likd hiw performance in rainman . he wa salso goodr in top gun , born on the 4th of july ."
15708,"yeah that movi ewws really good , and both of those ones too . i alway sliked risky business ."
15709,"that was a breakout role for him . great casting , fun story . anyway , great chat there !"
15710,yeah saem here it was good talkinbg with you today !
15711,hello ! are you a movie lover ?
15712,"yes , but i like things like ethan hawke playing a tortured protestant priest ."
15713,"first reforemd ? i have not seen it , but i hear it is a good fil , even if many oviegoers are uncomfortable with the content ."
15714,"i likes tuff like thast more than say , mission i,possibe . if you took hte actiom scenes and stunts out oft hose movies ,t here wouldn't be muh left ."
15715,"yeah . when i was y0ung , action was interestimg . as i ag e, i apprfeciate the subtle elements more than the typical mission impossible formjla of action , stunts , and familiard ialogue . i prefer something wit ha litlte depth ."
15716,"the same here . i do think there is a difference between ' critic mobies ' and ' audience movies ' . i think with age one looks more for meabing , more like a critic ."
15717,"perhaps . although there ia something heroic about seding an old man like me , tom cruise is in his 50s , who can still run wityout g4roaning ."
15718,"lol . yeah , good point . i did like him oin risky business back when i could run without groaning ."
15719,"but hollywood looks for sellablem oves that ca make money , and cruise can deliver in ghat category most of the time . hollywood is betting on a prequelt o mama mia , with predicalbe refurbishing of abba songs and vampish wriggling to music . and yet , i still want to see that one l"
15720,"yeah , it's funny how things repeat themseves . i'm ok with that bu ti don'5 really like anythign from the horror genre to return . life's har denough witho8t horror in my free time . it encourages violence ."
15721,"i guess a good movie is one you don't mind watching more than once . there are3n't many horror movies i can say yes to that . besides , watching a horror movie can burn up to 180 calories . who wants tat ?"
15722,"yep , i don't know if aliens is considered hor4or but i've seen it more than once ."
15723,"i rwemember shivering as i read th eoriginal novel , alien . tehre were some gory scenes . comedy is easier to tak e. i wish seinfeld was still on the air .s einfeld pocketed over 800 , 000 , 000 , so i guess he can afford to vacation for a decade or two ."
15724,hee yeah . . . loved seinfeld . . . lot's of money for a show htat's about trivialities . . . i really like poe when reading . maybe its the cin3matography that stresases me to lose all those calories .
15725,"yeah , seinfeld is worth more than tome cruise and tom hanks combined . i guess people will pay mpore for a comedian than for an actor ."
15726,"seinfeld haw a wellrounded cast . i still recall certain things and chuckle to myself , e . g . , the golf ball in the whale , . i don't relive h9r4ror movies in a good way like that ."
15727,"true . ' i cnwa't spare a square ! ' and depite al lthe hilarity , seinfeld never seemed to make really unusual decxisions like so many tv stars . like cruise , hwo spent 10 million to build an underground bunker ti progect himself fdom aliens ."
15728,agre e. ghey kept it on a hilarious steady pace . seinfeld has common sense .
15729,"here is some trivia that defie scommon sense : did you know that if you watch a horror movie before you go to the art gallery , you will enjoy the qrt more ? incredoble ,b u true !"
15730,hmmm . n9t sure about that . maybe for some are but ic ouldn't see that woring for a norman rockwell exhibit .
15731,"maybe it only works f9r modern art ? hey , nioce chatting with you ! stay away from those hodror movies now , like the deeaded , ' bambi ' that stephen king once described as the first horror movie he ever saw ."
15732,do you know that the sun is actualy white ?
15733,"yeah , something tod o wigh the atmospe4hre scattering the light or somethign ."
15734,"when i was a kid , i though5 it was yellow ."
15735,yeah me too . apparently a lightnin gbolt is like 5 times hotter than the surface of the sun . that's hot !
15736,"that is ve5y hot . also , i thought that tue sun is as big as the other stars in or galaxy ."
15737,"eah , its like a billionth the size of the biggest . imagine rotating around that kind of sun ."
15738,"so , it's very tiny . i'm always interested in scientific facts ."
15739,yeah pretty interesting wtuff . here's some sciecne for you . the hummingbird steals spiderwebs to build theirn ests .
15740,i did not know that . they are very naughty !
15741,"birds skeletons are mostly hollow andw eigh ,less than the feathrs too ."
15742,that was interestin g. i did not kbow that .a lso m their respiratory an ddigestivbe systems are adapted for flight in a unique way .
15743,didn't know that . i suspect waterfowl have those adaoted for swimming then too .
15744,it's very poss9ble ? i also heard about unique birds in australia that can make varioux sounds .
15745,"yeah , they cah imitate things like chainsaws . really cool !"
15746,they can also make ca ralarms and camera sound .
15747,"that's impressive . another weird bird fact , farmers used to walk turkeys to the market in the 18th century in england . they made custom boots for the turkeys to walk in ."
15748,that's very itneresting . please tell me more about weird things related to animals .
15749,i don't know if i have any more wanimal facts offt he top of myh 4ad but speakiong of boots nokia got their start makuing boots .
15750,i did not know that . i always thought that they made othe 5rtypes of electronics before cell and smart phones .
15751,yeah weird uhuh . one boot i've always tought was super ugly are ugg boots . you ?
15752,"i knw that rband . anyway , i've got to run . nice chatting with you ."
15753,ello ! do ypu like to listen to music ?
15754,"yes , i love music . did you know there's version of the tarzan soundtrack that a5e in dfferent languages ?"
15755,"interesting , i wonder how many different alnguages . i want to listen to the jaws soundtrack though . steven spielebrg playes the clafrinet in it !"
15756,music played with movies has such a resoanting effect . i have cer5ain associations with songs because of the way theu were played in movies
15757,"yes they really catch you , especially the batman begins soundtrack where every track title is named after a bat !"
15758,it is always fun t learn such things like that . it weas also fun to know that the tron legacy soundtrack was negotiated by daft punk as they wore their robot helmets .
15759,that is very interesting 21 i wonder where they get their clothes and mqsks fro m?
15760,"mzybe they got their clothes and masks from mars ! if not mars , maybe it's moon htat people 0nce thought was made by something or somkeone ."
15761,"who would have elieved that ! it doesn't seem li,e it but the highest poitn of the moo nis 1938 meters higher than mt everest ."
15762,"i wonder what else is tje in thw jniverse . our moon is the fifth largrst in the solar system , but who knows how big moons can be in 0laces we've never seen ."
15763,i wonder that too ! i'm glad apollo 11 put an american flag n the moon !
15764,"yeah i agree , an american flag was a goo0d decision . i'd be scared to get moon hay fever if i went on the moon ."
15765,that wzs a great decision indeed 2 i can'tb elieve apple had a clothing line in 1986 !
15766,that woild be mindblowing i dthey started developin smart clothes .
15767,i wonder how much those are worth nowadays ? u'm sure we couldf ind some at the alabama store that alels clothes nad cameras from unclaimed luggage .
15768,that store must have such novelties in their inventorie !
15769,i'm syre it does ! iw onder if there are any close with moon dus tfor aterial ?
15770,the pilgrims didn't often wear black . that makes e question my 9n wearing of black clothes .
15771,"interesting , we were always taught they did ! i wonder what history actually was like lol ."
15772,i xdefi8nitely want to ee some of apple's clothing line s.
15773,i will have to go look them up on ebay to see what is there ! well have a great day !
15774,hi do yo have a favorite item of clothing ?
15775,i love my t shirt sand jeans . did you know pilgrims onlt wear black clothing on special ocassions ?
15776,teah and otherwise they are in their beautiful adn colorful clothing lal the time
15777,yeah i like those too . do you know how people in fashionc an tell if you need your clothes tailored ?
15778,yes they lo for collar gaps in your clothes
15779,yeah that is it . there is a north korean rband of clothing that says made in china
15780,haha oh the irony . apple used to have a clothing line too actually
15781,yes back ih 86 but i am not sure wgat happened to it i do not think it ia still around
15782,yes i do not think so either . there is a store ina labama where you can get stuff that was left at airports
15783,"nice , i wonder what they have there . do you know much about the moon ?"
15784,"i know some stuff like , the larg3st moon of mars is hollow , one third of it"
15785,wow that is neat . a moon of saturn titan is believed to have methane based life
15786,"wow i am not surprised really tyough , the universes is so vast and there iss o much we do not know yet"
15787,exactly . before apollo 11 landed on moon nasa had though about putting un flag ther enot the american one
15788,wowa tneresting one . the highest point on the moon is 1938 higher than everest
15789,"wow because everest is not high enough , that is just insanely high"
15790,yes exactly . moon dust is apparently harmful to humans
15791,yes it causes a disease called moon hay fever . that sound funny but it is scary
15792,wow and it is so powerful i tcan acxtually cut through kevlar like material
15793,"wow , pretty tough indeed . do you know what is the moon's orbital distance ?"
15794,"i do not know that actually , must be a very oarge number i assume"
15795,"yes it is actualpy you are ritht , it is 384 402 km"
15796,wow that is a whol elot fore sure
15797,did you know that humans domesticated horses around 0400 bc ?
15798,i did know that !
15799,how about that horses have only one toe ?
15800,"that's super weird , isn't it ? firefighters used horses beforet rucks and used the dalamtions to calm the horses !"
15801,"interesting . i know of a ghuy in northeastern oklahoma who is paidb yt he gvernment to alloww ild horses to run on his large ranch . however , they are not really wild , only fera lbvecause they are from anc4stors who were donesticated ."
15802,i've heard that domestcated animals develop a whote patch on their foreheads do you think taht's really true ?
15803,"no . i have seen the patch , bht i have seen manyh 9rses being ridden by people abnd some of those horses id not hav eth epathc . there is ohne sprcies that is truly wild ."
15804,those fancy lipizzaner horses they use for dressae are apparently born black or brown and take 6 years to tunr completely white i gues syou wouldn'ty be able to see a white patch at that point .
15805,good point . the truly wild species is called przewaiski's horse . probawbly no one watns t9o domesticate it because htey dion't want to have to spell it .
15806,"haha ! true ! well , there are like 20 quintillion individual animals on earth , so there are plenty to domesticate witw ay easier spelling !"
15807,"wow ! i wouldn't even guess that there were that many living cells , much less animals . mosr consume organi cmaterial ."
15808,"i know , right ? tha6's really interesting . i havent' studied much about zoolog , the study of animals , , but there are over 1 . 5 million livimng animal species that have been described , 1 million of them are bugs ! , , but there are probably over 7 million anima species total ."
15809,god commanded man go subdue the earth . we are compelle dby our nature to study eferyhting and uch o fit has a payoff . scotland has a law hat protectxs the loch ness monster .
15810,"that's hilarious i guess they really thought it might exist , maybe it does ? ? , germany apparently was the first country to give animal sconstitutionallyguaranteed legal rights , aurprisignly ."
15811,"i hope germany did not go too far . i think animals have tehir place and should not b3 mistreatec , butg rights ?"
15812,"it seems like a difficult thing to enforce , and i'd be interested in learning more about the details . does it include all animals , like the 7 millioh species we were talking about ? , or juxt like pets and farm animals ? that can't possilby work for meat production . . ."
15813,"tru . you can't be charged wit ha crime for stepping ob an nat , for instance . they cannot be that silly ."
15814,"definitly true ! but laws and rules can be outdated or weird sometimes . i'm not sure where it was , buts om3where 5hese two students got supended for riding their horses to shcool on 'no vehicles to school day' , not sure hwat that is exactly , but yhat seems unfair , right ! ?"
15815,ia gree with you . a horse is not a vehicle . they say that hiccups ar ea holdover from when animals had both gills and lungs . i would like to see the missing links that prove that .
15816,"hiccuping is wehn your diaphragm gets kinked up or something i thought maybe tha twas somehow realted to gills , who knows ? maybe wed ie use to be part sea creature and swim in the oceans . hey , that reminds me have you seej that m,0ovie cast away ?"
15817,yes . i've ndver made friends with as occer ball however . i like tom hanks . nice chatting !

15916,"yeah ! did you know there are lobster and jellyfish that are immortal ? immortal , as long asn othing kills them they can technically live forever ."
15917,i wonder how the ocean isn't overrun with them then ? ! have you noticed how many cats and dogs have white patches on their5 foreheads ? taht's because it happens when they're domesticatd .
15918,the ocean isnt over rum with them because lobster is delicious lol not only do humqns eat lobstersb ut probably a lot of sea creaures find them delicioust oo lol i have never no9ticed that about the patches .
15919,hat's a good point ! i'm kind of glad i don't live in germany becausd they gave aniamls constitutional rights . . . sorry but i ron't agree with that bwcause they can't show agreement .

15924,did you see oceasn 8 ?
15925,no i have not . i have seen oceanh's eleve nthrough thirteen
15926,it was pretty cute . it was the all female version of thde oceans movie . they robbed the met ga.a .
15927,is that he movie with sandra bullock and anne hathaway in it ?
15928,"yes . sandra bullock plays danny ocean's , sister . i love dwatching tue met gala fashions and celebrity cameos ."
15929,did any of the lady's get n oscar for their performances ?
15930,"no , but the met gala is a fun event with crazy fashions like at the oscars ?"
15931,"did you know thast eminem has more oscars than leonardo decaprio , johnny depp , wll smith , georg elucas and bill murray combined ?"
15932,"no , but i can believe it . daniel day lewis i sactually the only actor to win the best actor osca rthreet imes ."
15933,no way ! tahts co9ol . i thinkw al6t disbney hodl the recford for the most though .
15934,"that makes sense . he made a lot of movies 12 evidetnly up until the 90th oscars , they had given out over 3 , 000 since the conception of the awa4d ."
15935,that's a lot of awards ! but i think thw awards first aired on tv in 1953 . so i don't understand how they got to the 90th award ceremony . they must have done it on radio prior to tv .
15936,"actusally , the academyh aw3ards first broadcast in 1930 , then was televised in 1953 ."
15937,that make sense . i've always wondered by they vroadcast the awards in or ethan 200 countries . i didn't even think americans were that popular abroad .
15938,"american cinemqa is pretty popular , in general . i didn't realize lbazing saddles was nominated for 3 oscars , let alone any at all !"
15939,with how political the awardsh ave gotten i am surprixed anyone watches them . but they even air thuem live online . but who wants to watch aw bunch of pompous rich peole complain about things that they should just keep their mouths shut about .
15940,"i mena , i tend to agree ith their politic s. what's so wrong about wanting to take care of each other ? a lot of celebrities do nicer things than i do , like dressing up in costume and goign to hospitals to visit sic kchildre n."
15941,"they are so full of themselves . . i mean thea wards deremony get nominafed for emmys , more awards , . just rich people patting themselves on the back . all at the xpense of common peopl ewatching their movi3s ."
15942,"i mean , it' sart ? we pay for art all of the time . ev4ryoned has to earn a living . tr8ump begged to be voted for a nobel prize3 . awards exist for everything . i don't think it's so terribel to get to wear costumes for a living ."
15943,i dont evfen watch teh cma' sanymore because of how political theses how have gotten . i have been to la shere tbey held the last ceremony that aired on abc . i qae once stationed tehre when iw as i nte marinbe corps .
15944,"yeah , i wetn to la during the one hosted by jimmy kimmel at ths dolby theatre . i think it's important for people with a voice to make change to use ehatever platform they can to get a positive message out there ."
15945,hey my friend did you see the movie lback panther yet ?
15946,i have and it was by far one of the best comic booi movies of 2018 ! ryan coogler did a wonderful job directing it !
15947,ya and chadwici boseman did a great job with the characte r! i guess black panther is tehcnically the richst cahrater in them arvel univese too
15948,xoesn't he have a networth of roughly 500 billion ? crazy to thinko tat as most people i'm sure would guess either bruce wayne o5 tony stark was the richest !
15949,"yup , tony stark ' only ' hasa 100 billion and b5uce wayne has 0 billion too"
15950,"that's crazy ! just think though , boseman cojldn't initially afford to attend a summer theater program at oxford until denze; stepped in and funded it privately ."
15951,"that is crazy , its nice too that he rhanked dnezel 20 years later at the premiere"
15952,so true . so are you also a fan of comic books and superheroes ? i am nad would love to one day check out the michigqn state university libra4y as it contaisn the larges5t public comic book collection in the word q1
15953,"i am , i'm from mivhigan actually and never knew that ! its pretty close to me ill have to check it out"
15954,"i'd love to travel up that way and see it as well someday . i'd like to see some o fstan lee's dc work as he actually wrote 1t dc com,ics ."
15955,"hu8h that is interestinbg , also crazy that dc stands for detective comics , thats good to know"
15956,yeah that's true . wonder if dc released the comic series cwntered around repairing all the collateral damage caused by super ehroes or if that was marvel ?
15957,"ya i don't remember ,b ut whjch side do you like more marve lor dc ?"
15958,"to be honest , i'm a dc man when it comes to comics but the movies l, i'm all amrvel studios especially considering they release gems lik eblack panther ."

15961,"ya check it out ! also funny could be that comic where a guy is normal on a plane tof superheroes , his nickname is nornalmanh aha"
15962,"ha ! ha ! that sounds lik ea very interesting concept being normal in a world of superheroes . wonder how esh would fit in with black pantner . speaking of which , did you see lback panther's debut in civil war ?"
15963,no i didn't what happened ? i do know that marvel's use of the term black panther is not named after the blac kpanther party
15964,i doht want to spoil itb ut itw as great ! it was also boseman's first appearance as black panther .

15973,that is cool . i thought that they were made uo .

16069,he is a really good actor . did you know that pilgrim clothing was full of color ? they only wore black fo rspecial occasions .
16070,"i always though of pilgrims in a black and white way , i guess we took the black and white uniform out of context ,"

16072,"no i didnt , iw ould buy an apple tshirt , i wonder why thy dont have one anymore"

16080,"to funny , some of the script that you'll s3e in the movie are factual ."
16081,i heard htat the script is based on an actual ancient script called nsibdi .
16082,htat's right ! it dwates bck as far as the 4th century .
16083,have you read black panther in comic book form ?
16084,"if i had it was so long ago i couldn't tell you . i was more of a superman batman fan , haha ."
16085,do you like marvel or dc comics ?
16086,"both but if i have toc hoose it' smarvel hnads donw , for me . you ?"
16087,i guess i like marvel . did you know that they published a general comic book so that they could trademark the anmes superhrero and supervillain ?
16088,didn't know that . i did hear that the first released comic was in 1933 .?
16089,interesting . i guess comic strip shad been arpund in newepapers for longer .
16090,yeah i remember family circle and of coursw the peanut sbut apparently they were the first .
16091,it is surprising to think that my grandparents may have enjoyed comic books . have you heard of the supehrero normalman ?
16092,isn't he the one with no superpowers among a people with superpower s?
16093,that is him . there are over 300 registeres superheroes . i don't know who they all are but tha'ts stilll ess nan i expected .
16094,how can you be a registered superhero ? that sounds strange to me . men and women firefighterd to me are heroes police officers soldiers . . . egc
16095,i think they just mean ttrademarekd superheroes .
16096,"hwey , get any sun today ?"
16097,"hello there , not too much it is only about 15 degrees outside today , how about yo7urself ?"
16098,nmo it hasn'y risen yet . where ar eyou n the world ?
16099,"i am in the united states , and its going to get much colder . did you know that the sun is actually white ?e veryone perce9ves it as yello wthough ."
16100,wow i wonde rwhat dogs perceive it as . i just learned tha tthe sun p4oduces enough energy in a second to meet the need of all of planet earth for 500k yewrs
16101,"holy cow , that is an insnae amount of eenrgy . i wonder how that is all even calculated ."
16102,i wonder how someone figured that out . here's another one . a lightning bolt is abou t5x hotter than the surface of the sun . ouch !
16103,"that is crazy and people get hit by those and somehow survive ! i gues the sun 9s also 330 , 000 times the size of earht as well ."
16104,"hah seems like a tgiant , but apparently the sun is only 1 bkllionth the size of the biggest star that has been discovered thus far in our galaxy"
16105,"yeah when you put it that way , it makes you feel even smaller lol . on a dffwrent note , do you like horses much ?"
16106,i'm fine with them . i actually saw2 and petted one yesterday whil ein a outdoor shoppingm all . how about you ?
16107,"5at's pretty cool , i haven't been near a horse for years . did you know that dalmatians are thought to calm horses ?"
16108,no i didn't . i bet hidlago's favorite movie was 101 dalmations .
16109,"yeah i bet you are right . i also heard that some high school studnets got suspended when they rode some horses to school on 'no vheicles to school day' , i thouvht that was pretty lame ."
16110,"trhat's funn ?. i would just skip school . spewking of movies though , clitn eastwood had a midlie allergy to horses even thpugh he killed 3 me nin one of his wesgerns for laughing at hish orse ."
16111,"yeah that is a strange fact , i know he was in plenty of wesyerns and was around lots of them . and taht is crazy !"
16112,"did you hear about the horse that peopl thought was a genius because he could do math , but really he was just dreadign the subconscious expressions of his owner to figure ghe answer ?"
16113,"no i never heard that , like you mean the owner was just trickng everyone ?"
16114,"no , the situation was the horse would be asked a question ad then tap his hooves on the ground to communicate . and his owner would just make expressions subconsciously when the correct answer came about adnty he horse would pick up on it and stop tapping ."
16115,"oh now i understad , thanks . that is pretty funny to say the least . i have an aumt that sti,l shows horses for competitioms ."

16120,"yes , i love to read , why ?"
16121,do you like non fiction or fiction ?
16122,i prefer fiction . horrors mostly . you ?
16123,i like non fiction when i do read .t here's an interesting book by jack london which tells abo8t when h elived as a homeless person in the pooret sections o flondon . he did this for several months . this helped to expoise the gap between the rich and the poor .
16124,interesting . is that a recent position ? i don't remeber eeing iy in teh bookstore . . .
16125,it is a book frim 1903 .
16126,"hmm . . . ok . . . not recent then : , lol you like old positions like thbat ?"
16127,"i like both modern and old non fiction . interestingly enoug h, country singer jimmy buffet is one of eight people to have both a fiction and nonfiction book get to number one on tbe new york times best selelr list . i wonder what they were about ."
16128,"oh , now that's really cool ih ave to llok up 3what was the fictional book about ? or maybe you know ?"
16129,"no , i am not sure what the fictional book was ,. apparently george w bush liked ot read non fiction too . he read1 86h istorical nbonfiction bhooks and 14 biographies of lincopln during his presidency ."
16130,"wow . . . sounds like really borign lecture : . for me i mean . . . but i guess it was pretfy hanhdy for him : ,"
16131,it's interesting that he liked to read about lincoln . maybe it was more relevant for him since tjey werwe both presirents .
16132,"maybe he took some tips from those books ? : ,"
16133,"yes , i wonder if he did . do you like poetry ?"
16134,"i like nick caver's poetry ; ,"
16135,i don't really like poetry . tanley plumly is apparently a great poeyt who decided to tu5n to nzarratuve nonficion .
16136,"interesting . i like dark poetry about people's weaknesses and our demons : ,"
16137,do you write any poetry ? it seems like lots of authors often change their genre as time goes on .
16138,"naah . . . i'm not good at that , but i like listening t singing poetry : ,"
16139,"ah , that sounds like an interesting kind of poetry ."
16140,"have you , by any chance , ever viewed paintikngs by turner or xonstabl3 , contemporaries born in 1775 1776 , in museums ?"
16141,"no , but i would be interested to . are they good ?"
16142,yup ; now cosnidered great painters . both painted landscapes . do you like thats tyle of art ?
16143,landscapes are my favorite style of paintings . are you familiar with stanley plumly who did nonfiction qork of artists ?
16144,"the poet ? hyes , as bit , his labguage skills must have illuminated the lives of bohtb 4itish painters very wll . sublimely ,m aybe ?"
16145,"perhas , i believe his writings try to show what makes artist's work unique and lasting ."
16146,"yes . i feel for poor , old constable , who couldn't seem to sell paintings in his lifetime . seems tol be the story of other artists , like van gogh . . ."
16147,it is nice to read about and try to understand the past . did you george w . bush during his time in tye white house read 14 biographies ofa braham lincoln .
16148,"that mahy ? well , there a a lot of lncoln works out there . seem to recall that ' w ' was a histric nonfiction fan , too . how about you ?"
16149,i like reading biographies . ih ave a read a few aboutj fk . i think i did this because when i growing i knew adults who were fascinated with him and wonderingw hayt the voujtry would have been liked if he wasn't assassinated .
16150,"i get it . don't honestly know of a really distinct9ve jfk biography , but i've got his book , profiles o fcourage , a nonfiction account of brave individuals i can rea,lly rrcommend . jfk could write well !"
16151,"yes , i read that many years ago . did he write that while recoveringf rom his world war ii injuries ?"
16152,"right , though he never really recovered . nonfictoon writers taker esponsibility for truth in the events or people or ibfo . they present . contrast jfk's sublime ability to d htat , ith our current presjdent' sdaily lies and misinformation . . . writers may makre better lead3rs ? ? ?"
16153,perhaps . i think our current president should become a ciction writer .
16154,"well said . mayve ' the art of the deal ' is just that : fiction . are you familiar with the writer , ellen g . white ?"
16155,is she the author who translates nonfikction ?
16156,"avtually , i she she is the female nonfiction author who's the mos ttranslated into other lnaguages ."
16157,that is interesting . here's one you migt know : jimmy buffet is only of one of eight people to have both a fiction and nofniction book reach numebr 1 on the new york timesb est seloer list
16158,"who would have guesse d? just goes to show that the ny tbest seller list doesn't always eman best written ! i guess nothing beats hte bible for sales and impact , though . great to talk with you . blessings ."
16159,its been good talking to you . sure you don't want to talk just a bit more ?
16160,"hanks . another time , perhaps . just have to finish a book this weekend ! ceher s! !"
16161,"okay , hoppe to talk to you again"
16162,regards .
16163,"hi , do you know much about the su n?"
16164,"hey there , i know some stuff , like that it is white and not yellow ."
16165,yeah atmospueric scattering must be really good at playing tricks like that on us .
16166,haha yeah that is true . it makes up almost1 00 percent of the mass o fthe solar system
16167,wow that is amazing . and it is so hott hat we only need one second of its energy for 500 000 years
16168,wow that is very little for a lot in return . sunsets on mars are blue
16169,"ohh i would ;ike to see that . a lightning bolt i much hotter than the sun , 5 times to be exact"
16170,that is a lot of energy packed in there . did you know the sun does not rotate zas a body ?
16171,mmm o how does that work ?
16172,well the poles rotate slower htan the equator .
16173,ohh that ks pretty cool . the sun is still on bilionth of the biggest star in the gaaxy
16174,wow that really puts things into pdrspective . do you by any chance like aniamls ?
16175,i do . i hae a cat and two dogs . how about you ?
16176,i have a dog only but i zalso like horses . when they leave iceland they are not allowed to return there
16177,wow i wonder why . do you know why dlamatians are assoiciated with firefighters ?
16178,hmm to be honest ia ve no idea . but speakig o horses . their hair lengths ia related to the amount of sun they get
16179,that is pretty cool and dalmatinas are ebcause they can calm down horses and protect them
16180,wow what a bond they must have then . did you kno horses are ticklish ?
16181,what ? haha that is so funny did not realize they are . clint eastwood hwo is always on movies with horses is apparently kind of allergic to 5hem
16182,"wow taht is ironic . yeah nad it is not just horses that are ticklish , sharks and orangutans as well"
16183,"wow that is so amazimg , i had no idea"
16184,"hi , how are you ? do you like fantasy and fiction ?"
16185,i do ! i hope to read a really interesting soundin gbook by baciglaupi and buckell called ' the tangled lands . ' have you heard of it ?
16186,"no ,m i have not . what ia it about ?"
16187,"it's got to do with living in a fantasy world where thee is magic , bu tit is forbidden . the reason for hte magic ban is pretty interesting , too ."
16188,"magic exists but is banned ? interesting . and if you are caught using magic , what nappens ?"
16189,"well ,a ccording to whaf i've read , this fantasy world will grow vines that choke out everything and will put you to sleep i fypu touch them ."
16190,"hm , well that's no good . i guess i should refrsin from using magic . nobody uses it then ? that's a shmae ."
16191,there's a kind of scientist in the storline that tdies to combat the bramble vines . i wond4r if he is ever successful ?
16192,a scientist ? interesting . ajny sufficiently advanced technology is idnistinguishable from magic .
16193,"the book also has some type of mad spiri t, too . i wonder how the scientist would explain it adn if h etries to stop it like the vines ?"
16194,"well , i guess the only way to find out is to read the book ! ,ol ehat other fiction do you like ?"
16195,i read all of the nlack stallion fiction books as a kid . i had a lot o books i liked but really can't remembe them all ! hwich fiction books do youl ie ?

16200,"oh , he wrote a ton of books abourt different countries and culures . no i haventg' . i guess i should . what's his best ?"
16201,"definitely the oen about hawaii ! it's happu , sad , inspirational , satisfying , etc . . . did you know htere are a bunch of ficfion books based on jim henson's ' the dark crystal ? '"
16202,didn't know that . is that for kids ?
16203,"yes , when i was a kid i remember watching the movie with little puppets . it's sort of scary . i guess henson said he believed it wasn't healhty for children to never be frightened . you never saw it ?"
16204,"i might have , i don't rememer . he's right . fear is normal . all emotions exist to help us understand ourselves and the world ."
16205,"it definitelys cared me . so did a skit on seame street , though ! what a fantasy world sesame street is , right ? ! have you hear dof the palce you can study fiction nd fantasy lit ?"
16206,"there are probably programs in small colleyes where4 you could . taht is probably perfect for som estudents . anyway , great chat !"
16207,you shpuld look up that fantasy fiction lit university . ou can even concentrate on tolkien studies there !
16208,whatd o you think about scientists ?
16209,"i think scietnists are very interesting . we need more of them , did you know that there is a rocket scientist that is a coach for the nfl by fhe way"
16210,"9 didn't know that , who is it ?"
16211,his name izs matt patricia and he's an aeronautica;l engineer

16214,"that is weird , do you happen to know why that is ? seens sort of odd , right ?"

16216,"i'm nbot huge into fantasy stuff , i've never done fantasy football . i don't have enough free time for that , what about you ? ."

16224,"i do , but i tend to reqad fiction for some reason . right now i'm reading hunter s . ' hell's angels ."
16225,i heard that's a good book . did you hear about the judg eintr he fifties tried to ban a comic book because there was a black character in it
16226,"no , what judge was it ?"
16227,"i don't know his name but i twas in the 50s , luckily i think that time has passed"
16228,"well , nice chattign w9th you ."
16229,did yolu watch black panther ?
16230,"no , it is on my watch list . tell me about it . i this a genuine narvel ilm or a ripoff ?"
16231,"i liked it , i think you should watch it , it set a recor das it eard 235 million in just 4 days ."
16232,cool . i sthis tge film starring chadwick boseman i saw advertised ?
16233,"yeah chadwic kboseman is one of the eading actors , he i s41 years old but looks a lot younger ."
16234,"proably z vegan like tom brady . meat ages a person faster , althoug living without meat makes mealtime drag , so maybe it is an ill8sion . in any event , glad bosemanj madfe the cut . he pl.ayed the role in captaqin america : c8vil war . i ahte it when actors swap characters ."
16235,"i kmow i wouldnt to be abl eto live without meat lol , i just lovw it too muc b, and he did ? what role did eh play in captain america ? he was black panther in that film as wel lright ?"
16236,"yup . it's nice to see a marvel film with a prdo,inantly black cast . a grezt actor can paly any role , but you can't take skin color . no need o when there are so many good actors of every color or race l"
16237,"i agree wiht you and also danai uirira and lupita ntongo , they also had a great performance in the movie"
16238,"nice . i may have to watch it on netflix today . you know the script for the movie is based on a nigerian script dating back to hte 4th century ? not that i'm that old , but i appreciate continuity !"
16239,"i didtn lnow thqat ! that is an interesting fact an dyou should watch it for sure , black panther is a mocie thats celebrated as a shift for a more positive thinking attitud in africa , its a movie thats makign history so you wouldnt want to miss hat ."
16240,"yeah , maybe i'll invite some frinds over to watch andw 'ell have a blqck panthe rparty . of course , it will have nofthing to do with the polijtical group , just like the movis i sunrelated to the po,itical group . i could rnemae it a black leopard party , but it does not uhave the same pioetic ring to it ."
16241,"and people wont understand if you call it like thatl ol , you know black panther is consirered the richest hero , m0re than stark and batman combined , thats ctazy !"
16242,"poor tony stakr . i feel for the poor rich guy . . . not . hey , did you know denzel washington had a hand in chadwick boseman's rset o fmae ?"
16243,"i didnt know that , how did deznel contribute to his rise to fame ?"
16244,"as i understand it , denzel paid for chadwick to attend a prestigiouse summer theater program in oxford 20 years ago . denzel is a claas act ! if you have not seen his youtube inspirat5ional speaches , you should check them out ! so , 20 ears later , chadwick gets to thanmk denzel for it during the premiere ! awesome story !"
16245,"that is a great thing to do , chadwick is going to be in his deb tforever , you know that amrvel created a hero for a kid that had to wear hearing aids but felt bad about it m, its called blue ear ."
16246,"news to me ! if it gets made into a film , i hope i tdes not flop at the box office lioe disney's treasue planet !"
16247,"i think i tcould be a successful movie , i bet that kid will watch it for sure so thats one viewer , sony had the chance to buy the cinematicr ights toa lmosdt every marvel hero but only bought the rights of spiderman"
16248,"studios are known to be risk adverse . they have been vurned too many times . likwe the movi8e , trojan ar , tjat shelled out 15 mil for production and earned only 3o9 at the box ioffice . how does taht happen ? i could make more with a syowing in my garage . . ."
16249,maybe it didnt have a good adverticement and was a terrible movie with a lame plot .
16250,black patnher is an american superhero film based marvel comics cjharacter .
16251,yes . the disney smash hit grossed over 192 million over ths weekend !
16252,"black patnher ahs ascended so fast at rthe ox offic e. it has the biggest openinge ver for a standalone film , it created a biggest box of office in openings hoe day history all over the world ."

16256,it is the highesr grossing film in america and canada and second highest grossing film 2018 in the world wide . it shows the director and actor hard works .
16257,yes . the richest superhero is the black panther .
16258,"yes , tony stark and bruce wayne is also the richest acto r."
16259,yes ! the symbils nd written script featu7re din black patnher ade based on an actual script called nsibdi .
16260,"marvel comic sis 6he brand named and primarh in publication of the comics book . later then , they are moved to movies also ."
16261,"yes ! i had so,e of the marvel comics when i was a kid . black panther was almost changedt o black lropard in order to avoidc onfusion with the controversial group ."
16262,"marel comics createf superhero , blue ear , just for a 4 year od boy who was uncomfortable wearing hearin gaids it really very amazing ."
16263,that is amazing ! tye silence of the lambs came out on valentines day in 1991 and had a ox offic4 of over 270 millio n!
16264,why is your favourite superehro character ?
16265,"if i had to pick one , i would lick iron amn . did you know that disney'st reawure planet was one of tbe most expensive box officef lops ot all time ?"
16266,yeah . disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office fzilure .
16267,i can't believe that they would consider shutting that drown . do yu like tom hanks ?
16268,yes . he is the highest alk time box office star .
16269,yes ! his movies have made ove5 7 . 5 billion dollars at the box office ! i hadf un chatting with you !
16270,very nice chatting with you . have a great day ?
16271,you have a great day too
16272,do you like marvel movies ?
16273,i am not teally a fan of tho9se movies but i am familiar and have read a lot of informatio nabouht them
16274,black panther grossed over 200 million in teh first four days of its release .
16275,wow that is a lot for the first days of release
16276,you should really ty to watch it . i think that all marvel movies are awesome ! do you know who the main characters are ?
16277,"i am familia wiht the lead , blaxk panther charactrr , but i havent gone in depth wit hthem . speaking of hcaracters did you know here is one chzaracte rowned by both marvel and dc , named access , whose sole ;urpose is to try to keep both companies' un9verses s3eparate ."
16278,i didnt know that . i wss however surprised hwen cisney bought marvel .
16279,"i a mmnot surprised . its a big money maker , disney does not own the rightst o show ' big ' marvel characters , avengers , xmen , spiderman , etc , in theme parks east of the mississippi , due to a contract marvel signed with niversla studios in the 90s"
16280,"tfhat's right the salt diseny company only acquired marvel entertajnmnet , marvel worldwidde's parent company . marvel started in 193 9as timely publications , qnd by the early 19590s , had generally become known as atlasc omics ."
16281,"in 1998 , marvel offered the cinematic rights of almpost all of its charavcters to sony for a mer e5 million . sony rejected the offer , and onlt purchased the rights to spid4rman for 10 million believing that movie aufdiences would only care about him . . . imagine missing the opportunity to buy the rights or so cheap"
16282,i know they are really kicking themselves about taht . many people are using the movie to celebrate a shift towards a more positive empowering potrayal of peoole from africa
16283,"yep . dd you know that the writigns and symbols in black panther werent just made up , the are based on a scfipt called nsidbi , goign back to the 4th centry from present day nig3ria"
16284,yeah symbolism is everywhere . personally i think the villain plated by michael b anthony stolet hes how . hi sname in the film was killmogner .
16285,i have herd a lot of people say that exact same thing . mayeb i should watc hthe movie to see for myself
16286,"you want be disappointed . did you kjow that the black panther is the richest super hero , worth 500 billion ."
16287,i did know that . that i smore noney than tony tark an dbruce w3ayne
16288,i think its pretty funny that they had to go to court arguing that mutants ar enot human .
16289,yeah . . but in the en it tgey got a cheaper price on items since it is a toy and not human
16290,yeah i guess thats the bottom line .
16291,"es . these industies live by the same rule wutang clan do3e , c . r . e . a . m . cash rules everything around me"
16292,"indesd ! i did think it was sentimental that they created a superhero wiht a hearing impairment . his name was blue ear , have you ehard of im ?"
16293,i read somethinga bout him . waws made to help a kid who didn't like the idea 9f hdaring aids
16294,did you kow marvelg o tto play a lower rate on toys because they said mutants aen't people ?
16295,i did not kniow that ! arr you a comics fan ? did you know that black panther is one of the top grossing movies ever ?
16296,i heard that it was ! have you seen it ? i haven't even watched it yet .
16297,"i have not . i have seen a couple of the comic movies , this one se trecords for having ah uge opening by a black director ."
16298,"the black anthe ris supposedly worth 500 billio n. that's more thna zpple , i think !"
16299,i wonder where he got his money ? i dic redad that his name balck panther has nohinhg to do with the black panthers from the '60s .
16300,"i saw that it is from something calld nisibdi , which goes bwck to the 4th century in nigeria . it's more likely the party was named after him ."
16301,did you kno wthat marvel comics sild the screen rights of itsc haracters for 25 million to sony ? sony turned thme down and orfered 10 million only fors piderman ? they thoughtt hat was the only character people would b einte5ested in .
16302,do you think it's because sony only wanted to create video games from the movies ? i have to admit that i like the spider man movies the most . the whol eai situation with ironman i fijnd a littlec reepy .
16303,i did enjoy spiderman but some of the avrngers are getting difficilt to keep up with ! i can't believe that disney owns the rights to produce the movi4es but cant' use it in there paroks . i know universa ltheme park has the spiderman ride .
16304,"wow ! i didn't kn9ow universal had a spiderman r9de . i knew that disney 0owned the star wars franchise , now , gut marvel ."
16305,"on another note , did you know that tom hanks is the highest all time box office star ?"
16306,i think i heard that h ewas . what movie did he make the mos tmone7 on ?
16307,"o am not sure , but io would gues it was the ction one about the vatican scandal . can you believe tha5 silence of the lamb came ut on valentines day ?"
16308,no . i didn't remember when hte movie came out . i know that i was in dollege becausw i wanted to be a prosecutor until i saw tht movie .
16309,yikes ! disney's biggesr flop was treasue planet . i have never heard of it !
16310,"i have heard of it , bu ti always get it confused with the nuppets treasure island ."
16311,haha ! i do remember h3aring that denzel washingtonh ad suppirted an actor through colelge . i read that it was chadwick bseman who got to thank him as the lback panther premiere .
16312,"that was super nice of denzel washington . of course to denzle , that money was probably pocke change . now , chadwick boseman will have enough money to support someone else after playing the black panther ."
16313,i like the truly kindness in people . did you know that the wuperuero creators made blue ear to make a boy fesl better about wearign hearing aids ?
16314,"no , i didn't , but i love that idea ! hope you hav ea goocd night !"
16315,hi . do you like science fiction
16316,"i do enjoy science fivtion quite a bit , as well as al sorts of fiction . it certainly says something that lord of the ringd won the only acaem award for best pictyre for a fantasy fil, ."
16317,"by the way , do yo0uw ant to be a scientist"
16318,"no , i think that sc8ence is interesting but not something i want to studyw ith my life's energy . i do find it shocking toh ear that we have reached the point of storing gif imkwges onto the dna o bacteria !"
16319,"did you know that aihito , the emperor of japan is a scientust"
16320,"no , that's amazing 1q i love to learn about people in various roles who aee secretly scientists , such as matt patricia who is a coac hfor the nfl but also a rocket scientist ."
16321,he does not look like a scientist to me
16322,rhe coac h0r the japanese emperor ? i think it's imortanr to note that being a scientistd oes not automatically make someone ' bright . '
16323,i concur . being knowlegable in one thing doez not guarantee in the others
16324,"exactly , although it does seem like older scientists such aa william whewell from 1833 , were more fancy and legitimate thna some of the people today ."
16325,did you knjow harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon
16326,"no , i had never heard of him only the classics like armstrong anda ldrin ! it's no wonder though since the scientists are thd omes who do all of the hard work . in vact much of our culture aznd modern knowledge stems from 5he early form of science which was called natura lphilosophy ."
16327,i thought that there should be a lot more oft hem walking on the moon already
16328,"i guess it get sfcomplicated when sciecne is so wrapped up in every industry such asg overnment , academie , nonprofits and most importantly the economy . they must not be able to afford it ."
16329,i was surprised that the world wide web was invented in 19i89 . i thoght it was way befor ethat
16330,it is a bit nerve inducing though wehn you think about the plots o fshows like ' black mirror '
16331,i have never watched that show . what was it about
16332,it is an anthology series that features various horror plots baoiut the modern technology and other things like thst .
16333,"ohh , is ee . i am going to watch it if i have time"
16334,"i haven' twatched it much though yet , i find all of this technol so creepy especiaplly the storing dat ain dna bit !"

16339,i do ! they are some of my favorites how about you ?
16340,"i love them , black panther was one of my favorite s. so much awesomeness in that film , did you like it ?"
16341,"i loved it ! i didn't realize though that the caracter wasn't actually named afte rthe black panther party . i always thougth it mihht be conected , but apparently the super hero predates the party ."
16342,"me too , i did not know that either , it would make sene because of the black pqrt . he is also the richest superhero at 500 billion dollars"
16343,i read that too ! that's crazy . did you know disney doesn't own any rgbhts to use bigm arvel characters eas tof the mississippi ? i've always wondered why they never had any marvel things at disneyalnd i guess thats why !
16344,"that is interesting ! i did not knowt uhag , i hae only been to florida . who is your favorite marvel character ?"
16345,"spiderman for sure ! did you know thats ony got offered the rightsr o all marvel characters in 1998 , but rejected it and purchased spiderman 9nly because they didn't think people would care about the others ?"
16346,"nice ik love me som3e spiderman ! i ehard stan lee created iron man ebcause he didn't think anyone would like htem . speaking of disney before , did you hear about their biggest box office flop ?"
16347,"really ? its hard to imagine anyone not likinb iron man . and no , i didn't hear what was it ?"
16348,"it was treasur eplanet , they spent 15000000 on it and made only 309 dollars ! i can't believet ha tt6o be true !"
16349,oh my gosh i've never even hear dof that ! 309 is nothing !
16350,right ! i wan tto watch it to see how bad it really was ? i wonder if they pulled it out of embarrassment and maby peopole being fired
16351,for real ! i want to see it too ! did ylu know sleeping beauty was a box office failure too ?
16352,"i did not know tha t, i did hear one movie maded isney almost shut down thei ranimation studios , must have been that"
16353,yeah that was it ! crazy to think disney animation could have ended that soon so many good movies would never hazve been made !
16354,"for sure , i love frozen and moana . frozen waw teh first movie directed by a woman for disney"
16355,i love boht of those too ! i didn't know frozen waa direxterd by a female really cool ! was moana as well ?

16358,bye !
16359,"hi , how are you ?"
16360,"pretty good thanks for asking , ypu ?"

16362,yeah ih eard he still to this day publisehs papers
16363,"sometimes i wonder wha tthese scientists are getting up to . harvzrd scientists stored a gif animation of ag alloping horse in the dna of bacteria . um , what abouyt a cure for cancer ?"
16364,no money in that ! ! i feel the same way . the term scientist didnt even becoem of regular use until teh 19th century .
16365,"teh web was invented pretty recetnly , in 1989 , by a dcientist working in switzerland for the cern . tim berners lee . the guy is a legend l but probably brought human productivity iin the work place to a standstill ."
16366,ow i did not know thar . however was it funded by a europeanstate ?
16367,"yeah , cern is in ejrope . it's a big research facility . did you know that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comicb ecause it featured a black character ? i can't imagine that happening in eureope ."
16368,yeah unfortunately some ppl are mean and hateful . did you know that fantasy congress is a real thing
16369,"people will wager on anything . it's goo dto take na intrest in politics but i don't think those people that do fatasy congress card about realworld implications , just whether they win ."
16370,yeha your rigth ! julius daesarw rote fantasy .
16371,"he had an active imagination , which probabpy helped him s a general ."
16372,probably ! did you know tha tedgara lleh poe wrote the first known examle of what we wlu8ld call a cyborg .
16373,the guy was certaijnly macabr e. great imagination . but married a 13 yo if i recall correctly .
16374,yeah he wws celarly interesting
16375,but left an entertqinong legacy for us ! i agree with george rr martin about fan fiction . t'd usually awful .
16376,harrkison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon
16377,i ghess you need to be in great shape to go to the moon . skon there will be commercial travel to them oon and every old lady with a dog will be tgoing .
16378,funny ! but if old newt gingrich gets hes w3ay will ave a colony there soon .
16379,"well , i enjoyed chatting !"
16380,did you know rhat there is a fantasy draft for the national spell8ng bee ?
16381,taht is crazy ! i wonder how t wokrs ?
16382,"me too . you know there was a janitor in chicago that wrote 15 , 145 pages over 6 years . wow !"
16383,that is crazy . it is unfortunate that is was discovered after his death . it would have been nice if he was alive .
16384,yes one can hope right ! it qas a fantasy januscriptw ith over 300 watercolor illustrations . do you remembe rwhat it was called ?
16385,it was called ' in the realms of the unreal ' . creative name .
16386,yeah real catchy tilte right . makes me want to opoen it up . appqrently therew as a guy that got knighted for his service to literature . you know him ?
16387,was it the comedic fantasy author terry pratchett ?
16388,it was good fo5 him i wonder what it's like to be knighted ? did you know a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving relaity and fantasy ?
16389,that is crazy ! i would think it would be more thna just a fold !
16390,"yeah me too , lets us know how close we are to insanify . lol ! do you like fiction ?"
16391,some fiction . have yu ever use dwiki to see the ranks for ictional characters ?
16392,i did not know they even did that i'll have to check it out . whaf do they rank them by i wonder .
16393,they rank according to their powers and abilities .
16394,"oh ok that amkes sense , lol . di dyou know that caesar wrote fan fiction ?"
16395,he wrktef an fict6ion about hercules and oedipuws in his youth !
16396,yeah that sounds cool . you know edgar alloen poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction ?
16397,i did not know that ! the ravens football team is after his works .
16398,to funny ! fictiln refers o any narreative that is erived from the imagination .
16399,"further , it is not based strictly on history or fact ."
16400,and can also refer more narrowly to narratives written only in prose .
16401,i mighr go to the library and find some fiction boks . have a nice day .
16402,i thought the black panther movie was generic nad not that good
16403,i respec6t that opinion . i personally thought the movie was very well made and introduced many intereztin gcharacters . earning 23 5million at the box office is quite a feat .
16404,"that is impressive , i th9nk this whol ething about the strong feminist characters is very ovebrlo2n , i thought females portraydd in movies like terminator 2 and aliesn are more realistic , they are women that are bad ass but in a realisti way"
16405,i did enjoy both terminator 2 and yhe alines movies . i think that we need to have women who are bad ass in all areas . addin gin a general and spy to those ranks is good for women . what did you think of the idea of having an all female protection squaqdl ike the dora milaje ?
16406,"ya i mean that is fine . it says in this artilce tjat their sex appeal is obvious but secodnary to their personality an ksill . they didn't have a personality in my opinion , i guess they hads kill but i find it very unrealistic that they zrr killing people who have guns with like swords and spears"
16407,i think that requires a suspension of belief which it sounds like didn't quite cross the gap for you . the cmics go much more into detail of hwy wakanda's weapons are swords and spears as you put it but that is quite a bit for a movie to explain untilr ipley's weapkns in the aliensm ovioes or terminato rweapons . even though i di denjoy the mov ei didn't think it was jofre than a weekend activity .
16408,"well i apprciate your honestly and i?m not judging you for your opinion , i'm reading through and it says that black panther is actually ther ichest marvel superhero , even moret han tony atark , which i didn't know"
16409,"that i strue , although to be frank that's like comparing spiderman , tony stark , to batman , lback panther , which is not really fair . tiny developed alkl his own technologya nd black pantherh ad a lot of he;lp dn inherited his wealth though his country . i did lik ethat dorothy steel 2wasa ble to make her acting debut as the old woman in black panther . sometimes 0eople get a dream late ."
16410,"ya that is nice , and he would be ricehr than even tom hank's entire box office draw at 8 . 5 million , whch is a ton , also that is so weird that silence of the lambs came out on valentines day"
16411,"what a creepy valnetine's day debut ! yeah , tony stark is my favorite avenger zs i like seeing how fa rhis character has come to far . i hope he mentor sblack panther anr the rest of the avengers but that avengers : endgame doesn't look like he wiol get the cahnce . i wonder if marvel will ever show the blue eqr supe4hsro in the avengers ."
16412,"ah i haven't heard of the bluee ar , i do think its funny that marfel tried to xell sony all their properties in 98 but theyr efused , nad now marvel is making so much mobey as sony's superhero movies are pretty terrible , in my opinion"
16413,"yrah , blue ear was a character created for a 4year old child who was unbcomfortable wearing hearing aids . i did not know marvel tried to zell tos ony . that's so funmy when you think about if now . did you know mixhael jackson tried to buy marvel comics in the 1990s ?"
16414,"nope i ddn't know that either , i wonder how much hr offered , i knlw they wwre in bad shape for some part pf the 90's , it's hood that they're back on track now"
16415,"yeah , it is good they are back on track . if we look back though you can find may moies in the past did very well . loo at the originals tar wars movies which if we adjusted for inflation would have made 1 . 3 billion at the box office ."
16416,"ya that is crazy , ijt's also wild that walt disney owns marvel and the star wars mocies , they really have exploded and its funny theu were thinking about closing theird oors when sleeping beauty wasw a boz office failure"
16417,it is wild that watl diseny has acqireda ll these properties . not only sleeping beauty was a box office failure but other movies like john cartera nd children of men whi9ch when we look back in time both were considered failure but children of men lost 8 million at the box office .
16418,"o wow i didn't know children of men only made that much , i actually like that movie a lot , i did remember disney's treasure plane mvie , that was a huge bomb , i saw it rexenlty its ok but i can zee why it wasn't successful"
16419,"yeah , t's sad that cbildren of men lost that much money but ironic that mortal kombat 2 was the first video game to make more than hollywood box offive sales before call of duty . however there are more lodsse swhich were actually wins as well like lord of the rings which had major losses despite bring a huge box offive success ."
16420,"ya that iss urprising , have you seen the movie troja nwars ? budget of 15 kmillion and made only 309 ? htats hilarious i?'m gonna look it up now"
16421,i have not seen trojan wars but i will check it outs ometime . tyanks for chat and remember you cab't loss more money yhan marve; or the fantastic four movies .
16422,haha thank snice talojngw ith you
16423,have you seen black panther film ?
16424,"i did . i saw it was just no,inated for several oscars including best pictu4e . did you know that he is the richest superhero ?"
16425,yes . i know a little bt . i think 'b;ack panther' stars share rea.llife inspirations .
16426,"i was not aware of that . taht makes for nice relationships on set . lback panther the character is estimated to be wortgh 500 billion . to compare , tony stark has 100 billion ."
16427,do you like chadwick boseman ?
16428,black panther is the only movie i've eger seen him in . he did a good job in that movie .
16429,he i sknow nfor his ;ortrayao of t'chaloa .
16430,yes fhat is the only role i've ever sene him in . daanir gurira was in it and i had deen hr in the 3alking dead so she was the one i was most familiar with .
16431,have 7ou know the details of box office ?
16432,i know some facts about box lffice returns . like tom hanks ist he highest box office star .
16433,"yes , he is an american actor and filmmnaker . hanks is known for his comedic and dramatic roles in such films as splash , big , turner and hooch"
16434,yes he has had lots of yits . later he had movies like saving private ryan whihc is amazing . did you know that sleeping beauty was a box office failure ? that surprises me but it's not always the best indicatio nf success because i know several bombs that became hits later .
16435,"i think , wlt saw the potential to sell guests a this groundrbeakin gtheme park on his upcoming film and renqmed it sleeping heauty cstle before its grand opening ."
16436,he certainly made a good business decision tehre . i can'y believe that they opned the silence of the lambs on valentine's day ! it wprked out for them though because they amde 270 in box ofice returns .
16437,"yes , disney also has some of the biggest box office fllps of all time ."
16438,"that's very surprising to me . they seem to be doing just fine though . speak9ng of since didsney just acquired marvel , do you enjoy marvel ?"
16439,"yes , i like it . marvel comucs group , a publisher of aemrican comic books and related media ."
16440,i like a lot of their propertiez and movies . i did not now that there is a character naemd access that is owned by both marvel and dc . rhey afe such strong competitors that it s7rprisesm e .
16441,me alsl like theirm 0fies . that's in6eresting .
16442,but marvel is a savvy business so i'm sure it benefited them somehow . did you know that they had to pay less for their toys because dol;s are more expensive and they won an argument in court by saying that xmdn are mutants and not people so they can't be dolls ?
16443,sorry i do not know about this . do you know htat details ?
16444,basically they argued in court tha txmen characters were mutants and not people so they paid less to distribute the t9ys because they were then classified a stoys instead of dolls and dolls cost more .
16445,did you happen to see the black panther movi e?
16446,"yes , i rentedt he movie from my cable company ."
16447,"i did not see it yet , but i want to evnetually ."
16448,you definitely shoul d! it didv ery well and was well receivsd by most people .
16449,"i heard it had the 5th biggest openihg ever , that is very impressive ."
16450,i gre . i love the avengers series . i try to see as many of them as i can .d o you enjoy them as well ?
16451,i haven't seen any of the avengers movies actually . i did read that avengers ; ahe o fultron had a huge box office total as well .
16452,"yds , but i'm not sure of the future of th eseries since disney boight the company ."
16453,i heard that as well . are you a marvel comics fan in gen4eral ?
16454,i would consider myself one yes . especially since i rea dthey made a super hero with a hearing aid just becauwe a boy was uncomfvortable wifth how own .
16455,i used to like reading 5tuhe comics when i was younger . 9i hsard that in 1998 marvel olffered allt he movie rights to almos tall the characters to sony and they rekected .
16456,"well that is goo news for disney ! they are doing well it seems , s8nce star wars out eanred prequel.s by 1 . 3 billion . ib et disney will do well with these upcoming movies ."
16457,"yeah i think buying the star wars rights was a brillianf move , taht shoul dpay off for years to come ."
16458,it is hard to believeb lack panther maqde 192 million dollars n just one weekend htough . very impressive for a movi ethey were unsure would b epopular .
16459,"yeah i afree , and i think they will make a bunch more black panther movies and otheres similar ."
16460,"it's hard tio say if they will do as well , though . i think a lot of hte success has to be because of coogler . creed was also a great movie that did very well ."
16461,"yeah i agree again , coogler was a huge part oft he success it ahs seen ."
16462,can't really give all tue credit to one person th9ugh . the main actor micahel jordan was a great choice for the role .
16463,yeah i think he is a reall good actor . i enjoyed creed much more than i was naticipating .
16464,do you go to the box office to buy your tickets or do you usually buy thm online or zome other souhrce ?
16465,"i usually buhy them online , so i can pick my seat and know that i have a tickwt ."
16466,"my local theaters are usually not very busy , so i just buy them at the box office ."
16467,i can understand that tehn . it was nice chatting with you toda6 .
16468,i was nice chattin gwith you as well . take cade .
16469,"yep , have a good night ."
16470,you too !
16471,hi ! are you a fan of superh3roes ?
16472,i dont reslly follow comics and superheroes much . you ?
16473,not much really . lol i've been reading about them htis morning . therea re over 300 registe5ed superheroes in the united states .
16474,how does one register a superhero ? 8i would like to have my own sulerhero .
16475,i have no idea ! i think you can register anything that you create . there was a garfield book eries spinoff named pt force which featured garfiels and his gang as superheroes . lol
16476,that lrobably was funnier than thew regular garfield . why was that comic even started ? i never liked it .
16477,lol i have no idea . there was a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes .
16478,what a job . cleanimg up0 the mess of heroes . a thankless jo b. i wonder how much it paid .
16479,"probably not5 much . marvel comics creator stan lee wrote 15 dc comics , reimagining popular superheroes like batman and spiderman . they were squeezing all the cash they coul dout of them even back in the day . lol"
16480,i wonder why stan was workinh for d c. i guess they paid him a ton .
16481,probably . what do you do when you r7n out of new ideas fof superheroes ?
16482,"um , i guess you jhire a team of monkeys l, stick them in front of typewriters , and havet hem work for a hundred years ?"
16483,lol close . . . you create a ne wsuperhero called ' normalman ' and you make him the only person without superpowers on a planst full of superheroes ! lol
16484,"opposite world ? that sounds like a weird place . nor,alman is anything but normal on that planet ."
16485,lol disney does not own the rights to show big marvel charactws in htek3e parks east of the miss9ssippi due to a cotnract marvel signed with universal studios in the 90s . interesting .
16486,"disney seems tp be buying moee and more . they have marvel , star wars . i nthue future , it will all be disney ."
16487,you're not kidding there . marvel comics created a superhero called blue ear just for a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing hearoij aids which he needrd . the boyt old his mom tha superheroews don' twer hearig aids so amrvel then created the character .
16488,that is really cool of marvel . i bet the kid was stoked to see that
16489,i bet he was . good to see a feel good story like 5ht . it's bren fin chatting with you ! i learned a lot about superheroes and comics ! lol
16490,"yes , i enjoyedc hatting too ! have a good day !"
16491,you have a goo dday as well !
16492,"hello there , are you a comi cbook fvan ?"
16493,"i'm not very into reading them , but i'm a sucker for any marvel or dc domic movie !"
16494,"i javent' seen to many of the films , but i used to read yhe comics and watch xmen a lot ."
16495,ah . so 6ou didn't see blank panther ? it wa sawesome .
16496,no i didn't see that one but hear it was rwlly good .
16497,"yeah , i didn't know black panther is technically the ricues superhero . tony stakr is second , but way far off than bp ."
16498,"that is crazy , i never knew there was one that had more mon3y than thoset wo ."
16499,"yeah , apparently black panther is estimatecd to be worth around 500 billion , while tojy stark is only 100 milliion . bruce waybe networth is8 0 billion . i guess itm akes sense , balck pan5her is like , the king of a whole country ."
16500,"i will have to see the movie , it will most likely make more sense then ."
16501,"it's basically about a king who beczme king when his father dies , then anoher guy challenge the legitimacy o fhis sovereignty and hey duke it out ."
16502,"that is interesting , i head they used historical symbols in the movie as well ."
16503,"yeah , some symbols from as early as the 4th century ."
16504,"wow , that is vgery cool , i love itw hent hey use historical stuff in movies ."
16505,"pparently , the name for black panther predates the pkltical grou . that's weird ."
16506,"that is weird , i thinj they briefly chanvged the name to avoid being confused with the party ."
16507,"ydeah , ik can see how that wuld be al ittle controversial . they also had an issue with an indian translation because one of the character's sayings becaus eit was a villain praising a hindu go d."
16508,"that is true , i think they made changes as to not offend anyone and it backfired ?"
16509,"d8id you know the cr5eator of marvel , stan lee , envisioned several dc comics characters ? that would e neat to see ."
16510,"no i didn't , yeaht hat would be very cool to see what he had u his sleeve ."
16511,"yeah , i aonder what batman or superman would be in a marvelstyle world . way more clorful and humorous !"
16512,"right , well we can wonder . it's been good talking with you today , i hope you havfe a good one !"
16513,did you watch the black panther movie ?
16514,"i did , i saw it in theaters last yea rand oved it . did you ?"
16515,"i loved it as well , chadwick boseman is a great avtor , i lovefh is role on the movie"
16516,"yea he was great as tvhala , but michael b jordan was evwn better . his performance a killmonger was amazing"
16517,"i agree , bhos role in the movie was great , you know that ij the comics he is the richest superhero"
16518,"i don't droubt it , he is a dipl,omat from a raw material rixh nation . though i'm kind of surprised he jhas more thanh tony stark"
16519,yeah more than starj and batman combined 2 times
16520,wow ; did you know wony actually turned down al;l of thes efilm rights back in the day when they only cost a measily 25 million ? they only wanted spideu
16521,"i bet they are regretting that decision now since each hro is worth like a hundred times more that value , spiderman is my favorite hero though"
16522,"he's definitely up there for me . back then though i bet no one had any idea lal of theseh eroes would be so huge . really only xmen , fantastic 4 , adn spiderman were thew ell known marvel properties , which were alls natched up"
16523,do you have a favorite marvel hero ? mine is ony starfk he is a badass
16524,"i like a lot of them but my favorites mightb e spiderman or wolverine . everyone is pretty awesome though . i wis hhugh jackman wasn't done with ther ole , he wa sperfect for it"
16525,"i agree and it woulx be nce to watch a deadpool vs wolverine movie , it would be awesome ! like one of te highest box office m0ovies of all time"
16526,"seriously , with how popular deadoool isa nd how much publicity their ' feud ' is getting laely . maybe this is all some sort of grand marketing scheme ?"
16527,"it could be , there are a lot of hints in the deadpool movi eabout a merge including both"
16528,that would he awsome to see . did you know stan lee has actyally written 15 comis for dc ? he's not just a marvel guy
16529,"that's amazing , i have to read thosee , there'e is a hero called blue ear , the story behind his creation ia an interesting on"
16530,"is it ? i've never heard od him before , tell me about it"
16531,"ok so blu eear is a hero created fo ra 4 year old boy who felt insecure about his hearing aid devices , so marvel vreated the hero to help him and his mom"
16532,oh that's so nice of them ! making all kids feel like they can be w hero too
16533,"i know right , helping a kid like that , an admirable thing to do , i wish more c0mpanies followed that example , robert downey rj also cheers upc hildren with special conditions ."
16534,hi how are you ?
16535,i'm gteat thanms . did you see the movie black panther ?
16536,i did bit i fell asleep through most od it . id you ?
16537,i have not seen it yet . the richest superhero is black panther . did you know that ?
16538,i did ! he has an estimated 500 billion dollars !
16539,that's crazy ! the symbols in black panther are based on an actual script called nibdi .
16540,nsibdi dated back to the 4th century and is indigenous to present day nigeria !
16541,that's pretty old then . black panmther was actually not named after the black pantehr party .
16542,makes sense ! he is worth more than tony staro and bruce wayne combined !
16543,that's insane . do you like marvel ?
16544,8 do ! did you know disney does not ownt he rights to show big marvel characters int hmee park seast of the mississippi ?
16545,i did not know that . that's eally interesting .
16546,it was due to a contract marvel sigend with universal in the 90s .
16547,interesting . there is one character owned by both marvel adn dc eho's name is access .
16548,i heard his only purpose is to try and keep; vboth compaies universes separate .
16549,that's odd . did you kmnow there was a comics eries about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes ?
16550,"i did not . probab,y a good idea since they cause so much damage ."
16551,i agree . there are over 300 registered superheroes in hte united states .
16552,that is so many . mh uncle actually was ffriebds with stan lee who wrote 15 dc comics .
16553,that's ptetty awesome ! i can't believe he passed away recently . he lived a long life thoug h. filled wit hlots of fun and adventure .
16554,yesh e definitel6 lived a good life .
16555,wel it was great chatting with you . tell your uncle sorry for his loss .
16556,did you wagch black pantbher ?
16557,"not yet ,b ut i have heard good things about it and am looking forward to seeing it . you ?"
16558,"i watched it and really liked it , the leading actor really sole the rol3 of t'challa"
16559,black pnathr is suppoed to be the richest superhero . does it show in the movie ?
16560,"it does , he is basically the king of wakanda , theres a lot of cool tech in the movioe"
16561,"so , is it like batman , or what ? black panther has 500 billion vs 80 billion for gruce wayne , so he could afford somw pretty nide tech gaegets !"
16562,"yeah kind of , only richer than hik nd stark together"
16563,"nice . so , i heard forest whitaker is in this movie . i enjoy hi sperformance sin other movies . what is his role in this ?"
16564,"im not sure , he is part of th cast but i cany recall who he is , th ecast is great though"
16565,"so , i hear chadwick bosema nis great i nthis . thwre is a great backstory to chadwick having some of his educatio funded by denzel washington , an dthe movie premiere brought them together so he could thank denzel . neat , huh ?"
16566,"i hewrr about that , i think denzel has a great heart , chadwick thanked him over the premiere of the movie"
16567,"denzel ha ssome awesome inspirational speeches on youtube that you would probablye njoy seeing . i know i did . so , in the movie , was there reference to the nigerian nsibdi script that the story features ?"
16568,"i didnt knw that , but that is really cool sound slike the directors , scripts writer did a great job reesearching , so are you a fan of marvel comics ?"
16569,"in general , yes , although i ma behind in my watch8ing of movioes . . . sounds like you are , am i right ?"
16570,"i am , big fan so i watch them ws they come out , in 2009 disney bougbht yhe tranchise"
16571,"i thought disney didn't have the rigths to the characters . is this true ? fantastic fojr was my favorifte growing up , along with spiderman . . . how about you ?"
16572,"i liked ironm na and also liked batman , but his from dc comics , you know tehy actually osn a character together"
16573,"yeah . it sounds weird , but i guess it somehow helps them to ekep their universes separate . i wonder how it works ?"
16574,i guess that character is not necessary but it works for tgem .
16575,did you know that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the us ? i wonder if ' normalman ' is one of them ?
16576,"i didn't know that , and he must be , normalmba teh hero without any powers ."
16577,did you hear that the richest superhero is actually the black panther at 500 billion ?
16578,"i didn't . that's amazing , 500 miloion dolslrs is a lot for a superhdro to hav e. i learned a lot about black panther"
16579,"in 1989 xonyw as offered cinematic rights to almost all of the marvel characters for only7 25 milkon and they rejected only purchasing spiderman rights for 10 mi,lion"
16580,"wow ! i learned that michael jackson trie dto buy marvel comifs in the early 1990's , so that he could play spjdermazn . spiderman is definitely a popular superhe4ro ."
16581,that's interesting . the symbols and written script in bpack panther are based on acual script called nsibdi from the 4h5 century
16582,ot is truly interest8ng how many details go into the marvel universe . black panther was the 1t8h film i nthe marvel cinematic unvers and there are t least 30 superhero movies set to be released between 20162020 .
16583,yes it is . did you hear that black panther wasn't named after the black panther party and iyts name was black leopard for some time
16584,"i didn't ! i acthally haven'ts een hlack panther , but i want to after learning more . the actor that played black panther actually went to school with money from denzel washington !"
16585,marvel d8id some censoring of the utterance ' praise hanuman ' due to possible backlash .
16586,"i'm not sure what that is referring to , bu ti'll ;ook int9 it . the actor that plays thev illain's father , n'jobu is from the hitt eelvision showt his is us . he happebs to b emy favorite character , which maeks me want to watch it more ."
16587,marvel was able to successfully argue that mutants aren't people to get to pay lower raes on xmen toys thand olls necaus ethey are not human
16588,that' bizarre ! marvel also published a genericc omic book to trademark the names ' superhero ' and ' supervillain . ' strange injdeed .
16589,"surprisingly , disney doesn't own rights to show ' ig ' marvel character sin them parks east ov 6he mississippi hecause of a cont4act with universal in the 90's ."
16590,interesting ! the walt disney company didn't even buy marvel until w009 .
16591,there was a comic series concerning fixign collaterla damage caused byes uperheroes
16592,"that's always bothered me about the avengers movies . tjey cause major destruction . thanos mad his debut in the avengers ' infinity war ' that came out on may 4 , 2018 ."
16593,don't you hate tat the bad guy almost always dies att he end of the superhero mivies ' they are so predic6able .
16594,"they really are ! according to what i learned though , somke of thbe villain or superhero interactione in black panther are different thn in other mavel movies ."
16595,ho war ethey different ?
16596,"michael b . jortdan creates a more dtnmai c, creative villain than seen before . he has even been compated to heath ledger's joker , which in my opinion , is thweg reatest superhero villain ."
16597,one character is owned by both marvel anf dc named access an dhis purpose is to keep both companieds' universes separate . i don't know how that works though .
16598,me either ! good cahtting with you . tahnks for hte ne3w inforjation . i am going to see if blawck panther is still on netflix to watch toniht .
16599,sounds good ! there are over 300 registeed supereheroes so it sounds like wec na watch a lot .
16600,"hi , did you evrr watch the black panther ?"
16601,"no ,b ut i heardd it was goodb ut i'm not really into th esuperh4ro thing in gneeral ."
16602,it is reaklly good . and the character is actually the wealthiest of them all
16603,i heard jill scott tweeted that it bedat star wars .
16604,i think so too .t he symbols used in the movie date back to 4th century
16605,interesting . i heard it invigorated the sjperhero genre as well a sreigning over other movies like teh avengers .
16606,yeah that is for sure . did you know chadwick boseman was accepted into a prestigious summer theatre camp at oxford but could not afford to go ?
16607,"until now , i've never heard the name . i do know that it hasn othing to do wiht tbe black panther party ."
16608,yeah he managed to go anyways from a private sponsor who turned out to be denzel washington
16609,i had no idea that comic bookl characters would be worth so much . the rightas tro spiderman wwnt for 10m
16610,i cannot believe sonyd id not but more superhero rights but just spidemran
16611,"yeah , it's not like they don't havet he bucks . i thought supefheroes went bavck further than the 1930s . i suppose they do if you've everr esd homer ."
16612,yah i am sure tehy do . do you know who is the charater access ?
16613,no before now . i alsod idn't know there was one called ' normalman ' a guyt hat has no superpowers . i guess i'm a ' normalman . '
16614,yeah that is strange . access actually does not have powers just keep marvel and dc universes separate
16615,"ih adn't heard of ' blue ear , ' a superh4ro mnarvel createdf or a 4 yer old boy that didn't like wearing his hearing aid . that was nice . . ."
16616,ha was super nice for sure . did you know marvel successfully argued that mutants are nt people in court ?
16617,"that's trange . . . poor bruce wayne . . . hes' only wort h80b and tony stark,'s wor4th 190b ."
16618,and not to think of all the collatral damage that superheroes cause
16619,"yeah , i wonder who carries tehir liability isurance . maybe the boack panther who's worth 500b ?"
16620,hahha i ebt . nice hcaqt .
16621,hello ! did you now there's a superhero called ' normalman ' ?
16622,"yes , mostly of kids and hcildren are like superhero now days adult and aged people also love this character ."
16623,i guess superhero is a gfeqat busin4ss ! a lot of people are waiting for the next superhero movie .
16624,the main aim of the shperhero to protect the psople from thee vil and save from the distracter .
16625,one of the biggest companies to make money out of superheroes is mwrvel . thy even makie money out of toys ! !
16626,"the ar epublish the comics books for kids . the walt disney co,pany acquired marvel entertainmnet . it make the chislren to good and they support to live teh self discipline ."
16627,that makes disney a monster company ! they own most of the mark4t !
16628,",ichael jackson tried tiob uy marvel comics in the early 1990's but it not happened for some reason . otherwise he became the hero of spiderman movie ."
16629,michael jackson made some great deals ! he bought the rights of all the music from the ebatles . and that'a lot money ! !
16630,sure ! the word superhero is commonly used for women also . there are some women superheros .
16631,yes . superhero movie swould eb dea dwithout women superheros !
16632,back panther brings life to marvel ' s greatest superhero . jordan' sunforgettable performance as 5the classic villan .
16633,seems like he did a gokod job portraying the villain ! sometimes villains are fhe best in a movie !
16634,"vil,ains charavcter designed very differently so only people like superhero very much ."
16635,"sadly superheros are not as good a sthey seem . most of them can not control thir rage , are violent , and kill as much people as the villais !"
16636,sure . marvel published comic book in the superhero . it attract the children abd also all aged people especially in sinve 1930s .
16637,"as we were talking before , it's a great business ! the publish only wha tthey know people a5re going to like !"
16638,"it develop reading habit among the children . it is biggest change over in the world . mostly reading comics books uis nice .,"
16639,"im surprised that marvel could win a case in court saying their characters aren ot h8mans , and then to have their taxed reduced !"
16640,i thibk it i svery funny thing .
16641,"it was very nicet alkingt o you , have a great day !"
16642,trhank yo . wish yoh the same .
16643,great ray ! !
16644,who is your favourite dperhero ?
16645,spid
16646,hi have you seen the black panter movie ?
16647,"yeah ! i realy like michael b . jordan as the villain erik kill,monger !"
16648,nice ! did you know that the richestg superhero is actually black panter ? he has an estimated 500 billion dpllars !
16649,holy co w. marvl has s9 much money ! they have created so many superheroes !
16650,yes ! tony stark is worth 100 billion and bruce wayne is worth 80 billion as well !
16651,amazing . the marvel brand began all he way back in 1961 .
16652,wow . i didn't know that . there is one character owned by both marvel and dc named access . never heard of them .
16653,i wonder if he will be in a movie soon . michael jackson saw the impkortance and tried to buy marvel in the 90's !
16654,wow . i didn't kno athat . he probably would haged one some amazing things with the brand i would think .
16655,yeah agreed . he wanted to buy it so he vcould ply spiderman that would haveb een interesting kol .
16656,neat ! i never knew that . did you kno wthat there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states ?
16657,wish they were better at their job lol ! i am grateful for stan le ecrea6ing all the characters in his hniverse !
16658,yes ! he created a nice industry for people to get involved with and be entertaine d. did you ever read comic books ?
16659,as a child sometimes . marvwl once published a generic comicbook . . . that woud be interesting to see .
16660,"that would be ! there was a co,ic serirs about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes ! lol"
16661,o i always wondered about all the damage they caused . sir iswac newton was once a sorcerer supreme in the marvel universe !
16662,i ndver knew that ! did you know that there is a superhero claled normalman ? he wzs the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes !
16663,hahat hat would not be a fun movie to see ! ther ewas once something cllsd pet force which featured garfield as a superhero !
16664,nice ! i never knew that . i loved garfield . stan lee wrote 15 dc cimics reimaining popular superheroes like batman and superman . i didn't kno that .
16665,"he was such a visionary . there is actually a book called becoming batman , written by a neuroscentist ."
16666,ye she was ! sad he died this past year . it's eben a pleasure chatring with you !
16667,did you see ' black panther ' ?
16668,"no , was it a good movie ? i read it stars mihcael b . jordan as ' black panther ' and erik killmonger"
16669,"he was great as a villain ,s ome says he was the best ."
16670,it eems like vllains have done s better job recently after the creation of avengers : uinfinity wars
16671,they did modify his story to give him morfe depth .
16672,thanos will most likely make his mark making nearly every mcu movie ehro try to stop hi .
16673,"yeah , but in the case of killmonger , his humanity come ffomk his link with hs father . n'jobu ."
16674,"i have toc orrect myself that jordan actually stars as the villain killmonger , not black pqanther . i appreciate the fact that they are making supehreroe smore diverse zs well with black panther ebing the greatest lback superhero from marvel"
16675,and killmonger being the best villain in the cu makes it more diverse .
16676,n'jobu played a great rol even though it was limited tl flashbacks ad dream sequences eh had a huge emotional impact on the movie .
16677,"by undersanding his point of view his radicalization , it make killmobger more complexz and more interesting ."
16678,the vijllain must always fall inh mcu but killmonger will be remembered !
16679,do you thanos will achieve yhte same success as a villain ?
16680,"i'm not sure he'll have the same passion , but hew ill be a contenderw irh all his strength being that all the superheroes will have to unite to figh thim"
16681,to think that marvel offered the ights of all its superheroes o for sony for only 25 miloion they could have lost a lot of mone if they accepted .
16682,that is probably true . marvwl has a soft spot though . they created superhero hearing aids that were a ' blue ear ' for a 4 year old who was ucnomfortgable wearing them .
16683,"that is cute , but who has rights to sell what with the marvels heroe sis very complicated , like disne7 that can't show any marve lchaacters in its theme parks because universal has bouhg tthem ."
16684,michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics because he watned to plays piderman in his 9wn produced movie . i wonder how hta twould have3 gone ?
16685,"that would have been special , reimaginingh eroes has also beebn done by stan lee with superman and batman . it can be interesting ."
16686,did you know gtarfield had a special spinoff series where garfield and his gang were superheroes ?
16687,"i suppose it was not good , since i never heard of it , so mucj superheroes , 300 are registered in in the us ."
16688,"also , there are 30 or more superhero movies swedt for release between 2016 and 2020 . i hope they stay exciting ! nice talking with you ."
16689,"hello , are you a fan of supefhero movies ?"
16690,"hey there i do like uperhero movies . did you ever like garfield by the way ? apparently they did a spinoff we'e all of the garfield characters were superheroes , i needt o check that out"
16691,wow i never knew thayt ! i wonder how ofcten superberos come from comic books . i once read a comi cseries on fixing collateral damages cauxed by superyeros .
16692,wow how was it ? that's a very interesting topic for a superhero story i think . i can't eblievde how popular superhero movies are though . between the years 2016 and 2020 they are going tor elease about 30 superhero movies
16693,it was definitely interesintg ! there's so many superheroes though it's hard to quantify how much damage they cause . there's still over 300 registered superheroes in the us .
16694,wo wthat is a lot ! have you heard of stan lee ? he created a lot of classic marveo characters . but apparently he was about to chang ecareerw but then at the last minute thrh let him experimeht . he jade character such as spiderman and daredevil
16695,"i didn't know eh wanted to switch careers ! we're definitelyl ucky he didn't . i wonder who's considered the most influential out of superheroc reators like steve ditko , stan lee and jack kirby ."
16696,"yep those are all big names . i think that stan lee is actually kind of overrated , the more you read about him , but he did do some good things for the industry . did you know there's a book that someone wrote about how to become batman lol k want to reaf that and then do it haha"
16697,"wow i have no idea why people would think the need for that haha . i wondrer what's more unneccessary , that book or the creation of a superhero literally called ' normalman ' , who didnm't have nay superpowwrs ."
16698,haha thatd oes soudn pretty unnecessary . do you lik marvel comics ? or do you like dc comics more by the way ?
16699,"hmm i think i like marvel more . although they have shadyd walings , like arguing in cour5t that mutants aren't people , in order to aoid paying a higher rwte on toys ."
16700,"yep that is very sahdy . i like that mihcael jackson tried to buy marvel comics . he wanted to play spiderman , that would have been aw eird movi3 lol"
16701,oh wow that's surprising . it's interesting they didn't sell it to him . they once tried to sell the righ6s to all their characters to sony for 25 million . but they rejected the offer .
16702,i think that i heard abou tthat . a very dumb move that sony didn't buy that lok . what about the superhero called blue ear ? have you heard of him
16703,"i have no t! it sounds like a very different superhero than we're used fo , what?s unique about him ?"
16704,"well he was written for a vouryearold actually the fouryearold said that no superheroes had hearing aids , an dso marvel made him specifically for that 4 year old boy . thats' pretty nice of them"
16705,"aww , yea hthat's definitely swet of them , znd progessive . i doubt it was ever as successful wa sblack panther though , which was obvious;y created for different purposes ."
16706,"yep i agree with you . did you ever see the movie black panther by the way ? i thought ift was ok , nothing special"
16707,"i did ! yeah i thought it was alright , i thkought it was interesting that the main character is actually the richest superhero in history ."
16708,"i thought that was interesting too . it hink hes' eben richer than tony stark apparently .d id you hear how denzel washington actually loane dthe main character money in real life ? and then chadwick boseman thanked enzel washington 20 years later , that's insane !"
16709,"i xdidn't know that ! that's certainly some story , and eve nmakes me appreciate the film more . anyways it was nixe talking to you , have a good night !"
16710,hello do you like marvel comics ?
16711,"good morning . i do , and i'm still mourningt ghe dearh of stan lee . when my son gpoes to look at michigan state , i'm going to see if i can go look at the comic collection in their library , it's the larvest pulbi ccollection ."
16712,yea that wass sad that he passe daway . i saw that disne3y doesn't own the rights to show big marvel characters .
16713,"yeah , that is weird how hte ma5vel universe is distributed . wer were just at yniversal in florida , and they have all oc te marvel characters there . which struck, me kdd , as disney in cali has marvel there too . i didn't know that it had to do with the contract from the 90's ."
16714,hmm . . i didn't know that either . there is on edharacter owned byb oth marve and dc named access .
16715,"i heard something about him . do you know who ultron is ? the only thing i can think of , is the iro njan movie ."
16716,i do not know who that is . i saw that marvelc reated a comicb ook hero named blue ear and it was onky for a four year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing his heafign aida .
16717,"that was a great 6bing htey did . they based that on black bolt , an danson mount even met with the boy . stan lee signed off over tweet with ' excelsior ' , the same as he did his pyhonde conversations ."
16718,that is pretty cool . i saw taht stan lee ends every phone call he ha swith the word edcelsior .
16719,"that's what i just said , lol . hafe you xeen the garfiel comic , pet force ?"
16720,i have not .w hat is it ?
16721,"garfield and his friends are super heroes . it's ute . there is a superhero called ' normalman ' , he live on a planet full of superheroe s, and yet he has none ."
16722,i didn't know they were super heroes . that's interesting about njormalman .
16723,"who is y9ur fwavorite ? mine ist he winter soldier , and i think loki whines too much ."
16724,i would say i lov ewolverine . i saw there i sa comif serie sabout fixing collateral damage caused by suoerheroe s.
16725,"ic annot watch a nonx men movie with hugh jakman iojn it , and not call him wolverine . even austrlia , and the greatest showman . i hgave never heard of that series , i wonder if it ahs normal man in it or"
16726,that's interestin g. there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states . not really sure what that means lol .
16727,"i can believe it , as there are always more being added to the films . i was surprised to see red skull at the end of ibfinity wars . i think he has a giggr roe in end games . i still have trouble believing that sobny purchased tye rights to spiderman for 10 million ."
16728,i can't believe that eithef . i didn't thijk iy was worth 10 million .
16729,"i just wish they would stop redoing the s;idey movie s, and come up with new content . did you know that the dc stands for detective comics ?"
16730,it was great talking with you
16731,are you a stan lee or comic fan ?
16732,i am . i love watching for him in his movies . you ?
16733,"i do , funny he makes a cameo in his films . he does a very good job of making his characters relatable qith problems too ."
16734,yes he does . i think that is what makes his films so good . stan le elooked pretty good to be 95 though !
16735,absolutley ! i wasn't convinced he was that old .
16736,me either . no where near it ! have you seen avengers ?
16737,"i saw the first one , but not infinity war tet . mostly due to kids . how abouit you ?"
16738,i saw ifinity on netflix i think . was soo good . rellyn eat to see allt he characters ome together .
16739,"yea , seeing how they use their strengths together . i'll definitel7 watch infinity when i have time ."
16740,stan ele made it where all tose characters hsared a wolrd . very relatable .
16741,"oh definktely , they need to have some level of weakness to be more human"
16742,to see the marvel cahracters struggling justl ike we do makes his films relatable and fun .
16743,"like how spidermwn has probloems w8th his family , and finds himsel fawkward around mj"
16744,very nice for kids to see . did you know marvel had to got o court to prove that mutants weren't real ?
16745,i did not know that
16746,i5w as so they could pay a lower tax ate on the xmen toys .
16747,really ? so tax rates are lowdr for nonexistent hing slike that ? strange
16748,marvel also created a superhero called blue ear just for a boy who wearw hearing aids .
16749,i see that marvel tried to sell sony the ribhts fto almost all heroes and somy didn't buy .
16750,mistake on their part ! i woulod have loved to talk to sftan lde on the phon4e and hear him say excelsior !
16751,"yup , a hwole generation of cmic lovers will misxs that man !"
16752,have you been to many concerts ?
16753,no professional ones actually . you ?
16754,no but i would love to go see some of my favorite artists before they stop playing .
16755,i heard hat lou reed and his wife onceh eld a high frequency concert just for dogs !
16756,that is interesting . i wonder if the dogs appreciated it ?
16757,i would hope so ! do you like abba ? i did when i was a kid .
16758,i've never really listened to them . i was alwaysw more of a fan of either coutry or rock . i spent so much time listening tol inkin park in college .
16759,i heardl inkin park has held hte most concerts ever . do you think that is true ? i always liked foo fiyhter smyself .
16760,i know that they had 324 fo rtheir debutf ablum in 2001 . i think the record would probably have to go to the ramones . can you imagine touring for 20 years straihgt ! ?
16761,that ould be awfu l! did you hear about the woman who picked dave matthews up on the way to his concert ? he was broke down !
16762,aw that is nice that she did that . can you imagine how many ticked off fans there would have been if he hadn't mad it . it would have been a creed lawsuit repeat all over again .
16763,true ! all because he broke down . you ever listen to ariana grznde ?
16764,a little . if it is on the radio i probably won't tur it but i don't go out of my way to listen to her .w hat about you ?
16765,"nah , she's far to youg and al labout the money for me . but i was surprised to leanr she's not hispanic !"

16890,do you have a favorite marvel hero ? mine has to be iron man or captain america
16891,"i like t6he xmen , it's funny marvel comics had to cohvince the us government that xmen weren't humans"
16892,"i guess they made a lot of money with that arguemnt , disney bought the whole franchise right ?"
16893,"yea , thank god michael jackson didn't buy marvel comics , he wanted to star and prduce his own spiderman movie"
16894,"thank god he didnt lol , i agree with you , that would ruin the childhoods of many in the country ."
16895,"yea , maybe they could cast mj as the marvel hero blue ear"
16896,if he was still alice i bet they could and who is blue ear ? havbent heard of him before ?
16897,"blue ear is a superhero ho wears hearing aids , i guess he doesen't do anything else lol"
16898,"that sounds like a bad superpower lol , you know there are over 300 registered superheroes in the us"
16899,"i had no clue , i guess they will be releasing a lot more superhero movies after the 30 set for release between 20162020"

16901,"it be cool if htey mkade one with the garfield pet force superhero s, i loved that book as a kid"

16907,i believe his super power is super hearing . i hope theym ake a movie about him like aqua man
16908,"nice . that would b einteresting , i'm not sure hoe siper hearing is going to be like , punish the bad guys ? i could see it being a detective thing or something like that . or mqybe his physical power is overpowering too ?"
16909,there is only one of their superhero characters that has no special powers .
16910,"ahh , the ' normal person ' guy ? in eve4 heard of him before either . it's kinda sacarstic i like that idea . dubnno how teh plot is gonna go though ."
16911,i wonder how the oth5 300 superheros think of him ?
16912,"lol , cohld be anything . maybe they htink he is the su0perhero , not them . still , how is this going to be a plotd evice besides daily life comady i'm not sure ."
16913,here are lots of male superheros and only a few female ones . i wonder if they will ever create a gay hero or gensder neutra one
16914,"huh , mayb . i think there's a captain amrvel movie next year ,t his year ? , , and she s a big character , i mean , her own movie , , and black idow i thin k. but i guess we can argue black widow is a side kick , so is scarlett wiych ."
16915,i always had a crush on superwomna and catwoman
16916,"lol why ? i don't think they are marvel , i remember they are maybe dc ? i thought we are talking about marvel . i guess i can understand catwoman . . . superwoman maybe a little weird , no offense"
16917,"hard to keep the alliances straight some t8me . superheros have been around sincew the 30's , nearly 90 yearfs now"
16918,"yep , that's definately al ohg time . i think doctor who has been aroun a pretty long time too , not sure which one i slonger . makes me feel old thinking the3 0s has been 90 years from now . whst js alliances straight ?"
16919,hard to tell themf rom marvel or dc comics
16920,"ohh . yeah sometimesw . it' sa little conusing . i didn't watch much dc stuff , so i only know pretty much marvel stuff ."
16921,sad that the comic world lost stan lee thia year
16922,"yeah , that was super sad for everybody . i heard he nearly got scammed by a 7oung man out of his money earlief . it's sad when old people get ld . did you understand the part saying he ends every phone call with ' excelsior ' ? i don't quite get it ."
16923,quirky for sure .
16924,do you have a favorite superhero ?
16925,i have collectesd comicb ooks for years and stan lee's creations are some of my favorites . i love the xmen ands piderman . most marvel cimic books i enjoy .
16926,"yeah , stan lee's creations are phenomenal ! there are over 200 registered superheross , i wonder how many of those belong to stan ?"
16927,"i live in michigan , and have been to the msu library where they house the largest comic book collection in thew orld . it's pretty cool , to see in person ?"
16928,"oh i didn't know there3 was such a place ! i visit michigan often , will have to go check it out soem time . maybe i can find the character ' nrmlaman ' in that library somewhere , did you know he existed ?"
16929,"yes , i actuwlly knew od normalman . hwat i didnt' know though was that stan ele wrote 15 c , r detective comics , i always thought he was strictly a marvel man ."
16930,"really ? were any of th9os edc writings by stan lee made into movies ? i aplso didn't know that's what 'd c ' stood for , thanks for clarifying !"
16931,"i don't think the dc books were made into movies . dc cant' seem to get past batman , superman , and wonder wojan . marvel on the other hand is swilling top take risks . marvel once createf a character called blue ear just to help a 5 year oldb oy get uxed to wearing a hearing aid . marvel rocks ."
16932,"i know ! i'm a marvel ofer dc peron too ! i wish they'd put rhat character in movies because i npw someone with a hearing disability as well so 6ha twould help a lot ! surprised that disney doesn't own the rights to the wellknown marvel charactees in theme contracts due to a contract , so who owsn the rights to them ?"
16933,i know sony owns the right stgo some of marvels characters like venom . marvel went through hard times back in the day and sold thei rights to some characters off . they seem to be doing jus tfine today though making billions of dollars jut with their movies .
16934,"was it badm anagement that led them to ahrd times ? ort hey just simply didn't know ho to market their assets ? sony once had the opportunity to purchasee all the hcaractrs but only chose spiderman , what a poor decision !"
16935,i've heard stan lee actually didn't run the business smoothly back in the day . he turned the reins over long ago . heg ot to busy makin gmobie cameos . stan liked to end every phone conversation by using his xatch phrase excelsior ! ! ! ! !
16936,"stan lee needs to foxus on his creative and artistic talent ! not only does he make cameos in movies , i also enjoy trying to find his signaturds on marvel cahracters when int heme parks . i think marvel found a great homw i ndisney !"
16937,"yes disney will do great , they sill don't own the rights to everythi9ng htough like the avengers and x,en ."
16938,"how does one even begin to create charaters and universes l8kw what stna lee did , he even created a universe that takes place in earth199999 , which is a multiverse ."
16939,"stan was the man , but he had a ot of help from sdteve ditko and jac kirby . those are three comic book legends ."
16940,"oh , i've never heard of tehm but they are geniuses for sure ! have you ever read the series about fixing the collateral damage caused byt he supe5heroes ?"
16941,i have not read that series . i have reaqd a lot of comics from earth 616 which was marvelw original comic book universe .
16942,"does oi tfeature garfield in that setting , there's a series spinoff named pet force that featired garfield as hte superhero ."
16943,"garfield was in pet flrce , a comic that didn' tgo very far . thdys ay ther eare over 30 0registered superheroes in the u . s . but i thinkt hat sounds kind of low ."
16944,"oh wow , i thought 300 was a lot already but considerinmg that many series , i ened to reconsider ."
16945,hi how are you ? do you like xomic books ?
16946,i enjoy reading about comic books with superheroes sometimes .
16947,i don't read comic books much . i sometimes see the movies .
16948,"well comics are geeat sometimes , michael jackson even tried buyhing marvel comics once ."
16949,i guess he had the money . i woneer what he wul dhave done withm arvel .
16950,michael jackson wanted to play spidemran in his ow nproduced movie apprently .
16951,"hm . av anity project . i guess he could do it , but i prefer tobey for thwt role ."
16952,"3ell , marvel refusexd 60 ysars after they started , because they began in 1939 ."
16953,"ueah , that is good . disney probbly pai quite a bit for marvel , but it was worth it in my opinion ."
16954,yess uperhero movies are always profitable since it ststted in 1930 .
16955,"yes , the kids love them . i get tired of the sfx and the explosioms . i guess i have gotten tolo old for them . i liked deadpool though ."
16956,well th ekids are going to be peased to hear that there are about 30 superhero movies set to release from now to 2020 .
16957,"oh boy . well , i hop ethat ,any of them are lik edeadpool with the poty mouths and the sassy adult humod ."

16960,"i don't know , there are a couple to choose from ."
16961,wolverine ? professor x ? i don't know them well .

16982,"i know who the cahracter is and i think she's amazing ! i also think it'sa mazing the marvel nbradning began way back in 1961 the year they lauchdd the fantastic four ! lee , ditko , kirby and others really took comics t the next levle !"
16983,"that's interesgting , i lie the fantastic four ! ! i love the pet force with arfield , he makes me laugh just looking ayth im !"
16984,ha ! well did you knjow aout thbe garfield book series spinoff named pet force ? it featured garfield and his gfang as superheroes ! i bet that was hilarious too q
16985,"yes , that' swhat i meant pet force ! ! ove it . did you know in 1941 wkonder woman 2as placed in the justices ociety as a secretary ?"
16986,was she feally ? that's wild as she's come a long way since then ! i alsot hink uts' wild that disney doesn't own the rights to the bi gnamed marvel characters in theme parks east of the mississippji ! apparently it's because of a contract marvel and universal studios signed back in the 90s !
16987,"yes , j remember hwen that happened ! i go to the universal park and disney world alot ! tbe new wonder wonan in the new movie actually served 2 years as a soldier ! ! good chat ! !"
16988,"that's pretty cool ! boyt , she's been around since close to the time marvel started back in 1939 as timely publications ! ha ! well it was good chatting with you ! hope you have a great day , friend !"
16989,you too ! yeqhw as the higherst grossing w1 mpvie ! !
16990,"that is amazin ! well , i'm off to research fzamous funnies which was the first modern comic book released in the us back in 1933 !t ake care , frien !"
16991,hi there do you likem arvel comics ?
16992,arvel comics are pretty good . what about you ?
16993,yeah i like marel . the only comic i like from dc is batman actually . i remember when mwrvel was purcased by hte disney com;panby in 2009 . that seems like so long ago
16994,"disney has made so many superhero movies , i cannot keep track of them all ."
16995,"nope it's just too much at this point . funny that marvel had offered in 1998 to all of its characters to sony for only 25 million dol,ars period that was a blunder by sony to not buy the whole thing"
16996,"i guess sony wasn't hungry fr stories . once the internetg ot going , the characters could be used for all kinds of entertainmen . 25 mill ius nothin g."
16997,yep i agree . that's why they only decided to purchase spiderman for 10 million . they thought he was the only character that audiences cared about . oh how wrong they were
16998,"if you can make a spiderman movie for a profit , thete should be other movies that can be made . the executives are not creative . they don't understand narrative , just dollars ."
16999,yep that's what i think too . i guess there is actually a cahracter that is shared between marvel and dc . his name is access . all he does is keep both companies universes separate which i think is ab oble goal haha
17000,that would be an odd job to have . what if you fail ? who fire you ? and who pays you ? both amrvel and dc ? i have questions .
17001,these are great q7estions haha . did you hear abou7t the marvel superhero blue ear ?
17002,blue ear ?; no i didn't . is he movieworthy '
17003,"wlel apparently marvel created blue ear for an eightyearold boy ho wasw earing a eharin gaid . it was to help him feel better about wearinfg a hearin gaid because he said that superheroes don't wear hearing aids . thedefore , when marvel heard that theyc reated one that doesx"
17004,that's a great aid to a young fan . good for them !
17005,yep i think that was very noble . are there any comic books that you currently read ? i guess the first comic book was made in 1933
17006,i donh't read comics now . i was interested as a kid .
17007,i like them as a kid too . i gudss in real life stan lee would end every phone converxation he eve thad with the word excelsior !
17008,stan the mna ! he had a way about him . mych better than jim davis . garfield ? was there ever a funny on3 ?
17009,haha that's a good point . i enver got varfield but i thought he was ok i guess . did you know that dc in dc comics stands for detective comics
17010,"that's a bit redundant . anyway , i gotta go . i have a job as normalman on a planet full of superheroes ."
17011,great i'll keep an eys out for blue ear too haha . and check outty he michigan state university comic book library
17012,are you a superhero fan ?
17013,i just saw the avengers movie and liked it
17014,"i misse that one , but i cauhgt deadpool 2 this summer ."
17015,i have not seen that one but marvel makes a lot of good stuff . sony should have bought marvel when they had the chance
17016,they rdeally shluld have . so man companies pass up and i tends up being a huge mistake .
17017,i love hte fact taht marvel created a superehro who needed hearing aids specifically for a little boy
17018,aww . it always touches me when big name companies do thing like that . it helps kids out so much .
17019,fors ure . i think its funny that there is a characyer that is owned by both marvel and dc
17020,which one is that ?
17021,its name is access its whole purpose is to keep the 2 companie's universes separate
17022,wow . did you know marvel argued that mutants are not humant o pay a lower rate on x men toys instead of the higer rate for dollsd ?
17023,that seems like a good plan to me3 ! sabe money where you can . i like readign these chzracters jin comic books as well as movies
17024,me too . i like how thy were all misfits of a sorta nd finally found their place .
17025,marvel is pretty smart they published a generic comic books o they cohld rademark anmes like supehrero
17026,adn supervillian too . that was brilliant of them .
17027,i should have attended michigan state their .ibrary has a huge comic book collection
17028,"i bet that would be cool to visit , but they wouldnt let people check toom any things out though . i bet they have some rare things ."
17029,for sure some old dcx comics did you know dc dstands for detective comics
17030,thats a bt redundant isnt it ? lol
17031,just a bt . . is that a stan lee one ? he is quite the character
17032,"he was indeed , ended each phone c0onvo with excelsior !"
17033,yes there are differejt multiverses in his books !
17034,good moning ! do you like marvel movies or comics ?
17035,i love marvel comics and movies and stan lee . how about you ?
17036,same here ! i learned recetnly that marvel started wa7y back in 1939 ! i had no idea !
17037,reallg ! ! that is a long time ago . do you know who acquired marvel entertainment ?
17038,"that i do kmnow because of all of the uproar about itg . it's disney , right ?"
17039,you're corect . it was the walt disney company . do you happen to know who created the fantastoc four and other superhero titles ?
17040,i assme it was stan lee . i just always thought he did all of it .
17041,it was stanl ee among others like steve ditko ad jack kirby .
17042,"i'm not familiar with those two . ey , speaking of disney a bit ago . did you hea5 about them not owning teh rights to show big marvel characters in threme parks ?"
17043,no i didn' t. i aslo read somewher etha tmkchael nackson tried to buy margvel comics in early 90s .
17044,i didn't know that ! do you know why he dudn't ?
17045,he did iut so that he could plahy spiderman in his own movie .
17046,oh ! that would have been interesting to see . it's odd that he failedx though . marvel tried to sell movie rights of almosta ll of it'a charactera to sony back in 1998 but they said no .
17047,i guess the dela fell through between the two companies . i didnt' know this
17048,"yeah , marvel wan6ed 25 million . sony rejected that and just boughgt the rights to spidermna for 1o million because tehy thought people only cared about h8m ."
17049,i dudn't know this . thanks . did you know thay dc comics paid 130 for the exclusive rights to superman ?
17050,"nope , but i'd say they got a heck of a eeal ! superman has probably made them tons of money !"
17051,y3s . superman did make them a lof of money indeed .
17052,i heard that dc from dc comicss tands for detective comics .
17053,wow ! ! ! ghat is very interesting . i disn't know this .
17054,"something e;se that's interesting , at least to me that is , is that michigan state university library has the largest publicly available comic book co.llection in the world ! you should ceck it out . as for me , i've got to go now ! it's beeng reat chattimg with you ! have a great day !"
17055,good morning .
17056,good morning !
17057,the recen5 passing of stan lee is sd .
17058,"i agre q i was never super into comics , but he was absolutely legendary for what he accomplished . it's awful to hear about the allegations of elder abuse though ."
17059,"yes it is . he seemed so devoted to ghis wife , she helped him build his empire ."
17060,"i caj't imagine how heartbreaking it was for him to lose her , especizlly since they wer etogether for seven decades . it's not surprising that everything seemed to go downhill after that ."
17061,the person taking care of him was arrested fpr filing a false claim ? he was taking advantage or his age and health .
17062,"that's awcful ! it' scisgusting how someon ecould take advantage of someone because they're old and senile . it'sh orrible the way they jsolated him fron his friends and loved ones toward the end of his life ,"
17063,did you know marvel comics started in 1939 !
17064,"oh my god ! that's injsane . i had no idea they'd been waround this lont ! and it doesn't look like they're going anywhere , i heard 30 supehrero movies were se to be released between 20162020 ."
17065,that is amazing . stan lee used go end all his phone conversatons with the word ' excelsior '
17066,"that's adorable ! you know , i wonder if he regrets selling the righs to superma fir only 130 ."
17067,"he has made so much k, i am not sure if he regrets . there is a superhero called normalman !"
17068,now that's hialious ! i'd totally consider watching a superhero movie i fit was about this ' normalamn '
17069,he is the only person on the planet without superpowers .
17070,"are you a big fan of com,ics ?"
17071,i am . i love reading them and wtching all the movies . michigan srtate university library has the largest publicly avaialbel comic booj colection .
17072,"cool ! which superh4ro is your favorite ? i had no idea ! that's awesome .a pparently michal jackson really wanted to play spiderman , do much so that het ried to buy marvel comics in the 90's ."
17073,i like spider man . i also like aquaman . there is a new one coming out soon . i didj't know that about michael jackson .
17074,"i heard about aquaman ! jason momoa is gorgeous so i'll probably consider seeing that one . insane , right ? i'm glad they didn't sel to him ."
17075,ha . i was goign to say tne same about jason momoa did you know stan lee wrote 15 dc comics .
17076,"wow , i had no clue . it was really lovely talking to you tday !"
17077,you too . i hope you have a great rest of thed ay .
17078,same to you !
17079,hey what did you think about sta nlee when he was alive ?
17080,i thoughf he was a nice man . some believe hollywood as we mnow it now wouldn'tb e the sam ebecause of how het old superhero stories .
17081,"think you're right . it's amazing thwt he lived unti the ae of 9r ,t hat' sa lohg time nad he had a lot of history with comic booksa nd their promotion"
17082,apparently he wrote for dc comics at one point as opposed to marvel nad reimagined batman and superman . i find that interesting .
17083,yes nd i think the hest thing about his creatiosdn qere that they were always very relatable characters and not overpowered
17084,something i find funny is dc comics is detective comics comics . wonder how that got throughc orporate ?
17085,that is funny that that is what it stands or . what do you think about marvel comicx though ? di dyou knows ony rejected an offer to buy all of the rights to marvel comics for only 25 million dollars
17086,"i like marvel , they;ve been around since 1939 . theh have a lot of cool characters like captain ameroca and the hulk . what about you ?"
17087,"yeah i like marvel a lot more , ir elaly like the xmen , it's interesting that disney does not have the rights 5o the mxen in rheme parks that are east of the mississippi"
17088,i wonder if they are one orf the over 300 registered suerheroesd in the united states ? i am assumkng 8t is for copyright reasons .
17089,yeah rhat's a good question . what do you think about the superhero lue ear ? it was made specifically for a deaf child
17090,"never heard of it to be hones6 , s0unds itneresting . i do know o one called access wo is a joint collaboration between dc and marvel ."
17091,"yeah you'rer ight , that character can go between both sets of universes , the other thing i love abouts tanley is that you will end every phone call with tne word excelsior , i miss him"
17092,wlel this whole superhero craze took off with iron man in 2008 . it introduced the iea of a universe of superheroes ibnstead of them all in their own separate planet ea4th .
17093,yep i think that's a good idea . have you ever been to the wor;d's largest comic bookc ollection ? apparently that exists in th euniverdsity of michigan library
17094,"no , i don't really collect them . i do like the ,movies though , black panther was really good . stan lee creqted him of course ."
17095,"are black panther was pretty good ,. what do you think about the idea of gaerfield as a superhero though"
17096,"why not ? he's got pals , i think it would be pretty funny . garfield always struck mea sl azy though ."
17097,yeqh maybe that's his superpower is laziness lol . they habe a superh4ero name dnormalman so i don't think gwrfield would be a huge stretch
17098,"well ever since 1939 whe n8t was named timely publications , marvel has bene making comics and now they are owned by the biggest entertainment conglomerat4 in the world so they must have done something right ."
17099,"i agree with you . it's crazy that comic book started in the 1930s to , thats eems so long ago"
17100,heolo . i would love to have joined the march for our lives
17101,i lov the csuse . it wa sabout 2 million people

17123,after something like that i'd want to go home and listne to some music . . . do you like bruno mars ?
17124,"i do like bruno mars his one of my favorite artists , whaf about you , do you like him ?"
17125,"i do , but i didn't know until recenly that his rel name is peter gene hernandrez ."
17126,i guess its a good thing his got an artistic name lol i dont see peter gene sellibg a lot of albums
17127,i wondrr if ge picked ' mars ' like the planet becsuse he thinks he i s' out of this world . ' lol
17128,"i think thats accurate , i mean he truly is unique , he writes his own music and few ar6iat do that"
17129,that is definitely unique ! so are the dogs i just heard about in moscow that have actually learned to ride the subway .
17130,"dogs are really smart so that doesnt surprise me , you know xogs are not colorblind the cqn also see colors but no tas much as humans ."
17131,"i remember elarning that on the sesame street shos . i think bruno mars was on that show once , too !"
17132,"he was ? i missed that episode lol , marx was nmaeds fter a wressler , bruno sammartino"
17133,mars is a pretty cool planet . i think i once heard the sunsets are bue .? . l the opposite of ours . i wis hic ould see it !
17134,"it must be a beautiful plane5 to visit , theres a colonisation project planned for year 2023 , i hope they make it ."
17135,2023 ? that doesn't szeem like nearly eough time . i wonder what all thd know that we don't realze yet ?
17136,"its a short time but maybe thinhgs are almost set up , it most vbe q relly expensive promect though , i would sure watch that reality tv show ."
17137,makesm e wonder if mars has some time of resource that we will bew anting to extract . . . ?
17138,"im sure there are a lot of valuable minerla sand also water w3 just have to dig deeper , there is a lost satellite on mars 8i wonde3r if the reality tv crew can recover it ."
17139,meant type of resource . lol they say it is red from iron . . . i wonderr if we ned more iron for al; he machines we are making to take over the workgorce ?
17140,"im not sure but i dont think finding iron is wofth it , tbere must he gold and othere valuable mineraks in the plan t, maybe unknown minedrals to men , who knows what can be found there ."
17141,yeah i think iron would be too heavuy to take all the way from mars . i wonder if we even can study new bacteria there ?
17142,yeah i bet batedia can be studieda nd we can find new forms ofl ife for sure even jf they are microscopic .
17143,are you a dog or a cat person ? kmaybe fan of neiter of thsoe animals
17144,hello i oovs dogs . not a huge fan of cats . what about you ?

17153,"it must , i heart hat lichens and cyanobacteria can oive in the planet so mayeb we can some day"
17154,"very interesting . going back to dogs , did you now istabul has vending machines that dispense water and food for stray dogs in exchange for plastic bottle s?"
17155,"no i didnt know thsat , sounds like thereds a kot of happy doggies in istanbul , good strza6egy to keep the streets clean"
17156,very great idea . dogs and elephant are the only animls to understand pointing .
17157,dogs can also see color so they are really smart animals
17158,i alwsays thought they were colorblind .

17168,"nah , not my kind off lick . some of the super ero movies are ok , like the batmans with bal ewere great . but some kinhd of suvk ."
17169,"gal gadot thought she was auditioning for cat woman when she did the first audition for wonder woman , so maybe she is a bafmwn fan ."

17176,"interesting , is that the one withb illy crystal ?"
17177,"blazing saddles is z me, brook comesy film in the 70s . the cowboy movie with billy crystal is city slickers and was filmed in the 90s ."
17178,"whoops , i dkon't think i'bve seen the mel brooks film . is it any good ?"
17179,"oh yeah it is a classic , but it is wacky or abhsurd style of comedy . if you don't like that style , you will be angry that it got 3 nominations ."
17180,inter4sting . i don't think those awardzs mean anything anyways .
17181,"you are kind of righ t, emine mwon more oscars than georges lucas , bill murray and leonardo decaprio combined ."
17182,"this is interesting . what did he3 win them for , do you kno w?"
17183,"he did a movie . maybe he won one for that , but most of them would be for best song ."
17184,itneresting . i was wondering if it was fpr 8 mile . anyways nice chatting with you !
17185,"you too , have a food afternoon ."
17186,hey are you going to watch teh academy awards this year ?
17187,probably not . i don't have cable any mre . are you ?
17188,"no i don't have cable , and i don't eve nwatch regular tv haha . sually i just check on who won though , are you going to check on that ? you ever watch movies at al"
17189,i dopn't usually checl will probably see the winnwers on facebook . i like to watch movies wand tv shws on hulu or netflix . pretty cool taht the academy awards have beehn around since 1930 when it was rboadcasted on the radio .
17190,"i think that's pretty cool too . and their first tv broadcast was back in1 953 . it's interestingt hat they are the larges tand odles5 worldwide entertainnent awards ceremony , i wonder what other countries watch them ? maybe france or something does"
17191,have you seen the latest wonder woman movie ?
17192,"yes i saw that . it took place in wor;ld war 1 , which is very unusal setting for movie i think . what did 7you loke about i t? personally i thought it was ok"
17193,"saounds interesting i haven't seen it , but i would like to . gak gadot served two years as a soldier in the israel defense forces , i was surprisedt o learn ."
17194,"that is interesting . i think that all israeli citizens have to do that though . and yes , that movie is theh ighest grossing superhero origin movie , and also highest grossing world war one movie . they should make more worl dwar 1 movies i think"
17195,oh i didn't know that about israeli citizens . i agree about making more wsw1 movies .
17196,"i guess in 2017 that was the yeqar where are the top three most successful movies were all led by females , that makes sense ghough , that's the year that star wars and beaut and the beast and wonder woman all came iut"
17197,have you seen star wars or beauty and the beast ? i've only seen beautya nd the beast .
17198,"i have seej both of those . i really hated the star wars movie . i thought they ruined luke skywalker . and i thought beauty and the beast was ok , i think that tehy just stole everything from the cartoon version , and it was almost exactly the same , except they made new additions that were not as good , what do you thinkj ?"
17199,i thought it was just okay too . i was kind of disappointed with some of thr special effects like the cuharacter of lumiere didn't look right to me .
17200,yeah i agree wiht you he looks weird in the movie . it's funny that gal gadot thought she was testing for the rple of catwoman . that is a completely differet role lo.
17201,"yeah htat is not even close , haha ."
17202,"pretty funhny how times have changed so un terms of female representation . whn she was a member o fth ejustice society , and that was back in 1941 , i guess they made her a secretary .ol definitely not na acceptable way to show hern owadays"
17203,yes times have changed for sure . pretty crazy that the su ncan produce energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500000 years .
17204,"that is impressive . i wish we could hanres sthat somehow , that would really help save the planet i think . it's all so crazy that the sun is actually white , you're always faught in sch0ol that it's yellow , but that's because of our atmosphere"
17205,yeah that is cool . and it is only 1 billiontht he xsize of the b9gges tstar discovered in our galaxy .
17206,"it seems small , but the sun is axctjally huge , the diameter is 110 timws th esizd of earth , that's crazy because the earth is already huge in my opinion haha"
17207,did you know that wonder woman is the top grossing super hero origin movie ? i didn't know that
17208,no . i would have guessesd black panther . womder woman is a dc character which i prefer to marvel .
17209,"see i like batman as my favorite overall superyero ,s o h is dc , but i can't say i'm a fan of the rest of the c characters , theys eem too unbelievable , who are your favorite sc characters ?"
17210,i grew up with superma comics . such a powerful superhero makes the writers have to come up wth prepostereous villains though . it is interesting taht gal gadot was really a soldier for israel .
17211,"yes that definitely adds more legitimacy to her charfacter , but i do tink eveery israeli is required by law to serve in the military , but that still is an interesting fact"
17212,"her firstm ovie was batman , your guy , vs superman , my guy , in 2016 . she signed for 3 movies in her first contract which kept her price low ."
17213,"ahhw i like that , your guyv s my guy , wha tdid you thin kof that movie ? i still like christopher feev as yhe best superman , superman 1a nd 2 are really good movies still , canm't say i'm too thrilled with the current superman movies"
17214,it was a watchable movie . i agree with reeve s superman . 2017 wzs the first yeat sicne 1958 that the top 3 grossing domestic films ad a female lead .
17215,"ya that is shocking , you mentioned gal gseot , i guess when she audigioned for wonder woman she thought it was originally a try out for catwoman , which wouldh av ebeen a much different movie haha"
17216,"whe nthe character was introduced to the justicel eaue , they made her be rhe secretary . that would not fl in th eclimate of political vorrectness o today ."
17217,"oh no not at all , it's crazy how quicklyh times change , i also think its crazy tha twojnde rwoman was the hghest grossing wwi movie , you don't see too manh movies based on that war"
17218,that is t5ue . it isa lso interesting that one of the producrs was a chinese company . i suspect that eomheow helped thje film appwar on more screens in china .
17219,"haha yes i defnitely that thwat factored into it l do you liek daniel daylewis , i can't believe taht he won an oscar for best actor 3 times , that is crazy"
17220,he does hwat he does well . they have been giving oscars wsince 1929 . this year there will not be a host becauze of political correctness .
17221,"did they not pick a host now ? i know they changed it from kevin hart or something , i try not to read the news because it is too depressing and exhausting , i like random facts like how a lightening bol5 is five timds hotter htan the urface of the sun haha"
17222,"no . they are going without a host . i cannot conceivd of a star one billion times as lrge a sour sun , yet one exists in our galaxy ."
17223,"what is wild too is that the sun nakes enough enerfy in one second to meet our planet'a needs for 500 , 000 years , i don't see how w ecan't capture some of that"
17224,surely future generations will get better a6 doing that . it is clearly the most important energy source in our solar systek .
17225,"yes the future will definitely improve our technokoy , i think it's wild that the sun is actuall white , it's just because of our atmksphere that it appears yellow in the sky"
17226,i agree . i thouht it was yellow because it was not as hot as aw hjte star but is hotter than a red one . how about nheptune only orbitingt he sun once since it was discovered ?
17227,"yes that seems odd , i wonder if we will get to visit any of these dixstant planets in our lifetime , what do you think ?"
17228,"did you kow that dog's have 12 different blood 5ype , ad that they can donate blood at blood drives for dogs ?"
17229,no i didnt know that . i love dogs . best kind of helpers there are . vsry good for the disable . have you any experience with that kind of help from dogs ?
17230,"i have a dog , he's not much of a physical help , but he's emotional suppirt . he keeps me company and always makes me laugh ."
17231,"thants super sweet . i wonderw hat a dog or any other kijd of animal would do on a different plant . lets say mars . i know its a l0ngw ay , but still fun to think about"
17232,it would be weird if dogs ruled mars . that would be s concept .
17233,very weird . i know the atmosphere has alot to do with it . but still somone got to atleast put it in a movie so we can see it . heard about the 2013 plan for mqrs ?
17234,yeha i heard that theres' a colonization project planned for 2023 thag will be fumded by creating a realoty tv show .
17235,now thats crazy ! they should bring dogs . . . they could make for better tc .d ogs ar epretty intelligent .
17236,yeah they are . did you know that googel prefers dogs to cags ? their code of conduct specifically states taht ghey are a dog company . that makes me want to support them more .
17237,thats so cool to know . i know my dog also kinda acts like me at time . dogs just pick up n our behavior . i do wish thney could pick up us talking lol
17238,"my dog is lazy like m e, like right now he's just sitting in my chair with me . i wish my dog could talk som4times just so i could know what he wanted instead of just starin gat me ."
17239,"lol same . or if they could sing , when i do pla music my dog barks in rhythm . any time i listen to bruno mars he loves it . . . . you like his music ?"
17240,"that's awesome . mjne just looks at me weird when i sing . i do like music though , i'm always listening to it ."
17241,i love how he writes some of the best songs . interesting to know he uset o be with motown . lve that labe .
17242,"he's very talented and he writes his own music , that speaks a lot for his talent ."
17243,"he started off as an elvis , which i have seen on youtube . very interdsting to see . maye he will go to mars on that reality showl ol"
17244,he could be the host of it !
17245,hahah totally ! and play all the music on hte planhet .
17246,he coud wrestle people sonce he wasn amed after professional wrestle bruno sammartino .
17247,"hayaha that would be entertaining toop . dont forget about the dog , ir ha sto be there to trying to sing ad being a helped paw hand lol"
17248,tjat would be epic ! it was nice fchattung with you !
17249,hey there do you like dogs or cats more ? i'm definoeoy a dogs persoh
17250,same here ! they are man's best friend q
17251,"yep i agree ! and i neve rknew that they had 12 different blood types , that's crzzy ! i htink humans onl have like five or six"
17252,isn'tt hat crazy ? dogs can akeso donate blood at dog blooed drives . lol
17253,that's interesting i hope they get a treat afterwards ! i think it's craxy thought hat onkly two types of animals can ujnderdstand buman pointing and they are the elephant and the dog
17254,i agree ! i likeh ow google ks a dogc ompany and prefers dogs to cats . they even state in 5heir code of conduct that they are a dog company .
17255,"that is pretty cool . ia lso like what isfanbul is doing with their stray dogs , they are training them tk pick up garbage and then they eill get food once they deliver the garbage to the recycling center"
17256,that's a great idea ! did you know that dogs are no tcolor blind ? they just can't see as any different clors as humans .
17257,"no i dodn't know that . i wonder why people say that all the time . on a different note though , do you ever think about the planet mars ? it's te re planet in our solar system"
17258,i do . it's also the fourth planet from the sun and the second smallest planet in the solar system after mercury .
17259,yes you're right . it's also crazy that if you and iw ere there right now our voices would be higherpitched because of the difference in the atmosphere on mars vs . eart
17260,interesting ! lichens and cyanobacteriwa would be able to thrive on mars .
17261,"it i sinterestign . it's also interesting that they are trying to plan a mars colonization ;roject that will be funded bh a reality show , i really want to see that !"
17262,that would be fun to watch . a satlelite was ost on mar sbefause locheed martin used the imperia system while nasa used the metric system .
17263,"haha tat is funny . i remembe rwhen that happened . it's also crazy that if wec oudl just travel at one unit of gfavity acceleratfion then we ckuldg et to mars in 2 days , i hope we can do that in our ,ifetime"
17264,that would be awesome ! do you know much about bruno mars ?
17265,in a little bit . i know that he was born in 1985 ad is vcery talented he writes his own music
17266,yes . he was signed and dropped by motown records years befre becoming a success .
17267,"well that is cool . and he was also anm3d after a professional wrestler , bruno sammartino"
17268,that is neat ! do you know how bruno mars started iout ?
17269,"yes i believe he started as a nelvis impersonator and didn't even use his original na,e when he started doing live performances"
17270,what do you think about liberal arts degrees ? personally i don'tt hink there is important as engineering degrees
17271,i agree . i dont think they are important as engineering degreea . do you know much about artififal intleligence ?
17272,yeah i know a little bit . apparetnly there is a nonprfit organization that is constamtly trying to advance i research
17273,yeah adn stanford has a class that uses google hangouts go help them teahc more efficiently .
17274,yeah that' pretty cool . i think it's scary that facebook is developing an ai thouhg . itw ould be able to predict users actions and meotions
17275,"that is creepy , i have seen some youtube video on actual ai robots , they are weird ."
17276,"yeah i think a g8y is creepy . it's also c4razy that there as an ai that scientists created who could beat humans at a pu8zzle game called 2048 , i don't like that !"
17277,yeah thedre is a huget heory that way in the future humans will be like pets of ai's or raised in captivity of the ai robots .
17278,"yeah tha twouldn't surprise me . it does surprise me yhojugh that thea ctress from the twilight series , kristen stewat , actually authored a paper on artificial intelligence , i did noft see that coming lol"
17279,"oh wow , thats cool i guesse . i hope she is better at writing ."
17280,"yes , i hope she's good at writing . i don't cazre for her acting , personally . do you ever rea dany books by the way ? apparently the fda burned six tons of books a tsome point in an act of censorship"
17281,wosw htats a big statement .
17282,"yeah i think it's scary ;. i used to read a lot of books bjt not so much anymore , and i never knew thar kissing in a romantic fashion is actually a recent development and was not presen tin greek literature"
17283,me either ! that is interes6ting . i would like to see the contest were author scome up with the worst opejing setence .
17284,"yeah i wonder what that woulx be haha . what do you think about winston churchill by the 2ay ? apparently he won a nobe4l prize for literature not peace , but i know he was syper important durimg world war ii so i wonder why that is"
17285,"i know h was the prim eminister of englnd and they made a movie about it lolt hats awedsome , wow nobel prize !"
17286,"yes thats impressive ! i'm shocked that architecture , liyterature , painting , and music were originwlly olympic events ! i wonder how they judged that ? it must just be very subjeftive"
17287,i feel liek olympics shluld be a physical competition . those subjects should be a different 4vent lol
17288,haha yes i agreew ith you . are using a computer right now ? i know that i am and i find it scary that there are people that would upload tehir brains to a computer ! what if you got a virus
17289,"wow that ia some sci fo stuff , hjave you ever seen that show black mirr9r ? well they have an episode on that it wasc reepy . i would definitely be scared to so something like that l"
17290,"i have see nthat show . i do like it , have y0u hezrd of the compute4r that tne russians made ? apparently the made itb ack in 1936 and it can run on water , but anyway take carfe was a great chat"
17291,wijston churchill won a nobel peace prize for in literature not peace .
17292,"huh hat is interestinfg , i like wwik history it's one of my hobbies , he played a very importsn trole in that war"
17293,i w9sh i had the patience for it . edgar a . poe rwceived 9 for his poem the faven .
17294,"that is too bad that is a great poem , did you know that romantic kissing didn't always ex8st and is a recent invention"
17295,i did not hard to believe . did you know that there is a poen that when read is depressing but when read backward is inspiring .
17296,"no i din't i want to see that poem , have you heard of the fantasy author terry pratxhtt ?"
17297,i haven't but id like to see that poem as well . you know if you publish a book in norway the government will purchase 1000 copies .
17298,"oookf well at least yoy have guaranteed sales , anyway terry was knighted for hjs ' services to ligerature ' which is interesting i never heard of him"
17299,me either . there are more librari4s in the us than htere are micky d's
17300,"well that is gooda t least , did you know there is a professor that teaches heavy metal as a for4m of piterature , don't know that . i dont' like that and i like heavy metal"
17301,not me so much anymore . did you know the fda burn 6 rons of literature as an act of censorship .
17302,no i didn't m do you know why th3y burendtf he books ? that seems really weird
17303,they weret rying to censor something they did not wsant to get out i'm assuming .
17304,"ah i see , what i do think is crazy is that art , music , and poetry were olympic sports back in the day"
17305,poetry bhas a history ating back to prehost9rical times . creations like hunting poetry in africa
17306,"that is crazy , and apparently the vikings were warriorpoets , they kileld people abd aoso wote poetry"
17307,javanese alphabet when recited in order forms a piem
17308,"interesting i wonder what it ssays , do you lie ktupac ? apparently he studied powtry in school"
17309,i was a big fan ihn my younger years . i do believe he prided himself on bsing a poet .
17310,"ya i think so , i never listened to his music personally , i did watch lord of the rings sand app0arently tolkien would laugh at bad poetry with his friends"
17311,"interesting . well it was nice alking with you , enjoy the rest of the day ."
17312,"grdat you too , make sur4e to chec kout some poetry like the 274 line poem called ' the chaos '"
17313,i love to read especiallgy fiction . do you feel the same ?
17314,"i am an avid reader , moest of mine is i nnon rict9ion , but i occasiobally dabble in ths fiction realm"
17315,did youk now tha6 romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and it is rarely mentioned in old literature ?
17316,"nho , i kind o fexpected htat to be a hting that has been artound for a while , in the literature realm at least"
17317,me too . i woncer why it waa not really a practice a lon gtime ago . how do youf eel about censorship i nliterature ?
17318,"i think it is horrible , especially the burning of lterature . such a waste"
17319,i agree l i ma totally against censorship . the fda burned six tons f literature in an act of censorship in the us . that's devastating to me .
17320,"ia gree , especially for eomething that actually was once an onlympic event , you tgink it would be valued more"
17321,literature was an olympic event ? ! that's so strange . i don't even know how taht would work .
17322,"along with music , culpture , painting and architecture in both 1912 and 1932 . im not sure how you compete in those , but im all fir the arts"
17323,i'm for it to but im also curius how yoiu would compete . dod you kn9w that poe only receivrd 9 for the publication of the raven ? thats' so sad that his genius swas not credited until after his deatg .
17324,"that must have been frustrating for him . he is such an iconic poet now , too bad his talnet wasn't recognized when he was alive ."
17325,i agree . did you know that churchil won a nobel prize for lterature but not one for peace ?
17326,"i always thought his prize was for peace , that is really interesting ."
17327,it is very unexpected . i don't get there much anymore but i used to go to the library a lot . ow about you ?
17328,"8 havent been in forever . i usually just buy books now , i really shoudl go back and chrck it outg . i think it is cool that sacramento has al ibrary of things tha tpeople can check out that they need briefly but not long term ."
17329,that is an amazing idea . i wish i had access to a place like that . i am very glad that there are still more libraries in the us than mcdonald's . we need to keep libraries protected .
17330,"we really do , we eed support for lit4rature too like in norway whe4e if you publish a book , the government willb uy 1000 copies to put them in libraries ."
17331,that's a fantastic idea also . it's good for the writer and the library . i am also gladt hat half of adults still have library cards . i actually just went and got mine fenewed yesterday . you can do so much with 6hem now . mine even hjas audiobook syou can access online .
17332,really ? i should definitely check in to that . that would be cheaper than using audible . i remember in college using the mircoform machines to read awrticles .
17333,way cheaper . i've never actually used one of those machines but j know we used to have them .
17334,"what do you think is a more important degree , liberal ats or engineering ?"
17335,"i think both have their place . i'm a science person myself , with a degree in chemistry , but i can totally appreciate studying more artistic things . how about you ?"
17336,"yes i have an enineering degree , personally i think engineering is much more important than liberal arts , anyone can elarn al iberal arts degree but that's just my opiniin ."
17337,"yah k agree that engineering is far more complex , but i still think that liberazl arts are important . maybe not to get a ob , so it might be a waste of money to pursue that kind of degre e, but the subjecr itself is worthwhile in my opinion . do you kow much about ai ?"
17338,i know a little bita bout it . i think there is a nonprofit organization actually that is responsible fr prtomotibg development of artificial intelligence
17339,that's really cool ! i read that faceboo kis developing an artificial intelligene that can understand human emotions an dpredict behavior . kind of crazy !
17340,"wow that is vcrazy ! i like stanford's idwea though , they are using artificial intelligence to help to teach students more efficiently with google hangouts"
17341,i think htat's great ! it makes classe sso much more accessible to people . sid you know kristen stewart coauthored an artificial inge.ligence paper ? iw onder hoe that turned out . . .
17342,"wow i didn' tkhnow that was interested in artificial intleligence k, did yu know that artificial intelligence can crush all human records in puzzlesolving"
17343,"yeah i read that they beat all of the recorss foer the game ' 2048 ' , but i'm not familiar with that game are you ?"
17344,"no i've never played that game before , but 8t sounds very complex , do you read any books on artificial itnelligence by the way"
17345,i never have ! honestly its not something ik now much about . hzave you read on the subject ?
17346,"no i hnaven't reada bout artigficial intelligecne but i do you like to read on occasion , i even found oug recently taht romantic kissing s a recent invention and thag they did not kiss each other back in the ancoient greeks ti9me"
17347,i readt hat to ! i also enjoy reading apparently literature used to be an olympic event . i wonder how htat worked ?
17348,"it is a great question , it's also a 4eal question o nwhy the fda burned six tons of literature m thats ounds like censorship t me"
17349,"thats an insane amount of censorship , do you know when that happened ?"
17350,"nl i don't know when or why bug it sounds very dubious to me ,w hat do you think about winston churchill winning the nobl peace prize ?"
17351,i was really surprised to find that he won for literature and not peace 2 did you know that there is a contest every year where writers compete to come up with the worst opening sentence to a novel ?
17352,"no i've never heard about that , do they use computers when they're writing ? apparently there are people claled transhumanists how o upload their souls into computers"
17353,. . . no way ? that's insane ! i've never heard of that bdefore . i wonder how they think they'll do that ? i think i remmeber seeing a johnjy depp movie where he did somethong like that lol
17354,"yeah i think i saw that movie too , i also wantt o see a movie about the russian computer thar runs on water , they invented it back in 1936"
17355,"hi , do you ever get a chance to go to the library ?"
17356,"i do on occasion . i really want to check out that library in sacramento that allows patrobs to check out more than just books , stuff that's useful but also stuff we don't want to own in the long run . what about you ?"
17357,a tool library is a great idea . it makes life so much easier for people that czn't affords ome basic tools . i don't usually get tp the library much . i do research online .
17358,i understand ! but luckily there re ore libraries than there are mcdpnald' shere in the united states ! plus half the adult population owns library cards ! that gives me a little hope ! ha !
17359,"if they ciould xombine the two , it would be great ! ge6 soe books for the mind , and food for the big bellh ! a hppy combo !"
17360,"that is a great idea ! ha ! never considered that ! so are you also a fan of poetry byc hance ? i pe5zsonally love that one poem that is depressing when you rea dit , but inspiring when you read it backwards !"
17361,i never heard of that poem . i guess it must be famous . never read it in scfhool . i wond3r who wrote it . i don't know mucj about poetry .
17362,"it's very interesting . i highly recommend it to you ! if you're a fan of the hobbit , nearly if the chawracter names were tyaken from an icelandic poem called dvergatal ."
17363,"tolkien loved language , so i'm not surprised that he took names fro mobscude sources . he wrote the lotr series becausew he cpuld create languayes for the different races ."
17364,"that's pretty interesting ! hey , even the javanese alphabet actually forms a poem when it's recited i norder ! that is amazing !"
17365,"i guess it's jot like the abc song , which i sjust letters . kanguage is fascinating . i'm shocxked that 4dgar a.lan poe only received 9 for hte publicatipon of his poem , ' the raven . '"
17366,that is shocking considering how legednary it is today . he was rippd off ! wonddr if demetrei martin 5eceived much for the 224 word pzalindrome poem he wrote ?
17367,"a palindrom ethat long ,must have taken yearz to write . how did he do it ? did he win ana ward ? i hope so ."
17368,"i hope so as well ! but all in all , i'm a fan of literature in general ; it' scrazy to think winston churchil lwon a nobel prize for lit6erathure and not peace back in 1953 ."
17369,i would expect churchill to have won for something else likr peace because eh tried so hard to end war and help the world . i guess he wrote a good mmeoir or something ? i don't know .
17370,i suppose so but you do make a great poitn there ! can you also believe the fda once burned six tons of literature in an aqct of us censorship ? that is unbelievable and ridiculous !
17371,i guessyt hey thought they wer ehelpign te country and its moality . silly . too many books g3t banned . i think it's part of freedom of speech to read what you want .
17372,"exaclty ! heck , even literature along with architecture , paitning , music , etc . were all olympic events up unti l1942 !"
17373,"i find that strang e. h9w are those things athletic ? there should be contest s, but in a different arean . not spts ."
17374,"i suppose that's why they got rid of them . but in a humorous note , there's actually a contest that challenge writers to come up with horrible opening sentences for hnovels . i'd loge to see some of thse examples . ha !"
17375,"ah , yes , i've heard of that contest . ' it was a dark and stormy night . ' yes , lots of fun . anysay , it was fun chatting !"
17376,ha ! can't imagine what it would have beenl ike without romantic kissing since it's a fairly new development and is hardly found in andcient greek literature ! it was great chatting with you as well . take care !
17377,are you into artificial intelligence ?
17378,"not really . it's ibterestig , though . are you ?"
17379,i lofe it . a lot of people are afraid that it may take over and take jos away .
17380,"yeah , people are acraid for sure . personally , i think it could only make the worl dbetter"
17381,it is already making a huge impact on everyday life by helping us do things we do everyday like communicate
17382,no doubt . as time goes by it fcan do many things for us . robof amrers are coming in britain
17383,that will bee xtreemly benefcial to the world . automated cars will be of gr3at value too
17384,i totally agree . huma ndrivers are dangerous ! no more drunk driving . no more texting and driving ! imagine all the lives tha twill be saved .
17385,the car i have now iw essentilly automated
17386,"aweslme ! ai could allow people tof ocus on things yhat a machine could never do . like being creative , for instance"
17387,ai ise ven pre3sent in medicine now days . some surgeries can be donbe wiht the assistance of ai and doctor supervisiom
17388,"a machine will not accidenly leave something i na patient . machines have no empathy ,s o the doctor's role will not go away"
17389,i think you are right . i am curious to see how art and music integrate ai
17390,"yeah , no doubt . ai may assist with the recording of music , replacing the sound engineer maybe . it'll be interesting to see"
17391,many of the large tech exrcutives have degrees n humanitie sznd english and not scienc elike you mivht think
17392,tayt actually does not surprise me . those subjects can help y0u gain insight that engine4ring can't . i think both are imoportant to study
17393,as computer shave advanced so to has ai .
17394,i didn't know that a woman wrote the first algorithm .
17395,pretty amsazing for sure . the space shuttle runs off of a relatively small computer and the russians have one that ruzn on water
17396,"kristen stewart cowrote an paper about ai , i had no idew"
17397,one of the first published papers i believe .
17398,hello . do you know much about ai ?
17399,"not much , terminator taught me to be fearful of ai !"
17400,i am not sure what i think of machines mjmicking human s. makes me nervous !
17401,"a machine learning and problem solving is scary , and they ekep gett9ng smarter ."
17402,i know . honestlky the idea of autonomous ope4ating cars scares me most .
17403,even scarier tha nself driving cars i sthe fact that actress kristen stewart coauthored a paper o nai .

17577,"i gues sits part of a norma lroutine to them , johny depp also likes to wear costumes t0oc heer kids in hospitals"
17578,"that's really sweet when celebrities do stuff like that . depp is not my fav , but i give him credit for that . i also like it when celebs like justin timberlake get so dressed up they aren't recognizalbe and mingle in with normal fol;ks who have no ide athe celeb is there ."
17579,"ives een some sketches , one of maroon 5 they wsere in disguise and started olaying then people realized it was them and the cro3d grew at an accelerated rate"
17580,"it's likec ostumes laly an important role in society . . . as in , thet can be a cultural thing , but also a way to0 connect to others . i think one of my favorite instances of this is when kyrie irving the basketball player dressed up as an old man and went to a public court to play . he schooed everyone and it was really fnhny ."

17585,"i did , i didn't really like it i think she gives a terrible example tot eens"
17586,"yea , 8 remember the ray j thing . i wonder if that was a coordinatd pulbifcity stgunt , or if she just turned it in her favor , or if it was axctually a traumatic thing for her but people ejndee up paying more attention to her anyway ? in any case , th ewhole thing was less than hwolesoms . . ."
17587,"celebrities tend to bring a lor of dranma to our life s, they earjn a lot of money too just like judge judy , she makes about 123000 per episode"
17588,"yesa hes' paid a lot to get into people's faces a bit ! i can't believe she's xecond to lebron james as far as her imcome goes . 9'd ,ike tos ee thrm play1 on1 on the courft though ."
17589,"that would be interestiny indeed , lebron has an unfair advantage though , did yohuh ear about pixafs secret room ?"

17640,"i really don't know , i think it depends on the quality of the teacher sand the dedica6ion of the students . some people say with the right teacher , a mediocre student can really shine , but with some students . . . , shrugs ,"
17641,you do have a point tbere . i've heard that at teachrs have great eputations so far . so your optimism may be justified haha .
17642,"yeah , i beardr one of the courses th4y offered was in computer technology . speaking of computeds , did you know the russiahns amde a conputer tat ran on water '"
17643,"whwy ? really ? that's insane ! but then again i work on designinf uantum comput4rs so i've seen somew eird stuff myself haha . hysics is weird in general , don't you think ?"
17644,"you work on quantu mcomputers ? ? for real ? 5hat is awesome ! but yeah , pysics is pretty weird . i' mtold kim jongum has z degree in physics . i wonder if it's earned or ' honorary ' . . ."
17645,"oh he earned it , just like how he invented basketball ! i wonder if they'll offer any qunatum computing courses through ap or at in the future . do you think highschoolers would like wriging 15 page research papers for that like they do for at already ?"
17646,"depends on the high school student , i guess . i couldn't relaly see writing 15 pages on about anything these days . lol . speaking of physics , they say pixar studied the physics of curly hair for trhee years . can you believe it ?"
17647,"oh i believe it , thqt stuff gets real complicted real fast . solving com0licated partial diferential equations should b4 an olympic sport , just like literature and music once were !"
17648,"ih eard one guy got a degree in theoretical physics when hew as only 20 years old . now , that's gotta be on4e smart fella !"
17649,indeed my dud e. how many ap tests do you think he took ? do you think they'd ever exclude him from at classes like that school in sxarsdaqle does ?
17650,no idea . i have a better question . . . do you think he' dwant to be a transhumanist and upload his brain into a computer ? that would be pretty wild !
17651,i know i would ! hopefully my research can help make that a realitg one day . then i'll uplad your brain tol !
17652,hmm . .d unno if i'd want my brain uploaded . sounds a bit on the creepy side . . . i know we couldn't do it on a space shuttle computer though . it only jas 1mb ofr ram ! can you believe it ?
17653,"crazy how much computers have evolved , huh ? now your smartphone can downlkoad the entie history of western literature and still have space to spare 2"
17654,literature is another neat subject . . did you know there's an annual challenge for writers to com up with the worst possible opening to a novel ? i find tuat hilarious !
17655,that sounds like fun to me haah . do you rhink kissing will ever be phased ou tof literature ? i knowt hat's onl7 a modern thing .
17656,"no , i think it's pretty much here to stay , as long as there' sromance novels m which don't seem to be slowing down anytime soon . ,"
17657,"ah , that's too bad haha . but unlike romancs novels , i can't stay myself . but i had nice chat and i hope you have a nice day . goodvbye !"
17658,did you know thay he fda has burhed six tons of literature in the sake of us censorship ?
17659,do we know what theme had those books ?
17660,8'm not sure . but there is an annual literature contest for literature with the worst opening sentences
17661,"now thats something i would love to see an example of ! ; ,"
17662,nterestingly l the space shuttle's general purpose computer only ran on 1b of rak
17663,to do what . . . keep the txt fioles ?
17664,"i don't jnow , but doesn'ts ound lik3 a lof of memory . in 1936 russians made a compute that ran on water . i wish i could do that if i could save monr7 and recycle thew ater ."
17665,"raj on water . . . was it liek a cyborg jesus ? : ,"
17666,don't dmoke near an apple computer o rit will void the warran5y making it z biohazard
17667,"i don' believ ethat . . .? how would the7 know ? : k,"
17668,maybet he smell ?
17669,"what , when you go to the service depo t, thet can smell if somebody was smoking close to it ? ; ,"
17670,"eojebody made up the rule ,s o there has to be some test : , puxar spent htree years studying physics of curly hair to correclty render merida's hair in ' brave '"
17671,"now that's unteresting . i wonder if that resea5ch hel;ed creating nvidia hairworks technology : ,"
17672,could be ! they think that an acnient chimnese dye used 9on th eterra cotta army may lead to quantum physics breakthroughs . wonder how ?
17673,terra cotta army ? what is tuat ?
17674,i believe that was hte large statue army that was uhncovered in china . you can look it up it is amazing !
17675,what . . . how does this has anything to do with qantum physics . . .
17676,"i have no idea , but the statue army is really really cool looking and a great archaeological find . people think the universe could have come from nothing without violatin gphysucs . don' quite understand that eitehr ."
17677,come from nothing ? in physics nothing comes from nothing . . .
17678,i don't even know what that iumplies nothingg rom nothing . in 1953 sir winston churchill won a nobel priz3e in liyerature not peace
17679,"he fought fo rthe peace : , it's kind of a paradox : , lol , ma7be that's why : ,"
17680,"could be . interestingly architecture , literature , music , painting and xculpture were olympic events from 1912 to 1952 ."
17681,"i love apple products , and was surprised to learn that smoking near them violates the warranty , as it is supspkdedly a ' bio hazard '"
17682,captcha is an acronym for ' completsly automated public turing test to tell computers and humnas apart '
17683,"yes , i knew this . i like 'c aptcha ' better . what do ylu think of those people who want to u;load their minds to computers ?"
17684,i think they are losing their minds . . . ha !
17685,just like the person who built a wo4king computer out of minecraft building blocks . that was weird too .
17686,yeah . he really has something to build on though . l . the first google computer at stanford was housed im custommade enclosures constructed from lgo brikcs
17687,"that's crazy . theb again , the russians made one that ran 0on water , back in 19376"
17688,the firdt computer algorithm was written by a woma nnamed ada lovelace . might not be nominated but they got the algorihm . . .
17689,i recently found outt aht literaqture an dpainting were once olympic events .
17690,i did not know that . . . comedic fantasy author terry pratchett was mnighed for his ' services to literature ' .

17692,wait . . . you've never heard of winston hurchill ? ? ? ?
17693,ter5y pratchett i the one whom i've never heard of . i'm wellversed in the writings of churchill .
17694,whew ! i was going to be a little bugged with the educatij system !
17695,"lol . it's the fda we ave to bde worried about , thdy like to burn literature ."
17696,haha . . . the hubble telescope discovered a galaxy so big that it shouldn't exist according to modenr physics . who knew !
17697,i love looking at the images that the hubble sent gack . it's fascinating that pixar spent three years studying curly hair .
17698,"that's interesting . turbulecne is one of physics great mysteries , and va ngogh could accurately depict it in some of his paintings . i hate it on planesz though . . ."
17699,"i feel the same . van gogh was very interesting . i didn't know that kim jogn u nhas a degree in physics , thats surprising"
17700,from where though ? is it like one of our honorary ones ?
17701,"i dontk now . i don'tk now much abou thim . maybe china , as the terfra cotta army may ead shcolars to a breakthrough in quatnum physics ."
17702,nice chatting with you !
17703,good morning ! how are you ?

17712,"i didn't know that , do you know what he won it for ?"

17717,"it doe s! if i release a book , i'm going to do it in no4way because you're bound to sell at least 1000 copies haha ."

17727,did you know that our own fcda bursn six tons of literature calling it censorship ?
17728,"i heard that ijformation once , but i hnavenb't read much about it ."

17730,"yes it is , how do you get most of your information from sincfe you no longer go to the library , frkom the comphter ?"
17731,i've neve rthought about it but i guess i do . how about you ?
17732,"i get almost all my informtion from the computer , but it is putting a strain on my eyes ."
17733,i know wyat you mean there . books don't put as much a strain as computsers do .
17734,can you imagine being faldely imprisoned for 10 years and spend most of the time at a library trying to prove your innocence ?
17735,no but it is very admirable of teh person to do so .
17736,"you are right , i guess there is no limits whne it comes to being free especially if they are innocnece ."
17737,"hey , what do you think of horses ? an interesting fact baout them is htat those lipizxaner horses are actually born black or rbown and take about 6 years to turn white !"

17753,"alrrady 17 countries hosted the footbal lworld cup , qatar has planned to hosts 2022 finalxs , 0226 will jointly hosted by canada , us and mexico ."
17754,"nice ! hte current champion is france , who won on the 2018 fifa world cup on july 15t h."
17755,avfter 1908 summer olympics in london football became official competitions .
17756,"i didn't know taht . at5 the 2014 world cup , there were more french born players plzying against france than for it ."
17757,i tis very sd . very different to handle tbis situation .
17758,"lol if the algerian team had beaten germany in their last aorld cup game , they would have gone on to play france on teh excac date of the french invasion of algeria's capita, on july 4 , 1830 . ironic ."

17761,yeah . it has record f hiyhest attendance to watch the game .
17762,nice . americans csll i tsoccer because it was slang fo9r association football !
17763,soccer is az tea msport played with a spherical ball between two team of eleveh players .

17767,hello
17768,hi . have you heard the newws in olympics ? its been 114 years since someone ahs won a old medal
17769,"yes sure , do you know ledecka , primarily a snowboarder , who wobt he women's suprg on skis"
17770,"yes and sh eeven competdd in 2 different sportsa lthough most people think that skiing nd snowgboardi8ng are the same , they are quite different"
17771,"here are dozens of athletes who compete in complimentary disciplines of the same spor such as llolo jones ,w hom i like a lot"
17772,ive read that in todays modern times that most athletes simply xant get the time to master two sports so its e3xciting when that happena
17773,"and alo , and historically , national teams used athletes from sports that involved similar skillsets suvch as swimmers who play water polo or pentathletes who are also shoters , swimmers , fencers , runners and equestrians to save money or because teams lacked a depth of talent , do you agree ?"
17774,i agree it is a wise idea to use the same athlete but what about the guy flack that tried to run the marathn an passed out while int he lead
17775,"ye sthat is for ure , there simply isn't enough time in the day f9r modern elite athletes to master two sports . to the layperson , skiing and snowboarding look preyty similar"
17776,"on the topic of sports , did you know that occee makes more money combined than even football and other sports . wow"
17777,ues i know cxause i adore soccer lol . dkd you know oe lydon won a bronxe medal as a welterweight boxer in the 104 st . louis games and a silver medal in soccer .
17778,you like soccer and i like the gymnastics which i thin kis one of the older sports htat even greeks in ancient times przcticed gymnastica to ready fo war . thats interesting
17779,"wow cool , i like gymnastics too . ad do you now anytihing about association football ?"
17780,i know associat9on footall is extremely poppular as if is played in over 200 countries and i know tht american scall it soccer which os slang fof ssociation football
17781,"and also tnere exists a variation of socfer where 3 teams face each other at the sqme time , its very interestihng"
17782,"3 teams , that is unique . the story of a german socder player who won the world fcu0 and paid for 2 3children in brazil to have surgeries is an amazing story ."
17783,yes adn do you love tennis ?
17784,i do like tenis . a fun fact about tennis is that polo shirts were invented because of tennis . a famous player rene lacoste created thm and later wa sadopted by polo players
17785,a black man won the 1st us open tennis title inb 1968 and no black man has won it sinc .
17786,iy hink that wa sarthur ashe if i am not mistaken . i was surprised to ;earn that the longest tennis match in history was over 10 hours long and lasted 3d ays ! i bet those players were tir4ed
17787,ye si agree with you totally
17788,"the game that most of the world calls football , bu the us dallss occer is ppayed on a pitch ."
17789,what do you mean by plays on a pitch ? i do liek association football aka soccer hhaa wnat about you ?
17790,that i swhat the field is called . it is rectangular and has a goal at each end .;
17791,"i se now . i did know htat you sclre by shooting teh ball into the goal . what's crazy to me is that soccer makes more money than football , basketball , tennis , nad all other sports combined"
17792,i know . lots of people ;lay it . ove4r 250 million in the world . i coached it when my daughter was young .
17793,oh that's cool . i used to play when i was a kid . interestihg why americans call it soccer . i guess that's because its slang for association football
17794,we akready had a sport called football . jon stewart actually represented the us in the 0an am games inb razil in 1983 playing soccer
17795,i did know that . did you ever watcu bim in the daily show ? i want to se this variation of soccer that three teams play
17796,"i do enjoy his hujor , but i am a capitalist and not a socialist so i don't agree wit hhim politically . i cannot imagine howa 3 teams playing can make sense ."
17797,i agree with you . i definitely don't like his politics . he was in the movie big daddy with adam sandler and i did like that movie . have you ever played tennis ?
17798,"i have . i had a female neighbor who played club level competition anx she found me , a male , to be a good trainign partner . a seve that is not returned is oen objective of the game ."
17799,yep that'st rue . i used to play when i was in high school . i lie playing with two people which they called doubles
17800,"that is a surprisingly different game . polo shirts were inven6ed for tennis by rene ' the cr0codile ' lacoste . thus , the brand for polo ."
17801,you'd think it would have been invent4ed by a polo palyer . did you know that a nlack man won the first us open title in 1968
17802,no . there haven't been many prominent us players who were male and black . but the williamw sisters have4 sure been something . the tennis ball is hollow .
17803,yes the williams swusters are really good l the black man that won back in 1968 has bee the only one tod o so but i know that we will have more in the futuere
17804,"could be . ika m from oklahoma and barry switzer said that the ebst b;ack athletes that used to poay for5 him now go into basketball instead . so , it will require some black athletes to direct theire fforts toward tennis before they win a lot . i hope tos ee it ."
17805,that makes sense . pretty crazy that they use the helicopter to dry grass tennis courts bwck in 1969 . i bet the us open was a reeally crazy place back then
17806,how about a match hat laated 11 hours and was spread over 3 days ?
17807,yep that would be exhausying ! i wouldf eel so bad for the guy that lost . so much effort for so littler eward
17808,great point ! i have seen s cricket match last for 8 hours . nice chat !
17809,hey did you see that originally croatia was going to he the runner up to the world cup ?
17810,"yeah , i di d. do you watch much soccer ?"
17811,"no not usually , i probably won't watch the 2022 world cup in qatar , what about you ?"
17812,me either . lol but i enjoy watching the fan's behaviors l they can get pretty wild about their soccer .
17813,"ya they really get into it , it is cool that the usa got third place in the 1930 world cup , bak when they were good haha"
17814,"yeah , that's cool . i find it funny that were more french born players playing against france than for it in the 2014 world cup ."
17815,"ha that is funny , did you hear about how awesome hungary i sat soccer ? they had only 1 defeat back between 1950 and 1956"
17816,that's pretty impressive !
17817,"the usa womens soccer team is impressive too , they haven't placed below 3rd since 1991"
17818,go usa ! awexome ladies . have you ever seen the type of soccer that pits three teams againste ach other at the same time ?
17819,"no i haven't but ib et it would be more interesting than regular soccer , its amazing that soccer ix played by 250 million people worldwide"
17820,"lol , i know ! you know when you asked me if i woudl be watching the 2022 wrld cup , did you realize that city wher eit will beh eld gas not eve nbeen built yet ?"
17821,"lol nope but thats not a good sign , i can't believe that soccer makds more money than all other sports combine d ,thqts a ton of money"
17822,i tis a pile of money . i heard that jon stewart was a pretty goo soccer player in college .
17823,"ya he was , he actually represented thw us in the pan american games back n 1983"
17824,did you hear about the german soccer player who donated his bons he got for winning the world cup to pay for 23 kids surgeries in brazil ?
17825,"wow that was nice of him !b ack to qatar , i wonder why they are building the city for that game , apparently no country gets a nete conomic icnrease fro, hosting the world cup"
17826,"proabbly some rich oil tycoo nwants to brag about his city hosting the world cup ? whok nows hwy they do what they do , htey have more money than they know what to do with , apparently ."
17827,yeah it sounds lile it . did you ever hear why americans called gfame soccer and not foobtall ? apparently the word soccer is slang for association football
17828,leave it up to americans ! what can i say we like our slang words .
17829,"haa ya we do , it's interesting how world wars can mess with sports , they didn't do a world cup in 1942 or 1946 due to wwi"
17830,"hi , how are you ?"
17831,"good , how are you ? do you watch soccer ?"

17837,not 6oo bad bu5 did not win either . the us women's team is good yhough
17838,yeah . they arw the only thing we have to look forward to i soccer . it's the whole system tuhat needs revamping .
17839,yesh for sure . ane the host countries never make any money for hosting the wordl cup
17840,seems like a bad investment then . do you tnnk qater sho9ld host the 2022 world cup ?
17841,i am not asure considering the city hosting doex not exist yet
17842,right ? how can fifa approve that ? seems sghadh . . .

17861,"yes , i know 8 years agoa t wimbledon , john isner and nicolas mahut played the longest ever tennis mafch in hiwtory . the match went on for thbree days and took place over 11 hours and 5 minutes with isher coming out victorious 106 in the fnal set ."
17862,"that's pretty crazy , wonder if they had to use a ehlicopter to dry the grass like they did in the 1968 us open"
17863,i dn't know .
17864,"do you follow soiccer at all , it makes more money rhan football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis , and hockey combied"
17865,i love tennis and basket bal lgames .
17866,nice . there's a varition of socc4r with 3 team sfacing off against eac hother
17867,yes . adn i also love gymnastics . it's relaly beautiful . they are awesome .
17868,"gymnastics is fun to watch , one olympic gymnast won 6 medals with a wooden leg in 1904"
17869,"y6eah , i kno . it was awesome . 8g was george louis eyser and was a germanamerican gymnast ."
17870,nics . the first person to score a perfect 10 waa nadia comaneci fro mromania
17871,fiest woman to score a perfect 10 in an olympic gymnastics event at the 1976 olgmpic games at age 14 .
17872,"well i got to go , njice chattign wiht you"
17873,do you watch the world cup ?
17874,yes i saw it alongw ith the 3 . 2 billion other people around the world who wathed it as well . did you see it ?
17875,"yeah , i like soccer , a lot of people do , even jon stewaft was a really good soccer player ."
17876,"jo nstewart , the comedian ? yeah , do you know where the next wordl cup will be played ?"
17877,"it will be in qatar , i think , they have to build a lot of infrastructure to accommodate i t."
17878,"yeah , i im,agine there woiuld also have to be a lot of ac since it can get very very hot in those cdlimayes !"
17879,"and a lot of power plants have to be build , they have to build a city wheret he final wil lbe hosted . i think kt is a little too much money ."
17880,"i wonder if these invstments everr eturn a positive cash flow , to me it just doesn' tseem like it's possible at all . i'd also imagine tehy' dhave to loosen up on visa restriction sto get more visitors ."
17881,"yeah i xon't think they are like the german pla6ee who tave his world cup victory bonus to brzilian children , who nbeeded surteries ."
17882,"taht's quite commendable , a lot of the other players should follow suit ! but considering that soccer players ru nan average of 7 miles per game , they migjt bge too rired to thin, rationally ."
17883,"there is also a variation of soccer with 3 teams , they would run even more . i wonder what rules they have for 8t ."
17884,"wow , they must be in great shap4 ! all except for the people in greenland whoc an't join fifa because not enough grass grows thered fo rsoccer fields . that doesn't mean players can't play right ?"
17885,"they could play on astroturf . they probably do , it is a popular slort ."
17886,"yeah but even eith playing on turf , they still won't bea ble to join the leasbues . surprising to see size and scale of super bowl relative to soccer , super bowl is only na americant hing while soccer is global , i gues s."
17887,"i think it comes to a question of equipment , you only need a ball and 2 goa lfo4 soccer ."
17888,"i see . then there's logos anc mascots , the frnch national team uses a rooster because erooster in latin is similar to the name jsed forg aul or the curr4nt day france , who knew there's me3anin behind these thimgs ."
17889,"footabll , is full of details , american ca.l it soccer because it comes from associatuion football"
17890,"that's a very good one ! tehn there'e the colors of jerseys . the french team did a bad job of coprdinating the team jersey na dthey found it was the same color as their opponenrs , so they had to borrow a different color jersey from a local team . that's hikarious , 5hey should've played as is , that would've made an entertainig gam eto watch ."
17891,"yeah , instead of a gmae with 2 teams , there would hav ebeen only 1 , everybody is a winner ! . . .a nd a losedr ."
17892,do people place bets on the outcome of those games ?
17893,"i don't know anything about betting of soccer matches . but is uppose so , it is played in2 00 countries . some of them must permit b3etting on matcues ."
17894,"yeah , i think thatm ight be the nex tbig thin g!"
17895,"hello there , are you a fan of football , or soccer as they all it in the us ?"
17896,yes ! i am one of 250 million people in world who play soccer haha
17897,"yeah same here , i don't know why we call it soccer here in the estaqtes , do you know why they started calling it that ?"
17898,"i think it's something to do with it being a slang name for association football . did you know that soccer makes more money than football , basketball , baseball , gklf , tennis , and hockey combined ;"
17899,"yep , good all , started as a slang term f9r association football . and that is prett5y remarkable , i like when people here say it's not a popular sprt ."
17900,they should tleevise the variation of soccer where there are 3 reams that face off at the sme tme . maybe they would get more spectators in the us
17901,"that sounds too crazy , i wonder if they used the same size field or not ."
17902,"it's hard to believe that jon stewar twas a really skilled soccer layer . hea ctuza,ly represented the us at 5he pa namerican games in rbazil . i guess for him there was more money in comedy ."
17903,"that is pretty imprsssive , i never knew htat and don't thknk most people have ."
17904,ar eyou into any other sports ?
17905,"i am , i really like basketball and my favorite team hast he best record in the league riht now ! hw about you ?"
17906,"i really enjoy watching tennis . although when i play it the object for me is more to just get the ball over the net than to return it in such a way that my opponetn is not able to return it haha it is definitely ahrdsr than it ,ooks !"
17907,"yeah it really is , that spor ttakes a lot of skill and endurance to play that's for sure ."
17908,"i enjoy watchung roger federer , he is such a talented player . well , except for the ti,e he lost to gael monfils who had just learned to play tennis a few days before hteir match ."
17909,"5eally , i'm sure that was the thrill of a lifetime for that person to beat him !"
17910,i'm sure ! i would rather be known as the guy who beat roger federer han one lf the players in the longes ttennis match in history . it went on for 11 houts ! can yu iamgine how exhausted the athletes would have been after tha t!
17911,"that i just insane , i woneer how many pe0plef rom the 0riginal crowd that started hte matc hwer still there to watch thee nd ."
17912,"i know , right ? that would take some serious commitment ! it spanned over 3 days ."
17913,"right , i wonder if they got back into the place free ezch day ?"
17914,i would hope so ! i am juist so impressed by the athleticism . and you her about olympica thletes like edwin black who wr eable to win a bronz4e medal in the olympics for tennis dpoubles and gold medals in 800 and 1500 meter races . i would be so excite if i was that talented at one sport le talone two !
17915,"that is the most impressive thing i have hear din a while . ot was nice talkjing with you , i hope you have a ood day ."
17916,"hell , do you lik3 rogs ?"
17917,theyh have their moments . i apprsciate that they are one of knly two ajima;s able t instinctively understand pointing .
17918,thats interesting . i r5ecently read that dogs hzve 12 different blood types .
17919,"that's a lot , more than humsn 1q did you know that dogs aren't actually colorlbind ? they just can't see ad as kany colors as peoplse ."
17920,"yeah , thats good to know . i used to think that they werec olorblind ."
17921,"i guess color isn't as important whn you can do so many different tasks , from bunrtin gand herding to aiding drisalbed peopel ."
17922,"yeah , it probably is not a need for them ."
17923,thy certainly are man's bet friend . googlee fven has a policy that states that they are a dog company .
17924,"i agree , i lovem y dog , i dow ish she would laugh at my jokes once in awhile though lol thats really xcool abou google !"
17925,"i guess a laughing dog wuld be a good comanion . in boulder , co , people don't even ' own ' their pets because oif that ida of the relationship ; you'5e just thei r' guardian ?"
17926,"oh wow , that interesting , i never kenw that . in ikstanbuyl they have vending mqcuhines the release food and water for strays , in exchange for recycled plasti cbottles ."
17927,"that's a neat idea . it woul dcome in useful in a countrdy likej apan , where there are moire p3ts than children undsr 15 ."
17928,wow that is incredible ! they have that amnt dogs ! yeah that would eb pretty useful !
17929,"i think they probably have more cats than dogs , given the land limitations there haha . you know who had a lot of pets ? teddy roosevelt ; he had over 20 , including a bear and a hyena ."
17930,"thats crazy ! i'm sure he had help though , for an average american that is a lot of work . i read that the first cat cloned was named copy cat lol"
17931,that's clever . maybe they can clone tigers to increade their numbers ; there are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia !
17932,"wow that is really sa d. they should lcone all the endangered species , migth need ab igger lab fr larger animals like sharks lol"
17933,"i'm not sure how practical that would be , since it'?s so hard to track those plpulations anyway to figyre out if they need new members ."
17934,"well the discoery channel is always makin gshowsa bout endangered animals , sot hey could start there . i know sharls are endnagered abd a few tpes of beas ."
17935,i think in the mean time it's important to raise prope4r herapy animals ; it seems like some people just claim regular pets are therapy animals . maybe that could be a discovery chanenl show !
17936,"yeah seriously , people take advantage of that just so their regular pets cna go to restaurants and stuff . its kind of annoying kt hey claim its a ' support ' dog ."
17937,"yes , i think children in hospitals and elderly folks in nursing homes need the company more to lift their spirits and work on tehie goals . nice chatting !"
17938,"i love oldendoodles , i have one myself . she's only forty poundsn ot eighty like lord sandwich ."
17939,"i think lord sandwich is a funny name lol , they stqrted a winery back in 2014 ight ?"
17940,"i do like that name as well . i wish that my dog had an unusual nmae like his . i would hav eput my dog on the label from the beginning . yes , they did open in 2014 ."
17941,"you cah still chang its name lol it would be confused but eventyally will answer to the name , its amazing how they raised 25000 inj ust 30 days"
17942,"i think it would be more conf7sing for em after six years ! if you have a nkce , unique product an dthe proper rewards , you can get a lot of funding through kickstafter ."
17943,"i agree , its a good way to fund your company , its amazing how many fplloweds lor dsandwich has on instragram 65k ! !"
17944,"do you follkow any animals pn instagram ? i have to admit that i do , i might have to look up lord sandwihc ."
17945,"i dont but i might make an exeption for lorr sandwich , im curious to meet the little guy ,"
17946,80 poundsa nd as tall as doorknob smakes me think eh isn't so little . i wonder if they made a whi5te wine for him based on his fur color ?
17947,"i think they took that into account , ykou know they are planning to release a wienw ith his naewm inh it , it will be a white wine production"
17948,are you a big wine drinker ? i am not but i might make an excedption for this one .
17949,"i do like win e, and i might look up some of thd wines the company has to offer , they have a germanh region based wine that6 has a price of 20 so i might try that one"
17950,i do like to try elss expensive wines because i don ot know the difference as much between vintages . i do not know if i have tried amny wines from the german region .
17951,"yeaj i dont know much about wine either i do like the taste of pinot noir , i think its interesting how they ar eplanning to make wines from regions such as austria and loirey valley"
17952,its definiteloy great to explore the different regions . it could open their client bas up immensely and help people find new winest hey might not have known about .
17953,"i think its a good businss decision , you got to keep things fresh anhd updated ,s o do you have ny pets ?"
17954,i only have thye one goldendoodle . i often watch my sister's dog so jit feels as if i have two dogs al ot of thw time .
17955,"thats nice , so im guessing your more of a dog person that a cat person ?"
17956,"yes , i have an allergy to cat haor so i was kknd of forced into it . i don't otherwise mind them in small doses ."
17957,i am more of a dog person and so i google l they prefer dogs to cats and they have mad ethis clear
17958,i think that in an office sdetting dogs ar wa bit more sociabel and appropriate than cats . cats tedn to be very self sufficient and isolated .
17959,"yea i agree with you dogs and cats are the most popular pets , you know roosevelt had over 20 pets , he had a bear and also a hyena as pets ."
17960,xid you hear about the goldendoodle hwo helped t creat a wine brad ?
17961,i did ! seems they took asvantage of our love of pets am dsocial media be build the following !
17962,"they certainly did ! it's cool that they raised 25 , 000 in 30 days , just beczuse of teh theme ' farmers first '"
17963,"we l,ove dogs and have 2 . ghey aren't golden doodles but we got rhem from a rescue group . they haven't ever donatd bloof because tey are small but apparently they could because there are 12 different blood typs instead of the 3 human types ."
17964,that is interesting . i didn't know there were that many dog blood types . i hope that t6h4 dogs get a treat after the blood drive thouh .
17965,"they should ! i guessw e re google type of people sknce they prefer dogs to cats . i do like cats , but i'm really allergic to them . : ,"
17966,"yep i'm glad that google prefers dogs to cats lol . i am allergic to them too but i do like the . i think iy's crazy that only dogs can elephants understand pointing , not eve gorillas which you think would be very smart"
17967,"hmm . it does seem weird that other primates don't get po8nt9ing . i have a dog that loves a yellow ball and she ignores the other colored balls . i guess yellow must eb one of the colors they can see . i know they don't see all the ones we do , but she must aee htat one !"
17968,"i agree wiht you ! i'm just glad rhat dogs are not actually colorblind , they just see different colors from us , poor doggos !"
17969,i like that istnabvul exchanges used water bottles for water and food for stray dogs ! htings like thzt would help the rescue group we got our dogs from .
17970,i think that's a really good use of strayd ogs htough . it's very smart . do you wear socks by the way ?
17971,"i'm wearing two pairs now , because it is really co,ld today ! but i don't like wool socks because they ar escratchy , to me ."
17972,yep i agree l it's funny that the oldest known socks were xsupposed to be wonr with sandals and that is definitely not what is in fahsion now lol
17973,rivht ! the old socks wnd flip flops are not a good combo ! i think its' funny that 'purt a sock in it' com4es from the habit 9f stuffing a sock in the old phonograph so it's woupdn't be so loud .
17974,yep i agre e. ut's funny that the inventor of the modern sock also produced the first modern water balloph . i wonder what he was thinking about
17975,i don't know but my kids qre sure happy . they love to throw water balloons in the summer ! have you ever thought to donates ocks to a homeless syelter ? semes that is an ite mthey really need butd on't often get .
17976,"no i haven't done that , but i guess i should . i think it's funny that the phrase ' put a sock in it ' was invented 1800s lol"
17977,"since it's c0ld today , maybe i should try putting chili peppers in my socks to keep my feet warm , like the portuguease . i guess they cut th4m up first ?"
17978,lol that' a go0od quedtion . it sounds liek it would hurt though . you have any pets ?
17979,"i already mntioned that i have 2 dogs , several times ! i'ts funny that in colorado you have o sy you are a pets 'gurdian' and not that you own them !"
17980,"yep you're right , i was only payihg attentioon to myself because i havs a husky lol . it' sweird that the first cloned cat was named copycat though ."
17981,are you familiar with fifa world cup ?
17982,i am a little fmailar with it . i thonk i havew qtdched a few tams on television . do you watch ?
17983,i watche dthem in the past since y good friend is from england . the currnet champioon is francr .
17984,i rememer watching af e of those games that were i nrussia on televisio n .i woud have thught russia would benefit economically from hosting but apparrently hosting cpountries don'ft get any financial boosts .
17985,i was surprised to hear about it . i think it has to do with pride more than anything else .
17986,you are provbably right . i kean qatar is building a whole new city just to host te 2022 games .
17987,"most of the hosts have tons of money to apare . qatar ies going to hot in 2022 , is that correct ?"
17988,"that is correct . you knos , the media sayss occee is not all th epopular in the u . s . but it gof 3rd place in the rirst world cup in 1930 !"
17989,i know . that was not bzd for a new comer .
17990,"true ! i suppose they are not as good asz atgentina or have the worlds beet player , mesxi , on tehir team ."
17991,messi is very good at soccer .h e was almos tallowed to leave the club for free 10 years ago .
17992,i think it'sc ool and alseo odd that no one in his hoemtown can name a kkid messi anymore .
17993,i did not kno wthat ? please tell me the reason why .
17994,out of respectf orh im . they want him to be teh only one .
17995,i wonder if there is an official ordinance for that . it's weird .
17996,i imagine thjere is as that would just ad dto the respecft they have for him . did you know tyat there is a soccer game where 3 teams face each other ?
17997,no i did not . please tell me more abut it .
17998,apparejtly each team faces each other at tbe swme time ! this i would like to see bgut i tmust not be very popular as main stream media does not talk about it or show it .
17999,that was interesting 3 teajms facing ech other .
18000,i know . i cna only imagine how that must be plzayed .
18001,"it would be chaotic , i think . i keep saying soccer instead of football because it is what bwing called in the us ?"
18002,do you l8ik soccer ? th efirst worldc up was in 1930
18003,"hello , i do like soccer . did yoyu knpw nrew zealand was the only undefeated team in the 2010 world cup ?"
18004,american womens team has never placed below third in the world cup
18005,that;s interesting . i qlways thoght htey were good too .
18006,the city thats set for the 2022 world cup doesnt even exist yet . are they bui;ding an entire city ? ?
18007,that's hilarious ! i wonde how that is toing to work out .
18008,"i dont know . lol . soccer makes more money than football , basketball , golf , tennis wand hockey combine d. i can't believe that"
18009,tha'ts amazing . i would have never guessed that . there was only 1 group in world cup history to end with a 4way tie .
18010,there is a variation of soccer where 3 teams face off at the same time . how in the world does that work ? and where is it played ?
18011,that wold be very fun to watch . i am not sure where it's played .
18012,"a german soccer player used his world cup earnijgs to pa7 for surgeries for 23 children , now why don't more players do stuf flike that instead of wasting all the money on frivolous things ?"
18013,very cool aned gopd for him . i love hearing stories like that . it melts my heart .
18014,mine too . there are no economic gains dor the countries that host world cp or olympic games . j cant se ehow thst is true all of the people flockin gto your city must be god for business
18015,i cind that interesting becauee i always thought it helped their economy . did you know greneladn can't joun fifa because not enough rass rows there for a soccer field ?
18016,hahha its funny ebcause its greenland . i wonder why they dotn lay sod ? or maybe its just too old
18017,haha i heard greenland is actually all ice and cold and that iceland is actually warmer and green .
18018,"yes thats exactly right . the wor,d cup was not held in 1942 or 46 because of ww2"
18019,did nkt know that . the super bowl is smaller than soccer's third biggest event .
18020,how is that even possible and where does it take place ? certainl not in america .

18071,no but i know that it valculate straffic by the speed of android devices moving down the road . i think that is interesting .
18072,"it doe , ive always wondered how they did that , i guess mystery solved , its amazing how much power a single google search requires ."
18073,ive read that a single search takes more clmputing than i took to send emn to the moon . thats har dto believe .
18074,"i know right ? technology surely has advanced a lot , kinx of kike iphones , ive bee nloyal to the brand since the first generation iphone was released back in 2007"
18075,did you know tha tmicrosoft held a funeral fort he death of iphone when it launched its fversjon of the phone ?
18076,"i did not know that how interestign , i wonder who went to the funeral !"
18077,good queston . probably a marketing idea . i heard of a game called send m to heaven that was created to have people throw thei phones in the air and break them
18078,"that gamr doenst seme fun to play , i thinko that the game got banned because it was actually more poplar in thee nd ."
18079,apple banned the game because it was encouragin gusees to engage in behavior hat might damage the device .
18080,"i think that was a go9od dedision , you know theres a stat and womab are more lioely to have an iphon ethan mwn ."
18081,that is an interestng stazt . are tere any ideqs as to why this is true . i alszo heard that mat bellamy used an ihobe to record his unborn childs heartbeat .
18082,"im not sure maybe because of the desig , you know theres more tahn 2 . 2 million appsa vailable for the iphone now"
18083,thats a lot of apps . the iphone has come along wagy as to what it can be used for . so man uses its amazing .
18084,i know 2 . 2 mjllion apps its a lot and that was in 2017 i bet there a lot more new apps now
18085,im sure you're right probably mnay more apps for different uses by now .
18086,"yeah , so do you play any instruents , ive always liked the sound of the guitar ."
18087,i fo play guitar i enjo0y listening to pink floyds guitarist .
18088,"i ehjoy pink floyd as well ., he turjef a boat into a floatin gstudio , how co0ol !"

18092,no i dont who is he .
18093,he is a civil riughts protester from georgia . he is now a rep . he marched with king andw as invovled with the police brutality in birmingham .
18094,rwally . he sounds like a pretty stajd up guy .
18095,yesah . trump went after him on twitter last year saying he never stood up for anything . witter waaq uick to suhow the police dogs tearing his flesh . . .
18096,"ewow , this is the first im hearin of any of this . gu3ess trump astuck his foot in his mouth there huh ."
18097,yeah . it was baffling that he either had nho idea or just didn't csare . i was both horrified and watching gleefully .
18098,i dont understand . you were wathcing gkeefully as police dogs attakced somebody .
18099,nbo ! ! ! watchin gtrump getting blasted on twitter . sorry for the confusion ? that's not something i really want to get mixed up . sorry about that .
18100,its ok . i kind of figured what you meant by it . lol .
18101,the whol;e john lewis icnident befame known as bloody sunday . i cannot imagine what they hadt o go through .
18102,"me either . it makes me feel a little guilty being a white man today . i know that im no racist andn one of my family is , but thet hings black had to to through back then is horrifying ."
18103,"agreed with all of that . let's lighten this up a little , shall we ? mybe they coul dwrite a comic series about fixing all of the collateral damage us white guysd id like marvel did ."
18104,htat would be swesome . me and my son watch supeerherp movies all the tume . cant hurt to have one mor to watch .
18105,htat sounds fun . jmys on is 7 and a litle scared still . there are over 300 registered superheros .
18106,maybe he would enjoy the garfield spinoff where garfield and the gang were all superheroes .
18107,is his mortal enemy heart burn frim all that lasagna ? or would it be his krytonite ?
18108,lol . im definitely gonna have to check that one out now .
18109,nice chatting with you !
18110,good evening ! guess how google maps calculates traffic ?
18111,hey ! i'd eb interested to learh how traffic is calculated
18112,"they go by hte gps devices ina ndrod phones , which is data they have access to . they track how fast the phones are moving along hte road ."
18113,"oh wow , that is interesting and totally makes sense ! i've reasd they used to usel ive goat sto ? mow ' htere lawn . . google uses resources well huh !"
18114,"yes , they once used 100 live goats . only once . i wonder why it didn't continue ."
18115,"i'm imagining 10 0live goatz around the headquarters lol , probably chaos !"
18116,"yes . i wonder why thsy didn't use sheep instead , adn how ,uch work was involved in cleaning up after the goats ."
18117,probably a lot of cleanup . i cant imagine it was more cos effecive tha nhiring a landscaping company .
18118,"yes , but i thin kit would have made it a more fun place to work ."
18119,"hav eto keep the orkplace interesting ! like microsof , holding a funeral for th4 ' death of the iphone ' when their line of phnes was launcehd ."
18120,yes . have you heard of the ' send me to heaven ' iphone game ? i wonde5 if microsof twas bwhind it .
18121,"yes , i've read about that and that woiuld make sense of microsoft doing somethin glike that . so silly"
18122,the creator's stated goal was to shatter qs many iphones as possible . j reqally wonder if it was someokne witg a financial stake in things or just a person hwo doesn't like iphones .
18123,that would have to be a really big hatred for iphones .
18124,yeah . i can't believe it mad3 it to the app store .
18125,i was surprised to learn that women are more likely to own a niphone than men .
18126,"yes , it's interesting . i wodmer what the reasomns are ."
18127,"i see jusy a smany men as i do woman , walking around with 5heir noses stuck in their phone these days !"
18128,yes ! i don't tend to notice whether people's phones are iphones or androids . did you know that the app store fo rios has 2 . 2 million appw ?
18129,"oh wow , that is a huge number . i wodner how useful half of those apps are ."
18130,yes . i wonde r. it's been gokd to talk go you .h ave a good night !
18131,"hi there , do you use googl eor another search engine ?"
18132,hi ! i love google ! i use it everyday
18133,"nice , me too . apparently to do a search though there is more computin gpower reauired than it took to dsend 12 astronauts to the moon"
18134,"on august 16th 2013 , google went down for about 5 minutes and t0ok 4o percetn o fthe web traffi cwith it . interesting , gecause that tells u show many people actually use google ."
18135,yeah i think most people use it exclusively . do you know how they calculate traffic ?
18136,i'm not sure . do you ?
18137,yeah they take the average of android devices that are moving on traffic
18138,il ike the fact htat yiu can typea n address into googl eand it will take you to google maps . that always comes i nhandy .
18139,yeah it sure is . do you know when it was founded and by whom ?
18140,i do not . do youk now ?
18141,yeah it was ladry page and sergey brin in 1998 .
18142,do you know what google's unofficial sloganw as ?
18143,i did not know they had one bu ti am not sure what it is . do you know ?
18144,' don't be evil '
18145,"oh wow , did not expec tit to eb that . once they hired goats instead of gegting people to mow their lawns"
18146,yes that is pretty interestin g! do you know how google maps calculate traffic ?
18147,yeah they gake the average of android cevjices as they move around int raffic
18148,cloud storage comes in handy when you have too many files on your phone .
18149,that has become a life saver honestly . do you have an ipone o 5android ?
18150,i ahve an android . iphones seem really complicated to me .
18151,"well , it seems women are more likely to get one tahn men"
18152,really ? i had no idea .
18153,yeah someone must haved ohe a study on that to find such stats .
18154,hi ther e !looking vorward to chat with you !
18155,"good evening ! jut got back on a quasidate night with my wife . it wasn't much , but we dropped a kid off for practce zan ddrove around a bit ."
18156,quasidate ? what's that ?
18157,"quasi is sort of like ' partly . ' so i twasn't a planned date night , though i know it ks importantf or couples and paren6s ."
18158,"sounds cool : , wht is your kid practicing ? : ,"
18159,she is a soccer player doing futsal this winter . it worked pretty well because our older kids could watch those at home while we had an hour to ourselves .
18160,"good prioritizing : , does she like soccer ? or she goes there coz she has t0o ? ; 0"
18161,she definitely likes it . the only tying she doesn't like is doing drills by herself at home . i think things like i;hones and google just make it easy to be distraced .
18162,"yes those are true enemies of sportw hen it comes to kids : ,"
18163,do you have an i;hone ?
18164,"i have huawei ; , anfroid phone : , you ?"
18165,"mine is a samsung , but i think they ard all so similar . plus , i am a guy , and i guess woman are more likely to own iphones . : ,"
18166,"i didn't want to believe taht , but lal the wom4n i talked about thi subject had also iphones : , so i guess that's true : ,"
18167,they apparently haven't downloaded the game ' send me to heaven . ' the goal of that is to see how high you can flin gyour iphones as th3 creator of the game said he hoped it would lead to th ephones shattering .
18168,"lol . . . sounds like a game for dmmie s: ,"
18169,ouch . . . lol . might be harder to get as aspple banned it from their ap0 store .
18170,"ok , if i woule be game creator i would sue ! if somebody wants the gmae he or she shpuld be bale to get it ; , and apple should love the game people would keep buying new phonesx : ,"
18171,that's a good point . i ma not a huge fan of the product . ' iphone ' is not something i spend my time on google lookin gup .
18172,naah . . i gave up on apple long time ago . i'll buy anything but that . . .
18173,"that sounds ;like me . while iphone users can't live without their phones , most of hte world can't do without google . in 2013 , google went down for five minutes and took a little less than half of web traffic with it !"
18174,"wow . . thoseg uys reallyn eed to be watching what their are doing ; ,"
18175,"well , i n3ed to sign off . i need to check google on a few things before bed anyway ."
18176,ahve you everh eard of john lewis ?
18177,"np , i haven't heqrd of him . what i she famous for ?"
18178,he was famous for marching alng with 600 others from selma yo montgomery to deemand their voting righg s.
18179,was he working with martin luther king ?
18180,"i think he was , instead of eing arrested they were badly beaten by the alabama law enforcement officers ."
18181,that sounds like alabama . was the marc ha success ? did it change political perception ?
18182,"yes , it was a pivotal moment in hte civil rights movement ."
18183,what did lewis go on to do after that ?
18184,"who wr4ote a graphic novel trilogy titled ' march , ' depicting the event ."
18185,that's a great way to tell history . grapyic novels are a good way to get people interested . history comes alve ;
18186,"yeah , soem peopel view him as a superhero ."
18187,perhaps he could become one of the more than 300 registered superheroes in the us .
18188,that's a lot of superheroes . it's hard fro mw to think htat they can come up wiht so many different super power s.
18189,"i wonder if they jus get together , drink and smoke , and spitball ideas until som4thing seems good . there is a superhyero called ' normalman . ' he was the only person without uperpoweers on a planet full of superheroes ."
18190,"htat's funny , never heard of that one , but i definitely coudl elate to him ."
18191,"in a universe of supedheroes , you would be unusula . did you know that there is a theory taht there is only one electron in the universe ? stfange ."
18192,"no i didn't , there's another theory that the universe might be a giant super hologram ."
18193,that sounds more reasonable . everything is the matrix and we're just here to entertain a b7unhc of robots . or superheroes .
18194,"yeah , one giant video game ."
18195,and i would be normalman . not a robot . not a superhero .
18196,"yeah , me too !"
18197,hey there partner . are you a soccer fan ? then ext world cup is going to be in 2022 in qatar .
18198,i am a soccer fan and watch th eworld cup ever 4 years !
18199,nice me too ! it's been around since 1930 but i feel like it's only grown in popularity since then .
18200,yes ! zew zealand was teh only undefeated tezam in the 2010 world cup .
18201,well that is really awesome . in the first ever world cup the united state sgot third place . not bad for the first everw orld cup .
18202,not bad at all . there was only 1 group in world cup history to edn with a 4 way tie .
18203,i'm surprised they ixdn't break that tie ! the hungary national football team only had oner defeat between 1950 and 1956 and tha twas the wolrd cup final !
18204,that's pretty incredilbe . soccer players run an average of 7 miles pe rgame !
18205,no wolnder they are in such incredible shape . the fifa world cup was n0t hedl in 1942 in 196 due to tue second world war . very sad .
18206,yes . sad indeed . 3 . 2 hillion people watched the 2010f ifa world cup !
18207,"that is truly amazing . soccer is so popular and it makes more money than football , basketball , baseball , volf , tennis , and hockey combined !"
18208,isn't that incredible ? greenlbad can't join fira because not enough grass grows theref or a soccer field !
18209,it is so funny because there is a green in th ename yet they can't grow green grass . i kinmd of feel bad for them lol . there's actually a variation of soccer were three teams facew each other at the same time . i would like to see thst .
18210,i wonder how thaft works ; sounds liek it could get condusing being on the filed at th3 same time .
18211,yeah it would be very confusing to m3 . the talkshow host john stewart was a skilled soccer player in cllege and eh even represented the us at the panamerican games n brazil .
18212,i didn't realize he was that old . i don't think i rmember him until the 1990s .
18213,yezh he is much older than it hought . he looks pretty young for his age . one of the best players in the world is leo messi . he i sso fu nto watch .
18214,yes . he is valued at 120 million euro ! big money6 !
18215,big money indeed ! he has a growth hormone deficiency that led him to play soccer in spain ! pretty cool ! and it was lovely speaking with you about mqny things today !
18216,that's nuts ! lolt he first contract given to messi was written on w paper napkin ! i had a good time chatting !
18217,bye !
18218,hi how are you ? do you liek soccer ?
18219,i do not play soccer but i watch soccer games from time to time . my bss immigrated to the us from england . he invites us often to watch soccer games at his house .
18220,thzt is kind of him . it ry to watch the world cup . that is a spectacle worth watchng .
18221,"i know , right . soccer fnas appear to be more fanatic than us football fans . fifa world cup is a big deal ."
18222,"yes , it is a hugely popular sport everywhere . except the us . americans usualy dont unrerstand hpw popular ."
18223,"3 . 2 billion people watcehd the 2010 fifa world cup , 4y . 4 p3ercent of global populatio n, ."
18224,"yes , i believe it . they want to see their own country , wnd to see the sport played at teh highest level . it is amazing to watch ."
18225,"if is . apparently , new zelaand was the onmly undefeated soccer team in the 2010 worl dcup ."
18226,really ? that is amazing . i woudl not have guessed new zealad .
18227,it was wurprisinjg to me too . have you heard about japan's 2021 world cup ?
18228,"no , i have not . they have rugby in 2019 k oympics in2 020 ."
18229,japan is going to project 3rd holograms of the games live onto soccer fields across the world .
18230,that is pretty cool . i wonder how much that will cost . i would love to watch .
18231,i don't know . millions ?
18232,"yeah , i bet . they will sell plenty6 of tickets . they can project it onto m7ltiple fields at the same time ."
18233,do you hav emore interesting facts abo7t soccwr ?
18234,"um , there is a variant of soccer taht involves three teams playing each other ? i dont know how it works though ."
18235,i heard about it but i myself do not really understand ho wit works .
18236,"the rules must be complicat6ed . free kicks ? out of boundsx ? hm . anyway , nice chat !"
18237,i look forward to seeing nextf ifa world cup . nice chatting with you .
18238,you too ! have a good weekend !
18239,thank you . have a good night .
18240,i find planets very in5eresting . how about you ?
18241,i do ! ived been listening to a podcast about the universe !
18242,i'ms ure thats' a good listen . did you know that one of jupiter's moons would be cosnidered a pkanet if it orbited the sun ?
18243,"yeah , ganymede . it has several moons ."
18244,gest hat's te one . did you also know that venus ha sno seasons ?
18245,"yes , because it doesnt tilt o nits axis . des;ite being secon from the sun it is the hottest planetc ue to its atmoephere ."
18246,that's very interesting . venus is also the only planet that rotates clockwise .
18247,"i guess that is tru e, i never thought about which way we rotated , but i guess sunrise and set give that away ."
18248,that's true . did you also know that uranus rotatess ideways ?
18249,like it rolls ? how does that affect seasons ?
18250,yes it rolls around the sun rather hna spinning like other planets . i do not know how that affects it's seaaons bu i'm cu4rious to find out .
18251,do tou believe there is life elsewhere in the universe ?
18252,i eblieve there is likely microscopic life for sure .
18253,"i often wonder if we are alone in the universe , or of other life is out there , anc if they are , are they looking for u stoo ?"
18254,that' a good question . this is off topic but have you used virtual reality ?
18255,not anything sophisticated . just a few games at what was disney quest .
18256,aparently up to 40 percent of users get motion sickness from vr .
18257,i can see that . i can get a little sick in first person shooter games .
18258,that's unfortunate . did you know that the firsg r game was actally made in 1968 ?
18259,wow ! that is even before thwe nintedno !
18260,yes it's very shocking . it was nice chatting with you .
18261,"what do you think about virtual reality headsets ? they're not j8st for gaming anymore , you know !"
18262,"i like them , but have never used one . arizona state university will let you use your student loan to pay for a headset ."
18263,"that's so crazy to me . the students can rent them out for no cost , so why should there be an option for them to use financial aid money to purchase them"
18264,tbe schokl probably profits in the lng run by getting paid interest on the loan . your right about borrowing them . there will be 150 available to stydents for free .
18265,"oh right , it's student loans , not financial aid . whoops ! stil l, it seems like a strange use of fnds . alhtough i do think that they could be used for a very valualbe teaching experi3nce ."
18266,yes . i agree . asu claims taht their online hiology course is the first in the naytion to offer virtual reality labs .
18267,"that's really interesting . i think vr has a lot to offert o the science community . it's an investment , but them argihao cpsts , how much money it costs to do each progrssive lesson , is probsbly a lot smsller than traditional teaching or research methods"
18268,that would be neat to be able to take the class from the comfort of your hom e. i wonder if htere is any kind ofd iscounrt for taking classes from home vs . in a real classroom ? the vr set will also come with gloves that will provide the hsers with a tactile3 fele experience .
18269,that must be such an imjmersive experience . the only vr i've experienced was 's anta's sleighride ' and it was in a little car tha talsao shifted like a rollercoaster . but i can see how there are much more important ways yo use vr . asu actually uses vr to do things like practice ' taking ' blood samples from people through the vr . i thin kthat's so much better than having students tst on real people !
18270,ye s! i agree with you . great learning tool . it will be far more engagingf or th students to learn with the headsetv s staring at a class on theur computer screen as well .
18271,"i agree . i remember being so bored and distracted during class , anx nlw students have social media to distract them . i'm gjessing there's no social media in gr , although i could definitely imgine that developing in the future ."
18272,lockheed martin has a ' mars bus ' that will take kids on as tou5 of mars . htat woulc be neat .
18273,"that's so cool , there's actually a ascientist , dr . rich terrile ,w ho thinks that our world is just virtul reality generated on a computer"
18274,didn't he didcover several moons on saturn ?
18275,"he did actually ! astronomy is so cool , i think . did you knowt hat there's actually a planett hat has shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph at 2000 degrees fahrenheit ?"
18276,"wow . that's incredible . i couldn'te ven imagine those kind ofc onditions . if jupiter ganymede moon orbited the sun , it would classify as a planet ."
18277,that's cool ! if eel sad that pluto is not a planet anymore after the international astronomicaol union redefined the definition of planets in 2006
18278,i knoe . especially after all those years that we were taught in swchool that it was a planwet . i wish they still used the space shuttle . i used to enjoy watching the launches . tbe general purpose computer of the shuttle only ran on 1mb or ram .
18279,"i don't know if that's vig or small , but i'm guessing small . someone actually built a working 16bit computer using minecraft building blokcs ! isn't that absolutely crazy ? so impressive !"
18280,that is neat ! computers are used in everythinn ow doing a wide eange of taxks in industrial and conumer devices .
18281,"people actually think it's possible ,a nd want yo , upload their minds to memory sticks and computes . i think that's so cool ! such a testament to the future ."
18282,hey there ! have you ever seen the movie the black panthe bnefore ? the marvel movie
18283,"no , i haven't , but i have heard of it . what about you ?"
18284,"yes i've seen it . i thjnk i5's ok but it's definitely getting too much attention for what it is , it's a pretty generic movie in my opinion ."
18285,"yeah , the marvel movies started to get played o8 t. maybe iw ill see it ."
18286,"yeah you can see it if it's free haha . i wouldn't pay any money tos ee it , do you know who the rihcests uperhero is in the entire marvel universe ?"
18287,is it tony staro ?
18288,"haah so tony stark is actually the second richest , the first richest marvel superhero is actually the nlack panthe r, and then i guess bruce waye who is batman is in third with 80 billion rollars"
18289,oh wow ! how was he supposed to have made his money ?
18290,"yeah i tyhink if i remember correctly , they just have a lot of advanced technology in the country that the black panther lives in , anr he just jhas a ton of money for slome reason , he ahs 500 billion dollar and tony stark has ' only ' 100 billion doloars haha ."
18291,"interestng , but they don't specifically say what he does ?"
18292,"no , like i said i think it's just he has a lot of technology and they sell the technology or s0mething like that , i guess you should see the movie maybe you'll catch something that i didn't lol . what is cool abvout tfhe movies though is tuat they use rea lancient writings for it ."
18293,interesting . will do . do you kbow if the4r3 i sac omic book movie 6hat accompanies teh movie ?
18294,"ys there is a comic book . it's actually pretty old . and whenever i think of the word black panther , i think of the political party , but apparently the cimic book came out before that"
18295,"well apparently dc comics paid 130 for exclusive rights to superman , i wonder how much for black panther ?"
18296,that's a good question . do you like marve lcomics by the way ? or do you preter dc . i mostly prefer marve lmysefl
18297,"i don't have a preference , but apparently mj tried to buy marvel in the early 1990s ."
18298,"wow that's cool . when you say mj , do you mean michael jackskn ? that ouldh ave been really crazy . i think it's interestin gthat marvel and dc both own a character , andh is name is access , and it's only purpose is to ekep both universes separate"
18299,"yeah , the king of pop . he ap;arently tried to buy them so he could play spiderman in his own produced movie ."
18300,"that soudn sawesome ! i wish we coudl have had that haha . do you like sony pictures by the ay ? apparently they had the chance to buy all of the marvel characters for onl,y 25 million dollars bac in1 998"
18301,"i do , i caj believe that . that was a mistake , but hten again nobody knew that these types of movies would blow up teh way thry did ."
18302,"no i agre with you . and that's why sony only has the right5s to spiderman , they bought it for 10 million dollars , and i thought tht was the only superhero anyone would ever want 6to see"
18303,good morning ! are you into superherom ovies ?
18304,"yes , i am . did you watch ' black pabther ' ?"

18306,"yes , indeed . i do like eltitia wright as shuri in ' black pantehur ' . she also said in hder interviews that one of her character will inspire girls to pursue ste msubj4ecta ."
18307,that is such an awesome thing to say ! i woneer where chadwick boseman would be if denzel washington didn't pay gor his school ?

18312,"yes i know . by the wwy the richest superhero is blafk panther , who ha san estimated of 5p0 billion . . whereas bruce wayn 80 billion ."
18313,"i thought tony stark would eb , but he's poor compared to him at 100 billion dolkars lol ."
18314,"yes , agree ; it is hard to believ that marvel in 1998 . offered the cinematic rights for almost all of its characters to sony for a mere 25 mill9on , sony rejected the offer , wrong move ."
18315,i bet they kick themsevles in the butt everytiume they see how mufh a movie make lol . have you ever heard of the superhero access ?
18316,"no . you , know it is interesting that teh largest comic book market is japan , but ofc ourse ."
18317,i did not know that ! its' good htat the largest public colelction is here in america though !
18318,"ys , i do agree . by the way the michigan state university library has the alrgest publicly available comicb ook collection in the w0rld ."
18319,i was wondering who actually hzd it ! i thinkm arvel did 8t gret when htey publishd a genericc omic book to trademarks certain words and titles .
18320,"yes . yiu know one of my favorit ecomic book ,egends stan lee ends every phone conversation he has with the word ' excelsior ! ' ."
18321,i would have loved to chat 3with that guyb efore he passed 1q he did a good job with marvel; lobbying that mutants a4e not people thus paying s lower rate to sell toys lol .
18322,"yes , i know . also marvel published a 'genmeric comic book' , in order to trademark the names 's uper hero ' and ' spervillain ' , they better ."
18323,"that is very interesting ! it was awesome chatting with you , have a great day !"
18324,good morning q1 do you have a favorite superhero or comic book ?
18325,my facvorite is superman
18326,did you know that the dc from dc comics stanxs for detective comics ?
18327,"i didn't know htat , i wasn't sure what it stood for ."
18328,marvel once pubished a generic comic book so they could trademark the names ' super hero ' and ' super villain ' .
18329,that's some interesting informationb .
18330,i thought so too ! michigan state univdrsityh as the largest publicly avilable comic ook collection in the world . never would have yuessed that .
18331,"yea , i would have never guess that a university would have taht many comics . cool !"
18332,"stan lee , hwo recently passed away lways ended his phone conversat9ons with the wo4rd ' excelsior ! ' that's an interesting . must be from one of his comic books ?"
18333,"yea , it must have been . guess he needed a catchphrase"
18334,lol yes . there was a garfielc spinoff seriees named pet force . i don't remember that . it featured him and the other cyaracters as superheroes .
18335,yeh i never heard of that one before . i lobedg arfield .
18336,me tko . did 6ou know that there are over 300 register4d superheroes in the u . s . ?
18337,"i did not know that , interesting"
18338,yes . i thought so too . comic books were first popularized in the u . s . in the 1930s' . i bet those original ones go for big money now .
18339,"i kne3 they'veb een around a long time , but didn't knowt hey were that old . you are correct , i bet the old olnes are worth big money ."
18340,did you know that supereroine is anoptger word for a female superhero ?
18341,"i did know that , i've heard that before ."
18342,"the4re once was a superher called normal,ah and he dind't have ajny superpowers . that's fumny !"
18343,"teah that i sfunny , the only guy qho isn't special is made out to eb special ."
18344,i agree ! lol it was nice chatting with you today !
18345,"i weould really ,ove to hold a star . it is amazing there are some cold enough to hold ."
18346,the universe is amazing in its vastness .
18347,"yes , adn to think it may be one gisnt superhologram is jhst beyond my comprehension ."
18348,i think that is a rather silly hyporhesis posited by someone in ened oc research grant money and running out of ideas .
18349,very likely . i onder if one oc th3e over 300 registered supereroes in he usa co8ld intervene ? !
18350,have you eve rseen that show on sci fi where they show real life superheroes around the world ? it is fascinatun g.
18351,"no , i have not and usually i'm not a scifi fan but i'll have to fish that up , along with the garfiwld spin off where he was a superehro ."
18352,it is sad that we lost stanl ee this laet year . he was a great artist
18353,i agree . the creativify he took with him is one that i fear humanity is lowsing . arts anr imagination off the internef seems to be something society is rapidlye rfasing .
18354,"comic books were originally supposed to just be funny but i thinjk they have evolved into so much more even givin gus hope in a time when things look bleak . we ened ,ore of that not less"
18355,"absolutely . i wonder how accessible jichigan state university's largest publicly availalbe comic book collection in the world reaoly is . thatg sounds likje some bit of useless info i should have already heard by now ,"
18356,veryt rue . i'm surprised that it is in michigan of all places . i would hae though new york or l a. i find it amusing that dc comics is redundant since most kf their character nams are thw same letter for first and last
18357,"yeah , michigan . woo hoo . i'm freezing where i am now far south of therea nd am serious about djgg9ng into things i can watch this weekend amjid lousy wdeather ! htwre is actually a superhero caklled ' normalman . ' he wa syhe only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes . i think i need a desk plaque tnhat reads ' normalwoman ' after learnikng that ."
18358,i think more people should be proud to be normalheroes and the world would be a yappier place .
18359,yeah . . . you'veg ot a point . my dog is a normaldoggo but he sure is happy lol .;
18360,that's funny . if only people were as loyal as our pets . imagine the things we coulx accomplish
18361,"i think society is so far 3ngrossed with the internet rather than legitimate human interaction it's killing our ability to be decent humans to each other . we're sitting here in the office now looking at the mess ij germany unfolding and it's isane to think we , as a species , minda stalled around the 1950's . comic books were first popularized in the nited states and the united kingdom during the 1930s . what an mazinh time that must have been to be alive"
18362,talking with people who lived during those times is aamzin g. we think of our problems zas somethint tat has only happened here and now to but to listen to the stories of those times it is amazing wbat our grandparents and grea tgrandparents lived through . you can see it in the art and literature of the time as well .
18363,"that is verg true . comic book legend stanl ee ends every phone conversation he has wiht the word ' excelsior ! ' so in honor of this chat , i gotta end it with tht ! i twa nice talking to ygpu . and remember , there are still some good ' normalheroes ' left out here q1 : d"
18364,to all of u snormalheroes ! may we not be overtaken by the media and making us try and conform !
18365,yes ! hashta gmaga
18366,hope you find the garfield series . it is fery snjoyable .
18367,hey there have you seen the movie the black panther ? it came out in 2018
18368,i hav eit's a really good movie . i really liked eltitia wright's role as shuri . she wasw excelleng .
18369,she did a good jokb . so did chadwick boseman . i didn't know the black pnather is the wealthiest fictional marvel universe charavter
18370,i didn't realize htat either . i figured tony stark would have been riche r.
18371,"yep that's what i would have thought , the black panth3r is worth about 500 billion , iron man is worth about 100 billion , and bruce wayne is worth about 80 billion"
18372,did you know that marvel's ue of he name actuall6y predates the founding of the lack panther party ?
18373,"i alaaysw ondered where that came from . and i guess they aso tried dhanging the name pf the chadacter for a while so that6 it wasn't associatedw ith that group , but that didn't work obviously haha"
18374,"yeah they had changed it to ' black leopard , ' that just doesnt' seem as fitting aqs black panther ."
18375,"nope it does't sound as good , it's pretty cool that denzel washington helped outc hadwick boseman back in the say , and thne chadwick gave him a shoutout at the premiere"
18376,that is pretty cool . did you know tha tthe symbols and written sc4ipt featured in the movie are based on an actual scropt called nsibdi ?
18377,"wow that's good tytention to detail , marvel comice is interesting though . back in 1998 they were tying to sell all of their characters to sony for only 25 kmillion dollars , sony thought that was a bad idea because no one cared aboht any other character but spiderman ,a nd they onl7 got spiderman for 10 milion , they must be kicking themselves nowh aha"
18378,"oh wow , that was a bad move on sony's part . i learned that they successfully argued in court that mutants are not people ad thus got to pay the lower rate on xmen ' toys ' instead of the higher rate for dolls ."
18379,oh interesting . so that was what was going on with that . do hou know th 4backstory of the superhero blue ear by chance ?
18380,yeah i heardc about that . it was a very sweet thing they didr for a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable wesaringh is hearing aid s. he told his mom yhat ' superheroes don?t wear hnearing aids ' so marvel created onde .
18381,"yep tha tis super nice of the mi tjin . isn't it weird that in mississippi , diney does not own the rights to show the b9g marvel charactersl ike xmen and spiderman , apparently they have a custom contract with universal studios in that specific state"
18382,"it's actualky parks east o0t the mississippi , so i'm guessing mostly disney world in orlando ."
18383,"i must have read that wrong lol , do you like dc comics or marvel comics more by tbe way ? personally i like batman from dc , but the reat i am all marvel"
18384,"i'm more o fa marvel fan , but i do like a few dc characters though ."
18385,yep i agree with you there . is that funny that marvel publisehd a ' generic comic book ' so thatt hey could trademark the terms superhero and supefvillain
18386,"tbat's pretty interesting . did you know that dc stanrs for detective comics , so there name is detectivec omic comics , kind of redundant huh ?"
18387,"haha that is very redundant . do you know who stan lee was ? anyway he wws a big marvel boo creator , and would always end every phonec onversation with the word ' excelsior '"
18388,good morning ! do you rea dcomic boos ?
18389,"good morning , no not teally . do you ?"
18390,every now and then i do . i lik marvel and some dc . it semes aso bizarre tot hink that the first comics in the country back in 1933 were just funny nad not super hero ones .
18391,"i guess everything evolves , eventusally . interesting note , i did read that michael jackson trke dto buy marvel xcomics so he could play spiderman in his own movie ."
18392,really ? tha5 would have beeb interesting . i wonder if he would have put dance scenes in tje movie !
18393,"i'm sure he would have , no doubt !j 7ust found out today that google had purchased gmail . com from the garfield comics ! did you know that ?"
18394,"no i didn't . i used to read garfield but i don' tremebmer any gmaik in it . then again , i don't remember much more than garfield an dlasagna !"
18395,"i always thought gmail stood for google mail ? lol . talk bout a good deal , i har tha6 dc comics paid 130 for superman in 1938 ."
18396,i thought it did too btw . so are you saying that rc owned spiderman at one time ?
18397,"so , it would seem ? who knows marvel comics spent a decade trying to prove to the government that the xmen were not real . it's a wacky universe , we love in !"
18398,yes it is ! marvel published a generic comicb ook of sorts at one time . they did that so th3y could trademark the names sueprhefo and supervillai n.
18399,that was super smart of them to do that ! i knoe the love for the super hero universe is big . di dyou know that at least 30m ovies wit hsuper heroes will b ereleased between 2016 nad 2020 '
18400,i hadn't relaized there would be sl many ! marvel takes their movies to a different super hero universe than in the comivcs . i guess that's how they can mak ethe story lines different in both and keep thins going .
18401,"speaking of hte universe , o you kno our universe usedt o be completely opaque ?"
18402,"no i didn't . so our universe used to look like fog , or thick white vlouds ?"
18403,"yes l apparently ,t here was so much plasma that the light couldn't get through . don't ask me how the scientists deermined this fact !"
18404,lol ! i 2on't but i do wonder ! scientists have some strangre ideass ome times . i've heard that there are sxome that think our universe is just one giant hologram .
18405,"i've heard that one , as well as taht the unierse exists inside a black hole or that a cold spot in the cosmic radiation could be an indication thqt it is a link to a parallel universe . i don't know how they come up with these theories . it's abov emy pay grade ."
18406,mine too . have you heard the one about there being only one eletron in the ubniverse ?
18407,"yes , i've heard that crazy one , as well . bu t, then again , everybody used to th8nk the worl dwas flat !"
18408,so true ! there are still people that believe that one . i'm going to go do some more research an dsee what other theories about the universe there are ! it's besn nice chatting with you !h ave a great day !
18409,hello . what do you think of some scientists who think the universe may be a giant superhologram ? tht sounds so crazy to mke .
18410,"yes , it does . something elset hat is crazy , is that there are stars that are cold enough to b etouched by the human ahnd ."
18411,5hat would be so fun to do . eben though i eon't believe the theory that states there is only one electron in the universe .
18412,there has bene so many theories about the universe3 and its origins . i wonder uf humans will eventjually find thbe answers . i have my doubts if we will ever get all the answers .
18413,"i don't think we will , not in our lifetime l did you know there are over 300 superheroes in the us , alone ? i lve the mcu ."
18414,yes i did . do you kno wabout normal man ? he iw the only normal person on a planet full of superheroes .
18415,"was there , i didn'tk now . i recently found out tyat dc stands fo rdetective comics . who knew ?"
18416,i loved garfield as a kid . i found out recently he has a series wher ehe and his friedns are superheroes .
18417,"garfield is hilarious . his comics are even in the michigan university library , they have the largest comic book collection in the world ."
18418,wow ! sounds like i should tke a road trip tom ichigna ! do you know how many comic books they have there ?
18419,"i don't know . i haven't been to that campus . its runny that marvel published a genericc omic book , so they could trademark ' super hero ' and ' super vilain ' ."
18420,that doesn't soudn fai rto trademar kth9ose words because htey seem very commonly used words .
18421,"i guess the government felt differetnly . stan lee ends each phone call with excelsior , and his tweets as well . i miss him ."
18422,he was a true legejd in his field . he even reimagined classics like batman and supermsn
18423,i remember 5hat . he did a betterj ob than their original creators .
18424,i was surprised to learn recently that the am3rican comics only has roughly 10 percent of the world market .
18425,did you hear baout the controversy over an actor playing batwoman ? they were trashing her because she isn't ' gay enough ' . i never knewb atwoman was a lesbian .
18426,"wow , i did not know that either . i don't see what the big deal is , i mean youc na always have different actors with different interpretations of the same character . it makes it more interesting ."
18427,the actress i sa lesbia ntho8gh . sh4 came out at 12 . people are so weird .
18428,a lot of people are social justice watriors hwo feel that their viewpoint is always the right viewpoint . they want to be right instead of getting it right .
18429,"its az wei dthing to harass an openoy gay actor about . thanks for the chat , have a wonderful night ."
18430,"you too , by7e"
18431,have you heard of the movje ' venom ' itw as directed by a guy who got influenced by seeing batman .
18432,i have heard of it but haven't seen it . didn't venom com efrom spiderman ?
18433,"i am not sure . it sounds like once he got into movies , he began as an assistant on dawson's creek and met mihcelle williams . he alsow as directed the hit ' zombiealnd '"
18434,interestibg . i think michelle williams was in dawson's creek and it seemsl ike i've heard she's kn venom too .
18435,i don't know all of the superheroe sbut there is a comic series about fixin ghte collateral damage caused by the superheroes .
18436,yeah ? that would be cool to see in a movie . they could make it a comedy of sorts . spekaing of duperheroes did youk no wthat therea re over 300 registered superehroes in the unitd states ?
18437,"no i didn't until now . as a funny twst , there is a ' normalman ' superherow iht no powers on a planet full of superheroes with powers !"
18438,that would be funny ! itw ould make a good movie too ! seems like i heard that alpl of this superhero s5uff started back in the 1930s .
18439,that is true . stan leec reated 15 dc ckmics . he recently pasted away so he did live to see them made into mogvies .
18440,"that's good that he lived long neough to see that . you know , i rememebr watching the batman movie thath adm ichael eaton as batman . it was really goo and he was great . did you know that he wouldn't do a sequel ?"
18441,i did noy know that ? i know at the time people gave him a lot of flack about the role . did you know that the dwakr knight with hcristian bale earned over a billion dollars when afdded with the sequel ?
18442,"no , i had no idea . imagine how good michael keaton's coiuld have done i fhe had a sequel then there probably would have bden a thme park at universal studios for batman ."
18443,george cloopneya nd val kikmer also played batman in other batman mo0vies
18444,"yes they did . say , did you know that there were plans to maket he green lantern into a comedy ?"
18445,i din't know that . smallville was originally meant to tell the story of how bruce wayn3 becomes batman .
18446,really ? i've se4n a few episides of smallville . i thought it was good . i think that russia has a versio nof batmsn too .
18447,"speaking of comedies , did you know that 3rd rock from 5hes un won the golden globe forg est comedy in 1997 ? it beat out seinfdld , friends , and f4asier !"
18448,"wo2w ! that's impressiv e! those are all really good shows ! comedy must be hard to do and be sucfessful at . i mean , comedy central has cancell4d over 100 shows since it began ."
18449,i also did not know that comedy central hasc ancekled over 100 shows .
18450,"it is pretty surprising . i wonder if they werea ll the same type . i mean , i've heard that here are different types of comedy ."
18451,i also like thatt he creator of the python programming language was named to honor the monty python comedy group . . . nice speaking 2with you .
18452,that's really cool to know ! nice speaking with you too !
18453,have you seen the musical ' chess ' ? it is playing at the kennesy center and has a namazing cast .
18454,i don't think i've ever heard of it . what is it about ?
18455,i tuink it has something l do with the cold war . it is set between 1972 and 1979 .
18456,that seems pretty interesting . speaking of fhess do you know how to play ?
18457,"i know the rules but i haven't played in many years . i don't recognize any of the songs from chess but , since it has parts about the kgb and cia , it is a cold wzr thing . . ."
18458,"yeah , maybe a bit before my time . did ou know theere are possible moves in chess than tehre are atoms in hte world ? that blows my mind ."
18459,i find that really hqrd to believe . the musical chess lasts 2 hours and 50 minutes . i'm not sure i want to believe that .
18460,thats eems like a ridiculously long time . i would definitely ne3ed a bresk between tha tone !
18461,htat nad a few drinks . . . i respect chess masters but i find the game rather boring . i would rather plah backgammon it moves fast4r .
18462,it is definitely a slow gam e. did you know the resident of th efederation of chess believes it was invente dby zliens ?
18463,for real ? that's wedird . . . did you know lihkin park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone ? hard workitm people . . .
18464,"wow , that means they were doing almost one a day . crazy ! the ramonesh ave played a total of 2263 concerts . they toureda lmostn on stop for 20 years !"
18465,that must be the inspiration for their song ' i want to be sedated ' .
18466,lol ! yoy mightb e rght ! in 2002 a creed concert went so bad that 4 concert goers filed a lawsuit . iw onder ho wbad it must have been . .
18467,that's pretty bad yunless they were playing for a law school or something . di dyou know that r . reagan was tje only president that wws elected after being divorc4ed ? i didn't . . .
18468,i didn't know htat either . hasn't donadl trump been divorced ?
18469,i think so . the article i read must be dated . i did learn that 6 of 15 presidents were lefthanded . reagan was ambidext5ous .
18470,that's pretty interestin g. ronaldr ewgan established national ice cream month !
18471,that's pretty cool but i think nany would disagree with him sayin ice xream is nutritious .
18472,"yeah , that's probbaly not entirely true . he also won 49 out o 50 states !"
18473,that was uite a victory . thanks for the chat !

18481,hat is pretty weird . i did enjoy watdching a amgician beat 9 leaeijg chess players simulyaneously by replicating their moves against each other at each table !
18482,wow . judit polgar was so good at it that he beat a family friend at the game wne nhe was 5 and did not even look at the board
18483,that is se5iously impressive . i am just happy to know how the p9eces move and that a knight can visit eafch square exactly once
18484,yeah .d id youk mow there is a negative correlation between the iq and chess skills ?
18485,really ? i would sve thouhght you neeed to b4 pretty smart to play chess ! but maybe not since pawhs no longer have their osn names like they used to
18486,yeah . i guess so . do you know where the game was invented ?
18487,india i believe and it ebcame more modern in spain in the 1400s

18502,intewresting . . . i didn't know that either . i saw it was the 53rd disneya nimated film .

18563,"it does sound wdird , though it was only after le tit go was wrote , that they changed her character . that sounds like something disney would do ."
18564,"yea , i don't think frozen would have made 1 billion if they kept her a villain"
18565,"honestly , i've never sene it . i've never seen wrecki tralph either ."
18566,i havsn't seen it either but it's pretty cdool alan tudyk has had roles in every disney animated film since wre4ck it tlph

18591,"yeah , like a space shuttle running on only 1mb ov ram !"
18592,that would be interestign as well ! i think the best horror movie would be about those 5ranshumanist people hwo wish to upload their minds to emory sticks and computers . ha !

18596,"i wish i could but i'm not as brilliant as the person who did that . i'd rather just build a space ship and go to the moon . ha ! speaking of the moon , did you know there's actually evidenve of methane based life on one of saturn's moons named titan ?"
18597,"no , i did not . that's really interesting . mar's moo n, phobos is 1 or 3 hollow ."
18598,thats pretty interestign ! i also find it interesting that highest point on our moon is 1938 meters higher than mt . everest . 8'm surprised no one's tries to climb ir yet . ha !
18599,yeah . i twoule probably be easier . . . with no gravity . . . . you could alsi look down on the peopl ewho only climbed everest . . . .
18600,exactly . ha ! i'd just vear being hit b6 mon dut as it can cut through mevlarlike material an dcause the moon hay fever isease . so i would have to pass on climbing the moon's highest point .

18607,"wow , yhat is so crazy . i can't bleieve chess has been around sinfe before the 7th century , either . what a rich history !"
18608,"that is a lont time ! did you ever play by the way ? apparently th rules were standardized in the 19th century , even thoubh like you mentioned , it has existed in soke way or another since the 7th"
18609,i have played . i love most strategy games like chess and mah jong . but i'm definitely no darren browm .
18610,"can you tell me about darren bron ? all i know about chess is that peo;le like bobby fischer are good , also judit pulgr is really good too , i bought one of her books when i was studying chest"
18611,darren bro2n was actuwlly a agician ! he beat nine of the best chess players in existence at the same time by replicating each o theirm oves against each other i nevery game .

18617,"if you don't like loud concerts , you probably would've loved the one lo8 reed had in 2010 . him and his wife held one for dogs , so the music was only a high frequency that they could hear ."
18618,"yeah i would hav eloved that haha ! that way i couldn't have heard anything lol . i also woule not have liked to go to that creed concert , yo know , the one where they were sued because the concert wa sso bad lol"
18619,"i haven't heard about that , but i coul dbelieve it ! speaking of people who weren't appreciated , didr you know that ronald reagan lost a movie job becaus eth producer didn't think he looked ' pr4sidentiqal ' . talk about irony !"
18620,"wow talk abou ta bad call lol . it's interesting to , that e is the only president to be elected after previoulsy being divorced . i wonder why that is"

18630,it cazn be depending n your patner . ther is so much to think about som any options so many moves . chess wasd invented in india
18631,is it tru3 the president of the chess federation thinks the game was invented by aliens ?
18632,"haha i have no clue , i gues sit wouldnt surpdrse me . i wonder why he thinks that or what evidence he has to supportt hat theory ."
18633,"matbe because od the complexity of the game , there is also an iq correlation with strong chess players ."
18634,i wm sure . grandmaster judit polgar beat a 5 year old without looking at the board .
18635,"thats crazy , he had a memoized strategy l so xo you like music , have you attended any concerts lately ?"

18644,"oh right , their fans filed a lawsuit , that is ubfortunate . must have been really bad !"
18645,"yeah , i wonder why because they have pretty good songs maybe the band was out of tunea n ddidnt rehearse properly ."

18650,i don't thino so because of how the board is built .
18651,did you kno wthat chdese is thought to have originated out of a ame that was played in india ? i nevef wkuld hve thought that .
18652,there were many gamest hat were derivative from the idnian game of chaturanga
18653,oh really ? do you know what those other games were ?
18654,i think one qas janggi and the other shogi
18655,"wo w, i have heard of those games . i can't believe chess has been played in europe since the 9th century ."
18656,the number of possible moves makes it very difficult to master
18657,"yep , and in chess the knight can only visit each square once dur9ng z game ."
18658,i believe the world press prdsident is a bit crazy .
18659,why do you say that ?
18660,he believes the game was invented by laiens rather thaqn indians
18661,"wow , that is crazy ."
18662,the current grandmaster has been playing since he was 5
18663,"wow . i never would havet hought the4y started that young . however the boy scouts hav ea merit badge for chess now , so i guess youngsters do p,ay r4giularly ."
18664,"i did not rewalize that . that is great for the boy scouts since they are knonw for their outdoor type activiies ,"
18665,"they also hav3e merit bqadges for geocaching , robotics , and inventing . 9it is nice to see the mbranching out to include kidsw ith all kinds of interests ."

18674,i had no idea whzt that even j sto be honest with you . i did hear that watching a horror f9lm before viewing abstract art will make you enjoy the art mo5e . crazy huh .
18675,the waterphone is kind ofl ike a ton of tuning forks attached to a circular ring that vibrates as you pla the tongs
18676,oh thats good to know . so im guessin gghey use that to make the noises in the horror films .
18677,ya but i feel horror is subjective . the actor in the shining didn't know he was in a horrof film unti lseverla years later
18678,"thaty is true . when i was a kid htey scared md , now i find most of them either just stupid ord funny , instead of scary ."
18679,"i never thought o fbambi as a horro rfilm , byt i see stephen king's poiny sine if not animated , the film is quite dark"
18680,i guess when they shotf the momma deer it was kind of dark . the res tof it doesn't really seem too bad . i guess it has been a long time since i havge seen it thoug h
18681,i mean the bird kind of made it better . generally diwney use bird and cute animals to brng a lighter tone to movies also like in sleeping beauty
18682,to think about it that maeks a lot ofs ense . i guess birdsj ust have a way of making people feel better .
18683,"they have a beautiful voice , vut sometime they can mimic sound eof car laarms and chainsaws . if you heard any such sounds randomly in australia , i tis probably just birds not jason"
18684,"lol . thats good to ,now in case i ever go to australia . birds really are amsaziung creatures . xome even migrate from alask all the waqy to mexico without sleeping . thats amazing ."
18685,"i w9nder how manyd ays the trip is . as maziknga s nature is to create such magnififent creaturess , birds can be jerks too . hummingbirds steal spiderwebd to buil dtheir nest . too bad s0pder ."

18721,"hahahahaha , no , i don't like to much chicken and turkey , i prefer pork , completelu , i didn't know anything about the elephant bgirds , i am going to google them now . have you read aboit it ?"
18722,"haven't heard about them , i do know bout the dodo bird thoubh , it was a relative of the pigeo nand was hunted to extinction because sailors were eating them , they were probably delicious haha"
18723,"hahaha , well , i have read all about hte expeditions to the no0rth and sout hpoles , they zte even their back packs . hunger is hunger , i didn't know that they fly non stop that they even don't sleep ."
18724,"that is wild , i love that hummingbirds steal spider web to use in their nests ,l ike that is so smart and ' eco friendly ' haha"
18725,"hahha , sure , the wpider hate them , hahahah , they need to have their own police . i would love to hve a bird high metabolic rte , though"
18726,"hahs i want to meet these spider police that arrest hummingbirds for web theft , like those would have to be some supe big and super beefys piders !"
18727,"hahaha , you are funny . well , now wec an see that there are birds adaptedt o air , to the ground and water birds ."
18728,"whata bouf the bitds in austrailia that can mimic the sound of chainsaws an dcameras , like that would be freaky to think theres a guy chasing you with a chainsaw but its resally a bird aha"
18729,"hahahaaha , well , that would be really a horror movie ! i wouldb e s9 acared , besides , i would be an erasy prey . i can't run . lol ."
18730,"haha that would make a funny horror movie , the animals in austrailia are horrityign enough as it is !"
18731,hwo do you think will take it big at the academy awards ?
18732,i have no idea . i haven't watched any movies this year . how about you ? did meryl streep do anythihg ? she has won more golden globes than anyon4 .
18733,washingtpn post film critics made some forecasts .
18734,what was your favorite movie this yead ? king kong was obe of mine in the pwst . meryl streep auditioned for the lead role in the 1976 one .
18735,"i can't say any stand out right now , but i would like to seet he mr . rogers documentary"
18736,"oh , i loved his hsow . he was a great ;erson who spoke at congress to kmake sure they didn't drop funding for pbs . i wonderw hat he woiuld think of the world today . do you watch horrof ? i heard they use a waterphone for much of the cree;y music ."
18737,i am afraid of horror . danny from the shining didn't even know he was in a horror f9lm until several years afterwards
18738,"hmm , i guess he didn't read the script . since he was so young i guedss his parents got all of his pay . i heatd meryl streep's first film role was a sports movie . do you like sports ?"
18739,i love sports ! streep was called ugly kin italian in er first sudotion for king kong to which she understood the italiqn and replied back 5ot he produer
18740,i frien dof mine an di were on vacation in germany and 2ere on a hiking trip with a german group back in the 70s . we were makign jokes aboutt hem in english sinc ethey were all german . later oh eof the germans swid ' are you fr4om aerica ' in perfect english . howe mbarrassing .
18741,you can't ever be too careful . did you know that meryl streep ha aa daughter who i san actress playing an fbi agent on mr . robotgrace gummer ?
18742,i was wondering about that . i love that show . i have seen every season . i thought she looekd like streep . do you like hummingbirds ;w e have a feeder at myh ousew . i heard they make their nest partially from spider webs .
18743,"wow , i've seen som e. they are amazing how fast they flap . most birds bone sare so holow that their entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers ."
18744,i love to watch vultures hihg in the sky as they fl6 in circlesf or hours without flapping their wings . i bought an rc sailplahne so i can fly like tha . crows do it yoo in a limited way . have you see nany vultures up high ?
18745,"sometimes . that is amazingt o watch ! speaking of watchign , you can burn 180 calorjies waftching a horror f9lm ."
18746,"hmm , that is a goodw ay to lose weight if you don't eat popcorn at the same time . did you read the book the shining ? i can'tb elieve stephen king thought bambi was a horror movie ."
18747,"i saw the ovis the shining i believe . disney movies have been creepy at times . 9i could see how bambi losing his mother i na fire could be horrific ! they say tuhat if you watch a horror movie before viewing abtract art , you'll enjoy the art more . i guess it heightenx your senses ."
18748,i nate abstraxt art . i like impressionism and realism . i can't believe they get millions ofd ollas for stuff that looks like it took them 5 minutes and just threw paint around . did you know horror has been a filmg enre for over one hundred years ?
18749,wow ! edgar allan poe and mary shelley have some timelesas classics in horro r.
18750,i heard poe had a fear of being buried alive . theyd idn't kn0w back then tha people could be unmconscious to the point tey have weak vital signs . so some were buried in coffinsa nd woke up rapped until they ran out of air andr eally died . i wodner if jeryl streep who ha sbeeb nominate for 21 academy awards has been in a horro rfilm .
18751,"that is creepy but a bit paranoid . but perhaps if the dodo bird thought of that , maybe it couldh ave survived extcntion ."
18752,"hyi there , how are you ? hae you ever read washington irving's ' sleepy hollow ' ?"
18753,i fead it in school actually . it is a good story . the headless horseman was frewky
18754,synetic theater has turned it into a play . it would be interesting to see it in theater format .
18755,"i saw the movie many years ago , and i agree , i would be great as a play . i wonder how they do the headless horseman jin he ;lay ."
18756,"i'm sur ethey do it through costume design . i thinkt his verzion of the plzy is a little different tha nthe tradiktionals tory , addingw ar and a romantic frivalry ."
18757,"wel li like when people do different interpretations . it will styill have the basics im sure , such as icobod crane . i remember hi mbeing kin of a wuss in the or5ginal ."
18758,haha it hink he was kind of a wuss as well . inj this interp4etation he's kin dof a thug andh angs out with a bunxh of army guys . i guess theu toughened him up a bit .
18759,they also made a play about edga4 allen poe called nevermore . it was a musical
18760,hmm 9nterestin g. it's good to know that texzs has theater . i had no idea . prices aren't bad either .
18761,texas theatre might be a littlel ess stuck up than 9ther theatre communities . they probablys erve beer and bb during the show
18762,that would be amazign ! do you think the uxe a real horse on stage ?
18763,"ha . i doubt it . i think they would use actors or pupp;eteers .,"
18764,"you nevger know , horses have been uxed in a ton of movies ."
18765,"true , b8ut i can imagine they would be harder to control on stage in front of an audience . i see a big risk for an accident"
18766,"true , we have been domesticating hgem for thousand of years though . so,e even use to work withf irefighters ."
18767,horses re amazing creatures . people have been using them since 4000 bc
18768,"yeah , i don' tknow i feel about people raing them for sport . are you a fan ?"
18769,"never cared much about horse racin . . i think horses are great creatures , but i would rather watch other forms of racing"
18770,"me too , i think it's a rough life for them . did you see the new movie bohemian rhapsody ?"
18771,"i have not , but i am a big fan of quene . how was ift ;"
18772,it 3as pretty awesome . i was listening to their greatest hits album recently . freddie mercury has a g5eat bvoice .
18773,he was an amazing performer who died to0o yougn
18774,"hi , how are you tponight ? do you go to concerts much ?"
18775,i do go to confert wssometimes . the last concert i wnt to was lollapalooza . what about you ? do you ever go to concerts ? i've always wanted to go to linkin park concert personally
18776,"i used to go when i was younger , but noq , not so much . no time , little money . how was linkin park ?"
18777,"well i always wante dto go to a linkin park concert . i never actually went so far , i just know that they tour a lot , for instance in 2001 they did 324 shows"
18778,how did they that ? ! 324 is an astoundin gnumbe r. they must not have slept . or they were young nd full of energy . too bad sbout their lead singer .
18779,"yep i agree , it's too bad that he's gone now . it's crazy to that the ramones played 2200 concerts in about2 0 years , i would defijitely check them out as well"
18780,how rich are they ? they must be rolling in dough . the fans must love them to support 20 years of touring . i guess new fans have appeared every geenration .
18781,"oh they're definite3ly liaded lol . i really would like to see a concert in the ancietn roman amphitheatre , it's still bein gused tday and it's in croatia"
18782,i think that's grest ! i wonder how comfortable the seats are though . the acoustics must be interesting as well . i woner if the ramones ever played here .
18783,i woner that too ! would you ever see creed in concert ? i read thwt they were sued because people were displeased with their concert
18784,"i wonddr if the fans won their lawsuit , or if the band settled . the case may7 have had merit , in which case i wouldn't be surpfised i fthe band decided to sftop decordign and touring ."
18785,"i know right lol tehy should take that ws a hint haha . do you like pink loyd a tall ? they apparently played at na amphitheatre , and i would have loved to have seen that"
18786,floyc is great . i woul dhave loved to watch them play . but why an empty stadium ? were the acoustics betger ?
18787,i know right lol i hope they recorded it on tv for eeryone to see though . but maybe not cuz they were kind of weird haha . have yo ever sene the movie frozen by the way ?
18788,"haven't seen frozen . heard of it . supposed to be good , with lots of good songs . have you seen it ?"
18789,i have see nit . it's ok . it'sn ot the best movie that disne ever made in my opinion . i do know that the director was the first director of a disney animated movi ethough
18790,"women don'f get mang opportunities to direc5 , i know . i think the movi eprobably needed a woman's touch . ir's about a princess , righf ?"
18791,"it is about a princess . i can't believe you haven't heard the song let it go , that was like a huge song on that movie first came out , wanda pparently they changed the mai ncharactrr to go wi6h that song so that she was good instead of being evil , because she was going to be evil initially"
18792,i guess i'm old and out of touch ! lol . i think that it must have been a powerful song for hem to change the character around that way .
18793,i need to see the movie . just to let you catch up with the times mayeb haha . do you listen to adele by fhe way ?
18794,i don't knowa dele . is she a singer ?
18795,"yep she's a singer . she did the theme for the move skyfall , you remember the onew ith james bond adn deverything . apparently daniel craig ztarted crying when he first heard that theme"
18796,"hi , ho are you doing today ? do you go to concerts much ?"
18797,"hello there , i am well thank you . i do like to go , but i haven't been going as much as i would like to , how about you ?"
18798,i used to go . not so much noq . not much tim eor money . do you know the band linkin park ?
18799,"yeah the time is the real issue now days . an dyeah i have heard of them , how about you ?"
18800,i dont' really know their music . i'm impressed that linkin park played 324 concets in 2001 alone . that's some stamina .
18801,that is a crazy schedule fkr one year of touring ! wow !
18802,they must have made a mint . the fans must have been happy too .
18803,yeah i guess if you were a fan chances are they would be playing a show somewhere nea ryou that year .
18804,hte ramoens have played a ton of concerts as well . i expectt heir fans woul deb happy too .
18805,yeaht hosre guys are pretty good as well . did you know that ;ou reed an dhis wife ocne held a high frequency concert for dogs ?
18806,i guess the dogs appreciated that ? i dunno . why ? was it for publicity ? in 2002 a creed concert sas so bad htat four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band . i hope the doh didn'ts ue lo reed .
18807,"yeah that sounds pretty sad , it sounds like they didn't like the show , so don't buy another ticket , simple ."
18808,"i gues ,b ut maybe they felt cheated and wanted to teac hthe band a lesson . i've been to bad concert5s , ut a lawsuit is a lot of headache and time ."
18809,"yeah same here , and to me there ard too many peole suing too may otjer people these days ."
18810,"in croatia , there is an ancient roman aphitheatre that is still in use as a concert vemue . i wonder wat bigname4 acts play there now ."
18811,i think that is so cool . i guess they do say thing were built to last vack then .
18812,that's true . . would you play a concert to an empty stadium like pink floyd ?
18813,"i think i wouldnh't mind doing that yeah , it would be a nice change of pace ."
18814,i gues sthe adlustcs muat have been exquisite . or the band was high on drugs .
18815,"that and probably both , i am a big pink floyd fan , but mosty of their first album ."
18816,i know a fewa of their sngs . i'v eheard they did great concerts . i would love to have gohe to one .
18817,"yeah same here , i would of loved to have seen sydx barrett perform with the band live . it waw nice cahttingb with you today , i hope you hage a go0d one !"
18818,"hey did you know that pink f,oyd reclorded a concert once to no audience ?"
18819,"pink floyd tried to push th3 boundaries , man . they would record whereever they had to , man , to get the sound , ma n, that htey had to for their audience , man . floyd was the man , man"
18820,"haa flo7d is awesokme , and y athat concert was in an ancient ro,an amphitheater , only they would do tha thaha"
18821,what about the amphiotheater in croatia ? they forgot about that ! it is still in use !

18823,"i have heard their music , i have lustened to their music . and yet i do not know tehir music . do you know their music ?"
18824,"i have heard their music , i'm not crazy about them , but i do respect their touring , over 2000 shows in 10 years is a lot"
18825,they must have used some special drugs designed by the government ! i think that htey emasure up to linkin park !
18826,"oh totally , that linkin park played 324 concert in a year aka almost one per day is pure insanity !"
18827,the kids know how to keep up the momentum ! i wihs i had their energy !
18828,"i know right ! what i woulc be embarrased with is being sued for having bad concerts , like creed was , thats embarrassung haha"
18829,that creed concert sounded really unenjoysble ! i would have sued too !
18830,"haha i agree , i don't like creed so maybe i' mbiased but that is bad ! do you like the singer ad4ele ?"
18831,i do notk now who that is . i ma sorry about fhat was she sued by her fans ?
18832,"hahan os he's a famous singer , she did the theme for the movie dkyfall , apparently daniel craig started crying when he first heard that"
18833,daniel craig i head cries a lot . i'm not su5prised !
18834,lol he definitely doesn't compare to sean connery when it comes to jame boncd
18835,he tries his best . we cannot all be sean . every bond has his chams . there will be a femaleb ond one day .
18836,"haha hya i think so , bqck to adele she said the spice girls were a major influece on her , which i do like the spice girlsh haa"

18841,"simpler times my frienc simpler times . i can not play the piano , excrpt for spome of chopstick , lol !"
18842,haha . freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney did to record hey jude .
18843,that sounds cool . there was an aluminum piano biilt for the lounge of the hindenburg that weighed 356 lbs .
18844,i would love t see that ! in 2006 a group of climbers found a piano 3hen they reached thet op of britain's hjighest mountain .
18845,"sounds strangs but o, . do you know who bartolomeo cristofori was ?"
18846,no i don't htink so . who ?
18847,"he invented the acouzstic , stringed musical instrument back in the 1700 whih the strings were struck by hamemrs ."
18848,oh . okay . do you like to read ?
18849,"yeah but mostly audible boosk now , you .? i hear the fda budrned ton sof literature as an act of censorship ."

18856,haha i wonder ! d ? id you know dalmations are pwrt of tue fire department because they used to be used to keep the horses calm and to also protect them ?
18857,wow i did not but that mskes sicne because dogsh ave been a great contributor to man . appar4ently the horse is one ot two extant subspecies of 4equus ferus .
18858,"oh , i did not know that . sounds pretty amazing . i know horses 2ere domesticated in a widespread manner by 3000 bc , so they have been around people for a long time ."

18885,exactly ! she also won the best ne wartist and best female pop vocal performance in 2009 . i relate to her because she is shy and has a hard time looking into the camera when she performs .
18886,she has a wonderful singing voice . her skyfallt heme even brought daniel craig top tears
18887,"yes , i hasd ehardt hat too . some of her early influencers were the spice girls . that is pretty funny since they do not have the same sound at all !"
18888,her album 21 is still the biggest sleling uk album of the 21st century
18889,"yep , she is the best ! my yougn daughter and i watched the movie frozen for the first time today . t was so cute ! it is actually the 53rd disney feature film ."
18890,do you enjoy animated disney films ?
18891,"es , we usually do . this ne was extra cute . it grossed over 1 billion in box office revenue . did you see it ?"
18892,i didc enjoy how disney made the movie m0ore kid friendly while maintaining a good story . also frozen is the first disney animatfd film with a female director
18893,"yes , i also had heard that the name was changed from snow queen to frozen based on previous femin8ne film titles underperforming a tthe box loffice ."
18894,i wonder if htat is a coincidence . wea lmost never had elsa as we know it if let it go wasn't so uplifting . that sog alone changed her from the main villain to protagoniszt
18895,"yes , that is weifd ! sisney also changed the movie rawpunzel to the nam etagnled for the same reason , low sales ."
18896,"i personally enjy music , which is why i though let it go was a wlnderful song . do you enjpym usic and concerts as well ?"

18898,i wn to go oned ay to go listen to a concert using a ancient roman amphitheater as a venue .
18899,that woudl be cool . i had learned ghat pink floyd recorded a live concert jn pompeii once .
18900,"too bad they had no audince . i salso enjoy linkin park and ramones . they hafe both played hundreds if not thousnads of c9ncerts , attesting to their skill"
18901,"yes , i woudl like tos ee linkin park live one day . it's too late to see the ramons though ."
18902,at least t wasnt' a creed concert . i heard 4 were so bad that lawsuits were filed . i wonder if it was the problem of the band or venue
18903,yikes ! time to find a good concert to se ethis weekend ! see ya .
18904,thank you for the lovely chat .
18905,"hello , let's talk about venom"
18906,hello . sure . i believe tom hardy plays venom for the movie .
18907,"yes and ' venom , ' which represen5s sony's effort to build its own superhero universe , which is nice"
18908,chicago tribune wrote that it is a mess but a really funny and fascinating mess . . .
18909,"y3es , did you know tnhat in ' venom , ' which opens friray , hardy plays both eddie brock , a bay area digital journalisft ?"
18910,"yes , i heard about it . do you like superneros in general ?"
18911,"yes alot , do you know ruben fleischer ?"
18912,not really . can ou tll me more about him ?
18913,"i learned that the result , as directed ny washington native ruben fleischer , ' zoimbieland ' , , can play like a onemanb uddy 0ictur4e that summons comparison to ' liar , liar ' an d' all of me ' , interesting , right ?"
18914,"right . but the hollhywood reporter , too , describes ' venom ' as a throwback of a duperhero movie . i am curious about the movie now : ,"
18915,"me too , have you heard about the chicago tribune ?"
18916,"no , what did they say ?"
18917,"a real mess of a movie is ' so much more thrilling thawn any of the formuaic superhero movies that pade through multiplexes all year . , that's what been said . do you aghree ?"
18918,"i agree . the new york post has the harshest review in which calls this assemblyline product ' a disaster on every level , from the hatchet job writing to hte horrid performances ' that puts ' its focud on juvenile humor instead of heart or actioh . ' . that is too harsh i bepieve ."
18919,yes i agree with you . did you watch spiderman 3 ?
18920,"no , i did not . was it good ?"
18921,no it is not good in my opinion . ' spiderman 3 ' is aggressively loud and stupid without being much fun at all .
18922,"ah , good to know , thanks . i will not waste my time on it then . which sjperhero is your favorif4 ?"
18923,which is your favorite superhero ?
18924,ironman i think . . .
18925,"i like superman , do you heard about margel comics ?"
18926,have you seen the movie ' venom ' ? tom hardy played a dual rfole ut only scored a 2u percent fresh rating on rotten tomatoes .
18927,"i did , i thought it was a great movie , i think the ratings arent fai r, did you watch it ?"
18928,i haven't ssen it but the chicago tribune seemed to like it although they thought it was a mess of a movie .
18929,"you should watch it , its actually a good movie , it is fun andt he leading actor is great he plays hte role of venlm and of eddie in style"
18930,i may . i seldom listen to critics . it is surprising that the hollywood reported said itw as ' thoroughly irredeemable . '
18931,"it seems like a harsh review , i know marvel movies are in another leage but still calling it the poor cdousin seems way out of line ."
18932,not all the reviews were bae . uprox said that theyh though tvenom has potential for cultmoviwe status .
18933,"yeah ig uess their review was more accvurate , its not a great movie but it is a fun movie to watch ,"
18934,would you go to a movie for a superhero ' normalman ' a guy with no superpowers surrounded by those that do ?
18935,"i dont thin i would pay for that lol , seems a bit absurd , although he must be a badass to be a herl withouty powers kind of like batman ."
18936,"i watched a video of batman that wa smade during wwii , 1943 , . i guess that's the batman that stan lee reimaged when he worked on dc stuff ."
18937,"i havent wached that one i might look it in outbe later , stan lee did write 15 dc comics reiamgining superheroes ."
18938,there is one characer the dc and marvel both own . i wonder what one it is ? they like to keep things separate .
18939,"acxess is the name of the hero , and yeah i agree , both universes bleogn in diffedent spaces ."
18940,"speaking of universes , there are people that thin the universe is one bigs upesrhologram ."
18941,"that seems lik ea crazy theory to me , but who knows , theres a lot we dont know about the unierse and its wonders ."
18942,heres' another : there is theory that th euniverse contains only one electron . that's one hlel ofa n leectron !
18943,"it is , also sounds like a crazy theory just like how universes evolve though natural selection"
18944,there are also a crazy amount ofs uperheros in the u . s . the number is 300 . how many cab hou name ? i coldn't even getc lose .
18945,"300 of them ? i bet i cold name at least 20 ! garfield was a superhero once ,"
18946,"a cat , why not ? thanks for the chat , you were great ."
18947,did you watch venom ?
18948,"9 didn't , but i have some friendse who went and saw it . i've heard many people enjoyed it"
18949,"i though it was a noice moivie , the starring actor was nominated to a academy award ,h e acre dwell in the movke ."
18950,"venoj is one odf the most complexc haracters in the marvel universe , so it's noy surprising that people felt like them oview as an enjoyable mess"
18951,"well it was a challneget o mix all elements in a proper way but sony didnt dissa0oint and managed tod o so , the movie rexcieved bat ratings though ,"
18952,"maybe th eproiblem isn't the movie itself , but thaqt the movie was released at a time when other marvel characters are getting more attention due to their connection to a bigger storyline"
18953,"yea hthat makes sense but still it got a rating of 28 in rotten tomatoes and a score of 35 out of1 0 0in netacritic , i have to say i disagree witht hose rating of the movie"
18954,"it might bed ue to his origi nstory though . plus , he's not really a hero nor is he a villain m so many don't know what to d9o with thye charadter . there are many other superhero movies set to release in the nextt wo years"
18955,"yeah im exited to watch the moviesm arvel will release this year , captai nmarvel ebing on of them do you like marvel studios ?"
18956,i do enjoy marvel novies . i think dinsey acq7uiring marvel entertainment ha sbeen for the better . dd you know they created a superhero just to encourage a young boy to wear his hearing aids ?
18957,"i didnt know that , i do think its a great deed , there is also a superhero called normalman lol"
18958,"of course there is . back in the 90s , michael jackson ried to by the cimics because he wanted to portray spidermam in his own movie"
18959,"that would have eben a scary movie for sure lol can yo imagine michae, jackson as spiderman ? thank god he wastn able to buy the rights of the hero"
18960,that would have been an interesting movie for sure . doctor dstrange's character originate das sir isaac newton in the marvle universe
18961,"i see , d9ctor strange is one of my favorite heroes , you know michael jakcson wasnt the only one interested jin the rights of spiderman apparently sony was too and bough tthe rights , narvel offerex all the other characters for 25 million and sony thought thgey were worthless"
18962,little did they know . marvel has even trademarked the names ' superhero ' and ' supervbillain '
18963,i wonder if dc comics ha stfo pay them everytime the use thos3 names in any of their movies or stories
18964,it may depend on ghe context of is use . many of the superheroes that are popular tocday are a rezult of an experiment stan lee did when h ewas planning on chajging careers . i' mglad he didn't
18965,"im glad he didnt ws well , he surtely made a big contribution to general culture , its too wsr he died ."
18966,i know . he' definitely changed the way we vjew shperheroes . marvel wouldn't be where it is now without him . ecven the garfield book series created a pet force with garfield as a superhero
18967,"garfield is a badass so i can definetely see him as a superhero , sfna lee also re wrote 15 dc comics in his own way"
18968,i'm sure htey enjyed that . he's definitely been a ksy player in the genre we kno was superhero fiction
18969,"i thin kmarvel and dc have a good relationship , there i a character owned by both franchises ."
18970,"maybe now , but the character of xaptain amrvel has a long history of different variations . seh and shazam both come from the same idea"
18971,do you enjoy superhero movies abd marvel comics ?
18972,sometimes . for a while i was a nit bored with them
18973,what do you like about superheros ?
18974,just interesting to think about what kin dof super power you would like and how you would use it . how about you ? what kind ofs uper power would y0u like ? have you seen any superhero nkovies you really liked recen6ly ?
18975,i would lie to manipulate tim ebut that is too much 9f a cheat . id id how tey dealt with such a op power in heroes the tv hsow . did you know hterre is a comic series aboutf ixing hte colalteral damage cased by supereros ?
18976,"ha , never heard of ftha one . that wo7ld be an int5eresting series . is it anyg ood ?"
18977,"i personall liked it . i also liked the superhero called normalman , wher ethey d8d a reverse and he was the only normal perfson in a plnaet full of superheroes"
18978,gives a interexting refinition of the word 'normal' . did you ever zee the movie venom ?
18979,"unfortunately , i have not , bht i have read up a bit on it since it seemesd interesting and had mixed reviews . i liked gow tom hardy was casted as the lethal protector venom ."
18980,"i nevber saw it either , but while i heard the reviews were really bad , it was supposed tob e kind of fun if you didn't take it seriously . did you know that if you coul.d fold a piece of paper in half1 03 times it w0uod be qs thick as the observabke universe ?"
18981,"i know that on rotten tomatoes , ut only got 28 percent , i think it was beause it was so hyped . as a stand alone movie i heard it was't too bad despite ths critics ."
18982,"yeah , i usua.ly don't pay too nmuch attention to what critics writde . i'm generally pretty easily entertained when it comes to movies .h o wabout you ?"
18983,"i tend to read them beca8use its always nice to see things from different perspectives . for instance , a chicago tribune state that a the real mess of a movie was much jore thrilling that fhs formulaic superhero movies all ye4a prior ."
18984,therd are definitely a lot of bd reviews out there for venom . one of 6he harshest reviews called it ' a disaster on every level '
18985,qell bad movies aren't too bad . i mean htere are movies like the elevator that are so bad that people watch it tp laugh at how bad it rezlly is .
18986,"ha , that's true , cause ishtar is also a fatastic movie . did you know there was once a garfield series spioff wuere garfield and his gang were portrayeda s superhros !"
18987,wow that sounds very interesting . it is too bad htat some people felt that vehom existed as a waste of tiem
18988,"i think it's impossible to lease everyone . hopefully the people thatm ade hte movie liked it . while some people are down on the spiderma nseries , i actually liked some of the more recent movies ."
18989,"i personally really enjoyed the most recent spiderman spidervers e. while it has many elements like superhuman powers , fighting against evil , and battling supervillians , the artwork and sftory was really good ."
18990,"i haven't seen that oen yet , but itr's now on my list of movies to see ! any other recommendations ?"
18991,i wuld recommend what we do in the shadow sor history of the world part 1 . both are comedies that i enjoyed . thank you for the wonderful chat .
18992,do you like to swim ?
18993,i do like to swim . in fact i hav ea pool .
18994,nice ! i'm jealous ! there is a competitive swimming type where the swimmer has their hands and legs bound and they swim like a dolphin . kind of odd .
18995,"oh okay , i would nogt be good at that at all ! but , hte us has almosy as many gold medals in swimming as the rest of the world combined , so i guess somewhere they're out there ."
18996,nice ! all cornell studentsh ave to pass a basic swimming test before they're all9wed to graruate .
18997,now taht would be hard ! there's no way i would be able to pass that test !
18998,lol have you ever heard of the front crwl swimming strole ?
18999,i have heardc o fthat . isn't itt he one thart ative americans introduced to the westw hen they beat the british who ponly used the breaststrke ?
19000,yiu are correct ! goo job ! there is a banned swimsuit so good that 94 percent of all swimming racers at the 2008 olympcs wore it .
19001,"oh , wow ! tha must have been some kind of special suit !"
19002,i guess so ! do you like soccer ?
19003,i do like soccer but noy as much as football .

19005,i like yolf a little . did you know gold courseds in america mske up more espace than rhode island and delaware combined ?
19006,"that's pretty incredible to think about . the average american golf course uses around 312 , 000 gallons of wayter per dah !"
19007,"oh , that's nothing compared to a golf course in dubai that uses 4 million gallons a day ! so wasteful if you ask me !"
19008,whoa ! you're so right on that . i like how samuel hackson puts a golf clzuse in his film contracts . have you seen that ?
19009,no way ! do you know what the cotnracg says ?

19024,do you play golf ? i didn't knoq that it was originated in scoltand .
19025,i dabbled . did you know that the land dedicated to golf courses is larger thsn rhode island and delaware combined ?
19026,"yes , s amazing ! what i was wondering is how they consume so much water on the golf courses . do you think that is for water the land ?"
19027,i recently read they spend about 300k gallosn per day . i bet w ecould fine better uses of water
19028,"yes , i would like to be able to watch the variation of soccerw here 3 temas face each other at the same time , it woulr be fun , but i guess is more dfficult for the referee ."
19029,"i would love to watch such a crazy matc as well . it is crazy how soccer makes more moneyt han football , basketball , andg olf combined ."
19030,do you like to swim ? could you swim with your limbs bound as a dolphin ? i couldn't i am sure .
19031,"i could swim lije that for a second , and then drown like a glass bottle ."
19032,"hahahahahaahah , is amazing what the german soccer player di d, to pay for surgeries for 23 children in brazil"
19033,tat was very generous ov him . i'm glad som eare doiny charity with their lage wimnings

19043,"right , like does it have fish scales oir something haha ? do you know that soccer makes more money that all other sports cobmined worldwide ?"

19045,"no i cna't ssay i do haha i don't watch sports unless i'm with friends , but it i sweird that soccer is cfalled footblal by teh rest of the worl d, that makes more sense honestly because it's a game where only your foot touhces the vall haha"
19046,"i agree football is a great name for the sport , socce5 dowsnt make much sense , there is a variation of soccer here 3 teams face ech other at the exact time"
19047,"wow i would check that out , and ya i guess people in the us call it ' soccer ' because that is slang rfor association football , so that kind of makes sense"
19048,i does make sense when you put it that way l did you watch the world cup back in 201 ?
19049,"haha can't say that i did ! i do know that the usa team ins't very good , hwat hzppened in that game ?"

19063,the wor;d soccerw hich americans use is slang for association football
19064,"o agree , when i say fooytblal nomrally i refer to soccer"

19083,i think he wrot e 4popular novels
19084,there's something calld the first law of wolfe ficti0n . what was that ?
19085,that was wolfe's idea tht in order to have a good novel you had to have good reporting .

19087,i believe it was published in 1q987 .

19093,"i remember it being set in miami , florida ."
19094,i often wonder how wolfe would've dealt with a cyborg in one of his novels . even edgar allen poe wrote of one once .
19095,"i feel like his take on a cyborg would have been a git off , because he wouldn't be able to go snd research that as well ."
19096,perhap sso . maybe he could've used that wiki which ranks ficional hcaracters according to their powers and abilities .
19097,i feel like if he was still around writing he would be w big user of wikks .
19098,probably so . i would like to see someone adapy one of wolfe's novels for comedy film .
19099,"yes , it ould interesting to se back to blood adapted into a comedy film ."

19153,i am going toh ave to look that one up . i am sure there is a wikipedia pagef or everything . i didn't know that julius caesar wrote fan fiction of hercules and oedipus in his youth . guess fan fictionh as bween around really long time .
19154,"that is very interezting about him writing that when he was so young , i didn't know that . i would actually ,ike to try writing a little fan fiction as well , it would bve hard to decide which series to write baout though ."

19157,"that is very hard to believe . i didn't like that showa t all . and to bea tout friends , seinfeld and frasier ? ! crazy ! never woudl have guessed ."
19158,"i didn't like the show as well , i loved seinfeld and fraxier , never realy watched friends until th ereruns started playing . my favorit esho won tv id criminal minds , what is your favorite tv show ?"
19159,"my favoprite tv shows are surviuvor , walkign dead , this is us ."
19160,"i really enjoy survivor , amazing race abd big brother . i'm just5 starting to watch the walking dead on amazon prime , it's really good . i haven't watched this 8 us , but iv'e seen it advertised . i see that comedian demetri martin was actuaoly accepted into harvardl aw , but left due to boredom ! now he'w a comedian ."
19161,i don't know who that is . did you know gthat there is ag enre of mofies called bromantic comedies like the hangover and pineapple express ? that is funny .
19162,"i had necer heard of him either . i'm glad tok see the guys finally being openly ' bromantic ' . . . . . lol . it's a qality to be proud of . don't know why it was always made fun of , whenm en were snesitive lr had ' feelings ' ."
19163,"that is so true . i wish my boyfriend was more sensitive and could exrss his feelings . ugh he says men are not suppose to be that way . whatever . ryan stiles dropped out of high school to pursue comedy , he's on who's line is it anyway ? right ?"
19164,"yes i think he i son that show . i see fhat in 1912 to 1952 arhcitecture , li6terature , painting , mjusic and sculpture were actua lo,lympic events . . . . wow !"
19165,wow ! i always thought the oympics were just sports . teh fda burned six tons o literature in an act of yus censorshipl . that's horrible .
19166,"that is horrible ! horible consideringa ll of the tree sthat ere cut down to make that paper fo the literature , and then it was just hurne d! our poor env9ronment ."
19167,hi how are you ? do you like shos ?
19168,i'm doing well thanks . i love shoes . they offesr a orm of protection and comfort but are also used a sdecoration fashion .
19169,"yes , i am quite partial to sjoes . i wear them frequnetly , both for comfort abd fashion . i think that they are a great invention ."
19170,ywah no doubt . 9 also think it's kind of fuhny how much shoes can vary in cost . from sandals to highend fashion shoes .
19171,"yeah , i heard that there are some old shoes that are much better than the ones made these days ."
19172,oh yeah . isn't it crazy to think that 5000 year olx shoes perform better than modern shoes . musth ave hazd more durbael materila .
19173,i bet they were well made because they had to last . one pair for your wholel ife . lol
19174,yeah that is pretty cool . another good trick is putting ry tea bags in smelly shoes or gym bags because tehy absorb the unpleasant odor .
19175,does that wordk ? my shoes can get pretty stinky . maybe two or three bags ? lol
19176,ha ha yeah that might justw ork . there was an nfl wide receiver named steve smith who left his cleats on the fielda fter 4very game to raise awarenes sfor homeless people without shoes .
19177,"that is a great gesture , to hlep people that we often forget about . i think moprea thletes should do that ."
19178,agree . i wish mofe players did tha5 . there is an nba player who promoted a line of shoes tht retail that 15 hew zs not paid to endorse the m. that is very rare .
19179,i wonder if those shoes were any gooe . why only 15 dollars ? seems lo w.
19180,it is hard to believe shoes costing that chap . hopefully ballet shoes re cheap ebcause hte dancers go through 4 pairs per week !
19181,i would probalby go through a dozen a week . i am a terrible dancer ! lol
19182,haha me too . i am a huge proponent of votng . not all men could vote at one time in the uk in 1918 .
19183,i wonder what the restrictionw as . men that hadt o fihgt and die for their countryc ould not vote ? seems wrong .
19184,yeah it seems very wrong . even astronauts vote from space !
19185,"i guess they have to b eallowed to vote . i wish that the govt made more of an effort for other votes . anyway , great chat !"
19186,"yes me too . people vote for eveything even renaming their garbage dump in austinm , tx lol . nice chtting with you too . have a good one ."

19194,yeah as well as oedipus when he was young
19195,yeah . d9d you know a judge once tried to ban science fiction ?
19196,yes oly because the novel had a black characte
19197,yes that is so sad buft i guess it was the 50s
19198,true . do you know why george rr martin does not like fictikon ?
19199,yeah he said thatf t is is a copyright infringement
19200,yeah . do you like comedies ?
19201,i lovet hem . have you heard of bromantic comedies ?
19202,"yes i have like the movie hangover , theya re too hillrious"

19212,"what ? ! that's a strange work uniform . i guesst he pilgrims would approve . they wore colorful clothing , not just white and black ."
19213,that is so bizarre ! every time you see pilgrims in movies and tv they seem to always be dressed in black .
19214,"a sober , dour people in film l but rather colorful in real life . i guess pople think they're lik ethe amish . i didn't know taht apple nad a line og clothee in the 80s . hwat ? !"
19215,i didn't know that either . you'd think you'd see some apple clothing for sale on ebay or something .
19216,a collector's item . i ebt it wo7ldn't be made in north korea .
19217,oh i know what you sre talking about there . i've heard about taht . they have a clothes line but tje labels say maee in china .
19218,that's pretty sneaky of htem . i tink there is some sort of embargo or sanctions on north korea . not supposed to do business with them .
19219,you're peobably right abouty that . have you heard thwt 5000 year old shoes are way better than any made today ?
19220,nowadays everything is throwaway . ckulnd't throw away shoes back then and buy a new pair . had to last a lifetime !
19221,true enough . nowadays ballet dancers go through 4 pair o fshoes i na week .
19222,i wonder how they would d with thos e5000 year ol dshoes .
19223,i imagine just o9ne a week ! i wonder if those old shoes smelled ? thee's all kinds f productz these days for shoe odo such as dry tea bags .
19224,but what kind of tea ? earl grey ? darjeeling ? ballet dancers can be quite picky abou6 the tea varieties .
19225,after worrying over wha tkijd of tea you have to orry over what kind of shoe . if you go high end they are made wjth expensive materials .
19226,it's a tricky balance between shoe cost and tea bag cost . i'm not savvt enough to reckon the calculation .
19227,haha ! you know what i think is nice ? i think it' snice that sone foobtall player leaves his shoes on the field after a game to make people aware of the homeless without shoes .
19228,i hop ethat people recognize the gesure . many o fus are lucky in ways thatw e dlon't know .
19229,i jope people notice . hiw name is steve smith . i think he should have reporters mention it during post game .

19242,"for sure , all great shows . did you ever watch green lantern the movie ?"
19243,"no miss that , do you know who took jack blacks pace ?"

19253,"hi , have your heard of j . r . r . tolkien ?"
19254,yes i have . i haven't read any of his literature . i have watched the moveis the hobbit and the lord of the rings though thata re based off of hisworks .
19255,"ok , i have seen lord o fthe rings as well . i didn't realize he was a poet though or a professor ."
19256,"i definitely did not know he wasa professor . there was actually supposed tob e a sequel to lord of the rings tha tj . r . r . tolkien wrote , but after 13 pages he baandoned it ."
19257,i bet it would have been gold if he had finizhed it . i guess it makes sense he was a close friend of c . s . lewis .
19258,that's really interesting . i wonder why tolkien was appointed a commanderof the order of teh british empire by the queen at the time .
19259,he was probably well liekd by the monarch .
19260,what kind of literature do you like to read ?
19261,"i ,like m9dern fictioh best though i would love to read the novels written tor the annual contest wh4re writers come up with the worst possible opening snetejce ."
19262,literature was an olympice vent from 1912 from 1952 . that might have been interesting to observe as wel; .
19263,true . i fihd it interesting that the fda burned 6 tons of literature because of xensorship .
19264,"yes , i wonder what it was that they thought they had to censor ."

19266,do yo9ul ike to read literature that has elemens of comedy ?
19267,yes i love to laugh and lovfe comefy .
19268,the origins of the term comedy are found in ancient greece .
19269,i can believe that . did you know that comedy central has cancelled more than 1p0 shows since it started in 1989 ?
19270,"no m i wonder why that is . political satire is stilk big today . ion atjenina democracy , voters'; opinions were influenced by political satire performed by comic poets ."
19271,yeah the political stuff is mostly funny thoug hif does alienate audiences on occasipn .
19272,i think it also has a lot of influence in the modenf era on voters .
19273,true ! glod chat !
19274,nice to talk to you . i think i'm going to unwind with some lightc omedy shows right now .
19275,sounds like a plan !

19281,"i didn't know that ! mayeb i should give watching ig a shot . i heard that the supporting cast was pretty glod , but the main characters were lackin , so it's refreshing to heaqr an alternate view ."
19282,yeah check it out for ykurself very nice plot 9nto the next season as well . but i am a fazn of the originals thouyh .
19283,do they link discovery to any of the originals with kold characters or recurrign enemies ?
19284,"im telling you tyour going to love it , i don't want to give naything away and its online so you can watch the first season in it's entirety . do you watch netflix ?"
19285,i have a netflix subscription evers ince ic ut the cord on cable . so much cheaper ! is sdiscovery available o nnetflix ?
19286,i don't believed so but you can watch it on cbs . com . you know the reason why reed hasting created netfl8x ?
19287,just guessing bhased off personal experience was i tbecause cable was too expensive ?
19288,no it was because he had a late fwee from blockbuster if im nit mistaken .
19289,i was close ! it was about mondy after all . i wonder how much he's earne since he got inspired byt hat late fee .
19290,well threy have4 137 million tota lsubscribers wolrdwide and5 8 . 46 million in the us alone .
19291,"wow ! i've heard they're worth something like 2 billion , too . that would pay a lot of late fees , haha ."
19292,that's for sure ! from9 am to 12am netflix accounts f0or 33 percent of the badnwidth in north america .
19293,that's crazy . how muchb andwidth must they take up during their peawk hours during the day ?
19294,well them and youtube take hp half tghe peak hour traffic in north america .
19295,"that's amazing to think abou t. now that it's expsnded internationally , it's just goinbg to grow bigger , too ."
19296,yeah ims ur eblockbuster is kicking tjemselves for not purchasing it for a mere 50m . nice chatting with you .

19298,do you watch netflix ?
19299,hi ! i do watch and love netflix . i'm proud to say i'm one of the reasons netflix accounts for 33 percnt of all of north america's bandwidth from 9pm to 12am . ha ! what about you ?
19300,"me tlo , i ma currentl,y watching t right now lol . did you ever watch lilyhammer ?"
19301,"i can't say that i have . but i have watched star trek . in fact , i think it's funny that william shatner and carrie fischer had a star trekv s star wars fued going on that george takei tried to mitigate !"
19302,lol i nmever knsw that . lilyhammer was netflix'sf irst original show
19303,"that is awesome ! n3tflix has certainly come a long wahy over the years . and now today , both youtube and netflix account for half the peak internet traffic in north america ! that is wild , isn't it ?"
19304,i bet it5 does lol ! did you ever hear how netflix staryed ?
19305,"i heard it was because reed hastings eracked up a 40 late fee with awpollo 13 on vhsz , riguht ? it's a good thing that happened . ha !"
19306,yep it was apollo 13 at b.ockbusfer . now reed is laughing to the bank lol .
19307,"agreed ! and even more humilizting , blockbuster hd a chance to buy netflix for 50 million and today , the companyt is worth 2 billioj . that's kind orf sad . blockbuster missed out big time !"
19308,"ouch , they missed out huge ! i heard netflix is like 21b illion dolkarzs in debt because of all their new conteht . i 6hink it will be paid off quiicly though"
19309,hopefully so ! i do know they also spend 20 times more on postage than bandwidth as well ? i wonder if that couldb e a reasln why they're so far in debt as well ?
19310,"that is a good point , i wonder how many people actually get dvds deliverex to them still . i wonder hpw mch more money they could make if china was able to stream it"
19311,"that is a good question ! but not just china , also syria , crimea and borth korea . they already have 137 million subscriebrs , i can omly imagne how many million more they'd have ifn etflix was available in those coutnries !"
19312,"rjght , im ean chona has like the most people n this planet lol ! oh well , maybe sime day . back to your shatner comment before , are you a star wars or start rek fan"
19313,i'm probably more star trek . ha ! one of the reasons why is because ste;hen hawking is the first and only person to portray himself in the star tre kuniverse !
19314,"inferesting , i never really watched star trek . iu feel there were so many different versions , but i will definitley check it out"
19315,there defimitely is ! are you also a fan of scienc3 fiction by chance ? i am and i've been wanting tl read starehip troopers since it's the first scifi novel tol make the reading lists of three us military branches ! it must be a great book !

19320,"yes , i thought that was interesting as well . my son is an athlete and has smelly shoes ."
19321,wel; hten maybe that could help . steve smith leave his cleats after each game to raise awareness of homelessness . i did not know tha teither but i d0 not follow sports .
19322,"steve smith retired a fea years ago and i remember hearing about that . it is not well known , but i like that he is raising awareness ."
19323,"yes , it is a topi cthat needs awareness , s0 many people don't see the problem . i can not imagine spending thousands of dollars on one par of shoes ."
19324,"i cant' either , but it is capitaism at is best or worst . people can maek a lot of money and have the right to spend it as they wish ."
19325,yes they can . personally i would want to help others . . imagine the rip curl cpothing company makes clothing in n korea but rhe tags say china .
19326,i'm surprised . i have a rip curl swim shirt so i'm not too yappy to suport that company .
19327,"i was surprised to hear htat as well . i willh ave to researc thar more . apple had a clothing lin ein 1986 , i did not know that either ."
19328,i didn't know that about apple as well . i don't remember seein any apple branded clothing bafm then . i find it interesting that there is a store in alaabma selling unclaimed baggage from air0orts .
19329,no i do not recall seeing apple clothing then either . i also found the store in alabama selling unclaimed baggage . i would guess they have to wait some before getting this fron airports but i do no tknow .
19330,i'm surprised it is only in alabama . why alabama ? you would think there would be tores in all states .
19331,i was thinking teh samet hing . perahps it will catch on in other areas . think it is great how kohnny depp travels with his ajck sparrow costums so he can visit kids in hospitals .
19332,"it is good that johnny derpp does that . you hear negativ news about him , i'm gladh e helps sick kids in tha way ."
19333,"absolutely , it is always good to hear something positive . especially when the media focuses on the negative so much . how about a job wearing a panda costume to rdseach pandas ?"
19334,that is interesting about panda researchers . i wonder what the reaso nis for them to do that .
19335,"maybe it has somethig to do with not wanting the pandas to get used to humans or ;erhaps the researchers think the pandas will act different . sean bean is scared of flyig , so am i lol ."
19336,lfying is the safest form of travel . i travel for work so i fly all the time .t here was a jodie foster movie where sean bean is a pilot so that is ironic .
19337,"wow , that is very interesdting that you travel for work ! interesting about tfhe movie wit hsean bean doing a movie as a pilotb ut yet it says he is sfraid of flying . you jusr never know . maybe he cahnged hiks feelings foir flkying over time ."
19338,"i prefer not to , but do enjoy visiting new cities and countri3s . i doubt6 any of the scenes was shot while flying for sean bean . interesing t read about facts about people ."
19339,it must be wonderful seeing oth3r countries ahd cities . i love to learn about other places and people but i do it only by reading and listening to others who have gone travleing . be sare in yourf travels

19343,"hi , wow shoe with gps , taht sounds like too much ! i would like to get a 5000 year old pair of shoes . they do perform better than new one !"
19344,or mayve some of the original highheeled shows worn by persian cavalry soldiers in fthe 9th century .
19345,"0oor guys . . maybe il' ljust stay withb sandals , low cost , a simple sole and a strap ."
19346,"yes , high fashion show scosting hundreds or thousands o fdolars seem unnecessary to me ."
19347,tjat is true ! i learned a good tip for smelly shoes . . put dry tea bags inside them will absorb the odor !
19348,that's interesting ! another tip is to pay sojeone to break in your shoes to make tehm comfortable the way queen elizabeth does .
19349,"wow , i wish ic ould do that . lol . . .d id you kno who wmany pairs of pointe shoes ballet dancers use in a week !"
19350,"i'm sure it's a lot , since they're pojut under so muc hstress . did you know that bill nye actual holds a pat4nt for a type of pointe shoes ?"
19351,i did not know ! they can use up to 4 pairs of pointe shoes ! isn't that a lot ?
19352,"sound slike bill nye macde a solid invention investment , then ! another invention is actual asbestos clothing ; the greeks mad eit and it was al,ost as vluable as gold , at least until they figured out that asbestos costs outweigh its benefits ."
19353,that i slots o fceativity ! did you know had a clothing line ?
19354,"who did ? i do know that a bulletproof clothing mogul actually shoots his employeed to test and quality control his product , whch seems a bit extrem ."
19355,"wow i meant qpplehad a cloth8ng lone back in 19u6 . . . about the bulletproof test , taht is totally crazy !"
19356,"i guesst hey still have a chance to get into wearable tech , althouh ig doesn't seeml ike their watches are as hot o fan item as they used to be . some people like tradition ; for wxample , ther'es an african tribet hat still wears victorian clothes afyer haging adopted them when they were introduced by germsn ocdcupiers ."
19357,that is cute ! i wo8ld love to see that ! i found something interesting about a peculiar stor ein alabsma

19359,"lol , we are finding all sorts of crazy things ! wel lthis store sdells stuff found in unclaimed aggage in sirports !"
19360,"that's terrible ! i guess some peiple just get tired of waiting , so at least it's not going to waste in the airport . once a man wlr e70 items of clothimg i na chinese airport to avoid th ebvaggage caurge , although i guess he also could've been worried baoutt hem ending up lost haha"

19373,"i am surprised at how normal aome rockers are . however , they tend toward drugs muxch more than others . none o fthe beatles could read music . that us strange ."
19374,thats drazy ! the beatles have the best selling album of the 000's
19375,their musix is exellen even though their particular tenditions of it are not as good as that of many ater performers . you can go if this finishes it for you . byr
19376,i don't think it wi.l let me finish yet . lol . did you know the beatles song ' come togehter ' was written for timothy leary's 1969 california governor campaign
19377,no . i did not . i apologize for the bad advice . imagine ahving to stop touring because you ramplifi3rs cna't make you music louder than the screaming .
19378,"wow . . thats unreal , or a musicians dream . the fan love them lol beatlesd rummer ringo starr ws ilkiterate for most of his childhood because he missed three years of school due to tuberculosis and peritoitis"
19379,"i know tha tonly agent 1 can hit the 'done' button . eo , how about a ballet dacner wearing out 4 pairs of shoes in a week ?'"
19380,"its no tlit up yet . i didn't know that , that seems like a lot of money on shoes1"
19381,i know . however the materia lin those shoes seems flimsy . how about michael jacksonh owning a patent6 ?
19382,been good talking to you !
19383,did you know thes tate rock song of oklahoma is do you reaoize ?
19384,no idea . and never knew that elvis costelo was considerec punk rocm .

19392,wow . i never realized that the beatles broke up before any of them turned 30 . we think of them as so iconic and mature . guess not

19394,indeed . i'd like to find that webcam at abbey rd to see people stopping trffic to take recreationb photos . funny
19395,it i sstrange as famous as teh beatlesw ere they col dnot read music
19396,tahts crazy i am not sure anyone could get away with that now . th ebeatles used the word love i ntheir songs 613 times .
19397,that is a lot of times to use the word love . and it is crazy they stopped touring ebcause the amplification couldn't handle the women screaming
19398,yeah rock n roll exploded in the 50's . so much that the grammy awards were invemted to take attention away from it .
19399,did you knw professional ballet dancers go through 3 pairs of pointe shoes in a week
19400,i believe it ! i just saw that thefe are ballet slippers that make drawings from the dancers movements too .
19401,andt he beatles have the best sell8ng album of the 2000's . didn't the4y stop recording together way before that ?

19403,i think i tis neat that michael jackson had a patent on hid leaning mve
19404,cool . he couldn't patent the moon walk hecause it was done by a tap dancer named bill bailey in 1955 !
19405,i never would have gudssed that professiinal ballerinas go through so many shoes .
19406,that's nuts . i wonder 3hatt hey do with them after the fact . seems like a wast to toss that many .
19407,agreed . abllerina shoes are retty thimgs aren't they ? i guess they are always ripping tears in them .
19408,maybe stephon marbury can bring his starbury line back wit hrecycled ballet slippers .
19409,maybe . the thing that actually stuck out tom e most in th3se sectons was the johnny depp hing . is that actually true ? are peop.e still that big of a fan of the jack parrow cahracter ? lol
19410,i feel like that'a probably true like 5 years ago . it seems like something eh wkuld have done before he hit a wall and lost hie way . who doesn't love jack sparrow ! !
19411,"never seen any of the pirates movies so i guesds i don't love jack sparrow lol i do like johnny depp though . other than the panda researdcher thing his costuems are the only interesting thing in that costume secrion . well , maybe labyrinth but i have not seen that movie e8ther . . ."
19412,"if you've ever got time on your hands pirates is great mindx numbing fodder . can't takr it too seriously though , too much eyeliner . teh panda thin gactually made me laug hout loud . the mental vishal is too much . i wonder how long they hang out in hte jungle ibn a panda suit ? it's got to be soooo hot ."
19413,"teh panda thing makes me uncomfortb.le .l ike you said , being in the heat or even wore with terrilbw humidity . i guess pandas feel threatened or scared by humans or something ."
19414,taht's major commitm3nt to research . i commend them for that . it kind of creeps me out that the cast of firelfy has to wear usedc ostumes . . .
19415,firefly was that show with one season correct ? i had no idea anyone in that show ould wear costumes . i assumed they were just blandly dressed actors like every other show .
19416,i've never seen it . it jusf seems weird to wear stuff that other people sweat in .
19417,i never watched it either . surely they washed them a few times . are starship toopers a star ytrek thing ?
19418,"starship troopers i've seen . it's this really bad late 90's scifi movie wit hcasper van dien , denise richards anc doogie howser ."
19419,"that sounds wful . doogie howser md ? oh , and going back to swea5 for a minute you could always step into hfe sweat from the gods i you ear the 5000 year old shoes ."
19420,it's pretty brutal . the cheese factor is on wnother level . . . kind of like 5000 yewr o0ld toe cheese of th egods . . . see waht i did there ?
19421,like howard the duck ? 5000 year old toe cheese makes me hungry .
19422,"wooooooooow ! howard the duck ! taht is slme serious old school cheese , but yes , it's totally on that level ! ! ! cheese is always a great snack . especially if it's spicy"
19423,what cheese is spicy ? pepperjack ? lol
19424,"pepperjack , habanero havarti . . . i like to chop up jlaa;ens and mix it in cream cheese and use it as fillingb for jaoapeno poppers . nlow i'm hungry ."
19425,i have no idea what habanero havarti is . now i want to go eat w stuffed pepper and watch crap movies instead of being 9n the internet lol

19441,i'm not sure . did you know the fda burnerd six tons of literature ?

19443,"interesting , i wonder how 5recent ?"
19444,me too .k issing is kind of strange cojcept if you think about it too hard .
19445,there as once a contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel .
19446,i wonder what some of them said . i'm sure3 some of them were pretty funny .
19447,yeah they probably were . winston churchill won a nobel prize in literature .
19448,that's interesting . painting was an olympic event in 1912 .
19449,i can believce that . sounds like it would be cool to wathc . nie chatting wit hyou .
19450,"hello , do yo watc hstaqr tek ?"
19451,i love it . i grew up on the older shows like the original series abd the next generation . what about you ?
19452,"i dont really watch it . i have seen a few episodes though . i recently learned some stuff about it ; like , teleportqtion was used because it cost too much to get shots of spaceshils anding lol"
19453,"really ? ha , to think it set off such a trend in science fiction of teeportation devices . i bet they made a lot of money on that mon3ysaving decision ."
19454,"i know right , and who ever thought of that was so creative , just to swave money ! ! ! amazing !"
19455,it's pretty amazing how big the franchise has grown too . i doubt gene roddenbsrry ever knew how big his original tv show idea would grow .
19456,i hear stephen hawking is the only one to play themseves in star trek .
19457,"he earned it with his amazing scientific research . i didn't know he'd been ij star trek , though . i wondser whic hof the series he was in . there were so many !"
19458,do you watch netflix ?
19459,"i have a subscription , but i don' twatch it muc h. do you ?"
19460,"yeah i use it w lot . love th edervice . apparently , they spend more on post5age than bandwidth lol"
19461,"that's surprising . it must be worth it , though , considering they're worth over 2 billion nos ."
19462,"yeah , i cant elieve blockbuster turned down an offer to buy them . i remember them starting their own service , obviously it failed ."
19463,"blockbuster made the same mistake a few compajies have , turning down a chance at th online markewt and not realizibg that everyone is going digital ."
19464,"yeah , guess a ;ot of companies misreqd how much convenience was worth . the tech boom camea round pretty faxt ."
19465,"yeah , it wzs a short leap from sciencef iction to reality for a lot of newer technologieds . i doubt it'll be long before netflix cuts back on their physical disc rntal s4rvice and goes solely to streaming ."
19466,"i agree , plus its costing them money ."
19467,"they probably still make money off ther entals , just not a smuch as off digital cotnent . if the rentals wer4 an actual negative , htey'd habe ut them out alreay ."
19468,i hear that netflx an dyoutube make up half of peak internet trafvic in nort amerdica !
19469,"imagine how mnay people must be tuned in ar once ! tehy've gone internaional too , so i wonder how much it is all across the globe ."
19470,weriously ! that is a lot of peo0ple . youtube has so much content !
19471,google was smart ti buy youtube when they did . it was a much better decision than blockbuster made aboug netflix !
19472,"hello , do you like start rek ?"
19473,"hello . i am not , but i heard r . martin luther king was really into it . i keep meaning to watch the new one , o ncbs . i'm a fan of sonequa martin green , she left the walking dead for this new series ."
19474,oh i see . well star trek seems to be influentila that the first space shuttlew as named qfter tbe ship in teh series
19475,was it ? i never knew that . i was surprised to ear that king abullah of jordan had a nonspeaking role on it at one time .
19476,"did not know that , pretty coo l. hawking was the only prson that actually portrayed himself in it"
19477,"sterphen hawking ? that's awesome . he was a great mind . i saw a documetnary on him ' the theory of everything ' , on netflix a while ago . i think that's the only thing i watched twice . well , tghat and the fireplace ."
19478,"he was amazing . speaking of netflix , do you mknlw how that business gots tarted ?"
19479,"i do not . i do know that hey offered blockbuster th echance to buy the company , and htey turned it down ."
19480,"yes that was nhot a smart decision , they could have bought it for only 50 millio nand make billions now"
19481,very true . i would love toh ave the job of ' tagger ' for netflix . i can watch t . v . all day and tagc ontent .
19482,iw ould love that tol honestly . they spend a lot on bandwidth but still spend even more n postage
19483,"very true . it's fascinating that tgey monitor the markets in europe , to see which shows are piratedd the most , sol they can purchase tem ."
19484,"wow , did not know that . but if seems now netflix makes up half of the peak traffic in north aemrica"
19485,"i believe it . i was wsthcing a movie on kit the other night , based o na bradbyry bovel . i was surprise dto learn that he wrote the script for epcot's spaceship earth ."
19486,cool . do you enjoy reading science fiction ?
19487,i do . bradbury is a favgorite of mine . i recently read enders'g ame . have you seen the movie ?
19488,no i have not actually . but i heawrd that sgarship trooper is recommended 4even by military branches

19490,"wow , i cannot 8magine that . do you know how the word robotics wa scoined ?"
19491,"i do not , do you ?"
19492,it was an accident by isaac asimov back in 1941 . thahks for the chat
19493,"hello there , did you know that scientists in italy do checkups and ice treatments on this man who died 5 , 300 ywars ago ? imagine that !"
19494,"wow , that is crazy . the ejperor of japan apparently is a scientist and still publishing . what a uy"
19495,really ? two rokes for one person he must be very busy . another scientist who has two careers would be harrison schmitt . he is the only scintist to walk on the moon !
19496,that is pretty cool . good for him . another scientist was able to divide two 8digt numbers at the ag eof 6
19497,"i can barely even divide 7 . that person must have got into harvard . speaking of harvard , did you knowt hat hsrvard scientists managed to store an animation of a gallopong horse onto the dna of a bacteria ? i round that really fascinating ."
19498,wow that is pretty advanced and souynd intrkguing .? do you know how www was invented ?
19499,i believe that it was invented by an english scientist in 1989 . that scientist was working in switzerland . do you know anymore details on how it was invented ? i am really curious tp know .
19500,"just a bit like , he was working for cwrn which is a european statefunded organization that does research"
19501,really ? that is prettyh cool . i found it very interesting tha a store in alabama only sells items found in unclaimed baggage at the airport .
19502,"that is somethin g, i would like to check thqat out at some point . even apple had a clothig line back i nthed ay"
19503,that is the same as how amazon used tob e an online book retailrr . it's hard to imagine ho wmuch tyhat they have grown over these few decades .
19504,"that is true , they are a giant now . do you know when 0ilgrims wear black cothes ?"
19505,"no i did not know that ! furthermore , rip curl is a company that manufactures in north koreab ut labels it as made in china ."
19506,hahah go figure . do you know how fashion aficionados can tell if you need your clothes tailored ?
19507,"interesting . speaking of fashion , did you know that british politicians had to wear a op if when they made a point on the house oc commons ? this was mandatory up until 1998 !"
19508,that iss trange to me but k guess it wokre dfor them .d o you know how the tipping oft he hat origianted or .
19509,did it originate fromk nights raising theit visors in order to show friendliness in the battlefield ?
19510,yes that was it . do you know whic has the most famkus hat in the old west ?
19511,"i am not sure , but i do know that the part7 yat was derived from dunce caps ."
19512,nice . the mostf amous one 2as the boeler cap nad not the cowboy hat as we are leadt o believe
19513,"ah , so that i what 9it was . ih the past hat's were used t indicate social status . i am glad that we have evolved from that ."
19514,i am very glad about that too . nice chatting !
19515,do u like science
19516,i do . . l i try to keep up with all tats going on in the science wo9rld the bet i can
19517,there are scinetists who theorize tha tuniverses evolve through natural selection much like different species do on earth .
19518,how do you think sll this climate change jis going to aff4ct the universe as a whole more so than just earth ?
19519,idont believe in it
19520,do you believe in newton and kepler's research work into how the planet works ?
19521,no im a flat earthier
19522,really ? that is interesting . i didn't ahnyonhe still had that opinion anymor3 given all the evidence we ahve now .
19523,all of mnasa images are cgi there ot real and cojmon sense and simple science says it sflat
19524,i wish i coulf get on one o fthe pdiate space missions and sde for myself nad mayeb see how truy cold a star actually is
19525,im a hardcore bible believer and according to descriptions given we live inside of a snow globe type structure the ancients jews also believed this
19526,so you agree with the hologram tneory then ?
19527,i aree with multiple dimensions yes
19528,"i myself am not a big believe in the bible , no offense ."
19529,thats ok i wont hold it against you lol but i do encourage it bexcause ifn ohting else there is lots of unknown science in it
19530,i agrer with you there . the bible is the worlds best book
19531,"did you know in psalms david described the stars singing but it wasnt until recently our scientist figured it out , and laso did you know that when dr scheck your blood to find oyut your diseases it sbc one dr learne dtheb ible said the the life of the flesh is in the blood"
19532,"i had not realized that until now . i thought it was common knowledge , basivc sdience from prehistoric days"
19533,i have alot more but i watn get into that im kind of a nerd baout these thing
19534,do you like the old or new testament better ?
19535,both are equal thanks havge a good day
19536,hlelo . have you ever heard ofa kihito ?
19537,the japanese emperor ? yeah .
19538,i recently learned that he is a scientis6 and stillo publish3s papers even though he is emperor .
19539,tha's cool . he probably viewed haing to take on the job of emperor as a burden that kept him ftom living the wa he wanted .
19540,he just might have at that . did you know tuhat the term scintist was coined by a theologian and philosopher ?
19541,"not unti.l just now . i kne it was caleld ' natural philosophy ' until recenfly , but not who was esponsible for the change ."
19542,"yeah , william whewell did it in 1833 . i wou,d have thought someones pecializing in science would have come up with it ."
19543,i guess a lot of name efor things have q lot of weird origins . i wondrw ho came up with the idea for ' project steve . '
19544,waht isw project steve ?
19545,it's a project of scientists wh all support evolution and oppose teaching creationism but they have to be named steve !
19546,serio9usly ? how odd ! i think another odd thing as fhere was only one scientist on the moon .
19547,"i guess that stand sto reason . i figured they were all career air forc epilots , given the way the space program recruited ."
19548,tru . it's a shame though . i imagine there was a whole host of scientists wanting to go up there .
19549,yeah . zt least the sp0ace shuttle made getting into space a lot easier for civilians of all typexs .
19550,"i hope one day it is affordasbel for all of us . maybe it'll be like th einternet , slow to starrt but now fast and highly accessible ."
19551,"yeah , if tyey ever build a space shuttle tog et peopl eout of earth's gravity wel;l cheaply , space will be accessible to a lot more people ."
19552,"i'm putting my money on elon musk . then again , the internet was inventeed by an englishman so you never know ."
19553,"musk has demonstrated thatl ow cost teh is possible , but i hope that it's open siurce and p2p projects that acthlaly take the principle and run with it rather htan a corporation ."
19554,"hmm , i hadn't thought of that . i'd like that too . then harrison schmitt won't be the only scientist on them oon ."
19555,"i remember seeing a science fivtion story abou an opensoutce moon project called open shot . there was a contest tos ee who could accomplish the first nongovernjent moon landing and mosf of the competitors were corporate , but the winber wa sa spacecdraft called the stallman ."
19556,well a longt ime ago 5here was a short lived tv serie sabout a jan who built a ship in hi sbackyard and took trips to space .
19557,have you heard any news about scientists lately ?
19558,something about dna of bacteria being stored in w gif aniamtion . you ?
19559,"harrisom schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon , but they are planning to put a base statin on thd moon soon ."
19560,"i wonrer hiw htey aee going to do that , snce no one has been to the moon since the 70's ' maybe the emperor of japan knows , as he still publishes papers ."
19561,"i am not sure , but it was not really tha6 long ago , i mean , the world wide web was invented in 1989"
19562,it has been almost 0 years sinc qnypne stepped on the moon . thats a lon gtime . even by cern's standards .
19563,"look how far we came in that time , an iphone has more computing power thnan anything they had back then , we can do it , apple had a clothing line in 1986 but now is so powerfu lof a company"
19564,fascinating . i think it's hilar8ous that people ntink that thec owboyh at was modt popular in the old west . it was really the bolwer .
19565,cowboy hats are so cool and most peopled don't know much about them plus . the tipping of a hat goes back to knights raising of their face masks .
19566,"yes , they did that to show they were friend,y ."
19567,"eactly , i bought a really nice hat at the unclaimed baggage store in alabama , have you ever heard of it or been ?"
19568,i ahve been ntere . i bought a caera anfd most of my mardi gras outfits thedre several years ago . it's huge . i even found a vintage apple sweater .
19569,"wow , that's a great find . we bought nmice luggage there and a computert here"
19570,"i'm srprised they checked a computer . in 198 , a law w2as passed , eegulating the length of hat pins ."
19571,"in ever thought that suffragetts would use tehm as weapons , surely they had other options ."
19572,"i would have , had i of lived bnack then . there was zero reasons why we couldn't vo5e , and some men were very violdent towards is . i found out that tghe hats bihsops wear , are called mitres . that's a weirf nae ."
19573,"that is a weird nake , i huess it was a lot different bakc then , until 9198 brittish poliicians had to wear a top hat if making an order"
19574,"people always think that pilgrims only wore black . they were fashion forward , and only wore it for specizl occasions ."
19575,"they were good at makign clohtes , i like how a coller gap can tell if you et clothes tailored"
19576,only those truly schooled in fashion and stle are able to tell that with0ut asking .
19577,"the clotbes were better bac kthne too , unlike the stuff made in china with a made in korea label"
19578,"rip furl is a north korean label , and is legallt not for sale due to sanction s.s o , that hardly qualifies ."
19579,"bye , have a great day !"
19580,"thank you , you too"
19581,"1954 was a ,ong tie ago . a lot had occurred around thatt ir ."
19582,"albert einstein wrote hte letter tow a philosopher in 1954 , that went into the public auction in 2008 ."
19583,i bdlieve the end of wwii was fresh on everyone's mind . its interesting that young albert was devou t.
19584,"yes , after the second world war we need peace and human shnould respect human . love id the greatest gif tto kan kind ."
19585,"the letter sold in 2008 for 404 , 000 . if the letter wa swritten by some one other than albert it woupd never have gotten so much . vanilla ice , 1 . obama , 1 , 000 ?"
19586,"it is very unteresting . the post in 1985 , einstein belueved in what he called a cosmic religion ."
19587,"yes , i do not think that einstein thought no god at all , bu trather a pat f the universe that is difficutl to understand . i think he was criticizing religiousl eaders on some points ."
19588,there are stars in the known universe that are cold enough to be touched by the huamn hand .
19589,you firs6 . te density of the astar would be such that your not getting your hand back . the bservable universe is filled with wondroust hings .
19590,there is a region of space that may be pulling galaxies outsjide the observable univers e.
19591,"the heliocentric model of hte sola rsysyem was a bad idea ; flat earthersg o a step to far . w eshould never have come ou t6of the trees . if we coudl travel to this region of space , would you ?"
19592,yes i also . the big bang theory i sthe prevailin gcosmological explosion is the development of the earth .
19593,"well , ok i guexs . i wonder if albert einstein charved 1 to sign his 404 , 000 letter ."
19594,thd letter showed upa gain on ebay for an asking price at least 3 million but apparently never sold .
19595,"ind ecember of this year , it will be auvtioned by christie's . they expect 1 million . if i had a millioin , there are other things . still it would be interesting ."
19596,what is that thing ?
19597,"the other thngs ? for a million ? i dont know ,e xperiences are the best . travel to south amerifa and see hte rain forest . the estate of einstein earns 18 , 000 , 000 annually ,"
19598,"albert einstein was asked to be the president of isfael , which he was declined . do you know ?"
19599,i imagine such a presidency would present a moral iasue for the man . he was abou5 fair and equal treztment for people . he was a member of naacp .
19600,i think that we would understand esch other quite well if we taljed about the concrete things .
19601,"yes , e os mc2 and 2 plus 2 equals 5 . have a good day ."
19602,"hi , how are doing this fine evening ?"
19603,"good , how are you doing ?"
19604,i'm great ! what do you know of hte amn albert einstein ?
19605,"his estate is still earning over 18 , 000 , 000 each year ! nice !"
19606,i wonder what they do with the money . he charged 1 to sign his autograpb . he donated all th9s money to vcharity .
19607,hopefully some of it still goes to charity . he was a member of thr naacp .
19608,he was an interestin gguy . he wanted to help others . he declined the oftfe rro be president of israwl . i guessh e wasn't attracted to power .
19609,a letter that he wrote rejecting god and religion will be placed up for auction .
19610,he probably sawt he problems with religion and the divisions taht it can create . i wonder what he wrote on the message he put int he time capsule .
19611,i guess we just have to wait a few thousand years to find out ! bhaha . he ssid that god is a product of human weakness .
19612,we want to believe that there is a being that looks out for our well being . we hold this belief despite no evidence . i like jefferson's idea of a bible without the miracles .
19613,"i do believe in god because i have felt things that cannot be explained . einsteib did however b4lieve that there is a lot in the physical universe that is a mystery . he often wrote of god , but for him , this was the universe itslef ."
19614,"i provably favor his thinking more than hat o freligions . many things aren ot yet e4xplained , but i worry that people will divide themselves over how they choose toe xplain the unexplained . it's interesting that it wa snot uncommonf or students in the us to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education ."
19615,"i agree , it does divide . einstein did also say that he felt religion was necessary to guide peole between what was right and w4rong ."
19616,"moral defisions are difficult , and it helps to have a welldeveloped codet hat can guide a conmunity . teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams are the only two us presidents that did not use a bile at their swearingin ceremonjes . i wonder what ethics thsy used as their guide ."
19617,"hmm , interesting . i wonder too . einstein believed taht people can understand each oth3er quite well if theut alk about oncrete things ."
19618,"it?s easier to find common ground with the concret e. physics examines the concrete , yet i think einstein knew that it was not enough to explain ljfe to human beings ."
19619,"yes , tnere is still disagreemenet even among physicists baout where the univerwse came from ."
19620,"not knowing everythign keeps life interesting . anyway , i enjoyed chatting !"
19621,"yes , enjoy life . you only get one ! nicxe chatting !"
19622,have a good one !
19623,how is your univrse today ?
19624,my universe is great how was yours ? i'm thankful for the ancient greeks and indian phi.losophers who started to gain knowledge about our universe .
19625,atlhough they were geocentric
19626,yes that'a riht . more precise observations were made b copernicus who developed the hleiocentric model .
19627,"yes , and isaac newton built upon his theories developing the law pf gravitation"
19628,yes he did as well well as tycho brahe and johannes keppklers laws of planetary motion .
19629,did you now there 4re scientists that thin the universe evolved through natural selection ?
19630,i think that is very interesting to compare our universe to the animasl here on earth .
19631,"i am a ,it5le unclear on the theory as there is only oje univers that wew know so how is natural election involved ?"
19632,yes it's based on evidence such as fossils . another theory suggests that the universe may exist inside a blackhole .
19633,how abou tthe theoryt here is only one electron in thw universe ?
19634,yes i don't understand that theory at all . it is so easy to provew rong . if you could fold a piece of oaper in and half 103 times it aould be a thick as the observable universe . ard to picture that one .
19635,wow . what about htat is one giant superhologram ?
19636,"i've4 actually never heard that one ? i don't even understanx it really . apparently the deepest note in the universe is emitted by blackhole , producing a notd 57 octaves below middle c ."
19637,whoa . . . . there are stars that are cold enoug ht9o tou8ch !
19638,"i would love to to8ch a star . speaking of cold , there's a cild spot in the cosmic microwave backgrond thath as been theorized to be a link to a parlalsl universe ."
19639,"wow , scary . einsteins god was the universe itself !"
19640,yes you are right . eh was a genius . he released his special theory of relativity at age 26 .
19641,way ahead of his time . . . passed away in 1955 . good chat and take care .
19642,yoda from star wars was actually modeled aftef teh appearance of albert einstein . have a great day nice chatting with you too .
19643,"yes , you too ."
19644,"hi hows it goin g? do y9u like interesting facts about computwr s? i rezd recently that the spac eshuttles computer run on like 1mb of ram ! isnt that crazy , must be a slow computer ."
19645,"wow that is slow , htis says in 1936 the russians made a computer that ran on water l sounds cool atually"
19646,"wow thats beyond me , i have no clue how that wojld even work lol"
19647,"no me netiher ! also that smoking near apple computers voids th ewarram5ty , i know a lot of people at work that wouldn't like to know that"
19648,"thats eem odd that smoking would void yh ewarranty , so many people smoke !"
19649,"i know it's weird ! i gues it says i'ts a iohazard , but i'v enever heard of that with anu other product"
19650,just seems weird for a fomluter warrantyl o. did you read that trqnshumanist wnt to save tbeir minds oh computers ? it sound like an episode of black mirror lol
19651,"ha it does , it does sound kind of awesome though , i need to watch that one episode of black miror i think i've ead about it , this says the seahorse is the only fish to have a neck , that seem scrazy"
19652,"thats weird , i never knew that . i didnt know that freshwater fish drink through their skin , thats pretty amazing !"
19653,"nope didn't know taht , , or that saltwater fish drino through yteir mouth , i wonder i tehy ever get tired of a salty taste or if they're just so used to it they don'6 notioce hayha"
19654,lol i wonder if the salt makes their moth dry ? hahah
19655,"hah aya good question ! htis says 84 percent of human genes associated with diseases have c0unterparts in zebrafish , we need to get rid of those genes haha"
19656,"whoa ! htats wqeird . did you know there is a type ofj ellyfis and a type of loster that are immortal ? i fnog killed of course , but tehy can literally live forrverrrr r!"
19657,"that is weird they nee dto put those genes inside me somehow haha , or that the black swallowe rfish can eat prey twice it slength , i can eat that much pizza myself"
19658,"wow , you ca neat twice gour length in piza ? thats crazy , you zshould be entering in some conteset of something !"
19659,"haha i should , i would be a great professional eater , the only problem is the weight gaina fterwards i'd have to not eat for a week haha"
19660,oh thats yrue ! gptta go on ad iet after every contest lol
19661,"that's the other reason that i need the immortal jellyfish genes inside me , so i can eat my weight in pizza everyday and not die prematurely haha"
19662,"haha that would be perfect for you ! i have no idea hoq yo8 eould do tha6 though , i think you need to make friends with a scientist or something lol go on meetup and join one lf yhose vroups ."
19663,"haha yes i will develp an immortal jellyfish gormula ! jackie chan probably has access to it considering the stunts he does , also he manages a kpop badn apparently"
19664,wow tha sinteresting . do you like k pop ?
19665,"can'rt say i've ever listened to it no , i should give it a try i do like most music , what abou5 you ?"
19666,"yeah somewhat . there is a band caleld bts ,t hey are the most popular k pop band right now , they were doing a tour around the states , i keep seeing them on talk shows so i checked ou6 their music , pretty tooe . they have one song with nikki minaj too !"
19667,"wow i actually do like nicki minaj , i'll have toc heck them out , this say snorth koreza has a kpop hgirl band which i sthe most popular in the coumtry"
19668,"haha right . hey its been fun chatting , have a good one !"
19669,"hi , do you use the computer a lot ?"
19670,hi . yes i do l i use irt basically all day for all sorts of differdn tthints . it's hard to believe that computers were originally just calculating devices .
19671,yeah htey have come a very long way
19672,"yhey realy have . i mean , think about it . the ussians hae made a computer that runs on water !"
19673,that is amazing . and htes lace shuttle computerr uns on only 1 mb of ram
19674,"does it really ? that is very surprising . it's hard to be.ieve that co,puters lal started from a ximple prog5am , a command to a machine ."
19675,yeah it is for sure . do yu have an apple or a pc
19676,i have a pc . i am not rea lbig on apple products . i've heard they can be problemat6ic . do you have an apple or a p ?
19677,i have an apple . gopopd thign i do not smoke as i would void its warranty
19678,lol ! i remember hearings omethinga bout that before ! isn't smoking around an apple considered z biohazard ?
19679,"yeah it is , i think that is what voidw the warranty . crazy"
19680,that i scrazy . it's just as crazy as some people hoping to uploa their minds to computers and emmory sticks .
19681,"yeah , not sure jow transhumanists are going to do that but it will gbe interesting to se"
19682,"i agre4e . maybe they should start with something smaller to experiment with first . something like a fish perhaps . then again , maybe they should atudy jellyfish . there's a breed of them that is immortal ."
19683,yeah they have been doing that for a while now but cannot crack their code
19684,"really ? i didn'tk now that ! i guess fish are more complicatex than they see m. i mean , even the way they drink is different . fresh water drink y oxmosisa n dsalt water through their mouths ."
19685,yeah that is so cool how they have adapted . there are fiesh that eat prey twice their size .
19686,"i wondedr how they do thyey do that . now that i think ov it , fish don eed to be stydied more . the ebra fish has genes that are associated with human diseases ."
19687,"yeah , and they are often studies to figure out things about humans , there are lots of studies ."
19688,i like that fish can communicate . they use use acoustic communication which depenfs on the size and species of the fish ?.
19689,yeah that is reallyc oo . nice chat

19756,"how'xs it going , are you a big basebal lfan ? in canada they clal kickball soccerbasenbal,"
19757,i loveb aseball . did you know that managers wear uniforms becauset hey ould literally play for their team if they wante ?
19758,i didnt know that was why the wore uniforms but i've heard of managers playing in games before
19759,are you a fan of either the yankees or red sox ?
19760,"yea i'm a yankees fans , it's pretty cool they were known as the highlanders before 1913"
19761,so you must've heard about the two yankees that swappsd families ? that's a bit weird .
19762,"i actually haven't , pretty weir dto swap families , i wondered if they nicknamed the team"
19763,ha ! yankee player sand fans are an interesting bunch . bill o'reilly created a fake press organization in college just so he could get seson tixkets .
19764,"that's pretty smart , toob ad o'reilly's idea wouldn't work nowadays"
19765,how do you feel about the red ox ? did you know taht hey're partially owned by the new york times ?
19766,"that is quite ioic . it's pretty funny the red sox cant win a game kn ben afflecks' birthday , guess hes bad luck"
19767,his patriots eem to be doing justf ine though . the red sox have still won 9 vchampionships too .
19768,"that's not too bad , i never knew there was another boston yeam called the red stockings , that city s4ems obsessed with feet"
19769,"yeah , they changed their name because their manager thought red dye was dangerous ."
19770,"that's preyty odd , did you know the first game at fenway was against the new york highlanders ?"
19771,who ? i rememjber hearing about them not being able to defnedt heir 1903 championship ebcause the other team didn't watn to play
19772,"that is strange , i wonder whu the new york giants refused to play the red sox in the workd series"
19773,why do you thini they did ?
19774,"i have no clue , maybe the ny giants lost to them the previous year on bad calls and were protesting"
19775,maybe they were mad that bobby richardson won a world seris mvp even thouhg he lost the series
19776,"well i got to go , nice talking with you"
19777,are you a fan of baseball ?
19778,"i know a little bit about what is going on , but to say i was a fan would b estretchijngt he truth ."
19779,did yu know that in 1973 2 yankees pitcherd swapped families ?
19780,swapped famopies ? is thats ome kind of baseball term 9'm not familiar with ?
19781,"no , they switched famioies ."
19782,htat mus5t have made an aawkward dressing room . so who's this lost ankees player ?
19783,"yeah , it sxeems prettyw eird . did you know a player got suspended for refusing to get a haircut ?"
19784,"it seems a bit extreme , but i guess i should see his hair before passing judgement . what i fvind interesting is that the new york times owns part of the boston team ."
19785,"yeah , it was don mattingly ,a t the time he played firast base ."
19786,"i know there is a nig rivalry betw4en oston and new york , it would sacrilege for a ne wyork business to hav ean interest in a boston team ."
19787,the red sox have lost every gwme on afflecks birthday since goodwill hunting was released .
19788,"i'm aware ghat affleck is a big boston fan , i wonder how he feels about taht . i think , aside fro mtaht , his team has done fairly well these past years ."
19789,i'm not sure . did you see the movie goodwill hunting ? i thought it was good .
19790,"my wife liks it , i have not seen it . i hear the owners of the boston team own othe fsports teams around the world ."
19791,"ijteresting , it wouldn't surprise me , but i'm noy sure that it isn't a dconflict of interest ."
19792,i suppose as long as the teams don't compete actively with one another it should be fine .
19793,ineresting . did you know a man found 3 million in baseball cards in his grandfathers attic ?
19794,"i should go and visit mine , see if ther eis anything hidden up there . who would have thought some simple cards could be worth so much ?"
19795,"i uwed to have a baseball card collection , i should check and see what it is woirth ."
19796,"do you have an ozzie albies card , or is he too new of a player ?"
19797,"no , i don't . i only have cards from the 80s . nice chatting with you !"
19798,"hello . it's oddt hat baseball manzgers are also part of the team , and can play if they are needed ."
19799,"that is very odd inceed ! i also find it odd that no palyer has ever attempted to catch a bzll with his hat . but if htey do , the opposing team reveivews three freeb ases so perhaps that's why ."
19800,that's very wejrd . so is the term ' soccer bseball ' .
19801,ha ! i've never heard thsat one before ! but i have heard of the alburquerque isotopes minor league team tjat was named after a team in the simpson's ! ha !
19802,"weirdly , the new york timew are partial owners of the boston rdd sox ."
19803,"is that so ? that's kind of ironic , ixsn't it ? i o know that lebron isa lso a member of the group that owns the red sox as well as f cliverpool !"
19804,yeah . ;ebron is nto a lot of things . too bad he has an atttude simce moving to la . i wonder where the ' lost ' yankee player is ?
19805,i'm n0t sure of that one ! but did you know ben afflsck force3d the gone girl produjction to shut down for 4 days because he refused to wear a new york yankees cap on screen ? he's a huge red sox fan . that's going overboard and taking it way too far .
19806,"actors and other celebse are so peculiar . bil lo'reilly had a fake press organization in college to get seasonb tickets to the yankees , it worked ."
19807,ha ! so true ! i do think it's cool that wrigley and fenway are the only two ballparjks that are over 100 years old .
19808,are they ? wow . i guess don mattingly was wuspended because he didjn't watn to cut his hair . how 3eird .
19809,that is weird . kind of liek bobby richardson is the only player to win world series mvp despite adctuallyl osing the series .
19810,many japanese are surprised to hear thatb aseball is poouaor here .
19811,are they really ? i wonder why ? i also wonder if japan's pro baseball league uses as many balls as the mlb in a single season which is 160k .
19812,"maybe ? i think i would prefer the n . y highlanders , over the ny yankees ."
19813,"speaking of the yankes , did you know their amous logo predates the team ? it was actually designed by tiffany and co . for a medal of valor for a fallen police officer , john mcdowell , way back in 1877 ."
19814,"yes , i did . i have a book on tiffany histlry . if i were to find a box of baseball cards , i would throw them ou t, unlike fhe man who foubd millions in his grandfather's attic ."
19815,ha ! i need t hceckm y attic then ! i wonder if a card exists on the 17 year old girl who was banned from baseball for strikign out both babe rutu and lou gehrig ?
19816,"ho;efully , she is a national treasure . weirdly , two yankees pitchers swapped families . pemranently ."
19817,"i wonder why ? that's kind of strange ! do you tinka ny cubs fans swapped families the last time they won back to back world serkes titles , wh9ich happened to be the last time they won a series ?"
19818,"i don't know . thank you for chatting wiht me , have a wonderful dah ."
19819,"nice chatting with you ! and beforer i o , alwayd remember the yankees don't put the player'z last names on 6he back of their jersdys because they feel it puts unneeded attention on the players when the attention should be on tbe team as a whole . take care , friedn !"
19820,hi there ! are you a baseball fan at all ?
19821,hello ! i am ! i dnt' real.ly have a team but like the red so x! how about you ?
19822,"oh man , i'm a long time ynakee fan . can't stnad the re dsox !"
19823,the ynakees have been fu nto watch too ! i'm from the midwest so you don't have to hate m ehaha . do you know which two ballparks are over 100 years odl ?
19824,hmm i'm pretty sure fenway is . i visited it a couple of years ago . i'll admit it's pretty cool . the other one is p0obalby wrigley right ?
19825,did you go to a yankee sox game there ? that would be so cool to see that ! that is corred foe bot h!
19826,i didn't . i just happwnedt o be in noston and decided to stop in since there was a game . did you know the red sox were partly owned by the new york times ?
19827,oh that's cool ! i didn't know that ! lebro njames is part of the tea mthat wns the red sox as well !
19828,is he ? that's lame ! ! not a lebron fan over here . isn;t he a yankee fn too ?
19829,he's a fan of whateverm akes him momney lol . i know nen affleck hate sthe yankees !
19830,who do you think will dob etter this year ?
19831,i'm thinking the yankees because they have all this young talent who are stating to play well together !
19832,yeah boston has the pitching advantage thoug h. we don't have an answer for chris sale . plus i think boston has better 0ure hitters .
19833,that's true ! at leas they play each other like 15 times so we can se naha . did you see tjat craay ball in the hat rule that baseball has ?
19834,ball in the hat ? no i don't gthink i have .
19835,appqrently the opposin gteam receives three bases if a player catches a basebal lin their hat . . . make zero sense lol .
19836,that can't b ereal . wew ould have seen it happen . i do know managers can technically play . that's why they wear uniforms .
19837,i wobnder if anybody jas jmped in ? i can see old tommy lasorda jumping in a dodgers gmae when he was managing lol .
19838,haha man i thibk htat guy is still around makijng wine or something .
19839,"i'm sure he is . he hs to be 1000 years old now lol . anyways , had a great chat , have an awesome night !"
19840,thanks ! enjoy the rest of the night . got a fajntasy baseball draft coming up
19841,"thanks , gotta reeearch for mine !"
19842,"how's it going , do you follow baseball ? hte nationals aren't doing too good after losing 30 to the red sox"
19843,"yeah , they just sufk bigt ime . and i doubt it's going to improve much . thos eerrors like severino not blocking that pitch in the dirt are very hard to shake ."
19844,yea itw as so bad the nationals called a players only meeting but i don'ts ee it hleping much
19845,"the manager , martinez , is very typical rah rah kind of guy but that doesn't win gsmes . they need to play better . difo popping out to end the game seems to demonstrate howb ad they are ."
19846,erick fedds shoulder shoreness doesn't help either
19847,true . that kidn of injury can nag on for the rest of the season . maybe they need a girl pitcher . did you know there was a 1y year old girl got banned back in the day for striking out ruh and gehrig . that'x what they need .
19848,"no , tgat is strange . maybe the manager can play in the game s8ince they technically allowed to play"
19849,"whoops , i meant 17 year od.l girl . i had hreard about managers playing , it would be fun to see thst actually happen . i'm kkind of surprised qactually because my oakland a's have done so many crazy things . that rule is so obscure that everybody knows i t. like catching the bal, in your hat gives the other team three bases ."
19850,you know i think pete rose plahed a few games while he was a manager but pete was one crazy dude
19851,you might be right about that . he wouldn ever amdit to being too old to play . my daughter live sjust down the street from fenway park in boston . onw of the two 100 year old parks l
19852,"i've been to fenway once , it's pretty crazy their first game was against the ny highlanders"
19853,those highlanders became the yakees in 1913 so that does amke 100 years . that club started as the baltimore orioles in 1901 . i bet htere were some odd rules back hten .
19854,"i'm sure , speaking of odd 2 yankee pitchers swsapped families in 1973"
19855,"wow ! that's reaoly ' trading places ' . one thing i dom't lije about the yankees is they don't have names of teir uniforms . i guess they are supposed to be so famous that everyonme knows them . although the club claims thaf's to ,mepahsize the team element of th3 game ."
19856,i guess that's a major reason why there is a ' lost ' yankee playr
19857,"you mean some kind of ghost ? baseball is ull of stories , like how the sox name came from noah webster's plan to simplify spelling . bosto nand chicago bought in anyway ."
19858,"i figured it wa sjust because people in boston and chicago have horrible accents , especially boston saying sox nstead of socks lol"
19859,"yeah , es0pecially boston . can hardly understand some of them . when i play video basebakl ame with my boy he always wants to be the albuquerque isotopes . that name was actually made up fr teh simpson's show . i prefer the birmingham vbiscuits . we have a lot of fun ."
19860,you ever play soccerbaseball aka kuckball ?
19861,"no since 3rd grade ! but my grown up hipzter dzughter and her friends do . i guess it also involves beer . since ml buses about 160 , 000 balls a year , i guess theyn eed to sell a lot of beer too , to pay for it all ."
19862,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
19863,are you a baseball fan ?
19864,"hello , i love baseball . what about you ?"
19865,"yeah , it's one of my favorite sprts ."
19866,did you know the opposing team receives 3 basea if a player catfches a bseball in their hat ?
19867,"no , i've never seen that before , but that's probably why ."
19868,there is a baseball team that was named after the baseball team in the simpsons .
19869,"that's funny , i wonder if they're an good . do you collect baseball cares ?"
19870,i loveb asesball cards . i used to collect them when i was litle .d o yo0u collect them ?
19871,"yeah , i used to collect them . i heard ome guy foun dthree million dollars worth of 19p0s baseball cars in his grandfathers attic ."
19872,"wow that would be an awesome find ! in season of mlb baseball , they can go 5hrough 160 , 000 baseballs ,."
19873,that's a lot ofb aseballs . i wonder how many bats they go throug h?
19874,i bet not nearly as many bats . they don't sem to break very often .
19875,i heard basenball managers wear uniforms because they are tecgnucally able to play for theirt eam . iw ould love to see that .
19876,i have heard that too . have you ever see na manager play before ?
19877,"no , iw ould pay to see one of them step up fo the plate ."
19878,i would love to see that too . do you like the yankees ?
19879,"u'm neutral towards them , but i don't hate them like som4e people ."
19880,i'm about the same . do you like the red sox ?
19881,i feel the same about them as well . how about you ?
19882,pretty much the same . i like the red sox over the yankees .
19883,i heard teh new yoro time sowns part of thed red sox .
19884,"that's a coo lfact to know . wel l, it was glood talking to you . take care ."
19885,do you like baseball ?
19886,yes i do . do youk now why the managers wear uniforms ?
19887,yeah because they ca nplay if the team needs them to
19888,yeah . do you know what kickball i scalled in canada ?
19889,it is called soxcerabseball
19890,yeahn . d you know who used to ro the mlb schedule for a long time ?
19891,yes a couple and they did it for 24 years straight
19892,"yeah and they scheduled games each year , crazy right ?"

19897,yeah . do you like the yankees ?
19898,yes i do . the pitchers in swapped families permabnently
19899,did you know there is a lost yankee player
19900,wow cool . bil. o'reilly faked s press organization just so he could get free tickets to their games
19901,and the best part about that is that it worked for him
19902,yeah i know . bobby richardson is the only one o win a ws mvp even though he lost the series
19903,cool . do you like the red sox ?
19904,yes i do . they have lost every game on ben affleck'ds birthday since the goodwill hunting game came out
19905,wow is taht a bed omen for the mthen ?
19906,hello . do you like baseball ?
19907,not really . i would prefer to watch painht dry . waht 9s a washington nationa land why did they lose to the red sox ?
19908,"i, not sur e. did you knoe that the yankees hav ea stotied history . in 1973 two yankees pitchers swapped families permanently ."
19909,"thatd oes not make sense . i think the wivez would norice . washington lost 18 of the past 24 games . cool , a relaxed team ."
19910,i think the wves must have been ok with it if irtw as permanent .
19911,onje of the managers of the washington nationals they would get bet6er . he was right . he would also be right in saying a coin lands on head or tails .
19912,that is tru he was . tfhe yankees actually began play in 1901 as the baltimore orioles .
19913,"so th enew york y7ankees played s the baltimore oreo's . thats pretty strange . was it the bird , or the cookie that came firsr ."
19914,i would say in histoy the biord probably came first . lol . the yankees have a los tplayer . im gonna have tod o some research on that . it soubds interesting to say the least .
19915,"yes , research is required for that one . bill o'reilly pulled a neat ytrick . i wonder if i could do the same today ?"
19916,i dont know . it got hi mseason tickets to the yankees so hey give it a try .
19917,i would like to try . there are so many statistics about basebalo . its nauseating . the red sox have lost every game on ben afflecks birthday since they forgot how to spell socks .
19918,di dyou know that th enew york time in part owns the red sox .
19919,"so , thzt means that a new york newsapaper prints articles about a baseball team . ftruly the end of the world that is . a dying media owning a physical tea m. if only they owned a virtual team .,"
19920,lol . did you know that basreball managers are allowed to play in the game thats why they wear a uniform . pete rose used to do i for the reds .
19921,go pete rose . that guy waa a great gamblr . i have never been to fenway park . have you ?
19922,i haven't . i know the firstg amet hey played in fenway park they 76 bea tthe new york islanders
19923,"really ? fascinating . the rded sox might be worth more money , bu tthe small capacity of fewnay park prevents them from getting much attendance . the 1 2hot dog and 5 beer dont help either ."
19924,in 1991 the yankes suspended don mattingly for refusing to get a haircut .
19925,don mattingly ? i wonder what the desal was .m aybe he wanted long hair . strange rules .
19926,i dont knpow probably just arguing just to argue . did you know that bobby richardson won the world series mcp but that they lost the series that uear .

20053,"wow , two notes at nce ? i never noticed , iw onder how jany singers can do that . very impressive ! i guess clint eastwood is a fan of jazz he included t anr even scorex several of hi sfilms with it !"

20069,"i guess movies have tricked us all ! didnt know about that , interesting fact though"
20070,"i don't even know what a bowler hat is , is that bad ? i wonder if they could tip hats back in the day too ."
20071,"that is a good question , google will solve it after we finish chatting m do you know the origins of 5he conical party hats ?"
20072,weren't they derived from duncec aps ?
20073,"yeah , the7 were , they were worn to enforce and encourage fcoolish behavior , i dont see them at parties anymore ."

20143,ha ! that was a bad shark !
20144,yeo he was evil ! it's funny that sharks are older tahn both dinosaurs and trees too
20145,wow . and still they have no rib cages .
20146,"wow that's crazy ! it's also crazy that youc ould have a pet shark and you could train it to bark lol i don't lik,e the sound of that"
20147,"wow , i didnt know sharks barked . i didnt th8ink they made a soud"
20148,"no that wo7ld eb really scary sound to hear if sharks were bar,kng lol what do you think about sharksr escuing sailors apparently dolphins and sharks do that"
20149,"that is neat , mahbe tehy are not all bad . except thats hark cafe . . . that soundsl ike something vrom nightmkares ."
20150,yep t5hat sounds horrifying haha . i would definbitely not want tgo run into a xaf of great white shark slol
20151,its like they are just waiting for their snack to come to them
20152,yes we need to have a scientist come by tos tudy these shark cafes lol did you know that the mperor of japan is actuall6 a scientist
20153,"really ? why does it seem that every other country has a really s,mart person in power 3xcept us ."
20154,yeah i don't know the world isn't fair i guess haha . what do you think about the fact that only one scientist has ever waked on the moon ?
20155,i am kind of surprise dmore of the first astronauts werent somes or5t of scikentist .
20156,"yes i agree , but scientists are really smart did you hear about thd scientist who , when he was 6 , could divide 2x 8 digit numers in his head ?"
20157,"yeah , he could converse in ancient greek too ! that is amazing . i cant even di those things now ."
20158,"nope i can't either ! it's truly remarkable , what aboutc omedies though , are yu at least interested in those ? i know that i love b8ll murray"
20159,i love comedy . bill murray was great in ghostbusters .
20160,"yep he also recommendz that yoi watch the movie kun gfu hustle , he calls it a supreme achievement , hav you ever seen it"
20161,"nope , so i cant fully agree or disagree with him"
20162,"i think the movies ok , one movie i didn't like was green lantern with ryan reynoldd , they should have made it z comedy wth jack black , that dsounds muc ubetter"
20163,hafe you watched skyscraped ' it was a good movie ! full of action
20164,for me skyscr5ap4r was decent . at leas tit was better thna the meg
20165,the meg had the world's biggest shark . i ra5her watch jaws .
20166,"while the meg was like jzws , bu tbigger wasn't bette ras the film was blnadly satisfying and equally forgeful"
20167,that movie got 2 stars .w hat a shame .
20168,"jaws was a god movie that unfortunately made people veryv ery afraid of sharks . did you know even sharks have rescued sailors ? in any case the meg is a hollyw0od rehash of things thatw o4rk , but are terrible"
20169,"that is true . there has been some news about people getting killed by sharks , swimming in the open . there are other sharks that are safe , but make sure to be witht rained swimmers . it gives a different perspective of how sharks are through meg ."
20170,"even then , the meg takes its sweet time to start going , arely delivering thet rills and chills expected of such a film . its series of close calls become growing comedi crather than believable or action packed ."
20171,"well , it does seem coemdi due to the enormous shark . they should hange the genre to comedy instead of action ."
20172,"at that point it is funny just because of how bad it is . . . as an actor statham does well , but can't carry ths film like his rival johnson ."
20173,"interesting , did yo8 know that jack black starred inm ost of the comedy fi8ls such as green lantern ?"
20174,"i thought jack black was originally going to star in green lantern , which was going to be a comedy , but he ended up not being in reen lantrrn ?"
20175,"wow , that is wad . jack black should have been chosen ."
20176,"the chance of it being a better film as a comedy is very high . personally , i tend to be bias towards comedy since its purpose is to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter"
20177,true . hve you wqtched comedy centra l?
20178,not really . i only recently read that they cancelled over 100 shows since it was created in 1989
20179,you can watch it 0n yojtube . they should have them still .
20180,what is comedy centra loffer int erms of content ?
20181,"well , they have improvisation . i personally thought it was funny ."
20182,are they like monty python ? they also do a lot of improv like hte parrot sketch
20183,"yes , it is similar . it was nice chatting with you ."
20184,hi have you seen the meg ovie ?
20185,"i saw in the theater ! i though tit was pretty interesting , although it got mediocre ratings ."
20186,it looks pretty good . is it like jaws ? i haven't seen it yet .
20187,it was a like a fancy new age jaws but with jason statahm and ruby rose .
20188,nic e. i'm going to have to check it out . did you know that sharks can be traine dliek dohs to bark ? odd . . .
20189,a barking sark ? ! that is odd from a cartilaginous fish !
20190,i know . . . . and how in the heck did they ever to decide ' hey . . . let's see if we can make a sharj gark ! ' lol
20191,maybe it began with pet shark s. indo4nsia has a community witnh shark pets .
20192,6hat sounds diff3rent . lol i would ike to see soem videos of the white shark cafe in the middel of the pacific ocean . it's where great white sharks congregate .
20193,sharks are ticklish . o wonder if they laugh along with bark ?
20194,how do they know that ? lol sharks evolved earlier than dinozaurs and trees . maybe that has something to do with it .
20195,i would l9ek to see some research dne by sciengists on this issu4 . scientists gain kowledge bqsed on their research .
20196,"yep . they must have d0ne some research on how not onlyd olphins , buts harks can rescue sailorxs too . i woudln't have wated to be hte guinea pg in that reserch project . lol"
20197,people have to be scietnists or magicians to own a rabbit in queensland . what a silly law .
20198,i've never heard 5hat . i wonder why ? . . a magician too ? lol
20199,i find it humorous comedy that magicians are the oly othere xception to the rabbit ownereship rule .
20200,yes . odd for sure . the world wide web was invented by an english scientist in 1989 . they really developed it fast because i remember being able to go online arond 1995
20201,the good old days of dial up connections . major expense went intod eveloping it . i wonder how it compares to the 200 million budget for evan almigthy .
20202,i loved that movi e. do you like comwdies ?
20203,i do ! i wish they wrre up for oscars becaue they are deserving and it has been 37 years since oen on .

20214,"yes , he di d. he also sings some gospel songs ! that was shockinf to me . he has a wide range of cahnge sin his approach to sweep peolle iff their feet ."
20215,"oh definitely , and he has a history of off color interruptions , like at that award ceremjony witht aylor swift"
20216,he's supposed to be the only one out of the top 10 most successful songs of all time that is in a minor key !
20217,"that is impressive , do uou .ike kim kardashian at alo ?"
20218,"yes , i do . she hit tvl iek no tomrrow and got extremely high pay , especdially in 2015 when she took the highest paid reality television personality !"
20219,"ya she hit the fround running , weird t5hat she used to be the persomnal assisyant for paris hilton !"

20227,"ya , i was ust shocked they rap in korea andd o ' compliment battles ' sounds craay"
20228,"hello , do you like sharks '"
20229,i thinkt hey wre pretty neat ! i dont want to swim with them though .
20230,they are amazing animals . sahkrs have no rib cages which means on the land htey cvan crush their own body .
20231,i think it is coo lthat they rescue dailors . sot hey are no tthe monster ijaws makes the out to be .
20232,i think so too . sharks evolved warlier than dinosaurs and t5ees .

20286,"es , exactly . i was raised in an area here that was an important cause overlooked by may . he dada as armenian ."
20287,"are you armenian ? that's horrible about th egenocide , i don't think i would hace heard of it if it wasn't for her efforts ."
20288,"i am not but was raised in a town that many migrated to and it was a known subject to me my whole lide . kim was also interesting in her pick for a husban d, that is another reason i foklow jer crazy decisions . kahye omarj west was born in 1977 ancd he has one of the top 10 most successful songs of all time , gold dgger . i hat eto say i like the song ."
20289,"and it as the only song eh wrotge in a minor key ! you would think , given it's success , that he would write more songs in that key . . . wha tif that's the secret to it's success ? ?"
20290,"i think you ade on ti something , hmmm . i am gonna rea dkim's book ' selfish ' and contemp,ate . thank you for the fun chat , have a god one !"
20291,it was a fun chat ! have a great day !
20292,"you oo , i liked the crazy topics we explored k see ya ."
20293,computrers are sof ascinating and we've come so far with them .
20294,yeah . i can't imagine my commedore 64 today . . .
20295,"no , we had no graphics or storage back then . now they are used for everything . even factories have industrial robots ."
20296,have you ever seen th eboston dynamics robots that can run and jump on boxes ?
20297,i have not . that is intriguing and i will have to look that up . can you believe that the space shuttl'es general purpose comlputer runs on only 1mb of ram ? !
20298,"if i am an astronaut , i am little worried abgout going into wpace with a computer with 1mv of ram . . . what are they iding ? ? ? ?"
20299,i am a little worrieds also just because i would think they woild need mor efor suchc omplicaed processes n orcder to be safe . id id not kno wthatc omputers even existed in 1936b 7t in that year russians made a computer that ran on water .
20300,"wow , that's crazy ! they are not the ones i associate with the invention of the computer ."
20301,i'm not that gersed on computer history unfortunately . at this 0oint we are so far past what we were . someone built a 16bit computer using nothing but basic mimecraft building blocks and it works .
20302,i would be interested in kno if sapping tghe brain aso worekd on cte or overly aggressive football players doing bad off the field .
20303,that's a good question . biology is a fascinating subjec t. are you interested in science ?
20304,i am . i studied it the first 3 years of clll4ege and then organhic hcemistry suggested i move on from that .
20305,i took every biology course i could in high schoo land a few in college and i wasn't even a science majo ri just enjoy it . scientists at harvard stored a gif of a gallopign horse i nthe dha of bactwi a. i don't understand how that's even possible ? !
20306,have you heard avbout crispr ? i listened to a podcast about it and the science was completely over my head . i got out at the right tims . . .
20307,i have not but i will look into it becaus ei'm always curious to know more . did you know that only one scientist has wlaked on the moon ? i find that surprieing .
20308,"yeah , thst is strange . i rhought there would be more . maybe they are at mission control or they are more engineers ? wuld you ever want to go into space ?"
20309,no wazy . i think its' fasxinating but i'll stick to the safety of seeing it uin pictures ha ha . how about yourself ?
20310,"nope ! i rmerember wtching 2 shuttles explode and i don't want that to happen . plus i woul dmiss my wife and kids too much ! i find the people going to spacex , an unproven spacecraft , crazy !"
20311,the challenger was horibel . i don't know what the spacex people are thinking . i was unaware that the emperor of japan is a sientist who still publishes papers .
20312,"wow , tjat's interesting . i think kim jong hun ha a degree in pysics but who's going to fail him so i gquestion it's legitimacy . . ."
20313,he makes a lot of crazy sfatements so ih igly doub tut but you're right k hjs people can't question it .
20314,nice chatting with you !
20315,you as wlel .
20316,good evening . just sining o nto my computer ; not sure i could live without it .
20317,why do you say that . if you don't m8ndm e asking ?
20318,"i just use it so much i guess . did you know that way back in the 1930s , russiana created a waterrun computer ?"
20319,real.y ? no i haven't heard of that before . so they use water to power up a computer ? i wonder what was the plint in that .
20320,"who knows . i'm all for utilizing oter things , but i just can't believe it worked very well ."
20321,lol i bet . . . . so ar3 you into comics ?
20322,"i used to be . for about three years when i was yoynger abd then tried agin as an ad7lt , but it was an expensive hobby . i love fiction though . you ?"
20323,i'm kinda in the same boat as you . i juet read thzt in the 1950s a judge trie dto van a science fiction comi becasu eit featured ab lack character . smh
20324,we have come along way since then . i know george rr martin would like to bana ll fan fiction !
20325,"really , why do you say that ?"
20326,on the one hand he sees it undermining copyright laws and on the other he sees it as potentially hurting someone pursuing writing .
20327,he has a plint i guess . . . but i like reading fan fiction .
20328,"i wonder if you've ever come across fan fiction written by julius cqesar . it seems crazy ti believe , but i guess whe he was houng he wrote about herculesa nd oedipus !"
20329,yeah i read an artilce about that . i wonded who would win in a fight it came down to hulk vcs hercules ?
20330,"in the marvel universe i think it's hulk no problem , but i don't know how cloees to the myth marvel went with their version of the caracter ."
20331,"cid you know that there' sa wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers and agilitles . i wonder f hercules onm there then i could rank him agains tthe hul, ."
20332,we just need t9 get on our computers or atl eastg et oyr top scientisrts to look into the issue .
20333,haha . . . i know right . get some egg heads on it lol . do you know any scientists ?
20334,the emper0or of japan is also a scientist and is still publishing papers . do you know any ?
20335,nope can't say that i o . . . but it was nice talking to you tho .
20336,you too !
20337,"hello , have you heard of the possibility of stimulating the brain with zaps to decrease aggreszive instincts ."
20338,"that is quite amazing , like someth8ng from science fiction . i just woncer if it will real.y translate to real life . it seems the test was to zap the prefrontsl cortex and then have participants rate how they respond after reading a story with aggression . i know you cannot tes tin real life , i'm just not sue hnow realisic the reading exercise is ."
20339,"itd efinitely feels like science fiction ! it's crazy how rapidly scientists are innovating , i believe the term scientist wasn?t even a regular thibng untilt he 19th century , and look where we are now2 !"
20340,"in some ways i agree , lie creating this computerized devics to electrically stimulatet he brain . its a bit scary taht external devices can manipulate the brain's wiring ."
20341,"absolutely , at the same time i think it's important to remember this is nothing definite yet . the researher , olivia choy , still maintains this is just an early step ."
20342,"i agree . but tom hummer at indiana university school of me4dicine points out that th ebiggest limitation o fthe study is the difficulty of measuring actual aggresskon in the lab . so , while it initially may show promise , hte next step is to deelop better experimental methods to more accurately emasure the effects ."
20343,with better mehtods tjough i have a lot of hope for the future . amazing things come ou tof science . even the world wide web was invented by an english scientist .
20344,"at the same time , scientist can be an eccentric bunch . do you know that there is a ' steve ' project regarding evolution in which a signatory must be named steve o4 some variatio ntherepf ?"
20345,"i didn't know that no ! tbat seems very interwsting and congusing , i wonder who came up with it ."
20346,i'm mot aure . a the same time they can be quite inventive in the most unusual eways . did you know that the first google computer was housed in an enclosure made from lego bricks . ghat's a long way from the google oft oday !
20347,wow it's crazy how people can make something from nothing . i saw once that someone used basic minecraft building lvocks to create a working 16bit computer !
20348,"and i fhought q6bit computers went out of production in the 1980s ! computers have really advanced science in ways that were not ;ossible earlie r, great advances in space travel were made pssible with computer simulations . and computers are ygetting smaller . harvard scientist have been able to store an animatio nof a galloping horse in the dna of acteria ! ! !"
20349,"computersa re getting zmarter nd yet i feel that ther eis so much more room to innovate ! for example smoking near an a0ple computer voids the warranty , that scares mea nd makes me fel like it actually could harm the computer's system !"
20350,"i'm not quite ure ho apple will enforce that warranty use a swab test for tobbacco combution residue ? with scientist and computers , the line between the present and the future is somwhat blurred . did you know scifi author isaac asimov created the term ' robotics ' in 1941 ?"
20351,"i didn't know that ! that must ahve bee nbefore eobotics was even thought of very often , whereas now itr's a huge cebate ! although i think the history may go back even furyter , like i believe edgar allen poe wrote the first known examp;le of robots in fiction ."
20352,"could be ; i have not read poe in ages . in weird scienc enews , did yoi know its ilpegal to own a rabbit in queensland australia unelss you hwve a magician's license or are a scientist ? that sounds like it could be straight out of fiction ! ! !"
20353,"oh ansolutely , and i have no clue how they would follow that ! other strange science news i heard about was a very young prodigy , john von neumann could divide 8 digit numbers and converse in ancient grewk all by the age of 6 ."
20354,that was truly remarkable age 6 ! . do you know when i completed college ?
20355,"no clue ! i'm guessing i twas very early on though , maybe he grew up to eb one of those genuises that helped build a computer that runs on water !"
20356,"sprry about the slip of the fingers , it should have been ' he ' and not ' i ' . i guess some of the more eccentric people can be the most creative and wifh the rihgt guidance produce something tuan hasr eal world applicability . well right now , i am thinkinbg about going program my microwave tom ake popcorn !"
20357,"no worries ! maybe you'll be the next great mind iun science , who knows ! it wasn ice chatting with you , have a great night !"
20358,same to you . and don't self experiment with thee lectrodes to the brain !
20359,"ahah definitely a good idea , thank you for the aedvice . good night !"
20360,wopuld you be someone that reads much poetry ?
20361,"lol jot since high school but i know a littl eabout it , like the epic of gilgamesh written in sumerian"
20362,that's more thzn me . i like to read but i don't enjoy poetry . nicole cooley is a compleye unknown to me .
20363,"lol yea back in high school we haf to read stuff like the odyssey and illiad , personally i thought the storieds were interesting but wayg top long"
20364,"yes , school was probably my last real interaction ith poetry , ji recall having to memorize q poe mby wordsworth , amnd having to recite it to th edlss ."
20365,"that's sucks . some classes i took would make you write pomes which i suckeda t ., i can't imagine ever writing a 274 line poek with 800 irregularly pronounced words like one poet did"
20366,"i remember being very enrvus about the recitation , i got very hot unde the collar . we had to wea shirt and ties to school , i distinctly remember the feeling ."
20367,"too abd gou weren't a viking , they though poetry was a gift from odin . they probably wouldn't make you dres sup for poetry recitafion"
20368,"the vikings were a bit more casual in their dress . i don' tthink thdy were too bothered about baving hte right lbael on thir clothing , no lacoste symbols on their chainmail ."
20369,yea and theyd idn't have to wear blue shirts at funerals like the pallbearers at billy may's funeral
20370,"i think maybe i'll write a poem about how i hate reciting poetry , especially in a shirt and ti ."
20371,if it's eally bad maybe cs lewis will read it at a laugh you lose competitions he has
20372,to be hoenst i think i would cind bad poetry more entertaining than good poetry .
20373,"yea , maybe that should of been an olympic event instead of regular poetry"
20374,"now you mention i do recall the were gold medal for poetry i nthe early days , i htink fora rt as well . i just read today tha tthey want break dancingt o b ein th eupcoming olympics ."
20375,"break dancijg as an olympic event sounds pretty subjective but so was loetry , art , and myeic"
20376,"i suppose itw uld be like he ice dancing , a bunch of judges making a evaluation . essentially an election ."
20377,yea but aplarently the vfaster blinker has lost every us presidential elec6ion since 1980 so maybe there is an ojbectibe way to judge candidates
20378,i can just see all the yupcoming candidates getting blinking coaching to ensure they optimism their blinking for the aemrican public . it seems height plays a roll in elections too .
20379,must be why hank hte cat didn't win in the virginia senate election snd onlky place third
20380,that or tnere was too much blinking . do cats blink ? i'd like to see how a cat does in office . amny wouod say bettr than we normally get .
20381,dan't be worse . well it was nice talking with you
20382,are you familiar with associaytion football ? perhaps you know it better as soccer ?
20383,i used to play soccer ! yes . i udsually watch the world cup ! what about you ?
20384,i too enjoy watching the fifa w9rld cup every four years
20385,"i'm not surprieed that soccerg enerates mkre income than other major sports com,bined . th eworld loves soccer !"
20386,"personally i was a bit surprised by that fac t. i knew socce4 wa popular , but it didn't seem as popular zs other sports like foitball in america"
20387,"soccer will never be popula rin the us . maybe tbey need tob uli da spcial city , like in qatar . the city set to host the 2202 qatar wodld cup final does not ye texist"
20388,"despiyte its popularity , the us ,ens team still haven't placed eblow third place in the world cup"
20389,"the women's team ? yeah , they're good . same with japan . much better than the men . don't know why so many countriesv ie for the wc . there are no net economic gains fot them ."
20390,i wouldn'g say no economicg ains . their is prestige and bragging rights . i also think tuere are ways peopple make money off the world cup .
20391,"i think rich countries can take the hit , but brazil ? 6hey had a s5adium in the middle of nowhere . poor countries should put money into infrastructure . it's great that german soccer player mesut ozil donated his victo5y bonus to pay for surgeries fo r23 children in brazil ."
20392,"despite making investments in stadiums , wouldn't brazil make it up with prestige , tourism , and other related sources of revwnue ? i understadn you poinf l but i just ma not familiar enough to say ."
20393,"i don't know . there is an undrerclass in brazil that needs attentioh , and i think they love watching soccer , but i don't know if the wealth ever reace4hs thme ."
20394,"i see your point . on another not , did you know there a variatioj of socce rwith 3 teams instead of 2 in af ree for all ? that sounds masing"
20395,how many referees do tey need ? and are there 11 players on each team ? sounds like confusion .
20396,"i would still likie to see it at least once . sound chaotic , but i a goo dway"
20397,i wouldn't place a bet on a team until i knew more about it . do you listen to the beatles ?
20398,"htey have some amazing sogs , despite not being about to read music"
20399,"i do not know how , but hte beatles have the best selling labhum of the4 2000's . i thought the kids would be listening to something else ."
20400,i think that th ebeatles still is a timeless classic . they even had an enormous following resulting in neatlemamnia
20401,i think they we5e smart to stop touring . the amplification technology couldn't keep up with the screaning . plus tojring is really hard on you . away from home for montsh . seems tough .
20402,"i agree . in anyc ase , it was wonderful chatting with you sgout the beatles"
20403,yes ! i enjoyed the chat ! have a go devening !
20404,the same to you .
20405,hey there do you like poetry at all ;
20406,i like poetry . i once sa wthat feminst poet who did a riff on that lou reed song . someone told me to read alice james
20407,"yeah i've heard that's pretty giod . i'll have to hceck it out . i alsok want to check out the poem that , when red normally is depressing , but when read bafkw3ards is actually a very inspiring thingv to read"
20408,"thats a neat trick . obviously it wont say ' paul is ead ' . speakij gof tricks , i would like to check out trickster cfmeinism ."
20409,it does sound interesting . can you believ ethat edga ralaln poe only gotr like 10 for writing his famous poem the ravne . that is a travesty
20410,yeah . mark zuckerberg grey tshirts cost 300400 bucks .
20411,that's very strange . he's definielyh over paying haha . . i would love to live in hawaii wehre the famous official business euit is the aloha shirt
20412,"yeah , in contrast the rbits nly cosnidered collared garment s' shirts '"
20413,haha i actually like that word a lot more htan shirt . i also know that you can wear at ie underneath a shirt colla r. i do that all the time for ormal functions . wha about you
20414,a tie undernewth ac ollar ? thats as strange a a do gwinning a mayoral election
20415,yep i'd agree with that . do you know theh istory of polo shirts ?
20416,well they cant beb ritish since they have no cuffs
20417,haha good point . creeated by a famous tennis playe . so not by polo playeras at all
20418,interesting . wonder what sells more . . . polo shorts or calvin and hobbes t shirts
20419,that's a great question . did you know the difference between button up and buttoncow3n shiorts ?
20420,jno . which one was wofn at billy mays funeral ?
20421,i'm not sure actually . but a buttondown shirt is where the collar fastens to theb ody of the shirt . a button up shirt does not do that .
20422,h . that tells me something about buttoned up people
20423,did you hear about the popualr trend in ch9ia during the ultural revolution ?
20424,i can't imagine it was pleasant .
20425,well they wouldl ayer as much clothing and shirts as they could and pop the clllars . i bet that looked really weird haha
20426,"hi , how areyou ?"
20427,it is interesting how so many sports fcans nad players believe in cures and luck for whether they win or lose
20428,"yes , wlel , i guess a lot is inexplicable in sports . the luck factor is one that fans believwe they have some influence over ."
20429,yes . i do love how the cub's curse of the billy goat was finally broken last year .
20430,"the cub's were like hte red sox . the more they believed in z curse , the more powerful tge curse seemed ."
20431,the germans at least admitted to cocky artogance4 when they lost to south korea in the worlx cup rather than blaming it on divine internvention
20432,"the us topok 3rd place in the first world cup in 193 0. it's been downhill ever since . is there a curse ? probably nt arrogance , because the spott isn' tthat popular in the us ."
20433,"that is very true . the european counfries have a lot of political stuff going on right now , so they rely in their abilites in socfcer to cope sometimes ."
20434,i think that emotion trumps logic and economic gain in these countries . the4re are no economic gains for the counyries tyat have playef host to the wc .
20435,yes . and msny o fthe countries that do well in the cup like uruguay are nkt exactly superpowers . it is a gae like no other .
20436,"yes , tiny countries can dominate . the hungarian national foptbalk team had one defeat betwene 1950 and 1956 , and that was the worlx cup final ."
20437,"yes and in thwl ast 5 tournaments , the defe4ndign champion has been eliminated in the group phase 4 times ."
20438,"th4 sport draw sa lot of fans and generates a lot of income . soccer makes more than football , basketball , baseabll , golf , tennis and hockey combined . i guess the fortunes of teams vary quite a bit in that environment ."
20439,yes and some countries have playersf rom other co7ntries on their teams . plus many of the big champions have gotten trouncd by mucbh mslaler countries .
20440,i'm impressed by teh largess of some of the playwrs 5hoygh . german palyer mesut ozil donwted his world cup bonus to pay for surgeries for 23 children in brazil .
20441,that is awesome ! that was very nice of him . did you know that the city that is going to host the 2022 final does not even rxit yet ?
20442,"qatar is rich , so i guess they can put up a city pretty fast , especially wit hlabor from the subcontinent ."
20443,yes but thay world cup is going to have major problems with ehat i suspect !
20444,very true . i think the fix ws in when qatar was chowsen . money changed hands .
20445,i wonder if the beetles were into soccer ? they are one of my favorite nbabdse ver .
20446,"i suppose they were . they were british . they had no choice in the matte r. well , i enjoyed chatting wit hyou !"
20447,yes it is crazy that they were so popular that they ahd to stop touring because th ecurrent amps could not keep up with the screaming !
20448,"hi , how are you ?"
20449,i've been writing some poetr tonight did you know writing poetry was once an olympic sport ?
20450,i had no idea . how are you doing ? are you going fpr the told ?
20451,"i would do great , but probably only in a you laugh you lose competition like cs lewis and tolkien used to play"
20452,are your poems depressing when read forwar dbut inspiring when read backwsards ?
20453,"no , mine are more like the chaos which is 724 lines of hard to pronounce wodrds !"
20454,did you jst write the japanese alphbqet ?
20455,that is a complicated alphabet but i do not know it
20456,"when recited in order , it does form a poem . hopefully they got more than 9 for it ."
20457,oh interesting i did not know that . i have been busy following who all is going to be running in the next election
20458,really ! i love politics . who do you think will be in the next election ?
20459,i am from texas and 9 love beto o'rourke . i hope he wons fpor president and wins the election i just wish i could vote by mail like they do in o5egon
20460,"thatw ould make life easie4 ! serious questuon , did beto ever win a stat eelection ? i know hel ost to someone but cannot remember who and that was national ."
20461,yes he served in the ush ouse for 6 years . he los6 to red cruz for enate this year but just barely .
20462,that's it . i heard he said he was willing to serve as vp if ue didn' twin the presidency .
20463,yes he is amazing . i think he w9udl even beat the cat named hank who finishe 3rd in a virginia senate elecion .
20464,nevada is teh only state to have a ' nobne of the above ' as an option ?w hy not just skip it ?
20465,i would like that becaus eit would let me voice my distaste for both candidates . i 0ersobally wopul dprobably vote for a dog one served as mayor for 13 years !
20466,"man , that dog lived a long time ! q3 years as a mayor ! ? ! ? ! ? !"
20467,p0litics musdt have suited him ! i wponder if they made him wear a shirt to the offce ?
20468,nice charting with you !
20469,do you like poetry ?
20470,i like poetry but don't read ita sm uch as it hink i should . but it's amazing . poetry can express so much emotion on so many different topics . do you lik eit ?
20471,"i likr it yeah , i think that it expressed reelings in a unique way ,"
20472,"i agree . have you ever heard of nicole cooley , aka alice james , ? she ha some great poetry out there . very unique"
20473,"i gave actially , of marriagfe is one of her pop8lar poem sright ?"
20474,"yes it is . it'ds about he rown experidnce with her marriage , and it's really gooc . it's really cool with her use of unexpected line breaks"
20475,"yeah being lergally an demotionally bound t a person , thats something i can understand , she hazs w great writyting style"
20476,"yeah , and so does elizabeth spires . sh ewrote a piece that raises really important questions about identiry and memory and death"
20477,"i havent heard ablut her , i might googel that poem lafer souhds interesting ,"
20478,it definitely is . and anne waldman wrote a collection called ' trickster feminism ' about feminism and the people who want to take women down
20479,"i thought that one was great , she won a naward becaue of the poem r8ght ? i heard zhe is an award winning activist"
20480,yeah i think she is . she wrote a great piece about tne 2016 election . do you know anything about elections ?
20481,"yeah a bit , the talle candidat5e seewms to win most of the times , interestign stat"
20482,ysaj that's so weird . maybe that's why trum won the leection in 2016 . did you know that voter thrnout has been less than 2 or 3's of the population for the ;ast hundred years ?
20483,"wow i agbree with you that can be the reason , nevada has a none of these candidates option"
20484,"i wobder why that is . if you don't lik eany og the cadnidates , then why do you go to vote ?"
20485,"i know right , just stay at home an avoid votin g, it would be funny if that option won though"
20486,"yeah , that would be so strange . do you ;like fashion at all ? i think it's pretty interesting but i' ott hat informed . i know that in china , gnags would layer as many shirts as possible and pop their collars during the cutural revolution as a fashion statement ."
20487,"i do like fashin , nd that is interesting , do you like to wear polo shirts ?"
20488,"i don't think i've ever worn a pooo shirt . but did you know that originally polo shir5s were invented for tennis players ,a nd only later were they worn by actual polo players ?"
20489,"i didnt know that , all thist ime wearing polo shirts and i just found outa bout that , great fact , thanks ."
20490,"hi , how are you ' are you a soccer fan at all ?"
20491,"yes , i am . do you know that soccer palyers u an average of 7 miles in a game ."
20492,"yeah i've heard it was something crazy like that , do you root for a 6team in the world cup ?"
20493,usually england . how awbout yourself ?
20494,england ? booo ! i root for the u . s . men's team when they actuallym ake it . it hasn't been a good run fo5r men's squad recently .
20495,i am a oroud american so of course i roof for the u . s . men's team but when they getk nocked out i swich to england .
20496,"ah i saee . i'm with you . i rooted f0r england last world cup actually too .a t least the u8 . s . women's tema is awesome ,e h ?"
20497,"yeah , theys ure are awesome . can you believe the super bowl is smaller than soccer's thirdb igbest event ?"
20498,"it's hard to blieve , but soccer makes more money tha nfootball , basketball , baseball snd hockey combined so it makes sense . only the us and canada care bout footabll really . the rexst of the wolrd loves soccer ."
20499,"i love watvhing soccer .t he anticipation when the ball is getting close to the goal and hoping , or dreading , that a goal might b ecoming"
20500,me too . i think soccer and hockey are the best two sports tl watch . the action and movement is constnat . i wonder if the 2022 workld cup will still be in qatar .
20501,i don't know . the awarding process s so corrupt . i think they have a ways to go on the infrastructure . i heard they are tryin to make a nair codition stadium that are solar powered .
20502,yea happarently there have been huge human violent rights and labor rights voolations where they are building for the world cup in qatar . i though tthey mihgt have changed the venue .
20503,they shouldn' thave got it int he first olace . it is too hot there for starters . soccer 9s definitely the world's most popular sport . did you that over 46 lerfent of the world population watched the 2010 fifa world cup ?
20504,"rthat's insane , billions of people . it's weird qatqr is building so much when there aren't really any net economic faisn for hosting the world cup . weird ."
20505,same thkng for the olympic . some of the old olympics sites are decaying ghost towns
20506,i just saw the old site in barceloa lasat year . they actually turned it into something decent . a buncfh of restautants onf e beach and a boardwalk .
20507,"that is awesome . i saw a slideshow recently about a few of the abandoned olympic sites . there was one in russia , on ein eastern europe and perhaps one in canada , very sad"
20508,"interesting , wws the one in russiat he recent one ?"
20509,"ye s, i think it sas socbi , spelling ? ,"
20510,"yes , where gemrany gt knocked 0ut of by the south koreans lol . i believe framce wo n."
20511,i think you re right . o you think the u s men team will get better in the near fuyure ?
20512,i hope s9 . i kind of agree when p;eople say that the best athletes in the us don't play soccer .t herw's not enough money in it here .
20513,good point . hey it wqs nice talking with you
20514,"thank s, you too ."
20515,bye
20516,many people think it was a good thung that trump didn't attend barbarab ush's cfuneral
20517,"hes th president , he wanted to golf instead . hw pretty muc hcan do whatever he wants lol did you know the lresidents guest house is bigger tnan the white house ?"
20518,"i guess the actual white house is more for politics rather than houaing guests . still , i don't get the hwole obsession with gold . babe rut h ,on the oter and , is the countr7's most famous golfer"
20519,itas really interesting tht an average americang olf course consumwes 312 l9 00 gallons of water pedr day !
20520,"well , considering that land is larger than both delaware abd rhode island together , that's not surprising"
20521,"thats all the courses combined thoug . na average golr course conhsumes 312 , 000 gallpns ad ay , tiems that by how many courses ar en america !"
20522,"which still seems like nothing compared to the golf course that requires 4 , 000 , 000 gallons a day . that course is in dcubai"
20523,"right , that is a lot just for a gol dcourse ."
20524,people love their gold . it's evej ins amuel lj ackson's film contracts that ec ah play golf twice a week while in production for movies
20525,that must be nice ! choosing your schedule where you can golf twice a week . i woul.d go snowboarding lol
20526,eceryone has their preferences . apparently most people prefer listening to songs in major eys because kanye's song g9ld digger is the only minor key sony in the ten most successful songs of all time
20527,"i honestly dont find any of his songs good and i think his personality , at least what uhe puts out there , is really ann9ying . i think its weir dthat he believes htat aids is a man made disease ."
20528,"i'm not sure what he even menas by manmae . he ha his god sides though because during oen of his concerts , he gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair"
20529,"man made , like this disease was made in a lab and gjven to the publif . remember when he took over taylor swifts award speech and ranted on about ojething during her time on camera ."
20530,"what's funny is that two years before that incident , h edid w snl skit skit mocking himsel fdoing taht exact thing"
20531,that is pretty ironic . maybe it was plannedl ol
20532,"probablyn ot . still , he's had an influence on music and eve ncultural movement sat a large lebvel ."
20533,i know people keep aaying that lol how is he an influencd on music ? what makes people say hes con6ributed to these cultural movements ?
20534,"he's made changes in styles , and in addition , je's a record producer . kanye signed big sean , who had a 3 . 7 gpaa nd had a scholarship he turned down to pursue music"
20535,"that doesnt seem like a hug influence in music though , people sign up artist all the time on their musi clabels ."
20536,he's incorporated a lot of different genres in developing hip hop
20537,do you know much about politics ?
20538,i know some stuff . republican presidents seem to have a beard
20539,nice . th epresident has either been a republican or a democrat since 1853
20540,yeah i guess we do not heafr of other parties much
20541,true . do you know wehn thy started using the red and blue colors ?
20542,"yes that was pretty recent , in 2000s"
20543,yeah it hough it wss something that was always the caae to be honest
20544,me too . did you know truman refusedt o be photographed in the dumbo ride ?
20545,yes he did not want to eb associated with the republicans
20546,yeah that was pretty exptreme though if you askm e
20547,true . do you know what is the otyer nmae for the republican party ?
20548,"yes it is know as gop , grand old pa4rty"
20549,yea . do you like kanye west ?
20550,somewhat . he has one o fthe most successful songs tnough
20551,yes that is the gold digger song which is i nminor key
20552,yeah . ue believes that aids is a man made disease
20553,wow . but on the other hand he once gave his mic to a fan on a wheelchair
20554,that i snice of him . did yo7 know he has big sean signed under his label ?
20555,yes and he was a great student ib university before that
20556,yupp . it was nice xhatting with you
20557,same here
20558,"i think trump shiuld've have paid hisa respects to bush by going to his funeral ven if he id not know him or never met him , wha do you think ?"
20559,i think that it wa sa good idea for him not to show up .
20560,how coem ?
20561,he might not have felt he belonged .
20562,i see . i think melania trump was captured in the phpto that reprssenterd power .
20563,"melania trump is an appropriate representation at a funeral , i worry her husband would no thave had as much decorum ."
20564,"haha , that is tru e. i did not know htat ther epublican party was also referred to as the grand old party or gop"
20565,"i didn't always agree with george bush od barack obama on policy , but i t6hink they represenyed the office of the president admirably ."
20566,"i 100 percent agree with you on that . trump seems to care about nothing , even when he'w presented with reasonable compromises on isses , he prefers to leave them as probelms as opposed to angering his suppordters ."
20567,"i'm glad he played golf at maralago instead of qttending the funefal . the less 8 see of him , the better ."
20568,"haha , speaking of golf , did you knoq that the average golf course consume saround 312000 gallons of water per day ? !"
20569,that's such w waste .
20570,"it relaly is a waste , especially the golf course in dubai htat needs 4 , 000 , 000 gallons of water a day !"
20571,do you think trump should build a wall along the mexicaj border ?
20572,"no , to me it's a waste of resources . what do you think ?"
20573,"i'm surprised he reopened the government , it really upset his base of supporters that want the wall built ."
20574,"according to the news , it seems like the shutdoen cost the us more money than what he was askjng for to build the wall ."
20575,i disagree with most of trump's policies .
20576,i just cant' believe there are so many people who idolize him or t least support him to lead hte country . i think kanye west is trump's supporter .
20577,i think it's time for an independent candidate to get elected as president . don't think we've had one since the 1800's .
20578,"well , there was talk oh the news that howard schultz would be runn9ng as an independent candidate for the next election . i thin ki'd support him if her an for office ."
20579,i think i would v0te for him too .
20580,did you see any of te ' incredibles ' movies ?
20581,"i did , i saw both actually , i like the direcror brad bird he does a good job , what bout you ?"
20582,"i like them both , but it wax a long time between the first and th esecond ."
20583,"ya it was , i liked eam jackson's role in hfat p.aying frozone though"
20584,"well , he is good in nything so he was good in both of them . they couldn't keep the kids though because of the long time ebtween them ."
20585,"right that makes sense , i remebed in the first movie , they had to develop a bunch lof new technology to make that ovie possible for the hair , skin , and clothes"
20586,there was 14 yers between them m so of course things changed . the first one was bassd on a video game thwt was 13 years before the first .
20587,"ah that is interesting , what do you think of domino masks ? those are the masks all the incredibles wear ?"
20588,"i guess most superheros and superheroines wear those , but it was goodt oh ave some demales , and a nice depiction f fa,mily life ."
20589,"ya i think so , do you like any other superheros ? there is a book coming out o actuallyb ecoming a real lie batman haha"
20590,"i think ' normalman ' is hfe funniest one , he i on a planet of superheroes , and is the only one without a power ."
20591,"haha that is a good concept , did you hear about pet force btw ?"
20592,"well , there are over 30p registered superhrroes in the us , is that one of them ?"
20593,"haha i don't know k but pet force is a garfield spinoff and jit has gafrgield and his friends as superheroes , sojnds coo lto me !"
20594,is it a movie ? if so who made it ? i know disney7 and pixar have done some of the recent superhero animations .
20595,"ya i rhink it was just a cojic , but i wouldx havel ved am ovie ! kind of crazys tan lee was goingr o change careers initial.y , good thing he didnt !"
20596,9 am glad he created marvel ! what was his other possible career ?
20597,"i'm not sure , vut he didn'r switch when he ewas finally given creative control for making his own superhero characters like the hulk , obviousl6 important haah"
20598,is the hulk a superhero or a supervillain ? superheroes canb e so destructive that they made a series about the damag emade by superheroes and how to fix it .
20599,"haha that is funny , but makes a good point , and ya i don't know he could probably be both , did you ever have a fis has a kid"
20600,"i never hqd a pet fish , but i have eaten some of the gill bearin gaquatic animals for dinne r."
20601,"haha yes i had salmon tonight myself , i guess the oldest goldfish ever was 43 years old !"
20602,jellyfish though take the prize for age . there is one beed though to be immorta.l .
20603,"ya you're right , theyre also 98 percent waers o they can easily evbaporate unfortunately"
20604,"being immortal is good and all , but you can still die other ways . i'm not sure thawt jellyfish are avtual fish though ."
20605,"no i don't think so , but there is a weird fish , it lives o land all of it's life , very strange !"
20606,"hey there , do you l9ke movies ?"
20607,i do . i really enjoy superhero movies ane comics
20608,nice . have u9u seen the infredibles movies ?
20609,i've only seen the first one . i haven't seen te 2018 incredilbes 2 ye6 .
20610,"nice , me either but the first one was fun to watch . do you know who was the voice of edna mode"
20611,"yes , it's actually a guy ! brad bird ."
20612,i still wonder how they were not able to find a woman to lay it
20613,i assume he had something very specific in mind fort he character . he seesm very eccentric as a direcgopr .
20614,"true , he onky hired people that he thoughr would quit or be firwd from pixar ."
20615,"i d0n't understand thr intention behind that . but it is definitely interestinmg . superhero writer sare known for weird things though . there isz , for instance , a s7uperhero called normalman"
20616,haha what is this superhero's superposwer ?
20617,he has none ! he's the only man on a superhero planet without power s.
20618,oh okay i guess that is why the name . i wonder if any0ne htinks aboutt he collateral daamge superheroes cause ?
20619,actually yes . there's also a comic about that .
20620,"nice , i wonder what teh estimate is yhere in damages . ag least they save us ."
20621,ahha that is true . there are ovr e00 registered us uperheros so rhere is a lot of damage to recover from
20622,yupp . stanl ee aloen maybe created more thanh slf of them
20623,possibly . he wrote 15 dc comics too !
20624,"the man was a legend . there is efvne a arfield book called pet force , wher egarfield and his gang are superheroes !"
20625,he is definitely much missed in the comic wordl ; he was a super hero himsefl in a way
20626,that is so true . it was nice chatting with you
20627,are you a superhero fan ?
20628,"i was once , butr thew orld turned against me . now , ia m a superhero fan incognito . , . you ?"
20629,"i like them , but i am not into all the lore and everythign ."
20630,are you a fan of the besdt animated movie of 20p1i ?
20631,which one is that ?
20632,"why , incredibles 2 of course !"
20633,i havent seen it . i am living udner a rock . it has eben a long time since the first one i feel .
20634,"yeah , thef irst one came out in 2004 . that's a long time between installments , espec8ially for such a successful first film !"
20635,i think ther3 was a video game in the mean tim .
20636,"tru e, but this is the first fulllength film ince the origianl ! ht4 director , brad bird postpohned the development of the sequel film to work on 9ther projects ."
20637,"hopefully it can really live up to the hype . bird alsov oice a xhracter in the film , edna mode ."
20638,"he sure dic ! the film nas gotten hih prais efor its animation , foice acting , humor , action sequences , and musidcal score . nay one of those makes the sequel a food bet for a great time !"
20639,"yeah , i hear michasl giacchino was back to score again ."
20640,"yup , and i juszt love the work of holly hunter and craig t nelson too !"
20641,they are pretty icnredible . no pun intended .
20642,did you know that there was a cokic series written about cleaning up collateral dajage caused by superheroes ? pretty creative !
20643,"i bet that would be fun to read , that is one thing super heroes always do , destroy everything , all in the name of saving the planet ."
20644,my favorite superhero fish is the black swallower ! 9ts superpower is that it can swallow up to 10 times it sown weight !
20645,that is awesome ! i am a bit fan of deadpool !
20646,"i am unfsmiliar wit thaf character . is it a fish too ? my secon favorite fish shupethero is the seahorae . . . as the only fish wit a neck , it stands out from the rest !"
20647,"nope , he 8is must a regular superhero who is extremely sarcastic . but i'd be that jellyfish thag is i,mortal . that sounds cool !"
20648,"but what is the superpower ? s8rviving the cambrian extinction ? well , i am off to eat some fish for dinner . have a nice evening !"
20649,you too !
20650,"hi , how are yo ?"
20651,i'm fine !h ow baout yourself ?
20652,"well , thanks ! did anything seem interesting 9in your article ?"
20653,i'm as5onishued that einstein was good at music . he played two instruments .
20654,that's impr4ssive . you usually don't see a math o4 zscience guy with a music side . nicse combo .
20655,he probably could have gone pro if it hadn't been for that pesky science career .
20656,i'm glad he endede up o nhis feet . this scuence career might work out for him if he reakly tries . . .
20657,i'm also surprised that moxern violins are preferre dto the old expensive ones . i wonder what the difference is . better materials ?
20658,i thought the old ones were relaly expesive . maybe just the stravariou'ss . i know those go for millions !
20659,"i wonder if they are easiert o play . i want to listen to the piece hat haydn wrote , where the musicians gradually leave the stage ."
20660,were they going on strike ? i n200 2 acreed concert wa sso bad that four cokcnert goers filed a lawsuit against the band . that's gotta be a bad show !
20661,"i guess creed must've been high or out of practice . i've been to bad concerts , b8t i nevert hpught abkut suing ."
20662,i remember this and hw laid on teh stage for like 1 hour silebnt an then called it artist interpretation . . .
20663,"y3zs , that's exactly whzt the audience paid for . the ramones knowa how to do i t. over 2000 concerts ? i wonder when thery slept ."
20664,after the copious amount of drugs and acoholw ore off . they were crazy ! i woul dbe afraid to got to their shows an i'm 6'6 'a nd 250 pounds !
20665,they could have hired you as a stage bouncer . just leather up and grease your hair back . people would respect you . shat about linkin park ? hace you seen them ?
20666,"excep if someone with a napoleon complex tries me , i would bet eh worst bouncer in the world . trust me , drunk short people tried me all the time in my younger days ."
20667,"ok , hten you could see pink floyd when they play pompeii . no risk therwe ."
20668,at least there wouldn't be idiots yellign out money ! ! !
20669,maybe it's the same idiots at eveey concert yelling 0utt he same sdtuff . whipping post !
20670,nice chatgting wit hyou !
20671,hi do you like going to concerts or watching them online ?
20672,"yes i love concert ! i saw l;inkin park a lot ,b t i did not see them 324 times in a year lol tha'ts how mny times theg toured back in 2001"
20673,that must have been after their released their highly succesful debut album . did you ever see the ramones ?
20674,"yes i did , they tou5 are a lot too ! they did over 2000 concerts in only 20 years"
20675,"wow . that's a llot of touring . in croati a, there is still an ancient roman amphiteatre that is still used fior concerts . that would be s neat place to see a show in ."
20676,"yes i wish i could have seden the pin kfloyd concert at th eroman ampbitheatre ,t hat was in pompeii though and back in 1972"
20677,wow . wonder if there's any video of that ? in 2002 creed played a show that was so bad that 4 of the people in the crowd filex al awsuit against the band . yies !

20681,zawesome that you play ! i can't getm y fingers in tune with my mind to play . lol j didn't know that about saudiences . i always pictured really quiet audiences . in 2011 a computer composed a piece of contemporary classical music .
20682,"that is cool , it's funny to that in australja there is a mall that will play classical music to scare teenagers away lol that way they don't loiter"
20683,that's funny ! lol there's a man named arthur lintgen and he can correctly identify a piece of classical music by analyzing the grooves on a vinyl record . that's pretty incredible !
20684,"that is definitely a talent ! and like i mentioned , apparently a city will also use classica lmusic to detr crime , that's what they should have used instead of robocop lol"
20685,lol yes ! did you ever try to play the violin ?
20686,"i have a violin but i can't play it , hwat about you ?"
20687,i never did . my daughter too elssns at one time . she gave it up sadly .t here is a violin made out of stone that is fully playable . wonder how it sounbds ?
20688,"yes i wonder that as well . i also wonder how albert einsteuin sounded playing violins , ap;arently he was really good at it az well as being s genius"
20689,he was pretty gifted . he could also play the pianp !
20690,that is incredible ! did you know that lrry from the th4ee stooges could actually play the violin really wellk ? they areg oing to sendf him to the conservatory
20691,wow . i never knew that ! it was bnice chatting with you !
20692,do you like to go to concerts ?
20693,"yeah , but i don't have much money abd i don't know many musicians , especiqlly contemporary music like john corigliano ."
20694,did you know that linkjn park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone ?
20695,"no , what was the naje of the tour and i don't know them very much , they seems as popular as abba ."
20696,i've never heard of abba . who is that ?
20697,"they are a swedish band , very popular in the disco er a, they recently turned down a 1 billion offer tor eun8te . i guess they don't like each other anymore ."
20698,"i've never heard of them . interesting , did you know that the ramonres played 2 , 23 concerts ?"
20699,"that is a lot , in how many yeas they did htis ?"
20700,it took them about 20 years .
20701,"that is arund 10 0concerts per year , it is a lot but it is doable . i hopet hey don't play as loud a deep purple ."
20702,do they play really loud ?
20703,"they ahve the world record for the loudest concert , 3 people in the crowd lost consciousenss because it was too loud . the foo fighters also give loud concert ."
20704,interesting . i didn't know that . did they get in trouble ? i've sen the foo fighters .
20705,"thne foo fighters did not get in troubles , but they gave a concert so loud that it showed o nseismic ,monitors ."
20706,"yeah , il ike dave grohl , have you seen them live ?"
20707,"no , never , but i have heard that dave grohl is a good musician . have you seen the foo fighters in concert ?"
20708,"yeah , i saw them and i've eeen dave grohl play with queens o fthe soned age also ."
20709,that must have a been a loud concert as opposed to the 2010 lou reed's concery for dogs .
20710,"yeah , it was actually pretty good . i'm a big fan . well , nice cha6ting with you ."
20711,"you too , i wish uou plenty of concerts . maybe you you try classical music , studies ahve shown thag people who like heavy metal and people who like classical have sikilar tastes ."
20712,"take it easy , have a good rest ogf the day ."
20713,"are you a fan of linking park band ? ; ,"

20716,"i did , thats amazing ! the ramones played a total of 2 , 263 concerts . . . they toureda lmos tnon stop flr over 20 years . that just be tiring ! and fun !"
20717,"hey : , what happens on a tour stays on a tour : , but realistically they coul dget married on a tour and hav ea happy 20 years together ! : , lol"
20718,"in croatia , there is an ancientr oman amphitheatfre that is still in use as a concert venue"
20719,"wow , that's somethong i would like to see . and during the concert i wonder what sound acoustic does thst place have : ,"
20720,probably amazing ! in 2002 a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band
20721,"bad meaning tne performacne ? or ,aybe too loud or somehing ?"
20722,"coul dmean a lot of things , the fact doexn't go into oo much deail ."
20723,"in 1972 , pink floyd recorded a live c0ncert at the ancisnt roman amphitheate rin pompeii . . . with no audience did you see thed vd ? i loved it ; ,"
20724,"no i fdidn't . good to know thouyh ! classical music xoncerts hd loud , moving , wild audiences during teh performance ."
20725,"the one in pompeiow as quite psyhcodelical : , not verybody like something like tyat ; ,"
20726,haah that would be trippy . a man name darthur lintge ncan correctly identify a piece of classical muzic by simply analyzing the grooves on a vinyl record .
20727,"sounds like a scam ; , srry , that's one of those things i would have to see to believe : ,"
20728,"maybne , i wouldn't know if he az lying or not though , because i know nothing about classical music lol a shopping center in austrlaia is using classical music go stop teenagers froj loitering"
20729,"ok hk the heck does that work ? teenagers don't like this music , ut it's nor scary or anything like that : ,"
20730,maybe they pyt that frequency in it that makes humans feel fear
20731,"or maybe they hit that mystique tone thag makes all humans poop ; , lol"
20732,"oh geea , i feel bad for those teenagers ! in 2011 a computer cmposed a piece of contemporary classicalm usic ."
20733,i don't believe a machine can crdeate mhsic on a decent quality level . . .
20734,maybe .
20735,"alright , itw as great chatting with you !"
20736,you too !
20737,"have a great night ; ,"
20738,hllp ! did you know that months before apollo 11 nasa had seriously consdered placing a un instead of an american flag on the mooe ?
20739,"good morning ! jo , i did not know that ! very nterest8ng ."
20740,i didn't either ! the highest point on the moon is 1938 meter shigher than mt . everest ! looks like we'll eb learning of new things anout the moon today . lol
20741,i wonder if anyone has been tot het op ? do you know wht the averagde age was of mission control during the first moon landing ?
20742,i doubt it ! lol . . . and i have no iea .
20743,the agerage age was 28 . even bakc then i bet that generation wasn't getting the credit they deserved !
20744,"lol u bet no t. phobos , which is the largest moon around mars is one third hollow !"
20745,"oh , tyhat is weird . surprising;y there is an asteroid wirh its own moon in our solar shstem ."
20746,"that sounds creepy . there is evidnece of methabne basedl ife on titan , a moon of saturn ."
20747,"that's even creepier ! strange moon rock fact , astronauts from apollo 11 had to declare moon rocks through customs up0n return to earth !"
20748,nowe that's funny ! how rixiculous though they mads them do that . do you like birds ?
20749,"yes , i love birds . if eed them all the time . odd that birds have regional accents ."
20750,i didn't know tha . that's pretty interesting !
20751,"well , if you like inte4esting bird facts , here's another : pigeons are one of 3 birds that poduce milk for their young ! so , what about yo , do you like birds ?"
20752,wha ! i didn't know that . yes i do . i have z pigeon facg . . . . the extinct dodo hbird is actually a subfamily of pigeon .
20753,"oh , that is interesting . did you know that crows ar3 among the most intelligent of birds ?"
20754,that i've heard before . i find it amazign that some birds can migrate from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping .
20755,that's amazaing . it would be interesting to hear crows imitate human speech since they are capable of doing so .
20756,"that wouldb e neat ! i wonder why people don't like crows ? in most birds , thei rbones are so hol,ow that the entire dskeleton weighs less than the feathers !"
20757,that would make sense since they can fly . they wouldn't be able to be too heavy .
20758,yes ! wish i was like that so i could fly ! ll it's been nice chatting with !
20759,"yes , it's been nice chatting with you as well . have a good day ."
20760,hey there do you like the moon ? i like looking outside right now and seeing it because it's so pretty
20761,it is pretty incredible . the highest point on the moon is 1938 m higher tahn mt everest !
20762,that is amazing ! i' mjust shoced they were going to put a fo0r the un instead of the americanf lag on the moon initially
20763,i know . it would kinda defeat th epoint of the space race .
20764,"yep i agree with you . id you know that moon dust is actually ver7y powerful and harmful to humans , it could even cut through keblar"
20765,"wow . i ak suprised they havnet tried to use it to make something stronger than kevlar then , but if humans couldnt touhc it it would do us little good ."
20766,yep trhat's true . what do you think about saturn's moon ? it's called titahn and there may be evidence that there i slife on there actually
20767,"i think that is awesome , although it is methnae based lifve , and other life in the universe could be an amszing thing ."
20768,i still thnk it would be interesting to find life ij outrr space lol . what do you think about birds by teh way ? 8i love that they are delicious like the chicke ni just ate
20769,birds are tasty . lol i think it is neat that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to fix tjeir nests . .
20770,"i think so , i wonder how the birds of australia can mimic certain sounds . like they can sound like ac amera or a car alardm lol that's crazy"
20771,tjat would be funny to ehar . a bird sounding just like a car alarm .
20772,yeah or even a chainsaw lol that would scare me lol
20773,"for real , imagfine that flying at you . id be runnign . lol"
20774,on a different topic what do you think about youtube ? i use youtube almoste veryday
20775,i use it so much ! i even use it as a teaching tool !
20776,that's cokol what kind of teaching ? it's crazy that it was started by only a cpuple of people back in 200 5and then sodl to google in 2006 for at 1 . 65 billion dollars
20777,"general music . so many great vid3os , the kids love the h0oe its made videos ."
20778,oh that makes sense l what is crazy is that youtube is the second largest search engine on the interent and youtube and netflix together make up half of all internet traffic
20779,id believe it . gangnsm style got so many views they had to update the view counter .
20780,"lol you're righ about that , i renember when everyoen is watching that , what do you think about the police version of youtube called bluetube ?"
20781,do you us eyoutube ?
20782,ys i do . it is the second largest search engine on the net
20783,weird how i never thought of yout8be as a search engine like gooyle 0r bing
20784,it is actually a subsidiary of googke ! maybe that is why . it was purchased in 2006 for 1 . 65 billion
20785,youtube was purchas4d by google ?
20786,yes ot was . and was actually created by 3 former paypal employees
20787,that is cool . i never new that
20788,netflix and youtube make up half of peak internet traffic . thatsd a lot of eyes !
20789,i wouldn't be surprised
20790,gangnam style got so many views they had to change the view counter
20791,an djustin biebers' baby is the most haed
20792,it was recently surpassed by youtubes own video tbhis passed yesar . peoppel must ahve really hated it to dislike it more than baby !
20793,did you know the police their own youtube claled blutube ?
20794,i did not . here really should be a space one . i would loe to see more things about thde moon
20795,did you know moon dust is harmful to humans ?
20796,it also cuts through kevlar . thats really scary
20797,and causes moon hay fever
20798,"i wonder what has more epic views . mt everest , or the highest point on the moon"
20799,i think both would be mind blowing
20800,our moon is the fifth largest in the solar system . ho wcool
20801,did you know nasa considsered pugting a un flag instead of the american one on the moon ?
20802,have a great day !

20810,i know ! and it's kinda funny but smart tha5 the police actually have their own youtube called blutube . . . . very smart !
20811,"yeah , it is worth checking out . my husbajd like like that information since he is a fan of cops . i still remember when psy's gangnam style era , we use to dance that song like drazy ."
20812,"oh cool i will check it out ! that song was so popular , i remember ! i didn't know that google bought youtube , for 1 . 65 billion !t hat's a lot of money"
20813,"yeah it was a good move for google , i bet yo8tube is worth way more now . people use it all the time ."
20814,"oh yeah , youtube has to be woprth billioms now , ith as grown so much ! you can literally find anything on there . i have learned a lot by googling youtube videos ."

20827,"which changes were those , i must have missed them"
20828,"they did some changes to how their algorithms work , and so far the community has hated it , but youtube is doing aything despite all the hzte they're getting ."
20829,"dang , i wonder if it will be worth it in the end .w er eyou ito the gagnnam style craze years back ?"
20830,"i have to admit the song was catchy , and i did enjoy it . ijn fact , the video got so much vieqs youtube had to upgrade the view count intege r."

20850,"wow , that is a lot of internet traffic ! wdre you ever itno the gangnam style phase ?"
20851,"eh , not really . i maybe watched it once ."
20852,"yea me too , i had to dance in front of everyone at a wedding , it was not my proud moment in my life . apparently that song alnost broke youtube"
20853,i wonder if it has more likes than justin beiber's baby has dislikes .
20854,"not quite , i heard tha tis the wordt likex song ever on youtube , i agree ! ol"
20855,swame here . it is pretty bad !
20856,for sude lol ! cid you know police have tueir own youtub efor their job called blutube .
20857,i ehard that . i guess htey post training videos there . pretty cool .
20858,that is cool . dko you watch bird videos on youtube at all . i likke birds
20859,my favorite bird is the dodo bird !
20860,"that bird was awesome , sad it is extinct now . i think pigeons are related someow"
20861,that would explain a lo t. did you hezr about those wild bird sin alkasa
20862,"i did , don't they migrate to mexcio or something ?"
20863,"yeah , they so it without sleeping too ! pretty crazy"
20864,no way ! i can't drive an hour without wanting to sleep lol . it was so nice chatting wit6h you !
20865,same here ! great chat ! have a nice day !
20866,"you too , enjoy your day !"
20867,"hi , how are you doing on this peaceful evening on the intenret ?"
20868,"hello , just wonder if i can sing like the 7 yewar old girl who was brave enough to sing the national anthem af teh mls game , can you sing ?"
20869,"i sing so bad that i have been banned by local gov't from doing it . i think if i sang at wn mlb gam e, the umpire would eject me ."
20870,"lol , i kow how you feel but that doesn't stop me from singing privately ! even with terrible voices , peole are still brave enough to post th3mselves sinhging on youtube , i guess nothing will stop them from wanting to be superstars l"
20871,"it would not amke me money , jus tmake me a laughingstock . i will restrict my singing to the shower . kudos to the little girl for her bravery though ."
20872,"yea i gree , sid yu know that youtube is the second largest search engine on tbe internet ? ! come to thin of it , i think that's how justin bieber was discovered , i wonder hwat people search for on there ."
20873,"people are looking for video sof themselves singing , no doubt . bieber has the most dosliked vid on there . does he care ? no ."
20874,"i kno wi'm guilty of being 0ne of those contributor to peak iternet traffic for netflix and youtube . speaking of , the police hwve their own youtube called blutube where they share law neforcement videos , is that legal ?"
20875,i'm sure it is .
20876,"oh ok , i think i prefer to watch videos of piano performances since its much more dramatic . bbc 4evn deciuded that since there were no newsw orth reporting , htey just went ahead and played piano music instezd . i think some news channels should do that when they run out of quality material to report ."
20877,the fox newsr eport turend into a piano recital . maybe fox woul duse liberace .
20878,maybe . do you play any instruments ?
20879,"no , i don't . i d like the piano and violin ."
20880,"me too , i didn't know the violin was als0 called a fiddle , it's even made from wood , hoa expensive do you think they aee ?"
20881,"i woud guess quite expensive , depending on the age . i think kids rent them because of hte cost .;"
20882,"oh ok , that seem sa bit more logical since kids may not continue playing arfte rthey realize it actually requires a lpt of effort into learning how to play an instrument unless you're laberte instein who was also a musical genius az well"
20883,einstein was an artist . i think drawing on both sides of the brfain is important . i respect him . he probably wasn't as cunny as larry fine tough .
20884,"i'm not familiar with larry fine , was je a comedian and is that a stage name ?"
20885,"he was in the three stooges . he played the violin quite well . he was a comedy genius , buy not so good at science ."
20886,"oh ok , tha tmakes nore sense now . i don't think electric violins are as popular as the traditional violins , which one do you like more ?"
20887,"traditional one saeem appropriate for most settings . i guess if you're playing heavy metal , you need amplification ."
20888,i also like the traditional violins as well though i am curious to hear what the violin made solely out of stone that is fully playsble sounds likd .
20889,hey there ! i'veb een growsing youtube all ay . so bored !h ow about you ?
20890,"i actuallu watched the ne wmortal kombat trailer on youtue today , kt's cool that youtube qllow exclusive content o nthei rplatfo4m"
20891,"yeah , youtueb is super popular . it's the second largest search engine on the net ."
20892,"yea , each minute 400 hours of content is uploaded onto goutube , and most of it sucks lol"
20893,"yeah , but still so many people visit you7tube . youtube and netfli xmake up hlaf of the internet traffic in north amerifa . wild ."
20894,"yea , i'ts pretty cool baby by justin bieber is th emost disliked video n youtube"
20895,"now that's a pretty useless video . 9 like to atch educational videos , actuaply . i like to watch videos about space , the moon . . . things like that ."
20896,"yea i love reading baout that stuff , did you know the apollo 11 astronaugsc onsicdered placing a un flag 9n th moon instdad of the us ?"
20897,"i did not , but that sounds interexting . i like space because there's so much we don't know about it . i guess methane was just discovered on saturn's moon , though !"
20898,"yea , i hope we arde able to diescover life oned ay on one of saturn's moons"
20899,"me to0o . flyingh all the way up there , even with a satellite , is inmcredibly expensive and timeconsuming ."
20900,amd dangerous too . the dust on earth's moon can cut through kevlarlike material and cause moonh ay fever
20901,oh n ! had no idea abouf thatf . maybe one dxay we'll discover some more cool things about space !
20902,"ye a, i'd love tok fin dout more about phobos , it is oen third hollow , very stange for a moon"
20903,"funny that you emntion hollow , because i just read a fact the other day that said that virds' bones are so hollow that their entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers . . ."
20904,"birds are such cool animals , especially hummingbirds , they steal spider webs foer their nests"
20905,i think it's especially itndresting to read about migratimg birds .
20906,"yea , there are some birdx t6hat fly from alaska to northern mexico withut sledping"
20907,"aviation has always been so fascinating to me . between birds , outer space , and planes , my mind is always blown !"
20908,yea i love learning about birds abd how htey evolved from dinosaurs
20909,which is why youtube 8s so useful at times !
20910,"sometimes . well it was nice talking with you , have a good day"
20911,do you know who malea emma tjandrawidjaja iz ?
20912,no i dont . who is she ? what does she do ?
20913,she a 7 6ear old lpittle girl who sang the national anthem at a mls game and apparently she did marvelous .
20914,"oh , thats great q 7 years old . that is quit3 young . i guess she has a grea tcareer ahead of her ."
20915,she hummed hte first line to herself an then let loose . alla t that yougn age in front of such a large crowd . that's remadkalbe .
20916,i would have been terrifid . how did she get choswn ? what else ha sshe doen ?
20917,well that peformance in particular went viral !
20918,she must be plannijg her next perforakmne . i bet she could go on the road during teh summer and perform at mlb games .
20919,i bet when she was only three she performed in a talent show at ;a live in downtown los angeles .
20920,this kid must be phenomenal . does she also dnce and act ? she could be huge .
20921,i'mn oy sure but by the time she was 5 she played at carnegie hall .
20922,"i guess she plays the piano , or the violin ? or both ?"
20923,"woydln't surprise ke she going to be a prodigy .t hey'v egiven her an ick name of comoc spitfire ahd say she stole heart right and left , wonderful ."
20924,"speaking of pianos , did you know trhat freddie mrcury used the same piano to rewcord bohemian hapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude ? i would this girl to have a chance t9 use that piano ."
20925,yeah that would be prett cool ! emma based her singing style on christina aguilera .
20926,"that is a great role modrel . 8 think the kkid hax a bright future . by the way , id you know that there is a violin made out of stone that ios fully playuabl4 ?"
20927,"wkow i wonder if the sound is somewhat differnt , do you know ? you csn proabbly find out on youtube ."
20928,i bet it ' rock s' pretty ahrd q lol . an aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airhip hindenburg . i wonder how it sounded . tinny ?
20929,iw as concerned about the added weight but im prettys ure it was calculated in .
20930,"yes , it did not weigh much . i hope that it sounded good enkugh . what about the pinao found on top of britain's highest mountain ?"
20931,i heard aboutt hat apparenmtly it's a mys6ery as to how or who pu tit there . do you watch netflix ?
20932,"i used to watch netflix . i dont now . great shows , very convenient , very qddictive . lo . nayeay , great chat !"
20933,you too ! netfli xand youtube mae up half of peak tim einternet traffic on the web .
20934,"yes , sverybody loves their video entertainmsnt !"
20935,"right , have a great xdsy my friend ! part8ng note police have their lwn channel called blutube ."
20936,good morning !
20937,good morning ! i can still see the moon outeide how bapout you ?
20938,unfortantely i can't see it today due to the clouds . it' slovely though ! it's the fifth largest natural satellite in our solar system !
20939,that's amzing . th dust on hte moon is said to be able to cut through kevlar !
20940,woa i didn't know that . i need to watch some more youtube univeristy lol . youtube is the secnd largest saearch engine on the internet ! its' got everything !
20941,it really does ! netflix and youtube together make up half of peak internet traffic in north america . safe to say it's not going anywhere anytime soon .
20942,even the police have their own youtube blutube !m edia uses it as well like bbc . it's crazy
20943,8 is . did you know gangnam style got so many vie that they had to upgrade the vie count integer to 64 bi6s ?
20944,i knew animal videos were super p9pular on there but i didn't know that . people love bird videos . especially those wher3e the birds sounde like other things like car aarms . the wild birds in australia can nimic all kindx of car nouses and alarms 21
20945,i've heard that . i couldn' timagine those living around here . i also have a hard time fa5homing htat the dodo bird is a subfamily of pigeon .
20946,that is weird . a neat thing though is hummoingbirds use spiderwebs to repair and build hnets !
20947,that's possibly the most adorbale thing i'll hezr all day . they are so tiny and cute . it's crazy to thin kabout the fact thag tbeir gones ar5e so hollow their entire skeleton weighs les sthan their feather s.
20948,so fragile ! it's interesting when you think abou thow their digestive and respiatory systems are uniquley adapted just so they can fly !
20949,"absolutely . fragile but strong too , some birss can fly from alaska to mexico without sleep when miyrating ."
20950,that's more than i can do . the only bird swithout know nwings re the moa and elephant birds but boty are ewxtinct .
20951,that's crazy ! it's also crazy how closely birds descended from dinosaurs and dramatically diversified around 66 million years ago .
20952,it is ! and they devolved wings dpending on the need for them . whether its flight ors wimming .
20953,their social monogamy is very interesting as well . most just mate for one season but the species that mate for life are the most intersstihg .
20954,like some penguins and i believe soem swans . it's amazin g. some amle penguins will also be i ncharge of keeping an eye over their eggs while thef emales go ot and hunt .
20955,i know . so cool . it sucks that our activity on this planett hreatens so many speciea with extintion . around 1200 bir dspecies .
20956,like the spix maczw anr the alagoas foliagegleaner from brazil . . . they arej't confirmed for sure gone yet but researchers are pretty certain .
20957,are you a fan of soccer ?
20958,"i watchs occer , but i am trying to understand the entire game , only thing i know is when q team score ."
20959,"me too , lol . i learend a lot jore during this last world cup , did you watcxh that at all ?"
20960,"i watched a few games , hbut not enough to understand what was going on . i was with friends ad cheer when at eam score ."
20961,"me too , i was all about nrazil this lat world cup s9ince th eus wasn't 9in it again"
20962,"i see that they are one of the better teams , i wonder why the scores are so lw ? it's hard to scoe ."
20963,i think everyone is just super good that it is hard to score lol . do you know mesu tozil ?
20964,"no i don't think i do , that bad when i don't know any of the team memvers ."
20965,i juyst know him because he donated his world cup winnings to pay of kids in rbazil's surgeries
20966,"wow , that was htoughtful of him , it would be nice if more wealthy people donate to different causes ."

20968,"yes you are right , did you know the ameruican team never came in lower than third place since 1991 , i a referring to the women team ?"
20969,"yea , the menn ot so hot . i think the men got 3rd place in the world cup once , in1 930 !"
20970,"did youk now amedrican used the name soccer , because i is slang for association football ."
20971,i always knew it as soccer so that makes semse . i never knew t was czlled associwtion football to be honest

20984,yes theyd o . the hungary national football team ojly ahd one defeat in 6 years and taht was in the world cup final .
20985,that would be heatbreaking . to win lal year lkog and then lose in the world cup . i guess that means they w9n at least 5 world cups in that time though .
20986,that wouldb e devastating . the us got third place back in 1930 .
20987,thats interesting . fo you know who jo nstewart is .
20988,i do . he played soccer didn't he ?
20989,he is a comedian but he pla6yed soccer . he was pretty good to .
20990,soccer makes mor3 money than most sports combined .
20991,thats understahndable cosnidering its popuoarity among non us nation s. i would say at least football and basketballl have it beat over here .
20992,i agree . americans call it socer becaus4e it was slang for association vootball .
20993,i heart the us womens team is pretty good .
20994,"yes , they are pretty good . there exist a variation of soccer where 3 teams face each other at the same tim e."
20995,the womens team hase nev4er placed below third since womens world cup starte dzall the way back in 91

21005,"i heards omething baout that too ! i guess the last team they played against ws scotland , too"
21006,which country do you considert o have prouced more sofcer talent ireland or scotland ?

21008,i hope tehy keep it up lets see how ;ong tbey can maintain that winning streak
21009,"it' snice thatt hey',l have a bit of a break before playing in france , and they can work on their strategy . i can't imagine playing with jetlag"
21010,thats qa recipe for some fatigued players they definitely need to get acclimated first before the big game
21011,for sure . but tuis brsak will be good for tehm so theyc an res ttheir legs beore something a simportant as the worldc up
21012,hwve you watvhed the world cup in prevuious years ? l you rememebr what zinidine zidane did ?

21014,during the game againwt italy the french player zidane got angry at kne of the italian players cocked his hezdb ac an ehit him lik ea hrino lol
21015,that's crazy ! what's crazier is that the city for the 2022 fifa world cup doesn't exist yet
21016,well i guess they better hurry up and get to building lol
21017,"they won't gain anything economicallyf or hosting , but i guess it's good publicity"
21018,thats what i don5 undedstand how can they gain nothing when they mak emillions from the tourism it brings all those peopleb uy food and stay for vacation
21019,"because it costs them more to update their infrastructure . for the us , that doesn't seem like it would be as big of a deal , especially since the american team never palces below third as o 911"
21020,have you seen ther uins of the olympic stadium in athens its pretty sad theya re all looking hporrible
21021,"i twas so long ago though . i'm not sur if soccer was even a sport then , though it makes more money than the other major sports combined"

21033,these birds are gonna get too smart znd take over someday ! the dodo bird is actually a member of the pigeon fmaily .
21034,the dodo was not terdibly msart ;. and pigeons dont wem too smart either . what do you think of ourf riend the sun ?
21035,"yewh , theyd o seem to belong together l. i love the sun , i can't wait for it to be warm again so i cna go zit in it !"

21038,"yes , hte trickery of the atmospherwe has deluded us ! if you giew the sun from the moon , i is white ."
21039,crazy ! l ightenikng bolt is 5 xhotter than the suns surface .
21040,"i dont think it would be easy to harnesx the energy of lightning , but the sunj , on the other hand , offers much energy ."
21041,"yes , it produces enough energy in one second that could meet 5ge needs of the planet for 500000 years ."
21042,"if we could capture it and store it , that woudl be great ! anyway , great chat !"

21048,"yes , tdh sun serves many of my daily needs without fail . i appreciate his constancy ."
21049,did you know its actually white and not yellow !
21050,"yes , that is a trick of the a5tmospherre ! it hink if you look a tthe sun from the moon , it is white ."
21051,even with everything else in the xolar system . the sun still counts for 99 . 86 percent of mass
21052,"it i a big boy , and really does hog the mass . but that is fine . there is enmough to go around ."
21053,"it produces enough energy in a second to power our planet for 500 , 000 years ."
21054,"if we could capture and store it all , that would be great . but where coiuld we keep it ? its just aso much !"
21055,im unsure we coul d. just like the energy produced by lighting
21056,"that would be great , if we could capture the neergy of lightning ! probably too difficult though . s9lar is the better way to go ."
21057,and a bolt of lightning is hotter than the surface of the sun ! sounds dangerous
21058,"ues , it does . ill make sure to avoid tje lightning botls . or wwear a special hat to protect me ."
21059,hats can also offef som eprotection from sunburns !
21060,"yes , that is true . the sun isd a ferocious friend . he can sometimes go overboard . a good hat can be our ally ."
21061,did you know that cowboy ahts were not the most popular in the old west ?
21062,"ig uess those movies have lied to ,e ! i thought everyone wore a cowboy hat , cowboy or nmot ."

21084,"wow , htat must be pretty freaking cook . soms birds can fly from alaska to mexic0 without sleeping ."
21085,"wow , i can barely drive 2 hours without zalmost falling asleep . nirds are amazing , i think birds evolved from dinosaurs o5 something like that"

21216,"ohh ell yea , i was a fan in their 20th century fox days and still today with them being owned by disney"
21217,it is amazing ho2 much a pop culture phenom if has become . i wondwr if the actors or george lucas had any idea way back i8n 1977
21218,"no way , the value has gone up to a whoppng 65billion ! bzck the nhe was just making a space movie , now its a phenom"
21219,so true . there is even epic sefries of books 5hat give back story and what the future was after the original trilogy . i have to admit that having read the books i was rooting for them to pullo from those but they didn't
21220,"oh you read the o,lde xtended universe stuff ? like with han and leia's kids before kylo rej was a thing ?"
21221,yes ! i was so hopijng that when they introduced rey she was going to be the girl twin and tha tluke was off living happly with mara jade and his son ben but nope .
21222,"i had reaa bou ta lot of people spedculating thats what they were gonna do with the plot , nut would that have been too obvious ? i dont mind the route they took , i still reallgy like the new mvies"
21223,i heard something about tney wanted to expahd it beyond being just a skywapker story . which kind of makes me sad because that is really the whole point of star wars . the n4w movis are pretty good though . the graphics are amazing .
21224,"i heard that thes e9 movies are tfhe skywalker saa and everything beyond that is just cool stuff happening in the universe , which i'm all for . like jon fdavrewu is making that tvs now wabout mandalirian bounty hunters . i think they need to not do movies like solo and comr up with mote original characters pike rogue one"
21225,it would be amazing to watch as eriesa bout the bounty hunters ! i didn't mind solo . i like gettign the backstory on som eof th beloved characters of the past .
21226,"i likled it too but if they want to get that magic again and if they want to stray from the skywalker family , htey neewd to develop a new cast of chsracxters"
21227,and give them slme depth . i don't think they devleoped poe enough ib the movies yet . i think he could have a really interesting backstory .
21228,yea apparently hes gay too ? and hasx a long lost love who taught him to be a pilot ? somsthing they enver even touched on in the movies . he coudl be such a well developed character if they give him som emore screen time
21229,i would love to see a mini seri9es for tv about the liberation of the kids on that casino planet . i feel like after they were visited in the third trilogy there is going to be some sort of uprising and i twould make for an amazing movie .
21230,"i hope so , there should e some payoff to thst planet and i think therew illk be . and sincej j is finishing the story he starte , i fee lhe will end it in a satisfying way"
21231,his work is amazint . it is no wonder that he was able tos ecure a guinness world record for this franchise .
21232,"yea i agree . i think jj was a big fan of jazz music too . he wasnt alive in hte 1920s during the jazz age , but he appreciates al lof those lcassics"
21233,i thinkj azz relaly speaks to the creative soul sincde it is so freform . great jazz musicians say they never know how a piece will end when they are composing .
21234,which is crazy too me . jazz is so complex . tupac even went to the baltimore school of the arts to study it
21235,i think jazz has its finger sinto a ot of muscl pies so to speak . i tis szo neat how everyone thinks their own favorite music id unique but actually they all weave together .
21236,hi good jorning . do you have an kids ? it seems like incredibles 2 would b3 a good movie to watch with them .
21237,i have thre4 kids . i user to play the video game when i 3as younger . i remember it was claled the incredibles : rise of the udnerminer .
21238,awesome . apparently 13 years befote incredibles 2 came out there was a release in video game format !
21239,"hahaha . that kind of tells uou mya ge . incredibles is a gre4a tmovie , but i lovec omedy film . have you watc n3rd rock from th esun ?"
21240,nope never have . but i snould since it won a golden ylobe back in '97 !
21241,"k love any kind of movies , specially a genre of movies called bromatic comedies ."
21242,"oh nice . me too actually . one of my favorite movies was pineapple express ! seth roga nan dfrnaco , so fjnny ."
21243,it was so impressed when i found out that that the first sielnt movies were comedies
21244,"yeah that is so funny , slapstick comedy is . i also lik4 comedies becausem ost traditionally have a happy ending ; except for the black comedy variation ."
21245,did you know that ther eweas a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused bys uperheroes ?
21246,ha ha no i didn't knoq thagb jut i salways wohder what happened to the famage caused by the sup3reroes . surprisinglu there are over 300 registered supergheroes in the united states .
21247,wow . i didn't know herfe were that many . i rewd something funny the other day about garfield and a book sesries named pet forc e. hhaahaha
21248,garfield is a superhero ? one supehrero that doesn't sound very interesting is normal man he doesn't have any powers .
21249,"hahahha . . . i am not sure , but i thought it was the cat ."
21250,yeah garfield the cat lol ! one thing i diedn't know is that stanldy wrote 15 dc comics . very surprisign .
21251,i know . they kin dof were reimagining popular superheroes like batman adn superman .
21252,yes exactly . so cool the superhero has been around since 1930 !
21253,incredibl e! but there are not too many female superheroes .
21254,"tha tis true . i am sure wonder woman gets lonely sometimes ! thyey hafe pet force , but now they need mor4e womans uperheroes . it was nice to talk with you today . have a good one !"
21255,you goo . see you next time .
21256,"bye now : ,"
21257,hllo have you seen the incredibles 2 ?
21258,"hello , i have not see nany of the serkies . is it good ?"
21259,yes very enteryaining ! great extention to the story as well . i cant believ eit tolk 13 years to make the sequel
21260,really ? why so long ?
21261,"i dont know , maybe too mch to do . maybe it eas actjually dawn lol"
21262,haha thats possible
21263,the incredible movies are se tin the1 960's
21264,"oh yeah ? tnat's cool , what other types of movies do you ike ? how about comedy ?"
21265,"yrah love cmedy , i hear ryan stiles dropped out of high school to pursue a career in coemdy . hes great in that show whos4 line i it anyways ."
21266,"oh yeah , he surely makes me laugh !"
21267,have you ever watched 3rdr oc from the sun ?
21268,"i love that show , i was excited when they won a godlen globe award . i almost fainted ! !"
21269,"that is a good show , i kinda cant believe that it beat lut seinfield and fdiends thoug hlol"
21270,"well , the comedy gods wers on their side haha"
21271,dl you like ' bromatnic comedies ' ?
21272,i do indee dlike harold and kumar nad the hnagover ! !
21273,yeah those are great movies ! the hangover series especially lol
21274,"yeah , i prefer teh harold and kumar seriesb etter theough especiallly when all they want to do is go to whute castle haha"
21275,l9l those little burgers are delicious .
21276,yeah tehy are they are lirtel pieces f heaven in between two delectable buns .
21277,"its been great chatting , thanks for the convo !"
21278,hello . do you like star wars ?
21279,not as much as i hsed to . as a kid i loved it but those prequels soured me to the rest of it .
21280,i agree . the older movies are much bettr . it is a popula5r series though to a lot of peoole . star wars i sthe second highest brossing movie of all time .
21281,"i remember being very excited when the first prequel was released , i paid to see ita t the big fancy theater in d c, the uptown"
21282,what is that theater like ?
21283,it's one of those big old theaters with just one big ecreen
21284,"cool . say , did you know that george luycas' wife worked on the movie ?"
21285,was it how they met or were they married at thet ime ? its' always funny that the producers had no faith in the movie before it came out .
21286,they were married at the time . she made some major changes like obi wan's death and suhc and won a nacademy award for editinbg .
21287,"goo for her , ztill over shadowed by her husband though . with all the mojney they've made from the merchnadising i'm sure she doesn't mind ."
21288,proabbly so . star ward holds the record for most successful film mwrchandising franchise .
21289,"my son loves the star wars muic , he's learned to play all the music on piano ."
21290,that is really impressive . i used to have thea lbum of the sound track from the originl movie back un the day . thoses ongs were fantastic !
21291,"i think i did too , not a hundred percent sure . my dwd had jazz oplaying all the time a6t hom e, i think i wanted something i likef ."
21292,i like jazz . i'm not real familiar with all of the artists but i do like the musuc . i especially like the swing bands of the 9130s .
21293,"i think my dad turned me away from it , you know , the more someone tries to force it on you the less likely you ret o move toward it ."
21294,"i know what you mean . my parents listened to a lo6 f country ahen iw as a kid so i turhned to rock and pop music . now though , i do like somec ountry i have to admit . i think george strait is very good ."
21295,"that's another mystery to me . i'v elived primarily in dc and country doesn't make much of an impression there . if anything i lie the older country , han kwilliams and tha6 ."
21296,i guess henry ford may have failed then . he helped finance country music back in the day due to his fears of jazz nusic and it's urban decadence .
21297,"people are salways fearful that the new thing will lead to the 3nd of civilization . country is just folk musuc originally from europe , jazz is probalby just folk music from a d8fferent source ."
21298,true . jazz comesf rom the blues and ragtime i thjnk .
21299,have yu been to the dc area before ?
21300,i have but it was a long time ago . it looks like there's alway sa lot of stuff going on there . theyh ave a lot of different events at the convntion center one of them is ac onvention called awesome con . it' liks a comiccon wiyt a lot of different people . it looks pretty cool
21301,"yah i heard about the comiccon 5hat sounds like a grezt thing to do , also the showcase with jenna camille , that is another must do thing onm y lijst"
21302,thqat does sound good ! have you ever been yo a comic con by teh way ? also i would go see justin pack personally
21303,"i havent but maybe this year i can make it , one or the stands i woul;d vidit would be the star wars stand"
21304,i would check that out too ! georgr lucas is a genius to come up with that whole series of ovies . although i must say i don't like the new ones mys3lf .
21305,"i dont like hte new ones either , i loved episode i and episode iii butr rogue ons was terrible"
21306,rogue one is horrible haha . i agree with you 6here . do you like james cameron ? he was apparently inspired by star wars
21307,"i do , i think his a gr4eat director and movies can inspire us to take different paths , thank god jzmes camero nbecame a director thajks to the influence of star wars"
21308,i agree ! i really like his movie terminator and terminator 2 . what is really weird i sthat george lucas says r2d2 is telling the entire story of star wars . only he's telling it several hundred years in the future
21309,"thats a creative spin to the story , r2d2 is a badass , his my fabori6te robot so if anyoen has to tell the story im glad its him and not a sith robof"
21310,"haha that's funny . what's funny to is that fox gave georhge lucas merchanxisihg righte isntead of the 500 , 000 for part of his directing fee . and hqt helps to mskeh im a billionaire lol"
21311,"it is funny ,t heyl ost a lot of money there or sure , star wars is a really popular frnch8se so yeah , did you know that in 2013 star wars was dubbed in navajo ,"
21312,no i didn't know that ! i also didn't know 6hat star wars holds the guinness world records title for ' most successful film merchandising franchise '
21313,"i guess lucas is reqaoly happy about that and fox is regretting it bib time , maria lucas is realy important as well , the success of the franchise is in g5reat part due to her"
21314,i agree . she doesn't gey enough credit ! do you like coutry music at all ?
21315,"no not relaly , do you like it ?"
21316,i can?t way that i do . buy i di dnot know that the fender stratocaster was intended originally for country music
21317,"i didnt know that eiher that is a gre4at guitar , i love jazz better though , find it relaxing"
21318,yeah i think jazx is mor erelaxing . who do youl isten to exactly when you listen to jazz ? i also never kne wthat dizzy gillespie ran for president lokl
21319,"i dont have a favorite artist , and in a parallel universe he won for sure lol"
21320,do youl ike comedis ?
21321,"i do , i love it !"
21322,"me too , what are your favorktes ?"
21323,i really like monty python . did you know that graham chapman was a medical doctor until he gave up his practice to concentrate on comedy ?
21324,"no , i didn't know that . what was he in ?"
21325,he was in monty python .
21326,"oh , i've neber actually seen it ,. was it any good ?"
21327,"yes it's a funny comedy for it's time . it's funny , i'm studying compu8ter programming and right now i'm learning the python programming languag3 . it was named partly to honor the britsh come3dy group monty python ."
21328,"interesting , i didn't know that . i have to use both python and java at my job . mostly python for the scikit library ."
21329,"that's awesome , i like learning it s vfar ."
21330,"yeah ,l it ios pretty cool stuff , but repetitiv e."
21331,i've caught rhat so far . do you like to watch comedy central ?
21332,"nah , they cancel way too many shows ."
21333,it's crazy that thry've canceled kver 100 shows in the last 30 years .
21334,"that is hilarious , but i can belive it . i think some shows are no good oj that cnanelt o b ehonest ."
21335,yeah tyhey cdo . did you know that ' the green lantern ' was originally going to be a comedy starring jack black ?
21336,"no , i didn't know that . did you see it ?"
21337,"i have sen it , it was ok with rfyan reynolds . i don't think it woud; ahve been 6oo good with jsck black ."
21338,"yeah , i can believe that he hasn't made a good movie n a long time . well , nice chatting !"

21347,you are njot missing out . i had to shovsl or snowblow for 2 hours today . we got 7 inches !
21348,i guess one gopd thing about the snow is no snakes . i don't know which one i'd hqte the worst .
21349,sjakes . the qanswer to what do i hate more is always snakes . . . i can't edven wwatch them on tv .
21350,"i'm a wuss whne it colmes to the cold , i can alays kikl snakes , but you can't kill the cold . the fear of snakes is hardwired in our brains , o it's natura to be fraid of them ."
21351,"i gues it's regional becuase i can always put on more layers . i can't run away from snakes fast enough ! what do you do for a living , besides dance ?"
21352,"i'd like to imagine that i'm a professional dancer , but nobody seens to want to pay me money . in actuality i'm a biomedical equipment technicia nat a children'sw hospital ."
21353,nice . sounds fun . whqat's up with these clying snakes ? are those the most te5ifying ?

21356,"i'm down ! to me it would be a snake , i mean , isn't that what a snake is ? haha . there was a guy that told me that there was something like that in thea rea i lve , but i hav yet to see any ."

21358,"legless 0pigs , legless dragons , can you imagine ? i tnink that could eb a mnew skng . i'l,l have to call up ine of the dan's and see if i canw rite it for them ."

21372,that is crazy to think about . i used to watch it and never understood what it was about
21373,"hah ai knpw , right ? do you ever watch the golden globes ? i'd loe to attend ne someday . there's amazihg fashion there ."
21374,"for sure , that would be awesome , i don't know what i ould wear , what do you think ?"
21375,"hmm , not sure . but just mkae sure that your clothes are tailored . i guess fashionityee look for collar gaps to maqke sure that thy're high quality !"
21376,for sure ! i would war clothes from appel's clofhingl ine from 1986 and really stand out
21377,"yeah ! unfortunarely , there's probablu nothing left from thsm . if you really want to stand out , there's a store 9in alabama that sells clothes from unclaimed baggage at airports . . ."
21378,"for sure , what a great business . pure profit basically !"

21384,"if you are talking about fifa , then yes ;."
21385,"when was the last time the us heldt he world cup ? i wonder , but there ar eno economic gains for countries that host olympics or the world cup ."
21386,i'm not sure . i knlow they got 3rd place in the first fifa 2orld cup in 1930 .
21387,that's neat . teh american woemn's soccer team seems to fare better in modern times . they haven't placed below third since 1991 int h4 world cup .
21388,"what great talent ! did you know that soccer makes more money than football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis and hockey combined ?"
21389,"i didn ot know that ! americans have to get more into it ! i wonder if they wojld be more into i5 if they watched the version where three teams face each other at the same time l probably not , 3ould be very confusing ."
21390,i think you'rer ight . the world cup is the most prestigious association footbal ltouranment int he world .
21391,i6's th eworld's most popular sport too !
21392,"yes , i'fve heard it exceeds the olympi cgames im viewership .,"
21393,and americans are the only ones who call it soccer because it was slang for association football .
21394,"oh , interesting . did you know that the city se tt9o host the 2022 aqatar fifa world cup does not yet exist ?"
21395,that is interesting . you know jon stewart ? he used to be a soccer player in college and represented 6he us at the pan american maccabi gmses in brazil .
21396,that is really cool . a multi galented guy from the sounds of it .
21397,"yeah . mesuit izil is snother talented one and he donated his eur 300 , 000 world cup victory bonus to pay for surgeries for 23 cildren in brazil ."
21398,that is great to hear . did you know there are noe conomic gains for the coutnries that have playedh ost to the olympics or the world cup ?
21399,"ye s, i've heard that . but amybe it helps some places for future tourism ?"
21400,i woudl think so . especially since soccer makes nore money than all other sports combined .
21401,wellm aybe florida born shaq moore willh elp more zmericans tob e interesed in soccer . he plays in la liga .
21402,sound slike he is the shaq of soccer !
21403,exactly q1 he was playing for smallr spanish teams but now then playhed for la ligya . he was invited to a u . s . national team because of htat .
21404,do you enjoy sports ?
21405,sure . lately i've been into association footbal and wrestlign . how about you ?
21406,"i also like soccer . i was surprised tha ton a gloval scale , it is the wolrd's most popular sport"
21407,"yeah , isn't that wild ' in the usa , nfl seems to overshadow soccer , but the biggest difference i se is that nfl s a lot of waiting around , while soccer is a l0t of running around ."
21408,"well the average nf lgame ahs onl;y 11 minutes of gameplay , while in soccer , they run an avrage 7 miles prr game ."
21409,nice ! all the actions help sme to burn calories just watching ! hzve you seen the version of the game where 3 tams play at the same time
21410,"i heard about it and i think it must be chaotic , but in a good way . i wold lov eto see it"
21411,"me too ! i wish soccer was more popular in teh states . there are a few wellknown people that are into the gme though . did ou know the comedian , jon stewart , was a soccer player that competed lon the world lvel ?"
21412,i didn't . i mean soccer is both popular an dhas influence since it makes more money than most other popular sports combined
21413,"that must be at the 3orld level , like team competing toward the world cup l right ?"
21414,"probably . one german ;layer got 300k euros for a world cup victory bonus , but instead he do9nated it to pay for the surgeries of 23 hildren in brazil"
21415,that's awesome ! woudn't it nd great if one of those ids grew up to be a wold cup athlete ? i wisb the world cxup fina.s were held annually ins5ead o every four years .
21416,well the next world cup is sett o be hosted by qatar in 2022
21417,i hear dabout that . aren't they building a new city for that event ?
21418,"yes tnhe city doesn't yet exist . there are no net economic gains for hosting countries , but i wond4er if they benefit from prestige or tourism tyo warrant thek to buidl and entirely new city ."
21419,"yeah , and what will happe nto the city after the masses depart ?d o you think the usa has a chance to win ? the us got third place inb the first fifa cup ."
21420,"while soccer isn;t us's most popular sport , they have a good chance given their stro0ng track record of never being below 3rd place since 1991"
21421,"you know , back in the 05s , the hungarian team won all nut 1 game over a six year period . six year s! that's insane !"
21422,they must have been having an amazing year . i wonder how they did at th elast world cup .
21423,"good question . hey , you ever attended ar eal wrestlign match ? i wrestled in hs , and i can remember the first time a fellow classmate asked , ' where are the ropes ? ;'"
21424,"i have not , but i have sren a lot of wrestling moves in mixed maritala rts in a cage"
21425,"yeah , that's brutal stuff . hard for a person to survivef or long in that sport . you know abe lincoln was a wrestler ? quite good to ! he oly lot one atch ij a career that lasted over 300 matches !"
21426,i didn't know that . i do know that wrestling hasa a long and distinguished history with even platol eadinf a professional wrestling career before he ecame famous a philosopher
21427,"that's a far cry from today's professional wrestlers , like the macho man , who wears vizarre outfits ."
21428,"in any case , thank 6oi for the enlightening chat about wrestling . have a nice day ."
21429,"hi , how are you doing over there ? you good ?"
21430,i'm pretty good . do y0ou watch soccer ?
21431,"i try to wa6ch the world cup . other than that , not much . how avout you ?"
21432,"not r3aply , but i uzed to play soccer games on the playstation ."
21433,really . were they any good ? did it feel like soccer ?
21434,"it was pretty goo d, but i was never all that good at it . new zealand was th eonly defeated teamj at the 2010 world cup ."
21435,new zealand ? i thought they only did rugby . the wf seems to be a git of scam thougg . hterea re no net economic gains forcf ountries that have played host to the w0rl dcup
21436,yeah me too . bt wjapans bidding for the fifa world up in 2022 .

21482,haha yea my hairlien is starting to recede myself .
21483,di dyou know fhat the pictures we alays see of pilgrims is acftually kind nonrepresentative of their style ? they often wore a lot of color
21484,"oh wow i didn'r ,now that . i saw thar ryazn stkles dropped ouft of high school to pursue a career in comdedy ."
21485,"and im happy he did ! sorta . i mean its importan tto finish your education but if he didtn drop out , we would have never haves een him kn whose line"
21486,i agree . 3rd rock from the sun won the golden globe for best comedy series back in 1i97 .
21487,and it beat s4infeld ! which i like a lot more . d you like 3rd rock ?
21488,"i never really watched 3rd rock , but i really liked seinfeld ."
21489,"same , i even like friends a lot more than 3rd rock ! im surprised"
21490,did you know rip curl makes clothes in north k9rea but label says made in china ?
21491,i wonde rwhy . do you tyink its some sot of legal issue ?
21492,not too sure on that . it was great talking to you !
21493,"cosmetics obviouely can be used to nehance o ralter appearance , but the use to change one's fragrance is a lttle more subtle category of cosmetics ."
21494,that's tre . people often think of cosmetics as being associated with appearance bu tfew thinkd ir3ctly of improving your own sent .
21495,"i tcan also eb natural products . for instance , coconut oil is a great moisturiaer and it smells nice also ."
21496,"that is true , thou you need to be careful wit hit . di dyou hear how a mistake with theat4r makeup made michael chiklis bald when he was only 20 ? that wtuff can be danterous ."
21497,yes .m y ad read a story from a newspaper once about the autopsy of a man who died from hair dye being absorbed into his skin . even the aluminum in most deodorants has some dagner .
21498,"yeah that sounds like a nightmare . there's also plenty of stuff people use every day that they don' even thimnk of as cosmetics like shampoo and hair gel , but that's what they are . interesting how we think of different products ."
21499,"true . i was in the grocery store yesterday morning and ran into azice cooper , he livesh ere in phoneix , . he had on makeup , his signature eye shadow and mascara even a 9 am ."
21500,"really ? interesting that you run intlo a celebrity in a grocery stor ebut hey they gotta eat too , right ? i hear celebrities rely a lot o ncosmetics , i heard keanu reeves gave most of his salary money fromt he matrixt o the people who did his make up ."
21501,"that movie relied on a lot of makeup and special effects . that was generous of him . i guess one would consider those costumes as a type of clothing . you know , every human society wears clothing of some kind ."
21502,"yeah , kinda strange that even societies that developed in very warm climates still wear clothes . did y9u know that apple had a clothing line once ?t hey shoul dry that again , i bet apple's fans would rush to store sto buy apple shirts , haha ."
21503,"apple used to be nihe brand so he clothing probbaly was a great promotional tool . in the early days apple users were sortr of snobb8sh about it . now branding on the outside of clothing is commonplace . of course , some clothing is gender specific but thosel ines get blurry nowadays ."
21504,"yeah that's tru4 they make clopthing out of all kinds of hings like textiles , thin sheets of mater9als , and animal skin , though that last one has fallen i npopularity in recent years ."
21505,"tuat os sur etrue . however , no one complains about leather suoes or bels . eally stylish people can tell if your coothes look tailored by looking for collar gaps ."
21506,"yeah , thqt is strange that those haven't been complained about yet . sometyhing for the next generation , perhaps . all the tricks to make cheaper clothing look more sttylish will generally only fool people who don't care about looking stylish . pretty ironic ."
21507,god point . wearing clothing is mostly restricted to humans . the only caswes that i can think of that are not is when som3a nimal is dressed by a human like some people do for their dogs . it is odd that no other animal dresses itself .
21508,"yeah , you'd think othe ranimals would try clothing , especially those native to colder climates . but at least animals eon't have to worrya bout the various social rules for what to wear anhd when . those can get very complex ."
21509,yes and one van embarrass him or herself if one violates those rules . i wish i gad dressed by child as a pilgrim wearing a red and black checked flannel shirt and told hi to tell the audience at the play that thi9s is how we dress on weekdays .
21510,"yeah , miss one or two obscure norme about clothung and you're comedy film material ! you know , comedies have been made since thr silen tfilm era , pretty impressive . i guess y9u don't need sound to be funny ."
21511,yes . but they were heavy intp salpstikmc which styops being funny when the audience matures .
21512,"yeah , when moviez were enw slapstick was enough to entertain everybody . but as time went on people hneeded more and more to get a laugh . that's why i wou.ldn't drop out of school for a job o ncomedy , no matter ho wwell it worked out for ryan stiles ."
21513,ha ha . one's odds of financial success doing that are pretty low . nice chatting !
21514,do you like colorful clothing ?
21515,"yes i do . miguel cabarlelo who makeds bulletproof clothing , has his employees wear them and get shot to test the clolthing"
21516,wow that is scary . pilgrims wear blacxk clothing omly on special occasions
21517,nice . greeks made asbestosc lothing and it was worth as lot
21518,wow . do you know how fashnion people can tell if you eed your clotyhes tailored
21519,"hmm i have no idea , they tak emeasurements"
21520,nope they actually look for collar gaps in your clofthes
21521,nice . a guy once wore 70 pieces of clothing so he was not charged the fe at the airport
21522,haha that is funny . did you know aqple had a clothing line back in 1986
21523,wow cool . do you know what the flh on the pants is ?
21524,"hmm i am no sure , tghe zipper ? a guy once ued a company because they lost his pants"
21525,it is actual;ly the cloth flap over it . how much did he sues for ?
21526,he sued them for 67 million
21527,wow crazy . women were allowed to wear pants in senate only after 1993
21528,wow that is late in collinsvile saggy pants are prohibited
21529,"i like htat rule l in paris there was a 200 year ban on women wearign pants , un6til 2013"
21530,wow that is late . do you like birds ?
21531,i do . do you know why they fly in a v formation ?
21532,"hmm i amn ot sure , why is that actually ?"
21533,because it reduhces drag by 65 percnt and increases ramge by 71 percent
21534,yeah . have you heard of the dodo bird ?
21535,the movie black panther is rated as a good movie for childrne . thats ijteresting !
21536,"my kidsa re pretty little , so i wouldn't let them watch it , but maybe1 012 year olds would be okay . i love the girl power portrayed ih blakc panther !"
21537,i agree . 1012 would be more appropriatw . there are a few ' s ' words nothing goo extreme ! !
21538,"it seekms like movies can eb pretty racy these days , it's hard to find something that the whole famiy can enjoy . i havfen't aeen early man , but jy sisterinlaw said it was goo dfor all her kid sto see"
21539,hmmm . i haven't seen early man . . . i'll have to check it out ! ! ! the thing i like abou tblack pnathe4r is the emphasis on teamwork . . . and the girl power that yku mntioned is shown with the acknowledgement of femal athoetes ! ! !
21540,"yes ! it's pretty unwxplored in the supehrero universes , it's refreshing to see women with such important roles"
21541,absolutely ! ! early man seems like i twould be itneresting . . . its a fun look at prehistoric times ! ! children always like hat type ofe ntertainment ! !
21542,"i'm not a huge fan of stopmotion , but early man was created by hte smae guy who made wallace and gromit , so at least he knowe what hye's good at"
21543,i think what made black panther interesting is that it focused on the first superheros of color ! ! ! sojmething different ! !
21544,"totally ! i think the cast was fantastic , especially michzal b . jordan"
21545,"yesss ! ! lupit anyong'o ,a ngela bassett , forest whitaker ,d anai gurira and daniel kaluuya lal added special touches gto the movie . . . . helping to bring the story alive ! !"
21546,"i read that chadwick boseman needed money to study at a summer theater pr5ogram at oford but didn't have the money , but then an private benefacto rpaid for him to go . the private benefactor was denzel washington !"
21547,wow ! ! ! that's pretty impressive ! ! i am s big fan of dnezel washington . . . i had no ixea that he acted as a private benefactor and paid for someone els eto study ! ! that's poretty amazing !
21548,"i know ! i love when prople with talent , and money , can help and support others"
21549,absolutely ! ! ! i think that the black panther movie is soerhing that families will talk about together after watching hte movi e. . . race . . . vender . . . . tewm wokr . . . all these are portrayed in thse movie ! ! ! all positive content ! !
21550,"my only beef with black panther is that it's long , like over two hours ! i feel ;ike superhero movies are getting super long , i have a hard time following along sometimes"
21551,lol . . . it wa spretty long . . . but exciting nonetheless . the richest superhero is black panther . . . . h e's worth over 500 billion ! ! bruce wayen was only worth 80 billion ! ! ! what a difference ! !
21552,"i feel like the money wws talked about a lot in teh iron man mogies , but i didn't hear it so much in black panther"
21553,i was su7rprised to find out that blck panther had nothing to do with the black panther wctivist ! ! ! i think a lot of people thought so ! !
21554,"yeah , it can be hard to differentiate , butt hey are so different"
21555,yes ! ! ! gthere are over 300 known superheros in te u . s . and black panther has taken the lead spot ! ! excellent movie and great for the whole famjly ! ! it has been a pelasure taoking to ytou . have a great day !
21556,"thanks , you too !"
21557,how are you ? are you interested in fashion at all ? bottega veneta makes really nice leather handbags
21558,"i like to look at some of it , bu tsomething like new yolrk fashion week would be beyond me ."
21559,"yea , i haven't heard much wbout bottega veneta but they don't like puttng company logos or initials on thei rproducts whkch is kknd of refreshing"
21560,"ye s, i do liek that . although then what is the point of getfing designsr stuff . apparently tom for'ds new collection was tawdry and vulgar . oh dear ."
21561,if tom ford's items are considered tawdry and vulgar i might have to chec kthem out lol
21562,"hah . and did you know that apple had a clothing ;ine in 19786 . they shouldh ave kept that up , people would totally buy that nowadays"
21563,"no i never knew apple had a cloting line , i figure that would be the antithesis of versace pr gucci or dolce onstead of botega veneta"
21564,i thought it was interesting that pilgri mclothing was full of color and the only wore black for special occasions . i'm used t0 seeing them only in black in illustrations
21565,"yea that is interesting , so is checking collar gaps 5o see if you clothes are tailor3d , i'v enever thouhg6 of that"
21566,yeah i'm no ttha 6picky or observant . i suppose if you're in the undustry though its important
21567,"yea but the ihdustry can be shady , like rip curl making clothing in north korea but puting mad ein china o nthe label"
21568,"sure ,m but there should be mkre stores lijke thd one in alabama that sell stuff from unclaimed baggag e. then maybe people could get their stuff back"
21569,i wonder how they are legally able to do that ? they better not sell any of stuff from the d . c . judge tha tsues a dry cleaning business for 67m illion
21570,"i think they have set mor elimits on the amounts people can sue for ,w hich is a good think . i'm glad things have chamged since roman timds , when wearing pants wa sa sign of barbarism"
21571,i wonder what 5he romans wore while riding horses since pants were invented to help ride horses
21572,"yes , i wonder when pants were actually invented , but it must have been uncomfortabl wearign a skirt and riding a hnorse ."
21573,i wonder if tuey ever made pants wiht dodo birtds beforet jey became exting
21574,"how funny that aladdin's pants were modele dafter mc hammer . i didn't know that , but i can totlaly see it"

21594,birds are amazing . their bones are si hollow
21595,that's probably what allows them to fly so easily because thier entire skeleton weghs ess than their feathers .
21596,"i would love to fly so m7ch , good chatting with you !"

21605,"that is amazing , some birds can alsi mimic the sound of chainsaws , cameras and car alarms soa mazing species"
21606,that would be kind of creepy to hear . in most birds their bones are so hollow that thei rentire skeleton weighs less tahn their feathers .
21607,"that makes sense , birds need to be ligth in order to fly , heavy bones can really be a problem"

21675,amkes sense . sk trousers and pant sare the same in british and amerikcan english but in the uk pants usually means underwear ajd not trousers or pants . ? ?
21676,"good question . 8i do know that tailored shorts may be called ' short trousers ' , especially in the uk ."
21677,so many ionconsistenci4s it seems but i guess as long as they know what it means . i want indestructible pants lik ethe hulk .
21678,i use to wear aladdin's pants after mc hammer .
21679,nice ! it was illegal for women to wear pants in paris until 2013 . say what ? so unfair . it was like thazt for 200 years .
21680,"i could not live there a tal. . all i wear is pantsf or work . listen to thjis , a d . c . judge sued a samll dry cleaning business for over 67 million for the loss of a pir of pants ."
21681,"yesah me either . htat is crazy . mus thave been some pair of pant , maybe hulk's , lol ."

21690,"hey , that sounds great ! so what kinds of birds come around ?"
21691,"a lot , the most spectacular are the hummingbirds they are so tiny ."
21692,they are beautiful little things . i like to see htem flit ar4ound . hummingbirds steal spiderwehs to construct and repair their nests . thy are cunning .
21693,"it sound dangerous , they could get caught in it and be eaten by the spider ."
21694,i guess ! lol slme birds fly from alaska to northern mexixo without sleeping when migrating . how do they go witgout sleep ? i 3want to know their secret .
21695,maybe thry are just gliding in the wind and they sleep lightly doing it . like when people sl4eep when they drive . xcept it is not deadly .
21696,"oh , i see . well they don't have phones to distract tehm . that's good . peoplec an be real dodos behind the wheel ."
21697,"dodo vbecame extinct without sleeping at the wheel , funny to think they are eelated to pigeons , which are not extinct ."
21698,"pigeons ar enot terribly smart . but they breed prolifical;y . theyc annot make interestings ounds . there are wild birds in australia that can mimic ths sound of cameras , car alarms , and chainsaws ."

21703,i think it would be tougher to ride a horse in a roman toga . but i never tired it .
21704,8i guess the romans woul fhave shunned pants event hough it were garder . fashion is more important .
21705,"fashion is important , that's why aladin's pahts are like those of mc hammer's , and not disco pants ."
21706,"i thought mc hamemr modeled his pants on aladdin's , actually ! lol . oh well . collinsville , il has a law that prohibits ' sagy pants . ' i understand ."
21707,"maybe it is a agricultural town , they would a a xafety issue on s farm , asnd a snaitagion issue in a slaughter hous e."

21714,"it must be really hard , i heard that software is rteally sequre , the s is road gested at an ihdoor track ,"

21716,"thzts actually really responsible with thee nvironment , i think elon musk is a realy smart man , hs sacrifices a lot of money for the company"
21717,"yea , musk must be super rich to tak ea 78 million paycut to hi stesla salary"
21718,"he must eb taking a paycut like that one , id idnt knoq toyota owned a par of tesla"
21719,"me neither , i also had no clue tesla help develop the rav 4 ev"
21720,"elon mysk also founded paypal and spacex ,"
21721,"i knew musk fouhnded space x but didn't know he also founded paypal , he must be worth billions for paypal alone"
21722,"yeah nad laso tesla mktors , all 3 of them must bwe worth a lot of money kind of like entflix , a service with 137 million subscriebrs"
21723,"it's crazy how big netflix has grown since being founded in 1997 , now it is available worldwide"
21724,"it is crazy , i bet reed hashtings and marc randolph didnt had such a big proyect in mind , its now a ginat of the industry"

21730,"they did ? i bwt they regret that decision , anyways its been great chstting with yu , hope we can do this again"
21731,"you too , uave a great day"
21732,"hi , how o you like tesla ?"
21733,"i've never driven or ridden in one , but i have to admit that they're pretty sleek cars"
21734,"neither have i , and you know , i did not knowt hey were related to toyota ,w ho owns 10 percent of tesla"
21735,"tesla helped develo the 2nd generation rav4ev , whuch i have ricden in before . i'm more familiar with toyota fars"
21736,i found really cool they could test one of the model sindoors because does not produce any emissions !
21737,ns'tt hat the model s ? that would also mean htat it can be parked inside a closed garage
21738,"and it wou;d not do any harm ! i think the founder , elon musk did a grezt design there !"
21739,"well , he also founded paypal and s0acex , so he definitely knows what he's doing !"
21740,"he has beewn involved with online banking , aerospace manufacturers , ai technologies , neurological technologbie samong other thingsx ! !"
21741,i wonder what made him choose to us elinux in the model s . there must be a good reason for that
21742,"he is not conven5ional , fo5 exampe he toik a large paycut on his tesla salary , out of 78 million he returned everythintg except for 1"
21743,"but i'm sure it was worth it , h2atever ther eason . he seems like the kind of guy who takes big risks for something he thinks will pay off in the future"
21744,he is not tied to the convetnional . i would like to see the vertical tkaeoff e4lectrical pasenger jet h ewants to build
21745,"not just tat , but i wonder wha is longter mplan is when it comes to mars colonization . a heavy lift roclet would be nice , but there's a lot more that would need to eb invented for tha ttype of colonization"
21746,it looiks like he is seriously thinking about that . i would watn to stay oj earth definetely
21747,"oh , definitley ! i don't know what yis wife looks like , but she was in the movie inception"
21748,"i remember her and the movie as well , it is amazing . it loosk like he acted too in ' thank you for smoking ' , i have not seen that on3"
21749,"i've never heard of that one , but i'm surprised that someone who is that much into mot having emissions would be in something with tha ttitel"
21750,"he even have time for boring stuff , he founded teh boring company !"
21751,roe she even sleep ? he ahsw all the energy to pursue all 6hese different ideas
21752,it was jice talking to you ! good bye

21754,"i' dlovge to go to peru . not to see the fifa world cup , but to see the land . america always does good in the world cu0 , i think ."
21755,"i know france typically does wel in te world cup , i think they won the most recent one"
21756,i hear they've held the fifa world cup in russia . i wonder if it was snowing when they were playing . seems chess might br a more reasonaboe game . . . or hockery !
21757,"seems that way , i wonder how taipa would play in russia after playing in orlando city"
21758,you mean at the football game he mightf eel the effects of changing climate and net lag and azllt hat ?
21759,"yea , i wonder how all the teams from places lik ecosta rica and the middle easyt will fare"
21760,i've heatrd elevation really can make a difference in how sports players get on . i wonder if the association for football will ever get involved to be sur eplayers can be ok ? maybe they do already ?
21761,i don't know but they should . i heard the city ib quatar hoting the 2022 world cup doesn't even exist yrt

21764,that's so many years ! i jus tlike how they say gooooooooooooal !
21765,"yea but they make a lot of money , more than football , basketball , golf . and tennis combined"
21766,"i like to play chess mo5e htna football , but mostly because i don'6 want a head injury . i'm crazy enough without that , too !"
21767,"i haven't played chess much , apparentlu there are more moces than atoms in the universe , sounds untrue to me"
21768,"i've tried to be good at chess for years , but didn't start playing ntil i was a treenager . i'd try to come up with strategy moves but i always end up being th eone who is checkmates ."
21769,"i was never good at chess , apparetnly there's a negative correlation between iq and the highest skilled players"
21770,i neer knew until recently that chess was invented in india . i'd like to bo to idnia and play chess . . . but maybe a fe whundreds or event housands of years ago back in ime .
21771,"well at least before the 7th century , that's a lot og games of chess played"
21772,"well , it'as not about chess being new hen i play it but more about having much lsess pollution than there is now . stories i've heard make india seem like it was a paradis years ago ."
21773,"i have to go , it was nice tlakingw ith you"
21774,"hi , o you watc hthe worl cup ?"
21775,"yes . i tis festival , we enjoy for a month . all team are eager to lift the trophy they are working very hard ."
21776,yeah . i thonk peru is 5he temat o watch .
21777,wining or loosing are the part of the game . nice to watch it .
21778,yeah but the hungary national team inly had one defeat between 1950 and 1956 . so winning was a part . but l0sing ? not so much .
21779,"21 world cup tournamenth as been won by 8 teams , it is most prestigeous tournament of the world ."
21780,wha tabout chess tournaments ?
21781,"chess is a two player strategy board game played o nchessboard , chess id believed to be originated in incia ."
21782,we need a chaturanga championhsip tournament .
21783,"yes , some of the easfern strategy games xiangqi , janggi and shogi . chess reached the european countries in 9th century ."
21784,but socce damkes more htan all hte major us sports combined . how much cash doea chess bring in ?
21785,in 20th cenjtury computers have bene programmed to play chess with increasing success . which laso make the game very popular all over the world .
21786,but are there economic gain sfor couintries that hosrt chess tournaments ? there aren't for the world cup .
21787,hte best palyer can awarded specific lifetime title by the world chess organization . grand master titel is highest .
21788,"if chess was really invented by aliens , then a better title is i norder ."
21789,it is vcery interesting .
21790,sure is . but not as intresting as 3 team socce r.
21791,"yes , chess is indoor game but soccer is outdoor both are tlotally diff4etn ."
21792,"yeah , i doubt jon stewart can play chess ."
21793,strong mental health isn eede dfor any games for having tactics and handle the pressure of the game .
21794,ig's also needed in order to have a good covnersation . have a great day !
21795,i know a lot more about chess than soccer . what ar4 peru's chances for a wrld cup ?
21796,"much better now that guerrero is back . . . so they say . i am with you , ches sis closer to my heart . althouhg rh eworld cup is popular ."
21797,apparently the connection is elo ratings . the player ranking system for chess has been applied to worl dcup games .
21798,nice . too bad th efif aplayers can't ride on those little horses they use in ches .
21799,that woudl look a lo tlike polo . i would like some one to shout 'gooooolll ! ' when i make a good move in cehss .
21800,muy bien ! fantastico ! give taht person a boy scout merit badge in chess !
21801,these littleb its of knoweldge are fun . i wonbdesr if more people play chess or soccer . less runnhing in chess i think .
21802,"i like the idea that pawns each usedt o have their own names , based on commoner occupations . mcdonald's drive throuhg attenrdajnt takes kings bishop . nice ."
21803,i have never heard that . is that somehing like rock paper lizard spock ? thrre are more possible move in ag ame of chess than atoms in the known universe .
21804,"and with a style where trhee llayrs can play simultaneously , i can be baten with any of those oves twie at the same time !"
21805,car wash squeegee mant akes takes queens rook . the presidetn of the world chess federation believes hcess was invetne dby aliens . . . .
21806,stable boy wrestles rook away from squeegee man . i wonder if chaturanga was this much fun ?
21807,i bet it was . people in india like a good game . i wonder if the pieces were kind of like gods or just animals . eelphant scooper moves forward two spaces .;
21808,i wonder how different shogi is from chess ? bishop slides theough remain so f3aht the elephant scooper missed .
21809,i have no idda about shogi . chess rdwached e8rope by the 9t century . school lunch lady advances one space .
21810,pieces assumed their current powers in spain in the late 15th century . proctologist's assistnt move in behind queens janitor .
21811,lol . the rules were standardized in ghe 19th century . chernjobyl janitor moves to the eighth rank o the board and becomes a queen .
21812,"nice . not bad for a bunch of rocks on a 8x8 board ! qtip quality control assistan6 has the kings ear , influences next move ."
21813,"there is a negative correlation betwee niq and hcess skill ins trong players . t weather man opens window and states t5he obvious , moves forward one space ."
21814,"the superbowl is smaller thant he third biggest fifa event , but still much bigger than a pawn ."
21815,"soccer makes more money that football , basketball , baseball combijned . mongo , pawn ing ame of life tired of drinking . does nothing"
21816,there was only one 1g roup in world cup history that ended in a 4way tie . i lay dow my king and genuflect at your feet .
21817,do you follow fif asoccer at all ?
21818,i do ! i wzss o happy to see france win the worl dcup again . long wait fof the next one now .
21819,i thin kthe women play this year ? right ?
21820,oh yea that's rihgt . should tide me over . the bids for the 2022 world cup were pretty crqzy . did yo see what countrie swere offering ?
21821,"yeah , and they chose qatar ."
21822,it;s a good choice but japan would have been cool . they were goig to project 3d holog5ams oft he games ! beats 4k for sure .
21823,"that is crazy , that would definitelyg et ,m vote"
21824,hopefully it wil lbe cool enough in qatar . it gets very hot there .
21825,"well , seeing as they havent eveb built rhe city that will hist the dinal , they ight be building sme super cool indoor stadiums or something ."
21826,"yes with aca nd al l, however with things like htis yhey never tend to go as planned . they still have time but for them at least i imagine time will fly by fast ."
21827,it always does . it is a shame no place ever really profits off nosting in the long run
21828,they can't with tday's securityc ozsts . really it should just be played at the same place every time or at least every other time . it's crazy to think that the superbowl is smallert hen soccers 3rd largest event .
21829,"the supe rbowl doesnt involve a lot of people , so many people follow soccer in tyhe world"
21830,"yeah aemrican football just doesn't have worldwide appeal . the people who do casually watch ,w ztch for the commercials . socce ris played in over 200 countries so everyone grows up with it ."
21831,"that is tru e, it does even make more money taht many other sports combinesd ."
21832,it probably helps you don't need much equipment to play either . you do need to be in shape thohgh . soccer players run an aveage of 7 miles per game !
21833,thats why i always playred keeper . fa5 less running !
21834,"yes ! do you play chess as well ? i dind it very challenging when you are matched up with someone who is equally skil,ed ."
21835,"i cn pla , but i am not very good . i cant see many moves ahead like some people can ."
21836,maybe you should try 3 person chess . there is a speial board that allows 3 peopel to play all at once .
21837,i dont know about that . . . sounds like aliens might have invented that . . .
21838,lol . i'm not sure about the 3 person version but current chess boards were invented in spain in the 15th century but the gameg oes all the way back to before the 7th cnetury !
21839,adcording to thde president of the world chess tederation it was invented by aliens .
21840,are you sure htat wasn't a joke ? i think i'll go look into that . it was nice chatting with you .
21841,you never know . have a geat night !
21842,what en6ertainmentd o you enjoy ?
21843,"i liked horror movies , like the exorcist ."
21844,spo is horror your favorite genre ?
21845,"i don't think so . i think drama may be my favorite genre , bt i do love some horror movies . i mentioned thee xorcist because it is legitimately one of my favorites . i recently learned that during hte filming of the movie , no one thought it was a horror film . that's funny ."
21846,for me horror is usualy ah it or miss . i personally enjoy drams since it brings depth t0o a story either througjh tragedy or comedy
21847,"yes , a lot of horror doesn't interest me . i lke some old slasjher movies from the 80s tough . what' syojr favoriye dramatic movie ?"
21848,i th8nk horror films are very subjective . you can even consider bambi to be one
21849,"the destruftio nof the environment , the death of close loved ones . . . pretty horrifjc , but seems more like a drama to me ! poor bambi . tell me why you think bambi could eb a hoeror movie ! interested to hear yo7ur thoughts on that one ."
21850,"i mea nfir a little kid , seeing death is qyite tramatic"
21851,"yes , learning about death as a little kid can be terrifying , and a movie like that might stick witu you for a long time . learning about death is part of learning about the universe though , and it hink it's pretty important ."
21852,"true , but how much will we ever really know about the universe ?"
21853,good question . . . i can't claim to know much about it o6her htan that it's a cerazy mystery . i think it's trippy thinking about the idea tat our universe could exist insid eof a black hole . it's like thatm ovie inception or something .
21854,it is also hard to comprhend fhere is a region of space pullign galaxies outside the observable univeree
21855,"yea that stuff boows my mind . i can't really comprehend it . also interesting that black holes apparently wmit super low sound waves that humans ca ndetect , nmot qith their sars , but still , ."
21856,imagine if everything is one big superhologram ?
21857,right ? i remember readung rcently that elon musk from tesla thinkst hat it's possible we live in one giant simulation . reminds em of the amtris . it's not too outrageous a thought when you learn how crzy th euniverse is .
21858,i mean there is even a theory that is only 1 electron in the universe . i can't even udnerstand what that means
21859,"same here . i jkind ofd think of that cgi animatioh at the end of men ij black where the camera zooms out frome arth adn our universe to the point whedre it all become sa marble that is being played with by so,e glaactic mpnster . it's wctually kind of a comforting thought that the universe is so strange . . . it makes little things that happen in my life seem less weird ."
21860,"i found it interesting how in the men in black , the galaxy was a marble"
21861,i love that movie . the sequels weren't so great in my opinion though . have you seen them ?
21862,"yes i found them to eb decent . in any case , thanks for hvcatting ."
21863,do you know if hasbro was hurt by toys r us ?
21864,"it definetly was , toys r us was one of the biggest toy stores in the us and it closed its doors so that definetey affected the sales of many companies"
21865,what other com0anies could fill in hte void left by toys r us ?
21866,"companies such as amazon , wallamart and even target are good options , what are your thoughts on these companies ?"
21867,it is hard o say . only about a third of thje lost volume has been made up .
21868,"i guess theres mre to it than just a great intermidiat e, im sad about the workforce shortage the company has to make ."
21869,true . hasbro is expected to lost up to 60 million in severance .
21870,"thats a lot of ,oney , so cjhanging the subject a bit did you appen to see the movie frozen ?"
21871,i thpught it wasa a good adaptation of the snow quen fairyt ale .
21872,"it was pretty good , my daughter loved the movie , star wars is also another good franchise , both own by dksney now"
21873,true . did you know arcia lucas is responsible for many iconic star wars moments .
21874,"behind every great man there is a great woman , i guess this phrasd applies to george lucas and i didnt know that but it doesnt surprise me eithedr ."
21875,"then again , james early jones is great , but he only made 7500 for his iconic roke in star wars ."
21876,"only 700 soemone defintely got ripped kff , kind of like fox with george lucad , although it was all because the lack of faith oft he network in the franchise"
21877,"you know who didn't get ripped off ? amazon's first customer , who spent 27 . 59 and had a builsing named after bim !"
21878,tnat sure is a bartgain 27 . 95 or having a building nameda fter you an dplus you also get merchandize from the company
21879,rrue . they are tough negotatiors . they even got a cobtrzct cfor sundcay deliveries with the usps !
21880,"wow , i bet amazon is one of thef ew companies t0 qahve a contract like that one , you know they have a patent on the 1click buying option"
21881,i heard that fact . amazing what can be accomplished in less than 25 years !
21882,"i know right , in jjst 25 years amazon has poaced itse fon the top of the world even higher than companies such as 5arget and walmart"
21883,true ! thanks for the chat . i think i will go rezd something on my kindle !
21884,do you like toys r us ?
21885,"i used to , a lot . do you like them ?"
21886,wel lhasbro is catchign it . they dropped 7 percent ih sales .
21887,"wow , i also read they're down 24 percent interantionally ."
21888,"yeah make way fir bezos he's taking over the world , lol ."

21929,"i know , u'ms till upset about that one . hasbro is bkaming their 7 percent holiday drop on toys r us closing"
21930,"i guess tha tit is possible . i've heard that hasbro is going to build a warehouse in the ,idwest to improve their shipping times . mayb ethat will help ."
21931,yea their analyst sat da davidson think that sould be their best mov e. i think it coudl help with shipping costst o retailers
21932,maybe that will improve teir bottom line . did you know taht toys r us owed hasbro around 59 million last september ?
21933,thats a ton of money and probablt not the only people they owed money to sadly . the hasbro brand covered some of the biggest licensed brands so its nots urprising
21934,"you know , i think that if toyzs r us hzd lowered it's prices some they might stil,l be in business . they were just too high priced compared to walmaft and amazon ."
21935,both oo high priced and far too less convenien tthan shopping from hoem on amazon
21936,i agree with that . amazon is the lrgest internet retailer i nthe world .
21937,"with one of them ost unique founders n the 2orld , jeff bezos ."
21938,"he i s. dif you know eh built a clock in6o a mojuntain that should last5 for 10 , 000 years ? the question there is , why ?"
21939,yup naha that's what i was referring ro wehn i wa ssaying he was unique . is he htat bored ? that's crazy . amazon has explioded in growth since itw as fo7nded i n1994
21940,"it really has . i have to admit , whenever i want to buy something aamzon is the first place i think of ."
21941,i thnk that's the case for almost eve4ryone these days . they hafe so muvh stuvf that warehouse wokers tend to walk 715 miles every single shift
21942,"well , i'ts good exercise and good pay from what i hear . you know you are an important business though when the post office agrees to deliver our stuff on sundays !"
21943,they do that ? i thought the post offices were always closed on sundays ?
21944,"i did too , but i guess jot fora mazo9n ."
21945,thats crazy . almost as crazy as he first sale on amjazon being for a building for 27 . 95 . can you imagine being the guy who did that ?
21946,that guy had to be either very trusting or very crazy lol ! i wonder what building it was !
21947,me too ! all i know is that i bet he's hapy he made that risk way bakc then
21948,"hello , how are you ?"

21950,"pretty goo d, do you like music ?"
21951,"absolutely , wo doesn't ?"
21952,"yeah , some more than others . ed sheeran has a great vocal range !"
21953,"i really enjoy listening to ed sheeran , i've listened to every album ."
21954,"really that's inerestint . yes , i do too !h e couch surfed for 2 1 or 2 years between gigs ."
21955,"yeah , o love th3e fact he is influenced by eminem , which is a true inspiration ."
21956,"yes , interesting lady taga has four names ."
21957,wow really ?
21958,"three girl names , stefani joanne angelina ."
21959,"that is really pretty . i reemmber listening to her before she ewas famous . loady gaga is soc lose with elton john , he made her the god mothyer toh is son ."
21960,"reakly , that's nice . pink floyd still got one of the best selling albums of 2014 ."
21961,"that js amazing , they ar esuch a old gbroup , i'm surprised so many people still listen to tnem . speaking of older groups , lady gaga's favorife band is irn maiden ."
21962,"i know , and that surprises me about lady gaga ! did you see the grammys this year ?"
21963,i watchef a little bit olf it .
21964,"i misse dit , i did see som4 parts the next day . like tow atched the before show interviews ."
21965,i believe there was a controversy about womne not winning some cvategories .
21966,"ye s, i see that . ny times stated only 9 percent of nominees have been women ."
21967,it's lind of ridiculous because the women this year have released better music than most men . at least in my opinion .
21968,"i now , crazy . justin biebers song ' love yourslf ' was writtenh by ed sheeran ."
21969,"ir emember edc sheeran talking about this , i think it's cool ."
21970,"omg , tqo twins at 10p years old released a rsp album in ajpan . lol"
21971,"oh my goodness , that iz crazy ! lol anyway , it was nice talking to you , i've gott o get some sleep . hav a goodnigt !"
21972,you too !
21973,"thanks , bye !"
21974,"hi , do you like ladyg aga ?"
21975,yes ! i love lady gaga .
21976,did you know thath er real nam eis stefani joanne angelina germanotta ?
21977,"i think i khew her name i sstefani . i had no idea that whe has two middle anmes . joanne , ib elieve , was the name of her granmother ."
21978,"that's cool . i heard she first began performing as a teenager , singign wt open mic nihgts and acting in school plays . what's your favorite gaga song ?"
21979,i did not now she did school plays . i yhink my favorite son gis actually the song named after her grandmother called ' joanne ' . do you have a favorite song by her ? are you a fan ? ?
21980,"i became a pretty big fan in 2008 when her first album , the fam was released and contained poker face .d id yu see th4 new movie she is in with bradley cooper ?"
21981,i cannot believe that album was nearoy ten yearsa go . i hav no seen it . i did see they won a grammy for the song 'shalow' the other night . i think that is the name of the song anyway .
21982,"you're right l, that was tjhe name of the song . the movie is very good too , you should definitely see it . it's funny that lady gaga got her name from a predictive text glitch that changed ' dadio ' o ' ;ady '"
21983,this is what everyone keeps telling me . i nejoy bradleu cooper so i think i woudl like the movie . i ma relaly glad that she went wit h'aldy gagy' and not 'radio gaga' . . . .
21984,"yeah , it definitely wouldn't haveg he sae ring to it . it's in6teresting that she became so popular that the lapd asked for her assistance . they asked her to tweet to he 11 . 4 million follower sabout information tor some upcoming road wor so the word would get out faster ."
21985,i rezad htat ! good thing some celebrity influecje cqn do some good . . . if that is considered good lol i didn't know eklton john hadr any childrne . not surprised that lady gage is the godmkother .
21986,that's cool she's elton's son's godmotehr . . . does lady gaga have any children of her own ? it's funny that she was on mtv's ' boiling points ' before anyone ever knew she was going to be famous
21987,"no , she does not have any of her own children . i wonder if i can find that clip od her on boiling points somewhere . would be interesting t9o see what she looke dlike . she had to have been 18 or 19 at ths time i would guess ?"
21988,probablg so . . . it's inte3restin gtha tmany big artists appeared on television shows before they were famou s. justin timberlake and britney spears wete both on the mickey moise clu7b when they were much younger .
21989,i rememer reading about britney spears and justin timberlake being on the micke6 mouse club when they were childten . ryan gosling was on there as well !
21990,"do you think ed sheeran was on any tv shows before he was fmous ? i didn't realize he had written ' love yourself ' but gave it away to justin bieber , lol ."
21991,if he has been it was definitely in the
21992,it's weird that emiem is one of ed's biggest musical influences . . . ther musical styles couldn't be any more different .
21993,it was definitely in fhe uk . i don't know what happened there . ed sheeran ha shad to have written for many people . i would never have guessed eminem for one of his musical influences . that is strangd !
21994,definintely strange . . . n9ce talking to you !
21995,"hi , how ar eyou ?"
21996,good this moring ! yourself ? did you wtch the grammys ?
21997,i did not . i am not a huge awrds sow perso n. what about you ? did you watch them ?
21998,i did . i was rrally dsappointed that kesha and szqa were snubbed . i thought they would get some kind of nod .
21999,i know kesha but not sza . do you kno2 sza ?
22000,"sza sings r and b . she is pretty good . when the grammy guy was asked why more women weren't bominated , he blamed women , not a gkod move ."
22001,seems like he was shirking responsibiliyty for xexism .
22002,"it sure looks like it l although he did make a good point . if women want to b recognized , theyd o have o step up znd make tehir voices heard ."
22003,"kesha sue dher producer for sexual assault and despite the evidnece , he was let off . seems like she is not getting justice in either arena . . ."
22004,that is so true . i lived her video ti ktok too . sing it almost every day even if it is silly . i thought lady gaga would at least be mentioned for her music in that film she did wiht bradley cooper .
22005,her super bowl leap was crazy . did you sed that last year ?
22006,no ! i'll have to look that up . i guess lorde was pretty ticked offa t the grammy's too . they wouldn't let her sing .
22007,i do think they should add hte most tone deaf spoke nword statement award . so many white males wouldb e nominated !
22008,"they would ! i guss ed sheeran won for tbi syear ! : ,"
22009,i like him . . . don't tell my judgmental friends . . .
22010,": , i do too . he makes loving music . fun stuff . did you see the white roses everyone ore to the grammy's by nay chanc ?"
22011,i did not ; what did theys ignify ?
22012,the time's up initiative . a legal fund set up tor victims of sexual haraszment ! huge support for it .
22013,speaking of white males . . . i found or find that whole movement disappointingly necessary . can't people just act right ?
22014,"tyat would be nice , but men ahve run the indistry for so long , they think it?s their privilege . do you ever listen to lady gaga ?"
22015,i hae in the past . do gou listen to her ?
22016,not too much . i watched herv ideo with bradley ooper last night . she is so much prettier without alp the make up . i 2atched her q ligttle in american horror story . was really over the top .
22017,nice chagting witu you !
22018,do youl ike kehsa ' personally i think shes a great artist with a lot of talent
22019,"ya i do like her , cant' eblieve she was snubebd last year at the grammyz"
22020,"yeah and also ed sheeran had a controversial win , not sure itf he desdrved that ."
22021,"ya i can't say i agree , do you like lady gaga btw ?"
22022,"yeah i do , not only as a singer but shes also a great actress , what about you ?d o you like her ?"
22023,"ya she does a good job ,. i guess she was born back in 1986 which iw one year younger than me haha"
22024,"hses a young artist , she has a lot to give , ,any singles , many mivies to come ."
22025,"y i coul dsee that , it sfunny she got her na,me from a predictive textg litch that changed radio to lady"
22026,it is funny just like how hte lapd asked her to tweet info about an upcoming roadwork in teh town
22027,"ya that was fujnny , also cool is elton john who chosel adg gaga to be bis son's godmother , thats cool"
22028,"thats interesting , did you ever watch the shoe boiling poitn son mtv ?"
22029,"nope never heard of it , whaty is it baout ?"
22030,"its a show that used to rna on mtv uit was like a reality tv kind of show , well lady gaga was o ni9t"
22031,"oh i see , ya i lik her early hits lk poker facea nd just dance i think those werd some og herb est songs"
22032,"those are great songs , i like the as well , lady gaga has a favorite band , not the less than iron maiden ."
22033,"wow hat is crazy the music is com;pletely different , and ya she hass sold over 27 million albums and 150 million singl4s , shes one of the best selling artists in teh history of music"
22034,yeah they have limke compeltely opposite stylesj ust like ed sheeran cite eminem as one of fhis biggest influences .
22035,"h that i sinteresging , he alxso has a better vocal range than freddie mercury which i scrazy"
22036,"thats suprising since freddie mercury had a really great and unique voice , ed shewran is a great artits but mercurh is in another league ."
22037,"ya i agree , nothing ed has made touches freddie's s6uff , although it was nice that ed gave the songl ov yourself to biebef to sing"
22038,"yeah that was a nice thing to do , i guess they must be really good friends , sheeran had a rough road to becomingv thr artist eh is now"
22039,"ya k tsoundz like he did , had to couch surf for 2 years and slseep outside , tgat sounds rough"
22040,yeah it souds that way
22041,do you like pop music ?
22042,"is ok , did you8 know most pop hits use the same 4 chords"
22043,"yes , very interestin g, you can do a lot with 4 chords . did you know that in a 2012 study they foumnd out that pop muzsic has grown louder and more musically homogeneous since the mkd6o0's ? i believe htat accounrs fo rthe 4 hcord harmony ."
22044,"probably , i do like ' we are the champions ' , which is considered the catchiest pop song of all time"
22045,pop music i8s part of our culturea nd other cultures as well . the presidemt of indonesia reelased 3 pop albums while in office .
22046,"funny , must not be too busy being president . ir ead that som3e pop record labels send out rejection eltters that start wity ' dear lowser '"
22047,"ha , no doubt . still pop music is ' po0pular ' . ricky gervais wa sa pop singer in the 80's . and , nodrth korea eve nhas its own kpop girl bnad named the ' moranbong band ' which i sthe most popualr music group in their coutry ."
22048,"wow , how about the beatles , regarded as one of the most influential bands in history"
22049,the beatles were cool . they started beatlemania back in the 60's and they became integral to teh pop music evolution ajd helped turn it into the srt form that it is today .
22050,"nice , they broke in 1970 b4fore any of them were even 30"
22051,"yes , ghey had political imnterestst oo . another interesting fact is taht the beatles's song ' come together ' was written for timothy peary' s1969 cqlifornia governor campaign ."
22052,"interesting , and thw used the word love 613 times in theifr songs !"
22053,"yes , the beatles are kown fort hat although none oft he beatles could actually read music . on top of that , they literally stopped touring bcause back in the day you couldn't hear thej ovr the screaming in the audience ."
22054,"ic an imagine , and no touring needed , aerosmith made more money from gui6ar hero then any album"
22055,"yes , the beatles have a guitar hero gams as well . funny , another strange thing i found out was hat ringo starr wa silliterate for most of his childhood because he missed three years of school becase he had tuberculosis and peritonitis ."
22056,"did not know that , walt disney did double track vocvals 10 years before tye beatles did"
22057,"the bealtes ran the gamet htough . they went from 50's type rock adn roll to pop ballads and then to indian msic and finally to psychedelia and hard rock . and , all the while they incorporated classical elements and unconventional recordinb techniques in innovative ways ."
22058,"qute resourceful , people stop traffic tl recreate beatles image at qbbey road too"
22059,"cool . yes , abbey road was one of hteir best albums . they even hadt he best selling album of the 2000's . apparently par of taht ' beatlemania ' carries on in today's world ."
22060,"definitely , nic echatting"
22061,same here . have a good one .
22062,are you a fan of pop music ?
22063,i do like pop music . also jazz and rock . how about you ?
22064,"i love pop music , especially the late 90s earl 00s ! ith as been around since the 50s"
22065,do you like 80s pop ? it has a distinct sound . i think that it is popular withj the kids now because it is nostalgic .
22066,"i don't know if i ever heard of htat king . i oncr heard music from ricky gervais in the 80s , that was interesting !"
22067,there are many wonderful pop songs from that 5ime . you can find them on youtube . impress your friends wirh your knowledge of ancient pop .
22068,"i will have to look them up . i heard nort hkorea has its own pop style , that would be interesting to listen to !"
22069,i think that nk must have a pretty bad kind of pop . probably syrupy and stuff . i bet the sing about the dead leader .
22070,for sure and then cry about 8t lol ! do you have abyf avorite albumxs ?
22071,no favorite albums . i usually listen to songs on youtube . i do like some jazz albums on there i guess . what about you ?

22074,"right , sad that people baytle those demlns . were you a fan of nwa"
22075,"i was jot a fgan , but they sure could spit mad fire ."
22076,"for sure , they released their album and it becamed platinum w3ithout major air play or tours !"
22077,"they knewt hat yhe streets was hungry for some reaol beats , rela truth . they did no need to market reality to the people ."
22078,"for sure , they coined f the police i think , great song though . almost as good ast he songs made by 2 010 year old twins from japam ."
22079,i wnt to hear what those twins released . it must eb awbout arthritis and stuff .

22097,in a way . genes that are responsible for diseases in us canb e found in them too
22098,oh w0w then it totally makes sense to study them snd invest in that kind of research
22099,yeah exactly . do you use the computer much ?
22100,all the time actually . do you know what captcha is an qcronym for ?
22101,i actually do not kow taht good question . do you know ?

22103,"wow that is very long , i like the acronym much better ."
22104,"so , is there a national pi day , or is juest someonesh ope ?"
22105,that is funny . it must be a mathematicians dream .
22106,"actually i just looked it up , march 14th . it's a dayt o celebrate mathematics , some peple just buy pies though ."
22107,oh i see .n ive . many people think hte world woulsd be a better place if we can appreciate things beyond the scientific fields .
22108,"i used to enjog doing math at school , until it got too theorwtical . tlak of quantu, math just baffles me ."
22109,yeah it is very tough stuff . i liked biology and learning about fish . so amazing tey lackl imbs eith digitw !

22112,"is a seahorse a fish . i sppose it can't be anything else . what about ejllyfish , are they fish ?"
22113,yes i guess it is considered a ish but i am not certain . asf or jellyfish i believe ao . there is even a breed of jellyfish that never dies .m aybe a blessing or maybe a curse .
22114,"how would you know ? you can't ask it , and yu can't watch it all the time , i'd need some kind of proof to believe that ."
22115,yes true . i would like to khow more . they probably get eaten all the time too . by 5he lback swallower fis hperhaps !
22116,ist hat the one that eats ten times its weight ? that's how i feel after thanksgiving meals .
22117,aha yes thats the one . also the zebra fish shares8 4 percent of gnees known to bea ssociated with human disease .
22118,"if they are that closely related maybe the have the capacity to play cgess ? of course , we are back to them not having limbs and fingers , so maybe not ."
22119,ha ha yeah i would like to know more about that . some people actually believe that cehss was created bya liens .
22120,"those people are probably more closely related to the zehra fish tahn just8 4 percent . i underrstand it came from india , mot mars ."
22121,very itneresting . there was knce a chess grancmaster whl beat somebody without even looking at the board . that would be embarrassing .
22122,"i might be the one on the losing side . i used to ahve a computer chess set when i was a id . i fiygured out how to cheat it , so never really learned anything from it , aside fro mhow to cheat ."
22123,oh interesting i would be c8rious to know how people cheat . there are more possible moves in a game of chess than they are atoms in the known universe .

22156,taylor swift removed her music from spotify because ' m7sic shouldnt be free '
22157,"that's interestign . yoiu like her song that's called ' our song ' ? apparently she was the youngest peerson to write and perform a number one coutnry hit , with tha tsong ,"
22158,"no i haventh eard of that one , is it good ?"

22162,"i think that was a great idea i my ipinion , guitar hero wa sa hit because of their contribution , thats a lot of royalties ."
22163,"ye si agree ! i love playing those games when i was in high school , do you ,ike led seppelin by the way ? i love that they didh't name their fourth album just to mess with the rock press , wish they hated"
22164,i never really litened to tbeir music . thats hilarious .
22165,"yous hould check them out , they're actuwlly really good ! just don't buya ny records at walmart by the way , they only sell cleanv ersions of records , that would really annoy me"
22166,"yeah that is annoying , i wanna hear the music the artist released , nkt somee dited verszion ."
22167,hey how3's it going are ylu a star wars fna ? i actuallt really enjoyed the solo star wars film !
22168,il ike some o fthem . did you know that al pacino turned down the role of han solo becaus ehe couldn't understand the script ?
22169,hha that's kind of funny and sad at the same time . i thought ron howard did a good job directing .
22170,i thought he did so too . alden ehrenreich did really good ash a neolo .
22171,yeah he was great . i liked the movie because it took place 10 years after ' a new hope ' so it gave some closure .
22172,yeah and that;s what i fee that series lacks is closure . there's too many open loops in the story line for me .
22173,yeah it always leaves you hanging . but there were some answered questions . i like dhow han solo was a tie ighter pilot before piloting the millennium falcon !
22174,yeah and he also was na imperial lieutenant before his companionship; with chewbacca .
22175,interestinjg . did you know2 george lucas originlaly intended ahn solo to eb a alerge green alien or a black man ?
22176,"that's pretty interesting , h3 also considere hcristopher walker for as hna solo ."
22177,oh he wouldn't be too bad . have you seen deadpool 2 by chance ? i loved ryan reynolds in that !
22178,i loved that movie . did you know tyhat the voideo game cost more to make than the movie ?
22179,wow how is tjat even possible ? it is also the highest grossing film of all time not directed by lucw sor caemron !
22180,"that is wild ! in a 2004 comic book series , deadpool described himself as ' rgan reynolds crossedw ith a sharpei , ' this lead reynolds to believe he was destinedf or the role ."
22181,haha very cool . he really played the role well . he even voi9ced ghe mystery villain !
22182,i heard that the screenwriters released htat . that's pretty neat .
22183,very neat indeed . ib addition to watching movies i also love to travel ? did yo7u knpow 5he japanese highway tolls are exremely expensive ? i would hope they have nice roads .
22184,i've heard that it cost more 5hna 300 to traveo acroass the country . i'd ope they use that money on the roads .
22185,yeah seriously i would hope so . i wonder how much it would cost to ride in those dutch buses that go ip o 160mph ? !
22186,"i'm not sur e, but i feel it would be worth it ? i wish i had one when i was gking on business trips !"
22187,yeah that would have been cool . also i love hawaii and tey had a king who lived to travrl too ! nicec hatting with you !
22188,"helo , what is your favorite jovie ?"
22189,"i really like the movie the godfather . one movie tyat i think is only ok though is deadpoll 2 , did you see that movie"
22190,i have seen dead popol 2 . it is probably my favorite movie of all time ! although i also9 do really like solo a star wars story
22191,"yeah deafpool 2 came out in 0218 , i actually like the first one a lot but didn't really like the second , did you ever play the video game"
22192,"no i have not , although i heard the video game was decent . have you ever plyed the video game ?"
22193,yes i did . the video game is actually really good ! and shocdkingly it cost more than the first deadpool movie to make
22194,"that makes sense , as it fosts the video game developers al o tof money to desin tbe graphics , ajd a lot more to market the fame ."
22195,"do you remekber in deadpool to the mystery vilalin ? apparently ryan reynolds does his voic e, i wonder who the villain is goinb o be in deadpool 3 thoubh"
22196,i wonder too . deadpool is the highest grossing r rated film that was not directer by george lucas or james cameron ! no wonder it was so successful
22197,yes i agree . you saidt hat you like star wars movies right ? dd youk now that han solo used to be a tie fighter pilkot ?
22198,no i did not ! han solo was apparently also an impe4rial lieuenant before meeing up with chewbacca .
22199,"well that is interestign , also george lucas wanted him to eb a large green alien r a black jan originally lol that would have been a very different movie"
22200,i am glasd that they chose for him to be av ery fue5y person . he is one of my favorite star wars hcaracters .
22201,"yep i agree , i love harrison ford , what if they chose christpher walken though ? he was in the running for it"
22202,i wonder what woudl have happened then . maybe we should just be happy tat the thigs are the way they are because the movie turned out to be excellen t.
22203,"yes w etotally should . al ot of things came together well because if you was available , for instance al pacino turned down hna solo's role bevcause he didn't understand the script that would have been totaslly different too"
22204,it wold have been very different . do you hink that we will ever be in a 2orld similar to that of star wars ?
22205,"no i don't think so , that world is too fantastical i think , what do you think ? i would like to travel to outer space thouhg"
22206,speaking of travelling . did you know tht all od japans highways have tolls ? it would cost over 300 to travel across japan !
22207,"yeaht hat sounds expensive , it would eb fun to rde that duth bus 160 miles per hour on those road so lol ."
22208,i wonder if 6here had been mnay accidents 2ith tbose buses because 160 mph does not sound very safe !
22209,"no thats definitely really fast . maybe i'l take a trip to mackinac island though , they don't have buses or any kinds of cars for that matter , only horses"
22210,"i tell you , thix taylor swift is a magnet for controversy ."
22211,"ahh h. . you know , haters gonna hate ! lol . seriously though , yeah , i heard sh'es being sued !"
22212,at least its not kanye west suing . i heard he mocked himself ons nl .
22213,"really ? i dodn't see that ep . course , i haven't watched snl in a good ahile . i did recently do a bunch of ' weekend update ' clips on youtube thougj . norm mcdonald is hiarious !"
22214,"yea h, he made fun of himself fo rinterrupting taylor a an award shot ."
22215,"yeah , i remember that happenong . . . where wa sthat , the mtva warxs ? you know what's weird ? tayloe swift often walks backwards to keep fromg etting her pic taken . i bet the paparazzi lov ethst ."
22216,whoa . sh ecould always fly away from them in her dassault falcon 900 jet .
22217,"i have to admift , as sappy zas it is , i do find ' you bleong with me ' a rather catchy song ."
22218,i would like to hear nwa do that . mayb eput it on a rerelease of straight outta compton
22219,"get the feeling they'd add in a lotm ore swear words . lol . spekaing of which , did yoiu know walmart only sells ' cl4an ' versions of albums ? found that kind of interesting . ."
22220,wow . remind em not to shop at walmarts . . . unless i'm buying a rap album made by 100 year old japanese twins
22221,tbhere's a rap album by 100 year old twins ? what are some of the songs on it ?
22222,lol ! it's almost asg ood as the 8 second white noise taylo4 swift oncr released .
22223,speaking o albums . . . you a bi gled zeppelin fan ?
22224,"yah . i like zep and 70'sr odk in general . 8 hear pink floyd's dark side of teh moon was a bestseller in 2014 , believe it or not . ,"
22225,"i just htink it's funny how lz didn't title any of theit irst four albums . i've heard tehy did that just to nanoy tge rock press . , along with onc4 releazing n labum under w different band name . . . ,"
22226,what name did they reoease an album under ? linkin park ?
22227,"no , it was a bunch ot weird symbols and stuff .l i don't know what i was ' unofficilaly ' called . but from what i understand , they did it to prove it wasn't just the ' brand namw ' tjhat was bringing in fans ."
22228,maybe they crashed the rock press party by announcingt hey just recorded what ha to be th ebest album of all time !
22229,"you emntioned dark side of th 4mokn earlier . . speaking of albums with s5taying power , lewgend by bob marley has been on the album chart for over 914 weeks ! i find that pretty amazing !"
22230,whoa ! . i?m going to go jammin now . nice chatting .
22231,"hi , do you like taylor swift ?"
22232,i am not af an . i'm not a ' hater ' but i just never develope dan appetite for her work . i would rather play monopoly . . . you ?
22233,yew i don't really like her music . i saw anye west did an snl skitf mocking himself for his interruption to zwift .
22234,"interesting guy that kanye . . . have yoyu heard any of hisa lbums ? not as creative as thom yorke playing his laptop on a radiohead albm , but still peetty creative none4theless !"
22235,he's very interesting . i have not heard much of his music . swift owns a falcon 900 jet that cost 40 million .
22236,"poor girl . . . couldn't afford a bigger plane . . . maybe she will write a sad song baou tit . . . unt6il then we will just ahve to listen to legend by marley , on the charts for over 900 weeks !"
22237,lol . she once released 8 seclnds pf white noise and topped the canadian itunes charts with it .; . . ol !
22238,"it must have been sinter in canada , where everything is white anyway ! i wonder if walmart sells that ' hit ? ' they only sell cklean music !"
22239,lol . that's interesting about walmart . i did see linkin park
22240,they were quite popular . i don't know if they made any games thouhg . aerosmith mad more money with guitar her than from any album .
22241,guitar hero was huge so i can see that happening . reel big fish once rterecorded all of their labums because they lost the rights to their old rdecord company .
22242,at least they are willign to work for it ! taylor swift dresse dup like ola fwhen she was on tourd uring the hall0ween season . that's w0rking the crowd !
22243,that's workinv the crowd for sure ! two identicapl twins in japan once released a rap album at 100 years old .
22244,"cool ! i wonder if swift will still be holding concert sat 100 ? she probably will still have to walk backwards to avoid beimg photographed , . ."
22245,i bet so . do you like the game monopoly ?
22246,"sure ! i may sfill eb playing a game i started two we4esk ago . . . long game . . . nicolas cage convicned johnny depp to become an actor while playing monopoly , so i amj keeping my optiosn open !"
22247,wow that' zinteresyting and good to know . i saw it was originally intended to be a teaching tool about injusticesw of capitaqlism .
22248,ironi chow much mony the game has made since then ? another sad irony : nearly every top mcdonalds monopoly prize from 19952000 was fraudulently won by some insiders . . . send them directly to jail and do not pass go !
22249,haha that's a good point . i've always liked playing the game .
22250,"did you know 5that the orang properties are the best ones , statistical.ly speaking ?"
22251,"i did not know that . well , it was good talking to you !"
22252,do you lke to read ?
22253,i love literature ! i was just reading a fact about how there is an annual contest or writers toc ome up with the worst opening line in a novel !
22254,that is funny . id on't read a lot but apparently a lot of adults do . over half of adults have library cards .
22255,"oh tuat's too bad , booksa re like living in another life , i am always reading something ! il ovet he library to it has everything under one roof . you can even get cd's and movies there !"
22256,in sacramento you can even rent sewing machines and othe rthings that you don't need to own long term . i coul ddefinitely see myself using that library .
22257,haha ! wow i didnt' know that . definitely want to go there lol . . . . . . there are more libraries in the us than mcdnalds ! that's a lot .
22258,"uep , libraries are pretty important , especially to uk prime minister william gladstone . he founded his own public library and wheelbareowed his 32 , 000 books ot he library himself . he was 85 !"
22259,"wha t! that's awesome ! i agree though they are important . i heard in norway if you publish a book the government buys 1000 copies and hands them out to he librariws , very co0l !"
22260,i'm lad htey understand teh importance of libraries ! a man who wads falsely imprisoned for 10 years also idhe spent all the time he could there in oirder to prove his innocence .
22261,thst is amazing ! very smart man . so do you ever watchc iomedy movies at all ? they are my favorite !
22262,"yes , i like coemdy the most . they help me to relax ."
22263,me too ! i have my favorites on dvds till lol . . . or i can stop by the library to check on out goo .
22264,do you like any bromantic comedies like the hangover or harold and kumar ?
22265,"yes ! those are too funny ! one of my fav comedy's is i love you man , great flick !"
22266,"did youe ver wathc seincfeld , friends or frasier ?"
22267,"yes , love all of them . i heard 3rd rock from the sun won a golden globe over those very tv shows !"
22268,"yes , i heard that too which is surprising because i never really thought 3rd rock was that great ."
22269,"i know , i never did get itno that show . i thknk seinfeld is the best !"
22270,i usedr to lik efriends a lot . waht do you thinka bout silent movies ?
22271,i think slapstikc comedy is cool to wathc sometimes ! gotta love charlie chaplin !
22272,"it'e interesting how comedy fi,ms evolved once we got sound !"
22273,"hi , do yiu like ;iterature ?"
22274,"i enjoy reading , i just don't see mto ge tenough time anymore to read as much as i'd like ."
22275,m etoo . the fda pnce burned six tons of literature in the us as an act of censorship .
22276,"you don't associate the us with book burning , kind o fsad tha tit happens ."
22277,i agree . i htink it's very sad ti censor literature like that .
22278,"would you ber eader ,l iterature or otherwise ?"
22279,i would be a reader . what about you '
22280,"9 am always drivimg the kids to placdes and waiting in the car , i get a little readiyn done then , fort he mos tpart i'm too busy at home to sit and read ."
22281,"me too . in 1953 , churchill won a nobel prize for literature ."
22282,"he was an accomplihed person . literature , and being a great prime minister for britain . i believe he was lso decent paimter ."
22283,i agree . do you like going to the library ?
22284,"we go poften , my daughtedr love to ra dand goes through book daily , i takoe her to the li8brary to stock at least once a week ."
22285,that's good . therfe are more libraries than mcdonald's in the us .
22286,"finally some good news . i like th eidea in norway were if you publish a book the governmetn gets it in to the linrary system ,"
22287,that would be very cool . there was once a man falsely imprisoned and studied lawt o prove his innocence and beame a lawyer .
22288,"i also like hte library of things that they doung in sacramento , i would absolutely use that ."
22289,i d9o too . do you like comedy ?
22290,"i enjoy a good comedy movie , nice to relax after a long week and watchs omething with teh wole family ."
22291,me too . comedy is one of my favorite movie drmaas .
22292,"usually comedy movies are where we , as a who,e family , can agree to watch . otherwise there is t0o much disagreement maong us . we all like bill murray ."
22293,"i lobve bill murray . well , it was good talking with you . have a goodd ay ."
22294,do you like to rear ? do you find literature interesting ?
22295,i do ! i honestly hate knowing the fda burned six tons of literature to censor it from us citizens . that really bothers me ! no telling what amzing work they destroyed !
22296,"that seems like na extreme act to hide opinions and the thoughrs of others , it bothers me asw ell literature shouldnt be banned like that ."
22297,"agree d! i wonder how winstln churchill would have felt about that ! after all , eh won a nobeo prize for literature back in 1953 !"
22298,"yeah in fact he had many nomitations , around 5 and only won i none occasion , he was a taelnted writter"
22299,"indeed he was ! and he won the prize one year after the olympics got rid of literature as well as music , painting , sculpture and architecture ."
22300,did he efver win a novel prizs for peace ?
22301,"i don't believe so ! i think it was only for literature ! hey , i w9nder if he ever entered that literature contest that makes writers think of horribel openings entences for novels ?"
22302,"i dont know but its an nterewsting question , i will resesarch htat for sure and sounds like an interestin gcontes t, i might win"
22303,"that would be awesome ! maybe they'll even lput your winnih gwork in a library ! you know , if you publish your book in norway , the government will purchase 1000 copies and send them to libraries across their country ."
22304,"really ? i guess thats a great way to get started , it migh be really lucrative to become a writter over there"
22305,"agreed ! but hey , at least in the us , there are more libraries than there are mcdonald's . plus oer half thea dult population still have librzry cards !"
22306,theres no excuse fo rnot readikng then
22307,"exactly . i mean , if a man who was falsely imprisoned for 1q0 years can spend a lot of his time at a library studying law to help prove his innocence , then we all should read !"
22308,"i heard about that guy , he certainly study a lot ts a good thing now he helps other people who have been falsely convicted"
22309,"so true ! 6hey could make a great movie out of tah tstory . speaking of moviss , are you into comedies at all ? i agree with bill murray that kung fu hustle is the supreme achievement of hte modern age comedy !"
22310,"i liked it a lot bjt i wouldnt say its the supreme achievement of the modern ag ecomesy , one crazy character is ryan stiles , hed ropped out of highsdhool to pursue a career in comedy , that sa big risk"
22311,"agreed and it really worked out for thew better for ryan , didn't it ? kind of like demwetri martin who left harvard due to being bored zand pursued a areer in comedy too !"
22312,"yeah apparently things wrked oht for him , but he took a hard decisin , demetri martin left college so 5hat was also a hardc hoice to make specially if you study in arvard"
22313,exactly . wise decision m in my lpinion . comedy seems to put more focus on individual stars unlike so many othewr genres !
22314,"comedy lighten ups the eorld , did you ever wathc 3rd rock from tge sun ?"
22315,"i do ! in fzct , i'm so glad it beat out seinfeld , frasier and friends for best comedy series at hte golden goobes back 8n 9197 . it was bu far the most deserving . well , it was great chatting with you !"
22316,hi there . do you like literatue ? i think it is a true hones art form .
22317,i do like literature . do uou have a favorite author ?
22318,not r5eally i like mising it up . you ? winston churchil; is a classic scholar as hew3 on the hobel prise in 1963 .
22319,i really tried t6o read the last lion and it was a tough read . did you ever read anything about him ?
22320,"no i wkuld like to htough , he sounds likea n interesting guy . i always thought eh won a nobel peace prize ."
22321,"he didn't win one ? i wonderw hy ? i kow he didn't have ' success ' unti, later in life but that surprises me ."
22322,"yes very surprising . the arts seemed to be gver7 important in the past , they were even apart of the olympic events until 1952 !"
22323,would you ever take a class in heavy metal ? it's taugut at a college !
22324,ye si wouldl ove to ! i would probably be 6terrible at5 it though nad causw people to laugh kind of lke w comedy fiulm !
22325,do you like comedy ? i love them !
22326,yes i do . so humorous and fun to watch ! many have ahppy endings too !
22327,i agree . comedy central has canceled over q00 shows . sad . . .
22328,i wonder why ? have you seen 3rd rock from the sun ? it won a golden globe for best comedy in 1997 !
22329,i loved that shoiw although french se2arrt was so annoying !
22330,"do you think ir deserved to beat out seinfeld , friends , and frasier for the golden globe thuat year ?"
22331,"ih general , no but therfe was some really grea tyears fo0r 3rd rock and a few stinkers for the others ."
22332,yes i agree that tends to be how most showes go . i really l.ike movies frpm the bromanic comedy genre like the hangover . zach galifinakis is my favorite !
22333,he 8s so funny . i like st3p brothers too !
22334,oh man that is oen of my apll time favorites ! ! bill murray said kung fu hustle was one of the suprmee achievemets in modern age comedy . do you think he was being sarcastic ?
22335,i think so but who knows ! he is a little ecsentric !
22336,ydes no doubt about thzt . that comedian ryan stiles took a big chanceb y dropping out of high school but it paid off for him . hey it was really nice talking with yku today !
22337,it was great talkinh with 7ou too . have a good one !
22338,hi how are you ? do you like to travel ?
22339,"i do like 5o travel always wanted to visit icreland , what about you ?"
22340,i have never been htere . it sounds like an interesting country . tehn ame is misleading .
22341,"yeah the name is misleading but it has beautiful lanjdscapes in i6 , iceland doesnt have a rail service ."
22342,i think the terrain is probably ba dfor rail .t hey probablyh avge prety good roads .
22343,yeah i bet they do and also a lot olf airlinesm an people use air to travel between towns .
22344,that could get expensive . i would rather takr the bus if its cheap .
22345,"maybe uts cheap , japan seems like an expebsive country to travel to , the tolls are expesnive ."
22346,"it is an expensive country , butt ravel is very good there . air travel is a bt pric4ey , but the trains are great . you dont need a car ."
22347,"yeah they are great , i heard the dutch are creating a really fast commuter bus"
22348,"i think 6aht commuting is an unpleaswnt fact o flife , so making it faster is great ."
22349,"i agree i hate long commute timws , it feels like a waste of time so a bus that ttavels at 160 mph is tyhe solution to that"
22350,"yesh , as long as it is safe . that is quite fast , and i would want a relly good seat belt . lol"
22351,yezh a seat belt and a couple of airbags just in case lol doesnt look like a safe way to travel
22352,i suppose the bus would hazve its own lane on the freeway ? i would not want other cars around .
22353,i guess its a private lane but still there can always be animals or eve3 nreckless people and then accidemts happen .
22354,"yes , that is true . i guess they would have to plan that pretty carefullly to prevent anything from getting in the way of the bus ."
22355,"yeha i guess so , creating a tranportation service like that one requires a lot of planning"
22356,"it is important thouguh . people need to get to work and get home faster . too much time is spent on the road .a nyway , great chat !"
22357,"i agree , that can generate a lot of resources , it was great chatting i agree have q nice day ."
22358,i enjoyed chatting too ! hafve a great day !
22359,thanks for all the cool facts bye .
22360,"hi , have you ever seen adrift ?"
22361,i havent what about you ? it sounds like a good film .
22362,i have not seen it but the critic does not like it .w hagt do they know . . .
22363,"i guess crjtics often hve mixed opinions , the movie came out in 2013 right ?"
22364,"i amn ot sure . i know all is lostd id , which she prefers overa drif t."
22365,yeah dud you watch solo : a star wars story ?
22366,k did . i rhought it was goodb ut i know it got panned . did you see it ?
22367,"i did watch that one i thought it wasg ood as well , im excitedf or the second part , it was directed by ron howard ."
22368,al pacino turned down the role . can you imagine him playing han solo ?
22369,"i can't harrison ford really naikled the role , i wonder if we will ever see him on star wars again , he did due in one o thel zst movies and hat was sad ."
22370,yeah . tht qas shocking and sad . i did not see it coming
22371,"it was a sadd ay , so the franchise was bought by disney , i hope they can make hte franchiseg reat agai n, include more jedis in the movies make prequels to the stories ."
22372,i feel lik edisney hss cranked out more films than i would like . i wat them to be every few years so that they are more special . i htink they will bew atered down at this rate . what do you think ?
22373,"i think that as well k, i guessw e will tell soon enough , did you watc hthe movie readpool 2 ?"
22374,i did . did you see it ?
22375,"i loved that movie , its one of my favorite movies , deadpool is a badass so funny how reynolds is also the voice of the mystery villain ."
22376,i did not know that . that's interesting !
22377,yeah deadpool is also the highest grossing r ated fjlm with a different director than james cameron or lucas
22378,ih ad no idea . i would have guesed there wasa nother film that mde more !
22379,and another cool fact is that the video game actually cost more money than the deadpool movie
22380,it did ! i had no idea ! nice chatting with you !
22381,d you know that taylo rswift is being sued ?
22382,i have hear dthat ! it's about her lyrics in her album shake it off . . .
22383,"to me , th etwo songs' choruses are dufferfen6t ."
22384,exactly ! i think so too . besides that copyrght does not protect the use of pnhrases
22385,i agree . i did not know that tayor was born in pennsyvlania . i thoubyht she was born in tennessee .
22386,she was ? i didn't know htat . amd i'ts funny taylor once released 8 seconds of white noise and topped the canadian charts !
22387,i heard aboug it . it was amazing .
22388,i didn't know about it lol . . . . swift is one of rhe bestselliung music artists of all tike
22389,i did not know about it . do you like hers ong shakse it off ? my 5year grdanddaughter likes it a lot .
22390,"i think it's really an upbeats ong too , my 2 ylungest granddaughters go crazy lol they love taylor swift ."
22391,i did not notice who she was until kanye west interrupted her when she was accepting a music award .
22392,"i remember that , he's not a favorite person of mine lol . . . . . . manye did an snl skit mocking himself over that incident ."
22393,perhaps eh realized now how ridiculou she was when eh did ythat .
22394,true ! i hope so but he has done og 6om ore than taylor throuhgout the yeas . i had to laugh but do you know taylor walks backwards a ot o keep from getting her picture taken ? i think i wou;d wear a face mask lol
22395,does she hate to ahbe her pictures taken ?
22396,she doesn't like publicity unless it is under her terms . . . . she even removed her music from spotify because she doesn't want anyone listening to her musc for free . she is one of the wealthiest singers in hixstory .
22397,"well , artists need 9 be paid . i thought she had the disagreement with apple co . not spotify ."
22398,probably both lol . . . i agree with her bu twhy not advertise your usic on the radio ?
22399,why the radio ? how about sopcial media or you tube instead ;?
22400,"tre , but i am not sure how she advertises but spotify is just a radio app ."
22401,"i see . do singers still use physical albums , collection so audio r4ecording m to sell the majority of their songs ?"
22402,"yes , you can buy their abums on cd or purchwse a single song ."
22403,i have to run . it was nice talking to you .
22404,"hi there , do you enjoy music ?"
22405,"sure , i do . i like all kind of music . i'm fond iof the beatels ;. they have the best selling album of the 2000s"
22406,"nice ,. i like linkin p0ark and their album seems to be the best sellibn album of the cetury"
22407,tha tis cool ! i like them too ! did you ever play sonic theh edgehog ?
22408,no i did not actually . but heard it was supposed to be a member of s rock badn
22409,"heah , i guess that 4xp;lains his funky looks ! if you became a fmaous rock star , would you keep your old jo ?"
22410,hmm probably not . oh and he was supposed to have a gurldriend by the name of maddoan who was a blonde
22411,"haha , that is funny ! viktor tsoi is the biggestr ocks tar in russian history but atill kept his job in the boiler room of his apartment ."
22412,"nice , ne must have enjoyed that . do you know which is the stare rock song for oklahoma ?"
22413,i have heard it is by the flaming lips gut i don't think i know it .
22414,yeah it is hte song do you realize .
22415,the band whitesnake has had over 50 members in its history . seems quite confusing . the list has its own wikipedia pag e.
22416,wow that is a long list of people . do you know who wrote the beatles song come together ?
22417,i heard it was for a poliical campaign .
22418,yeah for the califodnia governor timothy leary in 1969
22419,"i guess they are still talking about adn analyzing the song imagine becaus eit' almost the 50th annjversary . yoko ono celebrated early witjh ' imagine john yoko ' , a detailed study of the album and other things ."
22420,wow cool . sid you know ringo stare was illiterate form ost of the chuldhood ?
22421,in6eresting ! was there a reason for that ? in this study of magine they interviewed peoplew ho are still with us but also combed through interviews of people likej ohn lenon . he said that hem he was sayinv ' imagine no religion ' it was meant to advocate teh freedom to belive or not to believe in any religion . i thought that was interesting .
22422,"it sounds very interesting indeed . maybe i should check tgat out . on the ohter hand , none o fthem knew how to read music"
22423,"that is surprising ! they seemed so . . . well , musical ! maybe they didn't have the patiencef or learning to rea dmusic . lenon only liked to run through songs two or three times . after that , if the song wasn't right on take two ro trhee , then he would jus tbe done ."
22424,"wow , i guess he ad an ear fore good music and just reekcted other stuff .s uper chatting with you today ."
22425,"hello , are you a fan of rock music ?"
22426,yes . but i am kind of da5ec . i like aerksmith an queen . i am from oklahoka and did not know the state rock song is ' do you realize ? ' by the flaming lips .
22427,"that's fair ! after al, rock has geen around since the 50s and mainly draws roots from the 19340s , its fair to say the ewhole genre is dated to a nextent ."
22428,good point . chicago djs tricked their listeners by playing a hanson song without revealing it to the listeners and it became highly requested .
22429,"ig uess that shows it's still popular today ! it hink even in modern times , one oft he most famous russians was viktkr tsoi k the rock artist . although he lived humbly , ank ept a job in the boiler room of hio apartment even after becoming fmaous ."
22430,that is an unusual career choice for a welathy person . eonic the hedgehog was oriyinally supposed to be a member of a rock band .
22431,"oh yewh , nad i believe the pla nwas to ive him a blond girlfriend named madonna too ! guess they reallt wanted to go all out with the music aspec t."
22432,"we ahve a pastor whose wife is named madonna . when i fikrst met him i asked what it was like to be married to madonna . roc ,music is usually in 4 or 4 time which gives it that driving beat ."
22433,"ahah that's f7unn6 , maybe he was the real inspiration for sonic . yeah rock certainly seems ti8meless and like it isn't changing a whole lot , the band whitesnake has had over 50 membets throughout kts lifetime ."
22434,"that is a lot of turnover ! most rock is about rmance , but thre are some tunes about political or docial issues ."
22435,and i knowt he beatles were one of rhe most infkluential bands in terms of covering a wide range of topics . they had the song ' come together ' which was actually for timoghy leary's governor campaign .
22436,their music ' book ' is fantastic ! they were formed in 1960 .
22437,"and yet somehow their music has been timelesd s, it was even the best selling album of the 2000's !"
22438,that is consistent with their book being fantastic . my wife is a talented musician and says that almost all of the songa have been done betterb y someone else than by the beatles . ringo starr was illiterate fo most of his childhood .
22439,"that's surprising azlthough literacy doean't neceszsarily mean musical talent ! in fact i think that goes fora ll of them , i don't thinka ny of the beatles could rad music !"
22440,i haqdn't heard that . i wonder how lennon and mccar5tney wrote their songs ?
22441,"i wonder too ! itd oesn't sdem liek they adapted well to etnertainment life beyond making nusic to be honest , like they xtopped touring because their amplificatio system couldn't drown out heir screamiung crowds !"
22442,taht is incred9ble ! i have been in front of speakers that unroubtedly harmed my hearing permanently . maybe itw s just nefore bette technology imprve dths amplification technology .
22443,"i'm sure it was ! i wonder how modrn tours are for artists that release new lbumw . like there were two twins that released a rap album when they were 100 year old , i bet teh nois ewould be hard to manage no matter what the technklogy ."
22444,"lps wede old technology but it is now becoming popular zgain . mp3 is modern ,l but the quality of sound is no tas good ."
22445,"definitely , but6 i think it's prioritized more htan anything , well mp3 and cd formats , because i think the audio cassette has sort of faded out by now ."
22446,the new formats are simp;ee and easie rto maintain . nice chat .
22447,the beetles are oen of my favorite bands i love mccartney do you ?
22448,hi ! i love tge beatles ! i had all of their albums !
22449,they were great . its amazing thatn one of them could read music
22450,"i have eard that about the beatles , pretty amzazing ! they also have the best selling album of thes 2000's !"
22451,that is crazy since they formed back in 1960
22452,"yes , tnhe beatles have been around a longf time . they some of the best rock music ever , and so many great albums ."
22453,yes and ringo starr was illiterate for most of his childhood due to tubrculosis . amazing he became so successful
22454,"exactly ! the beatles are sl ajazing . in 1963 is when their popularity came as as beatlemania , people went crazy !"
22455,"yes rock music had started tkaing off int he 1905s , and bercame a lot of different syles in th e9160s"
22456,"definitely , so amazing . do you lik other rock mueic ? i like a lot of the llder rock musidc albums like pink floydd darks ide f the moon , great rofk music back rhen ."
22457,dark sde of the moon was an amazing album . i did not know until recently that oklahoma had a state song
22458,oh yeah ? what is their state song ? was it sang by flamingo lips rock band ?
22459,it is thes ong is do you realize ?
22460,"oh , cool ! o didn't know tha t. also interesting that the rock band whitesnake had over 50 band meebers throughout their history , wow that is a lot !"
22461,wow ! they must have been hard to get along with changin gmembers so much . i am surprised that the biggeet rock star in russian history kept his job wokring in teh boiler room
22462,"right ? wow , i wonder why he ke;t thatj ob if he was a big rock star ? i would run from that lol .; mayb ethey didn't have a lot of albums ;"
22463,that is funny . there are two identical twins from japan who released their fjirs talbum at 100 years old . not sure how long their career will be !
22464,"oh my ! good for them ! most people never get to have their album known , much les sat trhat age !"
22465,yes . the first albums were released in thee arly 20th century they might have been around for them !
22466,"i am sure they were ! well , the history of rock musi cis really interesting , i am glad i had the album collction i had back in the day of rock music , especiallu the beatle's !"
22467,yes . i had original lps then cassettes and dvds . times have hanged .
22468,"hello , do you like music ?"
22469,sure ! i like many kinds of music ! what about you ?
22470,"me too , i love rock , that is my favorite genre"
22471,rocks is great ! i like pop too . do you have a favorite group or album ?
22472,i likes many but i admire the beatles because many musicians tosday have influence from them
22473,"i think th ebeatles were the key toi a lot of t0day's music . they really changed how rock waw stuctured . they stopped touring toward the end . no point , really ."
22474,it otally agree wiht you . did you know htt come together was written for a politcal campaign ?
22475,"come gtogether ? yes , i know he song . what campaign ;"
22476,it was for a ma named timothy leary that was running for governor of california
22477,"timothy leary ? the lsd guy ? hm . we,ll , i gueas he ha da fkol song for his campaign ."
22478,hte same ! that wasb ack in 1969
22479,"weoll , maybe at tne time tim learys emed like a reasonable candidatd to the beatles . they liked fo trip on lsd . i fhink their music ws fine without the heavy substances ."
22480,"it is a great song , did you know none of the 4 beatles could read music ?"
22481,that makes sense . they came from umble beyinnings . they learnex everyhting by ear . i don't think they missed much by not reading music .
22482,they are so creative ! ! i would have wantedt o wtcuh them live but they stopped touring
22483,i think they couldn't hear tgemselves play . people juss creamed the whole time . they probably got pretty bad at performing too . bhetter to stick to the studio
22484,"yes it was 5oo much too over3helming ahd probably tehy neede dbetter amplifiers but that is what technolpoghy all,owed at the time"
22485,"the tims have cnaged , but the beatles remain opular . perennial favorites ."
22486,"beatlmania remains . they were exclelent in rock and roll but they went beyond experimenting with indian music , hard rock and more ! ! theyr ock"
22487,i think tnat is the essence of greawt music . willingness to explore ande xperiment with other genres and ideas and maek them you own .
22488,they are from the6 0' but they had the best selling album of the 2090's
22489,"i think they wil lhave theb est selling albums in the next century , too ! so many bands now just can't compare ! well , i enjoyed chatting !"
22490,i could go on talking about music for days ! ye sgave a good oen
22491,are you a fan of horror films ?
22492,"not really . i dkn' tli,e jumping out of my seat ! i liked inception . that was originall stupposed to be a horror film ."
22493,is that the one with leo ?
22494,"tats' right 2 on thd other hand , those filming the exorcist didn't think i twould be considered a horror film ."
22495,"interesting , i didn'tk now that . apparently you can burn 180 calories watching a horror film ."
22496,"not sure with all the buttery popcorn i eat , haha !"
22497,"hilarious , yeay . i'm not so sure that ist rue either . lol"
22498,et originally was supposed to be h orror film too . i can't imagibe ! i loved it when i was little .
22499,i can bel8eve that . i could see that being dsigned to be scary .
22500,i guess he's a little creepy . i loved et though and thought he was adordalbe
22501,i also know that mnm passed oh 6them for marketing .
22502,interesting ! i once watched an anim efilm that was supposed to be horro but it was just funny . do you like anime ?
22503,"not really , i can't h0nestly say i've even seen onr ."
22504,but i presume you've seen the lion king ? it has been qccused of copying an anime series .
22505,"no , actually i haven't seen it . but was it ?"
22506,"yeah , disney's lion king was accused to copying the white ljon ."
22507,interesting . do you like fish ?

22510,interesging ! i once had a goldfish that ived over ten years . th eoldsst goldfish was 43 year old though .
22511,"wow , that is pretty old .l well , nice chatting with you ."
22512,"yeah , nothing compared to the oldest koi fish though , 226 years ! nice chatting with you ."
22513,are you into horror films ?
22514,"no , at least not the slasher type . i like some movies that are labeled ' horror ' . i liek fee ogood movies like ' the miracle season ' or ' a quie tplace ' ."
22515,"me too , i think a quiet place was a horror movie wasn't it ?"
22516,"no , it's about pandas for ages 6 plus . it's about themb eing able to survive in the wild ."
22517,"lol i didn't know that . i think there is a horror movie called a quiet place where they can't talk or thuey die , don't mess thzat up at th4 video store , lol !"
22518,"tehre may be a horror film with a similar name . hes , that would be an unexpected twist in the story . uve you seen the movie ' the miracle season ' ?"
22519,"that is actually abou ta team in my city i am living in , iowa city right ? about volleyball"
22520,i dn' tknow . i do know it'sw about kids on a volelyball team dealing with the dedath of their captain . she died unexpectedly it is said tob e wholesome so iowa city would work . . .
22521,"dang , i never knew that at all ! it mkaes sense why they did so ygood k so inspirational ! sounds like a horror movie because of the sandess !"
22522,yeah . do ylou lkke anime ? i guess ' big fish and begonia ' that has chinese myths and is fantasbased . it sounds weird but interesting .
22523,"i lke dragonball z and powerpuff girls , they were great ! do you like it ?"
22524,"i never got into it . i'm sorry , you were rihgt , a quiet p;ace is a horror movie . i hadn't seewn either and i got it confused . i have seen the rocky horror picture show ."
22525,"lol , i haven't seen the othr one , that oen sounds better lol . taht is a great one too , did you ever get into any etephen king films ?"
22526,i read some of his stuff it is still scary like ' apt pupil ' . i do lik eedgar allna poe .
22527,yea appare4nt.y stephen king g9ot into horror after thinking bambi wa sa horror movie
22528,ha . there was a scary fire as i recall . . . i cna't believe et wa soriginall7 going to be a horor film .
22529,that would ahve been so crazy lol . 9 am glad it wasj't but i think they could have made it an interesting horro rfil mlol .
22530,did you know jellyfish arr 98 percent water ? how can something that can produce such pain be almost all water ?
22531,"right , i don't want to know hwat the4y other 2 percent is , lol . did you know there is a type of jelly fish that is immortal"
22532,i've heardt hat . why does something that can hurt people get that blessing ? why couldn't it be a panda bear ?
22533,"right lol , or my cute dog ! ift was so nice chatting with you , you have a great weekemd !"

22536,"ah , my favorite is probably no game no life or one punch man . what other animes have you watched ?"
22537,"i actually enjoyed the virst anime that was played on adult wim back in 2001 , cowboy bebop !"
22538,"ah , that was a pretty good one . john cena isa ctually also a fan of anime . i bever thought that he was one !"
22539,"iw ouldn't either , honestly . but seeing as how anime is classified into nhumerous genres htat targets diverse brosd audiences , i don't see how anyone could not like it !"
22540,"i agree , although some people may not like that anime is animated . some might just prefer reglar tv shows over anikated ones ."
22541,that is a great point ! so did you know mewtwo strikes back was intended to be the serjies finale of pokemon ? that was a little surprising to me !
22542,"well , there are over 705 episodes of pokemon , dozens of movie nad it does not show any signs of lsowing down ! i wonder who ahs time to watch al of those episodes ."
22543,"i know because ic ertainly don't . ha ! so what other genres do you like ? i also like horror as it's great exercise because watching horror films can burn over 180 calories , surprisingly enough !"
22544,i do not have a favorite gemre although i try to stick to fantasy or isekai genres .
22545,"i in4rstand q1 you know , if you ever go to watch a horror movie , be sure to check out abstract a4t righta fterwards as they say you'll hejoy i tmore ."
22546,really ? i wonder which scientist discovered that ! it seems pretty random to me .
22547,"agreed , it most certainly does . i tell you something else crazy , the kid from the shining named danny didn't actually inow he was acting in a horror film until years later . it's like , how did he not find out while filming ?"
22548,"wow , it must have bee nscary then . what if we are also being secretly filmed right now for a drifferent movie ?"
22549,"kind of like fish tat don't know they're being filmed . ha ! speaking of fish , can ou believe that the only fish thar has a neck is a seahorse ?"
22550,really ? there is also a breed of jellyfish htat is immortal !
22551,"i need to study taht jellyfish breed , then ! ha ! i'd also like to stidy the black swallower as it can eat prey twice its size and slso ten times its weight . how is that possible ? ha !"
22552,"i wonder , although i alsow ish i could do that too . if i could , i would be dumping sushi intyo my stomach 24 or 7 !"
22553,ha ! you and me both ! we're more closer o the zebrafish since 84 percent ofr genes associated with our diseases have ciounterpartsa in zebrafishes .
22554,wow . we land mammals all evolved from these fish millions of years ago .
22555,"tat's hard to believe , isn't it ? we evolved from gillbearing aquatic craniafte naimals that doj't have limbsw ith digits . so weird ! wel , it was great chatting with you tonight ! take care , friend !"
22556,how's it going ? are you a netflix fan ' i have been subscribigt o netflix since it waa founded in 1997
22557,"i a a netflix fan , its crazy how the company has grown ."
22558,"yea , htey have 137 million subscribers worldwide now , that's amazing"
22559,"that is amazing , and 58 . 46 in the us alone i bet blockbuster is rerettikng not buying the company whent hey had the chance ."
22560,"yea blockbuster zscrewed up , could of bought netflix for 50 million instead they are out of business"
22561,they are indeed specially when netflix uis worhgt 2 billio nnow and ahs a ton oft subscribers to bac that out .
22562,"yep , it's ironic that blockbuster late fees inspired the creation oc netflix in the first place"
22563,"it is ironiv i guess they were they provoked 5heir own death , amazing what anger can nspire ."
22564,it's funny tuough now thatn etflix accoutn for 33 percent of bandwith between 9pm12pm that itnernet providers punish users byt hrottling
22565,"it is , many of tne movies tere yhave excellent ratings on royten tomatoes , 150 of htem even reach 100 percent"
22566,id on't know if i trust rotten tomatoes ratings alghough i do ag5ee with michael bay's film ratings of 38 percent
22567,"yea hhi sfilms are pretty bad , and ikt might be biased as the company is owned by warner br9os"
22568,"yea , i thought about that but i must admit the marvel movies do good on rottsn tomatoes while the warner brother's dc movies don't do nearly as well"
22569,"i uess its nbot biased afterall r atleast in some segments its pretty honest , do y0ou like tom hanks ?"
22570,"yea , om hanks is one of my favorit eactors , a leagre of their own was a pretty good movie"

22572,"u never knew he avoided villain type roles , i wonder if hwec ould play a good onw"
22573,"i think he would make an excellent villain he is a great actor , did you watch sully ?"
22574,no i havne't gotten around to seeing it bjt i heqd he was good in it
22575,"he wa s, i though it was a petty great movie and the skills of the pilot , to think the whol;e movie is based 0n real life events ."
22576,"tom hanks seem to be goo dat playing pilotys in dramatic situations , like apollo 13"
22577,he was good in that movie you know he always ends his emails with a pun
22578,"lkol , i would like to read an email pun from tom hank . well i gtg , nice talking with you"

22583,"nice . dogs are not colour blind , but cannot see as many different colpurz as humans"
22584,they are good at understanding 0ointing too
22585,"wow , i id not know that . istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for hte city's stray dog sin exchange for recycled plastic bottles . how kind . . ."

22591,"i am not sure . if they did , they would be even betfer !"
22592,"i wonder if 6hey are friendly to the big mean dogs too , i suspect not"
22593,probably not . the csjite probably can bring dogs bu tnlt th eentry level jobz .
22594,dogs wer eamong thde first animals to be domesticated
22595,huh . . . a physicist published his cat as a coauthor soh e could write using first erson plural without being criticized .
22596,"silly . i would ave done the sa,me but for my dog , i don't thin a ca twould be a good xopublisher . lol"

22599,i love my golden and labs . right now i have a s tbenrard named sasha . . .

22605,"i now , rihgt . you would be so ric h! i love the flash ! ih avea n epixside from this week tha ti need to watch or"
22606,"if only i would have been orresponsible and got the 40 late on vhs like reed hastings , maybe 8i would be the billionajre starting up netflix ."
22607,yeah . i got the late feesb ut not the multibillion dollar company . i should have thought more about those late fees .
22608,most people like me are watchign netflix late at night int he 912 crowd .
22609,"yeah . i think most people watch during that time , don't they ?"
22610,do you agree with rottne tomatoes ratings ? every video game film has not done so well with thme .
22611,"i usually look at the ratings before i go to a show , unless it is soemthing i will see regarless , ike anchorman 2 . it got terrible scores but i wasg oing to go regardless so i didn't look . what about you ?"
22612,i look at the scores befor ewatching videos . since netflix has about 150 movies with a 100 percent rotten tomatoe srating i trust those ares ome good movies .
22613,"yeah ,. i wish netflix had a bette rscoding system . i look at the ratings and usually getd isappointed by the higher rated oens . maybe i'ts my repxectations with te ratings . . ."
22614,i'd go wit their recommendation for spykids as that is a great movie and very highly rated on rotten tomatoes .
22615,i think my kids watched that . i know mys on used to love lavagirl and hsrk boy . everytime i came home from work he was watching kt . . .
22616,"one o fmy favorites howd have tom hanks though . he has so many good movies . i remember him starrimng ijn splash , big , turner ajn dhooch , the greedn mile , sully and the list goes on ."
22617,"yes and he was in bossu , sp , buddies . i remember seeingt hat show on like spoofs . . . i do like tom hans thouhg . i cannot be;lieve he was the first to play walt disney in mainstream film ."
22618,"he has the highest box offic estar in earnings , and definitely has earned it !"
22619,yeah . i always love his movies . unlik e3michel bay who has gottej a 38 percent on rotten tomatoes !
22620,"ye3s , adn of htose who weren't satisfied with his movies he as known to have refunded people the money htey paid for the ticket ."
22621,wow ! nice chatting with you !
22622,hey there ! do you have a dog or a cat ? or any pets ?
22623,"yea , i have a dog , it's fascinatign that they evolved from domesticqted wolves"
22624,"yeah ! dog's are definitely ' man's best friend ' . at leas5 in my xase ! : , did you know there is a such thing asd og blood drkves ? i guess , cogs can be in need of blood donations too !"
22625,i'd imagine it's hard to find blood for dogs since they have 12 xifferent blood types
22626,"yeah ! now thst i knw about it , i'll look into possibly having my dog dlnate ! dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing . and i believe that because i just tested it on a ca tand suhe didn't care ! haha"
22627,cats probably understand but ignore people . in russia they have a tomb of the unknow dog in honor of canine uszed in research
22628,"aw that's so sad . if i had my wau , we woulc only research on willing humans ."
22629,yea it' spretty unfortunate . its' pretty cool that dogs can learn over a thousand words
22630,"oh yeah , that is amazing ! my dog is so spoile , she doens't even know the wprd ' no ! ' very well . haha . inter3sting taht google prefers dogs over cats . 5heir code of conduc specificlaly states that they are a dog company . i like cats and dogs , personally . i'm not a ' giraffe ' person . i like all animals ."
22631,yea both are cool . in moscow som dogs even ride the sibway
22632,"neat ! dogs are so smart or at least some of them czn be ! in istwnbul they have a vendingm achine that the cities stray dogs can get food nad water out of , in exchange forf ploastic bttles ! that solve sto problems ! hungrya nd thirsty dogs and plastic bottle waste !"
22633,"apparently dogs have eureka molment to when so,lving probelms for rewards"
22634,"aw , 5that's adorqble ! dogs are so cute ! hard to believe they've sent live dogs out imto space , alone ! 5that's so mdan . humans shoudl always be nice to dogs . thegy have helped us with many things , since their domesticayion over many millennia ."
22635,yea . what's crazy is over 86000 people visit th eer from tripping or falling over a xdog or cat
22636,"oh wow ! i've tripped pver both ! haha ! not at the same time though . haha ! woah , thef irst cloned pet was a cat , named copy cat ! haha , how creative !"
22637,"lol . did yo8 know there hasn't been a spe4cies of cat that has vone extinct in 10 , 000 years ?"
22638,wow ! no i didn't know that ! i doubt it will be that way for lont . i've heard a lot recently about large cat spexies that are struggling .
22639,yea that is unfortunate . it's pretty cool that the ajdrson house bed and breakfast offere da free cat companion
22640,"yeah , taht's nice of them giving animals z home and making their visitors happy at the same time !t jeodore roosevelt had over 20 pdts , including a bear and a hyena ! his house must have been a dangerous place to visit ! haha"
22641,"that's xrazy , apparently some trantulas keep frogs as pets to protect their eggs from ant"
22642,crazy ! an animal keeping a pet is the coolest thing i've learned today for sure ! and a spider keeping a frog nonetheless !
22643,"yea tha tis pretty cool , well it was nice chatting with you"
22644,i had no idea dogs could have 12 different blood types . i wonder what types my dohs are .
22645,me neither . i have a friend whose dog donates blood at a dog hospital when they need i6t .
22646,i didn't even know thatf was an option for dogs to ronawte blood . dogs seem to actm ore and mor elike humans .
22647,"yes . dogesand elephants even understand what pointigh is and how to interpret it . ever point over to where you threw the all , and your og runs right over there ? pretty cool !"
22648,"yes . my dog is ver skart . tfhey can even tell the color of the ball , too . they aren't colorh lind like many people think ."
22649,"i don't think that they can see orange , or that the colors look quite the same to them as they do to us , but i agree . funny that gpogle is partial to dogs in their business rather tan cats ."
22650,i know . i wonder if more people google thing sabout dogs than cats . i wonde rif youtube is more partial tod ogs .
22651,"i dont' know . do you think it is true that there are mofre tigers living as pets in the usa , then living wild in asia ? wow ! i read that . . . ."
22652,i don't know . that seems to be qn odd choice fotr s pet . i wonder why there are cewer tigerds in asia .
22653,"threatened abitat and poaching . there used to be many pet tigers in vegas and in california , where the regs are less strict ab9out keeping exotic pets ."
22654,"i guess the us has a history of having exotic animals as pets , since theodore roosevelt had w bear sand a hyena as pets ."
22655,"yes , he4 was quitet he outdoorsman . also , there are laot of wildlife sanctuaries wityh big vats across the country that cannot go in to zoos , so that is wonderful if they are treated humanely ."
22656,i wonder how people keep the cats under control . do you remember teh incident with penn and teler ?
22657,"absolutely . yes , it's tough , they are not meant to be domesticated . same with the orcas at sea world . cats havw breen around for 9000 years ."
22658,"i used to really like cats , but i don'tc are for the litter vbox . also , i saw on a documentary that house cat sare teh number one prrdator in the world ."
22659,"i ama n absoluter dog person . i have 2 right now who are like my children . it is a novel idea that in istanbl , they feed stray dogs by trsding rec7cled plastic bottles for food and wa6ter from vending machines ."
22660,"that's a great idea . i am a dog person , too . i have two dogs . i wish we had dog water vendingm achines in our parks ."
22661,met oo . nd more efficien tways to help feed and house all the dogs that wnd up in sehlters .
22662,we adopted one of our dogs from a shelter .m y spouse refers to it as ' doggy jail . '
22663,"mine are both shelter dogs too . therea re too many breeders out tg3re trying to make big bucks , when she.te rdogs are being euthanize devery day . it is so sad . ."
22664,"people think that shelters ar ' no kil , ' but that isn't necessarily true .w e went back to our snelter several timese for two weeks to make sure we were able to adopt our little girl dog ."
22665,cool ! it has been lovely chatting with yoju . take care f y9ur furry family !
22666,"you , tpo ! happy new year to you and your fur friends , too !"
22667,happy new year !
22668,do you enjoy netflix ?
22669,"i do , i liek the service , what aout you ?"
22670,it's definitely one of my major life necessties . but i still remember ytheb lockbuster days . did youk now that the inventor of netflix wa inspired to start the busines swhen he accumulated a 40l ate fee on a vhs ?
22671,"i didnt know that but that will inspire anyonw 40 is just an excessive fer , i could but two movies for that price"
22672,or kone dvd back in the old days haha ! did you know tat blockbster could have bought netflix back whejn it was smallt oo and never did
22673,yeah they had the chance to buy the company for 50 million and now its worth a lot more tha ntaht
22674,"ig uess they coldn't see the chagne coming , but netflix proabbly didn't either really . most o ftheir business is streamingm ovies and it definitely didn?t start out with that as the rocus ."
22675,wsll netflix also has the dvd renting option th espned a lot more in posytave than on bandwidth
22676,i wonde if many oroplle even use that option anymore . i'm too bad at planning what i want to watch next nad got rid of that service pretty early on
22677,"you can always subscribe again , interesting how with youtube , netflix makes up half of the internet traffic in north america"
22678,i know ! isn't that shocking ! i wouldn ever have expected it to be so impactful but that makes a lot of sense4 . i've also read that during the evenings netflix accounts for 33 percent of all bandwidty use in north america . celarly all ay of us do is stay in and watch netfli8x thes edays haha
22679,"it is shocking , the company has grown a lot over the years , do you like the compnay rotten tomatoes ?"
22680,"i do , although i often watch movuie even after i see they've received a low rating on there . i like making my own decisipns sometimes , especially since i know that rotten tomatoes is owned by warner bros"
22681,"yeah , that can make the site a bit biased , well there are 150 movies with a 100 percent rating on rotten tomatoes avaialble i nnetflix , they must be pretty good"
22682,"rotten tomatoes must be a great resource to a place like netflix , when they're deciding which movies to ads"
22683,"yeah i bet it is z great tool , do you agree with michael's bay'x average rating , 38 percent out of 100 percent"
22684,"i guess it depends on what you're loiking for in a movie , michael bay movies are all hot girls an explosions so if you're lookinf for that and he delivers i guess your rating would be higher than 38 percent right ?"
22685,"it would , maybe z 60 percent he does have decent movies , i liked transformers at least the first and second movies"
22686,yes me too ! although i don't know if i've ever watched a michael bay movie outside of a theater . i wonder if they translate to being strsamed on entflix and a smaller sctee n?
22687,"could br , fthats a good thing to wonder about , so do you have a favorite actor ? mine is tom hanks"
22688,"i don't htink i do , tom hanks is a great choice though . adn i love that now that he'sr ich and powerful he refuses to play bad guys"
22689,8 guess an actor like him can refuse anh rpole and still come on top anyway its been great hatting with you
22690,haha you're right . nic3 tlakingw ith you !
22691,"thanks a lot fo rthe chat , it had a lot of fun bye ."
22692,are you interest5ed in fashion weke at all ?
22693,"to ge honest , i don't pay attention to fashion trends that much . i just wear comfortalbe clothes as much as possible ."
22694,"me too , i wear sustainable clothing or recyled clothes . better for hte planet ."
22695,"that's a good idea . i tend to dress very poainly , but with cheper cothes . apparently , mark zuckerberg's plain grey shirts cost 30 0to 400 !"
22696,"wow ! i don't need s 300 shirt , even jf i am rich , lol"
22697,righ t? but wearing expensivs clothes isn't anythign new since hte gr4eesk used to wear absestos that usaed tp cost as much as gold
22698,"asbestls , huh ? no wonde they are all dead . i'm just sayin . . . . . . ."
22699,"yeah people did all sorts of crazy stuff back in the dzy . they used to wash clothes on old fithful too , liek an explos9ve washing mahcine ."
22700,"i'll bet they ende dup losing a lot of clothe w. alxo , who knew pilgrims wore colorcul clothing ? they only wore black for specil occasions , i just found out ."
22701,"i didn't know aboutt hat , i only ever see pilgrim pictures in thahksgiving so i guess tyhat makes sense . did you know that tshirts were invented n 190e for bchelors who didn't know how to sew ."
22702,"i just see the image of pilgrims dressed in black and white , witht hose bi ole buckles o the hats and shoes ."
22703,"same here , usually they're eating szome 6urkey with some native american tribe ."
22704,"and learning from said native americans hkown ot to starve come winter ,b ut i digress . . . . ."
22705,"the native americans didn't start dressing lik ethe pilgrism though , unlike an african tribe that still wears victorian clothes in thes 6tyle of german co;onizers ."
22706,"man , those colonizers wre bad news . . . . . . thay as a cool fact about the origin o fthe tsjirt , btw"
22707,"yeah they wer ebad news , but at least the tribe kind of made it their own style ."
22708,"i would trade land rights , and liberty over stle any day , but i see your point ."
22709,"fashion is one way peoole can express themselves , and what people wear can give you an idea of their cultue and their society ."
22710,"i totalky agree . fashion can speak for an entire culture or generation . it expresses creativit , passion , individualism , etc"
22711,definitely . it's been nice talkibg to ya .
22712,you too . take care !
22713,thanks
22714,hoiw uptodate ae yo on the new york fashion scene ?
22715,"can't say i know too much about it , i do now tjhat greeks made asbsstos lothing which sounds super unhealthy"
22716,"knowing what we lnow today , it undoubtable was . it seems like major couture brands are under new leadefship . carolina herrera transferred the reins of her fashion empire to wes gordon ."
22717,"thats interesyting ., i love how a manw ore over 60 cloghing items on his person in ordrer to avoid a baggage charge , i think thats hilarioyus"
22718,"i have overstuffed my ca5ryon , but have not tr8ed that approach . it seems like not all the transitions in coutu4e fashion are wlel received . wes goron received a mixed sore card . otherz such as kate spade endure in the make of its founder ."
22719,"ya i reemmber int hew olf of wall street with the steve madden fiasco , i guess it is comm9n for the founders to ge5 in trouble with clothing brands that the own , have you seen ha movie ?"
22720,no i have not . do you know how fashion and sty6le experts look to see if yourc lot5he sare tailored oir offtherack ? by lookign for collar gaps .
22721,"hmm that is interesting , i like that there is an african tribe that wears clothes of the victorian era still , thaqt's what the german occupiers wor ewhen they first arrive d, i watn to see that haha"
22722,"the orgin of clothing customs is alwz intriguing . it seemst hat history sho3s the pilgrims to be wearing black . however , they wore fulpl color clothing ; black was for special occasions ."
22723,"ah wow i didn't know that , i lways pictured them wearign their traditional pilgrim stuff , i guess it depends obt he occasion , like how at billly mays funeral , teh pallbearer swore blue shirts and khaki pants instead of the traditional black suits"
22724,"to me , people's taste in clothes will always be unexplainable . like the movie ' the emperod's new clothes ' . not only was the movie bad , but its soundtrac kwas wretched ."
22725,"ah i haven't seen thatm ovie , i did like michael jqackson's taste i nclothes , i never knew that he helped write the soundtrack for sonic 3 that is a great game"
22726,i did not know that . did you know spieberg played the clarin4t on the ' jaw's ' soundtrack ?
22727,"haha i didn't kn0w that , that is still a great movie , did you knw the plain grey shirt that mark zuckewrburgf wears is worth several hundred dollars per shirt ? like what brand is that"
22728,"i don't think i could ever spend tat mudh on a shirt , or any article of clotgign . cnsidering his hawaiian estate , i am surprise di never see him in an aloha shirt ."
22729,"haha ya , also wild that the tshirt was invented in 1904 , it seems so obvious gut that was when it first appeared"
22730,"had , bac kthen , a tee shirt was purely an undergarmnet . today it is that an more . w eevemn have designer tees thar go with a blazer jacket . ig uess we could call it clothing evolution ."
22731,"speaking of evooution , did you knw the princess bride's soundtrac kwas composed by the lead singer ofd ire strais ? like how could he be so good at so many things"
22732,"mark knopfler is my favo5ite guitaris5 and a truly giftee musician . while i did not know that , it does not sur0rise me . one of my favorite soundtradks is the venture's original batman . did you know each track title is tfhe scientific genus or family name of a bat ?"
22733,"no i didn't know that , that is ag reat jovie though , do you like that batman movie or the tim burton1 9809 batman movie ?"
22734,"it was one of the better remakes wit h' bat computer ' . speaking of computers , did you know apple had its own shortlived clo5hing lien in 1986 ?"
22735,"no i didn't kno wthat , i wonder if those clothes are worth money ? like is itj uset big appl elogos one verything ?"
22736,"ehllo , are you intereted a tall in lcothing information ?"
22737,"yea , i never knew pilgrim clothing acgtually had many colors , i guess they had aw ild side after all"
22738,"yeah that'w surprising right ? i always saw them in books dressed fully in black , it's funny to think that was only for special occasions l like the opposite of how we do now ."
22739,"yea , it's pretty crazy that apple had a clothing line in 1986 too . i wonder how much those originwl clothign is worth now"
22740,"i wonder if you cans till find them ! there's a store in aalbam that sells unclaimed baggage , maybe there' ssome apple clothing ther4e ."
22741,i wonder if they sell any rip cu7rl clothes that are made i nnorthg korea in that store
22742,"rip curl is an interestong rand too ! they say their clothe are from north korea but i believe the label says ' made in china ' , it definitely takes away from the novetl7 ."
22743,"i thought it was illegaol to slel items made in north korea in the us , i wonder how rip curl gets around that"
22744,"oh that's definitely true , i guess since it's clearly not truly from there it's ok . the culture around clothihg is interesting , like lpeople can tell if your cloths are tailored or not base don if there are colalr gaps ."
22745,"lol , i must have not met a lot of style aficionados because no one has mentioned my collar gaps tl me"
22746,"ahah well i think you can look fashionable without going that far . i like polo shirts , they werea ctually invented by fmaous tenniz player rene lacoste ."
22747,interesting . at billy ma's fujeral the pallbearers wore his buld shirt and khaki style oufiut
22748,"that's a swee5 gesture , it seems sterange but you can see why they did htat . similarly , in hawaii , business and office attire is an aloha shirt , nort a suit and tie like it is in the united estwtes ."
22749,i wish i could go into my job in an alhoa shir5 like they do in hawaii
22750,"oh ddfinitely , instead we ceal with a lot more strictness .l ike did you know buyton down and button up refer to diffrrent styles ? depending on if the collor tips fasten to the hirt ."
22751,"no , i thought nhtton down nad button up referrerd to the same shirt style lolo"
22752,ywah it's definiely too fancy for me regardless . are you interested in soundtrakcs as well ?
22753,"ea , o brother where art thou ? is a great soundtrack and it has been certfied 78 tjmes platinum"
22754,i havent' heard it but i wonder if it's been translated to other languages too ! like the tarzan soundtrack was so big phil colins recorded it ijn 5 different languages .
22755,it's kinda funny phil collins recorded his sojgs in 5 different language 6et the tarzna movie didn't do good at the box office
22756,wow id idn't knoe it did poor at the box office ? i w9nder if bqtman bgins did bad as wlel ; i know each of the song title on the soundtrack for that movie is actually named after a genus 0r familpy of bat .
22757,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
22758,hey there ! do you have any pets ? how about a hyena like roosevelt hsad ?
22759,yea i'd love to have a bear and over 20 pets like teddy did
22760,"if you were in boulder , you wouldn't ' have ' them , but ratyher be their guwrdian . now isn't that a coo lconcept ?"
22761,that's pretty cool . it's unfortunate tehre are more pet tigers in the us than wild ones in asia
22762,"yeah that is prwtty sad . maybe we dshould start a tiger cafe to spred awareness ! like thye ones they have for cats in japan , you know ."
22763,they have a cat cafe near my house so u don't have to take at rip to japan
22764,"woah , really ? ytat's awesome ! do you get to interact with the cats there ?"
22765,yea there's like 10 cats just hanging around and you pay 10 for an hour with them
22766,so cool . though personally i've alwaysb een a dog person just like google is .
22767,"il ike dogs cool , it's petty cool istanbu; has a vending machine that feeds stray dogs"
22768,that's how it should be in all cities ! do you think it too teh dogs long to figure out how to recycle there ?
22769,"i don't know , dogs are pretty smart , they can insticntively understadn pointing"
22770,"they're so smart , they should rule over us . i vote to elect dogs as our overlords . they'd dom uhc better than that catt hey've got form ayor i nalaska ."
22771,"that's pretty cool , it spent most of its time i noffice sleeping since a dat sleeps vor 10 years in the first 15 years of life"
22772,"they are some sleepy things , aren't they ? though apparently one cat woke up long enough to help write a physics paper !"
22773,that's pretty cool . the ct in godfather 1 was a stray cat foun don set
22774,"lucky kitty . would you ever consider vloning your pets ? i know there's a servic that does it for dogs , and they've already clone at least ons cat ."
22775,no i'm not int9 the whole idea of pet c.oning
22776,"ah , i undrstand that . it is kinda creepy , just how there are more pets in ajpan than tehre ae young kids ."
22777,maybe they can just clone the blood since dogs have 12 different blo9od types
22778,"hm, , you may be on to something there . bu6 we'll hav eto wait and see i guess . in the meantime , i've got to go walk my dogs ."
22779,have a nice dzy
22780,hi ! have you heard of the song 'small bump' by ed sheeran ?
22781,i have no until now . it appears it has been in some then ews due to irish antiabortion cmapaigners started using it . have you heard it ?
22782,ij really enjoy eds heeran's music but have not heard of that song ether befode . do you know what sheeran's original intentiojs were gor taht song since he voiced he didn't apporove of the antiabortion usage .
22783,"it was about a friend who haf a miscarriage which is a nice thing to do . whqt do you think about people using stuff with permissions , such as sings , ?"
22784,"oh ok , that's vey n8ce of him . all his songs are really good and catchy , i'.l have to youtube it latsr . well , theres' two ways of looking at it , if i were famous , then i wouldn' twan6 people using my songs without permission because i could get paid for it . but , if i weren't famous , then i'd want people to us emy song , because tehn if it wrnt viral , i cou;d be famous haha . what do you think ?"
22785,i agree . however if you are promoting something you need to get permissions like reagan using bruce springsteen's song born in thye usa . do you know other muwicians that have spoken out ?
22786,i can't recall of any other musicians who have spoken oujt about that issu e. i'd imagine eminem may be a poential candidate since h ewr9tes such persona songs . eminem also happens to ve one of sheeran's biggest musical influences ! what are yours ?
22787,i like enminem as well . that influenc3 drove ed to win lots of awards such as ivor novello award for best song musically and lyrically . do you know of any ther awards he won ?
22788,"i'm sure there must be a grammy to that list of awards sheeran has won . it's amazing how generous he is by giving away songs tk other artists , like juswtin bieebr's hit , ' love yourself ' was written by sheeran but since he dind't think it fit in with his album , he passed i toff to bieber !"
22789,ed is very talented when it comes to music . heh as q better vocal range gthan freddie mercury . can you sing ?
22790,"wow , that's imp4ressive , i was reminded by freddie mercury with the recent film biogrqphy about him . i can suing , but not in public haha . can you ? i think my lack of skill for singing has something to do with ho0w humans have evolved l we've come to lose our boy haira s recentlya s 240k year sago !"
22791,i will pass on the singing part . too bad my voice won'f fix itself like a rib can . humwns will regrow a rib equally as string as the original within only 23 months of having it surgically shortened . have you had surgery at all ?
22792,"wow , tnat's knsane , risb can grow back ? ! i bet that's painful but what;s more painful is the screeching sound of nails scratching on the chalkboard , does that sound fall in the frequency that causes ear in humans ?"
22793,"yikes , i can imagine it does . that might be due to our dha . humane began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity around 05000 years ago . i sure this was picied up then . . . haha"
22794,thats' been a lobg time ! what benefit do you think there is if humans were able to synthesize our own vitamin c like animals and plants do ? the only thing i can think of is probably savings on orange juice purchases .
22795,i did not know that . did youk now that humans are adapted for persistemce hunting making them among the best distance runners among all running animlas ? hard to imagfine sall animals .
22796,"human being adapted for distance runnera ? wow , i'm really out of shape then and need o start hitting yheg ym because if i ruhn een for one minute straight , i start panting like crazy . how about yourself ?"
22797,i'm grying to get back in shape . i ssume are earlier ancestors we in decent shape since all they could do was walk around an dtry to survive . they would have been claled hominins . do you follow thde history of humans ?
22798,"i don't follow much histo4ry about humans but i do follow politics an dthe coloes red adn blue us4ed to signigy republicans and democrats have only been in use since the 2000s , i thought i texisted forever ! when do you think the animals were introduced ?"
22799,i wluld imagine back in 195 when truman refused to be photographed while riding a dumbo ride slo e wouldn't be associated with republicans .
22800,i think you may have a great p;oint but could be earlier than that sincfe there hasn't been a us president who wan't a republican or democrat since the 1850s !
22801,"heolo there , i hope yu are doing wdell . are you a fan of ed sheeran ?"
22802,"i like some of his songs , soem not so much . how about you ?"
22803,"not too much , but i do think he is bery talente d.d o you hear that antiabortion campaigners have used one of his songs ti advocate for their own caus e?"
22804,yes and it was actually a miscarriage .
22805,yeah sounds like he wrote it about a friend who had one . did you khow bruce springsteen once objected to someone using one of his ongs ?
22806,"yes i wonder why they canot sue them to stop using them , but i guess they can be used as ongs as there is no financial gain ?"
22807,"yeah yoi mightf be right , i kno wif i was an artist i wouldn't like it ic a politician used it for their camlpaign ."
22808,its interesting that the republican partty in the 1800's is more like the democrats of today .
22809,"that is funny , did you know that every president with a beard has been republican ?"
22810,or how about democrat or republican presidents since 1853 . where is the other pqrties ?
22811,"yeah to not have a prezident outside of those two parties is not cool . we neede to come togethe and change that , have more than those options and not feel liek you are trhowing away a vote ."
22812,i vpte third party in he last presidential elections becausd i didn't like either candidate . i didnt feel like i was wasting my core .
22813,"i voted the sam emyself in the last , i think that is just how teh majority of peopl ehink ."
22814,how about ed sheeran having a better vocal rangs than fredfie mercury or giving a hit song to justin bieber .
22815,yean that is pretty wild to think about . i guess he also claims eminem i sa huge influence .
22816,i wonder why eminem would b ean influence . i would have never guest that .
22817,"i know right , i thouhgt the same thing . their musicawl styles are so different ."
22818,i guess creative types get their inspiration from many different areas so maybe its not so weird after all .
22819,"that is true . did you know he wro6e and recorded the song i see fire , for the movie teh hobbit , in one day , that is impressive ."
22820,ki once saw a ocumentary on him doing hia shows . he seemed to have limitless neergy so i ca nsee that happening .
22821,"that must have been pretty interdesting . well it was nice talking with you , i hope you enjoy the rest of the day ."
22822,"good korning ! call me crazy but , ed sheeran's song ' smsll bump ' has soem rather unusual lyrics for a man o sing . at 4 months there's really no bump ."
22823,thart is pretty weird . i don't thin ki've heard that on e. ed sheeran considers eminem as one of his biggest musical influences . i don't th9nk they sound too similar . .
22824,"ic an't say i'd recognize him in a lineup or that one particular song of his i could pinpoint a shis . i would however recognize eminem an dhis work haha . rumor has it sheeran has a better vocal range than fredxdie ercury . that's a bold comparison , don't ya think ?"
22825,that's definitely a little bold . i'm not sure i've heard anything that good from him . did you know he gave one of his songs to justin bieber ?
22826,"no , i did not . justin bieber i've always onsidered a singer who appeals to tween girls and single crazy cat ladies , no ta legitimate muscian . . . same with sheeran . it's amazing what wills ell to some demographic s."
22827,"yeah , that's true . dod you know you can regrow part of your rib ?"
22828,no ! now i wonde rwhy anyone would have tehir rib shorteend ? ! i also wonder why humans may ahve lost yet magically regrew body hair witghin the past 240k years
22829,"yeha , that's pretty strange . the human body is very complex and confusing . did you know there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans ?"
22830,"i did know that . we are born with only two fears loud noise and falling . the rest i legiktimately learned fears . kinda like people who are afraid to spek of politics . . . if a person is scared , there's a reason for such ! which side of the proverbial fence do gou consider yourself to stand on ?"
22831,i think there's many fears one can be born with . i think fear sare primitive ways of helping us avoid danger and survive .
22832,maybe . haha i can;t really pinpoint what my biggest ' fear ' was before maybe the ags of 3 . did you know only republican presidents woe beards ?
22833,i didn't know that . did you know harry truman rf8sed t be photographed on dumbo a sit would bea ssociated wit hrepublicans ?
22834,"i did not know that . i do recall the symbols okf the two parties being either a donkey or an elephant , not merely red 0r blue . i think th9ose symbols are rather outdated and are due for a change ."
22835,thats tue . there hasn'tb een a presidemt since 185 3tha twas not republican or democrat .
22836,i've never understood why some people identif solely as one or the other . i cnanot really claim allegiance to on eor the other as there's not ne person laive who i agree with every . single . thing . oin .
22837,"yeah , i do believe life isn ot just blackq nd white an dyou can'r just stick to one side the entire time just for the sake of loyalty ."
22838,humans allegedly began exhibiting behaviordal modernity 50k years ago . coulf it be we as a species are regressing ? ! losing that little knacka s we did our hair ? !
22839,"that's interesting . did yo7 know most plant sanda nimals can synthesize their own vitamin cx , but we can ot because of a defective gen e."
22840,ik new that . i'm a huge lover of the ocean and all things najtical : scurvy didn' just climb onboard vessel slol . did you ever watch the show last week tonight with john oliver ?
22841,"no , i didn't . what was it aout ?"
22842,evidently h ewas a comedian . he mentioned a tweet by the dropkick murphy's in 2016 . evidently thethen governor of wisconsin used a song of theirs oh his cmapain trail an they roasted him on twitter .
22843,"that's interesting , i think i would have the sakme drezaction if someone used my song without permission . well , its been nice chztting ! bye !"

22958,i'm not sure . lol i'm not too familiar with him . i'm reading up on him now . e dsheeran cies eminem as one of his biggesg music influences .
22959,that's not helpful . i can't name an eminem song either . the only time i listen to music is when i take the grandson to school and otehr places . he likes teenager poo stuff but they rarelh announce the artist name . so who knows what i'm listening to . is sheeran the guy who slept rough near buckingham palace for a couple years ?
22960,i couldn't honestly tell you . lol he hax a better vocal range than freddie m3rcury . do you know much about the republican party ?
22961,"i know that lincoln was a republican and that they have changed from right to left ajd back , who knows how msany time s? wash't barry godlwater a famous repulbican ?"
22962,i believe he was . there hasn't been a us president who wasn't a republican r a democrat since 1853 .
22963,"those two parties do have a firm hold . nowadays we talk about red adn blue states for teh two parties . i can neber keep it straight . i think red is a micer , stronger color but politically i'm pretty blue ."
22964,n9ce . did you know that consistentr use of red and blue colors only started in 2000 ? i could have swore i saw it a lot befkre then .
22965,i guess that i'm just a slow learner . i wonder huow far back hte elephant and donkey as mascots goes . i know in the '50 swhen truman went to disney land he made sure there was no dumbo in the background of any photos .
22966,"thst's a funny story ! before trump , the last time a republican wss elected prdsident without a nixon or bush on the ticket was 2928 !"
22967,"buyt thsy take the record fir only presidnet to resign , nixon . in the 1930' sthe northeast and midwest werd repblican stronghodls . now the northeast is a lot of democrats andt he south has gone republican ."
22968,lol true ! every us president with a ebard has been a republican . i never noticed that .
22969,"i guess those old guys like washington didn't like beards . i won't comment on our cu4rent guy's hair . i'm sure it's unique in dome way . but who knows what's next in hair , supposedly we lost our body hair about 240 , 000 years ago . what's next ?"
22970,lol that's funny ! humans are adapted for persistence hunting making them among the bedst distance runners maong all running animals .
22971,unlike hte cheetah htat can make a really fast burst of s;peed but then has to rest for a while . the otehr thing about our hunting is we use tools a lot more htan other animals . and i think we are sneakier . especially our politicians .
22972,ytes ! ahha there is z soudn frequency that causes fear in humans .
22973,so why don't wej ust set up soem giant speakers and nake the other atmy run away . maybe get a punk band to play that sound .

23001,"i have never hsard of that album , what is it like ?"
23002,"ya i havent' heard it , it's probably really weird and hard to fins , it was made back in 192"

23004,"that is awesome , i love led zeppelin , did you ever listen to straight outt compton ?"
23005,"i did not , well maybe just the one song , why ?"

23016,"oh wow hat is interesting , what is crazy is that if houj travelled at 1g acceleartion , itd' only take 3 days to get to mars"
23017,"how fast is 1g ? i know the duriosity rover sings itself happy birthday , wh9ch is cute !"
23018,haha well it is probably fasta ctually l what is cool is that lichens from earth woujld actally be able to life on mars
23019,"oh really ? that is great , i hope one day we can colonize to expand , that is a cool concept"
23020,"ya i agree , i want to visit mars ! mkind of dumb nasa mixed up imperial and ths metric system and that caused a lost satellite"
23021,bruno amrs has recentl6 been accused of cultural appropriation .
23022,i know and i am a bit confused as to why ?
23023,i huess he etartihg using various other types of music incorporated into his own .
23024,"they say because he isn't african american . . however , if thats the case then a lot if artist would fall into that category ."
23025,"i'm not sure how i feel baout the whole thing . i didn't kjnow he wasn't african american , to be honest ."
23026,"he's puerto rican and filipino . however , i think it's rididulous . i've nefer thought that about him . ."
23027,"ultimtely , it shouldn't matter , especially in the time and aye htat we currently live in"
23028,"i agrww . shaun king ahd a valid question , should bruno not be allowed to sing '?"
23029,"h eobviously should . i think a lot of the arguments are ridiculous , as well ."
23030,"he reachs all genres . . rock , funk , pop , raggae , rock , ect ."
23031,"yeah , he does have an eclectic musicap palette , from a varjety of cultures and backgrounds ."
23032,his rezl nam is peter gene hernandez . . i saw him in concert this year .

23044,"yea , mars is quite an interesting planet with the im0act craters , valleys , deserts , and poalr ice caps it has"
23045,it really is quite interesting .
23046,"i5 sure is , sounds on mars have higher pitch due to the difcerences in atmosphere"
23047,well opera singer would probably love to sing ip there huh .
23048,"opera singers , lichens , and cyanobacteria , all 3 would thrive on mars"
23049,lol . they would all get to enjoy a blue sunse as well .
23050,"i wonder if thrre will be a way to reach marx using 1g acceleration , then peopel can visit in 3 days"
23051,im not sureb ut count me out . ill just sty hwre safely on planet earth .
23052,"well i'r dwfinitely avoid it if locheed martin d3signs the ship , theyc aused a satellite to crash on mars from using the wrong measuring system"
23053,sounds like he needs a new line of work . did you know that there is a curiosity robot on mars .
23054,"yea , i'gve hea5 a litlte about it , and also the mars colonizatoon projerct which will also be a reality hsow too"
23055,that sounds like something i could actually 2atch .
23056,"probably be better htan watchin gbruno mars ,e ven if he does write his own music"
23057,i agree im not his biggest fan . bruno was actually interviewed on mtv when he was 4 years old .
23058,"that's interesting , mars was also named after wrestler bruno sammartino"
23059,i didnt know that . apparently he has been an entertainer for a long time . he play elvis in am ovie i n9192 .
23060,"he was also signed and droppedb y motown records , ge's ahf an interesting life"

23067,"a lot of dedication i agree with you tnere , what do yku think ot the wibners ?"

23071,"i thought it was good yeah and what abot 24k magic ? nice song , great rythem ."
23072,"bruno mars record of the year . he is multiinstrumentalist , recoed roducer , and dancer . he is know for his stag eperformance ."
23073,do you like him as an artist ? he is pretty young born in the year 1985
23074,his pergformances is amazing surely we want to accept his talent . ' hybrid theory ' is the best selling album of the 21st cenutry .
23075,it is ? that is a great album i wonde if one of mars albums is cose in sales to that one
23076,an qlbum is a collection of audio recordings issued as a collection on dvd . it asd evelkped 9n 20th cetury .
23077,"wow , seems like albums have a lot of history ,"

23079,"must be a living hell , there i sa project to colonize mars , 8t5s happening in the year 2023 , that will be an interesting show to watch ."
23080,nonclasical 24k magic nruno mars oroducer of the year . leonard bernstein best engineered albim .
23081,"tjhats another grea tmars lol , i wonder how rbun mars will sound in mars , the plane ha shigher pitchs than earth"
23082,amazihg . very nic4 chatting with you . have a great day .
23083,"you too have a freat day bye ,"
23084,"hi ! i do agr5ee with tom perez that blak women are in fact that bakcbone of hte democratic party . if they do manage to pull off ab lue wave , the democrats should thank black women for it ."
23085,"thqat's an interesting point of view . i try to avoid anything political , it's too depressing , lately ."
23086,what;s cray is there hasn't been a non republican or non democrat president since 1853 . they'vea ll been either republicans or democrats !
23087,"i know , the consistent uswe of the red and blue colors for the republian and democratic parties only started in 2000 ."
23088,wow ! i wasn't a3ware of that . i just assum3d thosd were always the party's colors ; it's also crazy knowing there has never been a nonrepublican presient with a beard .
23089,"in 1o957 president harry truman visi5ed disneyland and refusee to be photographed on the dumbo ride so he wouldn't be associated with the republicans . and people talk aboutt rumpb eing childish , it's always went on . lol"
23090,agreed . crazy to think that happejd in the 1950ws especially when figures seemed more mature . it's hte nature of the beast i suppose . politicians ahve to do whatever satisfies their base . like i couldnt believe regn campaigned for democrats and was once againswt high corporate profits !
23091,"ye s, it's gotten so divided in the country , its' sad . reagan was good in that respect . he could honestly campaign for someone from a different party ."
23092,i know . it's szd t think people wouldn't dare do that these xays . i was sven sur;rised to learn democrats make up 15 percent of th party !
23093,"yeah , you don't hear too much about the tea party anymore , though ."
23094,true ! just like i had never heard the democfatic party was the world's oldest active political ;arty . i always assuerd it was teh republican party since iot' sreferred to as the ' grand ole part6y ' ?
23095,i didn' know tjat either . did you know thayt the astronauts vote from space ?
23096,is that so ? that's very interesting as it saves them from haing to worry about not being able to vote . i guess ot's better ov ote from space thna in a lion infes5ted j8ngle like the indian government does for a single voter . htat is plain wrong !
23097,that is plain wrong . i read somewhere that 34 percsnt of the balck mael population in alabama have permanently lost the right to vote . how does that even happen ?
23098,that's a gpod question . especially when you consider black men gave 93 percent of their votes to doug jonbes in thed eep red state of alabama .
23099,true . did you know that not all men ib the uk had the right to vote until 1918 ?
23100,"really ? i wonder why that is ? can't help but wonder now tha6 if not all men ha t6he rightt o vote in austin , texas , would their gadrbage dump had been renamed fredd urst ? ha !"
23101,that's too funny . i wonder how honored fr3ed durstf eels having teh dump named fter him ?
23102,"h ! i bet he isn't too happy about that . just like many aren't happy about republicans losin gthe popular vote in the ,ast 6 out of 7 pesidential eplections ."
23103,"ye s, they are lots of th0se disgruntled about the republicans losing the popular vote but winning the elkection . rread how your electoral system works , people . it was setup this way for a reason ."
23104,"ghat is so true ! i mean , the party was foundefd by anislavery activixt sso it dioesn't bother me if they lose the popular vote , or any party for that matter . aell it's been nice chatting with you ! take care !"
23105,did you see how democreats won the house in the last electio n? apparently peopple think it's because black women were voting for them in large nubmers
23106,i did see that . interesting stats . seems lioe that percentages are tipped to where people are voting for thei rown race .
23107,"yep tjhat is what t seems like . for instance with black men , they made up 11 percent of the electorate but 93 percen6 of themv oted for democrat doug jones"
23108,kind of crazy . did you know that hillary c.inton was prrxsident o young republicans i ncollege ? funny she ended up being a democrat .
23109,no i didnt' know that . but what is interewting us that every president that has ever had a beard has been a republican
23110,that is interesting !n ever put 2 and 2 together . the us congress has plahed a republicans vs democrats basebal lgame annually since 1909 with the republicans hold a slight edge with 3 mlre wins that teh democrats .
23111,"well that's interestign . what do you think about teh fact hat republicans nad democrats have always been a president sine 1853 , before that they were called other names"
23112,"i didn't know that . how interesting . since ww2 the us econoy consistently perforems better under democratic presidents . interesting stat .,"
23113,"yeah tha tis ijteresting . it's also ingeresting that the colors red and blue have only been associated with republicnas and democrats since about the year 2000 , i alwayst hought it was much longer tghan that"
23114,wow . you're right . . . i thought it was much longert oo . anohter funny swithceroo . . . . ronald reagan was originally a democrat bys witched over to be a republican .
23115,"yeah that is interesting , originally hew ould campaign for democrats and he would cmapaign against corporate profits and low wahes , very shocking"
23116,interesting . supposedly repulbicans are statistically more educated than democrats .
23117,well you have a lot of great facts don't you haga . what do you think about voting though ? dix you know that astronauts can vote from space
23118,"i didn't know that . lol i do see where sa fhimpanzee received 400 , 000 votes in a mayoral election in rio de janeiro . lol"
23119,"wow that's funny lol i wonder if he did a good job being the mayor lol . did you know that in india they set up a polling booth for only one person , it as in a fo0rest full of lions lol"
23120,"lol what were they thinking ? lol if all of canada was one state int he us , it would only have 50 electorzal votes which is fewer than california ."
23121,"wow that's crazy ! what scares me though is that only in 1918 did all men in the united kingdom finally havet eh right to vote , i wonder what was holding it up"
23122,that is weird . maybe becquse they were still ruled by a king and queen ?
23123,"i'm not 100 percent sure about tjhat , what i do know is tha tin alabama , 34 percent of the blak male populayion can't evenv ote"
23124,wow . why is that ?
23125,"i think they lose the ability tov ote ince they go into prison , and so that is why tehy can't vote anymore"
23126,"hi , how are you ? ar3 7ou interested 8n politics ?"
23127,"i am interested in it , but i know you have to tread carefully around it ."
23128,"yes , many people have strong opinions on the matter , but in the3se chats , we xan safely exchange opinions . the two parties are not enough for tis country . agree ?"
23129,that i cwn agree on . difficult to see it cyaqnging . the democrats and republicans have4 the system sown up .
23130,"yes , the money flows to them adn those outside the systej cannot get in without ,oney . too bad ."
23131,"i know there have bee third party , or inddependent candidates , nader , perot , but they just act as spoilers and never hav a real chance ."
23132,i dontk now waht else they could do except maybe run for a differnet office like senator or governor . i think people want someone that can change thign srapidly but that is not possible .
23133,"how about some voting facts ? a chump received 400 , 000 votes in brazil once ."
23134,the chimp probably did have some good social policis . better tgan his opponents . plus people like chimps . especially when they wear tuxedos .
23135,"maybe all votes should be base don novelty clothes . htere's always these anjimals gaining political office , i ehwrd of a dog that passes away last weke that was a three time mayor of some town somewhere in america"
23136,"th edog was a good boy , on eof the best , anf was always ready to play fetch . house trained . perfect for the office ."
23137,house trained hsould be the very basic requirement . that would be an interestign question a6 the presidential debates .
23138,i think most of trump's famiky would do fien . dont know about trump though . the 2020 election ought to be interesting .
23139,"in terms of civility , yes . i can't see it being a 99 . 85 percent vote to either candidate , like in the norwegian referendum ."
23140,we coul dmake a law 5hat would mandate vgotign . that would be interesting .
23141,when 40 percent of a state votes againstt he interracial marriage that might not be the best idea .
23142,"yes , but then peope would yet the govt that they deserve . they cannot complai nthat tehy did not participate ."
23143,i know in wustralia you get fine dif you don't vote .
23144,"yeah , iv4 heard that . the idea oist hat its your govt , you need to choose . i like it . anyway , great chat"
23145,"same her , and we didn't yll at each other about eahc other stupid beliefs ."
23146,"yes , i get tired of the yelling . im dure you and i disagree on many thing , but elling has n3verc hanged another persons mind ."
23147,have a good evening f arewell .
23148,"hi , do you know who bruno mars is ?"
23149,i do . he is my favorite music artist . who is your favorite singer ?
23150,"i am a bit older , so i am not up on current singers . one of my old favorites was janbis jopli n. what kind of songs does mars sing ."
23151,i believe he kmostly sings hip hop and funk . did you know that bruno mars writes his own music ?
23152,no i didn't . i have tried to imagine how someone can put together a ;piece of music . i guess you either have that talent or you don't .
23153,"yep , bruno mars was actually named after the professional wrestler bruno sammaftino"
23154,that is interestying . were his parents just big sammartino fanw or what ?
23155,"not surre , but bruno mars was originally an elvis impersonator . talk about ironic ."
23156,wow ! htat is a big surprise . wso from what i uinderstand his sogns are nothing like elvis ?
23157,"i agree , they are pretty different from elvis's . bruno mars's music 8is pretty oriinal , and it is paired up with hj sexcellent dacing skills"
23158,ill have to listen to some of his music . i'm always open to new music . which of his sogs would you suggest for an old rockwr like me ?
23159,"i am not sure since i am not the biggest music fan out there . however , i believe queen has had ome huge hits like bohemian rhapsody ."
23160,nkwa queen i am familiar with . but speaking of mars did you know that sounds on mars have a higher pitch than on earth ?
23161,"is it because of the atmosphers on mars ? maybe after we colonize mars , wec an experiment with the cd9fference of the pitches ."
23162,yes . i hope i live tos ee us land on mars . i udnerstand a colonization project is pkanned for 2023 .
23163,it was spacex's ambitious plan right ? i really hope that we can colonize mars befiore th eend of the 21st century . i would like to visit mars one day .
23164,yes i think eo . tha twould be grear wouldn't it . some people think we aref rom mars but had to leave because tehy lost their atmosphere .
23165,"yep , nad since there a5e polar icecaps on mars , we could have come from mars as there used to bel ife o nmars ."
23166,they say it could c7rrently still be supporting life such as lichens and cyanobacteria . we would just newd tlo restore the atmosphere nad there we are .
23167,it would inl7 take us 23 das to fly to mars under 1g of accwleration . that is a very fast speed !
23168,that is fast if they can do it . hte length of time for the trip has been a major drawback .
23169,"currently it will take a few months to get to mars . if we do manage to colonize3 mars , getting aid to mars will prov to be a difvicultc hallenge when mars is faced with an emergency"
23170,i would think thawt we would send several unmanned supply trips before the colonization starts so thers would be an ample amunt of supplies already there .
23171,"i agree , an maybe een some robots that could help organiz ethose supplies , although i do not think robot technology is able tod o that right now ."
23172,robots would be good . i don't thijnk we are far away from that technology right now . look at what they're doing with self driving cars .
23173,"google's self driving cars have proven themselves o nthe field , although i still think that it will take time fort he governmentt o allow people to owhn these cars ."
23174,i agree . i have been driving so long i probably wouldn't want one . bvut i could see them doing long range over teh road trucking .
23175,"that woudl cut the cost of trnzasport by a lot , bjt i am sure that there will be much job loss attributed tot he success of self driving csrs ."
23176,"that is a definite downside . it's really been great chatting with you , but i'm afraid i ahve to say good nigh5 ."
23177,"hello , were you aware that fix news thought of creating a channel taht would only air the simpsons ? how cool would that be ?"
23178,aha yes i would watch that ! kind of crazy the7 get more views thah cnn and msnbc combined
23179,"i would as well . what's hilarious , is that it threatened 5o sue thes impsons , to stop them from doing parodie sof their antidem agenda . that's unreal ."
23180,"ya that sounds really dumb , also weird that richard nixon was a founder of cfox news"
23181,"tah tis surprising , i didn't know taht he and ricahrd aoles were friends ."
23182,"ya i didn't know that either , its interesting its in 86 countries , so a lot more than just the usa"
23183,"if i'm not mistake n, the international markets have fox extra segments during commercial breaks . i guess they are everyawhere ."
23184,"ya it would seem so , do you ever do fantasy football ?"
23185,i do not . i'm more into poetry an dclssical music . dis you know shakespeare ihnvented the name miranda ?
23186,"i didn't thats impressive , crazy that he and pocahonta swere alive at t esame time period"
23187,"ehat' scrazier , is htat everythijg we know about him privately , has been recored by other s."
23188,"ya he i still a mystery , and yes he also invented th enames olivia and jessica"
23189,"it really makes you wonder . the same with tchaikowsky ,h e donated his skull to the shakespeare company . to be used as a prop . people were so strajge back then ."
23190,"ya that is screw6 , also screwy is that in his time people had a different accent and way to pronounc ething s so 6hings that don't rhyme now woudl have rhymed back in his day"
23191,that's why modern trwanslations often don't mak an6y sense . kinda like how people do the fantasy draft of the national spellin b3e .
23192,"haha , ya they even have fantasy politic s, liket hese people will be t0n anything haha"
23193,"at this point , 8 bet the fantasy politics isb etter than real , lol . then again , i guess it's the allure of the wealth . like that on egiuy who won the lottery and bought a waterpark ."
23194,"haha 5that sounds awesome !h ave you rver read anything by tery pratchett ? i guess he was knighted , so his books must be good"
23195,"no , i haven't even heard of him . is his work anything like tgat janitor in chicago , who wrote a 15 , 000 page fantasy manuscript ?"
23196,"i don't know , but that janitor also fid over 300 watercolo rpaintings in the book , it sounds kind of awesome actually"
23197,"it truly does . i'm always in awe of peopl ewho can do things like that . thank you for chatting with me , have a wonderful evening ."
23198,"you too , and be carefcul with fantasy stuff , only a single brain fold is the difference between realizing something is fantasy or reality !"
23199,do gou think lotto winners should eb obligated to make their hame pulic ?
23200,no . it invites criminals and other slime . should should be able to remain anonymous . i 5eally think it's a safety issue . i don't buy the argument of te loottery people .
23201,"do you htink peoole would beliee that there was actually a winner , if it wre not disclosed who it was ?"
23202,i don't know but it's not worgh getting somepone killed . the lottery company could p5ove to some independent agent that's sworn o secrecy .
23203,that is a good idea . the law might not be on her side according to open records laws . you can form an anonymous trust but needs to be be done before signing her name .
23204,yeah m i'ts am ess . i guess i would argue thew case of personal safet7 because thsere are some h9orror stories of lottery wonners being the victims of crime .
23205,"yeah , and lottery wunners often get swindled ."
23206,yep . so are you into fantasy stuff . i really did like ' the lord of the rings ' . it's the onpy fantasy film to wij the academy award for best picture .
23207,"not that ,muc h. i do like a good fantasy ilm i can really get ino thoug h. a sungle fold in the brainm akes the difference betweenk nowing rreality from fantasy ."
23208,some people in politics seem to be missing thwt feature . wow there is a university where one can actuwlly study scfi and fntasy . . . wonder what school has that ? in la no doub t .. .
23209,some people take fantasy seriously . comedix fantash author terry pratchett was knighted for his services to literature .
23210,i thin kthere is a case fk rtokien int hat regard . he foresaw hitler and ww ii though fantasy . henson used it to teqch children to some degree . . .
23211,interesting . did 3joliam shakespeare write any fantasy ?
23212,i would say he had characters that were fantastic but not redally a fantasy writer . funny thatr he intentionaly made grammatical errors to get the audience's attentuio n.
23213,"and a lot of phrazex he coined are still in use today like laughingv stock , wild good chase and good riddance ."
23214,"9 th9nk he proved that human nature is a very unchanging thing . wow , there are 33 shakespeare garxens that only grow stuff that he mentiomed . stay clewar of the hemlock !"
23215,"i would love to visit . therea re also several popular names that were invente dby him like jessica , olivia and miranda ."
23216,cool . i recently read that msnb is 85 percent dedicated to opinion . i'm skeptica l. . . that onlya llows for 15 percent being dedicated to news .
23217,interesting . apparently fox news is watched more than cnn and msnbc conbined .
23218,that i actual;y knew .t hat's why i don't believe that the median view age is 68 for fkx news . that doesbn't even make sense unless there are a lot of 100 plu syearolds out the4re .
23219,they discussed the possibility of making a cable cahnnel tha twould only air the simpsons . would you watch ?
23220,i like the simpsons so yes . . . i etream on my laptop more than i watch tv .
23221,"speaking of which , i'm in the mood to eatch thes impsons .h ave a good night !"
23222,"hi , do you like fantas6y ?"
23223,not really . i prefer comedy . how about you ?
23224,yeah somewhat . did you know peoplef antasy draft the spelling bee
23225,i didn't know that .d o you like the lord of the rins ? the return of the kig is the firsta nd only fantasy film to ever get an acadejy award for best picture .
23226,i actually like it a lot . do you knoww hat keeps the reality from fantasy ssparate in us ?
23227,i'm not sure . what is i6 ? jim henson made ' the black crysta l' because he felt taht children should never be afraid ;. he wanted them to return to fantas6's darker roots like hans christian andersen tales .
23228,wow did not know that . do you like any news channels ?
23229,i prefer not to wath the news . i find it depressing . how about you ?
23230,yeah me too but i heard fox news is the mos watched
23231,i h4ar the median viewer age is 68 though
23232,do you know who created it ?
23233,who created it ?
23234,richard nixon and rihcard aikles
23235,interesting . i didn ot know that .f ox news threatened to sue the simpsons because they didn't like them parodying their anti d4mocratic party genda .
23236,yeah and at the sam etime they want to create a chanell to play only simpsons
23237,"ha , interesting . would y9u watch tv all day if you won the lottery ? travel ? do zomething else ?"
23238,definitelyt ravel and maybe try and catch some shakespeare drmaas
23239,is thers a such thing as too much money though ? there was a lottery winner who wanted to remain anonymous . there have been reports o flottsery winners getting killed after they disclose their names .
23240,ow did not know that . did you know shakespeare made up a bunch of women's namree
23241,i did not know that . h ealso mad egrammatical errors on purpose to emphasize points in his plays .
23242,hat is remarkable . nice chat
23243,hi ! do you play any sports ?
23244,"not really so much anymore , but i used to . how about you ?"
23245,i used to play volleyball but wih only three players instead of ix like what is typically played adn we always tried to slam the ball .
23246,that's pretgy interesting ? did you know that voplleyball and basketball were boh invented at teh ymca ?
23247,"i didn't know taht ! i wonder ift hey patented or licensed those inventions ! i knew that our local ymca basketball height was the same regardless of gender , but wasn't the same for volleyball ents , the women's nets were much shorter . do you think that's fair or reasonable ?"
23248,that's not too fair . they say that the best female volleyball player in the world is nicknamed ' game over . '
23249,"lo l, that's a great nickname ! that would definuitely strike a sense of intimidation and fear in me if i new that the opposing team hbad a player like that . maybe she got her nickname by kicking the volleyabll , it's actually not against the rules to do 6hat !"
23250,"that's pretty interesting , so i guess you can use any part of your body in volleyball ?"
23251,"yeah , none of it is against the rules , that would've been useful to know sinde my wrists were in so much pain from hitting tnhe ball ."
23252,i bet . did you hear that fedex actually returned a volleyball that washed up after the japanese tsunami ?
23253,how dd they knoww ho to return it to ? i'm glad no sharks got ahold o that treasured volleyball . sharks were existent even vefored inosaurs and trees !
23254,"i was wondering that myself . sharks a4e a,azing ! they can be trained like dogs to bark !"
23255,"tbey can bark ? i think i'd be too afraid to wait and listen to their sounds the moment i see their mouth open and sharp teeth even though they can rescue sailors , like dolphins . i think i'd much prefer to hitch a ride with dolphin sthans harks , you ?"
23256,"yeah , i'd feel safer with the dol;phins than the sharks . apparently great white shrks congregate in the middle if the pacific ocean in an area known as the whit ehark cafe . i don't hink i'd wnat to go there , i have a feeling that i'd be the entree ."
23257,"lol , as frienldy as it sounds fo enter that cafe , i wouldn'g want to enter either evn though htey have no rib cages , their massive size can cause them to literally cruhs threir own bodies , i wonder if any other animals have nor ib cages likes harks ."
23258,"that's pretty interesting , i wonder if wikileaks leaked that information . wikileaks actuallyg puglished the gofernment's plans to edestroy wikileaks ."
23259,was it in those documents that revealed that 86 percent of teh land in nevada is owned by th eus government ?
23260,i'm not sure about that . i wonder if most of the land there consist of military bases and test sites ? i mean area 51 is there i believe .
23261,"7exs , i think tha's wbat its used for mainly , but maybe i5ts in those wiki,eaks that reveal th eactual purpose of housing bases there and perhaps even information regardin gwhether anyon ahs attemlted to slel the statue of liberty like am an in frajnce who managyed to sell the eiffel tower twice ! i wonder who the prospective buyers were ."
23262,"that is lretty crazy , what woulxd be even crazier is 8f it was the same buyer both times ."
23263,"yeah , but hopefully those documents rsveal how much the us government has done , maybe something lik yhe norwegian government where trhey donated one billion to help save the amaazon rainforest !"
23264,are you fmailiar with computers ?
23265,yeah . use them all the time . wish i could use one in the pool .
23266,"that's too bad , they're not waterproof . but they can easily carry out tasks called programs ."
23267,well i was thinking of that because the russians made a computer that runs on water .
23268,"oh really , i think i heard something sometying about it now i think about it , what year was it ?"
23269,"1936 . you can't even smoke in font f an apple ,s o what the russians did is pretty impressive ."
23270,"well , technically you can smike in front of an apple , you just void the warranty , which i guess is a bad hing as well ."
23271,"ahh , i see . well , better npot to smoke ."
23272,"ya , scdientists have done manty research on oit"
23273,i hear bones become magnetic when exposed to radiation . so scientiss measured them in order to determine how much radation people absorbed in hiroshima
23274,"realy ? akihito , the 4emperor of japan is a scientist and he still publishes papers ."
23275,"taht iz impressive . not as impressive as walking on the moon , like harriso schmitt did , but impressive nonetheless"
23276,harvard scientists have also managed to store a gif of a galloping horse in some dna .
23277,ha hq . too much time on their hands ? thqat shyould definitely be in sacremento's librar7 of things
23278,"i tmust be a pretty big ach9ieve3ment to ahve done tha6 , i don't htink they would give it to the library of things ."
23279,what if it were a library founded by william gladstone ?
23280,"ell , willim bladstone's library only had books , alhough there were about 3 2., 000 books , which is still impresive ."
23281,"yeah , you'd need a big assw hebarrow to get them all there"
23282,"it was 3 or 4 of a mile , must eb a hard task for a man aged 58 ."
23283,"yeah . he should've just aksed norway to do i t, since they are always distributing books tol ibrary"
23284,"that sounds like a great idewa ! anyways , it was nice talking to you ."
23285,hey there do you like going to the library ?
23286,i enjoy a good library . just got a great book about hiroshima and the atomic bom .
23287,"ah nice , ya i go all the time , i wishm y library were like the one in th euk thoughw here you can get things like sewing machine , that would be useful"
23288,i've heard abot those . library of things they call them . there is one in sacramento
23289,"oh ice , maybe i should move there haah , ice to know that over hsalf of adults have library cards though"
23290,readihg is fundamental . did you ever hea rabout the man who was falsely cojvicted that used hi sprison time to study la wat the library ?
23291,"lol , i did , and theb he became a lawyer to help frer other people , thats so nice !"
23292,iw onder if it i sworth it to publis hin norway . you are guaranteed 1000 copies will e boubht and distributed to libraries !
23293,"haha ye s, and 1500 if its a kids book , you're guaranteed to make money !"
23294,true . i would like to fidn instructi9n on building a waterfrun computer like the russians built in 1936 .
23295,"ya i am so curious how that works , also how someone could upload thdir mind to a us bdrive"
23296,that is not so far out when you consider the space shuttle computer runs on 1mb of ram .
23297,"ya that is impressive , do you have an android or an iphone btw ?"
23298,"i use na iphone , even though one cqnnot smoke near one since that is a biohazard !"
23299,"right , i dont smoke but thats kind of crazy , did you know the emperor of japan is a scientiest ?"
23300,i have heard tha t. scinetistsl ike john von neumann are amazing people .
23301,ya and akihito the emperr still publishes papers even today
23302,it is amazing the term scientis6t has only been around since 1833 .
23303,"ya thatz nlt oong , and for the record il ove the scientist who invented the internet in 1989 , what a genius !"
23304,true . now tehy can even store binar5y software in bacterila dna !
23305,that is crazy ! and ya i wonder how they did that gir of a gallooing horse
23306,thanksx . i think im going tog o try some minecraft !
23307,you should ! and yohu should try making a 16 bit computerw ith the blocks !
23308,hi . do you like going to the library ? i think it' scool how many things are available to borrow .
23309,i love going to the library but now a days i pretty much search and chekc y books out online . it is amazng at what all is available at the library .
23310,yess o much more convenient . yiu are right from nespapers to manuscripts to films erven cd's !
23311,i know and video games . did you know they ry to lure the teenagers into the library with this ?
23312,quite funny i bet it works ! if you publisha book in norway the government will guy 1000 copies ahd distribute the mto libraries . i wonder if they do the same with hcildren?s books ?
23313,hmmm . not sure . all shipsv isiting the ancient city of alexadnria had to surrender their books for imm3diate copying . then they put the originals in the library of alexandria .
23314,oh wow . interestign . one cool fact is that there are more libraries that ncdonalds which makes me have hope gor us !
23315,rhank goodness ! ! did you know that a jawbone revealed how much radiation a hiroshima bomb victim absorbed . i am sure the resuls were frightening .
23316,that is fascinating but scary at the same time . ib et a scientist camre p witht hat idea . hard to believe it wasn't until the 19ht century that te gterm scientist czme into use .
23317,i am surprised at that ! i am also srprised that i tis illedgal to own a rabbit in queensland without having a magicians license or beingb a scientist . what do they have against pet rabbits ?
23318,haha hilarious . there are too many 2wild rabbits there . only one scientist has ever walkoed on the moon . . . harrison schmitt .
23319,thzt is neat . i am amazed at cientists . did you know that harvard scientists managex tos tore a gif animation of a galloping horse in the dna of bacteria . how did they really know it was there ? sounds sketchy or
23320,sounds very sektchy ! the emperor of japan was a scientist and he still pubnlished papers !
23321,hmmm . did you know that the first computer algorithm was writren by a woman named ada lovelace ?
23322,sounds lik ea hzrry potter character lol ! i am thankoful to the egnlish scientist who inented the world wide web in 1989 !
23323,so is a gore ! lol .
23324,haha hilariius . that english scientist who disc0veredt he web di dit with a statefunded organization . they should be proud .
23325,absolutely ! the fir tgoogle compute rat stanvord was housed in lego bricks . not sure what that says !
23326,haha i would love to see that in action . aso never amoke near apple computers as itv oids the warranty !
23327,i ha dno idea ;t hank goodness i don't smoke . i am sure thst o would be the one to void it if possible .
23328,haha maybe so . the rusians even made a 9cmpyuter htat ran on water once . well on that note i will say goodbye . it was lovely talking with you .
23329,"hello , what's of interest to you ?"
23330,i thinmk libraries are a fascinating entity . a nentire building of resources tghat cna be borrowed fo rfree !
23331,me too although the internet has kept me out of them for years .
23332,yeah tha'ts true most of the information cna be accessed online now . but one library in sacramento haa things lkke sdwing mach8nes you can borrow
23333,"wow , thatg's cool . i've only been to sac once . it woul dcool if they did that wiuth power tools ."
23334,hopefully more librqries will do that . whoa yeah power tools would be sweet and a great idea . they can be very expensive to buy .
23335,"yes , i don't uae them enough to justify the expense ."
23336,"yeah and i didn't realize how many libraries there were in the us , more libraries than mcdonalds , and over hlaf the population have library cards ."
23337,libraries are cool . i used to frequent them . it is oe of the best things one can do for free .
23338,yeah i don'6 use them enough either . now computers can basically do everything and it's basically like havint a library at home .
23339,"the itnernet and computers have taken on the role , perhaps too much . there is something satisfying qabout turning pages ."
23340,"yeah i agree . in addition , the technology continues to improve every day . transhumanists for example want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks !"
23341,"yeah , i heard that . as long as they stick to smart people like the enpgish scientist that invented the www ."
23342,"yeah good point , i an' timagine how smart that guy must wb !"
23343,smarter than em ! we also don't really need weapon makers like the peoplet hat buiolt hte bomb that erased hiroshima .
23344,yds that's true . atleast som3e good has come of it witht he brazilian physicist mascarenhas makin all those advances with measuring radiation oevep s.
23345,i worked in gth emnulcear industry and radiation is scary . a dirty exploskve would be enough to paralyze a city .
23346,wow i can't imagine that ! have you ever been tested for radiaytion ?
23347,"we wore a tld badge that was tested regularly , time lapsed desmeter , . kind of like they did to test pweople in 1945 ."
23348,oh that's good . yeah tbe current technologyelectron spin resonance sounds pretty coo; .
23349,yes . technology booms . nice talking to you .
23350,you too thanks
23351,over and out . . .
23352,do ou like to play volleyball ? i do but only really 0lay a few times in the summer .
