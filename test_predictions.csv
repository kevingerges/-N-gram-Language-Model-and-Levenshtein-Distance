0,did you know that the university of iowa 's locker room is painted pink ? i wonder why ?
1,i think i did hear something about that . i imagine it is an attempt to psych the other team out .
2,"so , it woul be i nthe visiting team ' locker room but not their own ?"
3,right . teams do all kinds of things t bother the competition . 've heard of teams having seated bench in the winter fo themselves but nyt for teh visitors .
4,i would hate a cold bench . then again l i would n't want to be some place that cold or watching football .
5,i 'd rather watch it inside where it 's warm . ave you heard about teh georgia techcumberland game of 1916 ?
6,"no , what ha ; opened in that game ?"
7,"georgia tech defeated cumberland but here 's the thing , they defeated them by a score of 2220 !"
8,that is insane . how could that even happen ?
9,i do n't know but it did . it 's the highest scoring game in history .
10,i 'm sure . i do n't even watch much and i could n't imagine that record . i wonder if it people left or were they curious to see how it hit would go ?
11,"i guess it depended on what team you get pulling for . to be , it 's surprising that the highest scoring game was in college football and not professional ."
12,maybe it is because some are not as good in college so they may eb playing against someone not on their leave ; .
13,good point . professional does have a player that has never dumb ; ed the ball .
14,i 've heard that . was n't it a patriot player ?
15,it was . it was a running back by the name of benjarvus green ellis .
16,that i san interesting name . it 's like he ahs a lot of names .
17,i guess so . do you watch espn ?
18,no . id o n't have regular cable . i use a roku and i think you woulda ave took pay extra fo espn . i did n't watch it when i did have cable though .
19,"oh , i was going tot all you about the winning an emmy but hat 's okay . well , do you watch or hve you attached pokemon ?"
20,"do , i have n't watch pokemon . my sons use to play with the when they were little . now they use their phones looking or pokemon in the neighborhood . it is funny ."
21,"that is funny . pokemon is pretty popular adn has few for a while now they have over 750 tv episodes alone . well , i have to go no a it 's been nice chatting with you ! hav a great day !"
22,what do you think about keith jacksons death ?
23,it 's sad . i wonder how many peopel grew up hearing his voice ?
24,"i imagined is number in the millions taking into account he had a 54 year broadcasting carreer , so sad , but he was old ."
25,"i like that he used this phrase alot whoa , nellie !"
26,"that was a good phrase i liked it as well , did you see the beer commercial , the one in which he used this phrase ?"
27,i did n't . id i see the abc would not let him retire at 70 !
28,"yeah i think he ended his carreer in 2006 , he got lured and decided to stay , he had a great voice ."
29,he was also a marine . looks like he had even calling games since he was young .
30,"wow this guy sure is full with suprise s , he didnt only call footballs lakes but also pro basketball games as well as other sports ."
31,crazy busy it seems . he did n't say anything when woody hayes punched a clemson player either !
32,"yeah i heard he was criticized because of this m , wonder why he did that , maybe he had it coming ."
33,i do n't think he saw the punch . he also won an emmy !
34,do you happen to know why he won teh emmy ?
35,apparently for the work he did calling the games . he was inducted into the sportscasters hall of fame too .
36,"hear i can see why , the guy has a big resume its sad that his wife and children are left behind , a swell as three grandchildren , they must be crying a lot ."
37,probably so . snoop dogg wrote a fight song fo hs son 's high school football team .
38,"thats noce from snoop dogg , can you tell me more about taht song ?"
39,"no , it does n't say anything more about it . sorry . i can see you this though . the highest paid across ll u . s . department of defense employees are three football coaches of the service branch teams"
40,"oh i see i will have to goole it then , and they must have a good salary then , the inventor o basketball was a bad coach ."
41,14 of the world 's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college fooball teams ! i guess it is a pretty popular sport .
42,"kit os ! i love it , well i love all sports , and theres also a basketball court on the us supreme court building ."
43,do you wathc or keep up on much basketball ? it 's definitely a team sport i did n't play much of
44,i watch it from time to time as i enjoy it . a you have a favorite player ?
45,"i have n't really hold a favorite since michael jordan . the guy who invented the sport was a coach at the university of kansas , and the only losing one at that"
46,go figure . do you know who kareem abduljabbar was ?
47,i heard he was good at dunking . it was banned from college basketball for over ten years from how frequently he used it
48,yeah so strange . do you know what the nz basketball team is called ?
49,"do they have an official name , or are you referencing the nickname tall blacks ?"
50,yeah i m not too sure but that is certainly what they are called
51,apparetnl7 the supreme court enjoys a game of basketball too . on th stop floor of the building they shoot hoops at what was been called ' the highest court in the land . '
52,"good for them , how handy to play there at work ."
53,many of my friends growing ups here big basketball and footballs fans . the highest paid state employee in 39 of the 50 states coaches one off those two states at the college level
54,i guess it pays to be a coach then . the players tehmselve salsa get paid like a bit too . do you listen to the radio much ?
55,"i do n't , actually , but i use other things that utilize radio waves . it 's pretty crazy how the sound can be attracted and trnasformdd over miners"
56,actually if you turn it to am you can catch jupiter 's storms
57,"those are some strong storms ! considering how many artists are fro canada , i would n't mind tuning to stations taht have to play at least 40 percent canadian music by law"
58,yes very true . do you know how soldiers used tom fake adios durant wwii ?
59,"from what i remember , all it could take is a pencil and razorblade , through i 'm not sure how it would make sound"
60,i do not even know what channels they would be able to listen to
61,"if they were in europe , it would be interesting if they could pick up finnish stations . one of them has a new program in classical latin"
62,the one that gives the news in latin right ?
63,yes . that would be an interesting program . i wonder if episodes are available online ike classic radio dramas are
64,hi are you a football fan ?
65,"hi , m no no really . are you ?"
66,i watch it during the season because i do n't have anything better to do . especially for the money and thursday night games .
67,"i get that , especially when there is only 11 minutes of action in a game . i guess the rest is commercials ?"
68,s n't that crazy that it 's such a short amount of time for something they drag on . 3 hours ?
69,i know ! they sure do milk it for all its worth .
70,espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line on tv . tha thas been a good addition unto watching games .
71,"yeah , that was a good addition . ca n't believe that benjarvus greenellis nerve fumbled . amazing !"
72,that 's an incredible stat go hve ! hue average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl or mlb player . probably due to having longer careers .
73,"yeah , that 's what i would think . off careers are proabably pretty short on average due to injury , and it is really hard to get to the majors and stick there long enough to make an serious money"
74,yes . did you know that there is no written rule that prevents females from playing in he if ? maybe we 'll see on soon ?
75,"maybe w will ! that would help out ratings , i would think . maybe then they 'll start letting the can 's cheerleaders eat in the same restaurants a the players . what a stupid rule !"
76,that is an odd rule fo sure ! kind of dumb ?
77,do you a can ? they are amazing creatures . one is a mayo i alaska !
78,i ahve one outside . yes they are . i would like to see the cat cafes they have in japan . do you know how those work ?
79,yes ! they can pay by the u it play with cats nd have drinks . seems liek a cool place !
80,i agree ! when a cat reaches the age of 15 they have usually spent 10 of those years sleeping !
81,that 's a life well lived lol . cats can also coauthor physics papers !
82,what ? that is crazy ! lol there is a cat name stubbs who is the mayor of a town called talkeetna in alaska ! how does that work ? lo ; l
83,i wonder who that cat ran against ? it would 've been funny if the other candidate was a dog !
84,hahah yes it would be ! i 've had a good tme chatting with you !
85,me too . have a great day !
86,"hi , how are you ?"
87,well thank s ! do you know anything about keith jackson ?

89,me as well . im a huge michigan fan so he is really memorable with his ' hello heisman ' call
90,"notice . i feel liek he was on a lot of michigan able , was n't he ?"
91,"yeah we was . when he retired in 1998 , the michigan marching band spelled out , ' thanks keith ."
92,that 's such a nice gesture . for the longest time he was the voice of college football . did you go to michigan ?
93,i did not just a big fan . my favorite player of all time attended there so it was how i became a fan
94,who is your favorite player of all time ?
95,charles woodrow . keith jackson was also announcing that game when he fermented his heisman against ohio s
96,nice . i liked woodrow . i went to illinois so i do not have a much to cheer for as you do . i do remember getting stopped by michigan many times and the hitting hte bars are . . .
97,rough haha . it jackson was park of a lot of memorable games ! including gwen woody hayes punched a player
98,i ca n't believe he was criticized or that call . he went back and classified on the call .
99,i know right ! at least he was still able to an emmy and be inducted to two sportscasting halls of fame
100,"yeah , there are a few iconic voiced and he is one , along with musberger , costar , and al michael ."
101,all great voices . sold be good for radio as well a suv
102,"yeah . when reading , i did not know he did s many sports . that 's a ton of calls ."
103,i now ! even the olympics
104,hew and to russia to call rowling during the col was too . that takes guts .
105,oh wow i did not know hat ! thats some rocky 4 stuff
106,nice chatting with you ! have a great day !
107,have you heard of keith jackson ?
108,"yes , he is teh voice ot college football right ? do you know what broadcast he was on ?"
109,h did saturday afternoon broadcasts on abc . seemed he had a long fulfilling life . he was 89 .
110,i do recall him covering a wide variety of sports for radio and television . do you recall what he would coal the linemen guards ?
111,he had a lot of funny terminology . like a ' banter rooster ' and ' whoa nellie ! '
112,he was a very funny and interesting man . something elses hat is funny is the university of iowa ; painted the visiting locker room pink . oi wonder what the visiting footballs was thought about that .
113,yeah it was probably before pink became popular for professional softball players to support breast cancer
114,do you watch a lot of football ?
115,"not really . how about you ? i know that football has really grown in popularity . in the 60s , top bowlers made twice as much as football stars ."
116,"yes . i am a big fan . i love researching about the history of football do i just read he other ay that in 1916 , the highest score ever in a football game was 22 too 0 . georgia tech vs . cumberland . we do n't see such wa high number like this ."
117,wow ! probably would not have been the case if benjarvus green ellis was on their team . he has never fumbled the ball .
118,that 's right . green ellis is a sure player for sure that like kareem abdul . his dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade !
119,that 's funny ! i 'd like to watch all basketball in the us supreme court building 's called ' the highest court in hte lapd '
120,really ? what teams usually play there ?
121,i think it 'd just for the employees at the building . wonder if any judges play . hmmm . . . .
122,do you know he the inventor of basketball is ?
123,i think that 's named naismith and he is the only losing coach in the university o kansas 's history .
124,we ; l its better to be known or that than the name of th renew zealnad basketball team .
125,"are ther any famous college football or basketball coaches ? in 39 out of 50 states k , the highest paid state employee is heather a college football or basketball coach"
126,id o n't now them by the but i am sure there are . it was nice talking to you .
127,nice talkin do you .
128,"hi , how are you ?"
129,i am well thanks . how deep do you think ncaa baskeball violations go ?
130,not well but i also think the ncaa is so weak now that the fikndigns of any major sanctions will be difficult and take a long time o investigate . what about you ?
131,"it in there is a lot behind the scenes that we do see . some coaches have co , e out canda admitted to it . arizona coach sean miller discussed a 100 , 000 rib veto land star recruit de'andre payton"
132,i know the actor allegations were dismissed by him but he advent of sneaker companies acting as intefmeidearies has complicated the investigation .
133,i did not know that . i feel bad for these kids . they are begin fused to like a lot of money . an di dot feel are fairly compensated even with a scholarship
134,"i agree . i think the should let the kids forgo theirs scholarship and make money instead . can you imagine how much money some f these kids could make ? and if it werent for the fbi , this arizona or sean miller or payton scandal would not have been kno . it ' e ridiculous ."
135,and the ncaa keeps saying thay can contra everything but its impossible . a 18 year old kid gets offered money . who says no ?
136,right ? i would ask for even more . i have no idea how i would have walked away and say no to that offer . what about yu ?
137,it would be really hard to say no .
138,yeah . i wonder how successful teams like duke can be at that high level and not break rules . . .
139,"and its crazy to think 39 out of 50 states , the highest air state employee is either a college football or basketball coach . these kids helped get you money . and not all of them wil lake it pro"
140,i know . i wish there was more they could get . . .
141,football has got to be crazy to . its a money maker for a lot of colleges
142,"yeah . the only good thing about this mode is that it made or the lesser s ; sports , like swimming and volleyball ."
143,did you know espn won an emmy for teh creation of the yellow first down line
144,i did not . i was also shocked to find out the university of iowa 'd locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink
145,is crazy that in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . mom where the money isn ow
146,or that hte highest score beer in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 . do n't you hav to pull the qb when you 're down 60 ?
147,i wonder how long that game lasted . even without commercials interrupting
148,ah that ' sold have alerted for ever . . . like listening to nuntii latini a weekly news programme conducted entirely in classical latin
149,there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas or free
150,do you like cats ?
151,"yeah , cats are cool . do you own one ?"
152,"no , but many of my friends do have an or are , they sleep a lot"
153,"apparently , after living for 15 year , 10 of it is from sleeping ."
154,"that is a lot . did you know there is a town , where the mayor is a cat ?"
155,"i think that is in alaska , right ?"
156,"yes , the town is talkeetna , and teh cat has been major since 1997"
157,"wow , i wonder if he has o makes a lot of executives decisions ?"
158,i guess he is a very honest major . i would like to o to a cafe where one can play with cats !
159,"yesh , me too . they had a cat in the opening scene pf the godfather ."
160,did you know a cat was the named coauthor of a book ?
161,"yeah , but a physicist right ? i ponder why tough ?"
162,that is right ! hey do you like football ?
163,"i do . i watched the superbowl a few weeks ago , mind of boring for th big game ."
164,season is over ! ! when th season starts they only rest one weekend d !
165,"yeah , well apparently iowa pants their locker room pink for visiting teams ."
166,"that is so funny , they want to intimidate the visitors , right ?"
167,"yeah , it sounds like it . i 'm surprised it is allowed , are n't you ?"
168,"they allow many things , did you know the nfl would tallow a woman to play , where is no rule against"
169,"wow , no i did n't know that . he there beet any female players ?"
170,i do not think so . well it has been nice chatting with you ! take care
171,radio is such a fascinating technology .
172,"good morning , yes radio is great . i was a dj on the radio !"
173,that is so cool ! i always thought that would be a very stressful job since you are always live on the air .
174,"it could be t times , l i remember when i was at the ohio school for radio back in the 0 's . i had to do the earliest you , and it was one thing walking up so early to do a mma shift , let alone the teachers taking out the needles for the records , so i couldnt play anything andc ad to talk ."
175,wow . . that is crazy . did you ever play one of the old radio dramas ?
176,"no i did n't , that would have been a good and easy radio thing . just pipe in the radio broadcast and sit back ! they would always have the own commercials during those shows , thus i would n't have yo talk or do anything ."
177,it wild have been neat to b there her some of those broadcasts first came over the air . it was like tv that required thinking .
178,"i ; r have to agree . in radio training , they did ave me nd a colleague broadcast a demolition derby at a county fair . that 's fu n , though we had car parts flying all over our broadcast booth . , t that was n't very fun logging the things ,"
179,demo debris are crazy but fun . it should almost be classified as its one sport . it definitely cakes endurance to compete in one of those .
180,"yep . . . . wow , i did n't know that keith jackson passed away . dang it . . . . he was a good sportscasters for espn ."
181,i never knew much about him . i 'm not a huge sports person . wash e well known ?
182,"keith jackson was pretty much on every saturday at espn . yep , he was a pretty wellknown guy and a good announcer ."
183,was he ome of the announcers that went into it after a career in sports or someone who just started announcing ?
184,"i believe that keith jackson was just an announcer , but he did it for a lot of years . that 's one of he guys i thought of whe a went to school for radio . i never did sports talk professionally , but always wondered how i would do doing football games . but , all i got ws a demolition derby . . . lol"
185,"lol . . i think you on us with the demo , football always seemed like a really slow game to m ap lots of talking an awaiting around but very little gamer play ."
186,"thati 's why i liked my training in radio . it taught me how to relay information to the audience . and after i left radio , i went into club djing . heck . . . i 've never been afraid of a microphone !"
187,is djing as exciting as movies malek it out to be ? given my experience in the bar scene i feel likd it wild be a lot ot annoying drunk people .
188,"well , ye s , you just hit it . club djing was very very different than doing it on the radio l i remember getting disturbed by many a drunk person in those clubs . you had to be pretty quick with the comeback to when they would shout stuff out . but you had to do it ' c lean ' and not upset the persona idiculing you , and at the same time make the crowd laugh h ."
189,i do n't think i would have been very good at that . my wit tends to be a bi biting and sarcastic to be said over a microphone .
190,"lol . . . . so is mine when i 'm not going an entertainer . i retired from it two years ago , and now ca n't believe what i did for all that time . adrenaline and nervous energy is what i used to do all those show z , alway told myself f , use teh seriousness as your asset , it 'll make you do a better job . . . . it did ! ,"
191,adrenaline has a funny way of making u soo thins we would never attempt normally . i think that is the there are so many thrill speeders these days . phrasing that rush of adrenaline .
192,do 70 watch the nfl ?
193,i sure do . how about yourself ?
194,me too . dud you know women can play in the nfl too ?
195,"did not know there , are ther limitations though ?"
196,"nope as long as you qualify , you re allowed to play"
197,nic ep did do hear they are placing tracking chips on the players now ?
198,"nice , are they doing chat for a particular reason ?"
199,yes they are collecting stuff such as velocity and rotation and a bunch o fighters
200,nice i hop the can use those to make the game safer too
201,i hope so to . did you kno wthe is a coach who used to b a rocket scientist
202,ther is such at kind ? what a change of careers . who is it ?
203,it is matt patricia and he graduated from a school that had tons of math symbols in the name
204,nice . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
205,i wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on the players
206,i am not sure . in the 60s bowlers used to me more than nfl players
207,yeah i guess it was a more popular and back then . their coaches are the highest paid people
208,yeah no surprise there . do you now what the highest core in college football is ?
209,"hmmm no i do not , that is it . did you hear about that giant stadium in texas ?"
210,"the highest score is 2220 , georgia tech versus cumberland , and i do not kno abut that stadium"
211,"wow what a score , the stadium is for a high school and ca unseat 18 000 people"
212,"wow that is a lot of people , but it cost a lot too"
213,"it sure did , 60 million"
214,"hi there , do you watch the nfl ?"
215,hi ! yes i do sometimes . what 's your favorite team ?
216,"i think the patriots , i like them best . one of their former qb never fumbled a ball in hi scarier . how about you ?"
217,my husband is from the bay area so were most for the oakland raiders .
218,"nice , cool . do you know what the highest score very recorded in a game is ?"
219,2220
220,yeah that must have been quite the game . do you know who played l the two teams ?
221,georgia tech an dcumebrland . are you familiar with different in of football from different parts of the world ? .
222,"yeah there are tons of different and like soccer , canadian and australian football , rugby , a bunch of them"
223,i 'm originally from hungary an door football there is soccer . my grandpa was a huge fan .
224,"nice , it is a good sport . did you know espn won an emmy once ?"
225,i had no idea . i wonder why the university of iowa 's locker room ? painted pink .
226,i think theuy did that to intimidate the opposing team but i am a sure if that really works
227,oh ok i see . do you watch basketball ?
228,i watch it sometimes . i did n't know until recently tha the dunk shot was banned because of kareem abduljabbar
229,"i did n't know that either . or that in 39 out of 50 states , the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach . there is lots of money in sports ."
230,"yeah that is for sure , lots of people watch it son o surprise dig use . do you know who invented the sport ?"
231,james naismith . interesting that he is th only losing coach in th university of kansas history
232,yeah that is pretty bizarre . she eyou heard of the highest basketball car in the land ?
233,i have n't heard o it . do you know where it is located ?
234,"yeah it is in teh has supreme court building and it is on the top floor , hence the name i am guessing"
235,what is your favorite basketball team ?
236,i do not have a favorite the just watch the games from time to time .
237,how are you ? do you watch football at all ? charles snowden recently le the va cavaliers over louisville
238,i i n't say that i am much of a football a . it seems like a very different game depending on where in the world in is played though .
239,"yea , i guess in the us it 's known as gridiron around 'the would . i gues snowden is a good player in basketball too"
240,strange hunt he would play both . they see make they would require drastically different sports skills .
241,"yea but i guess it does n't matter as much at the college level , plus he played basketbal for coach o . j . johnson who us too play football as well"
242,a good coach make shall the difference im the world . i am surprised that more former pros do n't coach especially sine they really do n't make as much money as people tend to think they do .
243,"i guess most former players are n't into recruiting players , i know va coach phd to rebuild his fooball program , must of been stressful"
244,"stressful but lucrative in you are good at what you do . the monsters seem to want to follow pros that have had good careers . especially if they are , not for som , tying like highest rushing yards or biggest lineman or never fumbling ."
245,"yea but coaching was n't always lucrative , at least not in the 1960s , the top bowlers made twice as much as the top football players"
246,i wonder if the is because they have a longer career . it seems like earth all the injuries hat football players no matter where they are just c n't keep going fo along .
247,"probably has something to do with football not being as popular in the 1960s and individual bowlers probably made m , ore money winning competitions"
248,i feel bad for the players on teams that just are n't good . it is n't always the fault of the players either . look at the superbowl this year . 1 is just bad . of course not nearly as bad aw the record holding 122 but still .
249,"yea 2220 is pretty bad , i 'm not surprised no one as come closed to score as much as georgia tech did back in 1916"
250,at a certain point during a game like that you almost want to just lol it . i would expect scores like that out of basketball games not football .
251,yea but they had lopsided scores like that in baseball years ago . kareem abduljabbar was so dominant in college that they banned the ten for over a decade because of him
252,i do n't understand the love of the dunk . yeah i looks sort of cool but the skill level is so much higher when it comes to 3 pointers .
253,well i guess the dunk was pretty impressive when few people could actually reach the hoop 10 feet up
254,that 's tru ep age food vertical is important in basketball . i wonder if they lower there hoop in wnba or if the women are dunking at the same level .
255,i do n't know the exact stats bt im pretty sure the hoop is lower than the nba 's 10 feet and the diameter is larger than 18 inches
256,i seems like it depends on where in the world the games are located . i thik in america it is more about showmanship than game skills necessarily .
257,"probably . i wonder what it 's like in new zealand , they have a basketball team nicknamed the ' tall blacks ' lol"
258,seems a bit risky to say that given the racial tensions of the as . but if they gave themselves that nicknamed it is n't so bad .
259,"football or basketball , do you have a favorite ?"
260,football ! it 's more exciting i think . i like the american version though !
261,"i agree with you , football americans for sure ! do you follow college football ?"
262,yeah i dp ! i 's so popular ! 14 of the 25 biggest stadiums are college football !
263,that is crazy to think . i think about the university of michigan and how crazy big that is . have you heard of th iowa hawkeyes ?
264,yes i have . the flags in stadiums like that weigh 1100 pounds !
265,that is crazy heavy ! i wonder how they put the up at the top of stadiums . the hawkeyes painted their visitor locker room pink
266,haah taht os hilarious . snoop dogg once wrote a fight song for his son 's high school football team !
267,"i want to hear that lol , i wonder if it was ever an he radio"
268,good question ; bing crosby sounded very popular back in the 1940 's !
269,who was bing cosby ?
270,he was a musician has kin the old days lol ! his recordings filled more han half of the radio tim in his prime !
271,"wow , i need to hear this guy 2 not in canada though , they are required to play 40 percent canadian music"
272,yeah interesting law . i wonder if they play that station that translates solar activity into sound ?
273,"i wonder too , there is an am radio frequency that catches jupiter ' r radio storms"
274,"very cool , wonder if it bust sounds like static or what ? bill murray voiced the human torch chin the 1970 's fantastic four radio show !"
275,no way ! now in and to look that up l it probably was amazing
276,"yeah i bet . surprisingly , one of the top radio acts in 1930 's was a ventriloquist . . . people must have been hard up for entertainment ."
277,for sure lo l ! to radio has come a long way . i like to go to some free website and listen to dramas on it . it was so great chatting with you !
278,oh yeah that would be cool . once a hanson song became the most requested song on an alt rock radio station lol . you too have a good evening !
279,"i love hanson , lol ! bye !"
280,hi . i did n't know that benjarvus greenellis never had a fumble . impressive !
281,"i know , right ? i thought it was weir chow the cheerleaders arent allowed to eat in th escape restaurants as the nfl players ."
282,"yeah , that is bizarre . iowa 's visiting locker room is pink . strange"
283,i wonder if that was meant to try to demoralize the players
284,seems like it would work lol .
285,i was shocked that the highest score in a football game was 222 . . . thats crazy !
286,"no doubt . and the the team was shut out ! also , bowlers used to make more than football players . that 's changed !"
287,yea it has . ; . . could you imagine i bowlers were paid more han nfl players ow ? they would make average 622 million wa year fo rowling lol
288,that 'd be nuts ! n nl game only ha 11 minutes of gameplay . . . i never would have guessed that
289,"i already knew that , which is why i get so frustrated wit chow long a game take : ,"
290,"yeah , i can imagine that would be frustrating . i usually only watch the super bowl and taht game takes forever r !"
291,"i thought it was pretty cool that the cat in the opening scene of the godfather , way just a stray . chances are that was an unbanned scene ."
292,"i 'd bet that , too . so , in asia you can pay to play with cats . . . now that 's weird !"
293,i think its a waste of money lol lot get a cat
294,"no doubt , cats are everywhere !"
295,everywhere including alaska . . . where they ar remade mayors . now thats weird lol
296,they also coauthor physics papers !
297,"im knots one the actual purpose off the , but they are both pretty strange !"
298,"yeah , i do n't get it either lol . apparently cats just sleep for twothirds o their lives away"
299,"yea , im 35 right now . . . i could n't imagine sleeping 12 years of that . no wonder cats are considered lazy lol"
300,that ' z basically sleeping 16 hours a day . . . i can not imagine that
301,i will say that i was pleased to see that at least an engineer has higher wages than an nfl or mlb player . i faithful believe that sport players are way overpaid .
302,"considering how unimportant their jobs are , i agree . unfortunately they generate a to do revenue sense people pay so much for tickets an merch . its all a waste imo"
303,hugh waste ! i think that a percentage of the earned income should automatically go to funding projects or foundation that better the citizens lives or economy .
304,"i are . what skills me are the billionaire owners that cry poor hen they want a new stadium , no way that should be paid for by taxes ."
305,hi how are you ?
306,hey ! i just got in from a game of basketball ! we had enough players for the common 5 player teams . do you like basketbal l ?
307,i do a little bit . did you guys win ? !
308,"oh yeah ! i ot 3 field goals , which are worth 2 points each . i was not used , i was glad myth team hated the most points a the end of regulation play , and he did n't have to go into overtime !"
309,good mob ! did you know the new zealand team is nicknamed the ' tall blacks ' ?
310,"no way ! i did n't know that . i was bummed that i did n't make any 3 poiting shots today , but then i remembered thats had has only one recorded 3 point shot throughout his entire basketball career !"
311,roll get it next game ! i love how the us supreme court has a bball court on the top floor !
312,everybody loves basketball ! vasectomy rates increase during march madness so that men can stay home for a few days to watch basketball . that 's pretty extreme !
313,"that ks absolutely hilarious . college basketball and football coaches make bank , apparently !"
314,"yeah , and hte highest paid across all us deparmtnet of defense employees are three football coaches of the service branch teams . maybe i nee duo start playing football instead !"
315,they are the highest paid state employees in 39 states !
316,"even high school football involves some serious money . in allen , texas , the high school football stadium cost 60 million to build ! it seats 18 , 000 people !"
317,it is funny how iowas locker room for visitors in painted in all pink !
318,i heard about that ! college stadiums are no joke . fourteen of the world 's largest 25 stadiums belong to american college football teams !
319,that is wild . the highest score of a football game ever was 222 to 0 !
320,"no way . a snoop doggs on just came on ther also , and it reminded me that he once wrote a fight song for his son 's high school football team ! i do n't think i 've never and that one over the radio waves !"
321,radio waves are fascinating . apparently you can hear jupiter radio storms on an am radio .
322,wow ! there 's also a radio station that translates solar activity into sound so that you an listen live to the sun 's music . i wonder what its rounds line ?
323,it is probably better than regular am radio !
324,haha ! i thought you were going to say it 's probably better than hanson ! but a hanson song once became the most requested track on a chicago altrock radio station because the djs did n't reveal the band . sneaky !
325,probably better than that also !
326,"i 'd rather listen to hanson tha a ventriloquist . one f the most popular radio acts of the 1930s was a ventriloquist . it baffled contemporary critics , and it baffles me l too !"
327,very interesting ! nice chatting wtih you !
328,hi do you like football ?
329,"hi ! yes , id o like football ! do you ? i was that reading about how there is no written rule against female players in the nfl . women would be allowed to join if the met thye league 's eligibility requieemnets ."
330,"yep , that ' true but seeing how big the guys are its no surprise that no woman has ever joined or wanted to in a team haha"
331,"i agree ! and semirelated , i 've heard that the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink !"
332,"yeah , that a great way to decrease team moral haha"
333,exactly ! or maybe make the other team angry ! in the 60 's top bowlers made twice as much money as he top football stars !
334,now that is weird to hear because of the bi difference in physicalness .
335,"absolutely ! i 'm sure football pays more than bowling m these days ! h i so , the highest score ever in a football game was in 1916 ! when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 !"
336,"yeah , now that is crazy to hear . how could they even let them gamer continue ?"
337,it sounds like a world record posts and wi n ! that 's pretty interesting !
338,"yeah and i 'm sure it was pretty embarrasing too , wow"
339,have you eve had a pet cat ?
340,"yes , i have 4 cats actually !"
341,"aw nice ! i have 3 cats ! : , i just found out that the cat in the godfather , movie , was as tray that wa sound on set . i hope they gave the cat a good home after filming !"
342,"tthat 's sweet to star , the cat got its own cameo aearamce !"
343,"wow , here is a fun fact ! when a cat reaches 15 years old , they 've spent 10 of their lives sleeping !"
344,"yeah , that a long cat nap for sure !"
345,"absolutely ! there are cat cafes n japan and taiwan where people can pay hourly to plays its cat and have drinks , s . i 'd like to see some of those where i live !"
346,"me too , l i have been to japan and never saw them !"
347,oh really ? i 'd love to visit japan ! htey have such a neat culture ! i even find their good interesting !
348,"yeah , it was a great experience ! well , i got ta go . it was nice chatting with you ! have a great day !"
349,"nice chatting with you as well ! have age great day ! goodbye ! : ,"
350,bye
351,good morning g ! do you like football ?
352,"good morning , yes , i do . how about you ?"
353,"yes i di , did you know that the highest score on a game was 2220 ;"
354,"8 as heard that before , i don ' think it would happen today , though . it would be considered unsportsmanlike conduct . who 's your favorite team ?"
355,"you 're probably right about that . also , i think teams have advanced in ther skills . i know this was a college game that has that score but college teams have skills nowadays ."
356,"yes , they do . my favorite team is the patriots ."
357,i like several ; professional teams to be honest . after watching patrick mahomes this past season i 've added the chiefs to my list of favorites !
358,"thats do , i never think about them . i 'm pretty mainstream and rookie . just like the new england patriots because they wins o much . do n't like being on the losing side . lol"
359,"i know what you mean . it 's depressing when one of my teams loses . speaking of the patriots though , have you heard of benjarvus greenellis ."
360,"i think i have , he 's a former patriots running back , i believe ."
361,"yeah , i heard that he never fumbled the ball in his entire career . that 's really impressive !"
362,"yes , that i impressive . i ca n't imagine the pressure he must have felt to remain perfect . i would ot have done that !"
363,i never thought about it like that but you 're right . the announcers probably mentioned it every tie he had the ball .
364,all eyes on him . laser focused o see if he messed up . i wonder if kareem abdul jabbar felt any pressure when he was doing the basetball in college ?
365,"hmm , i do n't know . i guess if it was expected of him then he probably did ."
366,"well , he was so god at i t , he got it banned from college basketball for over a decade a i 'm sure every game everyone was watching to see if he 'd dunk the ball . it you like basketbal l , too ?"
367,i like some . i did watch the women 's big 12 championship game list nigh . it was actually pretty good for a will . i 'm glad the dunk shot is no longer banned by teh way .
368,"that 's awesome , i watch it occasionally , as well . i find it ironic tha james naismith was the only losing coach in the university of kansas 's history , though . he invented the game of basketball after all ."
369,that is odd ! you would think that he would know thee lame inside ou stand be teh best at it after all .
370,"exactly , or would have at least rewritten the rules to favor his team , somehow . anyway , have you heard about the basketball court on the top floor of the supreme court building ?"
371,"no , i did n't know there was one . i 'll look into it though because i have to sign off no a it 's been nice chatting with you and have a great day !"
372,do you watch football ?
373,i sure do . do you know the u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
374,i wonder if taht is supposed to have some effect on the opposing team
375,i wonder too . did you know bowler spade more tha football players in the 60s ?
376,yes i guess football was not as popular back in the day as it is now
377,the . do you know what the highest score in co ; huge football is ?
378,so that was 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
379,yeah thati a score and all the way back in 1916
380,yeah . do you know espn won an emmy once ?
381,yes that was for the superimposed yellow line
382,"yeah they did a good job there , easiest to watch the game at homer"
383,true . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
384,yes h eis the rb thaat never fumbled the ball in his career
385,yeah . did you know women an play in the nfl l ?
386,yea there is no rule against that as long as the qualify
387,yes . the game average is only 1 minutes of play anyways
388,yeah . engineers make more than football players over their lifetime
389,yes they have longer careers too though so move time to make money
390,true . did you hear if that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
391,yes they are not allowed to eat t the same place as the players
392,yeah it is so sexist and it needs o go really
393,"hi , how are you ?"
394,"doing good ? do you follow football at all ? it 's a family of sports that includes rugby , gridiron , and soccer"
395,"why yes , i do i love ll types of football . do you liek football ?"
396,"yea i enjoy gridiron , i also think rugby football is pretty interesting too , would love to play it"
397,"interesting to me that the word ' football ' is understood to refer to whichever form off football that is most popular in the regional context in which the word appears . so football in some areas , is called soccer in other parts ."
398,"yea , i wonder if there is any other football variation types besides american football , soccer , and rugby"
399,"oj , there ' a more , for sure ."
400,"i wonder how much money other footballers make , int he us an average engineer makes , i more than an average nfl player over their lifetime"
401,i think teh true soccer players make pretty good bank .
402,i wonder if soccer players are tracked like how the nfl embed chips into shoulder pads and footballs to track things like velocity and location
403,"i guess they could place a trackers in their shih guards or shoes ? not many places to place a trackers on them , unlike the nfl players . lol"
404,"no , i guess not . it 's funny how the nfl tracks lab these stat set the average game only has 11 minutes of gameplay"
405,"i know , i felt liek the last super bowl i watched was about 3 hours long ."
406,yea that was excruciating to watch . do you have a favorite nfl team out of the 32 ?
407,i like the new england patriots and the boat !
408,he the patriots are a great tema . did you know apparently benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball in his career ?
409,"yes , that 's an impressive feat , but imagine the stress and pressure to remain ; expect . i kow i could n't do it . lol"
410,"yes tha pretty tough , probably tougher than the time georgia tec scored 222 points on cumberland back ink 1916"
411,"that sounds like a train wreck , but it would never happen today . that last super bowl was the lowest scoring super bowl , ever . on a side note , i read somewhere that the eagles once set up a court in their stadium for six years because of their fan 's bad behavior . is n't that wild ?"
412,lol well the fans in philly doh ave a bad reputation so i 'm not surprised there was an actual court inside the stadium
413,"that 's just too funny ! anyway , it ' z been nice chatting with you this morning , i need to go walk my dog , now . i 'll talk to you later , friend ."
414,do you liek football ?
415,i sure do . . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
416,i wonder if it is supposed to have some effect on them
417,i wonder too . did you know bowlers used to make more that nfl players in the 60s
418,yes i guess football was not that popular back then as it is now
419,true . do you know the highest score in college football ?
420,yes that is 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
421,yeah what a game an tthat was way back in 1916
422,yeah . espn once won an emmy for the superimposed yellow line
423,nice . did you know women can play too ?
424,yes as there is no written rule that prevents them from doing so
425,yeah and if they meet the requirements then theur ar good to go
426,yeah . teh average gameplay ios only 11 minute anyways
427,true adn yet wr are glued to the tv fo hours to an end
428,yeah . engineers make more than players over the lifetime
429,yes i guess they also gavel longer careers to it as up
430,true . did you hear of that rule for saints cheerleaders ?
431,yes they are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players
432,"yeah and worse , try have to leave mid meal if they walk in"
433,yes it is it sexist and it really need to go now
434,"i agree , things have changed now . nice chatting with you ."
435,"hello , you follow th nfl much ?"
436,i do . i am getting really to watch the playoff games
437,"for sure , who you rooting for ? saints ?"
438,absolutely and the patriots .
439,"for sure , did you know the saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating at restaurants containing nfl players ? i ma rooting for the patriots also"
440,"yeah , its a bit hypocritical of the team adn the nfl to have a rule like that"
441,"for sure , very sexist . speaking of he patriots , did you now benjarvus greenellis never fumbled in his career"
442,did n't he fumble a couple of week saga ?
443,"he recently retired a yea roar two too , that is impressive . hopefully the patriots take a note fro , him during the playoffs"
444,this ears 17week season has wrapped up and now we hit the playoffs . who do you think will win the super bowl was year ?
445,"i think the bears have a chance , but i think the saints will make a run , you ?"
446,70s l i am worried though this may be the last year of brees and brady . i wish have to find a young qb to follow now
447,"for sure , patrick mahomes is killing it and a good role model , he may be the next star qb if he follows up with another great season"
448,i am really loving watching that kid above all the other young qbs in the nfl .
449,"for sure , do you follow college football at all ?"
450,a little bi a i am a secret fan of the chiefs . i follow ohio state on the college evel
451,"for sure , i am a iowa fan , did you know thy painted their opponent thicker room pink ?"
452,"yeah , thats a bit ridiculous . i need to look at pics online to see what it looks like ."
453,"for sure , it was from their coach years ago who was a psychology graduate . good chatting with you , you were fast and informative !"
454,you as well
455,"go patriots , bye !"
456,good evening partner . what 's your take on football ? i like watching american football but not rugby .
457,"i like football nd doin like rugby or gaelic football , t he normal version is the one that i like"
458,a similar to my liked ! i like all levels . hee was a high school team tha played despite their science building burning down in th background !
459,"they did , you know that there is a really expensive high schools stadium in texas , it has a cost or 60 million to get build"
460,wow that is a huge cost . seems like the fans need to behave better i philly . they have a court setup in the stadium !
461,"they do ? i wonder why , that is really strange"
462,yes because of their fans bad behavior !
463,"oh i guess that makes sense e , having a court there and having the trails in the moment , 14 out of the 25 largest stadiums in the world are of college football teams"
464,exactly . so that is impressive . college football is big . tim tebow wawa big 83 college but not som much the nfl . he was actually offered to play arena football by kinds .
465,"not really sure who is tim ow but yeah , and great college players dissapointed later when the go to the nfl"
466,"yes it is tough to make it . maybe someday a female will play , there is n written rule against it ."
467,"i stink that will eb great , there should b alike a female nfl league ,"
468,yeah that would be interesting . on average an nfl game only lasts 11 minutes !
469,"only 11 minutes ! that sure is a scam , have you ever seen those hue flags at the stadiums ?"
470,yeah they are huge . 9 think the university of iowa has one and they also have pink locker rooms !
471,"thats funny , nd yeah i bet they do , those laws cost 50 , 000 a hand weight a lot"
472,wow interesting . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer makes more than that of an nfl player !
473,"that kind of makes sense , engineers do have larger carreers"
474,yeah and they do n't get injured nearly as often !
475,"no , most football player send up with brain damage or other injuries that is really sad"
476,yes it really is . hte movie concussion was vey insightful for that . well it was lovely speaking with you today . enjoy teh weekend .
477,"it was , it showed he reality of the game , the hidden reality and i hope you ahve a great weekend s well , thanks for the chat , bye ."
478,i 'm wondering when women are finally going to play in the nfl .
479,i think there was a womens ' league years ago not i am not sure . it was not the nfl though .
480,was that the league right lingerie or something ? five or six a side football ?
481,"something liken that yes . but i think if a woman wants to play in the nfl and is good enought , she should be allowed ? ."
482,o wonder if some can play some positions like kicker and punter because size is not really the issue ? what about male cheerleaders though ?
483,cheerleading is really hard ! you have to be athletic . i have a male friend who was a cheerleader in high school and he was great at it .
484,i 've heard tha the salts cheerleaders ca n't eat in the same restaurant as the players . what up with dat ?
485,i had n't heard that ! wow . i have heard that cheerleaders have a lot of strict rules though . do the footbal players have a lot of rules they have to follow w ?
486,probably rules about drug use . and standing during tha national anthem ! : 0
487,haha ! i ca n't believe how much football coaches get paid . i heard that the coaches for the military texas get aid more than anyone else in the department of defense . tthat 's crazy !
488,that 's the market for you . there 's so much money from tv and stuff . i part that in the past the players really did n't make much . now engineers make more over their careers than pro athletes .
489,it seems like it is very easy to ge injuries thati an end a career . so engineers probably are able to put in a lot more years at their jobs .
490,"yeah . it 's a fantasy to think a person could become af football player . seriously , engineers are needed more than player . priorities in society ca get screwy ."
491,i went to high school with someone wo played for the panthers . now eh sells cars . you ' e right about priorities though . football is more important than academics in most high schools and colleges . they spend a lot of money on it .
492,"i would play high school to get a scholarship though . the best way to get an education is to be a good athlete , not a good student ."
493,ish very there is a high school stadium int exams that cost 60 million . i do n't really stink that is right .
494,how much money goes to textbooks after the stadium is payed for ? i heard that a high school team kept playing a game even when their school was on fire .
495,i heard that 14 of the world 's largest stadiums belong to college football teams . . . i wonder how many of those are estate schools . our taxes should n't be paying for that .
496,i wonder how many jobs are created thought . i know lots of people love the sport .
497,"that is true . i think maybe it would be better if instead o school teams it has more like the european soccer system , where you grow up playing for a club and the nfl o ."
498,"yeah , that 's true . no ckfnusion over the purpose of school ;"
499,i 've enjoyed talking about football ! i have to go and have my dinner now .
500,great !
501,chris thompson will be a key player to helps he redskins quarterback alex smith this year
502,"yeah , i heard his health ha improved a lot ."
503,he comes from florida state and worked his way back fro ma fracture fiba ending teh 2017 season which was too bad
504,he sas a little nervous getting back on the field but he 's finding his groove again .
505,i 'm glad he reports it felt good and he 's able to make playes
506,it will be about 18 months from the initial injury until he feels like himself again though
507,did you hear that top bowlers in the 60 's made more than top football stars by 2x 's ?
508,that 's so interesting considering how crazy our nation 's or football these rags !
509,the highest score in a football game was a whopping 2220 in 1916 so hat is embarrassing !
510,i wonder how that happened ! that ' sa game i 'd love to see . i 'm not really into football . the average snl game only has 1 minutes of live gameplay . maybe that 's why it does n't keep m interest .
511,"the nfl also is using tracking chips in shoulder pads to record moves and footballs to track velocity , rotation , ball speed and location . i guess you have to perform without excuses !"
512,"yeah , football is a serious sport ! you can als see how important it is by the technology that is developing . apparently , espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line ."
513,"if you go to the eagles , you have to watch your behavior because they had a temporary court set up in their stadium for six years due to heir fans bad behavior !"
514,that is funny ! i wish people would be more into women 's spots l women are n't prohibited fro making in the nfl but have yet been able to meet eligibility requirements .
515,that woudl be awesome for them to show their skills someday ! did you hear about the high school football team that kept playing in 6 even though their science building burned down behind them . i 'm surprised they had a separate science building .
516,that 's interesting ! will you be watching the superbowl ? i heard its coming up
517,i hope the eagles are it again . hopefully they do n't have to set up a court though
518,ha . i do n't usually watch football but will probably watch the superbowl . the suspense is exciting .
519,"the commercials are usually fun , and ho does n't like good food and friends ? if you visit iowa check cout he pink visiting teams locker room at university of iowa haha"
520,"hey , pink is n't such a bad color . a lot of football players wear it to show support for breast cancer fighter and survivors ."
521,that 's true ! kiss bought into an arena football team and offered a contract to tim tebow . wonder if he would make emit ? nice chatting !
522,hi do you watch the nfl ?
523,i sure do . do you know how many teams are in the nfl ?
524,yes ther ware 32 fears divided between nfc and afc
525,right . did you know women ca play ?
526,yeah there is no written rule against them playing if they qualify
527,yeah pretty neat . the game only has 11 minutes of active play after all
528,yeah that is short and we are glued to teh tv for so long watching the game
529,exactly . did you know engineers make more than them over their lifetime ?
530,i am not surprised as teh hav longer careers so more time to make money
531,yeah true . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
532,yeah about them not being able to eat in the same place s teh players ?
533,"yah adn worst , they have to leave mid meal if they walk in"
534,yeah it is really sexist though and shold be vanished
535,i hoped that happens . did you know the are putting tracking chips on the players now ?
536,yeah they are using those to track velocity and speed and all that stuff
537,yeah i hope they can use those that to make the game a bit safer too
538,hopes so too . u of iowa painted their visitor locker room pink
539,hmm i wonder why . bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s
540,yeah that is crazy . espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow line
541,yeah that is great because it has made watching the game from home much heavier
542,true . do tou know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
543,i was unaware that the top bowlers in the 60 smart as much as top football stars .
544,"yea , most football players had regular jobs when they were n't playing so i guess it 's not unrealistic for top bowlers to make more than her during the 169"
545,"yeah , crazy . espn won an emmy or the creation of the superimposed yellow line that represents the 1st down marker ."
546,it 's funny how it took so long for someone o think of something as simple as putting a yellow line for a first down took do long to be thought of
547,i wonder if it was the fact that teh technology did n't exist at the time ?
548,"it 's possible , i mean now they have tracking chips embedded in every player 's equipment , funny how far sports hows come along"
549,"interesting , concept though"
550,"yea , it 's neat they can measure things such as velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location"
551,"well , the university of iowa 's locker room is painted pink , crazy"
552,"that 's crazy , i wonder what color the locker rooms were for the arena football team kiss bought"
553,"i ' , not sure , that 's a great question though , probably black and white ?"
554,maybe that 's why tim tebow never signed with them
555,"i do n't blame him , to be honest , i think he ie overrated though ."
556,"yea , not a great qb , would have made a better rb , not as good as benjarvus greenellis though , he has n't fumbled in his career year"
557,"i think so too , funny you mention that . i 'm not all that surprised that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
558,"no , it 's not that surprising they only play 11 minutes when you think of all the time they spend between plays setting up the next play"
559,"yeah , sometimes when i 'm watching a game e , i think taht thy do take a for too much time running the clock out and stuff , bu do well ."
560,it ' funny how grueling the game is on your body when there ie only 11 mins of gameplay nd 16 games a year
561,"yeah , i remember reading about some players having to sit in a the full of ice after the ga , me was over ."
562,"yep , it 's a rough sport , the eagles even had their own court room in their stadium"
563,"i head about hat , i 'm not sure where though ."
564,i remember a stand up comedian make about the eagles having their own court in the stadium before
565,"yeah , well the average nfl player makes less than an engineer over the course of their life ."
566,hi . do you watch football
567,"yes i do , i am especially interested wright now in following jordan reed to see if he will really be able to take hte next step in his promising career after his surgery ."
568,who is your team
569,"well , jordan red is on the redskins , so i am following them currently ."
570,"i see . do you know that the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 , and the score was 2220"
571,"yes , i did heard that before ! i wonder how much money footbal players made in that time . i heard that in the 1960s it was only half as much as popular bowlers of the time ."
572,"yeah , that fact surprised me a lot ."
573,i was also surprised to learn that espn won an emmy for creating that yellow first down line graphic on television . i never realize that sports media could las win those hollywood swords !
574,i do not know how a sport program coul doin an emmy . did they have an acting skill ?
575,"no , i guess that the yellow line thing was so innovative for american football media coverage at the time that it was considered worthy of an award !"
576,"i concur . btw , did you know that homer patriot running hack benjarvus renee , in never fumbled the football in his career"
577,"no , i did n't , but that 's impressive . i wonder if they have used those nfl tracking chips in the shoulder pad to record his speed and velocity and stuff ?"
578,i do not think so because this is a new technology
579,"oh , that 's a good point ! well either way it 's too bad that football players even toast talented only make half as much as engineers"
580,but it is quick money and fame .
581,yeah busta lso i sound slick they control your life quite a bit ! even other athletes such as the nfl new orleans saints cheerleaders have strict rules against setting in a restaurant at the same time as an nfl player .
582,i see . did you know that nfl has no written rule against female players . they are allowed to play if they meet the requirements
583,"wow , so the nfl actually treats women better as players tha nthe cheerleaders get treated apparently !"
584,"i would think so . btw , nice chatting wit hyou . happy holiday"
585,"merry christmas to you , and i 'll leave you with this fun fact : the university of iowa 's locker room provided for visiting football players is completely painted pink !"
586,thank you .
587,"i thought that was funny , hopefully the teams are did sports ."
588,"hi , do you like college foot ball ?"
589,yeah bu ti do n't get to watch at all . how about you ?
590,i do love it and watch it all teh time . do you have a favorite team ?
591,i do n't who 's yours . did ou know the iowa visiting locker room is painted pink .
592,i am a illinois fan . we have nit had much to cheer about lately . i heard rumors about the locker do . i wonder if it works .
593,not on me it was just make me made and want to make sure i won ! how abou thou ?
594,probably not . 9 am not sure i could ge more laid back or passive . i just dont care . . . i would car if i got beat 2220 . i would have a team meet after that .
595,"oh my god yes that bus ride home was either screaming our dead silent , lol ! cumberland got their butts kicked ."
596,i hve never heard of that school so i wonder if they just raised after that beating ?
597,yeah that sounds about right ! lol ! ! did your hear hat espn won an award ?
598,they have probably won s lot . for what ?
599,no they won it for that superimposed yellow line ever the first down .
600,i feel like that is a low bar to huddle . a yellow line ?
601,i know but it made life watching the game on tv that much simpler .
602,"it does . i am surprised they still have old guys measuring first downs with chains . it is 2019 and tennis uss computers nad sensors , ca n't the nfl ?"
603,well apparently they are spending all there money on tracking chips .
604,they could use it in footballs to figure it out . hey need tomb e better . plus it would speed up play .
605,right well there is only 11 minutes of live game play anyway .
606,"9 know . i need as com , trials and chan gang time though ."
607,"right ! those chains are too funny i never even thought about that , lol ! ! ! would want to be a new orleans cheerleader they get treated like second class citizens if there eating at a restaurant and a player comes in ."
608,sexism m ! nice chatting with you !
609,are you a big redskins fan ?
610,"no but i like haha clinton dig and alex smith as ; layers though , i am a vikings can , how about you ?"
611,i am actually a patriots fan but i think it was smart of them to ive up a fourth round pick for dig .
612,"for sure , he is a good p ; layer and good for defense . i am ot a saints fan too much though , i do n't like how the treat their rcheerleards"
613,definitely od how they have a rule that they cant eat with players .
614,"right , i feel that is sexist and why the otter 1 other teams do n't say anything !"
615,i am pretty sure the nfl is still a private business they can kind of do whatever they wan t .
616,"that is a good point , lol . did you ever abot the tracking chips they use in shoulder pads ?"
617,"something long those lines , it track there speed or something ?"
618,"yea it tracks all their movement and other data . pretty interesting ! they must hav bee creat by engineers , making the big bucks"
619,funny you say that the average engineer has higher lifetimes earnings than an nfl player !
620,"wow , i should have been an engineer instead of reading about playing in hte nfl lol ! do you have a favorite college team ?"
621,i woul have to say university of iowa .
622,"me too , that is my alma mater ! in you hear about their locker rooms ?"
623,"i hard they are pink , is that for breast cancer or somehting ?"
624,"that is true ! that would make sense but htey are for the visitors as a calming method . it is psychology 101 , teh color soothes and makes you relaxed"
625,"wow , t hat i some newt level stuff ! former patriots running back benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled a ball ."
626,that is such a good feat he did . i feel all the running backs ever do now i sfumlbe the ball . he needs to teach a clinic
627,"ya , even crazier is that average nfl game is only 11 minutes ."
628,that is not a lot of time lol . it take the game from start to finish like 3 hours lol
629,"exactly , well great chatting ."
630,"you too , i hope your night i awesome !"
631,"hello there , do you follow the nfl at all ?"
632,"kind of , bu only in passing , i would do say i was an footbal , l expert ."
633,"i am not an expert myself , but i follow enough to know what is going on , and i watch all my favorite teams games ."
634,what would be your favorite nfl teams ? are they any good ?
635,"i ike the ; packers , they were n't very good this season , it was a bummer ."
636,"i live in north east ohio , i think fans around here would gladly swap the pacers records for the browns ."
637,"yeh the browns have had some tough times since i have been watching , much better season this hoe thin last though ."
638,"i guess there ia always someone worse than yourself , j it heard about the team that lost 2220 . that much have hurt ."
639,"that sounds awful , i wonder how may cub , zealand fans were still in the stands when that game ended ?"
640,"or if they are back the following week . i guess you have to stick with your team through thick and thin , but that might have pushing the limit ."
641,"yeah that is the test of a true fan , that you might be critical of the management , but you always stay a fan ."
642,would you be a true fan if you ended up in the court set up in the stadium of there eagles . in europe they call those type o fan 'the ultra .
643,read i have heard a bit about some of thye ultra in european leagues and down in south africa as will . i 'm a big fan of intentional football .
644,"what always mazes me is college football and itd size , almost seem as big as professional football , i ca n't think of another amateur plot with that much of a following ."
645,that is true and the size of the stadiums for college and even nigh school footbal is insane .
646,"i know , the high school football coach is a minor celebrity around have , i ca n't say that fo land of the teachers ."
647,yeah i think the highest paid people in most states are college coaches .
648,"not sure how i feel about that ? i have to spend two kids through college on bday , with the high cost of college i 'm not sure i want a portion going to the football coach ."
649,yeah lots pretty crazy o me just how much it costs to attend collie these day s .
650,"still you kind of have to go . if not want to be an engineer , at least one that has career earnings more then most football players ."
651,"tha i true , well it was ice talking with you today , i hope you have a goo dday !"
652,"hello there , are you a fan of football ?"
653,"ia m a fan , what about you ?"
654,"i am as well , did you watch the super bowl this pasta sunday ?"
655,"i did , i am rooting for hte patriots , what about you ? the game was really close and really defensive no sure if i liked it"
656,"yeah i did n't like that it was so low scoring and mostly defense , it does not make for n exciting game . i was partial toe the , but i am impressed by the patriots domination of the league the last 2 decades ."
657,"its actually the superbowl with the finest points scored , and the patriots have done things right that is for sure , they used to have a creat player called benjarvus greet ellis ."
658,yeah did you kow he never had a fumble ink his entire career ! ? that is very impressive .
659,"i know , that is really impressive ! i bet only a few players ave accomplished that , maybe he is the only one , did you know that espn won an emmy because of the creation of the first down line"
660,yeah that is an interesting fact . i am trying to think if i can remember watching game before tech put that yellow line up there .
661,the yellow line has been there a long time and i thin that the emmy is well deserved ad it hs definetely contributed with a lot to the game .
662,"yeah i think it has really changed how people were all to watch and cheer , it makes so much of a difference ."
663,"it does , i guess thats why game were so unfair in old times , there was a team that lost by 222 poiting"
664,"yeah is n't that crazy , i wonder if there were any defense playing that day at all !"
665,"i know , it seems like the other tea nwas blind or they were all injured , another interesting fact is that bowlers made more than football players back i 1960"
666,"yeah i thought that was pretty wild . i guess if i got the chance o do it again , i would b epa pro bowler in the 60 's !"
667,"i guess thats a safer sport , football has proven to cause a lot of brain damage in players so thats not good ."
668,"reach it has , if you ever watch the movie concussion , with will might , it definitley makes you thin twice abou how much damage the sport does to ones body and brain most of all ."
669,"i think ive seen tht film before , 9 will google it later or maybe its available i netflix , there is a crazy rules the new orleans saints have , its really sexism and rude in was t ."
670,yeah that rule seems o outdated and dumb . i ca n't believe that is an actual rule .
671,"i know right , i mean cheerleaders could actually sue the team for something lie that , its a rule that should be abolished"
672,"yeah i could n't agree more . well it was nice talking i you today , i hope you have a good day ."
673,are you a nfl fan ?
674,i am not . are you ?
675,yeah i enjoy warchijh the nfl . . i think there 's 32 teams in the nfl .
676,"what is your favorite team ? it is surprising how much the nfl has gained in popularity . in the 0s , top bowlers made twice i much as top football stars ."
677,"i really like hte titans . however , the quarterback is out with an injury ."
678,"oh , sorry to hear . i guess i am not into football because there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
679,bu ti 's 11 minutes if action ! ! the super bowl will be coming u ; p soon . .
680,i hear it 's th first sunday in february . i might get together with some friends to socialize .
681,it sure is . . usually the day after my birthday . . . he highest scoring game in footbal nwas 1916 georgia teach beat cumberland 2220 . . they must have bad offense and defensive .
682,"wow , how is that even possible ? it 's interesting how there is so much technology used these days in fooball ."
683,it . . especially te graphics on television . .
684,i heard espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow line
685,i bet . that was brilliant ! ! i wonder if we an play in the nfl ?
686,"i read that they actually can , if they can meet requirements . sadly no women have yet ."
687,this is nuts . . if a saint 's cheerleader is eating in a restaurant and a football player shows up htey have to leave . they are n't allowed to eat at the same restaurant as the players . i wonder why ?
688,"yes , it seems unfair that he cheerleaders have to leave nad never that players ."
689,extremely sexist ! !
690,ended . i wonder ho wthe can still get away with it .
691,i 'm not sure . there is no good reason for that rule .
692,"and also it seems that being a football player may not be all it 's cracked out to be . an engineer actually , yes more i na lifetime !"
693,eight an their bodies probably are n't hat banged up likd a football player .
694,"hello there , do you follow the nfl at al l ?"
695,i love the nfl . what about you ?
696,"i follow but mostly my favorite team , i do watch more during the playoffs i will say though . how about you ?"
697,same here . who 's your favorite was ? mine is the bengals .
698,nice ! i used to play with the bengals in tecmo super bowl all the tim . i 'm a packer fan .
699,haha i love tecmo super bowl . did you know iowa painted the opposing team locklear room pink ?
700,"each i heard about that , i wonder how ave the final ok for that to be done , i bet they were n't overly pc lol ."
701,not too sure lol . teh 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as the top lol stars .
702,"that is so crazy , it just shows how much bigger the nfl has gotten since then ."
703,i agree . bowlers probably do n't make a whole lot these days .
704,"no not stressed also , but i still think it would b pretty sweet to make a living throwing those also around , ploys of women too lol ."
705,that would be pretty awesome . got ta love the attention too . lol
706,"oh yeah , greasy hands , thin crust frozen pizza , and lots of high life beer ."
707,lo l ! the highest score ever in a football game was 2220 .
708,"holy crap , i think i have read about that , oh cumberland so sorry fo you lol ."
709,yea that is bad . greenellis has never fumbled th football in his entire nfl career .
710,"that is very impressive , i wonder how many total carries he had ?"
711,"not sur on that , but i know he was a starter so i 'd imagine a lot of carried ."
712,yeah thats true he was so probably ad recent amount you are right .
713,"in the nfl , there is no written rule against women playing ."
714,i think it would be upper cool if a female player made a roster and go to see some relax gametime . nice chatting with you today !
715,do you watch the nfl ?
716,"a little , you ? i ca n't watch like i use to years ago so im not current ."
717,which of the 32 team is your favorite ?
718,well back in the day it was the green bay packers . not sure how they rank these days though . so it 's the national football league which consist of the nfc nd the nfc right t ?
719,"yep , 16 in each i think . i 'm a vikings fan . what are your thoughts o teh saints"
720,nothing really liek i said have n't watch in whole . whew hat do you now ? i am aware that they plan to put tracking hips isn player padding as well as the footballs .
721,"if their cheerleaders are eating at a restaurant and teh players come , htey have to leave , kind o sexist"
722,i think so . do you know in austria rugby is consider to be football ?
723,"i did not know that , that s more brutal i think . i wonder if their actual gameplay lasts longer than then is 11 minutes"
724,so many commercials i guess because that 's hard to believe . do you know about the high school in allen texas ?
725,"do sure , what about that school ?"
726,"there is a high school in allen texas that seats 18 , 000 ppl and cost 60 million to build ."
727,"wow , i heard that a while ago . waste of tax payer money . do you have w favorite college team ?"
728,i do n't i ever only watched pro if given a chance . i it much different ?
729,"not too muh , i am an iowa hawkeye fan , they paint the visiting locker room pink !"
730,"haha , that might just make m mad and want to win even more . so how do you feel about the tracking chips they are about to start using in the pro 's ?"
731,"for sure it is supposed to calm them down o it i heard about that , probably made my engineer so make more money than nfl players do in their lifetime"
732,"yeah i get that but give me the 1015 a i 'm out not the 4050 , you know ! so do you know how long a regular season last ?"
733,"i dont know how long it lasts , how long ?"
734,i believe 17 weeks but every team gets a nye week so they play 16 games a season .
735,nice taking to you !
736,"hi turker , are you a fan o nfl , if yes do you watch thursday night football ?"
737,"i am a fan , my thursday nights woul n't be the same withou that sacred sport , what about you ?"
738,"i feel the same way , i like thursday nigh football and i hope nothing change ."
739,"it seems like the thursday packages isnt going anywhere so that is a good thin , did you know disney is the owner of abc and espn ?"
740,"no i had no idea , since disney always had it own change , they must shave recently brought abc and espn ."
741,"yeah seems like they are buying everything there days , star wars , marvel and now those two channels as well"
742,"wow , disney doing good , i knew there was the disney channel for many years , when i was small that was my favorite channel ."
743,"it was eat channel i liked it as well , crazy to much money to one and also ho much moeny football moves , 90 million for thursday night games alone"
744,"wow it 's amazing , did you know espn is laying off large numbers of workers ?"
745,"no i didnt know that , its terrible , i wonde why , have you watched the bing bang henry ?"
746,"i used to , but not any more since they got older , after that seems like things was n't the same ."
747,"well its a really funny show , it has an average of 18 million viewers . the nbc has great series in it ."
748,"yes i read about that viewers , did you k , now tha tween has a chance to play in the nfl if they meet eligibility ?"
749,"i didnt know about that , want do you think about that rule ? would you like to watch a woman int he nfl ?"
750,"i do n't think so , because this will change the entire paste of the game , i do n't think 25 rand 300 lbs menwould want to fickle women head on , i would like to see a wnfl , women only ."
751,"read i dont think its a good sport to mix genres , do you know who matt patricia is ?"
752,"no i do n't hav easy ideal , does he have something to do with the nfl ?"
753,"matt patricia is a male lol , he is a rocket scientist and also a coach in the nfl"
754,"wow , i feel a little embarrassed for not knowing that , first chance i get i wil dread upon ham ."
755,"patricia its a girls name so do n't worry its na honest mistake , eh must be a really smart guy though being a rocket scientist and all"
756,i tough it was a woman at first . did you know that only 11 minutes of live playtime in a nfl game ?
757,"no did n't know that , 11 minutes of live playtime does n't seem right , anyways im getting kind of tired , its late so im going to call it a night ."
758,"yes you are right , it was nice chatting with you also , good night ."
759,did you know that minnie mouse 's name is short for minerva ? haha that is weird
760,"i had no clue , i so did n't know disney was rounded diy roy disney soo"
761,"no i did n't know that , or that walle was named after walter elias disney , i wonder if that is walt disney 's son ?"
762,"i wonder how , dig guess there i sa lot of obscure disney stuffy ike hidden mickey mouse images"
763,"yes , i remember reading about how they put hidden images in their movies , i bet there is a blog or youtube channel tha showcase a lot of it , very strange too that bill nye was a consultant for the disney movie flubber , i remember that movie was not good haha"
764,lo do and i do n't think it was that sdcietnifically accurate . i do n't see why they did n't just put bill nye in the movie .
765,"haha had would have improved the movie for sure , i like robin williams too , tha movie was just a real singer , did you liek big hero 6 ?"
766,"do n't know much about . hero 6 besides all the toys they seem to sell , apparently it took a 55 , 000 core computer to render it"
767,"ya i was wondering about that , i though the movie was only ok , theres re definitely better dissent animated movies , but i 'm ol maybe i 'm biased to me classics and not their newer stuff"
768,well they have been making movies since 1923 so there is probably a lot better movies out there
769,"yes they have a long history , do you watch football t all ? ; i know a little about it and i will be watching the superbowl , but i do n't personally really care what happens with the teams"
770,"yea , i follow football , mostly the giants , it 's hard to keep up with all 2 teams"
771,"ya i agree , for me it seems kind of boring , and apparenlty there is , on average , only 11 minutes of actual gameplay in a given nfl game , that is like nothing"
772,it 's crazy ho where is zen average of 11 minutes of gameplay and 16 games a season
773,"you , so not a lot of actual gameplay but as of commercials and lots of watching men standing still waiting to hike the ball haha , i 'll be thinking about that during the superbowl this year"
774,lots of injuries and stats too . all the players have chips embedded int heir shoulder pads
775,"yes i think that would e useful for tracking all and of stats , thats almost like a videogame at that point twitch the stats you could get , also weird that the average engineer makes more in their lifetime than the average nfl player"
776,well in the 60s top bowlers made more than football starts lo . i guess football careers are quite short
777,"ya that must be what it is , that is funny because today it is the complete reverse , also crazy that the nfl would allow a female player if she could get the requirements , did think we will se ref female nfl player in our , lifetime"
778,yea since there is no rules against email players as an see one become a place kicker
779,"i was thinking that ya , nothing would stop them from becoming a kicker . i think a linebacker might be too much though , that would be a massive woman . haha"
780,did you know that disney owns abc as well as espn ?
781,i did . do you watch football ?
782,"yes i do , i am a contributor to the number one ranking for viewership of sunday night football . do you ?"
783,i watch it sometimes . i do n't usually watch thursday night football tough .
784,"yeah , me neither , do you have a favorite sports team ?"
785,"i do , i like they redskins . what about you ?"
786,i like the dallas cowboys because i grew up there and luckily th cheerleaders sarah n't treated like the saints cheerleaders where they are forbidden from eating in the dame restaurants as the nfl players .
787,interesting . apparently the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
788,that 's super short and yet i find myself devoting a whole afternoon or evening to watching hte game . so the players do n't technically have to be in relax goof shape then right ?
789,"yeah , i usually go out . but i can believe that it is only 11 minutes ."
790,yeah but they probably need time to play those expensive adds but there is all that money king if the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the earnings of a nfl player ?
791,"yeah . i can believe that , engineers make good money in some places ."
792,i 'd imagine petroleum engineers more a lot of money too . i have yet to see ay fidel players play in the nfl even anough here are no written rules against hem from playing .
793,"yeah , there were female players when i was in high school though ."
794,"oh wow , did they have to meet the physical requirements or anything ? did the females shar teh same locker rooms as the males ?"
795,i 'm not sure . not when i was ins school . the one player was a wire receiver .
796,"oh ok . like football , i was watch a lot of disney movies , m y favorite re the animations by pixar , such as walle , have you seen it ?"
797,i 've watched some good disney movies in my day . minnie iss shorts or minerva .
798,"i did n't know that , that 's also not a common first an either . i wonder icy here are people game after the character . perhaps a pet or something ."
799,"yeah , and apparently bill nye was a consultant for flubber ."
800,is that how bills nye got his big break ? hew as the consultant and then realized taht he could also become an entertainer as well . i like watching him too !
801,"oy , i miss football season . i love espn 's monday night football offering . what about you ?"
802,i do n't really watch it though sometimes i inadvertently end up watching thursday night football .
803,"ah , yes . during football season , it can be hard to not catch at least part of a game . did you know abc id the on , y one of the 4 major broadcast networks without a primitive nfl game ?"
804,"i heard disney owns had and espn so they are considering bidding on the cbs and nbc football pack , age ."
805,"yes . i would seem like a smart investment . eight of the top 10 single telecaster were nfl games , including the super bowl li , which was number 1 ."
806,"abc has n't had prime time nfl since 2005 , when it moved to espn . is it still on espn ? that would then make it more accessible to more people if it was do abc ."
807,"it is on espn for now . but , esp ncis laying off marge numbers of workers . it seems some nfl players do not love the idea of tuesday games though . richard sherman , who plays for the seahawks , said it 's too got if you 've just played a sunday game . he said yours one is still sore ."
808,that makes sense . i dd a color run last week and am stil sore . then again i 'm not athletic . haha !
809,i ca n't imagine how sore they must be . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ! ! few minutes for such pain !
810,"with , and that 's part of the reasons football doesnt ' interest me , not a lot of ive gameplay . i also get lost sometimes . the superimposed yellow in helps out a bit . espn won an emmy for that ."
811,"they deserved it ! that really helped me ! it looks a little cartoonist , but hey , i love cartoons , especially disney !"
812,"me too ! my favorite character is minnie . i do n't really like her but name , minerva ."
813,they are so clever with their names ! did you know that walle was named as a tip of the hat to wa ; tear elias disney ?
814,"oh , i could have figured that out but i dd n't haha ! wall e is so cute . have you found any hidden mickey mouse images in other disney films ?"
815,"i have't . . . yet ! i just got clue ino that subculture recently . i wonder if there are hidden images al 'the my back to the company ' founding , back on october 16 , 1924 ? i say have a lot of catching up to do !"
816,"yeah , me too . gives me a reason to rewatch everything . wonder if there are any in nigh do 6 . i have n't seen that but it was made using a 55 , 000 core supercomputer ."
817,"they really do use technology , do n't they ? they even got bill nye to be a science consultant for flubber ! they ' v become a long way since 1923 !"
818,and hey have grown to 14 theme parks would the world . i 've only been to one q
819,"who would have guess that from their start in animation they would breach out to theme parks , live action film , and even sort soft he nfl !"
820,"yeah , i bet their merchandise is a big par to it too . i love to collect it ."
821,i forgot all about the merchandise ! i wonder if there are any minnie mouse or nfl crossover polls ?
822,"haha , there should be . i feel like ther are ? or maybe i 'm thinking of he nfl potato head i have . peakign of which , time is clean up a bit . see you !"
823,goood morning ! hope your day is going well
824,it is going well . i 'm considering catching a movie what will you do today ?
825,"i 'm working today , looking forward to the weekend and some relaxation . tomb ad football season is over its un to waste away a sunday watching football !"
826,i agree patriot said their job too bad for the rams . i think i 'll catch a disney movie ther ball and the internet sounds good that 's a sequel to a movie that was in hte works for a long time !
827,"yep , not a fan of either team , but the patriots are amazing probably wont see a run like this again , and they 're not done ! , . my kids saw wreck it ralph 2 and loved it , disney does a good job"
828,"can the patriots keep it up forever , that 's the key i think the risks og football more a bit high , however a i 'm glad disney keeps at it . of course disneyland , all the hype and all the merchandise , makes moviemaking well worth it ."
829,"tom brady and bill bilichick will keep going forever ! neither wants to be proven that they can win without the other . disney movies are starting to rehash the classics , but like you said with all the merch , how can you blame them ? ! ? !"
830,"did you eve wonder how tv years all those great soft sofa plays at the football games apparently they use tracking chips embedded in shoulder pads yikes , someone is always watching you ! i liked that commercial about the be going to even and getting the new car fro mis grandpa then he woke up and was in his cubicle at work and someone had heimleched him so funny !"
831,i 've heard about the tracking chips in the pads or on players and i wonder why the do n't put a chip in the ball so they know when it breaks the plain of the end zone ? i do n't think i 've seen the commercials you mention was it on during the b ?
832,good idea about the end zone . the commercial was in the same bowl and cracked em up because when the guy recovered after being apparently gone for a bit it was back to work and he really wanted the car ! so funny !
833,i guess i tuned out the commercials like oi tuned out most of the sb game . . . . and our game offs squares was terrible !
834,"sounds like you are a big fan tinny fact , are average engineer makes more in his lifetime than the average pro footbal player i think engineering is safer ."
835,"tilt does n't surprise me at all , given the average career in the nfl i less than 3 years and while the superstars and a ton , the average guy does n't"
836,i think that the political controversies of the past few years has n't shelled the sporty of much some people just want to watch folks pals ball . is the the patriots owner is in trouble today so that 's another negative out there . back to disney are there any animation films up for oscars this year ?
837,"i heard about the message parker thing on the radio shocking ! ! ! i think ralph freaks the internet is up for a nascar . isle of dogs will win , i think"
838,is n't the incredibly 2 movie out there as well ? my kids saw it and liked it sounds like it and some dark moments too maybe beyond litte did ages . speaking goof footbal salaries a fun fact in the 60 's a profesional bowler madam lure than an nfl player .
839,my kids love incredibles 2 too i bust realized my kids see many movies without me . . . . i wonder how much money op pro borders make ? most of the professional athletes did n't make such money until the tv revenue started rolling in and popularity of the superstars
840,i 'm sure tv had a lot to do with it . another fun fact 'the highest scoring game was in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 212 to 0 . ouch . poor coach !
841,talk about a blow out ! cumberland folded it 's program after that game i get . . . .
842,i bet they coach changed careers after that how can you carry on with taht on your resume . i guess thats will btw turn 10 right t ? should we wrap it up ? hope you have a good day if that ' z true .
843,great chatting wit hyou have a great day !
844,the ros3nane reboot did not las along did it ?
845,"not with he ron it . i beard i is still in , but maybe under a different lame ."
846,"the original show was kind of good . to as not ' california ' pretty , but showed middle class . unusual for the day ."
847,"very much so , it also showed real struggles , which didnt happen much either ."
848,i suppose the unreal part of the show is the way we all get to comment . sara silverman ' loved ' the reboot . here are many others .
849,everyone has the right to their opinion . sometimes it is just best for those int he public eye to be careful how they state theirs .
850,"so , roseanne was a trump supporter , the sister wa so , on the show , , do you think that the portrayal of trump supporters was unreal in some way ?"
851,"i did n't watch i am but i heard that the portrayal caused some problems , because it created politics as irrelevant ."
852,"irrelevant must be a hollywood buzzword . south par k , a leader in irrelevant , aired a spoof of family guy , as how about irrelevant . item cakes my hole argument irrelevant ."
853,i wonder if that made the flowers they got from the simpsons crew . . . . irrelevant . . lol
854,it might have . i can not remember the episode o simpsons where ar neither appears or is mentioned . do you know what that one was about ?
855,"i dont , honestly i dont even recall that episode . there are so many of them ."
856,"yes . there ar so many . the ideas are rereading . there are over 750 episodes of pokeman , thats 50 a year for 16 years . some times you have to end a show when it time ."
857,"yeah , like 15 years ago . . . . lol"
858,i always wondered who narrated thomas the tank engine . that was a nice relaxing show . those troublesome trucks are at it again .
859,"well you might recognize some voices , ringo star and alec baldwin each did 52 episodes ."
860,even there was george carlin and the seven words you can never say .
861,i love carlin explanation of the f word as al parts of peach .
862,that is a classic thing . he has done a lot over the years . do you suppose he would like the 3 horizontal lines form venu items being called a hamburger icon ? carlin might not have likd computers .
863,"yeah , i just tall that she menu button . i dont know where hamburger came from ."
864,"hamburgers cause me joy . constant novelty from it , kin links cause addiction . maybe there nee be no other relation ."
865,how do you feel about internet use these days ?
866,"it is very necessary for communication purpose , to known anything happening int he different part of the world . over all , it is very good ."
867,did you know that people can become addicted to clicking links on the internet because of the constant novelty ?
868,yes . we use it whenever necessary otherwise we suffer good it . online shopping is biggest revenue for all companies through internet .
869,stat 's interestings o think about . did you know what the library of alexandra ahs a safe copy of the internet in case it al ; falls apart ? i wonder what that looks like . what medium do you think it 's saved doin ?
870,i have no idea about it .
871,seems like you 'd need something pretty big to save a copy of the whole internet ! i think yesterday was the anniversary of it 's invention was n't it ? i though i saw that o google .
872,mobile internet connectivity played an important in access the internet in the recent years . smartphone play a major role in it .
873,"how that all works is crazy to me , wireless internet stil blown my mind . did you know that you can get 3g cell service at the top of mount everest ? ?"
874,it is very interesting . email is the important communication service which is available in internet . now days postal service is reduced due to its .
875,i wonder if that ? s a goo job a bad thing ultimately ? i know there are al ot of jobs that people are n't interested in having nowadays i wonder if mail carrier is one of them ? also less paper is probably a good thing too right ?
876,"some people stopped readings newspaper , they simply using app for news also . ordering food through interet . data sharing is the main feature in the internet . we able to send file to friends , staff etc . . ."
877,"that 's interesting , and since everyone carries phones around these days all those things are easy to do"
878,yes . television is a mass medium for advertising and entertainment . it earns largest revenue through ads only .
879,i wonder how that 's been affected by netflix these days .
880,"lot of changes in size and technology of television , after second world war only black and white television are available . tv serial are very famous and t has large number lol fans ."
881,ther more a lot of long running shows on tv still surprisingly . did you know there are over 750 episodes f pokemon ?
882,"pokemon is liek of most of kids . in early stage , heavy cathode tube can be replaced by the flat panel technology , lcd . there are so many development ."
883,"tv has changed a lot these days you 're right ! i still remember having a great heavy tv growing up , and now they are so flat and light !"
884,"tv composed of multiple internal circuits include the turner for receiving the decode for broadcast signal . now we are using digital technology , via internet also ."
885,that 's true i remember when the converter boxes were a big seller . did you ever watch that 0 's slow ?
886,i had no chance to see it . very nice chatting with you . have a grea day .
887,nice chat ! have a good day
888,thanks .
889,bye !
890,the president 9s hte title given to teh head of the government .
891,that 's true it kind it 's called different things in different places though right ?
892,everyone in finland has the right to an internet connection .
893,"that 's interesting , do you think that itnerney access tenure is free then ?"
894,lincoln was the first president to ne photographed for his inauguration .
895,"that 's interesting , well it was nice chatting with you bye !"
896,bye !
897,have an ice day !
898,the redskins really and alex smith back in locker room and more importantly on the field dont you think
899,alex smith as a great asset . hew for the time to really get a feel for people
900,its a shame that he is seeing the same troubles as griffin did . its uncanny .
901,he was in the league a long time . at least he gave the game everything he had
902,i inst ' think he was all that of a qb but his teammates really took to him right away
903,he was a true professionals .
904,i do n't think with will be the same even if he does make it back to the field after his gruesome injury . much like griffin he might be a back up but thats all
905,well at least he will get back up . thankfully since them nfl uses tracking chips they can track players moves and help avoid crazy injuries
906,he does have an education to help too ; hd has a masters degree
907,yah he is clearly smart saving earned his degree so quickly
908,"one qb i do n't like it baker mayfield , i wish he would have stuck to professional gaming instead of football"
909,i 'm confused as to why the saints cheerleaders cant eat in the same restaurant teh players that seems like an absurd rule
910,it is ; proof of the hypocrisy of nfl and its rules
911,you need n't look hard to find proof soft sat
912,this year 's 17 weeks season has wrapped up and now its playoff time
913,i wonder who will be the nfc and afc champs that will go to the superbowl in feb
914,it is likely that we will only see 11 minutes of actual gameplay no matter who plays
915,yes no ot this year
916,do you think we will ever se a female in the nfl ?
917,its not against the rules so it is likely someone ifr raising theft first frame nfl player as we speak
918,i hope to see at least s field goal kicker as a woman
919,hey here do you ever watch the reboot of roseanne ?
920,i did not watch the reboot . was it a good reboot ? i do not usually like reboots .
921,"i thought it was ok . it was n't as good as the original but i did get some laughs out of it . , what do you think abou 'the presiden to the way"
922,i think he ahs a very manage completions .
923,well apparently there is a president in zimbabwe called president banana
924,they couple do a musical number . i think that many fans would follow .
925,see i like that idea haha . maybe they could make a lot of money so that trump could be back into the top three richest presidents of all time
926,"he should have all three spots realistically . he is popular enough for 1st in and 3rd place , like in his beard contests ."
927,"haha , that do you think they ' l about going back to the rule before 1805 were thee ice president was the runnerup candidate ?"
928,that was some sort of punishment to humiliate the loser . it was there to make sure that the history books recorded the loser in the white house .
929,haha well all i know is that going vick president clinton would be a very crazy thing with president trump lol that would be s lot of drama
930,i think that it would spark new romance in the oval office . the two of them have been making sooooo eyes at each other fort he longest time . she sent him all kin doof emails too .
931,yeah i would like to see that lol anyway do you use the internet a lot ? have you ever clicked on a hamburger button before
932,i click on the hamburger button to order food for my cell . th guards bring it then . it is not always hamburgers though .
933,the name hamburger button makes me hungry lol it even looks like a hamburger because it has three horizontal lines on it
934,that is true strangest of names for a button . it has no condiment on it ? how is that a hamburger ? hm .
935,"speaking of the internet though , did you know that only 7 percent of people read eh full terms of service online ? maye ther ware hidden hamburger bus on that page lol"
936,the terms are usually written in chiefs or spanish to something else . that 's why peopel do n't read them .
937,"haha well that makes sense an , have you ever visited mount everest by he way ? apparently they do hav internet access at the peak"
938,"true was a field trip o mt everest , but my parents would not sign the permission slip so i did it go . i guess they internet up there must be pretty rare and natural ."
939,"lol well maybe i will go one day and take a selfie at the top , at least i know that i will have a working phone with internet access up there"
940,did you know that hugh laurie is he highest paid tv actor ever ?
941,"hi ! no i did not know that , very interesting ! i was reading an article about the patriots josh daniels just flight take a coaching position ! do you watch football ?"
942,"i do s little bit , i want be patriots to win tomorrow , what about you ?"
943,"yes , i don ' flow it very much but i definitely like the patriots . daniels has been one of teh highest paid coordinator , crazy !"
944,"ya that is crazy , did you know that kellan moore i left handed ? hes th only end in the nfl"
945,"wow , you would think there would be more left handers ! i like how the nfl has o rules against females if they ever requirements ."
946,"ya i was wondering that , i can see a female kicker . to be honest we wool probably see that in our lifetime"
947,"i hope we do see females in the nfl , but man that is a tough sport and i cant ' imagine getting tackled . so interesting though that a full footbal game ha only 11 minutes of actual live play . . . so i guess you could hang in there that long ."
948,"yes that is crazy because games an hours to watch , also crazy that the nfl puts special chips in their uniforms so that they can track things like speed and location"
949,"i know it is crazy . i dud n't know that , very cool ! there is so much that goes oh during a football game !"
950,"there is , i read tha tamer mayfield was a halo 3 champion and could beat anyone in his campus at that game"
951,"wow , hhaa that is pretty interesting ! i love the quarterbacks in football , they are the best at being a leader for offense , love it !"
952,"ya that iss true , do you watch football ? do you know who invented the huddle"
953,"i watch some football , do n't have a lot of time to watch it . i think the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback so nobody could outside the huddle could read the hand signals . . . . ."
954,"haha that is true , i wonder how goo he was , i wonde win he could call audibles even though he was deaf"
955,"very inter4edtingt thought , how rough would gta be to play football while being deaf . so do you watch the superbowl , there ' a a lot of drama this year about the nfl and superbowl ."
956,"that would suck , and hes irma going to a party tomorrow , i want the patriots to win hat about you ?"
957,"we always watch the superbowl , will have a couple people over but nothing big . i am rooting for the patriots though !"
958,"haha e too , do you like michael caine ? i guess he only got to acting to chase cute girls haha"
959,"haha , that 's funny ! he made the right choice o get into dramas ! i like jim carrey in dram films but he so n't do drama anymore . love his comedy soo though l ."
960,"ya he di d , i should have followed in his footsteps , and i guess jon hamm taught the girl from the office , erin , when he was a teacher , d definitely did n't know that"
961,i am sad the nfl is over until the fall . watching the 32 teams compete till the is one final champion is so much fun
962,"yes , i enjoy going to teh games ! what are your favorite teams ?"
963,i linkin the redskins bu they 11 minutes of actual gameplay can see like it takes hours .
964,"lol , i know exactly what you mean ! omg with can be so frustrating !"
965,"when i was a kid i always wanted to play in teh nfl , b ut my goal of ewing th first female player was not to be ."
966,"aww , that 's a shame , there is no rule against it . thank goodness ! what position do you like ?"
967,i aways waned o be a wide receiver but i am pretty sure i would get splashed likd . but . i dp not think the new orleans saints would like it though theyd seem somewhat antimen
968,"yeah , they her to change that rule ! that 's not acceptable . is n't it unusual there is only one left handed qb ?"
969,"that is quite strange , since leftie pitcher spare so common in baseball ."
970,"true , what do you think of brad johnson throwing a touchdown pass to himself ?"
971,i had never heard of that ! was it batted into the air and he caught it ?
972,"yes , did yu know there was a coach that was a rocket scientist ?"
973,"no what team did he coach ? i k , new that alex smith was a brilliant quarterback who was working on a masters degree when he was drafted"
974,his name was matt patricia ana aeronautical engineer .
975,very cool . i knew ther nwas a deaf quarterback once that was why the huddle nwas invested
976,"yes , so the other teams could n't see his plays . i agree very cool !"
977,baker mayfield almost quit football to competative game full time probably a safer occupation than football !
978,i trink your right . would you watch a show shot in an ikea store without the store knowing ? called ikea heights ! lol
979,wow i have never heard of tha tone i likd veto watch old episodes of house i fast believe how much they paid high laurie for that show

1048,sounds possible according to the article . i know nothing abou footbal .
1049,"i just do n't think t would be with indianapolis , maybe denver is more likely"
1050,da e know why e backed out of his job with indianapolis ?
1051,he is still with new england . he should stay with bellichick and the patriots
1052,ha bellichick been there for a long time ?
1053,about 12 years now with brady and josh
1054,wow the players have tracking chips embedded in their shoulder pads . thats going a bit fat is n't it ?
1055,no i do n't think so . i believe it helps players get better with analytics
1056,sounds like you or a football fan . i 'm amaze people let their children play anymore now that we know the brain damage it causes
1057,its is my safer and thai sent week will bring to a close another safe 17week regular season
1058,"sure , until the cte shows up in brain spans years later . theres only one lefthanded quarterback in the whole league ."
1059,i thought there were other left handed qbs like tebow for instance .
1060,i 'm just going by what the factual section says . and tebow is a baseball player now is n't he
1061,not sure but its good that alex smith has an education to snl back on now wth is major leg injury
1062,"i do n't know who that is , but if he was drafted din 2005 he 's go to be getting kind of old now for football"
1063,maybe baker mayfield can be traded and help alex while he is out with his injury .
1064,its interesting that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback
1065,"yeah , that was so the other team couldnt ' see the hand signals"
1066,"yes , so i read . i wonder if he was actually a pro player"
1067,"he was , he is in hall of fame"
1068,this was intense
1069,if josh daniels leaves the patriots for the colts that would be amazing . i 'm more they patriots .
1070,im over them too . i went to game recently in miami and the amount of pat fans was insane
1071,i guess he backed out of the offer for the colts adn stayed with the patriots .
1072,"yea . they make ne not even want to watch anymore , its not even fun when they win no amateur what in the super owl . give us something different"
1073,brady side the daniels is the best in the league . i am waiting for brady to retire .
1074,"i agree , waiting for the same ."
1075,he 's going old and wasted ut . i guess its good for daniels because the patriots want to keep him and he 's under contract with them .
1076,"daniels , opted to remain in new england"
1077,i beg teh colts were disappointed .
1078,"nfl observers have n't forgotten how the colts ' coaching search went down in february . ' w e were disappointed . unquestionably , w e were disappointed and surprised"
1079,well sometimes people what changed but they just ca n't make the leap . did you know daniel was tube denver head coach ?
1080,i did not know that
1081,i guess since he 's considered the best i nthe nfl he will have plenty of teams it choose from . . the 's 32 teams . . . i think . . .
1082,i believe you are correct . i thin skits ridiculous the amount very get paid though . insane
1083,all for entertainment . the sun bowl will coming up soon ! !
1084,"very soon , about a month to go . then they sill hate so much money blown for advertise , lent lol"
1085,i wonder who will be the half time entertainment ?
1086,i think maroon 5 and travis scots is that i heard
1087,travis so has gotten very popular since he 's with a kardashian .
1088,"oh yes , very true . that interesting observation"
1089,they bring the drama . i think is is his manager too . . .
1090,"i wouldnt be surprised . il have to look into it actually , i dont now if you know about conspiracy theories but these observations make me very curious"
1091,"interesting , conspiracy theories ? ? i 'll have to look it that ! !"
1092,yes there are very many involving the kardashians thats or sure .
1093,they practically run hollywood . ice even the world in some cases .
1094,yes ! exactly very true and kind of scary
1095,soon they ill run th nfl ! ! ! haha
1096,hi do you watch television ?
1097,yes i watch tv . you ? i like the simpsons and there 's only one episode where bart witcher appeared nor was mentioned .
1098,thee crew was really nice as well . they set the cast of south park flowers
1099,oh yeah you 're right when they the aired the final family guy episode .
1100,"tv is a mass medium for advertisement , entertainment , and news . is there anything else you enjoy ?"
1101,yes it is indeed . i enjoy the internet . it ; s addicting and can cause measurable cages in the brain .
1102,it is hard to get away fruit he internet . even mt everest has service !
1103,"yes that is so hard t believe ! when buying a product or service online , only 7 percent of people read the full terms ."
1104,"did you hear about the lady who read thet germs this past week and won 10 , 000 . it might e worth swing"
1105,are you kidding me hat is maazign ! i 'm going to start reading them . the current library of alexandria has saved a copy of the internet in case it burns down .
1106,i wonder how they saved it . it is just a connection of computers
1107,yes good going i 'm not sure . teh three horizontal line menu on apps and besides is called a hamburger button .
1108,do you thnk the president likes hamburgers ?
1109,oh yeah i think every american loves the good oldfashioned hamburger . maybe of the president of indonesia thoughhe e is busy releasing pop albums .
1110,thats really col . i wonder what his stage name bus . ca n't be as cool as president banana
1111,yes i agree zimbabwe will always hold the tilted for giving 'the coolest nickname .
1112,i wonder i the pop albums wil help the indonesian president become one of the wealthiest
1113,"good question . i 'm sure he 's trying to catch up with , , washington , and jefferson ."
1114,even our current guy and his claims hve n't topped thai list !
1115,yes very true . maybe one day . the us president guest house is larger than the actual white house !
1116,it was nice chatting with you ! have a nice sway
1117,"hello there , did you ever watch roseanne when it was first aired ?"
1118,"i think i was a little too young . i remember seeing reruns , . . at least the title song and her scratchy voice ."
1119,"oh yeah that scratchy voice was so annoying , but the show did have some funny moments ."
1120,what do you remember from the show ? any interesting plotlines ?
1121,yeah i remember when episode abou 'the daughter using dress . i though it was pretty good .
1122,not knowing your background . . . did you think it was an accurate portrayal of the issue ? daughter experimenting and confront by the typical middle american family ?
1123,well maybe for teh typical american middle class family but not for all . are you a big fan of tv in general ?
1124,"i do n't have satelites or cable , but i do have netflix and 'll at some things online if someone recommends it . it ; s different from classic tv , but i think it 's the modern equivalent ."
1125,oh yeah it is the modern equivalent for sure . the way people watch is continually evolving .
1126,what out you ? do you use internet to tv shows ?
1127,"no i do n't , i have cable , mostly to watch and records ive sports programs . i do find myself still flipping through channels sometimes thought . i found this awesome 2 hr program about the beginning of the american circus which was awesome !"
1128,i mostly catch sports summarized on youtubes the next day . what did you find interesting from that circus show ?
1129,"i noticed how much fun all of the circus performers were having . during the depression it was not a bad job to have , even h stop women performers earned as much as the men !"
1130,i 'm glad to hear that it was a diversion from the depression . it seems like that would be a welcome entertainment for a sad nation . and one without a political spin to it .
1131,yeah it was fun entertainment for everyone and it was such an attraction get people could n't miss it when htey would come t town . the emotion picture industry beginning hurt a bit though .
1132,"the whole concept of a travelling show , only in town for a short while seems to have evaporated . widespread movies , t v and internet entertainment make everything everpresent . i think it 's overload ."
1133,yeah the times hav changed for sure l like you said earlier too wish netflix and all changing television now as well .
1134,"of you think the would be a benefit , societal , not economic , to have regional releases and a more staggered release of shows , even movies ?"
1135,"maybe , but i think it 's best to just let the market decide things for itself . i think you just have to continually evolve to stay relevant no matter what the business ."
1136,"yes , the market forces will be stranger . . . i do n't think it would change at all . i just feel bad not ' keeping up ' with shows and such , so i ca n't talk bout it with friends if i 'm ' behind ' ."
1137,"yeah i hear ya , there are so that i still have get to see an episode and everyone watches it . nice talking to you today ."
1138,hello did you know the president guest house is bigger than the white douse ?
1139,"hi , i had hear that . i guess he wants his guests to he very comfortable ? i ' ? ve seen to white house and it 9s small , i 've seen bigger private homes ."
1140,"oh nice , 8 hae never seen it ."
1141,i bet on a school trip as a kid . it was small to me even the still impressed me just small .
1142,did you know the president of indonesia had 3 pop albums ?
1143,"wow , he must not be too busy being president , if he has time to make pop albums . lol"
1144,"yes , right . i guess running hte country was easy for him ."
1145,do you know who the top 3 wealthiest us presidents were ?
1146,"yes , trump , washington and jefferson lol i looked it up months . on google ."
1147,"cool , i figured trump was on that list , at the top !"
1148,did you know there is . cell service at the top of t . everest ?
1149,"no , but it makes sense , people have to be able to post those selfies they take a the top of the world !"
1150,taht true ! if there no pic it didnt happen lol
1151,exactly ! i hear the current library of alexandria has a copy of the internet in the event something happens to it .
1152,thats a good idea ! i cant go back to living without internet lol
1153,"ms either , what did people do ? sit around and talk to each other face to face ? lol"
1154,dont be ridiculous . we used cans and string to talk to each othe r .
1155,"lo l , the internet has many good uses , b ut all that clicking on links can cause real addiction in some people ."
1156,"oh wow , . well i hope they have some support groups ifr his addiction ."
1157,"probably do , they just need to click a link on the internet ."
1158,isnt that feeding the addiction though lol
1159,"good for business and business is good . ad but true ! well , it 's been nice chatting with you . hope you enjoy your day ."
1160,"have a good one , nice chatting with you ."
1161,"hey there , do you watch nfl ?"
1162,i do watch the nfl . 32 teams in the league . i 'm a bears fan . are bad kick ended it for me was this year .
1163,did you know women can pay too if tey qualify ?
1164,i had her that . i recently discovered that they use tracking chips in players pads and the football .
1165,"yeah , i wonder what kinds of statistics and rivals they are collecting and using it for"
1166,apparently it 's just tracking every movement accurately . but i wonder why they are not using what at to make calls instead of just relying on reviews ?
1167,i am not sure some things are really strange with the nfl sometimes like that rule for the new orleans cheerleaders
1168,i fin stat rule very upsetting . it seem quite sexist to me that if a cheerleader is eating first an a player enters she that to leave .
1169,"i now , it is so sexist and unnecessary . woman can play if they qualify but can not each at the same place ? weird"
1170,"yes it ' w very upsetting . i 'm not surprised that since the brown were introduced in 99 , ben roethlisberger is the qb with the most wins in their stadium ."
1171,"yeah . on another ipic , do you like drama ?"
1172,i definitely do . how about yourself ?
1173,me too . i really like the tv drama house . did you ever watch it ?
1174,i 've seen a few episodes . was n't hugh laurie wel paid for that
1175,"very much so . he made 700 00 per episode , imagine that"
1176,that 's crazy ! do you like jon hamm ?
1177,"il once jon hamm , have you sen his skip the dishes commercials ?"
1178,i did not but i 'm sure i will end up looking that up on youtube today now ha ha . he taught drama at his old high school before he was famous and one of his students was ellie kemper from the office nad unbreakable kimmy schmidt !
1179,oh y no wonder she is so funny too . what a coincidence .
1180,strange how things happen . patrick stewart teaches drama now . he teachers master classes in the ' . he could be amzing to learn from .
1181,oh wow good for him . it was nice chatting with you
1182,"hello , how are you ?"
1183,"hi , great . you ?"
1184,same . what is your favorite article ?
1185,"this was cool to read . nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the ice da they ate also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
1186,that is crazy . also it says that snl has no written rule against female player . i ca n't picture a woman playing such a short
1187,i saw that also . i agree .
1188,"i recall , once a girl tried to net on the football team of my high school . it didnt work out well . the to quit"
1189,really ? did she get blasted ?
1190,her did for sure . she was only 5 feet tall !
1191,"i 'm glad to hear they treated her with respect , as na equal player . an average nfl game only has 11 minute of live gameplay ; ay"
1192,"new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave . i n't this pathetic ?"
1193,"yeah , that 's pretty crazy . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player ."
1194,now that 's surprising . i wonder how much would that be
1195,i 'm no sure . i think it 's because nfl players do not play and their 30s normally
1196,true . how about golf ? are you familiar with it ?
1197,"not really . i 've played but it terrible at it . hte average american golf course consumes around 312 , 000 gallons of water per day ."
1198,"looks intriguing . ther is a golf course in dubai that requires 4 , 000 , 000 gallons of water a day ! . i would love to see that"
1199,"wow , me too . sequel l . jackson puts a golf clause in his film contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production ."
1200,"now , thats smart"
1201,"haha , yep it is ."
1202,it was very nice chatting wit hyou l have a great day
1203,you as well . have a great day .
1204,thanks
1205,do you watch football ?
1206,"i do , what about yourself ?"
1207,i watch it . did you know there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game ?
1208,"only 11 minutes ! i want a refund for my tickets sir , that seems like a scam , pay so much for only 11 minutes"
1209,"yeah , it is a crazy short amount of time . most of it is standing around and watching them call plays ."
1210,"i still like the game , pro playes make a lot of money for only 11 minutes of gameplay"
1211,"they sure do , b , they also take a big beating on their bodies . that is for sure ."
1212,"they an up with injuries and brain damage that is a sad thing ,"
1213,"yeah , t why might be better off playing golf ."
1214,"i agree or maybe bowling g , i hear pro bowlers earned twice as much top footbal stars made back int he 60s"
1215,"back n the 60s is the key point there . i could see that , but not today ."
1216,"it was a popular sport back then as well , must be fun to visit the locker room of the university of iowa"
1217,"yeah , i heard they partied it pink ."
1218,"yeah its painted pin k , well for the visitor team at least , 8 wounder if that actually works ?"
1219,"i wonder if that is done to embarass them ? i do n't think it would work , it would probably just make them mad ."
1220,"i know right , i would feel mad about it like a disrespectful thing , did you ever hear about benjarvus green ellis ?"
1221,"no , who is that ? is he a player with the nfl ?"
1222,"he is a player for the patriots , well former player , he wa sa rb"
1223,"intresting , was he any good at he position , or no ?"
1224,yah he is a leyend i think his the only rb in the league to have the record of no fumbles
1225,was ! that is cool . wel nice chatting with you !
1226,are you as sports fan by any chance ?
1227,i do like sports . i dont get much chance to watch the days . you ?
1228,i enjoy a few . did you know that babe tht was america 's most famous golfer at one point ?
1229,rib et it didn hurt that he was a great baseball player . he could any ball a nile .
1230,"i didnt alive he was so multitalented . did you know that on average american golf courses consume 312 , 000 gallons of water per day ? !"
1231,tat is an insane amount of water rumor just a bunch of grass . i wonder how much that costs actually .
1232,"i agree it 's a huge waste . one in dubai uses 4 , 000 l 000 per day !"
1233,"rich people have their priorities . i could never afford to play golf , i think ."
1234,it is expensive . i feel like that water could be put to so much better use especially in a place like dubai that has an aid climate .
1235,i guess the oil makes them rich and money changes peoples perception of reality . in the future they might regret the waste .
1236,good point and i 'm sure they will . also interestingly . in america golf courses make up more land space that rhode island and delaware combined .
1237,i wonder how many people in the us actually play golf . it a goods sport for business but i think the cost must be prohibitive .
1238,witch the price of equipment and fees it is very expensive . do you enjoy football ?
1239,i do like to watch football . only get the chance from time to time . you ?
1240,i do . did you know that the nfl has no written rules against female players ?
1241,"i heard something about that , gut then again i won think they ever imagined a woman showing up to try out ."
1242,"possibly . an engineer makes more in a lifetime than a football player . knowing that , which career would you choose ?"
1243,"well , i am opposed to concussions and injuries , so would probably go with engineer ."
1244,i agree . it would be so much easier on your body .
1245,"or i could just be a supermodel . not many concussions either . anyway , nice chat !"
1246,that is true . it definitely pays well also . have talking to you aw well .
1247,"hi , how are you ? do you like sports ?"
1248,"hi ! i do love sports , particularly football and golf ! although with football , i wish the games were longer as tehre'sr really on 11 minutes of live nfl gameplay on average each game . that abou thou ?"
1249,i hatch football toward the end of th season . i try to catch the super bowl . i didnt see it this year thouhg .
1250,"yeah the super bowl is always a great game ! i also wish the seasons were longer as well as the regular season is only 17 quick weeks long from the beginning of september all the way to late december . it truly does fly by , sadly !"
1251,"yeah , but each game is probably pretty tough on the body . i figure that it is pretty hard to get through the season without an injury ."
1252,that is a good point . i wonder if those tracking chips tey are sticking in the players ' shoulder pads to record their every move can hopefully be used o study how to prevent injury ?
1253,"yeah , that is what i hope . the concussion or cte problem is serious , and probably starts long before the pros ."
1254,"agreed and that is so true q i 've always wondered why no female players have ben signed by any teams since they can actually play as long as they meet the eligibility requirements , bt seeing s how dangerous it is , i do n't blame the women really !"
1255,"yea h , t he physical tools needed for the game are rare . i dont think women get that big . maybe a kicker ?"
1256,"maybe so ! but then again , if they 're doing it simply for the money , they 'd be better off entering the engineering field since engineers make more ethan the average lifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players anyway !"
1257,"true . we need more people in the m , especially women . fewer concussions in engineering too . ?"
1258,"you are so right about that ! on a similar not , did you know the top bowlers made double what the top football players are back in teh 1960s ? that is just wrong considering how rough football is compared to how easy bowling is ."
1259,i think the nfl has getting going and maybe there wasnt a players union ye tnt he bowlers were quite lucky
1260,indeed they were . i just think of talented players like benjarvus greenellis who 's never fumbled the football in his entire pro career rand hook he would have been ripped off if he played during the nra !
1261,"yeah , the game generates so much cash . people think the players ge too much l , but the career is short ."
1262,good point ! but the game has come so far since then . i love the innovative yellow first down line that espn created and won an emmy for . i could n't watch a game without it now !
1263,the superimposed graphics make a big difference to the viewing experience .
1264,"indeed it does ! since there on the subject of sports , do you also like golf ? i think it 's crazy babe ruth of all people was once the most famous golfer in the us ; . he was like the jack of all athletic trades . h a !"
1265,"he could smack a ball a country mile ! anyway , g realy chat !"
1266,"ha ! but what i find crazier than that is the courses in america all mark ep more land space than the states and delaware adn rhode island combined . that is unbelievable ! well it was great chatting wih ou as wall ! hope you have a wonderful day , friend !"
1267,"yeah , we devote a lot of land to recreation wh ave a good day !"
1268,"indeed i do ! so much so , the average course consumes roughly 312k gallons of water each day . i hope you have a good day as well ! take care , friend !"
1269,"are you a big go , fran ?"
1270,"i liked to play with my dad when i was younger , but do n't keep much up wit it now . i like football and other sports more . how about you ?"
1271,"i played more when i was younger and had more free time . i 'm a bigger football fan . did yiu know taht the university of iowa had their visitors , locker room painted pink ? must have been to mess with opponents minds . lol"
1272,"yeah , but seems a little sexist , frankly . big 's a pretty sexist industry of a whole , despite technically allowing women to play ."
1273,true . ia greet . did you know that in the 190 's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars of the do ? i bet that number is reversed now .
1274,"haha , i bet the division is way more than twice 'the amount now , too . it 's such better mj be an engineer , these days , though ."
1275,i agree on the engineer part . probably because they have longer careers l did you know that espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line o tv ?
1276,"yeah , that line make sw2atcuhing the game on tv much easier ."
1277,i agree . out of the 32 nfl teams do you have a favorite ? i 'm a steelers fan .
1278,"i 'm a cowboys fan , myself , even though we 'll have rams it to the super bowl again , it seems ."
1279,they will get there again . that 's a big stadium they have and a huge storyboard !
1280,"haha , well if that 's what it takes to make it to the super bowl , cowboys have i tin the bag ! we still miss old school promo , i think . he was good in the beginning ."
1281,yes . he got beat up there the last few years . i think if it was n't for thaat thing would have turned out better . i was just reading that there are only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay in an average nfl game . i kind of was always curious of got much they actually played .
1282,"yeah , and they put all these tracking chips in everything !"
1283,in of scary when you think about it . i often wonder what household products they put these chips in . i know someone who works for a lighting company and they said their company has developed chips that are in lights taht can record audio and video and you would n't even know the chips were here . . . plus tech cost virtually nothing to make .
1284,"i 'm not surprised , e verythign is connected to an app you can talk to so of course things are constantly listening . even small chips ave to communicate to each other somehow ."
1285,scary . makes you wonder in the chips in the footballs could be programmed to be attracted t the chips in te shoulder pads of the wide receivers .
1286,"maye its ' another deflategate all over again ! htey could be in the footballs , and able to change the pressure !"
1287,"interesting point to ponder over . hmmm . . . i was looking at some golf course things nd rye average american course uses 312 , 000 gallons of water per day ! holy smokes !"
1288,"yeah , it 's incredibly wasteful . there 's one in dubai that uses four million . anyway , it 's been fun talking to you about sports !"
1289,i enjoyed n't ! have a good day !
1290,do you1 hatch fooball ?
1291,"how yes i watch football from time to time , i saw the same bowl this year , what about you"
1292,"i did , it was pretty boring this year though ."
1293,"free wit hyou , they should have had snoop dogg make a theme song for the game like he did for his son 's high school football team lol"
1294,"interesting , it you play golf ?"
1295,"i have tried to play golf but i 'm not very good , it just takes so long to do all 18 holes i thing"
1296,"i suck at it , but we drink beer and smoke cigars on the course ."
1297,"well that 's cool . i ave payed a rounds of golf and i think that nine holes is the perfect amount , i also never knew that the actual hole for golf is only 4 and 1 or 4 inches in diameter"
1298,"that is a fact i did n't know . i ca n't believe a golf course consume 312 , 000 gallons of water a day ."
1299,"yeah that is a lot ! speaking of a lot , did you know that the usa has more golf courses than the rest of the world put together"
1300,"i can believe that , it is a big sport over here . not so much everywhere else ."
1301,"they do have courses worldwide though , for instance in australia in the water hazards they put bull sharks inside lol"
1302,"taht is pretty col actually , what course is that ?"
1303,the name but i do know it 's in australia . i think it 's kind of a waste taht united states military actually puns over 200 golf courses around the world
1304,"eh , i think that military people do n't have such a good time . i 'm all for letting them have some splits . it 's a rough life , i have a few friends that do it . always moving places ."
1305,"well i would have to see these courses , it does cost taxpayers 140 a year which i think is a lot , it 's interesting though to that antarctica has disc golf courses"
1306,"wow , that 's not too bad in the grand where of things . they do have to have some leisure time . i 've never been to antarctica , have you ?"
1307,no but i do play disc goof so maybe i will make it for there one day lol its funny that kim hong ill is said to have scored 11 hole in ones in one day
1308,"wait , what is disc golf ? i 've never heard of this ?"
1309,"disc golf involves throwing a frisbee into these cabin like goals , its actually really fun !"
1310,"oh , interesting . . i 've never heard of this , will have to check it out . nice chatting with yoy ."
1311,"hi , o you prefer golf or football ? odd , babe ruth was once america 's most famous golfer . you dont ' zee golf mixed with other sports berry often ."
1312,"i like both ! did you know that the average american golf course consumes around 312 , 000 gallons of water per day ?"
1313,"that crazy to me , if there 's any presence to climate change that 's al ot of wasted water . plus land , more area in the u sin golf courses than rhode island an delaware combined ."
1314,that 's a lot of land ! there is a golf course in dubai that needs 4 million gallons of water per day .
1315,"my point on wasted water , especially if climate change drives more heat in the atmosphere . crazy . odd how sports have changed , you see where the role bowler , i assume dick webster being that old , made twice as much as the top football stars ? times have changed ."
1316,yes they sure have . did you hear about what the university of iowa did to their visitors locker room ?
1317,"i hate to admit it , but i got a writing degree matt eh university gf iowa , i did n't know about that then . i wonder if that was to porsche they out , i distract team during game preparation ? i 'm ot aware of many big 0 championships there so it must not have been totally successful . i see that theres ' no rule against women playing in the nfl , so you think there will ever be a female place kicker ? ice seen some amzing female soccer players ."
1318,"i think , we will see one at some point . what do you think of the superimposed yellow firt down line that espn created an dion a emmy got ? it sure changed the way we watch hte game on tv ."
1319,"i thought emmy 's were awards for people , is hope it was to the guy at espn who invented jist wand yes does give you visualization at first down yardrages . did you see where the average engineer makes more in his lifetime that the average nfl and mlb player ? there must be a lot of injury shortened adn shortly careers to bring the big money players contracts ."
1320,my guess would be because the engineer ha sa longer career . do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was ?
1321,"that 2220 georgia tech over cumberland , a shame they did n't ave a 10 run rule like little league baseball on that on e ."
1322,that 's what i call a blowout !
1323,hahha and the some . did you know the 's only 11 minutes of live play in the nfl game . i gues she good when you think about injuries andc he wear and tear on the players bodies sand more commercial time to boot !
1324,seems like a short amount of time and yet they stretch it out to 3 hours . lol what do you think of the tracking chips that hte nfl is putting in the playes shoulder pads and footballs to track katy ?
1325,"i how n't understand why they 'd need them on the player s , on the ball it seems like they 'd be able to take out of bounds , pass the goal line and first downs with that chip . they could either check on the referee 's performance or eventually make that the deciding ball placement . i see a lot of use in the tracking chip in the ball ."
1326,i agree . here 's an interesting stat : former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball in his nfl career . impressive !
1327,"yes , i moved to the boston area 4 years ago so i 'm in the heart pf patriot football and they talk about a lot of football facts year round , but i 'd never heard that and that is impressive , assuming he had a normal amount of carries , . i knew about canadian football , rugby and austria ruled , had you ever heard about gaelic football ? i 'm not familiar ."
1328,i ca n't say that i 'm familiar wit gaelic football . i 've never heard of it .
1329,"that makes two of us , how about those saint it the do n't allow their cheerleaders to dine in th same restaurant as the players and if a player comes in the establishment while the cheerleader is eating , she has to immediately leave . that seems sexist at least and maybe i , legal or discriminatory ."
1330,that seems like the oddest rule . it ? s been fun chatting with you !
1331,"yes i enjoyed , thank you and have a pleasant evening ."
1332,you also have a pleasant evening !
1333,hey you a golf ca ? i 'm not a huge an just cause it is considered more of a countryclub sport .
1334,no . i find it kind of boring . i know tiger woods is really good gyess .
1335,yeah he is definite ; y one of the best . it is popular though . golf courses take up more land space than rhode island and delaware combined !
1336,tiger vs phil mickelson was on thanksgiving weekend .
1337,oh i definitely did n't watch that ! everyone knows babe ruth though and he was once americas ' most popular golfer !
1338,wow . did n't know taht . antarctica has a disc golf course
1339,oh that would be a cold course ! a golf course in dubai requires 4 million gallons of water !
1340,that is a lot of water . the us have more golf courses than the world ambient
1341,i bet . did you know samuel l . jackson lives golf ? he plays twice a week .
1342,never would have thought that . there are bull sharks in one of the water hazards in australia golf course
1343,whoa scary . it is interesting that it does n't utilize a standard playing area .
1344,18 holes a games . seems like a long day .
1345,yeah it does . i like football lab i more . i love the nfl because they have 32 teams so people are bound to find one they like .
1346,yes football is way better . what i true but you usually only hear about a select few .
1347,yes the top ones ew ponder if there will ever be a woman player because there is no rule against it !
1348,male as a kicker . did you know they put tracking chips in hte footbal
1349,oh interesting what is that for ? the also do n't have as musc money as people think .
1350,to track statistics i gues . yeah i heard engineers make ore in their life time
1351,yes they do ! an average nfl game only has actually 11 minutes of gameplay .
1352,matt patricia is a coach but also a rocket scientist !
1353,what a smart man . wow . the cheerleaders i new orleans can not eat with the playersunfair for them !
1354,"hi there , do you enjoy watching football ?"
1355,i do enjoy football . professional but not college so much .
1356,"i stink college games are fun to attend if you 're actually in college and cna do the associated partying , but yes , i agree that pro games are more enjoyable to watch . theres hat 17 week regular season , plug the addition of the the playoffs ."
1357,ye sand with preseason and the superbowl it gets long . did you know that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son 's high school football team ?
1358,"that 's interesting gues it was n't a rap , i doubt the fans would ave been able to stick to that flow haha . musicians want to be athletic and athlete smart to be musicians , so i guess he gets the best of both worlds . type secondbestj to for athletes is commentator , though , like those of a lot of football players ."
1359,i nike noticed that a lot of players go on to be commentators . die you also know that the highest paid department of defense employees are three football coaches of the service branch ?
1360,"that makes sense , i guess , although i doubt they 'll ever make the money that coaches of power 5 schools do or be able to trade up to the nfl . i also doubt that any of heir players go on to then fl , but the average lifetime earnings of an engineer , with a lot of student sat the academies judy , are higher than tha of an average fl player anyway ."
1361,i would certainly take the engineer career path in that case . it would certainly be much easier on your body .
1362,"yes , can you believe that in the 60s top pro bowlers made twice as much asu footballs players ? talk about a job that 's easy on you body !"
1363,"the would be much easier on your body . i ca n't imagine that paying more . , time have changed . were you also aware that 14 of te world 's 25 largest stadiums are american college football team stadiums ?"
1364,"that 's crazy ! although i went to college at florida , so i 'm actually pretty familiar in huge stadium see did you know that the highest scoring football game was a college ketchup whe georgia tech beat cumberland 222 in 1916 ?"
1365,wow ! how is it even possible ; e to score that many points i none game ? !
1366,"i 'm sure it eas n't a fir fight , given how new the game was back then . they definitely did n't have tv for watching , le alone the superimposed y , below first down line created by espn that earned them an emmy ."
1367,i 'm so glad that invented that . did you know that the nfl has tracking chips in players shoulder pads and eh football ?
1368,it 's amazing that they can use technology to analyze the game so precisely . can you imagine if there were chips in golf balls to measure all of those movement metrics ?
1369,neat would be amazing . i do wonder why they do not use these chips when making call instead of relying just on reviews .
1370,"it 's still a game rooted in tradition , i guess , plus someone could probably hack adn manipulate the hahathat 's w can of worms youd o n't want to open ! plus the reviews take up so much of the time ; that ? s part of the experience , and how people speed over 3 hours watching a game in which there are only an average of 11 minutes of live play ."
1371,i suppose so . you mentioned gold earlier . do you enjoy golf ?
1372,"i 've never eve player on a phone course haha . i have terrible hawkeye coordination , m nor the patience to b and good . it also news like a kind of waste of landgolf course in america take up more space than rhode island and delaware combined !"
1373,state is a waste of land . did you also know tat the u . s . has more golf courses than the rest of the world combined ?
1374,"we have a lot of excess , do n't we ? the average american gold course consumes 312 , 000 gallons of water daily , but that 's only the fiction of a course in dubai hat requires more than 4 million gallons . it 's pretty wasteful everywhere ."
1375,that 's horrible and a huge waste . so many go without drinkable water .
1376,"hi , how are you ?"
1377,hi im doing great how about you ?
1378,"i 'm good , thanks for asking . do you like football ?"
1379,"i like watching it sometimes , i guess it depends on ho is palying lol ho about u ?"
1380,"me too , he games can get kind of an to watch . the plots upper bowl i watched was over three ours long ."
1381,"thats so weird , especially since its only 11 min of g , he play"
1382,"i know , it , as me mad , sometimes to think about that . a lot of wasted time standing around . lol"
1383,yeah they take a lot of time outs .
1384,do you have a favorite team ?
1385,"i liek the 49ers , how about you ? did you know in the 60 's top bowlers as almost twice as much as football players ?"
1386,"month ate me , my team i 'the new england patriots . i know a lot of folks despise them , but that 's where 8 grew up . lol i ca n't believe that about bowlers , who watched that ? bowling is like watching paint dry ."
1387,"lol no worries , i do n't follow football religiously , so i wont hate you for your team that cheats lol"
1388,"lol , i we doh ave s lot of good players . one of our former players , running ba benjarvis rene ellis never fumbled in his whole career !"
1389,"i did read about that , very impressive l thats got ta be a record or something . he doesnt play for the patriots anymore though ."
1390,have you heard about th chips she nfl puts in the player 's shoulder pads ?
1391,"yeah i have that really crazy , i had no idea , technology is everywhere lol good idea though to track stats ."
1392,"they also have chips in the balls , too . wonder if they have a searchable database for ap this info ?"
1393,"li , e for the public ?"
1394,"yeah , i think that would be interesting to look at the data for my favorite players ."
1395,"oh i see . hmmm google i t ! that would be interesting to see , or maybe he opponents would use it against them"
1396,"and vice versa , kind of like high tech spying . lol no , they probably keep that data locked up tighter han your bank account info . lolol"
1397,"lol well it would be fair game , if everyone is using it against each other lol its bee agreat talking to you , have a good one ."
1398,do you like watching football ?
1399,i do . i watched the last superbowl on tv .
1400,i did too but mostly just because i wanted to go to a play . i probably wo n't watch football until the next superbowl ; on the first sunday of february of next yea r .
1401,it is nice to be able to talk about it with coworkers and friended . if you now that lifetime earnings of an engineer isp higher thay lifetime earnings of an average nfl player l
1402,"that is surprising . and in the 1960s , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
1403,"i am surprised . football players , top ones , make much more money tha bowlers now ,"
1404,"yeah , people do really love their football . i do n't really , maybe because there ar only about 11 minutes of live gameplay per game ."
1405,americans love nfl games . do you know that it is 32 teams divided equally between nfc and afc ?
1406,"o , i did not know that . football has come a long ay . the technology is awesome . now shoulder pads and balls hasve trackers ."
1407,nfl uses tracking chips o record every move by players .
1408,"the footballs tracks rotation , velocity , ball speed and location . pretty neat ."
1409,"it is not . that way , thet teams can strategize their games ."
1410,he wonder if there will ever be any women playing in the nfl . there are no explicit rules against female players .
1411,"there is no rule but i do not think most women are interested in joining american football teams . this type of football us too physical , unlike soccer ?"
1412,some nfl players have judit incredible talent . rb benjarvus greenellis as never fumbled the football in his nfl career
1413,that is incredible . i need to read more about him .
1414,do you like baseball too ?
1415,"it is the boring to me . i have never watched world tseries , even on tv ."
1416,you are no alone . the women 's world cup had higher tv ratings thin teh world series in the us .
1417,i am glad that i 'm not alone . i reel bad since my bust friend is into it .
1418,"baseball is actually the only port i like to watch , but i thas to be in person . i like the atmosphere ."
1419,"how 's it going , do you follow football , there is a total of 32 teams"
1420,"i dont usually , im more of a baseball fan . its really interesting that women are technical allowed jlo participate though"
1421,"yea , since there is no rule against them playing i can see a female place kicker in the nfl one day"
1422,i bet she would kick butt too . some taht phd sew orleans cheerleaders cant have dinner with an nfl player though
1423,ye tthat rule forbidding cheerleader from the same place as football players is outdated and sexist
1424,u agree . pretty funny taht u of iowa painted their visitor 's locker rom pink though
1425,"yea , iowa must b trying to psych out teh visiting team with hose pink lower rooms lol"
1426,"so i dont know much about football , but the highest game score ever being 222 to zero seem ridicule , louis"
1427,"yea , i know georgia tech is typically a good team but cumberland must have been awful"
1428,"so what do you thin about baseball , its funny that the cubs were the first to win the series back to back but never won again lol"
1429,it 's great to watch with same beer . it 's crazy babe ruth was caught stealing in game 7 of teh 1926 world series
1430,"hey when your down by one run , sometimes you got ta go for it . didnt work well for him though lol"
1431,just seems like a bad decision 6th steal home since babe was n't exactly light on his feet
1432,very true . possibly almost as bad s the marines carrying in the canadian flag episode don
1433,made the us marine corps were trying to get in hte blue jays heads
1434,"ohh , clever ! can you believe the ottoman empire was still a thing when the cubs last won ? i know weve been waiting a while but yesh"
1435,"that 's pretty crazy , you the cubs were the first team to win back kno back world series too"
1436,"it amazes me they ever won at are , they always get so close but not quite there"
1437,"yea , it 's crazy that the al had won more world series thin the nl"
1438,"it is , i 've never heard of it referred to as the fall classic either"
1439,"well i goat o go , nice chatting with yoy"
1440,hello old are you ?
1441,im good how are you or
1442,im good . not feeling well today . unfortunately . just reading about foot ball . you ?
1443,yeah i could n't watch the super bowl it was pretty boring .
1444,im not a huge fan of football . are you a a fan or just watch in passing
1445,have n't been watching myself just the bowl . apparently retire is no written rule that women ca n't play .
1446,i dont think there should be a real that woman cant play .
1447,"i do n't either , sure would chance the dynamic of the game though . would be interesting to say the least ."
1448,i can see where it would get difficult with peoples own morals and much . a lot of men do n't want to hit a woman and then he eis a woman in the field they hav to hit . . . . would be interesting
1449,of course . apparently they have added cracking chip sin the pads of the players .
1450,really ? why did they do that ?
1451,"to track and record droves , soon will be watching drones play the game ."
1452,thats interesting . i bet i ten for like the screen replays where thye use markers
1453,maybe 3d id you know that an average game of has 11 minutes of live game play .
1454,"i did not know taht . what is the rest , ads ?"
1455,not sure probably .
1456,thats ridiculous . did you see the half time this year ?
1457,no i did not watch it .
1458,i think it was very good . i feel like they have lab been blah . teh last good superbowl half time was katy perry
1459,"if you say so , haha ! did you know that the university of iowa 's visiting locker room is painted pink ?"
1460,i stat for breast cancer ? or intimidation ?
1461,intimidation i 'm sure .
1462,i think is funny taht a color can be used for that . . .
1463,"in the 1960 's top bowlers made more tha stop nfl football players , twice as much !"
1464,bowling ! i saw that an it is a bit crazy to think bowlers made money like that
1465,i know right ! nice talking with you .
1466,do youse not football ?
1467,"i love nfl , nd you ?"
1468,"i love football too . i use it play pickup football in my friends or with my family all the time , but not so much anymore . i love watching nfl though ! did you know there 's actually no rule against women playing in the nfl ?"
1469,if htey can play they can play lol
1470,exactly ! only if they can pass the eligibility requirements though . i 'd love to see some women take on tom brady !
1471,the university of iowa visitor locker room is already pink .
1472,true ! i bet it 's to make the opposing team feel emasculated . did you knows hat new orleans cheerleaders ca n't eat in the same restaurant as navy nfl player ? even if they 're already there first . they would and to leave !
1473,what if the nfl player was female then ?
1474,that 's so true . i wonder . . . the us sounds pretty misogynistic anyway . i wonder if there can be a male cheerleader .
1475,did you know espn invented the yellow line ?
1476,"i i n't , but that makes sense . i think they got an emmy for it ! ar n't teh emmy 's for tv shows ? that 's so weird ."
1477,to them it is still q show i guess . in 1916 georgia tech won 22 to zero
1478,"what ? ! taht 's crazy . and since an average game is only 11 minutes in actual live gameplay , that 's especially insane !"
1479,"if i were cumberland , thye losing team , i would have then up by the first quarter !"
1480,exactly ! imagine being in that team and realizing you 're going down in history s the biggest defeat ever !
1481,"in the 60 ; s , pro bowlers made more ethan football players"
1482,"wow , that 's odd . today , engineer make more than the average nfl player over their lifetime . maybe i should invest in some more education !"
1483,i have heard that . i think it is a little misleading because the average nfl career is only 34 years and they still have time to find a career at 24 or 25 years old lol .
1484,"that 's a fair point . do you like teh patriots ? i 'm a big giants far n't i do n't like the patriots or much . did you know that i one of the past super bowls between the giants are the patriots , the giant accidentally scored a touchdown an on the game when they were trying to not score a touchdown ?"
1485,i hate the patriots . that is amazing about the giant . beats hem alleged cheaters every tim e the are the lannisters of the nfl .
1486,"yeah i heard that the author of game of thrones called the that . i hate bill belichick , although he is the ' winningest ' coach in nfl postseason ."
1487,yeah i know . enought is enough . . . i hope he goes back to the browns haha . take care
1488,"yes , back to the browns where he belongs !"
1489,hello
1490,hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .
1491,"that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet ."
1492,what about hte problems witht he ncaa though ? the nfl needs teh player .
1493,"i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players donate ant t play , then they should move along ."
1494,what about the fans thought . people might ge tired of a game when the quality goes down .
1495,"that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their . . . our views are important , but we come and go ."
1496,"i wonder whether letting women ino the game would create interest , get more fans ."
1497,"oh , it absolutely would . it would be like . . . and i know i am doing to butcher then have here , but when manson rehearse played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick ."
1498,"i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true ."
1499,"i feel liek . . . there ars enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver ."
1500,women can be tough too . would a coach like bills belichick hire a woman if she out help him win the super bowl ?
1501,"this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think phone in the front office would l , now at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage ."
1502,"belichick ha done we , l in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch ot social issues and products ."
1503,"oh absolutely . belichik is looking at it from the right angle took . he wants t win , that 's what he is paid for . i think the guy could hire a green martina if he thought it would guarantee an extra td ."
1504,tom brady ad belichick have done well together . i wonder how many would react to a woman in the huddle .
1505,"what a combo those two are . while i 'm hot a huge fan of brady , i dot thinks that he is enough of a professional to be able to start if a scenario like that ever actually took place ."
1506,"i wonder whether the male players would get jealous of the coverage she gets . if there is revenue sharing , teh might not care because they make more"
1507,"i thin , they almost certainly will . it happened i nascar when panics patrick joined . tone after they get used to it , it will gradually get to be a normal thing . they will adapt to it ."
1508,"wow , she is awesome . the violence of the nfl is a bit different though . i wonde if the male players might be hesitant to smash her hard ."
1509,that is true . that is one thing there ill certainly have to adjust to .
1510,"hello , do you watch football ?"
1511,are you a new england patriots fan ?
1512,lol no i am not . did you know there is no written intrude against female players ? women are allowed to play football .
1513,"and sorry , yes i watch football . i am not a fan of the patriots either ! lol i did know about the rule allowing female players . i 'm surprised no females play tho"
1514,george rr martin calls th patriots the lannisters o fooball lol
1515,haha that is hilarious ! i agree with george rr martin ! did you know hat the highest scoring game info football was 2220 ? that blows my mind !
1516,"yeah thats pretty crazy , that is a devastating loss ."
1517,n't certainly is ! i ca n't imagine being the losing team . i was ' fathom any team scoring 222 points tho either !
1518,i how right . i hope they use that game as a training to never suffer tthat embarrassing moment again lol
1519,haha i hope so too ! i 'm surprised tha espn won an emmy for creating the yellow line representing the first do . i had no clue !
1520,taht is cool . i also didnt know that the nfl uses tracking chips on the players
1521,"oh wow , i did n't know that either . it certainly seems like a lot of science and tech are involved in the game ."
1522,"yeah technology has contributed a lot to it , now they have all that fancy stuff on the tv for people at home . they can draw om the screen and light up certain parts . i heard there was once a coach that was w physics teacher ."
1523,"that 's really interesting . nad yea , they can certain ; y do all kinds of things for the viewers at home to see . i 've heard tha nfl engineers make more in their lifetime than the nfl players . that 's hard to believe given how much the players gets paid !"
1524,"i know right . 5ridonkulous amounts of money ! id rather be the engineer , less injuries lol in the 60s bowlers used to make more than nfl football players lol"
1525,"haha yea i rather be the engineer too ! and wow , bowlers ? ! n o way ! haha"
1526,i guess football wasnt very popular back then lol
1527,"i guess . i know m grandparents were very serious bowlers haha hey only brought home trophies , not cash tho 41"
1528,"same here , my grandparents are dig ino bowling , a lot of trophies , m y dad bus in a league but its just for fun"
1529,that 's cool . i always though it was for to go bowling .
1530,"lol well its been good chatting , have a good one ."
1531,do you watch football ?
1532,"sometimes , but there is not much action in a game , only 11 minute , do n't you think ?"
1533,yeah that does n't seem like a long time i think much of the time is taken by ads that makes me angry .
1534,do you1 ike thas other kinds of football ? like soccer or rugby ?
1535,"soccer is my favorite , i also like rugby , what about you ?"
1536,"neither one , the are not televised here i live . i have played soccer when i was young . it was fun . do you watch soccer or play it ?"
1537,"i live to watch it and play it , is football televised , do you have a favorite team ?"
1538,"yeah , i like teh new england patriots , the are the nearest team from here i live . ther ware great even if most people don ' f like them ."
1539,"they are my favorite team so im not one of them lol , the author of game of thrones refer to them as the lannisters of the nfl , thats funny"
1540,"i do n't follow games of thrones , is it a good thing or a bad thing ?"
1541,"its a bad thing , well its the most powerful family on the show but they are cruel ,"
1542,"that is kind of fitbit or them , they are really a football dynasty ."
1543,"they are , they are the team with the most superbowls won but they also share the record for superbowl losses"
1544,how do you think thet will honor bill belichick when he retires ? he is a legendary coach .
1545,"he i s , he is the winningest coach of a postseason , i bet he is in the hall of fame , i hope he stays in thet team for a while more ."
1546,"htey ca n't retire his number , they wo n't name a new stadium in honor , i guess coaches are made to be forgotten ."
1547,"that seems kind i sad , they ar the head of the team after all , a real can be good but i father have a bad coach they will pay terribly ."
1548,"but where is one thing that bothers me with the patriots , in s the names of their stadium , gillette stadium , it is kin da wacky ."
1549,"the stadium should have a better name i agree , it must be really expensive though ,"
1550,"yeah gillette must pay a lot to be associated with the patriots . yet most of the money do n't go to the players , an engineer wil learn more in his life time than he average nfl player ."
1551,"well the might be because an engineer works time as much bears as a football player , but its w suprising stat since football players earn tons of cash"
1552,"how 's it going , do you follow football ? depending on the court ut could refer to rugby or soccer"
1553,love nfl football !
1554,"me too , glad espn invented the yellow first down line for games , makes watching gift so much better"
1555,espn wonde many for that
1556,"yea , tat 's pretty cool . kinda funny that a 3 hour football game only has an average of 11 minutes of gameplay"
1557,i did not know that 14 of the 25 largest stadium belong to college football
1558,"8 concert if the university iowa stadium is on that list , funny enough teh painted the visitor locker room pink"
1559,not that pink i for females only but there is no rule against a fema playing
1560,since theres no rule against female players i wonder if there will b epa female placekicker in the nfl son
1561,i think we would need to use one in college or canandian first .
1562,"i think there was already one in college called cumberland d , they lost to georgia tech 2220"
1563,"wow , lucky for the patriots that happened a long time ago ."
1564,i 'm not a big patriot fan . they are the lannisters of the nfl
1565,"i think they cheated the raiders with the tuck rule , they undefinf , atewdb all , and they recorded others practiced . who knows what else ?"
1566,belichick is considered the coach with the most post season win in history
1567,i did not know belichick coached the browns .
1568,yea and belichick kevin won a postseason gem will the browns
1569,his only other playoff win with another team .
1570,it 's crazy that the bills and patriots have each lost 4 super bowls
1571,all of their wins and losses were by 3 or 4 points too
1572,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
1573,"hello , what 's your favorite football team ?"
1574,hey ! i have always like tune dallas cowboys !
1575,"did you know that the highest score ever in a football game happened in 1916 , when georgia tec defeated cumberland 2220"
1576,holy cow that 's a high score ! ! ! the must have been scoring everytime they touched the ball !
1577,"haha probably , i bet cumberland university will never forget that game"
1578,i bet got . i know i would n't if i played for them . i heard the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player is lower than that of an engineer
1579,"really , that 's interesting . , in addition to that , top bowlers made twice as much s top football stars in the 60 's ."
1580,"football is a fun sport , but with the relatively low pay nad the injury rate , it makes me wonder why people would want to do it ."
1581,"yeah i 'm not sure , did you know that the locker room for visiting football teams is completely pink at the university of iowa ."
1582,hahaha ! now that i hilarious ! what an awesome thing to do ! lol ;
1583,"ahaha it is funny , i will definitely look it up ."
1584,bill belichick is the winningest nfl postseason coach . no wonder with the patriots !
1585,yeah he had 20 wins with the patriots . the author of game of thrones called he new engaged patriots the nfl 's lannisters .
1586,"ewww , incest galore !"
1587,excuse meme ?
1588,"hte lannister reference . . . it 's from game of thrones , and hat family wa sincestual to keep the blood line ' pure '"
1589,"oh ok , its try i did n't understand . the new orleans saints cheerleaders cant ' eat in the same estauratb as fl players ."
1590,"well that 's crazy ! i 'd say it was sexist , bu there isp n't any rule in the nfl that females cant ' play ."
1591,"yeah that 's right , well it 's been nice talking with you ."
1592,you too !
1593,bye
1594,"hi , how are you today ? do you follow football ?"
1595,"i 'm good , thanks for asking . yes , i watch a little football . how about you ?"
1596,"i try to watch playoffs , maybe the super bowl . did you know that and average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?"
1597,"omg , i could swear that last superbowl i watched lasted three hours . so much wasted time !"
1598,"yah , that halftime shaw really stinks up the jon too . the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women would n fact be allowed if they met the elagu'ew eligibility rwquiremnets . can you imagine a woman un the super bowl ?"
1599,"that woudl liken things up , maybe it would n't seem so long , then ? i would watch those linebacker !"
1600,maybe that should be a punishment for someone . they have to play in the nfl against a linebacker .
1601,"that 's a good idea , i think it would be a good deterrent . what do you think te nfl does with all the data they collect from those chips in the players shoulder pads ?"
1602,they probably use ti for strategy . maybe to help predict injuries or something . player safety is important .
1603,"that 's true , try have to know when the have a concussion . i wonder if the chip in the football detected when the new england patriots deflated it in deflategate ?"
1604,"that would be funny . it would detect something , the flight of the ball , its noble , something ."
1605,"lol . i heart he new orleans saint cheerleaders have it pretty rough . they have q rule for they can ? t eat at the same restaurant as any nfl player and if a player does walk in and they are eating their meal , they have to get up and leave ."
1606,the cheerleaders re paid badly and they have to put up with hat crap . maybe the tracking chips could help avoid that situation .
1607,"hey , eberything gets tracked , nowaday i man , t seems like i 've had nothing on my brain the last few weeks but football . how about you ?"
1608,i have n't thought much about sports recently . too busy . plus ne won again . there 's something fishy going on there .
1609,"you think ? lol they have the goat tom brady , you just knew he was going to save the once again !"
1610,the guy is so clutch . i don ' g know how he does its o consistently . i figure bill must understand football better than any other coach .
1611,"belichick is a goat too , f or sure . winningest coach in nfl postseason football . what a matchup , t he stars aligned for that association ."
1612,"yes , quite true . wo n't be anything like that for a while . anyway , great chat !"
1613,"great chatting with you , as well . enjoy the rest of your day ."
1614,have a great day !
1615,you too !
1616,"hi there ! looking forward to chat with you ! ; ,"
1617,do you know much about football ? i do follow the chiefs .
1618,"i love football ! ronaldo , messi and lewandowski are gods ! ; ,"
1619,patrick mahomes rocks ! s o do you thnk nick saban fill go tot he nfl ? he did just win a championship .
1620,"not really familiar with who he is ; , why would n't he go if he is so good ?"
1621,from what i read he is the alabama coach and people are ruoringt hat he could get offered the coaches ' job with the giants
1622,"oh i see . . . coach . . . how ol dis he . . . i wonder if he can even still play ; ,"
1623,no . he has been a coach at alabama foe years . ther ex apparently a big difference between coaching at the college level and coaching in the nfl . college playes here willing to put up with the tigers in order to play in the nfl .
1624,"oh ok . i did n't know that . so that sounds like epa dream come true for him , right ?"
1625,lots of people would jump and the chance and you would think that the pay is a lot more in the pros ?
1626,"am . . i woul ; , is it not ?"
1627,are you a pats fan ? it seems that year after year tom brady is the guy to beat . bill belichick is he the winningest coach in the nfl post season .
1628,"naah , sorry ; , everybody are keep saying tom brady this , tom brady that . . . is he really that good ?"
1629,"i think he has been to the superbowl 10 times an and won 15 afc east titles out of 17 year , pretty good ut he is getting old . i am sure he is due to retire soon ."
1630,"finally , i 'm tired of hearing his name everywhere ; , his wife is a model , right ?"
1631,yes . they are definitely a power couple . do you watch game of thrones ? the author recalled the pats the lannisters of the nfl !
1632,"yeah i 've had that one ; , really funny but what does it mean they always pay their debt ? ; , l ol"
1633,did you know that in the 1960 's bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ?
1634,what ? was bowling that popular then in us ?
1635,it must have been . i am sure tv was not ws big of a deal as it is now . espn won an emmy fdr creating th superimposed first down line . amazing q
1636,"i 've never heard about that ! good for espn ; , hey , it was really nice chatting with you !"
1637,and you also !
1638,love a great day !
1639,"hello , what do you think of female players in the nfl ?"
1640,"hi there , i think it would be great for the league and for girl sin general . how about yu ?"
1641,"i think it woudl i awesome , if they did something about a certain team 's archaic rule . . . of not permittint cheerleaders in the same restaurant as the players ."
1642,"i think i have heard about that rule , it sounds so dumb . i think it is time to have that rule removed to be honest ."
1643,"i do too . the saints should do better , if not for themselves , but for the good of the league ."
1644,yeah ia gore with you on that . do you know that the average actual tim of gameplay is for an average nfl game ?
1645,"somethings ike 10 minutes , right ? i think i heard that when they were talking about the chips in the shoulder pads of the players ."
1646,"neat it 's only 11 minutes of actual gameplay , the rest is spent calling plays and moving chains and stuff . yeah k have heard about that too , very interesting ."
1647,"that is so bizarre , and the time cds n't add up , not if they is 15 minutes per quarter . or is that only highschool ?"
1648,"no thats the real time , the clock runs while all that stuff is going on , so the actual time they are playing is short ."
1649,really ? i never knew that . same with the tracking chips in the balls .
1650,i hope they use game of that tracking technology to help improve player safety .
1651,i would hope so too . i still can not believe espn won an many for that superimposed yellow line .
1652,"taht is pretty wild tha they did , but itd poes hell a lot of making the games more exciting on third down !"
1653,"are you a game of thrones fan ? my son is , and thinks it 's hilarious that the author likeness he patriots to the lannisters ."
1654,"that is hilarious ! i can see that as well , but that is really funny ."
1655,"i want o know who thought it would be a great intimidation move , to aint the u o fifa visitors locker room pink . to me , that is one providing much needed ambiance to your opponents ."
1656,"that is so funny , i guess it calms people one seeing that foot so it makes sense to put it in the opposing teams locker room ."
1657,"maybe thru thought it would annoy the m , lol . it 's interesting , when you realize that top bowlers used to make more than football players ."
1658,"thay is interesting , it 's to show just how big the nfl has gotten since then ."
1659,"i think engineers make more , as well ."
1660,"over the average career they do , i think it takes in account how long the careers are compared to pro sports players ."
1661,"you do have a point . i have to get my kids , thanks for chatting with me . have a great easy ."
1662,hi how are you ' ? football is on the chat menu . do you like football ?
1663,hey there i do like football . i just wish i had seen the game that was the highest scoring football game of all time haha it was 222 to 0 have you heard about this game
1664,was that georgia tech ? what was the coach thinking ? it seems cruel .
1665,yes i agree . id definitely would have quit once it hi 100 to 0 haha . i would have felt so bad to be cumberland that day
1666,i hope the coach put in the third string . it is just mean to bit up a team like that . cumberland should nor have scheduled that game anyway .
1667,no i agree with you . do you like the patriots by the way ? have you heard of benjarvus greenellis ? apparently is never fumbled the ball which i think is awesome !
1668,that is an astonishing felt . i hope hs got a raise or bonus for that .
1669,"yes that is amazing , do you ever watch football on televsion by the way ? apparently esp created 'the line tha shows firs downs when you 're watching football on tv , and even won an emmy for doing what which is cool"
1670,i am used to the superimposed graphics now . i never thought about which station started it all .
1671,yes it was probably a technological achievement back then haha . did you know that females can actually play for the nfl of they qualify ?
1672,"i guess if they are big enough , strong enough , fast enough . . . i wonder if any ill ever try out ."
1673,"yeah i 'm sure we might see a female nfl player someday , why do you think hes take so long on tv yet apparently there is only about the minutes of actual live gameplay lol"
1674,i think that it is the perfect sport for television . lots of time for commercials . lol
1675,"haha i think you 're right but that ! what does make me sad though is tht cheerleaders are not treated well in the nfl , apparently if they are in a restaurant eating and then a player walks and they would have to leave , does n't seem fair"
1676,"yeah , here is sill a lot of sexism in the league . some things manage very slowly m it seems ."
1677,yes i agree . what do you own about the patriots by the way ? were you happy that they won the superbowl this year
1678,"actually , i wanted the otehr team , the underdog , tow in . i am tried f hte patriots winning ."
1679,"haha htey do when a lot . it 's only though , do you ever watch game of thrones ? apparently the author considers the patriots to be the lannisters of ne nfl , adn tune lannisters are the bad guys in that show lol"
1680,"i like got . yeah , the pats are like the lannisters ! lol . anyway , great chat !"
1681,"yes great chat enjoy your night ! and make sure to root for the patriots next yes lol , we want bill belichick to remain the most winningest coach !"
1682,have a good night !
1683,you too ! i ' trying to gop to gillette stadium next time the patriots play again btw
1684,hello do you like football ?
1685,"hi , how are you ? sure , i watch football sometimes . i chat about it more often , it see , s . lol"
1686,"lol i also watch it soekmimes . yes , i am finding out more about it since these info ."
1687,"yes , i have learned more about footbal from tense chats than in ten years of washing football . lol"
1688,did you know in th 10 's top bowlers made more money than football players ?
1689,i think that pro football wwf getting going back then . i bet th players didn even hav epa union then .
1690,"good time for bowlers i guess , and less injuries ."
1691,"yeah , plus a longer career . football players dont have long careers . a bad injury and that is it ."
1692,"yes , i agree . i also found out that when nfl or nba retire 78 percent ego bankrupt within 2 years !"
1693,"that is terrible . these guys really need help managing money . they dont have careers after the league , so they need to survive on this earnings ."
1694,"yeah true , unless they teach maybe ?"
1695,"i guess so of them could get coaching jobs , if they know how to coach . different skill ."
1696,right . maybe sports announcer ? lol still different skill
1697,"yeah , not many o fine jobs . these guys have played spotty their whole lives and dont know anything else ."
1698,"theres a running back who never fumbled the ball in his career , that ie amazing !"
1699,"oh , that guy on the patriots ? yes , that is quite an accpmplishmnet , one for the record books ."
1700,"i know right , i don know much about the patriots but i hear they ar accused off heating , i hope hat guy is both part of it ."
1701,"yeah , the cheating scandals are bad . bil b will never have that down ."
1702,i also hear he puts tom brady on the injured list every eek and hes not even injured .
1703,"bill is crying wolf . trying to trick the other team . wong work . anyway , great chat !"
1704,"great chat , thanks !"
1705,good morning ! do you knw that the nfl has no official rule against female players ?
1706,i have heard that before . i wonder if any one will be able to make the nfl one day .
1707,i wonder . and what it could be the saints ! and they would n't be allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the cheerleaders !
1708,i 'm mo really into nfl . maybe it 's because there are only 1 minutes of live gameplay in each game .
1709,"yes , i 've had the same reaction go it . the days , there are too many ads and too much commentary with not enough action ."
1710,"but old has become so popular over the years . int he 60s , top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
1711,yes ! i wonder why . were both sports televised ? was pay based on live attendance too ? it 's hard to imagine bowling being as popular to watch on tv or as a live spectator .
1712,i believe boating was televised . my dad told me he used to watch it on tv
1713,"fascinating ! well , , it 's still televised . i wonder if the ratings really were higher than for football or if pay was based on something else ."
1714,"but event today , nfl players do n't make as much on average as i would think . engineers earn more over a lifetime ."
1715,"yes , and i'ts interesting to consider the lifetime career of a footbal player . son use their background to transition to other fields such as coaching , or use the income to start a new career after they retire . sadly , others suffer injuries that limit the options hey ahve later on ."
1716,it 's amazing how much technology is used in the nfl these days
1717,"yes , i was reading about the chips that they 're using in shoulder pads . i hope the data they gather that way will be used to prevent injuries ."
1718,and it 's interesting how espn won a emmy for that yellow line they created .
1719,"ye s , just a cell won ! i wonder if an emmy has ever been awarded for something so simple ."
1720,it is very helpful to view football though .
1721,yes . a simple thing can make a huge difference .
1722,"yes , most of the best inventions are very simple . do you like the patriots ?"
1723,"yes ! go pats ! iv ' e never been to gillette stadium , but i 've seen many games on tv ."
1724,bill belichick ahs the mis twins in nfl postseason footballs with the patriots and 1 with the cleveland browns .
1725,yes ! great team ! it 's been good talking to you ! have a great day !
1726,o you watch the nfl ?
1727,nfl ? you mean the national football league ?
1728,"yeah , do you watch it ?"
1729,"televsion was forbidden in my house growing up , so i did not get much chance o watch . what about you ?"
1730,"omg , that is so weird . yeas , of course i do ."
1731,"oh , ok then . i guess we all have different childhoods . the tv is an influence on the mind . what do you like about the nfl football ?"
1732,it ? s interesting tow hatch while you drink beer in a bar .
1733,"oh , ok , it 's an alcoholic event . i see . witht he shouting and cheering and whatnot . do you have a favorite tema or player ? i guess there are a bunch of teams ."
1734,"yup , goo time . of course , the redskins , great team to follow . lots of fun ."
1735,the redskins ? are the names after the native americans ?
1736,"yeah , they are . they have been dc 's team for a long long time ."
1737,why the redskins though ? is n't that a name to mock the american indians ?
1738,why ar theyd and that ? they were named heat before i was born . they were named that 90 years ago i think .
1739,"oh , ok . i thought that a team i washington golf have a very american me , like the patriots or something ."
1740,"nope , they 've been named that for a long time . i 've never followed much of the naming conventions ."
1741,"i see . i guess people choose the same that suits the spirit of the teams or the town . i have never been to washington dc , ut i imagined there must be lots of native peoples there ."
1742,"i ; m not sure , but their baseball team is named the nationals if that hear . i think the patriots are named that because new england was one of te first states , right ?"
1743,i did not know there was a state named new england l i 've heard o new york and new hampshire .
1744,"interesting , i should clarify , so new england is n't a state , it is a region user 'the first settlers were or soemthing like that ;"
1745,"oh , i see . that is the place of the patriots . i think that nfl fooball is an interesting lesson nine mush history ."
1746,"yeah , the nfl is aunt o watch , i really enjoy it . well mice chatting with you !"
1747,i hear the bears may have the highest paid defensive player in the history of the game e .
1748,yes and he is amazing . they have been comparing khal mack to lawrence taylor .
1749,taylor changed the way hte game was played . you thin they has that in him ?
1750,he definitely looked impressive this year it he earned the pay he received . he is the highest paid defensive player in the history of the game now .
1751,did you know that the iowa state universities coach had the visiting football teams locker rooms painted pink . talk about mind games .
1752,"i did not . what a strange thing to do . speaking of football , did you know us in the 1960 's top bowlers made more than top football players ? !"
1753,"wow , drink beer and bowl fro millions , sign em up coach . hey do you know waht the highest scored college game was ."
1754,i do not . what is it ?
1755,wells h encore was 2200 in favor of georgia tech over cumberland .
1756,what ? ! how is a score that high even possible ?
1757,i do n't know but i would not have wanted to be on the us ride home .
1758,no kidding . did you know that espn won an emmy for the creation of he yellow line that marks the first down ? could you imagine not having that on screen ?
1759,"i ca n't they deserved it , that thing mode life mores manageable , lol ! you know the patriots had a rb that never fumbled the football in his career ?"
1760,u did not . that 's amazing . do you remember his name by any chance ?
1761,bneajrvu greenellis former patriot .
1762,"i will have to look into him . i do not remember the name . speaking of the patriots , di do kno taht george rr martin called them ther lannisters of the nfl ? i do n't see that as being a compliment ha ha ."
1763,"wow ! well the patriots have so , thing in common with the buffalo bills they both ave the same number of losses in the super bowl ."
1764,i wow . everyone always talks about their wins but i did realize they were lso tied for losses .
1765,the cleveland browns last playoff game was in 1995 .
1766,they have been awful for a long tiem . chew seem to be better the last year .
1767,"or maybe they need to try out bowling , i heart hat 's a lucrative career , lol ! nice talking with you ."
1768,hi ok are you ? are you a football fan ? i have been discussing football quite a bi recently .
1769,i do n't find . i grew up aw skins far tv you a fan n ?
1770,is sometimes watch games . i try to watch the playoffs and the duped bowl . i like th ebay agreat teams .
1771,not a patriots fan ?
1772,"f they were the underdog in a game , i would root for the . otherwise , no , not real ; y . ?"
1773,george r . r aqmrtin called the patriots the ' lannisters ' of pro football lol .
1774,i guess he thought they were the ad guys ? u wonder .
1775,does that mean the buffalo bills the ' starks ' ? they have had as meant superbowl losses as the patriots have had wins .
1776,"yeah , the bills really have suffered a lot in the superbowl . it must be frustrating to get that fart and lose ."
1777,imagine being the cleveland browns .
1778,howe any times have the browns been tot he superbowl ?
1779,"i do n't think they ever have been actually . the last playoff win was in 1995 , against the patriots ."
1780,that is a shame . i guess the fans must be frustrated . cleveland had lebron for a while though .
1781,"yeah , until la lured him away ."
1782,"he is gettin it the end of his career i think . 34 ie pretty old for basketball . he is a great player , like brady , but eventually everyone leaves the game ."
1783,it 's are . they all get ol s maybe a female qb can replace brady . there is apparently no actual restriction isn the nfl .
1784,"yeah , i dont think the guys writing th rules imagined a day with a woman i nthe game . i wonder if one could ever get to that level ."
1785,"i do n't see why not . officious ha duo stop the lead female cyclist i na recent race because she was overtaking the men 's race . it may not b agreat for long term earnings though , whoever plays . an engineer can actually make more over a lifetime ."
1786,cycling is different from football . usually football requires a lot of muscle amass . cyclist are ususally thin . engineering is the better nice . not nearly so many concussions and injuries .
1787,it makes you wonder ho well they truly fare after they retire . seems like brady as aide football a religious experience almost . want do you do when that 's gone ?
1788,"you adjust to a new life , build new interests , practice new hobbies . i figure that he can be an announcer ? a coach ? anyway , it chat ."
1789,indeed . i you .
1790,"hello , d o you like football ? did you watch the superbowl on sunday ?"
1791,"i am not a fan of football , but i did wathc the super bowl last sunday . it was not what i expected ."
1792,"the game was soo defensive for my taste , im happy because my team won but still i expected the game o be more exiting g ."
1793,were n't they tied during teh 2nd quarter ?
1794,"yeah the game was 33 up till the 3rd quarter i think , then the pats scored a touchdown rand history changed"
1795,i stopped watching it once it wa 33 .
1796,"haha it was towards the end , i know you said your not a football fan but do you have a favorite team ?"
1797,i did not believe that it was their 6th win . i looked it up and their first win was 2002 ! was tom brady in the team by that year ? i hardly saw the rams in the chart winning the super bowl . the team i follow is the 49ers .
1798,"yeah they are the top nfl winners with hte steelers , and im not sure , if e was i don think he was starting qb . but belichick is a great coach though"
1799,"that is insane . well , i have the patriots keep doing what their doing . it 's a iv progress ! maybe , he had a great technique to keep the tema going strong ."
1800,"he sure has a great strategy after all he is the winningest coach in the nfl , that means his doing something wright"
1801,how many wins ?
1802,"he had 21 wins , 20 with the patriots and th remaining witht th browns ,"
1803,he coach 22 team . i see . . .
1804,"yeah , 8 think he coached more teams besides the two , you know the patriots also hold the record for sure bow losses ."
1805,"well , no wonder they won in 2002 !"
1806,"yeah , ive always wanted to visit the gillette stadium , hopefully one day i can watch the patriots play ."
1807,"that stadium is large ! you will one day . all you got to do is get a job and earn all that to save for the next super bowl , if the patriots are in ."
1808,"sounds like a solid plan i wonder how much tiger spare worth though , they must e really expensive , depending on the game at least ."
1809,that is true . it will definitely be expressive .
1810,"yeah buy totally worth it , it also a great chance to know foxborough"
1811,"hi , do you watch nfl ?"
1812,"helo use , i doh ow abou yourself ?"
1813,ye the too . did you know women can play too ?
1814,"i area tthat , i think it is so cool and hold berry cool if a female player did make a team ."
1815,i hope so too . did you know a game hs only 11 minutes of active gameplay ?
1816,is n't that crazy to think that is all ? i guess you do n't really think about it when watching on tv .
1817,right ? we are glued to the tv for hours and 18 old down to only 1 minutes
1818,"right , sometimes for 3 hours or so at a time . did you read about espn inning an emmy ?"
1819,"yeah for the superimposed yellow line e , strange to win an award though"
1820,"it is a bit strange but it makes sense , that me does help a ton when watching the games on tv ."
1821,i guess . did you know they put tracking chips on the payers now ?
1822,"yeah i read that , the game is getting more nad more advanced as it goes ."
1823,yeah for sure . and that weir rule about new orleans cheerleaders ?
1824,yeah that seems like such a silly outdated rule . i think that will be gone in the next yea you two .
1825,i hope so . did you know u of iowa 's locker room for visitors is painted pink ?
1826,"i thinkk hat is hilarious , i wonder who was inc charge over there as aid it wa so to do . i think outs wool ."
1827,yea hi wonder too . did you know bowlers made more than football players in the 60s ?
1828,"is n't that wild , i guess f i could come back again , i would want to , a top bowler in the 60s !"
1829,"yeah for sure , go figure . do you know benjarvis greenellis ?"
1830,yeah is n't he a back that never had a fumble in his career ?
1831,"yeah , that is him . do you know te highest score in a football game ?"
1832,"yeah it was 2220 ! crazy score ! well it was nice talkin do you , i one you have a good night ."
1833,how do you feel about the patriots winning another super bowl ?
1834,i feel let down and aggravated to be honest . it almost makes e want to boycott gillette sine hey sponsor the . how d you feel ?
1835,i hate it because they are so good . belichick is the winningest coach in post season history .
1836,"yeah i know . i ca n't help but wonder if he cheats in some way . on th ironic side though , they patriots are tied with the bills for the most losses at super bowls ."
1837,they are really good at thinkk outside the box . cheating o rinks . htey let the giants score near the end of super bowl 46 so they would have a chance . although it backfired on them
1838,did you know that bill belichick used to coach the the lceveand brown and that their last playoff win was whe name was their coach ?
1839,its his only playoff win not for the patriots . so crazy we could of had a browns dynasty instead
1840,i know . we may still yet if bake mayfield has his way . football is so popular and important that it 's hard to believe that back in the 1960 's bowler made more than football players .
1841,even more surprising is tha 'the average life earnings of an engineer is higher than that of an nfl player
1842,now that is surprising . i always assumed players were among the super rich . i would think that benjarvus greenellis woudl especially be super rich . he has never fumbled the ball in his career and he ? s a running back .
1843,i wonder if hey could use his tracking chips to learn how he never fumbled . that 's very impressive
1844,it really is and surprising . i had no idea until recently that the nfl put tracking chips in players shoulder pads .
1845,it records a lot of stuff ! they even use them in the balls themselves
1846,i 've heard that . i guess that 's how they knew brady was cheating that time . you know they do all of this studying and stuff and in reality a tame only has 121 minutes of qactula game playing .
1847,that 's really crazy . i wonder how much game time th 1916 game between georgia tech and cumberland had
1848,"why , did that name fast a really long time or something ?"
1849,"yes , georgia tech set the highest score ever was 222"
1850,ohh y ! i bet it did go on forever ! what was the other team 's score ?
1851,cumberland did no score . it must have been pretty embarrassing . there should haven even a mercy rule
1852,with that kind of score i definitely agree . i guess cumberland not only had no defense but no offense as well .
1853,hopefully the patriots do n't ever get that good
1854,hello ! do you like football ?
1855,i do . do you ?
1856,"of course ! what 's our favorite team . mine is the new england patriots , the lannisters of the nfl !"
1857,i like the broncos . have you read the indentured by ben strauss nd joe noce ?
1858,"parts of it , i find it interesting that he thinks the nfl has peaked ? want do you think o tthat ?"
1859,"the games longterm survival as z slight favorite , not doomed ."
1860,i hope it 's not doomed . but i would ' twain try kids to play footbal due to all the brain injuries . what 's weird is that average lifetime earnings of an engineer ie higher than the average lifetime earnings of ann fl player and an average mlb played i what do you think could make the game be safer ?
1861,wow i did n't know hat . i do n't kno if they could put more padding in the helmets or not . do you think concussions or broke bones are more common ?
1862,"it seems lke concussions are more frequent and probably underreporte is it certainly seems like a lot of injuries are happening when an average nfl game only ahs 11 minutes of live gameplay . the only real winners are the owners and the nfl corporate entity , don ' y you think ?"
1863,yes . thee are differnt places that call different things foot ball . like what we know as soccer or rugby .
1864,"guy , a american football is so much more high scoring though . in highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 newt hat 's a lot of scoring ! who is the greatest comic in the nfl right now ?"
1865,"i am not sure , did you know snoop dog wrote a fight song for his son 's football team ?"
1866,"i did n't know that ! gill belichick of course . . . he has won the , lost nfl postseason games with 21 wins ."
1867,is he the patriots coach ;
1868,"yes . he is a coaching mastermind . near the end of super bowl 46 , the new york giants tried to avoid scoring a touchdown near the nd of the hamnet avoid to brady an bill belichick outsmarting the . that 's crazy !"
1869,the patriots have either won or lost the super bowl by a points in the 6 tires .
1870,"yep , that 's how consistently good they have been . did you know that new orleans cheer ; leaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant s any nfl player . if they are eating somewhere and an nfl player comes in , they have to leave ."
1871,thats rude . i wonder why ?
1872,they probably do n't want any pr problems from that . it 's kind of weird that there 's no women in the nfl ll other is no written rules against female players .
1873,i heard about a woman trying to go pro last year .
1874,that would be interesting to see when thati happens !
1875,i enjoy football . are you a fan ?
1876,"i enjoy sports . you ca american footbal ; l , with th funny looking 'll ? i 've seen the game ."
1877,yes american football . do you know what teh highest football score ever was ?
1878,the highest score ? i have no idea . who were the teams ?
1879,it was in 1916 between georgia tech and cumberland and the score was 2220 !
1880,that is quite a humiliating score . i wonder why they did that . . seems mean spirited and unsportsmabnlikme .
1881,i agree and i do not even know how it is possible to score that many points in one game . did you also know that in the 60 's bowlers made more than football players ?
1882,i wonder how much money that actually was back then . i guess i missed my window . i was born too late . i have the soul and body of a bowler .
1883,it is certainly a easier sport on your body . grave you heard of benjarvus ellisgreen ? he was a rb for the patriots .
1884,i save not heard of him . i she famous ? what did h redo ?
1885,he played for the patriots and during his time with the team he never fumbled a ball !
1886,that is amazing ? . he must have enormous hands or something gf or special gloves .
1887,it i very impressive . did you know that espn created the line tht shows the first down ? can you imagine watching a game without that ?
1888,"i can not . i thought that it was an obvious thing to do , but i guess espn was the it to do it . good for them ."
1889,it was a great invention go they even on an emmy for it .
1890,that seems a bit much . an award for a line ? i wonder what 's next . hm . would you want to be an engineer ? the average lifetime earnings o an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player
1891,considering that it ; s more i would much prefer it over a football career . it would be much easier on my body nad i 'm not risking injury constantly .
1892,far fewer concussion too . i would rather that women went into engineering . it would be easier on them .
1893,apparently the nfl has no written rules against female players .
1894,that would make or an interesting contest . the fans would e uncomfortable i stink .
1895,i 'm not sur why . t would be difficult for many positions because of the size of the other players but i see no reason why you1 woudl n't have a female kicker .
1896,"hey ! are you a foot , can fan ?"
1897,i am . have you seen khalil mack play ? he 's one of th best linebacker i 've seen since lawrence taylor !
1898,"i dont follow him personally , but i have heard great things abot him ."
1899,"he 's really good , bill belichick and lawrence taylor do n't seem to think he com ; wares to taylor though ."
1900,"taylor is father iconic m maybe overs lime their opinions might change . mack seems to be pretty talented , lets see if he stands the test of time ."
1901,i thunk he will . taylor was a best on the field though . i remember when he broken hoe tehismann 's leg on monday night football .
1902,"wow . i do remember that , but i sounds awful"
1903,"yeah , i think it was an accident , but still ."
1904,"that is some serious power . i can see why there arent female football players , even though there is no rule against them . i wouldnt but to be hit by that ."
1905,"i agree with that . the average football players weigh , what 2025 lbs ? the average woman ca n't of that kind of mass to protect themselves ."
1906,plus they adej't exactly treating cheerleaders equitably .
1907,"yeah , i heard that the saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl played and they even have to leave if w player come in while they 're eating . that is ridiculous !"
1908,"it really is , i wonder what happened to make tat rule ."
1909,"i do n't know , it ' skiier of shady ."
1910,"anyway , did you know bellichick is the winningest coach in post season football , 21 wins !"
1911,"yeah , the 's had 20 with the patriots and 1 wit 'the brown ' has the browns ha da playoff win since him ?"
1912,"probably not . lol . they 're one of those historically bad teams ,"
1913,yeah tobey a . at least my bills are on par with hte patriots . . . in super bowl losses .
1914,"lol l the patriots will litle out do that soon , or maybe they will just win it every year for the rest of time lol"
1915,"its ' possible , i agree with the author of ' a game if thrones , ' they are the lannisters of the nfl ."
1916,lol . nice chat ! have a great day !
1917,"hello , do you enjoy football ?"
1918,i do love football ! how abou troy ?
1919,"yes , i love to go to the games ? what do you think of the patriot s ?"
1920,i like teh patriots ! i 'm glad that they won the super bowl . tom brady puts a lot of work into his game and deserves to be a winner for his dedication to being the best he can be .
1921,"i agree with you ! i love the team too ! ! tom 's plan for a good life is joy , peak performance and avocado icecream !"
1922,so is that from his book ? i have n't read it but am somewhat familiar with it . an interest history tidbit . . . . the cleveland browns last playoff win was in 1995 against the patriot san belichick was the head coach of the browns !
1923,"really , interesting . yeah , i have never tried avocado icecream , thinking if they had enough sugar would be okay ! the patriots have a devoted out of fans !"
1924,i know i would n't like the ice cream because i do n't like avocado . lol i just read that the jackson victory tour played a major role ifr robert kraft buying sullivan stadium and eventually the patriots . i 'm going to ave to look deeper into that .
1925,"oh really , i did n't know tat . in super bowl loses the new england patriots and buffalo bills are the same ."
1926,i did n't know that . what do you think of the tracking chips the nfl has embedded in players shoulder pads and footballs ? wonder if they will help improve the game .
1927,i think its a great idea ! i wonder if it helps with inflated footballs ? lol
1928,lol my first thought was that they could program the chips in the footballs to go tot he othe clips in the shoulder pads .
1929,"lol , thats ' funny ! ! did you know the games of thrones author calls the new england patriots the lannisters of he nfl !"
1930,hahaha i did n't know that ! funny stuff ! do you like snoop dogg ? he wrote a fight song for his sons high school football team !
1931,"no , i did n't know that ? in good ? is n't it interesting ther eis only 11 minute for live gameplay in the nfl !"
1932,is n't that a short amount of tim or a game there teeth out to 3 hours ? i 'm not sure if the song is any got . i know his son is a highly recruited player for college and is really good .
1933,"really , i rid n't kknow that either . i know its crazy how long it takes ."
1934,"14 of the world 's largest stadiums belong to american college football teams . i believe there 's a few that sea tower 100 , 000 !"
1935,i bet at least one of the is in texas ! ! bi football state ! how do you feel about pink locker rooms ? ll
1936,yes it i s ! what 'the saying they have . . . everything is bigger in texas ? lol i 'm not familiar with pink locker rooms ? are they for breast cancer awareness ?
1937,"should be , university of iowa painted the visitors locker room pink ! good chat ! !"
1938,they must have did that to get in the minds of the visiting team . lol i enjoyed the chat !
1939,", ol , i think your right ! ahve a good night !"
1940,you hve a goon it too !
1941,why there do you like the sehaawksb y the way ? i guess richard sherman is bout to become a free agent
1942,i do n't though i remember them winning a super bowl . i am not really into football .
1943,"i old like some of football . i really like the patriots , and i also think it 's interesting how in is split between two conferences , the nfc and the afc"
1944,the seahawks almost beat the patriots in one super bowl but did not ebcayse of a play call a the one yard line .
1945,"yeah that 's pretty crazy . i also think it 's crazy that the nfl does not have a rule against female players , do you think we will ever see a female player ?"
1946,well there is a kicker ho plays on the men 's football team and she just one of our best bets .
1947,"so interesting i did n't know tha . i also did n't know that he average game only lasts about 10 or 11 minutes , the rest is filled with just lining up , commercial , and refs making decisions"
1948,that might be why it does not interest me just . that and i can not follow the ball . the yellow line helps a bit . espn got an emmy for it .
1949,yep that was really smart invention . it wasa shoe a smart invention for the nfl to put tracking chips into their uniforms . that way the can check teh players spared and location in dealt lime
1950,"yeah , so interesting how footbal has progressed , probably because there is so much interest in it . in the 60s taht was not the case as top bowlers , wide twice as much as top football stars ."
1951,you 're right thats ' realy crazy . i should have been a professional bowler because i have a better shot at doing that haha . what do you think about the patriots by the way ? i think i mentioned its my favorite team
1952,i think they are a great team ! bell bellichick is but nfl coach with the most postseason wins
1953,"yep i agree , i love that they play at gillette stadium , i miss the days though when teams played at a stadium named after the city and not one named after a razor lol"
1954,"haha , funny . have you been to the games ?"
1955,"no i ' v never been to an actual , game , but i do watch them on tv , have yo ever seen the show game of thrones by the way ?"
1956,"no , it never caught my attention . is oemtimes watch football on tv but mostly only at super bowl parties on the first sunday in february"
1957,"game of thrones is pretty cool , the only reason i bring it up in because the author says that the patriots are like the lannisters in same of thrones , nad theyd re actually the bad guys lol"
1958,"oh , that is pretty funny . i guess the browns were good at one point . their last playoff win was in 95 against the patriots . their head coach was bil belichick"
1959,yeah he 's a great coach too sure . he 's also the most winningest coach in the nfl postseason . very impressive i think
1960,at the end of super bowl 46 the patriots let the giants score a touchdown and the giants tried to avoid scoring a touchdown . i guess this was to increase their odds of winning . the giants scored a touchdown but won anyway .
1961,"yeah hat was a crazy time . funny too that the last time the cleveland browns on the superbowl was uber bill 's coaching too , he 's amazing"
1962,have you heard of dem bryant ?
1963,"yeah , his a wide receiver might ? it looks like his having a tough time getting a job or maybe he just wants to rest for a while"
1964,"yea h , he was a first round draft pick by the cowboys in 2010 but was cut in april . ouch , that 's got ta hurt ."
1965,"his got impressive carreer thouhg , 53 catches , 73 touchdowns , all in 8 seasons"
1966,"yeah , he says that he still can only the gram ."
1967,"maybe the patriots can sign him , i heard they are having a tough time signing a wide receiver , on that can be edelman replacement when his suspended or injured"
1968,bryant turned down at three year offer from baltimore in th spring because he thought he could get somehting better . i wonder if he regrets that .
1969,"i bet he does right it , baltimore is not the best team but they do alright nad i think the pay is decent , it was a 3 year offer afterall sometimes greediness makes us hand the wrong call ."
1970,you ' r nigh t ! u heard that the browns and the patriots have kicked the tires on bryant .
1971,do it seems like you like to watch footbal are you a fan of any team in particular ?
1972,"no , i do n't like to watch football . i did go to a super bowl party in order to it out on food , ahha . how about you ?"
1973,"lol , w sell superbowl food is great ! and i do like the sport , i like too watch college football ss well , you know the university of iowa has the visitors lockers painted completely ! !"
1974,"hmm , interesting . i guess football does n't really catch my attention becaue here are only 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
1975,"it seems like a lot more though , my favorite team are the patriots , someone called the the lannisters of the nfl , o thought taht was a funny reference"
1976,interesting ! bill belichick has ha teh most wins out of coaches in nfl postseason football with 21 wins .
1977,"yeah , apparently one of them was with the browns , bill belichick is a great coach , he 's the of the main reasons of the team 's success this season"
1978,"yeah , that seems to have bee in 1995 . that was he browns ' last playoff wins ."
1979,"yeah , the pats are the team to have most wild in the superbowl but i didnt kno wthe are alot he team with the most losses ."
1980,"hm , interesting . the patriots play at the age , letter stadium . have you watched a game there ?"
1981,"no i havent , tickets are usually expensive and i prefer to just watch the game from home , its amazing how the team is one of the most successful ones in the histoy of nfl , the team has incredible stats"
1982,"yeah , they are a great team for sure ."
1983,hi buddy ! are you a patriots fan ?
1984,yes i love the patriot u how about you ?
1985,"yes , although i also hold a fondness for the cleveland conscientious objecgors . they rarely show up for a football game . i also like the bills ."
1986,i think pro football would have been better off if the nfl and the afl had not merged in 1966 .
1987,"yeah , but the th emails woudl ot be considered equal to the patriots . . . in number of superbowl losses ."
1988,only bill i know is bill belichick .
1989,"he is the man ! you know , the last time the browns won a playoff game was 1995 . they beat the patriots . and bellicheck wa the coach of cleveland then !"
1990,"that is an interesting factoid , friend . i 've heard some writer guy called the new england patriots the lannister too the nfl ."
1991,nice . i think we should cast peer dinklage as bill belichick in the movie .
1992,only i few wild in the end . did you know that there is no rule that women cant e in the nfl ? they only have to pass eligibility requirements .
1993,"yeah , but the average nfl game is only 11 minutes of playing time . i know , wife would n't qualify because she is never less than 11 minutes late for anything ."
1994,"well , with the average lifetime earning of an engineer being higher than the average lifetime earnings or an nfl player , i 'd say you are better off ."
1995,i would encourage her t be a new orleans cheerleader . that way she would not eb allowed to eat fish th football players .
1996,"hmmm i seem 6th recall they can eat the same thing , just not a true same place ."
1997,"i guess i will all back on plan b : i will install those nfl racking chips in my wifes clothing . tha thay i cant monitor the velocity , rotation , and location like thye n't ; does tc their players ."
1998,sounds like a great plan to me !
1999,"and i hope to superimpose those virtual yellow lines in front of department stores too . i wo n't get an emmy like espn did when they made them for tv , but i will be able to take my wife 's garage ."
2000,excellent plea . did you know that football codes can bet raced back to the modification of football games at english public schools during the nineteenth century ?
2001,"i did not . but i gave up modification as my new years resolution . i was obsessed with it . i used to walk around murdering , ' 2220 , 2220 ' ."
2002,thats ' a sound resolution m just like the patriots superbowl win
2003,"i wish benjarvus ellisgreen had played in that game ! i would have bet that eh woudl othe ave fumbled , since he never did his entire career ! nice chatting with you !"
2004,"u , do you watch nfl ?"
2005,"yea , it 's crazy the seahawks released richard sherman"
2006,yeah that is . did you know women can play too
2007,"o 've heard there is no official rule barring female players in the nfl , i wonder if there will eve robe one"
2008,yeah me too . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
2009,"yea , the saint 's cheerleaders havne't allowed to eat in the same restaurants a omen , pretty unfair"
2010,"very unfair . the worst is , try have to leave mid meal too"
2011,"yea , i wonde why the saints even ahve a cruel forcing their cheerleaders to leave if a player stops in"
2012,i have no idea but pretty sexist if you ask me .
2013,"yea , hopefully they will change that rule soon"
2014,hope so too . now they are using tracking chips on the players
2015,"that 's pretty could , they can find out how hard a player hits and moves with these chips"
2016,"yes , v very handy . do you know what the highes score is in football history ?"
2017,i think it aw a game georgia tech scored 222 points
2018,yeah quite a win there . and espn won an emmy once
2019,yea i head . did you know that the last team hte browns best in the playoffs were then ew england patriots ?
2020,did not know that . buffalo bills are equal to patriot sin losses
2021,not off the top of if head but it makes sense . i kno wthe bills lost 4 super bowls in a row and the patriots have also lost 4 super bowls
2022,yeah ; . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
2023,"he was a running back on the patriots , aparently he has never fumbled a football in his career , crazy"
2024,"yeah , what a talent . nice chat"
2025,do you like football ?
2026,i love n't . do you know what color of the u of iowa visitor locker room ?
2027,yes it is pink but i one why that is
2028,me too . bowlers made more than football players int he 60s
2029,"yes but to be fair , it was a more popular sport uk in the day"
2030,yeah true . do you know what is the highest score in college fothqll game ?
2031,yes that is 220 and who you know who was playing in that game ?
2032,yes that was georgia tech tha bat cumberland in 1916
2033,yeah and tha still holds the record for the highest score
2034,yeah i know . did you know that espn won an emmy once ?
2035,sew thati as for the superimposed yellow line
2036,yes it has made game watching much easier to be honest
2037,yeah . did you know that women can play in the nfl ?
2038,yes as there is no rule against them playing if they qualify
2039,yeah i hope we get to see them in the field at some point
2040,yeah me too . hte gameplay is only 11 minutes anyways
2041,yes and yet we are glued to the tv for hours on end
2042,"i now , so ironic engineers apparently make moe than football players are 'the lifetime"
2043,yes but they have longer careers too so maybe tha tiles
2044,true . did you know they are using chip on the players now to track stuff
2045,"yeah pretty high tech , nice chat today"
2046,are you a fan of the nfl ?
2047,"hi , i watch occasionally . most big gems like super bowl ."
2048,"i didn ' hatch the super bowl i year . the patriots won again , right ?"
2049,"yes they did . the coach belichick is the winningest coach in nl postseason footbal , with 21 wins l 20 of those with the pats ."
2050,"yeah , and they only time the browns have won since 95 was when h was their coach !"
2051,"wow , in ; posing super bowls , the pat sand buffalo bills are tied ."
2052,i thing it 's funny that george rr martin calls the patriots the lannisters of the nfl .
2053,did you know that for pat benjarvus greenellis never fumbled a football in his nfl career ?
2054,"haha , guess you do not think . 's funny . no , i did n't know that . that 's an incredibly cool achievement ! did you know womens an technically play football ?"
2055,"that is pretty cool and i saw he not ? as long as they meet eligibility requirements and want to do it and a team actually picks em . : ,"
2056,"it ? s a pretty sexist industry , so i can understand why a lot of women would n't want to play ."
2057,true but i bet they could do the 11 minutes of live gameplay that the average nfl game has .
2058,"oh , fo sure . i think more women should become engineers ! they 'll make ore money !"
2059,or become like the 1960s top bowlers who made 2x as much as top football stars .
2060,"haha , well then women will have to be tim travelers . it sucks to be a female cheerleader for the saints , though . they have to leave a restaurant if a saints pale walks in ."
2061,yea that does ! i think they have to leave if an nfl player from any team is in the restaurant . like how do you know al lol players . is that even possible ?
2062,that 's even worse . how sexism t !
2063,yeah that 's a weird rule . somethings st have happened for that role o come about .
2064,"i ca n't imagine anything happening that warranted forcing the women to leave even the male players . why would n't they have the players just not sit down ? the cheerleaders literally have to get up midmeal and slave ? anway , this has been a fun chat ."
2065,same here ? i liek that the univ of iowa has a pink locker room for their visiting football teams . how rude ! lol
2066,"yeah , i guess . i think pink can be a powerful color ! haha . have a good one ."
2067,"hello ! are you a big football fan ? : ,"
2068,"hi there , i am a fan , but not a huge fan , i do follow my team closely though . how about you ?"
2069,i used to be more into it when i was younger . i lived in louisiana for a while so its funny they brought up the saints . what ' sour team ?
2070,"i am from wisconsin , so i follow the packers , we did n't even make the playoffs this year , wo disappointing ."
2071,"i bet ! the packers fans seem tomb e really into football , very dedicated to their tema . have you been to any of or college games ? i 've passed by the super dome so louisiana ."
2072,"i have been to a few games , and i have been to louisiana and saw mathews upper doe as well . i would like to go back there now that i am older ."
2073,"that would be fun ! it 's crazy to think about ho many people have been o that super dome , tom brady has probably been there a bunch ."
2074,yeah i know he has won a few games there . did you know he was picked 19th back in the 2000 nfl draft ?
2075,"i did not ! he 's been around for a while , 'm surprised he has n't retired yet . his history as a football player is impressive . been to the super bowl 8 times with the patriots ."
2076,"yah he sure has , i dont think he will retire or at least two more seasons ."
2077,"wow , he 's trying to a around for a while . i do n't blame him though , i kind of wish peyton manning stayed around for a while longer , i liked him ."
2078,"yeah he was a really good quarterback as well , i thought eh as pretty funny as we ; l ."
2079,something that was funny to me while reading this particles i thati om brady has never eaten a strawberry before lol i wonder what 's so scary about a strawberry
2080,"thaat is insane , i do n't know how to can be as old as he is and note at a strawberry ."
2081,"yeah , a lot of weird things about food in these articles actually . it said in the factual section 2 that new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in teh same restaurant ass any nfl player , if an fl player comes into the restaurant they have to leave . that 's crazy ."
2082,"that is crazy , that rule seems so outdated and silly . imagine a cheerleader getting up nad behaving ."
2083,"that would be sad , if i wa sa cehereader and had to leave i would at least wath ti finish mgm lol first . double standards really ."
2084,yeah it really is double standard and that type of thing is old and not normal anymore .
2085,"maybe in 2019 they 'll change that . i 've heard that cheerleaders o n't make very much money either , which is a shame because they put a lot of work into keeping their bodies pretty much perfect ."
2086,neat that is also a shame when you consider how much players make .
2087,wel it 's been nice talking to you ! i hope the rest now your day goes well !
2088,"same here , i hope you have a good night ."
2089,hell ! so do you follow football ?
2090,"hi ! i do occasionally , usually during it games like super bore ; ."
2091,"me too , i really do n't watch much but i do like footbal ; o . i think tom brady is an excellent quarterback ."
2092,"i agree , though he is now in his 40s born in august 1977 . wonder if he might retire soon ?"
2093,"hmmm , good question . he has done so much andc considered the best quarterback of all time , so maybe . i think he is due some tiem to have some fun the rest of his life ! the nfl probably wo n't want him to retire at time soon , lol . . . . . ."
2094,"not if they are smart . he is one of only 2 players in nfl history to have won 5 super bowls . well , i guess it would be 6 no w ."
2095,right ? i bet he has more time before he moves on . football woudl not be the same for awhile . but as a football players retire another one comes along .
2096,"that is true . he wont be easy to forget though especially to pats favs . eh has qb 'd them to 8 super bowls , the most of any player in history ."
2097,"ow , o did n't know tha to i like the patriot 's . but you are right they will never be the same . just like another pat 's player , benjarvus green ellis . . . . never tumbled a football his entire nfl career ."
2098,"yeah that ' amazing . hey , did you realize that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live game play ?"
2099,"it does ? that is crazy ! the same seems to last a very long time , but they do stop a lot . kinda crazy , just like how an engineer makes more money in their lifetime than an nfl player , but nfl players probably work fewer years than an engineer ."
2100,yeah and engineering requires a lot of knowledge and schooling . back in the 60 's top bowlers made 2x as much s top football players . that is very surprising to me .
2101,"wow . ; . that is nuts ! never would think that lol , maybe the next big star will be a female since the nfl have no written rules against female as long as all requirements hard met . ya never know l ."
2102,"that would be different . maybe they could get a pink locker room like the univ of iowa has for its visiting football teams . : , so bad ! !"
2103,"haha , right ! that is crazy . it 's not any differnt than the crazy high score frame ethan ended with 20 that 's unbelievable !"
2104,yeah stat was awful for the losing team i bet . they probably could have benefited from are tracking chips they use today i nthe payers ' shoulder pads to record their moves . maybe could have figured out that they wee doing wrong g .
2105,"exactly ! good point l did you know tom brady 's wife make more than twice the amount of money that tom does ? ? he could definitely retire hahaa , that a lot of money !"
2106,yeah but very few has her body and talents so alas they play fooball or work regular ole jobs . lol
2107,"hahaha , i do n't even know what she does but wow , that 's still a lot of money ."
2108,"she 's a brazilian model , victoria 's secret , many one of the biggest paid in the world . she and brady face a pretty good team though both deserve what they work hard for ."
2109,"oh , ok . i did n't know that , she must be great ti be the highest paid model ! just like her husband ! great team and marriage i 'm sur . hopefully tom brady will stay in the nfl fo , few more years ! we need great players . it has been great chatting ! you have a great evening ! ! !"
2110,"hi , l do you like football ?"
2111,"i love the sport , do you have as favorite team ? afc or nfc ?"
2112,nfc and the bars . you ?
2113,afc nad teh ew england patriots
2114,nice ! you 've read a great run lately then . did you celebrate heir sb win ?
2115,"no , not really , bill belichick got served , that is a sure thing but other than that i have no idea"
2116,i thought bill had a great game plan . he limited the offensive genius to line 3 points .
2117,"yeah the game was a bit boring though , i though tit was going to have ore action in it"
2118,it wares boring but bil usually wins the boring ones . there is only 1 minute of play so maybe that is why .
2119,"i guess better to win in a boring way than to lose in an existing form , and 11 minutes do n't seem like much"
2120,"yeah , aa a bears fan , i just wan twins ! i could use like a decade of them like you guys ."
2121,"yeah we have been pretty lucky and then theres also brady , his a good luck charm"
2122,"i know , plus he 's ready ! i mean , that 's a good looking dude ."
2123,"i ahve to give it to him , grea wath ; the and also has a smoking hot wife so he has just about everything in life"
2124,do n't you kind of hate those guys ? good at everything and has everything ? at least i abe eaten strawberries !
2125,"i kind of do , i wish i had a both part of what he has or evenly yes lol , nad that is weird , how can he not like strawberries or even try them"
2126,"going back to his youth , eh never had a strawberry ? if not , he is seriously missing out . i had a strawberry protein shake this morning , made wit real strawberries !"
2127,"strawberries are so tasty , i could n't live without them . he has a good td pass record though ."
2128,"yeah , i remember that randy moss season with 50 tds a it was magical !"
2129,and prior to that season he never threw 30 td passes in a season so yeah magical
2130,"it was nice chatting with you , have a great day !"
2131,"hello , how much do you know about football ?"
2132,"i know a bit , it crazy how an average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
2133,"yes it is , so i did't know they had microchips in the shoulder pads and ball ."
2134,"i didn knot that either , what are the microchips in thos areas for ?"
2135,thee are placed there to track the movement of players and statistics of the ball like velocity .
2136,"its interesting how technology has advanced , they must be pretty strong in order to handle the lamarr ."
2137,yeah that ' for sure . i really though that players earned alot more money though .
2138,"maybe the mvp busta n engineer wall earn more money than the nfl player , i think soccer players are paid better"
2139,crazy the think that on team scored 222 points in a game once too .
2140,"really ? what team was that , the other team must have been less skilled"
2141,georgia tech adn i agree especially when the other am scored 0 .
2142,"that must be the worst defeat in football history , what do you think about tom brady ?"
2143,i personally do n't like him but i respect his talent for winning so many superbowls .
2144,"he is really talented , he threw 50 touchdown passes in 2007 , what team are you a fan of ?"
2145,"i 'm a san francisco far n , i wish they had wo nine their last superbowl appearance ."
2146,when was their last superbowl appearance ?
2147,"2012 or 2014 i ca n't remember , i do n't pay that much attention to sports ."
2148,"i see , well i ma a patriots fan , did you know that a former rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled in his entire nfl career ?"
2149,no i did n't know that . that has to be a record that only he has .
2150,i think he is teh sole holder of the record .
2151,"i cant believe in thee 100 's , bowlers made more than football stars ."
2152,"stat i really may , i cant imagine bowlers earning more tha nthe lowest paid football player ."
2153,do you think tom brady is really ready to retire ?
2154,i do n't kow . the consensus among the experts seen to be that he 'll keep playing .
2155,"why is that ? his wife makes a ton of money , too ."
2156,"yeah , and he ? s been spending a lot of time on his charity work . football does n't seem to be his main priority ."
2157,"yet , he continues . his buddy gronk may also retire ."
2158,"yes , i heard that too ."
2159,"with three kids and a supermodel wife , why the a chance on getting permanently hurt ?"
2160,"right , and here an talking about wanting to be there for him family more ."
2161,plus hs training ' gurls ' guerrero was kicked off the patriots ' campus .
2162,"yes , and that 's caused swore tensions within the team ."
2163,i think the pats made a mistake trading away jimmy garoppolo .
2164,ye s ! i agree !
2165,he is doing very well in sf . . . when he is n't hurt .
2166,did you know taht the nfl has ho written rude against female players ? womans only in fact be allowed if they me 'the league 's eligibility requirements .
2167,"a few women have played in col ; leage , mainly in noncontact positions ."
2168,i didn ot know that ! i wonder how many have tried out for the nfl .
2169,i do n't think any have tried . it would have been big news .
2170,yeah . i wonder if it will ever happen .
2171,"my son 's modified grade 8 has a girl playing the offensive line . she was actualy the smallest lineman , but played with great technique and was fearless , she was well respected ."
2172,that 's awesome ! good for your son 's team !
2173,"it was great talking to you , have a great day ."
2174,free you a rams fan ? the rams and saints get together really showed off their bills with the saints winnings 455
2175,"i 'm not a rams fan , they switch cities way too often for my taste ."
2176,michael throats form teh saints made a 72 yard touchdown pass with just less than 4 minutes to play
2177,"i how that , that is pretty amazing . the game pitted a young couch that was only 32 versus a 54 year old coach , pretty crazy the age differentiate tenure ."
2178,"yes , semi , mesh fresh ideas . hope to see some females in the league someday . where is no rule against it if they meet the league 's eligibility ."
2179,merle football players are fairly common in his school in the u . s .
2180,"we may see some the . however , some alarming rules in the nfl make me wonder . new orleans saints cheerleaders are n't allowed duo eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player and have to leave a diner if ann fl player comes in after"
2181,"trait is a fairly standard rule with nfl teams , t he washington redskins cheerleaders arent allowed to fratenrize with the players either ."
2182,if you were to watch an nfl game it would only have 11 minutes of live gameplay on average .
2183,"i watch football every weekend . that is probably accurate , i 'm surprised that it is 11 minutes at all to be honest ."
2184,if you want a job that marks more in a lifetime than an average fl player or mlb player you can become an engineer
2185,"i saw that , i it probably because there a bunch of players taht last only a year or so . i 'm not surprised , engineers make a lot of money ."
2186,if you were a bowler in the 1960 's yiu civil have made twice as much as top football stars soo .
2187,"i not , it quite popular in the 1960s ."
2188,one upset football game in football wasa ink 91 when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 . i wonde why they shamed the team so much ?
2189,i saw that . i did n't know that tom brady was listed on the injury report every week .
2190,i did n't know that . it seems strange you can do that . tom brady has never thrown 30 touchdown passes in a season before 007 then he threw 50 that year .
2191,"i know , he 's a great quarterback . i 'm surprised he ' x never eaten a strawberry in his life ."
2192,maybe he is forced about allergies ? a lot of peole are allergic . his wife actually makes mores han double i salary . the must have a little bit of money .
2193,that could be so . i had never thought about that to be honest .
2194,"as the person writing article section 2 says , i also like being the underdog and going for the win . have a goo day !"
2195,"hi , do you watch football ?"
2196,i sure do . did ou watch tom brady 's rec9rdsettting superbowl performance ?
2197,i did . do n't you think it i funny there is only 11 minutes of gameplay
2198,"yeah , and most of that is predictable . the only uses racking chips in equipment and balls to monitor everything , and all of this for 11 minutes of game . . ."
2199,i kow . i wonder what info they collect wit those
2200,"bala speeds , player location , etc . they also probably track played of the field too . in new orelasn , thee cheerleaders are not allowed to dine with the players . how would they know unless they track them ?"
2201,yeah and hte worst part is that the have to leave mid meal of the players come in
2202,"nfl as no written rule against female players , but do n't let the eat together !"
2203,i know that just does not make sense at all . i wonder why they do that
2204,the nfl can ' brush it under the table in a player beats up a cheerleader . they have to be on the field together 'the it week . sad ol but tomb brady 's wide is a model and she makes more money that he does !
2205,i know right ? and engineers make more money than the players anyways
2206,brady makes way too much and his wife makes way way too much . but they is it that i think engineers make just enough ?
2207,i know does not make sense . at least engineers contribute something agreat to the world
2208,"this discussion is above my pay grade , and woudl take a genus to figure out . i know , let 's ask bill belichick ! he knows everything ! he even lists radio on the injury report every week , and yet brady does n't even know he is injured !"
2209,hahaha true . did you know brad has ever eaten a strawberry ?
2210,"he has made it to the top of his profession , married land of the hottest ladies in the world , is largely considered one of the greatest qbs of all time , but he can not handle a strawberry . that is his achilles heel !"
2211,hahaa maye . i wonder wy though .
2212,why has n't the bills changed their team name veto the buffalo strawberries ? the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room pink to gain advantage . wy ca n't the bills paint theirs strawberrycolored ?
2213,hahaha i wonder . do you know what the highest score in football is ?
2214,"era , that would be the georgia tech rushing of cumberland , 2220 . ouch ."
2215,i know i wonder how they felt after that
2216,probably like the 1960s era to paid football players felt when they learned that teh made half wht the bowlers made . ouch !
2217,"hi , do you like football ?"
2218,yes i enjoy the game . i like the nfl even though there 's only 11 minutes alive gameplay .
2219,that seems short . do you know there is no rule against females playing ?
2220,yes as long as they meet the league 's eligibility requirements they can play ! i would like to see a girl play .
2221,"they can not eat in the same place eas the payers , at least the saints cheerleaders ."
2222,that is a weird rule . how dud they enforce the rules of the cheerleaders being required to leave ?
2223,asked politely ? i sould e upset if i were a cheerleader ! like i would lose all of my inhibitions and just hook up with a player at her restaurant . that 's a little demeaning . . .
2224,yes hat 's a very good point . maybe the nfl tracks cheerleaders just like it tracks players movements on the field .
2225,i really hope no t ! rthat'sr really disturbing ! kinda stalkers .
2226,"yes it woul be i 'm sure they do n't do that . although they do track the balls to measure velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location ."
2227,that makes sense to me . it would be helpful in assessing the qbs .
2228,yes it definitely would be . i wonder what tom brady 's football stats are like ? he is definitely one of the best as he is 5 super bowls .
2229,he ' b in pretty good ! all time great ! do you have a favorite team ?
2230,definitely not the patriots lol ! what about you ? tom brady has never eaten a strabwery and his entire life . he is missing out .
2231,i am a bears fan . i do n't mind teh pats . . .
2232,oh chicago has a dedicate far base for sure . soldier field would be a fun place to watch a game . before 2007 tom brady had never thrown 30 touchdown passes in a season .
2233,then he got randy moss and blew that out of the water !
2234,yup real talk ! tom brady 's wife makes double her husband salary !
2235,i would be really happy if my wife made double what ti make . that would b great !
2236,yes me too . maybe some day . . . i also find it funny brady was drafted in the 6th round in 2000 .
2237,talent evaluators missed that one ! nice chatting with you !
2238,i heard that rob gronkowski might be leaving the patriots .
2239,"wow , is it because gronk is such a carefree , happy guy ?"
2240,"will , i think he been a great player but he 's had a rough few seasons due to his health ."
2241,"oh , that 's true . do do n't think he 's played all 16 games for a long time !"
2242,yeah since like 2001 i in ! but i 'm sure belichick will make the best decision as it coach .
2243,"hear , i 'm not a huge fan of the patriots , but i admit that belichick know what he 's doing . besides , robert kraft has said a lot of admirable stings about gronkowski ."
2244,sea and about belichick too he called hi mothe greatest coach i the history of coaching . that 's a pretty big compliment .
2245,"he is , but i guess it does n't hurt to ave tim brady on the team . geez , i think of 's one o only two nfl players to win 5 super bowls !"
2246,wow ! oi did n't realize that there were only two . he 's married t gisele bundchen right ?
2247,"in all honesty tough , l i do think it 's a great story that he was picked 199th in the draft , but he never lost faith in himself and ended bing on of the greatest quarterbacks of all time !"
2248,that is really unbelievable about the draft . the patriots go two lucky . he 's had the most super bowl appearances of any player in history !
2249,i know ! and brady won the super bowl in the first year he ws a starter !
2250,was n't the only other quarterback to do that kurt warner ?
2251,i think ou 're right ! you know what else is crazy ? six of tom brady 's super bowls were decided by 3 or 4 points !
2252,wow ! those are lose blame use do you know if he won any championships when he played college football for the university of michigan ?
2253,"i think eh was on the bench when michigan won the rose bowl and championship , about a lot of people still think he was the biggest steal in the history soft hen fl !"
2254,well i guess he and gronk hae made some pretty big impact on the patriots .
2255,"yeah , i think it 's safe to say brady wo n't be shown the door liken y law , richard seymour , randy moss and chandler jones !"
2256,"yesh , fred ! the patriots have n't been one of the greatest teams in the nfl because belichick help on to players for too long , at least ."
2257,"yep . the guy makes a lot of tough even , and is n't sentimental about his roster . even after resign last yea r , i stil ithink they have a shot again this year ."
2258,"absolutely ! no matter what you think about the patriots , belichick is excellent at putting together an awardwinning roster ."
2259,"all true ! i guess belichick has the footballs noweldge and expertise that no one else has ! they 're still in first place . . . again , so you never know !"
2260,"yes , they are definitely going forward !"
2261,do you like football ?
2262,sure . you mean american football ?
2263,"yes , i forget how football is really soccer to most people"
2264,soccer is a popular sport around te word . fooball is gaining popularity too in other countries .
2265,"i think internationally soccer is the most popular . in the us , football generally is more popular"
2266,"yes , i would says o . americans love the gladiatorial contest of football ."
2267,do you like american football ?
2268,"i so like it , but i do n't watch it often . i sometimes watch the super bowl ."
2269,the perfo0rmacne of the last superbowl was a bit disappointing
2270,"i did not watch it this year , but that is what i heard . a slow game ."
2271,"regardless , i like the patriots since they are like the lannisters of football"
2272,"that is funny ! the lannisters . evil incarnate ! i usually root for the underdog , the long shot ."
2273,"i mean despite their arrogance and reputation , it is hard to dispute the results and the talented players like to brady int he team"
2274,"yes , the talent is there , on the coaching staff too . though i have heard accusations for cheating ."
2275,"yes and while i am not familiar enough to know the details , which team has n't been accused as such"
2276,i really do n't know . i figure ethan th cost of getting caught cheating would be pretty high . didnt ' they have to psy a fine or something ?
2277,that i 'm not sure if the cheating accusations were validate .
2278,"oh , ok . j guess that when a team wins a lot , people wil accuse them of cheating . that makes sense ."
2279,do you have any favorite team ?
2280,"no , i do n't . i follow around the playoffs because the energy is it . i do n't have time to really follow a team through the season . anyway , great chat !"
2281,the same to you . thanks for your time .
2282,are you sa fan of tom brady ?
2283,"i do n't really watch football , but i have heard of him . it 's interesting that he may be playing that part of his it out ."
2284,i believe eh is the greatest qb of a ; ll time
2285,"i have heard that rom otehr people as well . it sounds like the patriots owe him a lot . obviously , i do n't think he can stay on top forever ."
2286,critics did n't believe he was in to play this season .
2287,it sounds luke he had some problems with his trainer and that could have taken a toll on the rest of the team .
2288,"yeah , thats why i am less sure he will play next season ."
2289,i denver realized he was married 5o gisele bundchen .
2290,yea andc hey have a couple of children together . they recently went on a charity trip to qatar .
2291,apparently she makes twice what he does in salary . they are doing quite well .
2292,oh yeah . it kind eh makes quit a bit more in endorsements though
2293,"i do n't know a lot of football , but it 's pretty interesting the highly scoring game ever was in 1916 ."
2294,"yeah , cumberland was a real small school and got embarrassed for all of history ."
2295,i bet so . 2220 is quite shameful !
2296,did you know that espn has actually won an emmy for their coverage of nfl games ?
2297,i did ! i heard they first created the yellow line that is superimposed on th field .
2298,they should have done n oscar for that . lol . i wonder if they will win again for the field goal kicking line ?
2299,i am sure they will be technology in sports today makes me . i never knew the nfl tracks players on the wield with chips .
2300,i think they use the data to improve safety of the game
2301,that makes sense . they also use the in footballs to track the specific options of those too .
2302,i am happy that the super bowl is in a couple od week .
2303,i am not a big fan of hte patriots generally .
2304,i think the patriots cheat a lot . would belichick trade his best players thouhg ?
2305,"i agree that they cheat a lot , i do n't trust anyone on that team . i think belichick would trade then , he does n't care about anybody or anything ."
2306,where do you think rob gronkowski win need u ? do you think he was to stay with the pats ?
2307,i do n't know much about him . maybe he 'll be more successful with a different team atmosphere .
2308,how much money can he get though ? h ewoks well . the pats . a change might make him less effective ?
2309,"i agree , moneywise he 'd be successful with the pats . he seems like he cares a lot about atmosphere and attitude though . do players oven leave for those reason or stay where they are n't appreciated ? i 'm not too familiar ."
2310,i think they 'll trade some money for job satisfaction . probably get a bonus based on performance to reduce risk for the team .
2311,"interesting . i suppose with the nfl , t here 's enough money to go around . i 'm not a big fan of the nfl 's greed ."
2312,they get paid pretty well for only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game .
2313,"that 's very true . not like ' footablol ' in the rest of the world , soccer , where the run for hours and hours ."
2314,i 've heard that there are tracking chips in the players ' shoulder pads and in the ball .
2315,"that seems like something out o on scifi novel , i would n't want a chip in my shoulder ."
2316,i think they put it in the pads . they could pit a chip in the locker calls nad the players shoes .
2317,oh that makes much more sense . do you watch this super bowl every year in february ?
2318,i try to watch it . i 'm hoping that they add moment o the game soon . make it more interesting .
2319,"yes that woudl be interesting to see , although they did n't handle the kaepernick situation well so i 'm not sure how they 'd handle women . i 'd like to see a female coach ."
2320,women in coaching positions is certainly possible . they 've got women in the announcers ' both . they can be on the sidelines too .
2321,"cds m hopefully it is more odrmal9ized soon . irma lapd at lease niners are earning more tha football players , maybe things ar improving ."
2322,we need engineers more than we need crowne e playing with a ball . it 's hard to become an engineer .
2323,"i agree , society values sports and celebrities too much ."
2324,great chat ! thanks !
2325,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
2326,use i do and yo ? snoop dogg once wrote a song for his school 's team
2327,nice . u of iowa ; painted the visitor locker room pink
2328,hmm i wonde it that is supposed to have some impact on them
2329,i wonder to . di you know bowlers made more money think nfl players in the 60s ?
2330,well i guess it makes sense since football was not that popular back then
2331,yeah true . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
2332,yes it was when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220
2333,yeah i bet you they still drag about that even though it was in 1916
2334,yeah bart was . did you know hard is a high school football stadium in texas that can not 18000 people ?
2335,ow how much did that cost ? and for a high school ?
2336,"yeah it cost a whooping 60 million , that is very expensive"
2337,yeah do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
2338,"oh yeah the man is a legend , never fumbled the ball"
2339,ya . did you know women can play in the nfl ?
2340,"yeah other is no written rule if they quality , they can play"
2341,"yeah i hope we get hem in the field soon , after all the game on lasts or 11 minutes"
2342,yeah i know and yet we are glued t thet v for hours waiting for it to an
2343,"i know , so strange . did you know engineers make more money than nfl players in their lifetime ?"
2344,yeah i guess it makes sense since they have longer careers as well
2345,good point . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
2346,do you like to watch football ?
2347,i love it . i am a huge patriots fan including gronk and brady
2348,tom brady is one of only two players in the history of the nfl to have won five super bowls .
2349,i think gronk is considering retirement over being traded .
2350,it is surprising to think that gronkowski would be traded since he i every important to the offense
2351,i think the injuries are catching uo ton im and affecting his play on the field and bellichick seent hat
2352,and apparently belichick has a history of saying abruptly goodbye to certain players .
2353,i ca n't imagine seeing him on way in another uniform
2354,me either . it looks like belichick 's position is fixed . the owner has said that he can coach the patriots as long as he wants to .
2355,bellichick 's prior gutsy moves pale in comparison to a move that may include gronk or brady
2356,belichick does n't give players the same security as owner robot kraft has given him . i can imagine a lot of people will be upset if he gets rid of gronkowski or brady .
2357,"since teh salary cap , bellichick has mastered his roster andc year year by year"
2358,gronkowski has had health issues over hte years and that is probably being taken unto consideration .
2359,"agreed , missing as many game sas hoe has each year hurts his soon , as a player"
2360,"opposing teams hate getting matched with him when he is fit enough , making grim indispensable som times ."
2361,i do n't think you can question his competitiveness when he is on the field . he is a fierce competitor and is hows easily to everyone who watches im each week on the field
2362,that is true . but is demeanor is carefree compared to the rthlessness of belichick and brady .
2363,bellichick is given the freedom to make arguably decisions bout the roster . kraft does not question his decisions at all
2364,"yes , it seems hat kraft reall trusty him ."
2365,"i hope they can grab another super bowl this year . if not , i do n't think we will see another one with this trio"
2366,i hope you do too .
2367,do you like to watch american football ?
2368,"hello , yes . i watch it but i do n't follow it . how about you ?"
2369,i follow the colleges i attended . i was surprised to learn tthat the u . of iowa has a pink locker room for the visiting team .
2370,"yeah , i guess its some kind of scary tactic ? in th 10 's top bowlers made almost twice as much as football players !"
2371,don ' f know . . . that 's amazing . i graduated from georgia tech and never knew they bert cumberland 2220 in 1916 .
2372,"that is a huge defeat , icy a n't imagine losing by that much . did you know theres a running back that played for the patriots who never fumbled the all in his career ?"
2373,"yeah , mr . even . . . i am grateful to espn for the yellow 1st down line . it makes up for some of their political stunts . . ."
2374,"oh really , like that ?"
2375,seriously ? you must at watch it . too much to mention here . google politics at espn . you 'll get any hits . do you watch the nfl ?
2376,"i only really watch when the 49ers play , so no i do no follow football ike i mentioned ."
2377,i 'm a chiefs ca . i liked montana . did you know that the actual average gameplay in teh nfl is only 11 minutes ?
2378,"yeah thats pretty crazy , 11 min stuffed up to stretch into li . hours lol"
2379,"i played in hs and there was a lot of standing around . they are putting chips in everything . now in shoulder pads to track information , e . g . , velocity and location , ."
2380,yeah i hear they put them in teh football as well !
2381,"nerds ! ! ! i am a donner engineer and supposedly , in time , i 'll make as much s an nfl pro . . . still waiting for that . . ."
2382,"awesome ! good luck ! i totally believe that will happen , and you can n't have to constantly get injured to do it lol"
2383,"i don ' k now , paper cuts are help and i 'm in constant danger of training a finger on a reluctant keyboard . tom brady , like him or not , is an amazing qb . 30 td passes in 007 ."
2384,"ah i see , so they struggle is real as an engineer lol im not a fan of the patriots , but i guess hes a good qb from what i hear ."
2385,i 'm having to rethink hi since he 's never eaten a strawberry in his entire life . c'mon not even a taste ?
2386,"lo ; i think he has now . it was recently though , i saw it pop up on facebook ."
2387,thanks for the chat ! you were great !
2388,do you know anything about the pro football hall of fame ?
2389,"only slightly . why , . what 's up ?"
2390,just curious . biden reading about a lewis and cannon .
2391,oh yeah ! the name ray lewis rings a bell ! have you read anything interesting about him ?
2392,h read an emotional story brough his mother during his induction .
2393,"aw , that 's sweet ! what happened to his mother ? do you know ?"
2394,"i believe she is still alive . he told stories of growing up in poverty and how this moment was ' momma , we made it ! '"
2395,"oh that is so heartbreaking ons heartwarming at the same i , e ! i remember when e is now ! he guy that got inducted into the pro football hall of fame ! it 's so touching to see someone speaking of their mojtera s he did in his speech !"
2396,are you a fan of the 32 teams i enter nfl ? any particular one ?
2397,i 'm not really a big fan of any of them . i guess if i had to choose i 'd like the seahawks because i love seattle ! haha . does that count ? and do you ave a favorite team ?
2398,"i likd the nee orleans saints , even though their cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player r ."
2399,"oh i 've heard about that ! can you believe if one of te saints cheerleaders is eating in any restaurant and an fl player comes in , she has to get up and leave ? what is going on with that ! it 's terrible !"
2400,i wonder if the rule would apply if there were ref female nfl player . i do n't believe there is any gender rule in the league .
2401,"hope ! i 've heard that if a female made certain qualifications , then she could 100 percent join the nfl ! i mean , it kind of tempos ne to try it !"
2402,"one or two might work , cumberland lost 2220 in 1916 ."
2403,"oh wow , that is quite the loss ! i 've never heard about that game enforce ! here is a fun thing i was reading about that 's very related ! those big american flags are football stadiums weigh 1 , 100 pounds and cost 50 , 000 to make ! what a waste of money ! that money would really help so many people !"
2404,"well , times , people and things change . in the 1960 's , football stars made half as much as top bowlers !"
2405,"o hawks ! i 've ever bowled , ever in my left ? i wonder how much they make today compared to one another . hey do you like any country music ? i like some , like dolly parton . i was just reading about how country music was inspired by celtic music . i think that 's neat !"
2406,"that is very cool , although it is a little sad there are only two african americans in the country music hall of fame ."
2407,absolutely . i 've heard that country music used to be called ' hillbilly ' music ! good thing they changed the name ! i thin kit wa connie b . gay who coined he actual term ' country music ' .
2408,now many people love it ! even rock stars u2 opened for themselves as the dalton brothers from galveston texas !
2409,"o that is so cool ! what a unique things to do ! opening for yourself as another band ! very interesting ! h , haha ! did you hear about a 1996 album called ' nfl country ' ? lol players snag along with country music stars . i 'd love to hear taht !"
2410,pretty call . i think i will go see if it is on amazon . need to help out george strait 's cousin !
2411,haha . yeah if we like listening to some dolly parton now . it was great chatting i you !
2412,no problem . i thin to 'm going the othe play and will listen to som jazz urban decadence !
2413,"i love watching hte 32 teams in the nfl , although the super bowl yesterday as a disappointment"
2414,"i enjoy watching , too . i thought the game yesterday was a very good defensive game ; but i was not for the patriots to win again ."
2415,yes the patriots win too much . did you know that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ? yesterday seemed like even less
2416,"yes , that is crazy , burt witch all the time outs and tie running ebtwee plays i guess that is possible . it certainly is hard o the body but i guess it is a goal for many guys who end up recognized in the hall of fame ."
2417,"yes it i shards on your body l even with all the money they earn , they have less lifetime earnings than an engineer"
2418,"really ? wow . i guess the difference is in the number of years one can play . did you know that if a woman wants to play , she can if she meets hte regulation requirements ?"
2419,that is great ! i like not being sexist unlike the new orleans saints shih make their cheerleaders leave a restaurant if a player comes in .
2420,i wonder if that is to limit fraternization between them for the professionalism factor .
2421,possibly . the nfl likes to track things they put tracking chips in player shoulder pads !
2422,that is remarkable . that might be he the announcers are able to being their comments so quickly regarding details of the action and records being broken .
2423,yes htey even put the tracking chips in the football i could see that being useful for determining first downs and such
2424,"footbal has become a science , and i love it . i 'm been to the football hall of fame in cannon , oh , and it 's amazing to be reminded of all the good old guys who developed his sport into an american icon ."
2425,yes the hall of a would be interesting to visit . tom brady will certainly end up there after a he has done .
2426,"oh , yes . i enjoy listening to some of their speeches nd to see where their really hearts acre . ray lewis of the baltimore ravens spoke about th need for our nation tomb become more loving and accepting of one another . he made a lot of credit to his mom for is success ."
2427,thet is an awesome speech . i have never heard them give a speech . i tend t not listen tc want it listen to celebrities drone on . though i do some listening to people sing country music is my favorite .
2428,"me , too . now that 's music that brings people together . george strait is one of the best , and actually related to jeff bezos ."
2429,i did not know that . i found it funny that u2 opened shows fort themselves dressed inc costumes and wigs and played country music !
2430,really ! that is funny . i wonder if people recognized the similarity .
2431,i have no idea ! lots of famous people liked country music . henry ford even helped finance country music because he was afraid of the decadence of jazz .
2432,i did n't think he was interested in country music . i usually think of the southern influence in country .
2433,yes these are a lot or different styles . i love bluegrass aww sell the banjos are awesome !
2434,"many styles . i kind of like the country sound of today that reminds me more of teh music of the 60 's ad 70 's . may , it was nice talking with you . thanks ."
2435,yes th 440 's made great music . simple ballads and dance tunes .
2436,"why here , d o you watch the nfl ?"
2437,"i do . i just watched tom brady win the superb owl again , t he first sunday in february ."
2438,cool . how was the game . i understand there is only 11 minutes of playtime but the game itself is really long
2439,this was a very boring he . perhaps if they had had ome women players that is allowed in the nfl it would ahve been more interesting
2440,yeah i wonder why there are no women players considering they are allowed to play
2441,new orleans probably would not want them they do not even allow their cheerleaders to eat at he same restaurant as the players .
2442,"or even worse , if the player walks in nad hey are eating they ahve to leave"
2443,that is great crazy . they probably track the cbeereladers like they do the football during the game with tracking chips
2444,yeah at least i am sure they use the chips i nthe padding for better things live tracking movement nd statistics
2445,it is funny bowling is a less athletic lost but they used to make twice as much as football players
2446,i think thy now get paid more bum not al of them
2447,yes that is true . espn probably got more from winning an emmy fo the creation of the virtual yellow line
2448,unbelievable really . did you know the u of iowa locker room is painted phd ?
2449,yeah tat is pretty funny . i wondr if the loch room of cumberland was when they were defeated 2220
2450,"true , they must have been very sad to be beat buys tech a huge loss"
2451,yes tey could halse used the patriot 's yellowish e has never fumbled the football in th nfl even once
2452,"that is so amazing , the entire career . do you listen to music much ?"
2453,i love country music is origins in folk an cdnluegrass ar emmy favorite
2454,nice . did you know george strait and jeff bezo spare cousins ?
2455,that is funny . i winder if he gets a good deal on amazon music ? country is them it listened to genre during the evening commute
2456,"yea , people like henry ford might eb partially responsible for that too . nice chatting with you"
2457,"you by chance a football fan ? i 'm not the biggest follow the , but i do find some of the stuff about it pretty fascinating . for instance , i find it funny the university of iowa ha saints their visitors looker room pink . guess it 's their way of trying to psych out 'the other team ."
2458,i watch football in the fall .
2459,"oh neat ! you see , i dunno if it would still hold up today , bt they did an experiment a few decades back where they put weight lifters in a pink room and they found the could n't lift as much ."
2460,interesting . i 've never heard of that . is that why it i think ? so they are cheaters ?
2461,"gues they 're hoping it 'll make the visiting team feel ' weaker ' . do you think a woman could be a football player ? you know , technically , the nfl has no rule against it ."
2462,"interesting , but if they have scientific evidence saying item cakes the other team weaker , is n't that behaving ?"
2463,"well , you could say it 's orally creation , but dunno , if there 's no officials he against what color the locker room is painted than i do n't think you could flag them for it . . ."
2464,seems like cheating . they do n't paint their own locker room pink right ?
2465,i do n't know m but i would assume it 's a ' neutral ' colors .
2466,ya . did you know in the 60s bowler made more than nfl stars ?
2467,"yeah , i 've heard about that ! i think back then they had a lot of tv shows nad even celebrity bowling and stuff . ca n't see it being that popular today ."
2468,"yeah , it seems weird . reminds me of the bill murray movie kingpin . lol"
2469,"oh , yeah , that was a good film ! do you know that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay ? hard to believe when ou think of how long they are . . ."
2470,i can believe it . mostly commercials wand play calling ? .
2471,"got some crazy rules about player or cheerleader interactions too . this one team gas a rule if a cheerleader is at a restaurant and a player shows up , they have to leave the restaurant , even if they 're not for eating ."
2472,"yah , i thin tv lot of teams actually have that . i kow the redskins do too ."
2473,guess they 're real strict o nthe whole ' no fraternizing ' rule . probably a cya measure . . .
2474,"am , i think so . apparently the nfl uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads too ."
2475,"yeah , that probably helps keep track of things an ideally up player stats , like passes and distance traveled nd whatever they wan otto keep track of . i 'm told there 's also a chip in the hall for similar reasons ."
2476,"yeah , you have 5o wonder if they even really analyze that data ? well , nice chatting with you !"
2477,"hey . , you too ! have a great day !"
2478,are you a football fan ?
2479,"hi , yes i love football . what about yo ?"
2480,"i 'm a season ticket holder or my alma mater , the lsu tigers . and , i follow the saints in the nfl . it was interesting to see a female ref in the nfl playoffs . d you trink we will ever see a nfl female p ; layer ?"
2481,i was hoping teh saints would make it to the super bowl this year . i think we might see a woman kicker . what do you think ?
2482,"i agree . they would likely breakup through a position with less physical contact . what i find unusual in the nfl are the ' off the field plus ' . did you know the saint 's ba their cheelkreaders from eating in the same restaurant as ah nfl player , even if they were there first ?"
2483,"i did not know that , but i think other teams have similar yule switch the players and the cheerleaders ."
2484,what are your thoughts of technology in fooball ? it seems like they have tracking chips on the players and the balls ?
2485,"i dying it 's a great idea to hopefully reduce injuries a i saw the chips tracks ball speed , location , velocity , and rotation ."
2486,"i could also see it be a good qb , and other players , training id . i do no twitch much tv football ; just not the same s being there . but when i do , i like the yellow line that indicates 1st down . did you know espn won an emmy for that ?"
2487,i did not know that . did you know the average nfl game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
2488,"i did not know that nor what it means . does it mean and for a televised game , only 11 minutes are actually ive and not delayed broadcast ?"
2489,i think only 11 minutes o 'the game are actual playing . so the other time is spent on huddles andc play calling and things like that .
2490,ok . perhaps so . did you follow ray lewis 2018 induction into the nfl hall of fame ?
2491,i did not know that . did you know how painted the opposing team locker room pink ?
2492,"i wonder if that was for humiliation , intimidation , or a bit of both ? ray lewis was a threat on the field wb ut in hi shall of fame speech , he was ike a preached on fire with a 33 minute monologue !"
2493,i did n't lkhno2 that . was n't he charged with murder at one point and time and got away with it ?
2494,i am not the . but i do know his speech was passionate about braking down boundaries and for sports heroes to build legacy bigger than sports and contributing to the community .
2495,he 's don a lot for the nfl . did you know greenellis went his entire nfl career without fumbling the ball ?
2496,"i di not know that . what i found interesting about the nfl induction sis that country music star tucker bastard wrote a special song about his grandfather , bobby beathard 's induction into the nfl hall . of ca a are you a fan of country music ?"
2497,"wow that 's cool . ye s , i like country . what about you ?"
2498,i like the older stuff l much of the newer stuff is like pop music . george strait s more my style . did you know he adn amazon 's jeff bezos are cousins ?
2499,"i love george strait and the 's really cool . well , it was good talkin do you !"
2500,"hello , let 's discuss football ."
2501,can you believe brady 's jv high school football coal refused at play him ?
2502,really ? why ? i have n't heard about that . . i adore italian a serie when i was a teenager
2503,who us your favorite qb ?
2504,"alejandro nest , i also liked paula martini rand fracnesco motto lol . . btw have you heard that espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games ?"
2505,"yes , it was pretty ingenious . now they have the field now attempt line too right ?"
2506,"i ca n't even imagine lol and also the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 , i was shocked , how is that even possible"
2507,i find it funny that the visitor 's locker room at iowa university was painted pink . . . lol

2553,"it is for psychology purposes ; . it is a calming color . i love some drama shows like house , you ?"
2554,"oh interesting . house is awesome because of hugh laurie . makes sense he makes 700 , 000 per episode ."
2555,that was so much money per episode . he had the show awesome for sure !
2556,yes no doubt about that . he is the highest paid actor for any tv drama 2

2567,"that 's an understatement ! i mean , i know h qb is a important position , but losing one player like that should n't make the team crumble ."
2568,"true , nut he was iconic , hat do liu think out the patriots ?"
2569,"i ; m tied of them . it 's a great example of how a good team cna make a quarterback look amazing . but , take away evern a couple of his targets , and brady really starts to faster . the sun was true with iii . as soon as they told him to stop running , his game collapsed because he did n't have the team supporting the rest of the play ."
2570,"i think a lo of other people feel that same way , including myself . apparently a former patriot benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball throughout his career ."
2571,"do players really do try their best . for the pay that get , other have no excuse otherwise . but , some of them end up with a good rep likd ethan love time . others just have some bad like and get taken out of it . iii was a good example of that as well . good player , tried hard , did well , but when it came down to puck of play style , he got taken out and alex smith took his spot ."
2572,"you really know your stuff , i like it ! ahha"
2573,"sully , in my once , i 'm on the low end of knowledge for football . some of the people i work with have been huge football fans since his school and more . one came from a texas hs team had ha da stadium bigger than any e had here ."
2574,that cool . i was looking about alex smith and saw where he got his bachelor 's degree in 2 years and then began working on his masters .
2575,"alex smith is one of the hard workers in the league . in addition to education , his own team members comment on just how dedicated he is to the job ."
2576,do you like drama tv hows or movie ?
2577,in ever been us in to dramas . much more of a scifi or fantasy type .
2578,"oh well , the actor hugh laurie from house is the highest paid tv drama , making 700 , 000 an episode ."
2579,"i did enjoy that show at the beginning . but , with most dramas , it went a bit overboard i the stories and just ended up too melodramatic ."
2580,j believe that too . jim carrey actually does n't play in dramas anymore because he feels like they don ' tiring any types of positivity .
2581,"i had heard tat about him , and i like that . it 's much more his style . some people can do multiple genres , h 's not really one . patrick stewart cna , though . he not only does comedy voice overs , eh also teachers drama classes in the uk ."
2582,"i never read , it got into star trek , but he is a wonderful actor in xmen . american dad is good too , but i do n't watch i much ."
2583,"it 's a fun how . short on drama , decent for comedy . and lot of cameos by other actors ."
2584,"i love the alpine roger , he ' hilarious ."
2585,"if you get a chance , they a top at the ville . same comedy style , jist real actors ."
2586,hello ! do you like football ?
2587,um sure . i like football . i don get much chance to watch these days . you ?
2588,"kind of the same situation , but i like the show they much . . i like 'the quarterback position , i think they are he backbone of the team"
2589,qbs are really important . i lke defense . i like smashing the ball carrier .
2590,why that is cool too ! did you know who created to circular huddle ?
2591,"it wawa not created in gags , in the history of that game , by a coach shouted in the minors of time ?"
2592,i found interesting that is was created by a deaf qb
2593,that is great . a deaf player ? i would never have guessed . must have been a great qb .
2594,"i think it a , his name is paul d hubbard . he had to create a way where nobody woulda lee his sign language"
2595,that is a clever way to get the job done . i bet he went a left handed qb thouhg .
2596,i do n't know abou the but being a left handed qb is really being a minority !
2597,"yes , they are a persecuted minority in mt opinion ! only one in the nfl ? ? what i going on ? ;"
2598,"yes you are right ! the eis only one , only one left handed qb in the nfl , his name i kellen moose !"
2599,"he is not deaf , though ."
2600,super special ! ! you know someone who as a player gave importance to education
2601,i but his name is alex something ? let . . . . something ? i forget .
2602,smith ! ! alex smith . . . he got a bachelor 's in 2 years . . that is a record
2603,the man must be a hard working genius ! i be the is a great qb too .
2604,i bet he was a great player in his team ! ! do you know what is the highest core ever in football ?
2605,it was the game between g stand cumberland . it was a trdavesy . a shame display by the gt coach .
2606,wo w ! ! nothing like that has happened ever since ! ! well i find very pleasing talking about sports !
2607,good . i am glad that you enjoyed our chat ! have a good evening !
2608,"you do the same , see you next time"
2609,hey there . you follow college football much ? been hearings abut a notre dame quarterback named i book .
2610,i dont follow football too much . who is it book ?
2611,he 's apparently one of several quarterbacks adn ours dame . california native do seems to be doing real well this season .
2612,the chance to play for notre dame must be great . they love football there .
2613,yeah . i do n't follow football much either bt really loved tha movie guy about the us do wanted to play for notre dame . i 'm a sucker for feel good dramas . you have any favorite dramas ?
2614,"sure . if you like sports films , i guess hoosiers is good . guy is a fun film because it is based on a true story ."
2615,"oooh , il ike hoosiers as well . was that gene hackman in that movie ? i always mix it up with michael caine ."
2616,"yeah , hackman . plus harry dean senator a it was another movie based on a true story ."
2617,"was n't hackman in another football movie ? the replacement ? there seems to be a lot of football movies . ca n't think of a lot of soccer movies , even though that probaby a more popular sport worldwide ."
2618,"ben edit like beckham . there was a film about well too . yeah , there should be more soccer films ."
2619,ah i forgot about those . know of any rugby films ?
2620,"um , there is the one about south africa . invites . matt damn . morgan freeman ."
2621,"wow , you 're pretty good at this . does rugby have quarterbacks ? i figure matt damon would 've played whatever the equivalent to that is ."
2622,"uh , i dont think so . h nwas the captain i believe . some sort of key role , i dont know rub"
2623,"yeah , i do n't know much about it either . just kind of watch highlights on espn . you tune in to espn at all ?"
2624,i dont watch espn too often . maybe if there is a game on that i will make a point of seeing .
2625,i mostly tune in for scores . but i do appreciate espn 's use of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line in football games .
2626,that is a benefit for viewers . it just seems so obvious to add . i guess it took a bit of technology to make it happen .
2627,i think they won an emmy for that . well deserved i think . i have a hard enough time following football as it is so hot line is much appreciated .
2628,"yes , the superimposed graphics do askew it easier to follow . anyway , great chat !"
2629,take care .
2630,hey there do you ever watch football ?
2631,"yes , i watch it a lot . while i 'm from the midwest and still z kc chiefs fan , i like near boston so i live among the whole patriot nation epicenter ."
2632,"ah i see , d id you heat how univ . of iowa painted their visiting teams locker room pink ?"
2633,"yes , i think that kind of funny , i wonder if that was to distract them from their game preparation or make them feel a little soft and feminine ? either way kind of funny i guess . i see where the 3 highest paid department of defense employees are football roaches . that is almost the sam befoe state employees being footbal or basketball coaches , that priority looks a little skewed to me ."
2634,"yes i agree i do n't like that , weird too that in the 60 's bowlers made more than nfl players !"
2635,"yes , adn the average engineer in a lifetime made more than the average nfl or mlb player so i guess there 's some justice in society . i played highschool football , did you ? shocking that allen , texas holds 18 , 000 , though i guess i read football a religion in texas , i 've never been there ."
2636,"no 8 have n't but i want to go , did you hear abou to the football huddle was created ?"
2637,"yes , by a deaf guy so the other team could n't lip read the plays . tha as ironic because now the coaches and everyone hides their lips behind da clipboard or paper . did you see or know brad johnson threw a td to himself ? i assume it was batted in the air andc lame down mn his arms so he ran it i , but i was ' familiar ."
2638,"haha j need to see that video , also cool that one patriots player has never fumbled , i would give him the ball every time !"
2639,"haha , yes , a si said i live near boston , but did n't know that . did you see where both africanamerican qb ' z won superbowls against denver ? ironic there too ."
2640,"that that is ironic , also weird that espn won an emmy for creating the yellow line in football games on tv !"
2641,"yes , did you know russel wilson is turner contract as qb for seattle and the ny yankee 's in baseball ? tha 's a talented an ."
2642,"oh for sure , so i saved smith , he got his bachelors degree in only 2 years !"
2643,"yes , i 'm a kc chiefs fan for the past 20 years and always lived the they , though last year 's understudy patrick mahomes had an mvp year so i wash happy he goat trades , but when he broke his leg , that was painful to watch and i felt for him . did you watch the office a tall , the actor jon hamm taught ellie kemper , erin , as ah highschool drama teacher . small world kind of situation ."
2644,"ow that is interesting , also that ugh laurie gets to much money per episode of house e , 700k !"
2645,"i like that show , it makes me laugh but i didnt realize hugh was paid hat much . wow , did you know patrick stewart teaches hamster classes in drama i the uk too . i guess acting and teaching to apt havne't that far removed from the same skill set ."
2646,"no it seems like it , id you ever like to carrey movies ? its sad he wont do dramatic roles anymore"
2647,"only the truman show which was as much scifi as drama i guess . did you know drama comes from the geek world for action which is derived from the greek work ' i do ' . i guess since aristotle 's poetics was the earliest work of dramatic theory tha make sense to me , does it to you ?"
2648,"ya i need to heard it but it was from 335 bc , thats o long ago ! interesting that he invented the genre !"
2649,"well , he wrote the first theory of drama , there 's probably some cave man a thousand years enforce him trying to tell a story and dancing who really ' invented ' it and then someones old the same story in th cave and passed it on i 'd guess . while on 's high art , my grandmother 's day stopped evey day for afternoon soap operas , did you know they got that name because of the soap womp ; any sponsorship ? that might be considered low art ."
2650,"ha interesting , k love soap but ate operas ! a also there is a website where you cna hear free classic drama and maybe some soaps !"
2651,"hi . dp you watch football ? by that i mean , america football ."
2652,"yes , i do . do you watch it ?"
2653,yes i do . back in 1916 georgia tech scored the most points in a game hen it defeated cumberland . the score was 2220 . wish i could have seen that game !
2654,you 'd think they would have pulled the qb at 6 0 . . . what the stunk rule ?
2655,i do n't know but they should have done something different mls definitely . maybe they just did n't value football ike people do today . back in the sixties bowlers made more than football players .
2656,"wow . i think today , engineers make more than the average football player ."
2657,seriously ? i had no idea they aide that such !
2658,i think . has to do with football players only averaging 2 . 5 years of actual career time .
2659,oh . i imagine good players that last longer make more then . benjarvus greenellis for one . he 's never fumbled the ball in his entire nfl career ;
2660,he was a good running back but he is not other in the nl . he only played in the nfl for 6 years . . .
2661,"six year is okay , surprising thought or his record . did n't he play for the patriots ?"
2662,yes and the bengals . i wonder if he was ever in iowa 's locker room ?
2663,why ? is there something about heir locker room ?
2664,their visitor 's locker room is pink ! i guess it is a psychological ploy . . .
2665,"it must be . i so n't think it works very well though . they are not as good as say , alabama and clemson ."
2666,i know . they do have a nice ritual where they wave to all the kids in the cancer hospitals after the 3rd quarter so we ca n't hate the much !
2667,that is a nice ritual ! espn should shows hat more often well they do it . what did you think of espn winning an emmy btw for tear yellow line ?
2668,i feel like the emmy 's lowered the bar a lot to get them an emmy for that !
2669,it does seem odd but i like the line . it does the game more interesting by knowing just how far a team has to go to get a first down .
2670,i agree . ut is more functional than two old white guys running down the sidelines with two sticks and a lot yard chain .
2671,well it shows the viewers the exact line end ads some drama say on a third and long situation .
2672,when i was a kid i always wanted to be a quarterback and lead my team but it was sadly not to be .
2673,"hey even the greats like tim brady never got to play in high school , so you never know what might happen ."
2674,that 's true . i would have fit in better with the smith though he was so good in school he was working on a masters when he was drafted .
2675,"that is smart , get a good education . too many players go broke , e 5 years after leaving their sport ."
2676,yes the quarterback at oklahoma almost quit football tp compete in gaming
2677,hat doesnt sound like a profitable ventura ep i sm glad he stuck it out .
2678,did you know there is only one left handed q2uartebrack ? it seems like there would be more its an advantage in baseball
2679,"i am sure it would be , would likely throw everyone off . i wonder how many there have been in history ."
2680,i am not sure . i know there was one famous deaf quarterback the huddle was invented for him so he outer teams could not read his signs
2681,it is truly amazing what people come up with that they intend ton out help them that turn out to be iconic .
2682,yes . other teams just do things to be goofy like iowa painting 's visiting team 's locker room pink !
2683,"that must get in their heads , maybe they locker room was pink in the 2220 loss ."
2684,laugh . that is a shellacking . its no wonder bowlers made more money than football players back in the 60s if that was the common game
2685,"that ish a to imagine , i wonder if the pay for bowlers was tthat food or the ay for football was that bad ."
2686,that is a good question wb et they both made less money than espn dick hen they got an emmy for the superimposed yellow line
2687,that yellow line is genius ! i know many people who cant watch live because of that line .
2688,it is used but not needed for folks ; ike greenellis of hte patriots . he has never fumbled in his entire career .
2689,that is pretty impressive l that is probably part of why the patriots ave been one or the most dominant teams recently .
2690,yes the patriots at least made a better decision han his high school since they let tom brady play !
2691,i bet the are really regretting that decision now .
2692,no kidding ! tom has won 4 super bowl
2693,hey there what do you think about virginia tec ? do you think notre dame will beat them
2694,"georgia tech 's my alma mater so i know the ac will . i do n't know , home at va tech can be hard . they have those buy i book ."
2695,european book is really good . he 's thrown about 7 yards and four touchdowns in a second start . very top player i think
2696,"yeah , now i 'm wondering if georgia tech plays notre dame . they are an independent team , no in any conference , . book is from ca and is pretty amazin g ."
2697,yeah he is amazing . who was your favorite quarterback thoug by the way ?
2698,in college ? i liked ryan . georgia tech neon the nat ' l championship in 1990 but i ca n't remember the qb .
2699,"yeah i dont ' remember hime rather . i do lke baker mayfield , h e 's good at video games and he was going to be a professional video game player , i was also good st video gamer back in college lol"
2700,"well , not as likely to get seriously injured it video games . i like nd 's coach solely . he seems to work well with boo it i think something goood will happen there ."
2701,"yep i could see that . to you like alex smith though ? he was about to get his master went he actually got accepted into the draft , he seems like a smart guy"
2702,i actually do n't know much about him other than is smart academically . i did learn that snoop dog did his son 's hs fight song . . .
2703,that is really cool with them . i wonder what it sounds like . did you ever hear about the top scoring football game of will time ?
2704,was n't that georgia tech and cumberland ? i 'm not sure i 'm proud of that . . .
2705,"yes you 're right . i wish we saw that game on television , because it sounds like quite a blow out lol . you like the patriots by the way ?"
2706,i 'm a chiefs fan but like college football better . btw : 14 of the largest 25 stadium in the world . for american college football teams .
2707,"wow thanks impressive ! also impressive is the one patriots player who has never dropped the ball , i think his name is benjarvus greenellis"
2708,that 's amazing . also amazing is qb brad johnson who throw a td to himself i na superbowl .
2709,hes i want to watch that shows ! it sounds incredible what do yu think about a deaf quarterback creating to circular huddle ?
2710,that is interesting . i wonder how he was all to play qb ? admirable . . . do you enjoy watching dramas when you are n't watching football ?
2711,i do like watching dramas . do you think about michael caine ? i think he 's a great actor
2712,i like him a lot . i also like patrick stewart he teaches master drama classes int he uk .
2713,yes patrick stewart fit a good guy . do you like classic radio dramas ? apparently there is a website where you can listen to them for free online
2714,not sure how much longer football will exist in it 's current form .
2715,the game has caused a lot of injury . it is hard to know who is at fault . there are risks . its obvious .
2716,i guess the question is how much the ncaa officials knew about the potential for serious damage and injury ;
2717,they might not have know exactly but they feared the possibility . too much money at stake o stop the game . too much liability to admit fault .
2718,"money , money , money . maybe it 's time to go to flag football ."
2719,"yes , then teh whole thing could be used l i was the players had better representation in college . no one helps thom ."
2720,"yeah , just kids really . i 've got boys but have never encouraged them to play table football . playing i before 12 has a lot of risks ."
2721,sports are important but use do not involve such risk of injury . basketball soccer baseball tennis swimming the list is endless . plenty of ways to compete . youre wise to protect your kids .
2722,"yeah , we 've done swimming , basketball etc ."
2723,"thats not . still , th country is dedicated to gridiron gladiators . 14 of the world ' w 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams ."
2724,it 's a big sports for sure with so much money . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes . live gameplay . lots of commercials in there .
2725,"hte high school football stadium in allen , texas seats 18 , 000 and cost 0 million to build . i guess the pros have similar stadiums . all for 1 minute of gameplay . i wonder if schools will ever get one like that ."
2726,"dunno , the average nfl player does n't make that much money i nthe long run . career spare too short ."
2727,true . plus they dont bow how to manage money . bo control nl financial knowledge . i figure they should get help frost he leagues .
2728,"yeah , they should . financial education is critics . i ' metre of a literature person personally ."
2729,"yes , you would need financial education then if you were a player . why was literature in the olympics ?"
2730,no idea . i guess they were going for a full spread off culture or something it hear about the contest to come up with the worst possible opening sentence in a novel ?
2731,it was a dark and stormy night . suddenly a shot and out . good stuff ! i figure if sold be good at being terrible .
2732,"lol , that would be a lot of fun ."
2733,"comedic fantasy author terry pratchett was knighted for his ' services o literature ' . i wonder what kind of horrible opening lines he could come up with . anyway , . grea chat !"
2734,"dunno , nice talking !"
2735,do you1 ike watching football ?
2736,i love watching it ! how about you ?
2737,i love it also ! do you have a favorite college and nfl team ?
2738,i would have to say out of the 42 year in the nfl the steelers are my favorite .
2739,"nice , i like the vikings . i like the university o flows hawkeyes for college , have you heard of that ?"
2740,i have ! i like how they painted their visitors locker room pink . lol
2741,"right , it is so interesting to see . apparently pain is a calming color and why they do it lol"
2742,i could see that . in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of the day ! times safe sure chanted since then .
2743,"times have changed for sure ! i wonder what the difference is now in salary , his to be a ton"
2744,i be its ' reversed ! do you know what the highest score eve way in a football game ? hint it was in 1916 and georgia tech beat cumberland .
2745,what was he score to that 80 ?
2746,it was actually 2220 . that a blowout .
2747,"no way ! that woul , d be insane . i would have quit football right after the game if i was cumberland k wow !"
2748,lol did you know that espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line on tv ? i had no idea .
2749,"i did not know taht either . i love that line , it is so helpful . i used to think it was real growing up . . . . ."
2750,lol nice ! how about former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis ? he 's never fumbled the ball once during his career !
2751,that is a great feat ! be needs to teach a clinic to these new rbs
2752,"i agree ! what do you think of the tracking chips that they are putting in the players shoulder pads nad footbal , los to track data ?"
2753,i think it is awesome . must be developed by engineers who make more money than players over their life time . it was ice chatting with you !
2754,that 's probably due to their longer careers . did you know that the nfl only has 1 minutes of live gameplay ? i had fun ! thank !
2755,that is amazing ! enjoy your day !
2756,do you like tennis ?
2757,"i love and watch it a lot , and you ?"
2758,nice me too . fo you1 know what the relation of the show to the polo shirts is ?

2760,yes and then the other players just adopted vita nd it beam famous
2761,yeah . did you know only one black man has won the us pen ?
2762,yea in 1968 and no one after hi mj weird
2763,yeah i know . one hey used a helicopter to dry a tennis field
2764,wow desperate times call for desperate resolutions i guess
2765,yeah ike no ? do you know how long the longest game lasted ?
2766,yes that was for three days and a total of 11 hours
2767,"that is so long . new about the nfl , do you watch it ?"
2768,i sure do . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
2769,yes i wonder if it supposed to have ome effect on the opposing team though
2770,i wonder too . bowlers used to make more than football players n the 60s
2771,yes but i guess that wash because bowling was much more popular back then
2772,i guess so . do you know that hte highest score in college football is ?
2773,yes that is 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
2774,yes that was way back in 1916 but quite something still
2775,yeah . did you know when can play in the nfl ?
2776,yes there are not rules against that as long as they qualify
2777,are you a fan of football ?
2778,i 'm w huge football fan . how about yourself ?
2779,"i love football both college and nfl , do you have af favorite nfl team of the 32 ?"
2780,i 'm a new england patriots fan and huge fan of tom brady how about you ?
2781,"nice i am a vikings fan , not doing so hot as of late . i also , the the university of iowa hawkeyes , did you know they paint their opponents locker room pink ?"
2782,"no i did n't know this . did you know that in the 60 's top bowlers made twice as much as he top footbal , l players ?"
2783,"that is crazy to think , i wonder what hte difference ins salary is now , probably substantial"
2784,now there is bo contest football players make way more than bowlers that ' so rule . what do you think about he new rule that was implemented by the nfl ?
2785,which the is that ?
2786,its the rule that a player ca n't lower his helmet and initiated contact with an opposing player .
2787,"that is a good player because of safety concerns , but also was awesome . see back in the day when it was allowed da own do you feel about it"
2788,i ithink it will decrease injuries and i think its a great rule because it protects the football players from serious head injuries .
2789,"for sure , that is a huge problem now . did you kow engineers make more money in the lifetime than nfl players"
2790,i did't know that but its an interesting fact . what year did the nfl and the afl merge ?
2791,"i am not sure , do you know ? was n't trump an owner of an afl team ?"
2792,the merger between the two leagues was completed in 1970 . i 'm not sure if donalds trump was an older of an afl team .
2793,"i think he amy nwas for another league k items like new ones are coming out every year now . being youre a patriots fan , did you like benjarvus green ellis ?"
2794,i loved benjarvus green elis and i read somewhere that he never fumbled in his career .
2795,"right , that is outstanding in my opinion . he needs to teach a clinic to all these new era rbs ! it was so great chatting with god 2"
2796,it was awesome chatting with you as well . you have a nice day ! ! !
2797,you too ! enjoy the weekend !
2798,"how 's it going , do you at the nfl ? a lot of teams like the redskins are upset st the new rules"
2799,"hi there , i watch it from time to time so i am not really up to date with what is going on . i know that their coaches are the highest paid"
2800,i guess there is collusion with whats a penalty and players are getting suspended for it
2801,"oh i see , yeah i guess that can be confusing when you start changing things around after so long"
2802,"yea , apparently players and coaches have been complaining about the new rules ice the preseason"
2803,yeah and they are reasoning stat this i sa contact sport so it is supposed o be tough
2804,that and there find it unfair other players like running backs do n't get in trouble for doing the same thing
2805,yeah exactly . have you ever been to that football stadium in texas that can seat 18 000 people ?
2806,no i never been to texas yet but that 's pretty crazy
2807,"yeah it is right ? and it cost 60 million and on top of ll , it is just a high school stadium"
2808,"they do love football in texas , too bad they do n't care as much about education , an average engineer makes more in a lifetime than the average nfl player"
2809,yeah that is a good point . did you hear they are using tracking chips on the players ?
2810,year hey put teh chips in shoulder pads and the footballs to track speed and stuff
2811,"yea , i wonder if ther eis any way to use what data to make the game safer too and reduce concussions"
2812,hopefully they are . it 's crazy how dangerous the snl is when the is only an average of 11 minutes of live gameplay
2813,"yeah ho figure . matt patricia is the only scientist tha toured football coach , what a change in career"
2814,"yea l , he use to coach for the patriots , i wonder if he gave benjarvus greenellis advice on not fumbling the ball during his nfl career"
2815,"i think that is so amazing that he managed o do that . on another topic , do you go to the library a lot ?"
2816,"sometimes , i never knew here were more libraries than mcdonalds in the us"
2817,ton is a pretty cool fact . a kid in malawi read from books how to build a windmill and managed to build two for his village and brought power in
2818,"well i got to go , it as nice talking with you"
2819,"i am glad to see that the nfl is taking steps to make the sport safer , but some of these rule changes have to be hard on the players"
2820,yes . i agree . especially the rule where a player cannon lower his helmet and initiated contact with an opponent . it all happen so fast to be able to make a split second decision sometimes .
2821,"the players are so used to paying the game one way , it is a lot to ask for them to suddenly change how they play"
2822,i agree . maybe the tracking chips that they are putting in the players shoulder pads will help to develop some new protective measures that will help .
2823,"yes , football has come a long way from the days of leather helmets and no forward passing ."
2824,lol yes it has . i notice that he shoulder pads and protective gear seems to smaller than it was in . the 70s and 80s . the shooter pads are quote a bit safer . i think it 's made the players able to become faster which is part of the problem with some of the vicious hits the players take .
2825,"just like most other sports . athletes of today are bigger , stroker and faster . us all of the focus on nutrition and training ."
2826,true . there is in written rule against female players in the nfl . it makes me wonder if a girl were to make it .
2827,i imagine if they are tough enough ten they 'll get signed on by a tema
2828,dig unless so . lol did you know that the nfl wa actually formed in 1920 as the african professional football association before renaming itself the national football league in 1924 ?
2829,i did not know that . the nfl sounds a lot better than the alpha .
2830,yes it does . lol it was n't though until the nfl merged with the american football league in 1966 that the nfl we know today came to be .
2831,it is similar to basketball . the nba and the a used to be a separate leagues . then they merged u the 1960s or 1970s .
2832,that i did n't know . i do n't follow basketball as close a si follow baseball and football . i know the pay scale has change for the nfl players because in the 1960 's top bowlers of tat era mad twice as much as the nfl players did back then .
2833,i am sure now most nfl players make more in a week than thas top bowlers do .
2834,i 'm sure theyd o . lol the average lifetime earnings of an engineer s higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl or mlb player . probably just because the engineers have longer careers .
2835,i would imagine so . the average nfl career is less than 3 years long . and the guys who only play 3 years or so do not make the higher level salaries
2836,i agree . did you know taht espn won an emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line ? i did ' know that .
2837,no it is hard to imagine watching a game without that line .
2838,i know right ? i just read about ther highest football game ever . it was in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 . wow ! cumberland must have been really really bad .
2839,if i was the coach i would of resigned . no way i could go back in the locker room at tthat one
2840,i . do you watch football ?
2841,"yes well i did watch the superbowl but i do n't watch it regularly no , what about you"
2842,"sometimes , but not every week . i would get bored watching for 17 weeks straight during she regular season and then the playoffs and super bowl ."
2843,"it i boring , there is only about 11 minutes of actual gmaeply in any footbal gram e , that explains why i do n't like him !"
2844,yes ! there was once a game where th score was 2023 to 0 . that must have been a sight to see !
2845,"i think i heard about that game , georgia tech beat cumberland , man i would have given up once it hit 1000 haha"
2846,haha . i ca n't imagine tha happening in the nfl . there 's actually no rule that says females ca n't play in the only . i wonder if that will ever happen .
2847,"jz it wouldnt surprise me , what does surprise me is that player for the patriots , he 's never fumbled the ball , that is crazy !"
2848,he 's goin to feel terrible is that record i ever bone ! i think it 's benjarvus greenellis .
2849,"ya i would worry every game haha , have you seent hat yellow line that appears on tv when watching football ? egot won an emmy for creating that"
2850,stats ' pretty cool . i thought players made a ton of money but apparently engineers make more in a lifetime .
2851,"ya that is shocking to me , also shocking is that the nfl uses tracking chips o get stats on tshirt plates"
2852,"yeah , they ' e in the players shoulder phds ! technology really has advanced in the game !"
2853,how often do you read ? apparently there are more libraries thant here are mcdonals ' . at least in the usa
2854,"not as often as i would like ! i have a library card , m though ."
2855,"yes i have one too , it 's too to know that over half of usa adults have a library card apparently"
2856,"yes , that 's reassuring ! there 's a library in california where you can borrow things like sewing machines that you might only use once . that 's pretty cool !"
2857,"wow that is nice , also i is william gladstone who donated his entire book collection , 32 , 000 books , to his library when he was 8 years old"
2858,"he carried all his books in a wheelbarrow to thiel library , too !"
2859,that is impressive ! equally impressive is the man who was wrongfully imprisoned and sent 10 years studying law to prove his innocence
2860,good ford him ! thanks for chatting ! have a great weekend .
2861,"thanks ou too , keep track of your library card !"
2862,trump and stone knew very well what wikileaks had in their hands with those emails
2863,is that a fact ?
2864,i think the email to bannon back in october proves it .
2865,facet news !
2866,"but a copy of he email sas published by ny times and daily caller , how fake can it be ?"
2867,"haha just as telephone , or phone , is a telecommunications device that permits two or more uses to conduct a conversation when they are too far part to be heard directly , those two rags can perpetuate nonsense . right t ?"
2868,mueller shaw thye evidence as well as hte focus 0 shed the necessary light on the actual truth of th matter
2869,i 'm looking forward tot he conclusion !
2870,the conclusion of collusion . . . lol
2871,i like the rhyme ! did you know the that the last us president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr ?
2872,i did not know that .
2873,o sure and everyone thinks trump is illegitimate president because he did n't get the popular vote but 5 presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote . greatest margin 10 percent !
2874,i would have liked to see the runner up last election be the vp to bring some order to show chaos as o plate .
2875,well sure and i would 've like it to be bill murray because he did voice the human north in the 1970 's fantastic four radio show .
2876,the canadian radio shows hav veto play at least 40 percent on canadian music which means ton sofa justing peer
2877,had he 's not my favorite !
2878,my grandfather once told me a story about how he had made hi firsts audio with only a razorblade and a pencil
2879,is your grandfather macgyver ?
2880,"no , many soldiers during tthat time did the same thing"
2881,"wow ! cool like the fact that one of them is popular radio acts of the 1930s was a ventriloquist , a fact which baffled contemporary critics ."
2882,have you checked out the free classical dramas on teh radio
2883,like old ones or presents day ?
2884,old classical ones
2885,merry christmas ? let ; s finish thugs things so that i can go check them out !
2886,time to listen to my radio
2887,indeed !
2888,"hi , do you listen to the radio ?"
2889,i do in the car . how about yourself ?
2890,yes me too . did you now you can catch jupiter 's storm int . am radio
2891,wow ! that 's amazing . i would love to hear that . i have heard that you can make a radio with rudimentary parts . soldiers in wwii could make one with a razorblade and pencil .
2892,that is amazing . wonder what channels they were able to capture on that though
2893,that 's a good question . there is also a website where you can listen to old radio dramas fot free . i wonder if those are still entertaining ?
2894,i have never listened to one . do you speak any latin ?
2895,i definitely do not . i ad to take media terminology in college and there was a lot of that in there but that 's the extent of my knowledge .
2896,well apparently there is a radio im finland that gives their news in latin
2897,that 's very odd . i a n't imagine wh the audience is for that . off topic but do you happen to know who the top three welathiest s presidents were ?
2898,"i pink it was jfk , washington and jefferson , right ?"
2899,that is correct . do you happen to know if the guest douse nwas built after the white house ?
2900,yes it is and now it is bigger than the white hous
2901,i assume it was since it is bigger . i wonder the that made that decision ?
2902,i am not sure actually . do you use hour one much ?
2903,im mostly text with it . i worked in a call century for a long time and i hate talking on the phone now .
2904,did you ever use a rotary phone ?
2905,i did when i was very young . it 's been a very long time .
2906,yeah that was ages ago . how about a phone book ?
2907,long time for that also . i just look online . did you know that the cables that carry our internet and phone data across the ocean are only 2 . 8 inches around ? !
2908,wow and who knows how long too . nice chatting with you
2909,i hold have to say that the telephone is one of the most important devices ever invented . wher woul the be without telecommunications .
2910,for sure . did you watch the state of the union last night delivered by president trump ? surprisingly he is not one of hte three wealthiest presidents in american history .
2911,"well , his net worth may well be negative . president banana fo zimbabwe probably had more money"
2912,"possibly . jfk , jefferson . and washington certainly had more . they are the three wealthiest presidents in history ."
2913,"well , the president of indonesia ahs done 3 pop albums . that sounds like something up president trump ' valley ."
2914,did you know until 1805 the runner us in the election became vice president . can you imagine trump working with hillary ?
2915,i did not know tha be who would get the guest house ?
2916,"not sure , good question . i now it 's larger than the white house which is ironic ."
2917,"but its not in nyc . so it would take longer to dial it up , at least on a rotary phone ."
2918,"right , because nyc 's area code is 12 . i get it ."
2919,"it doesn ' matter on an iphone though , which is more powerful in some ways that the entire us nuke deterrent system ."
2920,that 's amazing . and all of that computing power dependent on a 2 . 7 inch cable laying across the ocean floor .
2921,"back in teh day , ww2 soldiers could make radios using a razorbaldea nd pencil . they were probably more secure than todays devices ."
2922,"most likely . hard to hack a razor blade i suppose . oi bet those soldiers were strong , but not stronger enought to separate two phone books joined together with overlapped page ."
2923,was helen slave tubman strong though to do that ? she bought 3 radio station . that ; 's impressive .
2924,"yeah , that does sound impressive . i wonder if she ever listened to one of the thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas online ."
2925,is think she preferred nuntii latini .
2926,kinda like canadians prefer canada radio . they require at least 40 percent of the music played to be canadian .
2927,no wonder the president of indonesia could't get any airplay !
2928,either that or he wa n't very good .
2929,he has no president banana .
2930,"that 's for sure . well , pleasure chatting with you ."
2931,some here .
2932,hello . how are you ?
2933,"i 'm doing well , you listen to the radio very much ?"
2934,yes even more so when i am driving
2935,"me too , i 'm surprised that jupiter as radio storms hte can be heard on am radio ."
2936,yes . i wouldnt mind hearing those .
2937,i wonder what they sound like ? waht if it is actually aliens trying to make with us ?
2938,i dont think there sounds are from aliens . but they have picked up sounds from space that make me wonder
2939,"for sure , did you see in canada , 40 percent of the songs played have to be canadian ? that 's pretty wild ."
2940,i am surprised by that
2941,"i 'm sure his will blow you away too , in ww2 , soldiers made simple radios using a razorblade and a pencil ."
2942,i would like to google that to see how thats dine .
2943,"yah , i 'm sure there is a youtube video or too on it . you ever heard of the reason why ny area code is 212 ?"
2944,"no . i should being i hasve dialed it so much in my life , but i dont"
2945,"it 's because it 's the fastest number to dial on the rotary , think about how much i , se god halves caved because of it ."
2946,wow . i never knew that .
2947,"yah , did you know the other word for telephone is a phone ?"
2948,yes . i knew that one .
2949,"do you see unicef donating a day of clean water to a child in need , all you need to o is not use your phone ."
2950,that is a great idea .
2951,"for sure , i wonder how many people do that ? any idea on why you ca n't separate two phonebooks that have their pages over rapped ?"
2952,no . that seems strange .
2953,"what a mystery . anyways , great chatting wit hyou , hole you have w good rest of the day , i 'm goin it go for a walk !"
2954,howdy there . o you like radio ?
2955,"hi ! yes , i do . radio is convenient fot easy abckgrohund noise and is fascinating the ."
2956,it is good for drowning out my wife nad kids when thy are complaining about hunger to i like radio .
2957,3rd you know that canadia radio mandate there be a certain percentage of canadian music played ?
2958,"yes , the canadian radio industry really has it in for foreign bands . they want the airwaves for their own talent . it is nepotism ."
2959,perhaps . there are always other resources though . there is a web page dedicated to classic radio dramas . . . and it ' xstotlaly free !
2960,"dont tell the canadians about it or theyll want 40 percent of it to be canadian . lol . it think its great taht old , outdated things re preserved on the internet ."
2961,right ? not sure which isp or . . . 40 percent canadian . . . or totally in latin like th finnish broadcast 'nuntii latini ' lol
2962,i guess the canadians would want then jews in canandian latin . lol i like the idea of dead languages used or the new s .
2963,"using only dead alnguagse keeps a lot of people from it , and access stop information sould n't be restricted . even in foxholes , soldiers cut off from lost of it world , wheres til ; communicating the new ' and status of theirs current live . . . and they did it ball with a razorblade and a pencil . absolutely mindblowing !"
2964,i guess foxholes ace a crucial that inspires creativity ; . i think its great that they could listen to teh news in latin in a foxhole .
2965,"thank goodness fo 'the telephone then , e h ? high not as convenient as electromagnetic waves , cables on the ocean floor still transfer information as well as personal connection all across the globe ."
2966,the telephone has changed my life for sure . so many telemarketers . . . so many pam calls . i curse the mama who invented he phone
2967,"okay , that 's fair . i do n't know how many numbers i 've had to block due o auto calls and other robotic spam . maybe i should just plain turn it off , i ear there 's a charity that 'll give clean water to kids if you do that ."
2968,i figure that the kids could use the water but can people do without their bloody phones ? the sun could explode and people wouldnt notice unless twitter tolt hem .
2969,you are preaching to the chair ! crazy to think what the world would be like if every phoenix just spoof vanished . why do we need phones that have more computing power than nuclear missile deterrents ? ? its nuts .
2970,"to be fair , the texting is not so good on the nuclear deterrent . plus sometimes it explode . but i hear you . the electronic together is robust ."
2971,"donate et the u 'president find ou tthat as easily as he can use twitter , he can blow stuff up . that 's just a recipe for disaster . too bad he is n't occupied with other hobbies , like presidents from other places on the planet ."
2972,"other hobbies involving pop albums ? i shredder to imagine . anyway , great chat !"
2973,"it would keep things interesting ! haha . ah , yeah . nice to meet you . . . : ,"
2974,his to meet you too . have a good one !
2975,": ,"
2976,"hello ! did you find any of the articles interesting ? i found the one about the radio and the telephone very interesting , as i have a background in technology ."
2977,"yes , i loved learning about radios and telephones . ;"
2978,"i love knowing about those kinds of things . i remember reading recently about a russian radio frequent called ubv76 . it has been broadcasting a signal for over 40 years . in that entire time , it has only stopped date signal a handful of times to broadcast a crypt message ."
2979,it is crazy deciphering crypt messages . have you heard of foxhole radios ?
2980,"i have never heard of them , what are those ?"
2981,soldiers in wwii made simple radios using a razorblade and a pencil !
2982,"wow , that 's really incredible . i would like to try building one myself . it 's crazy that hat the entire intercontinental ballistic missile defense system is less powerful than a iphone ."
2983,i find that hard to believe ! how do they even measure that ?
2984,i 'm not sure . . . other than the computing power . i know that a lot of places still use really old technology . i work in th healthcare industry and still see floppy disks being used for heart research purposes . it 's amazing to see technology that is older than me still in use haha .
2985,that is crazy . i hae never used a floppy disk .
2986,"if to are lucky , you can fit one low quality and on it hahaha . the average song is around 4 to 7 megabyte it van only fit 1 . 44 megabyte ."
2987,wo w ! have you ever head a jupiter radio storms ?
2988,"i have heard of storms on jupiter adore , i didn'fk now that it was powerful tough to be heard on earth . jupiter hs a supermassive hurricane always spinning on the planet . i heard the winds were several andre smiles per your , or kilometers ."
2989,that is crazy ! i wonder what the storms sound like on teh radio .
2990,i might look it up and tune in after this chat haha . how do you feel the president of the united states is doing ?
2991,i am surprised that he is not in the top 3 wealthiest presidents .
2992,"after inflation , i am surprised as well . he comes from a business background , so i was expecting him to be a to make much better decisions . it just goes to show you that politics are a much different beast than business . does your country have a president ?"
2993,i live in the s . ahve you heard about the name of the first presiden do zimbabwe ?
2994,i did not know his name was banana nuntil i read about it !
2995,i wonder if that was his real name or just a nickname ?
2996,it looks like it was his real have . i 'm surprised the indonesia presiden thas te time to make songs in office .
2997,me too ! i am going to go listen to i a it was nice talking to you .
2998,hey . do you enjoy listening to the radio ?
2999,i do . i like it on in the background when i am working or driving .
3000,"nice me too , especially when driving . i occasionally use the am radio but have never picked up a jupiter radio storm ."
3001,"well , there probably is not much playing on jupiter radio anyway so you are n't missing much"
3002,yes very true . im 1989 a finnish radio station began broadcasting a weekly news program in latin ! i wonder how many listneerst hey have ?
3003,i bet it finally gave people who major snl nations something to listen to . so maybe 4 or 5 people ?
3004,yes exactly lol . in canada 40 percent of the music played on the airwaves has to be canadian !
3005,at least canada has som decent bands like barenaked ladies to wild in the music alot
3006,oh i did't know they were canadian ! if you are a radio drama fan there is a website where you can listen to thousands for free .
3007,"i have never listened to drama on there radio , but i do not it was very big , especially in the days before television"
3008,"yes it was basically the big form o entertainment ! i bet some presidents even tune in . the three wealthiest presidents were jfk , washington , and jefferson ."
3009,witht inflation i can see how washington nor jefferson might hack more worth than presiden trump . but jfk surprises me
3010,yes jfk is a bit surprising . i bet the president of indonesia made a lot from his pop albums 2
3011,i wonder if be had time to actualy run the country . recording 3 albums is a long process
3012,yes i agree . i would like to know more but that . uo until 1805 the runner up automatically became the ice president . kind of make sense but it would never work nw !
3013,no it would not . the parties have zach other too much for that to event work
3014,i wish they did n't . just so much more productive to work together . i wonder who has stayed in the presidents guest house ? it is actually bigger tha the white house .
3015,"i bet there are some wild parties there . diplomats , celerbitiesx , presidental mistress , athletes ."
3016,sounds like a good tv show ! or perhaps a radio drama . i wonder if there are a lot of iphones in the white house ? the iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear deterrent ! lovely chatting wth you today !
3017,"well , . they still use floppy disks in the white house , so they might not also a lot of phone usage"
3018,that is so archaic ! probably use those old rotary phones too .
3019,could be . good chatting with you .
3020,do you listen to the radio ?
3021,i do sometimes . a hanson song once became popular because hey would not reveal th artist
3022,wow dig uss people are drawn to mystery . do you listen to am or fm radio ?
3023,"i listen to fm usually and yes , mystery can do some amazing things"
3024,i knows . in the am radio you can get jupiter 's storms
3025,wow nice . the most popular act on the radio in the 30s was the ventriloquist
3026,wow that is interesting for a radio . do you listen to radio dramas ?
3027,"i do n't really , are they good ? maybe i should check them out"
3028,well thee is a free websites of them f you would like to check it out
3029,yah that is nice . did you know that there is a radio station that turns solar energy into tunes
3030,that is so cool . in wwii soldier made foxhole radio using pencils nd razorblades
3031,that is so creative . do you use the phone much ?
3032,all the time . do you know why the is area code is 212 ?
3033,i have no idea abut i know that the inventor of a car phone was an undertaker
3034,oh that is cool . the area code is such because it is easy to dial on a rotary phone
3035,i see dolphins can communicate with each other over the phone and know who is on the other side of the line
3036,"so cool . the radios in canada re required to play 04 percent canadian music , that is the law"
3037,wow that is a bit excessive ? did you know that hey lamarr helped with the invention of the cell phone ?
3038,nice . in finland they hav epa radios station that gives the news in latin
3039,so cool . nice chatting with you
3040,same here hav . great one
3041,hi m do you listen to the radio a lot ? i still think it 's a great form of entertainment despite i'ts age .
3042,"i do , i know its old ca but i love listening to ther did still ."
3043,it 's really interesting that radio waves also occur naturally .
3044,"it is cool , how did we even discover them and got to use them , there 's a real genius behind that invention"
3045,"i believe it 's because they occur naturally that we discovered them , and then late learned how to use them . you can actually pick up radio signals from jupiter at home with a regular am radio when the storms are intense ."
3046,"the radio has a lot of cool facts also that in 1989 a latin news program was dated , i think its still around ."
3047,"i only know some scientific names in latin , bu ti guess listening to that wild be a good way to learn more ."
3048,"it would be a great way , i do n't understand a word of latin but a does sound pike z nice show , theres also a website that has thousands of drama episodes for free ."
3049,"can you download them or i sit just streaming ? i 'll have to check that out for sure . its nice to get , lot in a radio drama wher eyou have to use your imagination , unlike say a tv show ."
3050,"i think you an download to i have no idea , ive just heard about the site recently , must be a lot site though ."
3051,i 'm looking fo it now on my smartphone . did you ever use a rotary phone back in the day ? do you even know what they are ?
3052,"id id one a rotary phone my grandma ha done back in the day , phones have evolved a lot over the years ."
3053,"yes , those things had no computing power , no computer at all ! very primitive electronics . i saw one at s yard sale recently . i have n't used one in decades ."
3054,do you know why the area code of new york is 212 ? its actually because of rotary phone s .
3055,"yes , it 's the fastest code to dial ! actually i looked up rotary phones after seeing one thinking it might be worth something . turns out they are worthless lol ."
3056,"yeah i think they are worthless by now , i prefer smartphones . its insane howe such power an iphone has ."
3057,yes an iphone has more computing power then the us nuclear icbm deterrent . each iphone becomes more powerful then the last and they come out every single year !
3058,"thats amazing right , so much power i 'm pocket , its also kind of scary our nuclear deterrent should be updated asap ."
3059,probably they ca n't take it offline to upgrade . thati only be the only logical reason why they use less computing power then the average person holds in their hat .
3060,"yeah i guess that make sense , still scary . did you hear about the campaign unicef has concerning clean water and children ?"
3061,yes . i saw that but decided i would keep using my phone . i just made a donation for 20 because i could n't do without it ! speaking of phone i need to make a call . it was nice talking to you .
3062,"i think thats ' great , you are contributing i might do the same i ca n't live without my phone , it was great chatting with you as well , he ."
3063,"hi , do you know much about the technical aspects of telephone"
3064,i know that voice in transformed into electrical impulses which are transmitted by cable . cellular phone works by decoding tube data thin transmitting it .
3065,"oh , your explanation is making so much sense . thank you ."
3066,"there is a lot of technical data , like the area code 212 was chosen because it was easier to dial one a rotary phone ."
3067,that fact to me is reasonably because new york was one of the earliest established cities in the u . s history .
3068,"i do n't know about that , since the phone was invented in the late 1800s , there were a few big cities at that time ."
3069,exactly . i find . very amazing that all of the phone and internet data is converted thorough an only 2 . 7 inches in diameter candle across th bottom of the ocean
3070,"yeah , i wonder if they snap from time to time , 2 . 7 inches is not a lot compared to thousands of miles ."
3071,"i agreed its your point there , and i am worrying the same issue . btw , i am wondering that us having a backup device to store these information in case the cable snapped"
3072,they probably designed to system so 1 cruel can be broken but people wo n't notice . like naming 2 kindness .
3073,i concur . having only 1 sidney is sufficient for survival . that is a very good analogy
3074,but those system are getting more complex as phones get more computing power . the iphone is more powerful than the computers built in the 60s .
3075,i am surprised to know about this fact . i do not know what kind of power taht an iphone uses so that much energy is consumed
3076,computers are more efficient so they do n't need as much power as in the 60s . like radios that became smaller in teh 80s and they could invent he walkman .
3077,phone adn computer technology hav gone a very long distance since their invention . did you know that unicef will donate clean water for a day o needed child for every minute we do not usd our cell phone
3078,"that is intereting , does texting counts ? or is it just the voice ?"
3079,"i am not sure . also , i am wondering about the purpose of not using our phone and what benefits of not using our phone brings ?"
3080,"you are right , how does someone the money from the ninusage of someone else 's phone ?"
3081,it is fascinating that soldiers in wwii used only a razorblade wand pencil to make a simple radio
3082,"the principle of a radio is catching an electrical wave , is it quite simple , if you are near an emitted , sometimes you an hear it i your speaker without even tuning ."
3083,"i learn something new from you . that is interesting to know . btw , nice chatting with you . enjoy your holiday"
3084,"think , you to ."
3085,bye
3086,bye
3087,i love to read romantic novels . what the of books do you like to read ?
3088,"yes , i love t rad those romantic novels as well though i have n't done much readings lately ever since footbal season started and now basketball . any favorites in particular ?"
3089,i am a huge fan of what sarah unclean recommends . show 's a washington post column .
3090,"oh ok , i 'm not too familiar with her work , i 'll have to look it up after the chat . id o follow a couple of sports authors and read an opinion piece on ny the authors thinks the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink ."
3091,do you have a list of sport authors for books you have read ?
3092,"i like books y michael lewis and ellie kennedys ut recently there 's been more debate about the dangers of football on head injuries . those articles are really convincing , how do you feel about football ?"
3093,"i know a lot of facts about nfl and i watch the superbowl , m but other than that , i 'm lost for words as to why people like football . howe an a lame with 11 minutes of live gameplay take 3 tours of air tome ."
3094,"haha , i feel he same was ! it 's because they need to play ads so as to beat the average lifetime earnings of engineers because supposedly their earnings are higher than the average lifetime earnings of nfl players which i find a to believe ."
3095,"damn , i did not know engineers made that much . i should have gone into the stem field back in college . neat 's a factoid to add to my future discussions . ?"
3096,"yeah m i should 've done that too and if my kids ever wasted to be professional cheerleaders , i would be very opposed to it especially since the saints ceherleazders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant ws are nfl players . they 're humans too !"
3097,that sounds like borderline discrimination but i guess they do n't want to cheerleaders to influence the game . they must have had previous encounters of bad press .
3098,"yeah or gender bias too ! not sure , i did n't read bout that in teh news , at least ot anytime recently , i 'm surprised there ; s no metoo campaign surround that rule !"
3099,"i guess it 's only a metoo moment if they were touched . i doubt htey were . i 'm surprised that there 's no female nfl players , since it is no written rule against this ."
3100,"books point , but there 's something wrong with that rule . yeh , but even if females can play , i 'd imagine some would have a difficult time meeting the leagues physical eligibility requirements , i 'm not sure what that is , do you know ?"
3101,i do n't know . there are ome muscular females out there in the world . certain some of them can give people a run for the spot .
3102,"yeah , women can be aggressive and strategize as well ! they even use track chips to monitor and record 'the players move on the field , i would love to see the data it hat ."
3103,"i wounder if that 's their attempt to bring statistics into the game , similar to how baskeball is all as statistical game . sounds like some 1950 harvard matheamtic research team with the latest gadgets ."
3104,"haha , thas would be cool to tracks , like how fast a quarterback can throw a ball or the force at which someone tackles . i wonder if the player 's contracts for salary are adjusted because they 're either one of the fastest players o something ."
3105,i doubt te franchise would even know what to do with this data . a lot of them are retired football players wh just knows the old fashion game play and will probably never adopt new technology .
3106,"oh that 's a good point . besides football , i also . ike to watch comedies and find bromatic comedies to be especially popular and funny ."
3107,yes . i love harold and kumar . i also love white castle . maybe i should go fo some white castle burgers after this .
3108,"haha yea h ! i have never half any white castle before , thoug thik would love to try some time after seeing their love for the burgers ."
3109,there should still be a few of them around . well i 'm gon na head out for a burger run . have a good one .
3110,"hello there , do you follow football much ?"
3111,i do ! my favorite of the 22 teams is teh dolphins . we have n't eden good since the 70 's .
3112,"well you certainly started teh season pretty good and i thin that one of the best plays of the year , i think ? lol ."
3113,i love to watch event enough there is only 11 minutes of gameplay .
3114,is n't that crazy when you thin about it . i know that on tv i do n't notice so much but when you go to a live game you do much more .
3115,"i would love to see their behind the scenes tech , specifically the chips reports from te ; layers pads that show every move ."
3116,"same here , and i think a lot 0 fall that tech stiff helps with player safety as well ."
3117,hopefully ! cte is scary . the rest hey take on should be compensated better ; engineers make more in a lifetime than players .
3118,"it really is , i think all parents with children interested in playing should watch that concussion movie ."
3119,concussion was certainly not a comedy ! there was no humor on that topic .
3120,"no , not the usual wall smith movie , i thought it as really goo d , and not issue is no joke and will continue to be !"
3121,"will smith 's best bromance movie was bad boys . other really funny bromance were the hangover , pineapple express , and harold and kumar ."
3122,"yeah i remember watching bad boys , that was pretty entertaining ."
3123,my favorite sitcom was friends . i miss i . i did not think 3rd rock from the sun deserved the golden globe in 1997 over friends .
3124,"friend sizes age that show , thy had so much talent there . i was and am more of a seinfeld fan , 3rd rock was ok ."
3125,i just love tha comedies generally have a happy ending . i love to smile and laugh .
3126,"yeah same here , and comedy is pretty hard to do right !"
3127,it is a natural talent 3d demetri martin took the gamble on comedy when he left harvard laws fool .
3128,"that is true , and i think it paid off in the long run for him . did you see what bill murray said of th movie , kung fu hustle ?"
3129,i love bill murray ! my favorite of his was ghostbusters 's . i know be loved kung fu hustle but i am not familiar with a quote .
3130,"oh yeh that was one of my all time favs growing up when i was a kid . it 's been nice chatting , hope you have a good day !"
3131,hey can you guess th stop 3 richest presidents in history ?
3132,i knows bout jefferson and washington ? who else is in there ?
3133,"well i thought it would be trump but it is actual ; lol jfk , weird !"
3134,"oh wow , i guess they had a lot of money back then . did you know the guest house is larger than the white house ?"
3135,"haha i did n't know that seems od d , halo odd is th president of zimbabwe 's name is president banana haha"
3136,yeah i wonder if that means something else in their language though
3137,"ya i do n't know haha , i think president banana shoudl release a pop album though like te pres . of indonesia did haha"
3138,"yeah that guy honestly , a president and a pop star . wonder if they are good"
3139,"haha i 'll have to check it you , did you know that teh runner up in the pres . election used to become the vp ? trump and hillary would ave been in the white house together . , maybe they release a pop album together ' hah"
3140,hahahha that would have been funny . did you know the white house has twin buildings in ireland and france ?
3141,"ya i think they 're like twin buildings so exactly the same , do you think the interior have similar ; paintings an desks or is it completely different ? haha"
3142,i have no idea . and do the presidents of those countries like there too ?
3143,"haha thats a good question , did you like teddy roosevelt ? i think he 's pretty awesome , he would wrestle wild animals haha"
3144,i heard he also banned christmas trees from the white house
3145,"ya he few , a nd he also gave a speech , got shot in the chest , and the continued giving the speech haha"
3146,pretty amazing . did you know they still use floppy discs at the white house ?
3147,haha i have heard they do ! but they do have solar panels so at least that is somewhat advanced
3148,yes i like that . do you watch football ?
3149,"i wathc hit a bit i saw the superbowl , i was glad the patriots won nd they have a teammate who has never fumbled the ball !"
3150,"yah that is actually pretty amazing , gold for him . did you know espn on and emmy ?"
3151,"i did know taht , i think for that yellow line on tv ? definitely a great invention !"
3152,"yeah , that is it . nice chat"
3153,"hello , are you a fan of football ?"
3154,not really mostly college football at my alma mater .
3155,i wonder if you school 's team is good . i know the highest score in college football ever was 2220 .
3156,"my team , you mountaineers , good or bad get my support and they do well but hav eps and downs . i think it 's just the fan support adn community support that we all cars for our state ."
3157,"tat 's fair , hopefully they support other teams to some extent as will . i know the university of iowa does n't , htey even paint visiting locker rooms pink ."
3158,"all that 's the competition mentality taken to extreme , so prevalent today , i think at these times we are missing the point really ."
3159,"that 's a fun 3point , competition inspires people to be better . i 'm sure benjarvus greenellis faced a decent amount to inspire him , probably how he never fumbled the football ever ."
3160,"yes , i agree , when he played it was probably a completely different game ."
3161,i thing it ' stood that competition inspires innovation though . espn even won an emmy for reacting the superimposed yellow line for first downs .
3162,"yes , that was a good one , but i really think it was an effort to take the ' human error ' part out of the game . most people have a problem with officiating in such a fluid game ."
3163,"speaking of ' human error ' , are you interested din politics ?"
3164,somewhat but the stuff going on now really cakes me want to keep that stuff off ny radar in order to get through the day with at least some pets end tranquility .
3165,"i think you have to find humor in it somehow . for example , the president of indonesia released 3 pop albums in office , that 's funny to think ."
3166,that 's hilarious but it makes you wonder what hte motivation is for people like that .
3167,"no clue , i 'm sure money must have been a motivation . trump is somehow not one of teh three wealthiest us presidents ever ."
3168,that is interesting and i do believe that . i support trump but i do n't agree with everything . ten again he is not a politician but a businessman adn it kind that is the difference that people ca n't quite put together .
3169,presidents certainly seem tp place heir personal beliefs in office and are n't able to separate them . i know roosevelt banned christmas trees because he was a conservationist .
3170,well they are like everybody else they have their own though son things and i think they should be able to express those thoughts to a certain degree .
3171,taunts definitely fair . however they should pay the same diligence to important things as well . it somehow took th white house 4 days ti realize bullets had hit them on 9 or 11 .
3172,"i know , pretty unbelievable , but it seems now nobody s required to do their jobs to get paid . i do it everyday . it 's a general decline in society that as been uncheckedd for some time . just my take on it ."
3173,"that certainly seems true sometimes . at least they can be socially responsible at time d , i know george w . bush put solar panels back on the white house ."
3174,i think that was probably a good gesture for him to do but the actual benefit is still probably debatable .
3175,"i 'm sure it was , i probably gave him more credibility than president banana of zimbabwe , who probably lost credibility just becaue of his name ."
3176,i have never heard about him but i give him props for not changing it .
3177,"for sure , on the other hand props to the election system roar improving over time . i we stuck to old ways , the vice president would just be whoever was runner up , that certainly would n't work today ."
3178,"nope , tht would not work . at least it shows we can make adjustemnts to the system that benefit everybody regardless ."
3179,"absolutely , we can continue to improve and looks forward to these future . anyway , it was nice chatting with you !"
3180,"yes , i as nice chatting with you as well ."
3181,take fare !
3182,"hi , how are you ?"
3183,"good , but a little ad that the superbowl is over . do you like footbal , and if so , what did you think of the superbowl this year ?"
3184,"i didnt ' watch , but i heard it was pretty slow . it got exciting at the end . the patriots won again . hm ."
3185,"if you like a high scoring shootout , this was anything but tha to i like the fastpaced style , similar to canada football . this installment was seriously slow . a defensive battle ."
3186,last year 's superbowl what better . quite w contrast to theyd rubbing that cumberland took in 1916 .
3187,these teams needed something to help them perform better ofensivelymaybe a fight songsomthing similar to the one written by snoop dog for his son 's school .
3188,"snoop ! he really ha the talent . he should run for office , maybe president ."
3189,it wonder what his net worth is these days . did yo know the highest paid employees of tha us department of defense are footballs roaches ? but i bet they ca n't rap !
3190,"sports brings is the money , do coaches command high salaries . in an age when we need scientists and engineers , them money goes to spectacle ."
3191,"yup . but our children are trained that way . have you ever been to a high school football game in texas ? down in allen texas they have a high school stadium worth it million and which seat 18 , 00 fans . yeah , we train our children toward spectacle ."
3192,"the parents and community members in those texas towns probably do n't have much else for entertainment . still , once high school i shoe , those students will not be players . they need education ."
3193,"that usa unless the high shooters go on to college , w here the spectacle continues ! 14 . the world 's 25 largest stadiums are at american colleges ."
3194,"schools want money , and alumni want winning teams . it 's funny that bowlers used to make more money than football players hack , the 60s ."
3195,"bizarre , right ? i live in a college town , and on game day , flags are flying all over town , with the biggest being a 100000 american flag monster t the football stadium , screaming , ' in you live this country , you thta love this game ! '"
3196,"i enjoy football , but not to that degree . people should devote more time to following presidential politics ."
3197,"those presidential manages will soon be invading all teh early primary and caucus states , but i will be a while before they fill up stadiums like the president . lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration , and john wilkes booth wa sin that picture a ironic that it signals the death of humility in politics ."
3198,"the next election is bound to be an interesting l i do n't know who the dems will finally pick , but for the next 12 months it will be confusion . i 've heard that the white house still uses floppy disks . i wonder if that 's for security ."
3199,"maybe . they should use fancy encryption technology , but then they would not know how to translate them back to english . fdr was he last president port be able t speak a foreign language fluently ."
3200,"well , i enjoyed chatting wtih you !"
3201,and i enjoyed texting with you as well . i the presidential election nmakiesz a turn for the better . i hope hte victor gets a clean majority of electoral and popular vogue to send a strong message to washington .
3202,ok
3203,"good afternoon , hop out 's going well do you . are you interested in politics ?"
3204,a lot more since trump as been president !
3205,it 's interesting that the power a presiden has depends on what form of government there is in the country . we tend to assume they ar wall like the us and a republican form of government .
3206,"in parliamentary republics , they are largely ceremonial ."
3207,"yes , liek in the uk . i like the way he did things before 1800 where the runner up became vice president . maybe things over a little more balances hem since i assume birth parties here represented ."
3208,i guess we are lucky we are not in an authoritarian regime or dictatorship .
3209,"yes , venezuela is a good example of that hat would be terrible ! i love that the president o indonesia hasnt turned out 3 pop alums , while in office ! i wonder what the people think of that ?"
3210,the first president of zimbabwe was called banana !
3211,"i hope tha i a name of affection ? i wonder if they call him that to his face or is that more of a nickname , like potus ?"
3212,have you ever been to the white hous e ?
3213,no i have n't . have you ? i hear that the president 's guest house is bigger than the white house !
3214,there are twins in ireland and france
3215,"really ? i wonder in what city ? since john adams was the first president to live there , i wonder where those that were president before 1800 lived ?"
3216,great question . roosevelt banned christmas trees from the white house .
3217,"yes , he was really into environmental issues ans dad n't approved of cutting down trees . i think most of our national parks got their start during his time in office ."
3218,"bush also , he ha solar panels installed ."
3219,"yep , he added a mode touch with those . speaking of modern a not being modern , it 's hard to believe that the white house sill uses floppy disk at store part of it 's data ! i dint ' even know those cout ; d still be read ."
3220,"i wonder if they have any pictures of aliens on them , lol . did you know bill ; ets hit the white house ?"
3221,i did n't know about that ! that is scary . it 's interesting how thet er white house ' has cool to be used not only for the building but also for the president and all his advisers .
3222,it took the secret service 4d a to realize the bullets though
3223,"that 's so strange and they never found who did it ? i bet jfk , washington and jefferson , the 3 most wealthy presidents , would be shocked at how much money is spent on political races , these days ."
3224,you have grea questions ! nice talking to you .
3225,"you too , i learned a lot today about government ."
3226,have a good one !
3227,you too .
3228,see ya
3229,hi how are you ? do you like football ?
3230,sure do . i even play fantasy football .
3231,i dont know that . how does it work ? do you make money ?
3232,it is certainly possible to make money . mostly it is a way to create interest i players on teams you do not root for such as lamar jackson .
3233,"oh , ok . are you good at this ? i guess you must know the layers very well then ."
3234,"i know a lot abou some players like biker mayfield on the browns , but my ot an expert ."
3235,baker mayfield ? is e good ? does he play video games ?
3236,"ba , er mayfield s good . i do not know of his videos tame habits . do you follow the real nfl ?"
3237,i dont usually . i follow around he playoffs . i try to watch the super bowl .
3238,the super bowl is usually held the first sunday in february .
3239,"yes , i was unable to watch it this year . busy . but i heard the game was not that exciting this year ."
3240,there is always some interest in the champions of the nfc and afc playng each other .
3241,i guess so . i usually root for the underdog . i like the upset . do you bet on the game ?
3242,i am not allowed to gamble because i work fo was company that makes rocking chips in shoulder pads !
3243,thats great ! lol . the tracking chips . can they track players off the field to make sure they do go to the same restaurants as cheerleaders ?
3244,"i would guess so , although players do n't wear shoulder pads to restaurants . maybe ask matt patricia , who is for a coach and a rocket scientist ."
3245,"the chip space only in the shoulder pads ? ok , s o that wo n't work . matt might have a way to keep track of those guys an their eating habits ."
3246,"true . a big change from the first nfl playoff game , e in 1932 !"
3247,"i think that hte nfl has come a long way ? . the players make more , the teams are bigger , everything is bigger . al ot of injuries , though . anyway , great chat !"
3248,thanks ! i think i wills o read ip o nthe 32 teams in the nfl .
3249,"enjoy ! i 'll talk to you later , i 'm sure ."
3250,no problem . rpi is a cool university !
3251,"hi , how are you doing today ?"
3252,"i omg for , thanks . i 'm wondering if you are a football fan like me ? i know a lot of people are sad the season is over , especially since fantasy football i such a hit ."
3253,"i like football , but i do n't get much chance to watch . usually i try to catch the sb ."
3254,what is teh sb ? i know if fantasy football in 's all about the picks and people plan for weeks .
3255,"superb owl . sorry , should have made that clear . i 've never played fantasy sports . waht 's the goal ? how do you win ? what do you win ?"
3256,"oh , duh , sorry . he goal is to draft the best team by picking members from all teams to make the best . did you know bowlers in the 1960 's made more tha nfl players ?"
3257,i believe i the bowlers had their golden age . many leagues and lots of local interest . then the mode gladiators shower up and stole the show .
3258,yes ! i used to now myself on a learned . i am more of a football fan . i know former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis ever had a fumble in his career !
3259,how did he do that ? special gloves ? giant hands ? did eh get a bonus ? i hope so !
3260,i think just raw talent . it 's hard to say if he got a bonus since th nfl has a total f 32 teams . it ? s hard to keep up .
3261,i ca n't keep up . that 's why i follow during the playoffs . i think that it would be interesting to see if a woman could play .
3262,"actually , the nfl has no rules agains women playing as long as they meet the league ' eligibility requirements !"
3263,i figure that a woman could be kickers or something . they should be referees and such .
3264,i would say . i would n't want to see a man v woman contract .
3265,"yes , i think it woudl make the viewers squeamish . maybe women on women though . that could be fun ."
3266,i am not sure i could watch ! although the average game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
3267,"tht seems short , but i guess they stand around waiting a lot . great work , if you can get it ."
3268,"yeah , i kidding . although the average lifetime salary of engineers is higher than the average lifetime warning of an nfl player ."
3269,"plus fewer concussions too . i think it would be better for you , en to . into engineering ."
3270,"yeah , no kidding ! i know the cheerleaders on teh saints have to leave a restaurant if a team player is there ."
3271,"sexism , plain and simple . anyway , great chatting !"
3272,great chatting with you too !
3273,thanks !
3274,take are !
3275,are you a football fan ?
3276,"a little bit , yourself ?"
3277,"yes i find it curious that the iowa states visiting lock , er room is painted pink ."
3278,i wonder if it 's to intimidate the other team ?
3279,"maybe but that would just ma , e me mad and focused !"
3280,the opposite of what they want ! did you see where there was once a football game score of 2220 ?
3281,no i never saw that a a that is ridiculous hey should have a mercy rule or something . who was that ?
3282,georgia torch v cumberland !
3283,wow i didn ot hear about this game . was it recent ?
3284,"no , i think it was back in the day ! espn won an emmy fo that superimposed line they use though ."
3285,"yeah to help viewers see where the first down in is . i do that line , haha ! you know there is a rb that never fumbled the ball is entire career ?"
3286,no ! who was that ?
3287,he 's a former patriot benjarvus greenellis .
3288,wow ! did you hear the nfl finally drafted a womans one there is no rule against it ?
3289,no i didn ; t hear the actually drafted one . do you know who she is ?
3290,i do n't . but i bet if you google you will find her ! i wonder if they will use those chips in her uniform to seem ow she does ?
3291,well hte whole purpose is no discrimination so i dont see why not . they should just create a women league like the wnba .
3292,i wonder if it would get watched ? did you know a game generally only has 11 minutes of live play ?
3293,"that 's crazy nd hard to believe . so there are 32 teams , do you have a favorite ?"
3294,"not really , i like the new orleans saints . how bout you ?"
3295,the team yes the rule about the cheerleaders no . have you heard ot that rule ? i 'm assuming it has something to d with employee fraternization ?
3296,what rule ? great chatting with you !
3297,are you a football fan
3298,i am . i used to watch nfl sunday all the time . i do n't anymore though . how about you ?
3299,i at every sunday . it is my favorite time . did you know that quarterback 's average passing was 93 ? 6 now
3300,that 's really impressive it i find it more interesting that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . it 's still fun to watch
3301,i know . i think because the league prefers offense over defense nowaday
3302,"i believe that . to fans want action all of the time . watching defensive play after defensive play cav get annoying . also , you want point grabbed on your fantasy team too . defense does n't always help you win ."
3303,did you kno wthe th university football locker room was painted in all pink
3304,that 's a great way to mess with the visiting team ! do you play fantasy football ?
3305,"hahaha . yeah , i play occasionally . you ?"
3306,i used to . i actually used to love playing fantasy hockey . i was much better at that . i never knew that espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line ! i did n't think you could win an emmy for that .
3307,i di not that people fantasy draft the national spelling bee
3308,i can see that . i did n't know it actually existed though . it 's like in vegas yu can bet on anything
3309,"also , do you know that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving fantasy and reality"
3310,that is really interesting . almost as interesting as the fact that the saints ' cheerleaders can not eat in the same restaurant as ny nfl player
3311,i think they do not wan any distraction np hahah
3312,probably . i guess it 's written into their cotnrac t .
3313,football players are having too much troubles already
3314,that 's true . but it seems everyone else has to change the rays for them .
3315,i believe so because money talks
3316,it absolutely does .
3317,"by the way , nice chatting with you . happy holiday"
3318,say to you ! happy holidays !
3319,bye
3320,"hello , how are you ?"
3321,hi k do you play fantasy football ?
3322,"no , i do not . how about you ?"
3323,"no , are you wa 49ers fan ? garoppolo the quarterback is had his struggles and fantasy footbal players are making their choices ."
3324,i am not a huge fan of football . just watch it when i can . th highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 . this guy insane !
3325,"i don ' play fantasy football , but i might try out fantasy drafting the national spelling bee . apparently , people do that ."
3326,coo . i didnt really know that
3327,how would you like to be part of fantasy congress ? players can draft members of congress a bet on legislature success .
3328,that is not bad at ll . i would definetly want to be part of that
3329,dd you hear that the lifetime average earnings of an engineer is higher than that of an average mlb or in player ? sounds like a good occupation .
3330,but also requires s lot of education . i am pretty sure it is not that easy
3331,"no , i studied it for a few years and changed majors . it is very difficult and you have to live hat type of material to study i y ."
3332,of course . what 's what i meant
3333,"if you visit th university of iowa , you can see a pink locker room !"
3334,yep . i read that too . very interesting and dugferen tat the same time
3335,of you hear that bowlers in the 60 ? s were very well paid ? they made twice as much as top football stars at the tiem
3336,"yep . . a janitor from chicago wrote over six year a 15 , 145page fantasy manuscript with over 300 watercolor illustrations called ' in the realm of the unreal ' , which was only discovered after his death . . fascinating , is n't it ?"
3337,wow . fantasy sure is prominent everywhere .
3338,"new orleans saints cheerleaders art forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant nd an nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave . is n't this a little too much ?"
3339,that sounds sexist . do you think a woman ill make it to the nba . there i no rye against it ?
3340,"even though there ish n't a rule against it , i do n't think so"
3341,nice talking to you . who you rooting for in the superbowl ?
3342,good morning ! do you follow the nfl ?
3343,"i do , i even walk a fantasy football gem , what about you ?"
3344,i love playing fantasy football . have played for bout 17 or 18 years now . did you know that they even have a fantasy league for congress ?
3345,"i dont really know hear but i do know a bit about players qb marcus mariota is a bad choice , in of hte worst qbs in the season"
3346,i agree . i kind of thought eh was a little overrated when he was drafted .
3347,"yeah only 13 td passes which is low for a qb , he did have a better season the previous year"
3348,saquon barkley should be a good pick for the fantasy draft next season .
3349,im not aware of that player in what position does i play ?
3350,he i sa running back for the new york giants .
3351,"oh i see , he must be a great choice then so fantasy football , people seem to love fantasy leagues not only sports bu trust about anything"
3352,yes they do . they even have a fantasy draft for the national spelling bee . i have no idea how that works though .
3353,no idea either it does sound kind of boring theres even a fantasy congress league
3354,i 've heard about that leads . that 's where players draft members o congress and points are based off legislative success . sounds like a snoozefest to me .
3355,"sounds also reilly boring , who knows it might be interesting , so do you also like fantasy movies ?"
3356,ca n't say that i do . lol do you like them ?
3357,"i do like them , interesting fact but a janitor wrote over 15 , 145 page of fantasy but never published his work"
3358,that 's a lot of waiting . i wonder why after putting all that work into i the never published it . maybe it was back in the days before the internet where you had to have a book deal to get published .
3359,"maybe he didnt think bits book had potential or was waiting to finish i , he died and then the piece of literature got discovered so its hard to tell now"
3360,i agree with you . did you know that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy ?
3361,"thats interesting i didnt know that , our brain is sure full with m , mysteries"
3362,i agree ! it 's been fun chatting with you !
3363,"yeah , its also been great chatting with you , thanks for the chat ."
3364,do you watch football much ?
3365,i do from tiem to time .
3366,"me too , i am a university of iowa football fan , they paint their visitors locker room ink !"
3367,that 'd co ? do you watch the nfl at all ?
3368,"i love watching the nfl , out of the 2 teams , my favorite is hte vikings , do you have a favorite ?"
3369,i like the cardinals adn 49ers .
3370,nice i was a 49ers fan back in the day . i loved jerry rice and steve young . games were more exciting back then . now gametime is only like 11 minutes o factual playing
3371,i know ! do you follow the odds for each team winning at all '
3372,"i do not , what are they ?"
3373,it is part of how te betting on each team is handled . there is an over or under o each team winning g .
3374,"gothic , i think your teams have low odds of winning it all currently , that may change with voter picks . did you know who benjarvus green ellis was ?"
3375,i thunk he was a running back . you are correct about my teams winning it all . the vikings do not appeal rio be doin to well either .
3376,nope lol . maybe benjarvus needs to come back and teach our teams how to not fumble the ball !
3377,lol ! it seems when th vikings play the packers one would pick the packers . what do you think ?
3378,"well not now , packers are almost worst than both pr teams love ! i think th vikings and 49ers could beat them 2220 like georgia tech beat a team in 1916"
3379,i doubt it . i would say the packers are favored over teh vikings . i would not bet against rogers .
3380,"that is true , he is pretty prime time . he is y quarterback gore my fantasy football team , i ca n't bt against him"
3381,"lol ! did you know that one of them is expensive high school football stadiums was built in allen , tx ?"
3382,"o read that in one article , how much was it ? that is a waste of money in my opinion !"
3383,it was 60 billion . i know that is a ton o money ! did you also know that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son 's football team ?
3384,"wow that id so much money ! i rid not know about snoop , i want to hear it . i will go check it out now . have an amazing day friend !"
3385,acre you a big nfl fan ?
3386,i sm . i like watching football even thought he games only have an average of 11 minutes of live game play .
3387,"i have heard that broke , it 's crazy to think of that . i guess most of the time is spent moving the chains , and player , and coaches ."
3388,yeah . i think the technology for marking the first down line is pretty amazing . espn won an emmy for creating the yellow line we see on tv .
3389,"really ? i did n't know tht , very interestin . dig suess that does help a lot with the viewers ."
3390,yeah . technology is huge in football . the only now uses tracking chips in shoulder ads to record players movement on the film . they also track ball movement .
3391,"yeh i can see them doing that . i know they are tracking a lot more done it foxes to hitting top , the helmets i in have trackers ."
3392,i would have liked to be the engineer who designed the tracking chips . did you know that the average engineer makes more in a lifetime than the average nfl player ?
3393,"wow , i would never have guessed hat about them ,"
3394,yeah . in the 60 's the top bowlers made twice as much ashe top footbal ; stars ! crazy !
3395,no way that 's crazy . i guess the dream job would be pro bowler in the 60 's lol !
3396,that would be crazy . imagine if we had fatal leagues for pro bowling . we do have fantasy drafts for the national spelling bee !
3397,"stat would b too funny , and really , that is pretty unbelievable . i guess there is a fantasy comic who has been knighted ."
3398,"that would be awesome to be knighted . there was once a janitor from chicago who wrote a 15 , 45 page fantasy manuscript over six years . that guy deserves to be knighted ."
3399,wow yeah that is the guy hat should have been . are you into the lord of the rings fantasy novel s ?
3400,not really . i have the mon my list to read did watch . i did enjoy the harry potter fantasies .
3401,i have not read those but have read half of the tolkien fantasy novels .
3402,that 's cool . it 's crazy to think that a single fold in the brain makes the difference in our perception of reality and fantasy . taken must have had a very tight fold !
3403,"that is a crazy idea , and yeah he must have !"
3404,"if you could write a fantasy novel , would it be based on oral traditions or would it likely be based on more modern media ?"
3405,"i think traditions , modern media ie pretty gross if you ask me . i like old time stuff better myself ."
3406,i agree . have a great night !
3407,o you watch the nfl ?
3408,o do watch the nfl . j watch the super bowl . what about you ?
3409,"i watched it , i though it was boring this year . did you know that espn won an emmy for the 1st down maker you see on tv ?"
3410,wow that 's crazy . i . n't know if that 's worth it any but it is certainly useful . i do like the patriots and i guess that they have a running back was never fumbled the ball . they should give him the ball very time . are atl east i would haha
3411,"yeh , me too . hilarious , but you know there is only 1 minute of live gameplay during a full armed ;"
3412,well liek you said the super bowl was really boring this year so that kind of does not surprise em haha another boring a would be the highest scoring fooball game ever . it was 222 to 0 haha
3413,crazy ! did you know the nfl uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads ?
3414,that actually scared me . i 'm sure they yet a lot of great stats that they can one like the rotation of he ball . but i just hope that they keep it in the game and they do n't pu tit on actual citizens lke you or me
3415,"yeah , i wonder if it is teh nfl collecting it o the texas themselves to optimized plays ."
3416,but it 's both honestly . what are your thoughts on the new orleans saints cheerleaders being forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as an nfl player ?
3417,i think a lot f teams actually have that . the redskins have one too where players ca n't fdraternizew with the cheerleaders .
3418,oh i did n't know that . it seems very outdated but i guess they might have a reason for it . do you know any engineers that you 're friends with ?
3419,"yeah , i 'm one and i have a bunch of friends that do it . on average we make more than a football player !"
3420,"oh that 's awesome . and a that is what i have read did you know that the nfl has no rule against emulate players . do you think we 'll see ones in our lifetime , e ?"
3421,"i 've heard taht before , but i do n't know if americans can stomach seeing a woman setting injured o teh tied ."
3422,that 's a food point tthat i never thought about . what i also interestin to me i stat an nfl game only has about 10 or 11 minutes to it that seems super low .
3423,"year , that makes sense , it is mostly standing around if you all me . i still love the game , but the clock watching gets annoying ."
3424,yep i agree with that . do you watch any fantasy movies . or o you do fantasy football at all
3425,"i used to play fantasy football , but i no longer have the time for it t be honest . what about you ?"
3426,i never played fantasy football but i did bear that they have fantasy national spelling bee and aps fantasy confess that seems so stupid haha
3427,"weird , i wonder how tey rate the players ahead of time ? well nice chatting with you !"
3428,do you like football ?
3429,"i do watch some once in a while , you ?"
3430,ish ave a passing knowledge . how familiar are you with the sport ?
3431,"i knw some of the basics , but i also know hat there is really only 11 minutes of active game play . crazy seeing how long the games are ."
3432,"i agree . it is also interesting how they have no rules against female players ? however , i wonder if the eligibility requirements inherently disqualify them ?"
3433,"they might , or just make it so they wont want to play . i mean i think anyone who is good enough should be eligible to play . but i can iamgiune many women who would want to go up against 00 pound linemen"
3434,it is a dangerous sort and i dont ' think footbal is as develope a spot for women comparitively to must others sports
3435,i would agree t hey even have chips in shoulderpads to record moves of players and with that they can see how hard they get hit .
3436,"i heard they also put chips in the footballs themselves 5o gather data on velocity , rotation , speed , and location"
3437,"yeah , with that do you think it could also help determine reviews ? like use that data to say where the ball was or waist at any given point ."
3438,tha ti am not sure fine i am not sure how much of that at all effective real time
3439,"the yellow line sure helped things develop in terms of home viewership , so much so that espn won an emmy for it"
3440,true . it probably aide things much more dijgextible for the general audience and promoted its popularity
3441,did you know that th highest scoring and biggest spread was in a game in 1916 ?
3442,i imagine i was at least hundreds apart ?
3443,"2220 , i dont even ses how that is possible . that one team must have been really bad ."
3444,perhaps a combination of the winning team being just thati moon and the losing great being so bad
3445,"ive seen some blow outs , b ut never by that much ."
3446,did you every play fantasy football l ?
3447,"u never have , but my brother gets seriously into it ."
3448,"ah well i would recommend it . in any case , thanks for chatting ."
3449,i never knew the nfl was the highest professional level of football int he world . did you ?
3450,i did . the 17 week regular season is my favorite sports season .
3451,do yo watch 'the playoffs ?
3452,i do ? there are four division winners for each conference that advance to hte playoffs . the ravens are my favorite team .
3453,interesting . i understand that computer chips are used to track movements of players and the ball . that is really high tech .
3454,"i know . not like it used to be . i knew they were in the bal l , but did n't know they were in the shoulder pads of the players ."
3455,so are women allowed to play ?
3456,"yes , but none have met the league 's eligibility requirements as of et ."
3457,i wonder what the requirements are . i ave watched a super bowl every now an then and those are good .
3458,"i do as well ew hat else is ther to do on the first sunday in february ? they are , bu ti l , ike the playoffs more . more of an emphasis on the game and not so much on the show ."
3459,i never thought about it but that 's true . it does seem to play up the commercials and half time performances .
3460,"very much so . there is a game between he champions of the nfc and afc , but alot of times the playoff game scarlet he better ones ."
3461,when do the playoffs start ?
3462,"its weekend , my favorite team , the raven 's , plan on sunday ."
3463,win do they play ? is now there re two conferences . shih any are they in ?
3464,"they play in the afc and play the chargers this weekend . the cheerleaders have been around town jhy7ping the game , but they usually can not hand ou twitch the players ."
3465,are there rules against that ?
3466,yes bt he saints cheerleaders can not even eat in the same restaurant as the players .
3467,i guess if is to keep the players from getting distracted or from bad press but teams .
3468,"i 'm sure . even if the cheerleader is already there , if a player walks into the restaurant the cheerleader has to leave ."
3469,that 's pretty strict .
3470,"i remember jj wat callled andy dalton nthe little red big un with his arm , he the worst quarterback , the afc north"
3471,"do n't know much about football , you say he was the worst quarterback . wo was thur best ?"
3472,"i would have to say it las the baltimore raven 's rookie qb lamar jackson seeing as how he way the only one in the division to get his team to the playoffs . but i can admit , i ' ; m biased"
3473,stat 's cook i remember seeing the cleveland browns play once how 's there qb ?
3474,baker mayfield ? he 's good . . i believe cleveland would have actually made the playoffs if he had started the whole season but i believe they named him the starter after liek 6 weeks
3475,i heard that the iowa universities looker room is painted pink for the visiting team .
3476,really ? t hat 's pretty interesting but if i was the opposite team that would just make me more angry on she field lol the defense and pass crashers are probably on the field trying to knock their heads off
3477,right i feel the same way ! ! di you now that in the 60 's top bowlers mad twice as much a nfl players ?
3478,"wow , when you think about how much 'the top harness in the nfl make today that 's almost mind blowing . that almost as crazy as people fantasy drafting the national spelling bee ."
3479,yeah know that is crazy . what about fantasy congress .
3480,where players draft members of congress and base the points off legislative success ? that sounds so boring in comparison to fantasy sports and i really dp n't even know ho 'you would gauge ' legislative success '
3481,"well if we believe that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy then who know , lol !"
3482,"haha crazy but true . . do you think we 'll ever see a female player int he nfl ? to my surprise , they are allowed to play as long as they meet the eligibility requirmdnets ."
3483,yeah i heard tha stand am surprised we have n't yet . personally i think they shoudl just have their own league like the wnba .
3484,"that would actually be pretty cool and i may enjoy watching that better than then fl lol they should be allowed to ve more than just cheerleaders , especially for the new orleans saints . the saints cheerleaders ca n't even eat in the same establishment as an nfl player and they even would have to get up and leave if one entered after them . . . sounds like throwback jim crow laws"
3485,"do n't start , lol ! however that id very sexist . on a lighter note did you hear about a janitor that wrote everyday over six years . 15 , 145 pages ?"
3486,"yeah thats ; very impressive , i wish he would have been alive to see his work discovered . i wonder what ever became of the works ? hopefully it was created and his family received the proceeds ."
3487,that would be the right thing to do . did you know that espn won a emmy award ?
3488,"yeah i figured tha tags the world wide leader in sports , but i had no idea it was for creating the first down marker superimposed in our televisions in yellow . that yellow one definitely makes the came more enjoyable and easy to follow at times . so well deserved lol"
3489,i agree my friend . so the nfl merged wit 'the afl after being formed in 1920 as the african football league .
3490,yes one soft he greatest and most profitable merger of all time . . . i bet they never imagined the game would expand to have 32 teams
3491,yeah humble beginnings . you know there is a new ho has never fumbled the ball in his career ?
3492,"yes , i remember watching greenellis play . he was n't too shabby . well i enjoyed al , king to you , i learned a few things ."
3493,do you watch football much ?
3494,"i sure do ! wish 32 teams in the nfl it is on all the time at , y place !"
3495,"do sure , do you have a favorite of the 32 ?"
3496,i really just like them all ! can you believe the nfl 's rules bout females ?
3497,"what is their rule , i do n't think they hve rules towards females fo thy ?"
3498,you are right ! they have nl rule against females playing as long aws they can meet the leagues eligibility requirements .
3499,"did , i wonder why we have never seen that before . i heard he saints have a rule regarding their female cheerleaders , kind of sexist , have you heard of it ?"
3500,"yes , if you are talking about the rule where cheerleaders are forbidden unto eat in the same restaurant as ann fl player ."
3501,"yea that one , that is so weird . i do n't understand it , what are your thoughts ?"
3502,"i wonder why it was made , s o what if a cheerleader and a player are married ? then what ?"
3503,"boom , mind blown ! lol i wonder if it was an odd rule back in the day , at least i hope so"
3504,"i know ! but who knows . so , can you believe the the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is more than an nfl player ?"
3505,"that is crazy , but believable , nfl careers tend to be short . the engineers maker hips to wrack a and deserve more money"
3506,"yes , yu are right ? they nfl even uses data chips !"
3507,"wow , i wonder what they track , do you know ?"
3508,they use tracking chips in the players shoulder pads and in the footballs .
3509,"dot hey track like velocity , rotation , and their every move ?"
3510,"yes , that is exactly it . that must relaly help late for some detailed game plans !"
3511,i agree . have you ever heard of benjarvus green ellis ?
3512,the name ring a bell . was he a patriot ?
3513,yep and a signal i think it en ever fumbled once in his career !
3514,wow ! that 's quite an accomplishment . what position did he play ?
3515,"he was a running back . he had a lot of carries too so that was amazing , it was so nice chatting with you !"
3516,do you keep up with the nfl at all ?
3517,"yea , i fo , low it like everyday . it 's interesting how todd hurley signed a 45 million extension with the rams and then ended up injured"
3518,especially stone guilty is a rb . that ' z the largest guarantee for that position
3519,"yea , i wonder ho much that influenced lennon bell not to sign with the steelers"
3520,"i guess the lifespan of running backs is n't very long , and some think bell may only hav on or two more seasons left . the deal he was offered is a five year deal"
3521,"i heard bell wanted 17 million a season , i would n't want to do that for five years"
3522,most start to decline in skill once they reach 27 . quarterbacks have a longer lifespan in the nfl
3523,"yea , a lot smith said heh ad a lot of years left but that was before his injury"
3524,it 's amazing how many injuries occur i na game that really only has about 11 minute sofa gameplay
3525,"yea , i bet the injuries us s major reason why engineers make more on average than nfl players in their lifetime"
3526,it might also be why we do n't see women playing in the nfl despite there not being a rule preventing it
3527,yea but i can see a woman plain at place kicker one day
3528,i 've heard that might be happening . she probably would n't mind the pink visitor 's lockers at the university of iowa
3529,"well there are female bowlers , i wonder if they made more than the top football star sin the 1960s"
3530,"if they did , television probably ruined that do them , especially hen the game became easier to understand with the yellow first own line created by espn . they deserved the emmy for that one"
3531,yea i 'm surprised no on thought of she yellow first down line sooner than espn
3532,true . i wonder who came up with the idea to embed chips in the footballs and shoulder pads for record data . it probably paved threw ay for fantasy football
3533,"yea but fnatas6 events have gotten out of hand , there is even a fantasy draft for the spelling bee"
3534,"no trust the spelling bee , but for congress as well . that seems like a lot"
3535,yea i 'm not a big fan of fantasy congress
3536,me neither . ; i do n't pay enough attention for that
3537,do you watch football ?
3538,yes i love football . do you ?
3539,"yeah , i like to watch it on sundays ."
3540,i like saturdays too because i like college football . did you know that 14 of the world 's 25 largest stadiums are for college football teams ?
3541,"yeah , the thing is , i never have time ons saturdays to watch ."
3542,"oh , i hear you . do you ever watch or go to high school games ?"
3543,"nah , highs school football is no good around here . what about you ?"
3544,i do n't know honestly . we have some necks that have won state championships in the area but i do n't ever go to the games .
3545,"i would think it would be more interesting if you went to the actual choo , ."
3546,"i would think so too but there 's a school ina allen , texas that spent 60 million dollars to build a football stadium to smart 18 , 000 people ."
3547,"wholly molly ! that is a ton of money , hopefully they hae a lot of fans ."
3548,i hope so too and i hope they have a lot of rich presidents to pay for that stadium .
3549,"yeah , me too . did you know the highest scoring game ever was 2220 ?"
3550,no ! what teams i that ?
3551,georgia tech versus cumberland .
3552,that sounds like two college teams . what couldnt ' have been any time recently right ?
3553,"no way , that was way back in 1916 . i do n't think they ore helmets then either . lol"
3554,1998 . i guess the didnt ave much on defenses either .
3555,"yeah , i wonder if cumberland was even on the field . lol , well , nice chatting with you !"
3556,it does't sound like they are . georgia tech was either super good or had no competition . it 's been nice chatting with you too !
3557,"yeah . hilarious , what a debacle . wall , have a nice day !"
3558,"hello , do you like football ?"
3559,"hi there , yes i do like it actually some of them also they can mean aw different thing in various countries"
3560,"yeah that is true , do you like american football ?"
3561,i actually do . u of iowa painted their visitor locker room pink
3562,hmm i wonder if that is supposed to ahve any effect on the opposing team or what
3563,yesh i wondr about that foo . did you know football players made more money than football ones in the 60s ?
3564,wow that is interesting . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
3565,i think it is 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
3566,yeah what a get that must have been . . i bet georgia tech stil brags about it
3567,i bet so too . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
3568,yeah they won it for the superimposed yellow line
3569,yeah and i am grateful for that because it makes game watching such easier at home
3570,"agreed there , for sure . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?"
3571,yeah that is the rb who never tumbled the full in his career
3572,yea tthat is him . did yo know women can play in then fl ?
3573,"yeah sincere here is no rule against them , , as long a they qualify"
3574,"yes that is true . ana average game lasts only , minutes too ."
3575,yeah that is pretty short and yet we are glued to the tv for hours
3576,tell me about it . engineers make more over their lifetime than football players .
3577,i guess that makes sense since they have longer careers love 'the lifetime
3578,hat is actually a really good point . nice chat .
3579,"helo here , are you a fan of th nfl ?"
3580,"hi ! yes , i really enjoy watching ll forms of sports though i 'm not too familiar with fantasy footbal , are you ?"
3581,"i a m , but i just started playing recently , i think fantasy baseball is the most fun surprisingly ."
3582,why is it surprisingly fun ? do the same number of players play on the field as does the real game ?
3583,"i am not as much into baseball as i am the other sports , but it makes the game a lot more fun to follow . you have teh same number of offensive players i think , and then like 6 spots for pitching ."
3584,"oh sorry , i think im at fantasy football but thanks for clarifying , i 'm not familiar with baseball at all as i am with football . if rb benjarvus greenellis had broken his nonfumble record during the superbowl , i think 'the made would 've been more entertaining to watch ."
3585,yeah the super bowl is year was pretty much a dud from the fans ' perspective . last years was much better .
3586,"i could n't agree more , though i think people who participated in sports betting would 've enjoyed his year 's game a lot more than last year ."
3587,"that you are probably right about . speaking of football , do you know what the highest scoring game pro or college ever was ?"
3588,"i do n't know what the highest he was , but if o had to take a guess , would it be in the seventeen ?"
3589,i guess it was 2220 ! in a college game georgia tech beat cumberland .
3590,thati so 've been as log time ago because i do n't remember seeing anything on the news or social media discussing that . i 'd imagine feeds would be flooded with jokes at the team ! i would also be surprised if female players played in the nfl because there 's no rules against it .
3591,yeah i 'm sure it was a long time was . i think that would be very lot if a female player would make a team .
3592,"yeh , i would love tos . that though i 'd imagine they would have to bee extremely buff to survive a tackle from those professional linebacker !"
3593,"yeah and be very fast , but it coudl happen , i know there are girls out there trying to make it ."
3594,"yeah , that 'll be a big step above how the saints treat their cheerleaders because they are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant was the players ."
3595,"i read that , i think that rule is pretty outdated and rather silly to be honest ."
3596,"yeah i agree , do you have any clue o theories as to why htey initiated that rule in the first place ?"
3597,"who knows , they probably do n't watch them dating the cheerleader from the team , but that 's just q random thought ."
3598,"yeah , t hat ' z a good theory . i ca n't think of any but i wonder what color the university of iowa 's cheerleader 's locker room is painted since they painted the visitor 's locker rooms completely pink ."
3599,yeah isn ? 'it that pretty funny ? i wonde rhino was in charge that gave the final ok for them to paint it that way .
3600,"has to be the head coach whenever the opposing team 's coach made him angry so to get back at the , that 's what they did to get in their heads ."
3601,free you a fan of football ?
3602,"i am , i like college and fl . what about thou ?"
3603,i sm . did you know the highest score was 2220 ?
3604,"yeah , did n't georgia tech beat cumberland that bad ?"
3605,"yeah , that was the game . crazy , right ?"
3606,yeah it is . i wonder if cumberland even pu sup a fight ?
3607,guess you had to be there to know !
3608,i wonder if they painted their visitor locker room pink like university of iowa ? that 'd make me want to eat somebody that bad . haha
3609,would you consider that cheating ?
3610,it 's not cheating if it works against you .
3611,that 's true ! did you know bowlers in the 60s made more than nfl stars .
3612,that 's crazy to think . i 'm sure it 's the other day round bi time now . but they do say that engineers lifetime earnings is higher than the lifetime earnings of an nfl player .
3613,i can believe that . i think some players do n't p ; ay that lion or make that much .
3614,they say the average career is 3 . 3 years for an nfl player . that 's kind of interesting seeing a do many players ahs long careers .
3615,"well , gameplay is only 11 minutes as walk ."
3616,it ; s crazy that it takes almost 3 hours for 11pm minutes of gameplay .
3617,"exactly , usually morse than 3 hours to be honest . lol"
3618,that is true . maybe they should get som fema ; le players out there . they could speed things up . there 's np rule against them player anyways .
3619,"yeah , there were female players in high school . anyways , nice chatting with you !"
3620,i remeber paying with some new sell .
3621,"yea , there were a few in my high school league . have a good evening ."
3622,i hope you have a good evening too l .
3623,"hi , how are you ? do you follow football ?"
3624,"i do , it 's my favorite sport . do hyou ?"
3625,i sometimes follow it . around playoffs . did you hear that the university of iowa 's locker zoom for visiting fooball teams is painted pink ?
3626,"i di d , i wonder f htey think that will throw off their opponent ?"
3627,i guest hat 's the idea . i ca n't imagine it really working or everyone would do i t .
3628,"yeah i think it must be more of a tradition now , i doubt a color would really affect another team 's performance ."
3629,"teh highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 . would pink looker rooms have helped cumberland , do you think ?"
3630,i do n't think anything would have ehlpedc cumberland that day . probably one a freak hurricane .
3631,"in the 60s ' top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . i wonder how much they actually , y made though ."
3632,i know that some of the players for my favorite tema in th 60 's had offseason jobs .
3633,i 've hear that too . now they need to learn to manage money . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . that seems short to me .
3634,teh ahve to fit in all those ads ! sometimes i like to watch hockey or basketball live more because of that .
3635,that 's true . the ads take up a lot of time in nfl tv gamer .
3636,especially during the super bowl . the charge millions off collars for those ads !
3637,quite true . the fans in th stand have to wait for the game to start up again .
3638,"sometimes there are videos , songs , or ; presentations in the stadium during those stoppage . if not , it woudl be super boring ."
3639,i imagine it would be . it might be interesting to see women in the game . the nfl has no written rule against female players
3640,"i would be worried that they would be seriously car t , there are over 300 pound men playing some of those positions . those hits have to do some major damage ."
3641,true . 11 minutes of combat .
3642,"i 'm all for women breaking barriers and the believe that they can accomplish anything a man can , but not a there is a chance for major injury just based n a size advantage ."
3643,"true . anyway , i enjoyed chatting with you !"
3644,"so did i , have a great day !"
3645,"hello , do you like fantasy ?"
3646,hello . i really o . it is some of my favorite genre of books . do you like it ?
3647,i do as well . i also like fantasy sports . do you play any fantasy sports ?
3648,no i never really got into fantasy sports . to be honest i 'm not really sure how they work . do people pick someone off stats or based on the teams ?
3649,ye pretty much . i love playing fantasy football . did you know there is a fantasy national spelling bee ?
3650,now that is a fantasy team i could see myself making . or the one where they do the fantasy congress . i do n't think i 'm knowledgable enough to do the sorts ones . i just watch for fun sometimes .
3651,haha that would be a fun one to play i congress . did you know a single fold in the brain is what makes the difference between reality and fantasy ?
3652,the human body relaly is ar remarkable thing . just in that one fold allowed a humble janitor to write an amazing fantasy masterpiece . i would love to read that .
3653,"i would love reading that too . it was 5 , 145 pages long . taht would take me a long time to read lo l ."
3654,tru it i think a few hundred pages are illustrations though so that helps . they should publish it ins overall books and see what the public things ? i sounds fascinating .
3655,that does sound really cool to check out . do you like football ?
3656,i do n't mind . . i live in football country so it is hard to avoid . i do n't have a particular team to root for but it is fun to watch sometimes . do you watch a lot ?
3657,i love football . iowa painted their opposing team locker rom pike .
3658,that sound like a very iowa thing . ther eis a huge rivalry between the college teams in iowa . i could see them doing it to try and intimidate the other team in some way .
3659,the average nfl game is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay .
3660,it really seems like it should be longer the that but i suppose there is the huddles and waiting for the snap . did you know that s ; n actually got an award for the creation of the yellow line to the field image ?
3661,i did see that about espn . i love that yellow line . i do n't know what i would do without it .
3662,yeah it really makes it easier fo 'the viewers to follow along at home . that ws a well deserved award .
3663,definitely . one nfl has no written rule against women playing in the league .
3664,it might not be a written rule bug the requirement are so out there that no woman is ever going to be anything mode has a cheerleader on a pro team . and usually not a well treated one east that especially in new orleans .
3665,"for sure . i could see them being a kicker one day . well , it was good chatting . take care ."
3666,hey did yo know th nfl has no rule against female players ?
3667,"smart move , no law suites that woudl be obvious and easy to pursue ."
3668,"ya that is we , do you think e 'll ever see one ? i think its possible in our lifetime"
3669,"i just saw soemthing about bill who is trying to turn pro . it seems a stretch , maybe as a kicker or punter ."
3670,"ya i could see tha t , do you watch the nfl ? a game actually only has about 11 mins of actual gameplay apparently"
3671,i just twitch ha few games here and there is ot so excited to see a bunch of millionaires play a game . how about you ?
3672,"ya i do n't watch any sports but i watched the superbowl , did you hear abou the weird rule the nfl has for saints cheerleaders ?"
3673,that is such a wierd rule . i wonder what the reason is ? no thanks pranks ?
3674,"lol , must be yes to prevent that sort of thing , i"
3675,not sure an engineer makes more than an nfl player .
3676,"ya i think hat was calculated over their lifetime , an nfl player makes a lot but only plays until age 40 or so"
3677,its funny that the have chips in the players shoulder pads .
3678,"ya that is crazy , i 'm just hopeful they never make citizens wear thos e , thats too much information to share !"
3679,do you do any fantasy football ?
3680,"i do n't actually , but i id see that people will do fantasy everything , even spelling bees !"
3681,they were actually betting on how many times they would say gronk in the super bowl ; maga not a fantasy league but a wierd sports related fact .
3682,"haha that is weird , do you do any fantasy stuff ? i guess people also do fantasy politics"
3683,"i do n't just do n't have the passion for it , you ?"
3684,"no i do n't , nad i just do n't care about sports personally haha , have you read anything abou terry pratchett ?"
3685,"i have not read about err pratchett , whats up with him ?"
3686,"well apparently he was knighted , he writes fantasy comedy noodles , a nd so if he was knighted then i would assume his work must be good !"
3687,i on not sure about that some people who have been knighted are real losers in my book .
3688,"haha like who ? one guy so is not a loser is the benjarvus greenellis , he has never fumbled a football !"
3689,are you a football fan ? do you follow any on do fantasy football ?
3690,no do really . how bout yourself ? are you a redskins fan ?
3691,do n't really follow football until the playoffs . not really a redskins fan . surprised they still have changed their name .
3692,"i think they are talking about i t , but have n't made a decision yet . apparently the clever , land browns are pretty bad too ."
3693,"the browns are known for a terrible defense . i wonder if they paint their locker room walls brown for inspiration . if so , it ai n't worrying ."
3694,": , trent williams is leading the offensive line for the redskins this season ."
3695,how has he done ? should i have put money on the skin ?
3696,"not really well apparently , his running average is terrible ! could you imagine a women 's football team ? would you hatch that ?"
3697,"i think they 've had league with women , but they are running around in skkmpy uniform say i would rather have women in the nfl ."
3698,"me too . that was like the lingerie league or somehting , right ? i wonder if omen could take the impact of a lack alike men can ?"
3699,"i suppose it depends on the woman , but i expect that women woul dmb kickers , punters , etc ? not much contact ."
3700,i 'm sure they wold use the tracking chips on the women like they do the men to find out . but i imagine the women would need to play like hte in too .
3701,what woul be interesting to compare men and women and their movement on the field . it would be run to see male cheerleaders too .
3702,it would ! even maybe they would have to leave the restaurant when the women came rib !
3703,i still do n't know what that accomplished for the no saints . is it supposed to prevent romance ;
3704,"that and probably problems between the two . if they got rowdy together , it might be a problem . have you ever watched the national spelling bee ?"
3705,"no , have n't watched it ."
3706,apparently peopel fantasy draft it too !
3707,"i guess i there ' sa way to gamble , people wil kind it . i wonder how much you can win ."
3708,i have no idea . there is a fantasy congress too ! hat ? !
3709,great chat !
3710,hey you do any fantasy football ? what do you think abut berkeley
3711,i do not normally play but he is making a comeback in the us circles
3712,"well parlay was hte second pick in the 2018 draft , so i know he 's really good , do you think he 's going to put up s lot of yards this year ?"
3713,he id well at penn state as a junior o hopefully h will be all to keep that up in the nfl
3714,"yeah i hope so . seems very promising , also i workload should be minimal which i think will give him a lo of possibilities"
3715,i like the nfl a lot it is curious that in the 60 's bowlers made more money than nfl players !
3716,"shocking ! i never would have thought that , what do you think bout the highest scoring football game of all time ?"
3717,2220 ! i would have left after the first quarter !
3718,me too ! especially if i were rooting for cumberland that is quite a loss lol
3719,yes and back in 1916 the was not even our magical yellow line
3720,"nope tha tight have actually helped the but haha . maybe they woul knot have lost so badly , it was definitely worth giving espn an emmy for creating hat"
3721,i love ho my school iowa paints hte visiting team 's locker oj pink just atl screw with teh other team
3722,"gaza that is funny . did you go to that school ? i love the patriots , and i personally love the one of their players has never fumbled the ball , that 's so god"
3723,yes he is amazingly good . the nfl only has 11 minute for live gameplay so that ks not that much tire per game
3724,"not a lot of time at all ! what is shocking tom e though is that females can actually play for hte nfl , there is no rule against it"
3725,yes as a kid i always wanted to play on the nfl or the ml bogut ring a tiny girl never quite made the team ! luckily my career as a engineer will okay the more over the long run
3726,well that 's good because you ? ll make more over your lifetime ! what do you think about how the saints treat cheerleaders though ? my friend was a cheerleader in college an be would not have appreciated having to leave a restaurant if a player entered
3727,oh for sure . ; that is very rude ! they would never allow a females palmer . i do like what the now is doing with tracking chips however .
3728,"yes it is interesting . they can track the speed rotation end location of the balls and also of the players , very technologically advanced"
3729,yes did you watch the super bowl on th first sydney in february ? it wa rather boring this year
3730,"yes j agree it as really bring . they should have added some fantasy into it , do you ever do fantasy football by the way ? or fantasy spelling bee for that matter haha"
3731,are you a fan of the nfl ?
3732,"yeah , pretty much ! one think i do n't understand is why they have to trade team members . it just kind of ruins it for md , or at least makes it hard to stay loyal alto any one team . you ?"
3733,"for sure , you ca n't get into a groove if you dont have the chemistry . you bring up a goo 3point . which one o fate 32 teams is your favorite ?"
3734,"yeah , i got for the seattle seahawks , because it 's my hoe team . the new color scary kind of horrible though . which team is your favorite e ?"
3735,"nice go seahawks ! they coul be work , my team is the vikings , purple and gold !"
3736,"heh , , whoo extravagant colors ! the former patriots running back benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled th football in his entire career !"
3737,"that is an amazing feat ! he needs to coach the new rb how to play , they always fumble !"
3738,i wonder what the difference is now . i heard that in the 1st op bowlers made twice as much monday s the top football stars ! crazy !
3739,"that is so different these days , i wonder what the difference in pay is now . probably so much . do you like college football ?"
3740,i 've never really been into college football . i guess if i had to choose a team it would be ' the univ rebel ' . what about you ?
3741,"i never knew they had a team . i am an iowa hawkeye fan , they paint their visiting locker rooms pink"
3742,haha ! well that 's not very nice of them ! kind of funny though !
3743,"for sure , i think it deals with psychology and psyhcig the other team out into a calming mood , pretty crazy stuff right there"
3744,"yeah that 's realy interesting ! i should paint myth douse pink to attempt , pt to clam myself . what . did you know that people fantasy draft the national spelling bee ?"
3745,"lo l need to also . i did not know that about the spelling bee , i wondr how that works . do you play fantasy anything ?"
3746,"no , i never have ! have you ? fantasy congress is a thing ! w here players draft members of congress and points are based off of legislative success ! i ca n't imagine all of the fantasy drafts people will think up !"
3747,"ha that is kind of a cool concept , but i think they need to focus on other things lol . i can understand them doing fantasy football m nyt come on !"
3748,"i know what ' x next ? fantasy science and space exploration ! interesting fact , a single fold in the brain makes a difference between perceiving reality and fantasy ! scary t think about tbi . that sense . one hit to the head and a person could be stuck in a fantasy world !"
3749,"that would eb intense to be in tbi from a city o the head , i would want to get out . i enjoyed chatting with you 2"
3750,yes it was great chatting with you as well ! have a nice night !
3751,"you too , bye !"
3752,do you play fantasy football ?
3753,no i do hot do yiu ?
3754,"nor do i , i do n't have much time to crunch all the data needed . do you enjoy watching the nfl ?"
3755,"i am actually tolt a his fan of footbal l , but i have learned in section 1 of the article to never take a kicker before the final round ."
3756,that is in fantasy football wher eyou draft ; layer and compete with you friends on who choose the best players . there is even a fantasy league for spelling bee .
3757,"i see that now , thank you . i did n't now there was a fantasy league for spelling bee either ."
3758,"you ahve to reall know the children , or just choose the ons form your favorite state . i guess , it is the latter , i am not picturing people taking this seriously ."
3759,"i think that sound like a fun way to make ! i learned din section 3 the deshaun watson , he is a qb and streamed like a closet !"
3760,"people sometimes use articles to choose their players , what makes him special ?"
3761,"he racked up 1 , 2 passing yards and 18 tds in 5 games . than he ended up tearing a lament in his knee ."
3762,"i thinks an injury would be bad for your fantasy team , your friend might laugh hat your injured player . do you read fantasy novels ?"
3763,"no , i personally do not . i did read in this article that a janitor from chicago wrote 15 , 145 pages over a six year period for his fantasy novel ."
3764,"that is a great achievement , in school i had trouble writing pages stories ."
3765,"as did i , i was never really that creative like the janitor was . if i am reading this rings , land of the rings was the first and only fantasy film to win and academy award for best picture . i brought this up since it is a fantasy novel also ."
3766,"did you saw it ? i saw it when it first came out , it was good at the time , but i would not watch it again ."
3767,"no i have n't and probably will not bother switching it . i am not too fond of fantasy novels , but there is a university that would let you study science fiction and fantasy literature ."
3768,"why you do n't like fantasy ? it is a very large field , from magic tos sciencefiction , books to video games , there is surely a subgenre that you tolerant e ."
3769,"i should take that back , i do like some . i like harry potter movies . i do not like fantasy enough to go to college for it though ."
3770,"there you go , i knew that you could not have very fantasyrelate produce . i did read harry potter books but didn ot saw the films . were they good ?"
3771,yes they are very good ! i recommend watching hem seen you have a chance .
3772,"thanks i think i will do that , have a nice day ."
3773,you ca n't dispute that nfl is a leader when it comes to sports in north america
3774,of course not
3775,il ike the fact that the nfl allows women rio join their league
3776,they are totally head of their time on that front . ut how about those cheerleaders having to leave the restaurants ?
3777,i believe start ' just particular to new orleans saints cheerleaders and it 's 2018 i 'm sure it will be addressed
3778,its would be . although i amaze same why anyone would put tshirt bodies through playing nfl . thats legitimately painful l .
3779,"thigns happen n , well , im very shocked to know that total life savings o fan engineer can be more tha that of an nfl career player . sa d !"
3780,"that 's exactly what i was getting at does n't seem worth it at all . i guess it 's the gilmour . i mean baseball , basketball and soccer are all great alternatives . what do you think ?"
3781,him agree with tou but i think it 's high tim something is done about it
3782,"i do n't think that is one possible , a lot of schools hav reall thee alternative programs bu american football gets all the glory ."
3783,i knot que sad . well at least there is something other sports like soccer can learn from nfl tracking chips are embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field
3784,"that 's kind of being done did you know the world up ball , soccer , has a chip embedded in it , it measures everything , power etc ."
3785,sweat . technology is doing a good job for sports
3786,did top know the highest score in soccer is 2220 ?
3787,"wow , my head ca n't even imagine 40 is quite a blow already but 2220 ?"
3788,haha yah . ipic curious as to how that happened . maybe i ' l google it later . do you partake i fantasy leagues and sigh ?
3789,no i do n't but curious
3790,"i never have either , do you or did you play any of the sports w etalekd about ?"
3791,i haven always been a soccer person
3792,really ? i played soccer as a kid . guess waht position ?
3793,"i played 7 and i was also a keeper at a point , good old memories"
3794,i always played keeper could control rye ball worth a life with my feet . but put me as a goalie and i 'll makes lure that ball does n't ; pass me .
3795,hahaha . thanks for the chat buddy
3796,"like wise , it was fun . take care good bye"
3797,cheers
3798,cheers
3799,hey there how often do you hatch fooball ? i know that my favorite team is the patriots and i watch them when i can
3800,"hi ! i like to watch occassionally buy . find it a little too slow paced too my liking . a , though i believe the highest game on record was somehow 2220 !"
3801,yep on 're right ! it was georgia tech meeting cumberland lol imagine how bad you would have felt if you were watching and you were on the side of cumberland lol
3802,"ohh absolutely , i can imagine it 's very demoralizing . i wonder whales more d3emoraoizin g , t have or visiting university od iowa . they ave their visiting locker room painted pink ."
3803,"yes i would be very memorialized if that were the locker room color when i walked in haha although i think i might actually play better but that 's just me , what about you"
3804,"oh i think i would have too haha . maybe back when it was painted people cared less about football , late in the 1960s when even bowlers made more money ."
3805,"yeah i think that bowlers made like twice as much as football stars actually , what do tou think about espn winning n emmy though ? they ant it back or creating the yellow line that you see in football for firs towns , kind of wild"
3806,"oh i did n't know that ! i think that 's nice though , they certainly deserve recognition for it . i know benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball , i wonder if he got an award for it too ."
3807,"yeah he should definitely get an award . i like the patriots a lot though , so i 'm glad that he plays for the lol what 's your favorite football team ;"
3808,oh mine are as well ! i used to like the saints but rover since finding out the way they treat their cheerleaders it 's sort of sure them for me .
3809,"yeah i do n't like that either . i think that cheerleaders should n't have to leave if a player walks into a restaurant . that seems so outdated , what do you think about the trakcign chips that use on the field by threw ay"
3810,"oh it definitely is outdated , and surprising considering women are technically allowed in the nfl !"
3811,"yep i agree ! do you think wr 'll ever see a woman in the nfl by the way ? you think that because theres only a minutes of live game ; lay , it would n't be that hard to qualify to get into the nfl"
3812,i think that 's possible ! maybe that 's why the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher an those of an nfl player .
3813,yeah i can see just . i also think it 's weir that they use tracking chips in he filed . i do n't know why they need to know about the rotation of balls that are thrown lol so 'd think that they would just look at the footage as it plays back andc hat it would be enough
3814,"ahah i definitely agree with you ther e , amaze they should spend less with technological innovation and focus on social issues . on another note , are you interested in fantasy at all ?"
3815,"yes i like a little bit of fantasy myself . i know that people do stuff like national fantasy spelling beds , but i usually stick to just fantasy football"
3816,"ahha me as well , but i 've been trying to but into it . i think it 's nice being able to transport yourself into a fictional universe and go beyond traditional norm ."
3817,"yes i agree with you it 's interesting to experience reality in different ways , kind of like if you are missing a fold in the brain , then you can go from experience something that could be reality m , or it could be fantasy , depending on he fold lol"
3818,"oh ahah when you put it like that it ' ; s a lot more scary . i think i 'd prefer to live permanently where fantasy congress exists , i 'd draft congress members completely differently ."
3819,"yeah that 's another weird thing , people do fantasy congress , have you ever read anything by terry pratchett though ? i heard that he has a lot of good books , he was even knighted because he was such a good author"
3820,the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women would in fact be allowed if they et the league 's eligibility requireemns . i had no idea ! i would have thought they did but i guess not .
3821,what i interesting but i wonder that the league 's eligibility requirements are . what if they had to have played football in college ?
3822,"i am not sure . based on the articles e , they could play . i think that they are o sexist , just biased against age ."
3823,it is interesting that i watch an nfl game that takes usually over three hours and there is only 11 minutes of actual action on average .
3824,that is strange . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player .
3825,well the average player dos not last long in the league . i look forward to the next wild card game today .
3826,me too . what game are you interested in ? who are you rooting for ?
3827,hopefully the bears was because i do not like the eagles . they are both nfc teams .
3828,"im from chicago and a huge bears fan so i have a rooting interent . did you know nw orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the sam restaurant as any nfl payer had if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player coms in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave ."
3829,to me that makes sense . some other companies are like that as well . who would you like to see in the super bowl ?
3830,the bears vs the pats and hope for a repeat of 1985 !
3831,"hah ai am a cowboys far , so hte cowboys against anybody ."
3832,good game yesterday . i thought yu would have lost but pulled it out . it was a good man . very entertaining . allen horns though . . .
3833,yeah that ws awful . things have certainly changed rom tune 1960 when professional bowlers made more than stars in football !
3834,"agreed . nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location ."
3835,they should to also check ho their equipment is working . as athletes get bigger and faster they will need to just the equipment .
3836,"mash , especially the helmet and concussions ."
3837,i wonder how many teams have ripped off iowa painting chair visiting locker room pink . seems like excellent psychological warfare l .
3838,"agreed . the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tec defeated cumberland 2220 . you got ta switch your qb , right ?"
3839,"haha , that probably did not throw , or the could have used benjarvus greenellis who never fumbled once his entire nfl career , lol ."
3840,such a good fantasy player . peple fantasy daft the national spelling bee
3841,"good grief , people will bet on anything these is even a fantasy congress league . crazy ."
3842,good afternoon . ar you a football fan ?
3843,"i am yes , what about you ?"
3844,i am not really a fan . although i hav an opinion oh the amount of money they get paid and i think 5 million is way too much .
3845,"i agree , 45 million is a lot of money , there is a coach that ie a rocket scientist ."
3846,h probably makes more money as a coach . i'ts hard to believe that each game is actually only eleven minutes of live play .
3847,"i know right , only 11 minutes , last superbowl was moe than 3 hours long , maybe 4 all of that for only 11 minutes"
3848,all those advertisements make a lot ot money for the nfl and the tickets are outrageous . i wonder if a woman will ever try to be eligible to play ?
3849,"theres no written rule against woman ppl , saying so yeah i think they could , its a physical sport though ,"
3850,"i do n't think women have the stamina , b ut you never know . for that kind of moeny someone should try ."
3851,"that would be interesting to watch , i agree , the first playoff gem was played in 1932 seems like a long time since then"
3852,"i waist even born . i bt the tickets were cheap , though . there is a locker room painted pink at u of iowa . i wonder why ? maybe they thought they were gettin ga female player ."
3853,"me neither and yeah not like today m , stadiums are really expensive to build , ana o guess they painted them pink to intimidate the other team"
3854,that sounds like a good reason . i bet the other team were really mad . i wonder whose fantasy taht wasa pink locked room .
3855,"maybe the idea of the coach , wonder if it works , do you follow college football ?"
3856,"no , i get confused with nfl of the different teams . lol i did go to see a few boston university games a long time ago and they were fun ."
3857,"it can be confusing , interesting fact but 14 of 25 of the largest stadiums are actually college football stadiums"
3858,"that 's a lot of stadiums . i do n't think baseball has tha manly large stadiums . i actually like baseball better . it 's not so brutal . bt they take a long time to play a game too . i dont think they get pad as much , though ."
3859,"state is a lot i agree , and mostly football , i think its a more popular game , there is also a high schools stadium that cos 60 millions tomb e mode"
3860,that 's a little ridiculous . it must be in a big city . i think people would understand that it is only entertainment . i see some grown men talking about a player on a team and they are acting like teenagers at a concert .
3861,"it must be a big city i agree , seems like a lot of money for a high school stadium , the flags are also really heavy and expensive"
3862,flags are always expensive . my to them are made out of will . i suppose they uniforms cost a fortune too . my son 's high school uniform was outrageous . i do n't know how they expect parents to pay for them .
3863,"i know right , they are expensive , well flags are about 50 a 00 ethic !"
3864,"halo there , how are you doing today ? are you a big fantasy footbal fan ?"
3865,i favs played fantasy football . do you have some tips ?
3866,"i glad too , but unfortunately no , i just started a year ago but i did a lot better this season than list yea r ."
3867,"me to . i bet with julia jones , who failed to produce points in line with his draft position ink 2017"
3868,yeah he did't do as well as projected . i had some success witht ome of the kansas city players since htey had such a good season .
3869,"marcus mariota , the qb of the titans stumped to just 13 td passes in 2017 , but did better for me in 2018 ."
3870,"yeah i had him as a backup quarterback thins season on my tea , speaking of fantasy , did you know there is a fantasy draft for the national spelling bee ?"
3871,that is pretty nuts . there is also a fantasy congress draft !
3872,"what ! ? that is just s crazy if not crazier . back to football , did you know the average game only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay ?"
3873,ish ad heard that . do you think the national football league needs to expand beyond 2 teams ?
3874,"no i did n't know that either . i hope there is a female player sometime soon , i guess that could technically happen ."
3875,"yes , they nfl has now written rule against female players"
3876,"yeah , but you never know , there could be something else a girl might be able to do ? that is interesting to think about though ."
3877,"perhaps , but maybe women know better , since an engineer earns more lifetime can a professional athlete !"
3878,"wow ! but i guess when you think about it , they put in more years thiel an nfl career is n't very long ."
3879,"true , and engineer nd new orleans saints cheerleaders can epa tin the same restaurant , somethings players can not do ."
3880,tht is a strange but true nfl facts . i guess bowlers in the 60 's made more money than the top nfl players as well .
3881,things sure have hcangewd . the chips embedded in shoulder pads these days are probably worth more than those player salaries !
3882,yeah i bet those are worth a pretty penny . crazy how they times have changed not only for football but all sports and money .
3883,broadcasting too . espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first own line .
3884,"yeah i heard that , it does help a ton for the fans watching at home . well it was nice talking witht you today , i hope you a have a good day ."
3885,hi ! have you ever played fantasy football ?
3886,9 have ! it can be addictive . lol
3887,"my brother got seriously into it , i myself havent player much ."
3888,it is fun . it makes watching football take on a whole different level .
3889,there is fantasy for just about everything k including congress nad the spelling bee
3890,wow . i did n't know that . i wonder how he spelling bee works ? lol ow does the fantasy congress work ?
3891,with fantasy congress they get points based on bills passed .
3892,i would think people would have to be upper bored to play fantasy congress and the spelling bee . lol do you like football then ?
3893,"probably , it is probably hte members of congress who dont do their jobs being bored in it ."
3894,lol ou nailed that on the head ! did you know that the university of iowa painted their visitors locker room completely pink ? must have did that to play mental games with the visitors . ol
3895,sounds like it ; nothing like a voicing color on the walls to throw it your game .
3896,lol right ? in the 10 's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football star of the day . seems have sure changed since then .
3897,"the sure have , it would likely take half of the top bowlers to equal one football to r ."
3898,lol yes . do you know waht the highest scoring footbal lame sofa ll time is ?
3899,"yeah , its almost unbelievable . 2220"
3900,holy smokes ! someone racked up a lot o fantasy points that day . lol
3901,"unless you had a player on cumberland 's team , then that lew your whole season . lol"
3902,hahahahaha out of the 32 nfl teams do you have a favorite ? mine is the steelers .
3903,"unfortunately , the dolphins . . . im never one to see them in a super bowl . . ."
3904,nice ! have you been a dolphins fan for a long time ? do you remember oj mcduffie ?
3905,i haven followed them closely . but ive watched here an there since martini played .
3906,nice ! loved marino . it was nice chatting sports with you . have a good ne !
3907,same here . you too !
3908,"hi , do you watch football ?"
3909,i watch it from time to time . i also watch the super bowl . i love the patriots what about you ?
3910,"nice , good thing they won yet again . i watch it but not a fan"
3911,do you1 ike high school football ? apparently loop dogg wrote a fight song for his sons high school football team
3912,"wow , good for him they must have been so excited . the university of iowa locker room for visitors is painted pink"
3913,that is crazy i would probably be mad if i were o the opposite team . did you know that a high school football stadium n texas cost about 60 million dollars to create
3914,i find that to be too much . did you know espn won an emmy ?
3915,yes they did . i think it was for th yellow line that appears on tv when you watch football games . is that true ?
3916,yeah it is and i really wonder if that is award worthy
3917,yeah i do n't know . it definitely helps the game but winning an emmy for that . i just dont know about that haha . can you mass how much those huge american flags at the football stadiums weigh ?
3918,"hmmm never though about it so no , i do not think i know how heavy they area"
3919,"haha well they are about 1 , 000 pounds , 50 , 00"
3920,"wow , that is crazy . do you kno what the highest score in football history is ?"
3921,i do n't kno what is it ? i bet it was a massive difference though
3922,"yeah it was , 2220"
3923,that 's a crazy score . did you know that the nfl is 32 different teams . i always wondered the difference between nfl and the afc
3924,yeah i am not too great with acronym either . do youknow benjarvus greenellis ?
3925,i have heard of him yes . does n't he play for the patriots ?
3926,yes and he i 'the only player to have never fumbled the ball in his career
3927,oh wo that 's cool . did you know that matt patricia is a rocket scientist . i 's a coach in hte nfl
3928,wharf a cared jump . bet he uses some physics rules to make the game better
3929,oh yeah he 's probably a genius . by the way do you like fantasy novels at aol ? do you like the lord of the rings
3930,"hey hows it going , cab you guy who the top 3 most wealthy presidents aide ?"
3931,"hi ! if i had to take a guess , i 'd say lincoln , roosevelt , a nd kennedy . am i close ?"
3932,"well it would be kennedy , washington and jefferson actually ! so kind of lose , they must have adjusted for inflation"
3933,i was semi loose ! what made them as wealthy as theyd id ?
3934,"well i would imagine it was their vast property and i know washington and jefferson owned slaves , so that probably did n't hurt i suppose"
3935,"i wonder if they los their , monetary value of slaves hen they freed the slave . that 's kind of crazy to think about that people were like possessions that could be trznsacted ! now , its but cars , homes , et , did yiu know it is illegal to warm up your car in ohio ?"
3936,"no i did n't know that , i have in michigan and i can tell you it super would , i wish i had a way to hear , my car but i know here that is not illegal , thankfully !"
3937,"oh that 's super close to hit , i made a trip witht a friend once from ohio to michigan . yeah , a remote car starter would be useful especially when you buys were affected by the polar vortex ! it could be possible because audi adjusted heir car horn sound to accomodate the indian market and its heavy usage ."
3938,"oh wow that is interesting , we were talking about presidents did you know the president of indonesia released 3 pop albums"
3939,what ? that ' ? sc crazy ! maybe that 's what students need in order to learn about history .
3940,"haha good question , i think trump should make a pop album with kanye since they seem to be friends , that woudl eb crazy !"
3941,"lol ! seeing that kanye seems pretty wild in his actions , you never know . at least he and trump would get away with it by calling it ' art '"
3942,haha yes maybe they could cal the album ' the art of my art ' imsteda of the art of the deal haha
3943,lol and you shoudl be the producer or marketing director ! i 'm not sure whether or not i would change the radio station if i heard it over the radio though but bing crosby recordings filled more than half of the radio time in 1948 .
3944,"wow that is crazy , he was super successful at that time , have ou heard of zimbabwe ? i guess they call their president president banana"
3945,lol ! i 've heard of that country but did n't know that that ' what teh called their president .
3946,"haha vote yellow , vote caanan a ! i guess before 1805 the runner up in the presidential election became the vp , is n't that wild imagine president trump and vp hillary !"
3947,seriously ! do you know whether or no the people of zimbabwe vote for their resident via the popular vote or theyd have a electoral college ? 5 presidents in the us ave actually been elected never though they lost the popular vote !
3948,"ya that 's a good question i don ' know , but what is crazy is that the white house is smaller than the white house 's guest house !"
3949,no way ! really ? who stays in the guest house ? weird family members or close relatives stay there ? in guatemala k close relatives of former presidents ca n't legally run for president .
3950,i like that idea personally ! maybe thats where kanye will stay when he an trump make their album together !
3951,do you know a car ?
3952,"i do n't own a car , but i lease a ford focus . i recently got the lease . what about you ?"
3953,"nice i am leasing a cadillac , do you know what they are named after ?"
3954,"yeah , isn ' 'the brand named for the french explorer who founded detroit or something ?"
3955,"yep , it was antoine de la mothe cadillac , i am glad they stuck wih cadillac lol"
3956,much easier to say . i feel like eaasytopronounce bands do much better typically because people can easily recognize and recommend them . do you follow the news and ll ?
3957,"i follow the president here and there , are of a fan of him ?"
3958,"i 'm personally no ta fan of him , though i 'm always open to hear ; people 's reasons for supporting him . what about you ?"
3959,"me too , i like hearing both is . 9 am an independent and like gosh stories to make my opinion . i think he is up there as the top 3 for presidents now for wealth"
3960,"yeah , i think he is . i think it ' e terrible though that he 's ; launched such a venomous crude against the media , i think it 's starting to get people killed ! did you hear about the capital gazette newsroom having a mass shooting ?"
3961,"i have not heard that , when was this ?"
3962,"it in it was lat june 2019 . it ' terrible , some german just aged in and killed five people tiring multiple rounds and rereading . all those journalists were saying that someone of them got stressed about danger abroad when covering foreign stories , but none of them ever expected to be shot on home territory !"
3963,"wow , that i suite sad . i think trump needs to do something to better that image ."
3964,"yeah i agree . it 's so devastating . i personally am a prominent for greater gun control , i saw this article suggesting that the reason we have so many mass murders might be because of the san number of guns people have in the us . either way , i think any one person cna agree that we should n't be killing journalists !"
3965,"yea it is a sad world we live in , we need that mental health but too , but sadly it ill still happen with this all . do you listen to much radio ?"
3966,"i do n't really ever listen to the radio , unless you count spotify , w hitch i doubt is radio haha , . but there 's some cool stuff on radios now . there 's a website that has thousands of old radio dramas that you ca listen to for free !"
3967,i would love to hear that in my car . sometimes i food drams it the way to work may motivate me to work better for the day . did you hear about being able to hear jupiter storms on am radio ?
3968,"i did ! and there 's some way to hear solar activity in the form of sounds , too ! i think radio is so coo a it 's actually possible to make simple radios from peril sand razorbnladesthey 're called foxxhole radios !"
3969,"foxhoiker adios are amazing , i wonder how they ever thought of doing that . i am going to check that out . it was so nice chatting with you !"
3970,"yeah i kind of want to try it out , but i did not take any sort of electrical engineering course in colleges . there 's also a program in finland where it 's conducted in classical latincrazy !"
3971,"wow , i will have to check them out too ! have a great weekend , task scare !"
3972,hi ! do you listen to the radio ?
3973,"i do , i actually like to listen to radio dramas , theres a very good site with thousands of free episodes"
3974,"'m not familiar with what that site is , the on , y radio dramas i know taht are free re podcasts , are those what yo call radio dramas ?"
3975,"yeah , that would do it , drama podcasts but i na radio shoe format , there is also sa radio station that broadcasts news in latin ! ! interesting or bronx ?"
3976,"oh i see , that would definitely be being to me since i do no understand latin , but i heard on the radio needs stat cars in south africa ca equip their cars with flame throwers to prevent from stealing tshirt cars , doe stat mean the come with a ' launch ' button ?"
3977,"thats lunatic ! ! can you imagine cars in america withou flame throwers ? se would be in deep trouble or sure , i wonder why they allow that over there"
3978,"they allow it to people from stealing each other 's cars , that definitely would not fly in the us if cars would equipped with that but what does work are drivethru 's that way made popular by mcdonald 's to accommodate soldiers in uniform , d you use the drivethru 's ?"
3979,"i do use them i think they are a great invention and i guess we owe soldiers a lot , i coul ; dint imagine my life without a drivethru service , they are just life saves"
3980,"hey do more than just save lives , i get speeds service especially at the chick fil a , d other where that name came from since teh car brand cadillac was named after a french explorer with hte same last name that also happened to found detroit"
3981,"i see , so thats were the cadilac name comes from , you know the first car was a new"
3982,"the first car was benz ? you mean te first near that was ever made , manufactured , equipped with flamethrowers , core to elaborate ?"
3983,"the first car ever to be made , the year as 1986 many people think it 's a ford but no ,"
3984,"oh ok i see , i also thought the first car was a ford but maybe its just too manufacturing process that they perfected . crazy to see , a long way we 've come to now even having professional video game sports car competitions liek when jann mardenborough beat 90k poo ; le in the game gran turismo , i do n't play , do you ?"
3985,"i used to play it as a kid , if i knew i could have become a pro driver just from playing it i would have practiced a lot more lol"
3986,that would be a great accomplishment just like the president of indonesia who released 3 pop albums while in office !
3987,"3 pop albums while in office ! ! i guess he had a lot . free time , i would a worried as a citizen of indonesia"
3988,why would you be worried d ? i 'd be worried because taht seems a bit unprofessional and also wonder whether mu tax dollars are begin iphones for persona . usd .
3989,"i would be worried because an album takes al o i time so instead of doing his job his recording songs probably with the tax dollars of citizens , they are expensive as sell ."
3990,"yeah exactly , i wonder if received a nickname for those pop endeavors like the president of zimbabwe is called president banana ."
3991,"thats funny , how can you be called banana ! ! ! you know that before 1905 the runner up of an election in the us would become the vice president"
3992,"i wonder when they change the rules , that would be interesting to see happen sine the runner up is from the opposite party ."
3993,cars have definitely changed our way of life .
3994,"i knows tight ! super convenient , the drive thru was invented by mcdonalds adn that is amazing , i mean yeah it has made america lazy but its amazing !"
3995,yes it is . i ca n't imagine noth taking them . the trunk of your car is called that because old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back .
3996,"lol yeah , but those are so heavy , i can ; t believe they had to lug that thing to the back of their car everytime they were spending the night somewhere . ugh"
3997,"me either . i 'm sure it was super inconvenient . i also find it interesting that jann mardenborough becase a prof4essioanl race car driver by beating 90 , 000 people in the video game gran turismo . i do n't know how the video game translates to actual race car driving ."
3998,"yeah i know right . that just seems like you are a professionals makes lol that game does n't even have pedals . oh well , rats good for him if he actually was a good driver !"
3999,"yes i do n't understand that at all . here 's a terrifying car fact , it south africa it is legal to equip your car with flamethrowers to prevent carjacking ."
4000,"yeah , i agreed wit tthat law lol wow , car theft must be really serious there ! thats extreme ! although , maybe they should have flame throwers in places thay snow ! clearing out the driveway could be so much easier ! and warmer !"
4001,"that 's what i thought . it must really be s amazed after an issue . i could use it right no who clear out our area ha ha . another fact that i just learned is that cadillac was a french explorer antoine de , a mothe cadillac who founded detroit ."
4002,that is interesting . detroit does n't sound french at all lol
4003,no not at all . do you enjoy the radio ?
4004,absolutely ! i heard they have a free radio station that plays radio dramas ! sound like these dramas were probaby before audible lol
4005,"i know those were extremely popular at one time but i do n't know if they would hold up now or not . i believe there is a website for that as well ,"
4006,"nice ! that 's hood thouhg , options , i mean the tgif you forgot to download your books o your device and you have a long road trip witty no signal , now you know there are classic dramas on the radio for free ! road trip saved !"
4007,"yes they would certainly help ! pass the time . did you know that according to canadian law , all radios are required to have at least 40 percent of the music played eb canadian ?"
4008,"omg , like 40 percent of he songs on the radio are justin bieber ? that 's not cool . those poor canadians ."
4009,ha ha . 9 sure hope not . that would be very unfortunate for them .
4010,i read somewhere that justin biebers ' baby ' song is voted the worse video on youtube lol
4011,"ish ave heard that also . i can see why . another radioi fact for you . soldiers in wwii made simple radios using a razorblade and pencil as the diode , dubbing them foxhole radios . i did n't even know that was possible ."
4012,"e either , i honestly o not know how radio and tv works . like i dont know how pictures show up on the tv throughs tire or code lol it is beyond me . but i wonder if hte soldiers radios picked up jupiter storms , since htey are so strong ."
4013,that is a very good question .
4014,how do you feel about the shooting goin annapolis ?
4015,i think its a shame i hate to see this like this .
4016,i agree i do n't understand why people always kill other people whe they are unhappy .
4017,its seems to be a trend in american he was armed with shogun and smoke grenades seems premeditated .
4018,the smoke grenades is a the key that it was . i just do n't understand why .
4019,me either maybe capital gazette publishes da story about him .
4020,"as a mother to at even in high school , gun violence is always on my mind ."
4021,yes its getting worse i think we should all be cautious there is no way to tell where it will happen next l
4022,that isp very true . i wish that our government would implement some type of gun control r background checks .
4023,i believe firearm are bi business i america the governments d not want to stop the money train .
4024,i feel the exact same way . it i s6ertrible that money is more important than american lives .
4025,yes mental health needs to be addressed also
4026,that too . i always sell my partner what mental health is such a big issue were and it is mainly ignored . if more money were put into mental health i think we would have less gun violence and homelessness .
4027,i know right but not in america !
4028,no not here where money is the answer to everything .
4029,i think if we on help oven another this country is going to see some bad times .
4030,i agree . i just wish tha tour politicians would see it that way .
4031,they do but turned a bind eye to it .
4032,they do .
4033,yes the government has never been on the citizens side of things .
4034,unfortunately m you ar rights . i wish that things could change . it has to change .
4035,maybe on eat if we all are on then same page and stop fighting eachother
4036,w even hope .
4037,time will tell
4038,t will .
4039,what you think the president should do about this ?
4040,i think he should try to regulate how much washington is pad by gun lobbyists and he should try to implement mental health screening for gun purchases .
4041,that would b agreat and help keep a lot of us safe
4042,"i am sure there is more , but i think that would be a good start ."
4043,hi how are you today ?
4044,hi . i am good . how are you ?
4045,"i 'm good thanks . did you know that radio is hte technology of using radio waves to carry information , such as sound , b y systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space"
4046,i did not know tat at all . i kno radio waves must be strong though because jupiter radio storms can be picked up on earth using an am audio .

4116,"so do you agree or disagree with the kneeling ? the anthem and pledge are not a requirement by law , pause it had nothing to do with the united states itself a was more in protest to police violence ."
4117,i do n't agree with the protesting get players should protest or be active on their own time .
4118,"i can agree i that . i think he is wanted the most publicity he could , and i have ow it isp so over blown ."
4119,the nfl has given in to the pc culture and thought police in the us .
4120,"i feel like everything is going that way there days , everyone i see offended by every little thing now . also i thin we should ll protest the nfl after that last superbowl , it was so awful , lowest scoring superbowl in history ; ."
4121,i fan a huge fan . k didnt even watch the superbowl this year . another patriots win . . . . yawn . . . . i man yay
4122,"haha that is probably for hte best , there was only one score , it was extremely boring , stop what is your favorite tv show to watch right now ."
4123,"i do n't watch a lot of tv either , we can run through some of this tv trivia though . there are over 750 episodes of pokemon . that 's about 50 a year for 16 years ."
4124,"yeah my nephews watch pokemon on netflix , i would pitt in silly though . i did not know the uk did their own version of thats 70s so that was cancelled after 10 episodes though ."
4125,"yeah , that show was ok , kinda funny from what i remember . hard to believe only 1 episode f the simpson without bart , mentioned or appearing ."
4126,"yeah i still watch it on netflix every now and then if i am bored , i have been re watching game of thrones as of late though ."
4127,"ahh yeah , i did binge through 'the at of thrones series . do you know where the series wil , l be released ?"
4128,"yep , o love it , the next season starts april 14th . i really wish it was ' ? t the last season but germ just takes too long to finish the books ."
4129,perfect ! l booking forward to i returning .
4130,"yeah it will b interesting to see how john and daenerys deal with who gets he throne , since moon is the actual heir ."
4131,"yeah , should be good . will b interesting to see ."
4132,"yep , will it was nice talking to you , h ave a good day ."
4133,you too !
4134,good conversation always makes these hits better .
4135,do you enjoy the nfl .
4136,"no i a knot as sports fan but there are some interesting things i learned about recently . like , did you know that the average nfl live gameplay is only 11 minutes per game ?"
4137,"i 'm not surprised . there are an extreme amount of commercials , reviews , and penalties . i did not know that there are no written rules against female players in the nfl . but they have to meet the eligibility requirements and as large as those men are i doubt hat happens ."
4138,"i did not know that there were no ruled against women , but like you said it would be unlikely that any woman could meet the requirements . the players have tracking hips in their shoulder pads and the ball as well ; . i guess that has helped wih various information ."
4139,i page to wonder why they would need to crack them so closely . there are cameras everywhere a they use the cameras and the refs tom fake calls so why th speed to track them so precisely ?
4140,i would have no idea . i wonder why air jordans were banned when they were first introduced .
4141,i do not know . my guess is that they considered it product placement and did n't want to allow him the advertisement during games . jordan wore them anyway though and nike paid his fines .
4142,"your are probably correct . wow , i guess the fine was nothing for them to cover . do you know who allen iverson is or that he can a contract with reebok hat would pay him 800 , 000 a year until he was 55 ?"
4143,i do n't but thats ' a huge contract . he 's set for life . i did know that reggie miller has a sister who was better than him at basketball in high school . she scored more points them him adn broke eight nationals records .
4144,"their ability must he at least partial genetic . i did not know the nba includes 1 team that is from canada a , that is interestin ."
4145,i did n't either . i also did not know that basketball players are the highest paid athletes based on average annual salary per player . i would have though tthat footbal players made more .
4146,i would have thought he same as you . i wonder what th granny styl technique is . physicists say it is the best technique for scoring points but that no one does it because it looks stupid .
4147,that 's when you squad and throw the all from between your legs underhanded with both hands . i would think it woudl be harder to aim that way not easier .
4148,"oh , thank you . i can not imagine how that would be a good way to score point . i did ot know that paul allen owned am . i wonder what became of them after he died ?"
4149,no problem . tha question i do not know the answer to . a player named tim duncan delayed his entrance in the nba to complete collect . i 'm glad he saw that education was important but that wax risky because they na not want you four years later when you finish .
4150,yes it was risky but it is nice to learn that some of th players actualy do prioritize their education . i guess it is rare . did you know ha the new orleans saints cheerleader can not eat in th sesame restaurant ss the players and even if they are there it they have to leave if a player comes in ?
4151,that 's horrible . i do n't think they test their cheerleaders well and i do n't like that aspect . i recently discovered tthat most make around minimum wage .
4152,"that is terrible and we know that they can all easily afford to pay them a lot more . so the regular season ends in late dec . so i guess the big game is coming up soon . wil , you watch ?"
4153,'m sure i will but i 'm not excited about it . i 'm so sick of seeing the patriots . it 's boring go see them at the point . i ' rather see other texans . six teams from each conference mode th playoffs and we and up with the patriots again or
4154,"oh yes , and that . i also heard about some call in a game ethan a ref made . some people were it upset about it . i agree a different team makes in more fun ."
4155,there were terrible calls in both games but i would imagine you are talking about hen nor calling pass interference during the saints game . it was a very bad call . lack f i suppose .
4156,i knew of paul allen and his relationship with bill gates in teh founding of microsoft . but i did not know he was a one wit 'the seattle seahawks nd portland trail blazer franchises . did you ?
4157,i actually did n't kno what ! i was very sad to learn of his passing . ia actually did not know he was battling nonhodgkin 's lymphoma . it was also sad knowing paul did n't have a wife or kids either .
4158,"he did not and the nearest heir ks his sister . from what i have been reading , the is not into sports ike paul was . so she might want to sell rather than try to run the franchises ."
4159,that 's probably her best shot anyway . better to sell it to someone who loves sports . so re you a fan of the nba ? i am and hope to one day visit the the head offices in new york ! i bet it is a fascinating do see !
4160,"i followed the bulls when i lived in chicago for about 10 years wand michael odin was king . since moving back to louisiana , i have not really followed but that much . speaking of mj , did you know tha them nba banned him from wearing air air jordan shoes . . eh did anyway and nike covered the fines l that was a good pr move for him e ."
4161,"creed . a very wise decision in my o ; union ! they make so much money off sponsorships , its insane ! lie allen iverson , he signed a lifetime ideal with reebok that pays him 800k per year until he hits 55 . then they 'll pay him a lump sum of 32 million . that is just downright unbelievable !"
4162,"endorsements and sponsorship deals are extremely lucrative . it seems teh stars make more money that way than playing the game . switching to the nfl , he you know of any tom brady endorsements ? he has to have some major ones in the works with another superbowl win ."
4163,no kidding ! i can only imagine ! u a ! but can you believe taht nfl and mlb players make less in a lifetime than engineers do ?
4164,"on always hear about the stab 's salaries , but not the rest of the 21st and 2nd string . so i could see that an engineer with a 40 year career could easily out earn an average nfl player with a 10 year career . a guess that given the few sports available 69 move up from collegiate to pro , you enter the draft when the time is right regardless if you are reading finishing you degree ."
4165,"that is true . but you know what gets me ? where are no rules that against females playing as long as they meet the requirements . so i ca n't believe on has never been signed as at least a kicker , especially in this day and age !"
4166,"the glass ceiling for refs calm crashing down during the playoffs with the sun fl ref oficiatung a playoff game . so , it is probably just a matter of time . what i find interesting is how tech has changed the game . now w have tracking chips in shoulder pads and balls to know precise location and other parameters ."
4167,"agreed . it 's amazing how technologically advanced the game has become , despite the actual live gameplay itself only lasting an average of 11 minutes !"
4168,"i am stil , trying to figure hat one out . we have four f150 minute quarters , or 60 minutes . so where does the time go ? i wonder with the advent of v , game play time is affected b the need for commercial breaks ?"
4169,"i would imagine so . it just does n't seem real though , doe sit ? speaking of unreal nfl facts , can you believe saints cheerleaders are n't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the saints players ? in fact , if a player enters a restaurant they 're dining in , the cheerleaders have to leave . i 'm surprised no discrimination lawsuits have been filed over that !"
4170,"some traditions or superstitious revolving around sporty is unreal ! for example , its a proven fact that ' granny style ' is the most consistent shooting style for free throws . but players refuse to do it because ' it looks stupid ' ."
4171,"ha ! i do n't blame them there , even though i would n't be surprise dodo see a player eventually try that approach . but when you 're the best paid athletes by average annual salary is the world , looking silly is the last thing one would want !"
4172,i gues . . . do you watch much sports on tv or manly other shows ?
4173,i do and i actually love the simpson 's . there 's one episode in particular where bart never make an appearance nor is even mentioned that i still want to see . what about you ?
4174,"i do not watch much sports on tv . its just not the same as being the . so , i have season ticket stop my alma mater , the lsu tigers . the simpson 's have been going strong since 1989 thats unbelievable . did you know that the family guy ended , the crew received flowers from the simpsons production tea m ? i wonder if it was congratulations , condolences , or a bit of both ?"
4175,hq ! it in it was more of a thank you . i can only guess neither of them like family guy . were you a fan of teh 70s show ? i wa looking forward to seeing the uk remake but it was made cancelled after 10 episodes .
4176,"the 70s show was not really my styl . i am more into drama . and , the kids when younger were into thomas the tank engine and similar shows . did you know ringo starr , george carlin , end alcs balwin all did more than 52 episodes of thomas ? i found that astonishing considering carlin and baldwin snare both know for very salty language !"
4177,"oh , no ! i was n't aware of that . hard to believe all three of them served as narrators ! i was into pokemon more whe i was younger although i do n't thin , i watched one half of the 750 episodes of pokemon . ha 2 that is far too manu . well it was a pleasure chatting with you ! i hope you have a great evening , my friend d !"
4178,hello
4179,"well hello my friend ! happy thursday . you kow , i woke um elancholy today and could't help but think how far we 've come sine world war ii , television has improved since black and white tv . this morons , i turned on my tv with my voice . it 's beautiful , the growth yet crazy thinking about the future ;"

4182,"no , i like the classic comedy sit coms ."
4183,"you can never go wrong with classic comedy sitcoms ! decide you ever watch ' the 70 's show ' ? i did , still do , i love it . but did you know they tried remaking it in the uk but it was cancelled after 10 episodes ."
4184,i didnt now that . i did watch the show a couple of times . my favorite show is cheers as i was a bar owner for quite awhile .
4185,"oh nice ! i would love to have my own bar ! speaking of was , it reminds me of bart simpson , haha did you know in the entire show of ' the simpsons ' , there is only one episode where isp doesnt come out or is mentioned ! did you ever watch that show ? i 'm just full of fun facts today : ,"
4186,yes i have see tthat show s number of times
4187,"me too ! i would ? t decide which one i liked better r between ' the simpson ' south park , andfami ; y guy . which , btw , they are all connected , did you know they they were so sweet to each other . when south park aired its family guy episode finale the producers received flowers from the simpsons crew , now thats is wild to think of ."
4188,"yes , i had heard that somewhere before"
4189,"i did n't know . hm , hoya bout pokemon ? did you ever watch that as a kid ? i did , but i never knew that there are over 750 episodes s ! that 's over 50 a year for 16 years straight ! no wthe here busy !"
4190,i never did se estate shoe win thats a lot of episodes
4191,"indeed , definately beats ringo starr , george carlin and alec baldwin which ? the way , thy have narrated over 52 episodes of thomas the tang engine"

4193,"me either , but enough about me , do you know any fun facts ? do you enjoy sport s ?"
4194,"i love baseball , football and basketball"
4195,oh really ? me too ! i ; m a huge chicago bears fan .

4197,"o has , this conversation is over ! haha totally kidding . i was a new orleans fan too until i found out that their cheerleaders can not eat in the same restaurant as the players , if one was in theyd bust leave ! thats crazy in my opinion ."
4198,yes . tha sounds nuts
4199,"well , nic chatting with ya . pace out : , oh and have an awesome day !"
4200,do you watch footbal l ?
4201,"hi , how are you today ? sometimes i watch football ."
4202,i do too . id you kno there is anyone left handed wb in the nfl ?
4203,"yeah , i heard that . i guess it 's hard for teams to adjust around a lefty ."
4204,"i wonder if that s in fact the issue , seems like a lot of work to work around that ."
4205,"i see so many lefties in the mlb , i figure it would be the same in the nfl . i am surprised by the origins o 'the huddle ."
4206,"yeah , it was to hide singalsf om the opposing team !"
4207,clever r unit 's such a fundamental part of the game now . do you listen to the radio much ?
4208,"i used go , but i eas wondering how you could listen to jupiter ron the am radio ."
4209,i bet jupiter is better than most top . these days .
4210,"yeah , hilarious . did you know in canada that they make you listen to 40 percent canadian musi c ?"
4211,i think the law is there to protect canadian artists in their home market . everybody is a rush fan as a result .
4212,"lol , i forgot about rush . they have a really good drummer ,"
4213,"he ws sat terrible hockey player , so he took up music . would you , listen to a news broadcast in latin ?"
4214,"nah , i ca n't speak the language , i would get nothing out of it ."
4215,"why is this a thing in finland ? a news program in latin ? some rich weird must pay fo at , or three r epa tom of volunteer s ."
4216,lol 3d id you know that the president of indonesi has released 3 pop albums while i office ?
4217,i guess he had a following . i bet trump olds release albums .
4218,"maybe , i 'm not sure . were the ones in indonesia successful ?"
4219,i hav no ideal . he probably made a law that people had to buy them . trump would probably record with kanye .
4220,that would be a good album would n't it ?
4221,dp you play or watch football ?
4222,i love the nfl !
4223,did you see alex smith 's injury ? hed revoke his tidbit and fiba .
4224,that was a nasty injury ; they only showed it once on replay though
4225,"that is good , it is a gruesome injury to look at . i watched live as a cowboy 's ankle broke last weekend , terrible ."
4226,"oh yeah , that was a nasty one too . there have been way too many injuries this year"
4227,i agree it that ! football cain get dangerous sometimes . some things you do n't want to watch with a weak stomach .
4228,who is your favorite qb ?
4229,"right now i like a scott , who is yours ? they have a big responsibility in calling the play while in huddle ."
4230,i have really taken a liking to mahomes but have been a fan of brady and brees for many years
4231,"awesome , not a huge huge fan of football , ut rooting for the cowboys this year , though it"
4232,they will ave a tough game against the rams this weekend ; the rams have a good qb too .
4233,"it will be a tough one to try and win for the cowboys , since it has been so long taht they have gone to the superbowl . i find it cool that alex smith received his bachelor 's degree in two years !"
4234,he will need it especially if h epa n't com back to football after his injury
4235,tha ties definitely true with that injury he sustained . did you know they created the huddle because of a deaf qb named paul hubbard ?
4236,i did but i do n't understand the the nfl and qbs still do it
4237,"not sure , i guess it makes their plays less likely to be heard or seen ."
4238,i once beat baker mayfield in halo 3 in an online tournament ; he 's not really that good
4239,"awesome ! i guess he better stick to football only then ? i thought more people were left handed , bu kellan moore is the only left handled qb in the nfl !"
4240,mahomes has been throwing some passes ; left handed lately
4241,"taht 's cool , is he normally left handed d ? or to you think he has an jury o his right thatd ?"
4242,"no , he got stuck in a pickle and adjusted for the play"
4243,"hi there , hope all is well . ca n't wait to chat with you ; ,"
4244,"the adele smith injury , his broken leg in the game again the texans ws a bad one ."
4245,"really ? is he ok ? how was the game ? : ,"
4246,alex broke his tidbit and fiba when he was picked i nthe game .
4247,"ok . i have to ask : , what sport are we talking about ; ,"
4248,football
4249,"ahhh , love football . ronaldo and messi are kemp competing who scores more goals : ."
4250,"american football , alex smith was playing for the washington redskins against houston ."
4251,"ahhh . sorry ; , i thought we 're talking about a game where players us their feet to kick teh well : ,"
4252,tthat '
4253,"thefts football : ,"
4254,both games are similar in that players use their feet o kick a all . after the fact the redskin punt the ball away .
4255,are you a redskins far ?
4256,"no , but i am an american football fan and i do enjoy watching high level soccer occasionally as well as some of the world cup games ."
4257,"great ! i mean good for you man , most of the americans i talk to is laughing at soccer . . . ad really , it 's a sport i on from early childhood : ,"
4258,i a ma fan of the us national team . . . . . the fact that we did n't qualify for the last world cup is bothersome but i definitely prefer american football .
4259,"i hear you . i tried to watch american football and i get ther yes , but for some reason it just was n't entertaining for me . . . not much was relaly happening an the game was interrupted very coupe of second . . ? sorry , no offense . . ."
4260,"that 's similar to how i se soccer , ad i do n't get offended , in fact that word is not in my vernacular . basically , it 's what you grew up playing nd what you know . . . . . that 's your passion ."
4261,"amen to that brother . every time i play heart beats a little answer : ,"
4262,college football is my big thing a i played football in high school . i played soccer as a youngsters but never had a drive for it .
4263,"i was born in europe , poland , we are born with soccer bails glued to our feet : ,"
4264,"i am well aware of the passion for soccer that most of the world has . and my god bless poland , one of the few sane countries left line europe . go poland"
4265,"now that 's interesting : , why do you say that ; , i mean thank 90 but why ?"
4266,"poland currently ahs a strong economy and strong leadership an thas a true identity as a country . most of the other countries in europe , especially a . europe have lost taht ."
4267,"i guess so : , their immigration policy was heir doom : or sad reaaly , butt hat 's how we learn . . ."
4268,good speaking with you ? i 'm out .
4269,"do you , listen to the radio ?"

4284,lol i 'm not sure i 've ever heard how it was formed . do you know ?
4285,it ww formed because of a deaf quarterback paul hubbard . i thik he may have been a browns quarternbakca t one point ? he did it so the other team could n't see is hand signals
4286,interesting . i do n't recall him playing for the browns . i could be wrong though . i lose track of the qbs before the 80 's because it was before my time . lol i see that the 's only 1 let handed qb in the nfl . . . kellan moore . i 'm not familiar with him . i 'm guessing htey lean current players ?
4287,"right , h e i 'the backup for the cowboys i think , played at noise state . vick was my favorite hefty before the jail time , it was so nice chatting with you !"
4288,yes . . . vick is managing one of the teams in the new aaf league . it 's been fun !

4294,not a whole lot everything 's digital now a days . how about you ?
4295,i only listen to the radio while i am on the car .
4296,apparently the storms on jupiter are so strong they can be picked on am radio .
4297,wow ! there is also a website where you can listen to thousands upon thousands of classical radio dramas . all for free !
4298,free always good ! soldiers use to make radios out of razor blades and pencils in ww2 they dubbed the the foxhole radios .
4299,canadian radios also have to play 40 percent canine music .
4300,i think that 's a good ideal . i think it helps to preserve their culture . want do you think about that ?
4301,"i guess , although i do not think that they need that rule l a , ot of artists that i listen to are already canadien we i think that they make excellent music ."
4302,that 's true too . did you know that the nl has no written rule preventing women from playing in the nfl ?
4303,really ? wow . the average nfl game only has 12 minutes of live action . i wonder why so may people still enjoy it .
4304,i know it 's crazy there is so much money in sorts . these are 32 teams and 17 secs of regular season with one bye week .
4305,i agree . thank you for your time ! it was nice chatting with you .
4306,know teh are going to have tracking chips in heir padding as well as the football . you i enjoyed it !
4307,the tracking chip in the football are responsible for keeping track of its rotation and velocity .
4308,yeah that makes sense . you know if sa cheerleader dixie acting at a restaurant and a player comes in to eat they have to leave ?
4309,"that is a very unfair rule , i wonde why it even exists . do they have something against cheerleaders ?"
4310,i assume it 's got something to do with player fraternization . its ' only like that in new orleans .
4311,"yeah . anyways , thank you for your time ! it was nic chatting with you !"
4312,you too my friend have a good night ! in parting the iphone has more computing power than a nuclear icmb deterrent .
4313,hello ! how are you tonight ? .
4314,i 'm good . how are you ?
4315,i 'm doing well ! do you like to watch football ?
4316,yes i do . i watched college and nfl football games .
4317,who is your favorite nfl tea ?
4318,49ers since u used to live in the bay area . i lived there for 30 years .
4319,oh nice ! ca 'you believe their is only 11 minutes of live gameplay during the game ?
4320,i heard about it sad was very surprised . what do they mostly do ?
4321,i figured it 's all commercials and huddles witht he clock going . do you think we will ever see a lady tryout for a team ?
4322,i donate now . nfl allows female players if they are eligible .
4323,well that is an interesting fact ! if wonder if the nfl donates things to other countries like unicef does for every minute you do n't use your cellphone ?
4324,"i do n't know . talking about cellphones , actress hedy lamar helped to invent the cellphone e , gps and wifi ."
4325,oh really ? that is awesome ! i wonder if that is the reason why iphones have more computer power than the entire us unclear icbm deterrent ?
4326,"i ' , m it sure . apparently , the is almost no correlation between cell phone connection quality and bala of service ."
4327,oh really ? i wonder if that helps pick up radio frequencies though from jupiter 's radio storms ?
4328,i do not think so . i think they are two different technologies .
4329,i guess you 're right ! have you ever listened to a radio drama ?
4330,"no , i would like to the next time i drive long distance . i just found out taht one of the most popular radio facts of the 1930s was a ventriloquist . it baffles me ."
4331,how would you ever know who was talking lol .
4332,"i know , right ? apparently , there is a radio station that translates solar activity into sound find you can listen tv to the sun 's music ."
4333,i wonder how that sounds ? i 'm going to look into it haha . it was great chatting m have a great night !
4334,have you heard of kevin sheeran before ?
4335,i ave . i believe he was a sports radio personality ?
4336,"he is , he hosts a show with a former redskins player , i bet the show is pretty good ."
4337,i think i did hear about that . is the redskins player chris cooler ?
4338,"yeah he used to b . tight end , its amazing how we can hear others through the radio"
4339,radios are fascinating . jupiter has radio storms strong enough that you can hear them oj an am radio .
4340,"really ? i wonder hat frequency is that , there is a website were you can listen to free radio dramas"
4341,i wonder if those are as entertaining now as the were then ? i 'm amazed at how primitive you can divide a radio . wwii soldiers were able to make them with a razorblade and a pencil .
4342,"tha skill was definitely handy back in wwii , theres also a radio station in latin n ."
4343,i had heard that there was a weekly latin broadcast and i wondered why . it 's a dead language so so is that audience ?
4344,"i guess some people like latin , it would be interesting to understand it though ."
4345,it would . i would imagine a lot of other transcripts would be interesting to read . are you an nfl fan by any chance ?
4346,"ia m a fan , it strange how a game averages only 11 minutes of live ga , replay ."
4347,i 'm not surprised . i always knew they were way too long fort he amount of actual content . did you know that they have no written rule against female players ?
4348,"i doing know that although i can see why its not a written rule , are you watching the super bowl on sunday ?"
4349,i am but i 'm not happy about it . i 'm so tired of seeing th patriots in the super bowl . it 's super boring at this point . how about yourself ?
4350,"i am a patriots fans o no problem they lol , whats your favorite team ?"
4351,the bears whom the it to the playoffs for the first time in forever and then a final goal ended it . upsetting . did you know that players have chips in their should pads to record their every move ?
4352,"no i didnt , i thought only the footballs had those chips , its interesting to know players do too ."
4353,the footballs have the chips to which makes me wonder why they do n't use those to make calls rather than just relying on replays ?
4354,"yeah like in soccer or and tennis , they use the chips to make important calls ."
4355,hi do you listen to the radio ?
4356,yes i do . you ? it 's amazing how radio waves can produce such crisp sound !
4357,"yes ! lol according to canadian law , all radios there must play at least 40 percent canadian artists ."
4358,whoa that is a strict rule . do you know bing crops ? he sounds very popular in the land 1940 's !
4359,i do know him . jupiter has radio storms that are so strong that they can be picked up on am radio . that would be neat to hear i think .
4360,yes i would like to hear that one time . one of the most popular radio acts of the 1930s thirties was a ventriloquist .
4361,"i did n't know that . ho interesting ! soldiers in ww2 made simple radios using a razorblade and pencil as the diode , dubbing these foxhole radios !"
4362,very innovative indeed . bill murray voiced the human torch in the 1970s fantastic four radio show .
4363,i did n't know that ! how interesting !
4364,yes is n't it ? remember that song mmmbop by hanson ? they were once the most requested track on an alt rocky chicago station becaue the dj did n't say the title of the artist !
4365,hahah that 's awesome ! i 'm going to have mmmbop in my head now the rest of the night .
4366,haha sorry about that but it is a catchy song ! sometimes i forget to turn the radio down when i am on the phone . dolphins can even communicate over telephone !
4367,there is a website where you can listen to thousands of classic radio dramas for free ! i wish i knew teh name of it .
4368,yes i would consider checking that out . do you think it books on the iphone ? i love my iphone and it 's hard to think back on the old dial phone . it was invented by an undertaker !
4369,i did n't know that ! i remember the old rotary phones fro when i was a kid . i ca n't believe how far phones have come since then .
4370,"yes it truly is amazing . apparently a 1930 's actress hedy lamarr helped to invent the cellphone , wifi , a nd gps !"
4371,i had no idea ! an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent !
4372,whoa that is al ot of power in our pocket ! did you know there is no correlation between cell phone connectivity quality andc ' bars ' of service .
4373,i had no idea ! new york 's area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone ! i had a good tiem chatting with you !
4374,"interesting . must not matter much anymore . there is even a luxury phone maker that hires the london symphony to record exclusive ringtones . great chatting with you too , goodnight !"
4375,that is neat ! have a food night too !
4376,"hello , do you like football ?"
4377,i do like football ? o you ? i 've heard that it 's been a category on jeopardy before !
4378,"i do , but i do n't follow it very much , ans i heard about that jeopardy show and the nfl based knowledge e , i woudl never pass that one haha !"
4379,it coudl be hard . i 'm not sure i could get ones where they ask about specific pay s .
4380,"right ? i would n't either . i guess during that episode alex tribe was considered th entertainment on that show hahaa , there were some pretty funny answers ."
4381,"he is pretty good . i mean , aaron rodgers considers him the greatest of all time of game show hosts ."
4382,he is ! i like him a lot . i think h knows everything avoid the snl football after boeing the host for so many years ! fooball seems so slow ! an entire game only has about 11 minutes of actual live play !
4383,wow ! that must mean a lot of commercials and penalties ho on during a game ! football has been around a long time though . the first playoff was in 1932 .
4384,"wo w , that is a long time ! but football is loved by many ! 8 did n't know that football players do n't really make as much money as you would think , an engineer makes more in a lifetime than an nfl player !"
4385,i guess that means that matt patricia likes the game then more than money considering he was an aeronautical engineer before becoming a coach .
4386,waht ? that 's amazing ! he must love the game a lot ! even uk in the 60 's pro bowlers made more than top football players ! twice as much . . . .
4387,that i so bizarre to think that bowlers make more than football players ! especially with the superbowl coming p on the firs sunday in february !
4388,"i know , it blows my mind ! the game has been a favorite of sports fans forever . the superbowl is the best , i do watch that ford sure ! those players are liken animals on the field when it comes to the superbowl !"
4389,"i have to admit i do like watching the best of the nfc and afc compete against each other ! speaking of animal s , did you know there is al lawyer in switzerland that represents them in court ?"
4390,represents animal ? i guess since there are 20 quintillion animals out there this lawyer has his work cut out for him !
4391,i bet he does at that ! i wonder if he would nee da translator fo rom . some animals from distant areas speak different dialects or languages ; .
4392,"true , lol . . . . i guess some animals are protected already like hte loch ness wonder . i guess germany was the 1st o dive animals guaranteed legal rights . they is so interesting !"
4393,that is interesting ! have you heard about the netherlands building natural bridges for wildlife so they wo n't get hit by car son the roads ?
4394,"no ! wow , that 's awesome ! very smart and kind of them . i love animals more than a lo of people lol !"
4395,it is a great thing they did ! i wish the u . s . would do that !
4396,"i do too , w e have so many animals going exdticnt it would probably help a lot . they deserve tron thrive and be safe too ."
4397,they do need . i like cat they have their own scientific kingdom called animalia .
4398,haha did you watch the jeopardy episode with the nfl category ? it was on recently
4399,"9 did not , it must have even funny though , waht happend during it ?"
4400,apparently they were reading a lot of clues but no one on he panel even buzzer in because they had no idea what the answers were ol
4401,"i bet not , it 's a pretty niche subject to know all that knowledge . they 've got morse important things to learn lol . that does suck about alex tribe though ."
4402,"yes i agree behind iagnosis was sad . speaking of the nfl , do you watch the games a lot ? i dont , y watch important games like the superbowl myself"
4403,"for sur e , hope he an have a peaceful rest of his life . i watch a few , there 's only 11 minutes a game of actual play , i wonder how they calculated that stat ."
4404,"yeah game seem for much longer than that , it most be the commercials though . what do you thin about the fact that engineers make more in their lifetime than the average nfl ot mlb player ?"
4405,"that 's pretty crazy , i could see that though . it 's the long game or the engineers , it 's a lot more state of a job ."
4406,"haha yes i think you 're right . but i do n't like them it 's how the saints treat heir cheerleaders , i think that a cheerleader should not have to leave teh restaurant if a player is already there , that seems very sexist"
4407,"for sure , people should be able to go eat wher they want , i do n't like how they can tell the chedreladers what to do or what not to do . you a big animal person n ?"
4408,yes i love dogs ! and its crazy to me tha there are a total of 20 quintillion animals on earth but do sure most are bugs haha
4409,"for sure , taht 's a ton of organisms . i love dogs too , they are so awesome . do you have a dog ?"
4410,"yes we have ah husky actually and she 's super awesome ! it 's crazy tha germany is the first country o give animals constitutional rights , i wonder what those are"
4411,"that 's awesome , il love husky 's ! a male should definitely ahve rights , my dog is awesome too ! he 's an australian shepard terrier mix , i have him ."
4412,"that 's real what 's hi some ! what 's interesting to me is that animals will apparently develop a white patch on their forehead if they are domesticated , i wonder why"
4413,"his name eis rogue , wat about yours ? that 's interesting about the white patch , i 'd be curious to dig deeper into that !"
4414,yesh er neck is terra ! and she 's very cute haha . what do you think about the fact that hiccups are actually made evolutionary thing that are relics of when land animals had lungs and gills ?
4415,"that 's interesting , the evolutionary things are so cool , i get the hiccups a lot too ."
4416,haha i think i have the right now . i 'm just glad though that scotland passed a lot to protect the loch ness monster back in 1912 just in case it exists lol
4417,"that 's funny , i 'd definitely be a lawyer in switzerland to represent the animals , love them !"
4418,"yep animal , s ar awsome ! it 's so funny to that they can be million of a meter to multiple enters long l , ol i love animal sofa ll shapes and sizes"

4424,i can . they do so much standing around and waiting . it feels like they try to run dont he check . i wouldnt buy a ticket . too expensive .
4425,"it really is ! maybe that 's why they get paid the big bucks these days , until even the 60s ."
4426,"the 60s were not a great time for players . i dont think they hd a union , and the league revneuew as pretty low ."
4427,"i agree , even bowlers made double what the made !"
4428,the bowlers were living in a golden age . even regain will they see that kind of money and attention . lol
4429,i agree ! they are lucky to make it on espn 12 lol . do you think there will ever be a woman that tries out for a team ?
4430,i in ' ? t know enough abou women 's bodies to say . there ar n't many womans who play in high school or college though .
4431,"i agree , but there is a small chance someday ! did you know espn won an emmy or the yellow first down line ?"
4432,i heard that . i guess they were the first to create superimposed graphics . now they are everywhere .
4433,i agree taht is crazy ! i thin they university of iowa should get one for their pink locker rooms !
4434,"yeah , the pink locker room . does that trick even work ? i wonder . if it did , everyone would dp it ."
4435,"i doubt it , because the hawkeyes do n't do so well at home haha ."

4444,did you know taht the nfl does not have any rules about whuch gender can participate in the game ?
4445,yea the think that would be so cool if af female player made a pro roster .
4446,"yeah that would . i hear that they do not make that much money though , except for the popular players of course"
4447,yeah i guess bowlers back 's the 60
4448,"strange fact , new orleans cheerleaders are not allowed to fine in the the restaurant as the nfl players"
4449,"that is strange , you figure rules ike tthat are phase but by now , b u ti guessin ot ."
4450,"yah , go figure . and they were to really need to know a lot about heir players considering thay user tracking chips inside their shoulder pad s ."
4451,yeah i think they put them in helmets for measuring impact of hit so make things safer as well .
4452,"veep interesting with all this technology nowadays . how about other types f football , like soccer , do you watch it at all ?"
4453,"neat that is probably my favorite , but i only really follow the english and european leagues . how about you ?"

4465,no i did n't . o you happen to know the reason why ?

4467,ha ha ! ! ! thank use do you follow soccer at all these days ?
4468,"o , i do n't follow soccer . do you ?"
4469,yes i do and in fact i recently read somewhere tht d . c . united have a stadium called audio field and according to their officials it will welcome more than just mls matches .
4470,i do know that soccer is them not popular game in the world . what makes it so exciting ?
4471,it is a game that has been around for a very long tim e in is played from what i heard by 250 million players in over 200 countries in the world .
4472,do you have a favorite team ?
4473,"i do . i 'm a big liverpool fan but also like juventus , barcelona and the new england revolution ."
4474,arent hey all in the same league ?
4475,no the teams hat i mentioned are in different leagues and in different countries .
4476,with all those different leagues how do they determine who are the world champions ?
4477,search country has a league and from there it gets determined by their position in the ranking of they makings tot he champions league in europe or not .
4478,so the champions league determines the overall champion ?
4479,correct and that is just in europe ! ! ! here in the u sit works differently . i heard somewhere that soccer players run on average 7 miles per mate .
4480,"that 's a lot , and i know there 's a lot of real action , whereas footbal ; l only has 11 minutes of live action in a game ."
4481,wow ! ! ! i did n't know this . i also recently read tht these upper bowl is smaller than soccer 's 3rd biggest event .

4487,"not realy , i prefer soccer but football is an interesting gamer s well , interesting fact but in the 60s top bowlers made more money thin football players ."
4488,that is pretty crazy considering that he football players are more prone to injuries all i guess it was good to be a bowler back then q
4489,"i agree an theres also all that brain damage , i think its a risk sport but now i will earn a lot of money fo doing so ."
4490,yeah fooball players do make a ridiculous amount of money !
4491,"i agree especially players like benjarvus green ellis , the guy never fumbled the ball in his entire carreer , that is an awesome stat to hold ."
4492,"that is really impressive ! i wonder why that guy isnt more known lol there is a rocket scientist that was a footbal coach , matt patricia ."
4493,"wow i bet he was a pretty good coach , expensive to hire as we , l ."
4494,yeah . i bet it was worth it though !
4495,"yeah i agree , so do you also like soccer ? its a sport that moves a lt of money"
4496,"i have watched soccer on occassions , but i do not keep up with it . do like soccer ?"

4498,wow that is amazin g !
4499,"yeah he has a big heart for sure , not many players would do that even dough tasty make a lot of money , interesting fact but soccer makes more money than almost every other sport combined"
4500,"wow that is awesome ! good they are making good money , seems like they get injured a lot als ."
4501,"yeah in soccer injuries are quite common , there are over 750 illion players so imagine how many broken legs that figure represents ."
4502,"dierks , id rather not thanks lol i hear soccer players run an average of 7 miles per game !"
4503,"that is a long distance of , 7 miles per game , it must be really exhausting ."
4504,i recently learned that greenland cant jim fifa because there 's not enough grass there lol ca n't they usd fake grass ?
4505,"i agree lol , it all the tech they could definetly install a soccer court with fake grass , . so , e pro teams have them ,"
4506,do you watch football ?
4507,yes i did snoop dogg wrote a song for his son 's football team or
4508,wow nice . bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s

4531,"though i 'm glad the playoffs are here , i ? m sad the season is coming to an end ."
4532,it will make sundays a little more boring without football to watch .
4533,"i hope to see a woman player in the nfl soon , maybe as a kicker at least ."
4534,that would be interesting .
4535,i just hate the fact the actual live gameplay is so short .
4536,itd o too . it i actually ridiculous that if is only 11 minutes . there are too many commercials .
4537,"with as many commercials , you would think the players would ne paid better than engineers ."
4538,"most peopel think hat they are paid these huge salaries , so they wo n't have to worry about their future , but most can not play for too long g , so is an engineer can make more money ."
4539,maybe the endorsements help to make up the gap for some o 'the more recognizable players .
4540,most likely . they probably make more over their lifetimes in endorsements tha just from salary alone .
4541,did you know the saints cheerleaders have to leave the restaurant if players come in
4542,i just learned that . i do n't get that . that is the dumbest thing in the world . i have no idea what the reason for that is . maybe th football players should n't be permitted to eat at the restaurant if the cheerleaders were there first .
4543,makes the league and team look hypocritical of women
4544,"absolutely . that about degrading as well . but they also se tracking chips im shoulder pads to record every player move on a field , so ther league has some issues ."
4545,i wonder what kind of stats are collected and they are used
4546,i coul ; d n't imagine . they can just rewatch games to see what had happened . they do n't need chips . very creepy .
4547,go patriots !
4548,"hi , how are you this morning ?"
4549,"great ! hope you 're doing well ! do do you follow association football aka soccer ? hard to believe it makes more money than golf , tennis , football , basketbal l , baseball and hockey combined !"
4550,i watch a little soccer . i did n't realize it made so much money .
4551,"i'ts crazy , is n't it ? i guess they 's why mesut ozil donated his entire old cup victory bonus to pay for the surgery of 23 children in brazil . must have been pocket change considering !"
4552,"i guess if you take into consideration it 's played by 250 million people worldwide erin over 200 countries , it is alot of money . that was fun a great act that beat did for those kids . kudos to him ."
4553,agreed ! hopefully others follow in his footsteps . so so you1 hollow regular football aka gridiron ball like the nfl ? i do and always wondered why there are no measles when the nfl has no rule against them joining as long as they meet the requirements !
4554,"i watch a little footbal . . ive wondered myself about tone females , as well ."
4555,"i mean , there 's only 11 minutes of live game play anyway . so you 'd think at least ton or two would have been drafted by picked up by a team , right ?"
4556,"true , that 's alot of standing round time dont he sidelines , for sure . you would think at least a kicker would be a female ."
4557,"agreed . maybe they 'd rather enter engineering since engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl or mlb player . it 'd be a much wiser decision , i suppose !"
4558,that 's so true . i find it interesting that the top bowlers in the 1960s made twice as much as the top football stars . that ' sold .
4559,"no kidding ! what ' seven wilder , or sadder actually , is knowing saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as saints player sand in one walks in after r , they have to leave . that is it wrong !"
4560,i know . i 'd like to know the incident that prompted that rule . i bet it 's very juicy .
4561,"exaclty . i wonde what happened d ! still that could classify as discrimination in this day and ate , i suppose . but is that truly as bad as georgia tech once beating a team 2220 ? h ! tbh highest score ever in the game of football !"
4562,"hear , i think that was was played way back in 1916 , nowadays that just des n't happen , anymore . look at the recent superbowl , lowest scoring superbowl game ever ."
4563,"so tune ! b ut when you have player sin the league liek benjarvus greenellis never fumbling the ball , i can see why !"
4564,that 's a pretty awesome feat for hum to accomplish . imagine the pressure of never fumbling the ball . it would . too much for me .
4565,"same here . i 'd probably fumble as soon as it 's handed to me . ha ! wonder what his mindset would be if he was forced to visit the visitor 's lockerroom at iowa before a game , where the message pink ? talk about demeaning ! that 's crazy !"
4566,"an all pink locker room would b every intimidating for any visiting team , for sure , getting back to soccer , i was shocked to learn that jon stewart was a skilled soccer player ."
4567,"wow ! that is shocking ! i tell you what surprised me was learning there is actually a soccer variation where 3 teams face each other at the exact same time ! it 's like , how does that happen ?"
4568,"that 's pretty wild , i 'd like to watch a game of that being played . well , it 's ben nice chatting with you his morning . i needed to get to work , i 'll talk to you later , friend ."
4569,hi . do you like sports ?
4570,"hi , i do like football as in nfl football , although i am a fan of association football as well ."
4571,me too . i like the nfl but i do also watch other leagues of football as well on occasion . did you hear that winston churchill high is doin very well ?
4572,"is that high school football ? ca n't say i have watched that , at least not since i was in high school . sometimes i watch canadian football which is a little different he nfl ."
4573,what is high school football and winston churchill high hire da former nfl corner back to lead the football team there .
4574,oh right . now that you mention it i think i did see something about this on espn . wil ; ie williams is running the team right ?
4575,stat is correct . they also hire chris samuel and joe played offensive tackle for the redskins .
4576,it 's interesting the guys ant to coach high school football after being pros . you 'd think they would haven made more then enough money in the nfl to set then for life .
4577,i thin that they did it o give back to teh community because that did make them new in the nfl and this is a way for the them to give back .
4578,"that 's probably right . then again maybe playing in hte nfl does n't set you for life . association football players , s soccer , make more money ."
4579,way back in the 60s the best football players made less than the top bowlers at that time .
4580,that 's crazy . i wonder if back then there was more action in nfl games ? do n't get me wrong i enjoy it but the average game has just 11 minutes of actual game play .
4581,that was insane indeed . i did n't know that but going back to your previous in soccer players make more money than any othe report out here .
4582,since they make more money then con be cord generous jesuit ozil donated his 300 000 euro world cup bonus to pay for children 's surgeries . i 've never heard of ann fl player donating hoss upper bowl bonus .
4583,neither do i . that was a very generous donation by mesut ozil and he is a fantastic soccer player is he german ?
4584,yes . the surgeries for for children in brazil . the host country of that world cup . such a nice story .
4585,this is truly inspiring .
4586,"it 's funny that we even call association football soccer he . did you , now ' soccer ' is a slang term ? that 's how it originally caught on ."
4587,i did n't know that soccer is slang term and its kind of weird that is called association football here .
4588,almost as weird as 3 team soccer have you see that before ? all 3 teams play at once !
4589,that is crazy . i 'm not sure what the actual rules for this type of game are .
4590,i only saw it on an it was really ahead to fellow . anyways i 've got to get going .
4591,me too . thanks for chatting with me today . have a nice day .
4592,bye
4593,bye
4594,hey are you going o watch th xfl ? and have you ever been to audi field
4595,i do plan on watching the xfl ! i think it will be interesting to see how the xfl and dc united shar bethel southwest dc facility in 2020 considering ho football will take a harder toll on the grass there . what about you .
4596,yeah i 'm looking forward to the sun actually . i also miss the days before football stadiums were named after corporate sponsor slow like audi field
4597,"so true ! ha ! are you also a fan of the , , ? to third ay , i 'm surprised no female players have been signed considering there are n rules against women playing as long as they meet the eligibility requirements ."
4598,"i think we 'll see a female nfl player someday , i just wish they woul fix the issue with openly having 11 minutes of live gameplay per game , that seem to boring goto me"
4599,"so true . i mean , if they can create chips that tracks players movements and ball location or speed or velocity or station , they can extent the live gameplay time . it 's ridiculous , is n't it ?"
4600,"that is ridiculous , i 'm not sure why they woul want to kno the rotation of the ball , bu ti can understand why theyd ant to kno wa player 's spree damned location"
4601,"you 're right . but then again , e engineers the more than the average lifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players so maybe it 's easier engineers to create these chips than it is for nfl officials to adjust the gameplay time ."
4602,"yeah that is shocking . because you think they would make so much money . do you ever watch soccer by the way , also known s association football"
4603,"i do , actually . what bout you ? i still a n't believe it makes me money than the six other major sports combined !"
4604,"yeah i never watch it i think it 's really boring , but it is shocking that it makes more than even american football , have you ever seen the variation where three soccer team are playing all at once"
4605,no but i bt it 's wild to see . ha ! wonder if players are allowed to touch th ball with their hands and arms while it 's in all unlike regular soccer ?
4606,"yea i do n't know it sound more interesting to me than regular soccer though lol , have you heard of the german player mesut ozil ?"
4607,i admire him because he donated his entire world cup bonus to pay or the surgeries of 23 different kids over in brazil . i wish all the ; ets were like him !
4608,"yes thats rounds awsome , he donated over 300 , 000 euros to do that too and eh did n't even have to , what a nice guy"
4609,"agreed . o na similar soccer note , did you know john stewart was a great soccer player in college . he also represented the us in brazil at the pan american maccabi games back in 83 !"
4610,"thay 's very impressive ! i never knew tha the played , what do you think about regular football aka american football"
4611,"i do enjoy football in general . in fact , benjarvus greenellis was one of my favorite players because he never fumbled the football in his entire pro career r , which is amazing !"
4612,i agree it is amazing ! they shout ; d pay him a lot od money ! what do you think about espn winning an emmy for creating the yellow line thats hows during tv broadcasts of football games
4613,"they truly deserved it . the yellow line is so innovative ad i do n't think i can watch a game without it . we talked about engineers getting paid more earlier , but can you believe the top bowlers , the more than the top footbal players back in the 60s ? that 's so sad and disappointing considering how rough football is compared to how easy bowling is ."
4614,yes i think bowling is much easier than becoming a professional football player lol . what do you think about university of iowa painting their locker rooms completely pink
4615,"hi , do you watch football"
4616,"bet , i watch football sometimes but i 'm more of a basketbal fan . how about you ?"
4617,"i also watch basketball , and it is old of my favorite sports ."
4618,im actually watching the lakers vs warriors tight now
4619,me too . hopefully nothing wrongs with lebron
4620,im not a lebron far n ! ! ! im hoping something is a little wrong with him haha
4621,"whatever , . btw , do you watch football games this season"
4622,"no havent watched any , i you knows soccer makes more money than football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis adn hockey combined . ?"
4623,i rhino it makes sense to me because soccer is the most popular sport i the world .
4624,im not a soccer fan so im not to sure what they make
4625,i think soccer players make less money than a basketball player . but as a whole soccer isp patched by a lot of people more in comparison to basketball . that is just my opinion
4626,yea basketball players are making upwards of 50m illion a year thats crazy . i know overseas soccer is a huge sport . in there exists a variation of soccer where 3 teams face each other at the same time .
4627,i never heard of such thing . how 3 teams can play on the field a they same time is a mind blowing . hahhaa
4628,im sure that would cause a lot of confusion on the field !
4629,bot to the players adn the viewer so did you know that jon stewart was a skilled soccer player in college an din for he us in the pan american maccabi games ?
4630,"i had no idea , im ah used jon stewart fan , s speaking f football in the 1960s op bowlers made twice as much as top football ; k stars"
4631,i am very surprised that a top bowler made more than a top football player . what happened to the sport of bowling ? bowling popularity has drastically decreased
4632,"i love bowling , i play lol the time . tried taking my little brother hes aid it was ' boring ' and that ' fortnite ' was more fun ."
4633,"i agree with your brother there . but we have different hobbies and interests , right ?"
4634,"agreed , as long as everyone tries different things with an open mind hen thats all we can ask for"
4635,"your warrior hill go down today , hahaha . to , nice chattin with you . enjoy the game"
4636,tank yo . we will come back stronger !
4637,"i have a friend who disc considering engineering , and i should tell her that she ' l make more in real lifetime than the average nfl or mlb player"
4638,"it is true , sometimes it really does pay to eb smart"
4639,"of course , if she worked hard enough to meet the eligibility requirements , she could technically join the nfl"
4640,"ive never heard of a female player in teh nfl , but plenty who play ' association football ' or soccer as most people say it ."
4641,soccer was actually a slang term that americans the . but it 's slang for the official ham
4642,"it is a wildly popular sport . the super bowl , is smaller than soccer 's third biggest event ."
4643,taht 's not surprising considering over 200 countries play she sport
4644,the only country that definitely cant join is greenland . not enough grass grows there for a soccer field .
4645,"even without their ijvovlmeent , soccer still makes more money than the other popular sports combined"
4646,"it does , and it has some major activists too . here was an ivory coast player who single handedly stopped a civil war ."
4647,that 's impressive . a german player paid for surgeries for children in brazil using his world cup victory bonus
4648,so many players have contributed so positively to society . that is one thing i really like about the super community .
4649,jon stewart was part of that community during his college days and played at the pan american maccabi games
4650,"i didnt know that . thats pretty cool . , snoop dog actually wrote his son 's high school fight song"
4651,i wonder if they still use that every year . it still does n't get used as much as the superimposed yellow first down line taht espn created for american football . they even have an emmy for that invention
4652,"i know , that is an important one . my mother was surprised it wasnt there when she watched my brother play live in high school ."
4653,it definitely helps in keeping track of hte game . i wonder who the to keep track of the score there georgia beam cumberland ink 1916 . 220 points is a lot !
4654,"wow , how bad must one team be to not score , and get that many points scored on seem . i wonder how many turnovers there were in that game ."
4655,soo any ! it 's still the highest score to occur in a football game
4656,14 of the 25 largest stadiums belong to college football teams .
4657,i wonder if players from those teams who get drafted to the nfl are used to the atmosphere of large stadiums
4658,"hi , do you like soccer ?"
4659,i think i know a bit more about american football . i know in tech nfl there are 32 teams that make up the league .
4660,that is true . do you have a favorite team ?
4661,i do . i am a packers fan . a lot of football players have done really great though ! did you know that and average nfl game only has 11 minutes o five gameplay ?
4662,i heard there is not a rule against women playing footbal or seems accurate . . . by the way i 'm a bears fan !
4663,"oh , that 's funny ! hard to believe the average lifetime salary of an engineer is more than an average nfl player ."
4664,agreed . the saints cheerleaders have to leave any restaurant a player walks into . seems sexist .
4665,seems sexist to me ! ! did you know the nfl uses tracking devices ?
4666,what kind of tracking devices ?
4667,they use chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field .
4668,"i like to embed hips in my belly , especially doritos ! soccer remakes more han football though so i will push my kids that way ."
4669,i did not know that soccer players make more ! i know americans call it soccer because it is slang for association football .
4670,have you ever seen th exam with 3 teams playing ? i have n't but ponder hoe taht would work .
4671,which sport are we talking abou t football or soccer ?
4672,"since r , sorry ! would it be on a triangle field ?"
4673,i seriously wonder ? ! did you know former nfl'er benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the football ; l in his career ?
4674,that 's impressive since he played for 2 teams over 6 years . and one was the patriots ! he would have been bench if he did fumble !
4675,"i would say so . har it believe , but the top bowlers in the 1960 's made 2x as much as top fb stars ."
4676,"the highest score in a football game happened in 1916 , 222 0 ! ! ! !"
4677,wow ! that is a big score ! who were the team ?
4678,georgia tech and cumberland ! nice chatting with you !
4679,how 's it going ? did you know footbal list a family of sports involving kicking a ball to score ?
4680,"yes , and here are many types of football across te world !"
4681,"yea , there 's even canadian and australian rules football !"
4682,"and dont forget soccer , which is also known as association football ."
4683,"yea , football is also pretty popular colleges port , in 1916 georgia tech won a game scoring 222 points !"
4684,that seems a bit much . they probably should not have run the score of taht high .
4685,maybe georgia tech really dislike cumberland
4686,maybe . espn won an emmy fo 'the yellow 1st down line on football games . it is hard to imagine watching a game now without that line
4687,"yea , th superb , posed yellow firstdown market is a godsend"
4688,i sometimes forget the players themselves cant actually see the line when they are playing
4689,it 's pretty crazy how many injuries football has when there is only an average of 11 min of live gameplay
4690,"yes , well players are getting stronger and faster all the time , with that comes injuries s ."
4691,"ye a , must be one of the reasons why the nfl embed tracking chips into the players ' equipment"
4692,"well k a 17 eek regular season , plus lenght playoffs can lead to a lot of injuries due to wear and tear"
4693,"yea , the game is so grueling i wonder if there wil lever be a female player despite being bo rules banning it"
4694,"as long as she meet 'the requirement s , it is possible"
4695,i suppose so but there still needs some changes to be made like having the saints get rid of the rules requiring cheerleaders not to b erin tie same places as the players
4696,"yeah , they gave to leave the table if players show up at the restaurant . i guess they do not want any handy party with the players"
4697,"the sapiens rule sound antiquated and sexist to me , they 're all adults"
4698,"ia agree , i just think they might want to avoid any tesla problems so htey are being novelty cautious ."
4699,"well i have to go , nice chatting with yiu"
4700,do you like soccer ?
4701,yes i di . do yu know how many people in the world play it or .
4702,yes around 250 million of u sin 200 countries

4706,wow amazing . even jon steward used to be a soccer player
4707,"nice a tv costa fan a soccer player , lots of talent there"
4708,yes he represented the us in the panamerican games in brazil
4709,wow cool . did you know that superbowl is very small compared to soccer events ?
4710,"wow , i guess since so many people around the works like the sport"
4711,yeah true . did you know greenland can not join fifa ?
4712,"really , why is that ?"
4713,because get do not ahve enough grass for a soccer field . did you know snoop rog wrote a song for his son 's team ?
4714,wow . do you like the nfl ?
4715,i sure do . did you know snoop fog groot epa son for his son 's team ?
4716,cool . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
4717,i wonde in it is supposed to have some impact on the other team
4718,i one too . dogs you know espn won an emmy once ?
4719,did not know that . waht did they win it for ?
4720,the superimposed yellow line . it was nice chatting with you .
4721,"well there , are you a big fan o football ?"
4722,"no , especially high school football . i find really boating . you ?"
4723,"yeah i follow the nfl just a bit , but only my local team i would say ."
4724,i have to agree with the parents who do n't want the children to play because of health concerns
4725,yeah i would n't want my kids to play football . id you see the movie concussion ? ;
4726,the will smith movie ? yes i thought if was goo ? have you ever heard of this coach willie williams ? greats lame
4727,"yeah that one , i think if people watch it , they have second thoughts about how damaging h sports can be . and no , i haven ' 5 heard of him but i agree he ta name ."
4728,i agree about the movie . i expect there will be a lot od canoes in teh coming years . i get a kick ou the the fact hat in the 60 's bowlers made twice as much a footbal stars . how things have changed !
4729,"yeah that is a wild fact , i guess the things to do was to be a bowler in the 60 's , that was the life !"
4730,"sure would be a lot easier physically than football . did you see espn won an emmy for creating thats rupert , posed yellow line representing the first down ? i wonder what year tat was"
4731,yeah i am trying to thin kind i can remember watching games before it happened . i know i ahve fun it 's just so part of the game now i ca n't really remember .
4732,"i 'm sure it was innovative adn useful , but winning an emmy for that seems a bit much ."
4733,an it does but 9 do n't know too much about all the categories . do you now what hte highest score game of football ever was ?
4734,"in 1916 , 2220 . that must have been one boring game . i woulda assume the rules were a bit different in 1916"
4735,"yeah good call . i agree , it sounds like there woudl be a touchdown on every play . hte defense must have just so there ."
4736,did you see that an average nfl game only has 11 minute for live gameplay ? this would be part of why i find it boring i think .
4737,"yeah do ca n't fell as much on tv , but i know when you go to games and watch live , there are so many areas and stoppage"
4738,i had no idea the nfl uses tracking chips on is players to record every move on the field . very high tech
4739,"yeah it in they use tracking stuff a lot more . i now they have in helmets as well , hopefully tracking hits to the head ."
4740,hopefully . the last line on my article says there is a variation of soccer where 3 teams face each other at the same time . that might actually be fun to watch !
4741,"that would be pretty wild lol sure . well it was nice talking with you today , u hope you have a good day ."
4742,"hello ! i have today we call ahve q good discussion about football and religion , and how in some cases they have merge d ."
4743,i think brady is looking for a away to stay relevant and this spirituality through football is a bit ridiculous .
4744,"honestly , same . when daniel won said ' sports might bring people together better than religion ' i honestly stuffed at how absurd that statement is ."
4745,if anything i think that the idea of sports tends to make people more divisive . it is crazy how bitter and competitive people yet about teams .
4746,"same , if i would agree with anyone from these articles i would agree with bob ryan because he 's skeptical about is as he should be !"
4747,i wonder if people would eb as apt to follow brady if he was ; losing more taht eh was winning .
4748,"i doubt it , which is funny seeing as when it 's about religion , people will follow through almost anything ."
4749,i wonder if he is getting it up to have some sort of cult or mgm stuff once eh is finally too old play anymore .
4750,"to be honest that would be pretty coo , . i enjoy leaning abou cult , they 're interesting . i was surprised when i read the nfl ha snow rule against female players !"
4751,that sure i suprising considering how male dominated he sport is .
4752,"honestly , yea . did you see about girls being allowed into boy scout s ? gets me pretty riled up lo ? did you see that it used to be required to read from a bible in the u . s ?"
4753,i kno that it was commonly used as reading curriculum . it was an easily accessible book and quit to challenging read .
4754,"i wins they still had classes in high school at least ! not forced , but optional . . did you read that iowa 's locker room for visiting football team is completely pink ? ? ? that cracked me up ."
4755,that does seem like something iowa would do . they are quite into blazzing outer players from opposite teams .
4756,really ? i do n't know much about them honestly . . . that do you know ?
4757,there is a huge rivalry between the two teams fro the main iowa colleges . either you are a hawkeye fan or an un of i fan . they are as bad as packers and vikings fans
4758,ahh . . . it 's like that town here in alabama ! ? did you see the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
4759,the rest of the time must be spent on huddle nad waiting for the snap . i wonder if other forms of football ave more action time .
4760,"yeah , that seems kinda silly to me to waste all that time . ."
4761,it really does . i wonder if there was more tie to the cumberland game where they set the high score record .
4762,what was that all about ? the cumberland game ?
4763,cumberland completely shopped georgia back at the beginning of the century . it was 2220 . i mean at some point you just one to give up .
4764,d a n g that 's crazy . well thanks for the great conversation !
4765,yes it was a nice hat .
4766,to you like football and avocado ice cream ? well not together or in that order but avocado ice cream is a good with almonds . it 's also of bradys things . he is amazing .
4767,"ah . the renowned tom brady . did you know that to tom brady , footbal las become a religion ? i was very fascinated by that !"
4768,"the truly is amazing , yes , i heard something about that . he has become mores spiritual nad even has some best selling book called ' athletes bible ' he is on a spiritual quest ."
4769,"well if he looks to football as a religion , i am not very surprised . according goto chris renee , fooball fans also have a nearreligious devotion to the sport . i guess it is not just tom brady ."
4770,thats interesting ! im actually goint o check out the series to vs time he is interested in finding the why 's of life .
4771,"speaking of football , i recently earned that the locker room for visiting football team in the university of iowa is painted pink . imagine that !"
4772,tha hilarious to see the visiting teams race when the see that locker room at !
4773,"i agree , it must be demoralizing to walk into a room painted pink !"
4774,"i stink everyone should wear no ! but i can see from a ' macho ' stand point thinking one is ' offensive ' it mostly as a joke , speaking of schools georgia tech had the highest score recorded ever 2220 when they defeated cumberland"
4775,we can not talk about football without mentioning the nfl . dd you know that average fl game has only 11 minutes od live gameplay ? only 11 minutes of the broadcast is actual running around !
4776,"i couldnt ' believe it wen i found out about that , had no idea and how about that superimposed yellow line ? someone won an emmy for that !"
4777,that 's fascinating ! the lifetime earnings of engineers are higher than nfl players . it 9s probably becase nfl players can only play football for so my years .
4778,thats true ! although football in other countries is known as soccer which soccer pays swam ore than mlb and nfl and there are so many variations of football which as known as football codes
4779,"yes , in australia 's version of football is rugby football . all of these variations of football is confusing me ."
4780,"met , ! also makes sense football players dont make as much since a regular season is 1 weeks running from september to december . i should know by now since my father and la adn husband are nuts over it"
4781,"continuing off your point , top bowlers in the 1960s made twice as much as football star s ! and i thought that professional athletes made a lot ."
4782,i know ! thats crazy to think about . i wonder how much brady makes especially since he has won 6 superbowls ! he is known as a messier figure for a lot of patriot fans
4783,"and the you remember that engineers make more than tom brady in their lifetime , i and if this was half a century ago , a bowler would make twice as such as tom brady !"
4784,yes ! at least he doe n't have to worry about it since his mega super model gisele bundchen more than doubles his salary .
4785,hte nfl is probably teh most gender inclusive sport . they area allowed to play in the nfl if they meet the league 's skill requirements .
4786,"need , it would be cool to see other females play but honestly i would be scared for my little body with all those big though and run players . . . id be ha ; pay gift hey carry me places but not sandwich me in a way field . . . lol but awesome if one of us makes it out there i will sure eb cheering q fun chat ! good night !"
4787,"i agree , with all of the concussions gained from football it would be a challenge for a dfemael to play it professionally . good night to you too !"
4788,"agree , but will keep finger crossed . good night , so"
4789,"tom brady created a new lifestyle routine called the tbs method . basically it includes everythings from digesting ana personal training to encourage , meant and lifestyle marthas"
4790,"i here about that , it 's his book right ?"
4791,"yrs , basically tom brady is trying to start a new kind of spirituality based off of how he sees the game of football . heated o you think about it ?"
4792,"i think it 's great , whatever works for him to be the best h can be . i also heard he has q documentary series ."
4793,"yes , teh doctor series pretty much follows how he came up with this philosophy . it talks about his journey to self discovery"
4794,i watched the first two episodes taht came out january 25th . it focused on his physical and mental preparation . i thought it was very good .
4795,"oh ok . i have always wondered how much the physical preparation takes a toll on ones mental state over times , e specially for professional sports . do they al about that in the dc series ?"
4796,"yeah they do , it really gives you a different outlook on his life ."
4797,"thats cool . some people have said that belichick , the coach , does n't seem to have the same type of charisma and charm tha brady has , even though they may have the same spirit for the game do you greet with this statement ?"
4798,"i do agree with the statement . although he might not have the same charisma , f ans really do have faith in belichick . so much they have their own creed ' in bill we trust ' ."
4799,"i agree too , ultimately the coach can make or break a team . some have complained about the religious devotion to the patriots that fans often have , but i do n't think this is anything new . do you think the devotion is well balanced , or a little much in your opinion ?"
4800,i feel like it ' sport with the patriots just because of how much they have accomplished .
4801,"same , i dont really see the same kind of devotion for a lot of other texans out there in football , the isnt anything quite like it . i feel like its ok to be so devoted to ones team , especially since they are a very good team . i dont know how i feel about it being talked about in church , but to each thur own"
4802,"i do n't think so either , it feels a bit much . i agree 20th the mow retired columnist bob ryan , he flies like promoting good nutrition and fitness is fin , but do n't feel as if brady is a spiritual figure ."
4803,"i wonder if people see him as a spiritual leader becase of his real comeback at the super bowl , when the patriots were down 28 to 3 and he brought it back somehow . however , i dont think its really fair to credit just brady , seeing as it takes a whole team t do the sort of thing ."
4804,"same here , it does take a whole team ."
4805,"for example , the highest score in football was in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 ? . now thats team work !"
4806,absolutely ! either taht or hte other team was just really bad . maybe they intimidated them by gaining their locker room pink liek university of iowa did .
4807,"maybe . if use if they never had a fumble that could help too . rb benjarvus has never had a fumble in his entire career playing for the patriots , which seems almost impossible ."
4808,"wow , that does seem impossible . i wonder how much bowlers same in the 1960s ' , it was so ethan football players ."
4809,"yep , about twice as much . of course , we have to take into account the word football talks about so many other games other then just american footbal , such as soccer ."
4810,"oh yeah , i did n't think of that ."
4811,"yep , football is a game with a lot of meaning and history behind it ."
4812,hey would you read a book by to brady ? i want to read his new one the tbs method
4813,i find it unlikely . what is his new book about ?
4814,"its basically his strategy for how eh became successful , i think its worth a few d , ca n't believe hes 40 and is tied for teh superbowl record"
4815,that is pretty amazing . are you a fan off football ?
4816,"ya i think football is ok , i like the big games but do n't follow a team or anything , you ?"
4817,i am . i 'm a bears fan . were you aware that espn won an emmy for creating the yellow line that marks the first own position ? i ca n't imagine watching a game without that .
4818,"no that was a great invention ! definitely worth it , i also love how a team painted the other sides locker room pink , i wonder f their record improved after hat"
4819,i had heard bout hat . what a mind game . was that the university of iowa .
4820,"haha ya it was , i wonder if they have a player that has never fumbled teh ball like benjarvus greenellis"
4821,i was not aware that a player had never fumbled a ball . that 's amazing ! i do n't recognize the name . what team did he play for ?
4822,"y it was the patriots , he 's super good , did you know that bowling was super popular in the 60s ?"
4823,i di do . i remember it being more popular than it is now but i did not know that it was actually popular .
4824,"yup they even made twice as much as football players back then , thats nuts !"
4825,wow ! that would never happen now . did you know that there are no written rules against female playes in the nfl ; ?
4826,"no thats interesting , i think we coul dave a females kicker or something , i just the n't know if they could run quick enough , woman do hav flower muscle mass"
4827,i think kicker would be good . i think they could run fast brough . they would still have o pause requirements and with those men being so hue i do n't think they would be bale to play any other position .
4828,"ya if they cna pass the requirements then i dont see why problems , i jsut know that , fo instance , top women tennis players were beaten by high school students , that is why olympic games separate the men and womens divisions"
4829,i did not know that . did yiu know that there are tracking chips in players shoulder ponds and in the footballs in the nfl ?
4830,"ya i did know about that , t can that , all kinds of stats like speed , directing , acceleration and rotation , i hope the can use that information tp help prevent concussions"
4831,i hope so too . i wonder why they are not using that data to help make calls router thank bust relying on reviews ?
4832,"ya i agree , i think refs should be more impartial an douse the chip stop track that stuff , what do you think about the bible btw ?"
4833,i do n't haven ny real opinion one or another . i see good and bad in it .
4834,"do you like football ? i ? m not a huge tom brady fan , b ut apparently following him is like a religion for ome people l"
4835,it seems that way how . did you know e is a book author as wall now ?
4836,"yea h , and he calls it ' the athlete 's bible ' . i feel like taht 's offensive t the bible ."
4837,"it might just be . and he you hard about that documentary serie s , tom vs ti , ep ?"
4838,"yeah . it looks like he takes football really serious , so much so that it 's spiritual for him ."
4839,"seems that way , his religion he said . did you know women can play in then fl"
4840,"that 's pretty cool , but it 's a pretty sexist organization so i 'm not sure how enjoyable it would be to be in the league . if you 're a saints cheerleader , you have to leave the restaurant if a player comes into where you 're eating ."
4841,that rule is outdated and really needs to go now . so strange . did you hear they are using tracking chips on the players ?
4842,"yah , technology has grown in the game suite a but . espn won a emmy for that little yellow , first down line ."
4843,ye that is true and i am glad they made up with that line because it makes watching the game much easier
4844,definitely . van you believe thur former patriots running back never fumbled the football his entire career ?
4845,that is so amazing . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
4846,"yesh , it was 222 during a college game in 1916 ."
4847,yeah georgia tech really went all out on the game against cumberland .
4848,"yeah , just like iowa does for their guests ! thrid visiting team locker room is painted pink !"
4849,"i wonde why that is . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
4850,"only that it used to be required for students to read i school before 1963 , which is nuts to think about ."
4851,yes it is nad i am glad that is not he case anymore . it is still one of the most influential books in history though
4852,not influential enough for teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams ; neither of them used a bible for their swearing in .
4853,good point tc and also jefferson created his own version because he rid not like the supernatural stuff in it
4854,"that ; s silly to carved out there stuff about miracles and resurrection . . . it relates to hte story , ultimately . they must 've included lot for a reason n ."
4855,"hi there , do you watch the nfl ?"
4856,i sure do . o you have a favorite team or player ?
4857,i sure do . i love the patriot and tom i amazing . do you have one ?
4858,the guys is awesome nad now also a book ashton . did you hear abot that ?
4859,"oh yeah i heard he wrote that book the tbs method , the athlete 's bible but have not read it yet"
4860,he is everywhere to i want to read that book but i also was to watch the documentary tsoi
4861,"sa , e here . do you know heh as a favorite ice cream flavor ?"
4862,oh sure it is avocado and i am not surprised he eats very healthy lol the time
4863,yup pretty much . did you know women are allowed to play in the nfl ?
4864,that is pretty cool that there is no written rule against them and hope to see them in the field soon
4865,yeah i hope so too . did you know engineers make more int heir lifetime ?
4866,yeah and i wonder if that fact that they hav longer careers has anything to do with that
4867,that makes sense . the nfl is using tracking hip son the players now .
4868,yes they are and the are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others
4869,yeah . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
4870,"of course i do , he played effort he patriots and never fumbled the ball in his career"
4871,yup pretty much . do you know that highest score recorded in a college football game ?
4872,"yup that was quite something , 2220 with georgia tech beating cumberland"
4873,yeah exactly . did you know espn won nad emmy once ?
4874,it wa for the superimposed yellow line nad i think they deserve it
4875,yup . do you know much abut the bible ?
4876,i know what jefferson created his own version of it without the supernatural parts
4877,yeah he did and roosevelt and quincy did not us it to sweat in
4878,are you a fan of football ?
4879,"yes i am , are you , if you are what is your favorite team ?"
4880,i am a bears fan . ho about yourself ?
4881,"i am a pittsburgh steelers fans , the bears did pretty good for past season . ;"
4882,"yes they did . all came down to a stupid kick ha ha . anyway , did you know that in the 60 's top bowlers made more than top football players ?"
4883,"no i did n't know that , i always hear that most shots make more than fl , which i think t 's unfair ."
4884,i 'm positive it 's not the case now . do you know wat the highest score in a football game ever was ?
4885,"yes it was 2220 , i wonder what college they played or sounds more like ah is school football team ."
4886,it as georgia tech against cumberland . how is it even possible to score that many points in one game ?
4887,"it is possible , because i a soso a college football fan more than nfl and now a college team scores almost 80 pointes in a game if they are laying low rank team ."
4888,wow ! i only watch pro football so i was n't aware that that happened . speaking of college football did you hear what the university of iowa did to the visiting team 's locker room ?
4889,"yes , painted teh guest locker room pink , i guess they trying to say their opponents are girls ."
4890,i suppose so . what a strange thin do do . do you remember the rb benjarvus greenellis ?
4891,"i do n't remember him , but i read about he never fhmlbed the football in his nfl career ."
4892,that 's right . he played for the patriots . that 's a pretty impressive stat .
4893,"yes it was , i wonder why no one give the rams and credit during the superbowl , the did played well with an impressive record ."
4894,they had a very impressive season . i really thought they were going to go to the superbowl . did you also know that espn created the yellow line we see on tv that marks that first down ? can you imagine watching a game without that ?
4895,"no , i ca n't , but i wonder what they were using at the beginning do football , before espn came up the line ."
4896,fast 's a good question . it seems like it would have been difficult as a viewer regardless . have you heard that the average amount of live gameplay is 11 minutes ? !
4897,"i was thinking about that , i ca n't see ho with that possible , divide into four quarters ."
4898,me weighted . it seem impossible .
4899,hi . do you watch the nfl ?
4900,"i love the nfl . my team is the buffalo bills , so i 'm not much of a patriots fan . you ?"
4901,"i used t an and fan , but i live in a city they recent ; y abandoned so i 'm not into it at a anymore . i hate the patriots , anough"
4902,"that makes two of us . you ca n't argue with tom brady 's success , though . are you familiar ruth his tbs method ?"
4903,i hd never heard of it before . have you sen age documentary about it ?
4904,"i have n't , but id ' be curious to watch . as i understand it , try describes the method as his ' bible . '"
4905,"i agree it would be an interesting watch . i ate him , but i did whim credit forms till being good this late in his career be got ta be something to that method ."
4906,"yep , to be 04 years old and still winning is pretty impressive . its crazy the technology that 's available there days . did you know the put tracking chips in the players uniforms to keep track of them on the field ?"
4907,"yeah , that 's nuts . they are using i otto track the footballs too . i wonder what thet are going to do with the data ?"
4908,"i wonder if they 'll use it like the nfl is using gift , hte new league that lets you track the players movements via an app , . tha would be an interesting ew feature . kind of like when they added the yellow is down marker to the telecaster ."
4909,"yeah , that would be interesting , and world make the game more interactive for the fans . maybe that 'll help keep hem interested none there are only 11 minutes of action in a game"
4910,"it 's crazy to think of that , and compare it to another sport like soccer where theres ' ' action ' throughout the entire game . although i still much prefer football . hey never score enough in soccer . there 'd be no chance of anyone ever hitting 222 points in a soccer game , which is the record for most points in a football game , ."
4911,"yeah , soccer is constant but boring beyond belief lol . i ca n't imagine a score what whig be you 'd think theyd would ave cut off the game at a certain point ."
4912,"yep . it 's impressive how far they league has come . int he 1960s , bowlers were making more than football players , which would be unheard of today ."
4913,"yeah , its changed . engineers still earn more in their lives than the average football or my player . guess i should go back to school lol"
4914,"yep . of course , you probably would n't do much bible study if you went back for engineering . they used to incorporate the book as pat of regular education , but that stopped in 1963 ."
4915,"yeh , they could teach thomas jefferson 's version . he cut out all the parts eh did n't like with a razor"
4916,"interesting approach by m i jefferson , although he wass worm in on the bible . and teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams were sworn in on something othe that the bible ."
4917,i did n't even know that was an option ! i also did n't know that malus means both apple and evil
4918,lean somethng new every day . perhaps that 's is tom brady keeps going . i would n't mind if he hung i sup and allowed some of the other teams to get a chance at winning one pr wo super bowls .
4919,i agree . he 's 40 . time to step aside lol man !
4920,"hello , are you a fan of the nfl ?"
4921,"i am a pretty big fan . it 's tough taht it 's over , busta t least there is a new aaf league . what about you ?"
4922,yeh i watch it from time to time . did you know women can play too ?
4923,"interesting . while it might the tough for them to compete physically like that , there is n't a rule against it i guess ? i wonder how the new orleans saints would deal with that , because their cheerleaders ca n't even be int he same restaurant as the players !"
4924,i think that rule needs to get out of there . the worst part is that they have to leave mid meal if a player walks in
4925,"i wonder what caused it , but there must have been a time when that fraternization was frowned upon . as much as they invest in the players , maybe it makes sense ? after all they have created chips that track almost every outfield movement , maybe they need one for offfieldt soo ?"
4926,maybe so . i hope the dark they are collecting in the field though can somehow be used to like the game q litte bit safer
4927,amazing taht a game while averages just over 01 minutes of actual gameplay an be so damaging to playes .
4928,great point . do you know what the highest score recorded in a game was ?
4929,"i 'd be really curious to know , what was it ?"
4930,it eas 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
4931,"wow ! no wonder i never heard of cumberland before . maybe they should have painted their locker room pink like iowa does now , just to give them any psychological edge ."
4932,yeah that is a good point her . did you know they are using tracking chips on th players now ?
4933,"i was aware or that and mentioned it a little easier . i gues step need to track everything . football players have short careers . despite hat they make , it 's interesting that engineers make ore over ac career thas someone playing in the nfl ."
4934,yeah i think that explains that . on another topic do you know much about the bible ?
4935,"i know a fair amount , but i ' v never been much form emorizing chapter and verse likes ome people . i guess i was born a little too late and reading the bible was nola longer part o elementary school ."
4936,"yeah , interesting that is used to be part o elementary education up until ' 6 . that i pretty late"
4937,"i am sure president thomas jefferson knew it well , but he also makes is own bible . i guess he did n't agree is what he considered supernatural , and cut all those things out of his version ."
4938,"yeah , he certainly did not seem to believe in resurrection and the miracles that are within the bible"
4939,"i wonder if he was sworn i using his personal version or the standard one ? two us presidents , teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams , did n't use a bible when they were sworn in though ."
4940,"yeah good point , i bet you he used his own version . seems the cover of babel is likely based on a place that exists now"
4941,any idea where that is located ? maybe somewhere in the middle east ?
4942,yes it seems it is located in the modern day iraq and it is known s thee etemenanki
4943,"interesting . i know that there are things we taken for granted with hte bible as well . for example , ' apple ' as ' in the bible until it was translated into latin ."
4944,yea from the word malus which coincidentally also translated to evel
4945,so tom brady wastes to equate football with religion ?
4946,"yeah , that is quite strange , ? n't you think ?"
4947,"probably as much about promoting his book , t he tbs method , as anything else . nothing like a bit of self promotion ll"
4948,"yes , but it could have been a book just bout training , or nutrition , why mix philosophy in it ?"
4949,"maybe the whole celebrity thing . people admire you for ne , footbal , in this case , and all of a sudden youth honk you 're an expert on everything ."
4950,"yeah , you are probably right , but some really like this approach , adn see this as an uniting thing for the us . that i think it is too much ."
4951,"is n't there that concept , that od complex , there yo have an inflated opinion of yourself . still , he is good at what he does . i know it ; e about football , but i know tom brady is very good ."
4952,"when they won hte super bowl when they were down 28 to 3 , is nothing short of a miracle . maybe it started there ."
4953,"glad point . do you watch much football ? i come from a city with a chemically bad team , it 's difficult to ge into it when they are that bad ."
4954,"as long it is not cumberland wheat hey lost 2022 toga georgia tech , it is ok ."
4955,not a good score to gave on your resume . i think if were on the losing say i 'd give up football and take up bible studies .
4956,"which version , the supernaturalfree of thomas jefferson , or the clones where teh apple i not mentioned ?"
4957,"i once read a book which take about how the bible has changed over the years because sometimes they are translations o translations of translations , each time it changed slightly but the number of times made big alteratosn from the original ."
4958,"yeah , it makes you think what is right about the bible , made that 's why thomas jefferson cut all teh miraculous parts of teh bible ."
4959,"i wonder why those two presidents , roosevelt and adams did n't use the bible to wear in ? there would eb uproar if someone did that now ."
4960,"at these time freedom meant freedom , not ' you are free to think the wa i think ' , i wonder what they used at th swearing ceremony ."
4961,i 'd be curious to see jefferson 's bible after he finished goin at it with a razor ?
4962,"it was probably a very thick bible with aside pages , because if it was sided , he would have cut words of the side of teh page . bu it would have still looked strange ."
4963,"maybe if i ever et a copy of ' the tbs method ' , i 'll use a razor to cut out all the parts that mention football and religion ."
4964,"hire would not much left , but maybe i 'll buy it , i have a few pounds 5o lose ."
4965,"i 'm going to go and look it up on amazon , have a good day . goodbye ."
4966,"did you know tom brady has his own bible , the ' athletes bieber ' ?"
4967,no . i had heard thaat .
4968,"there seems to be a sort of spiritual element to the pat 's . the say ' in bill we trust , ' referring to coach belichick ."
4969,"belichick is good . but i am not a big fan of the ; patriots , being i am a packer fan ."
4970,"chiefs fan myself . . . the pat ? 's player matthew smaller is actually an revenge ; list off the field , adding to their spirituality thing ."
4971,they do seem lke they back a lot of luck . maybe its spiritual
4972,"not with the rams apparently . even so , brady shows no sign of quitting football for now ."
4973,he is slowing down . he isnt what he was
4974,"yeah . at least the nfl is making warm ore than pro bowlers now unlike , e in the 1960 's ."
4975,that was a pay base fo players back then
4976,yep . my alma mater beat cumberland 220 i 1916 . i 'm not sure i 'm from do that .
4977,i guess tech wanted to make ensure they stayed down
4978,"the coaches must have hated each other . speaking of the pat 's , former rb benjarvus ellis never fumbled in his nfl career ."
4979,i know . stats amazing
4980,yes indeed . . . i did n't realize hat the nfl 's average gameplay is only 11 minutes . that seems way low .
4981,i had heard that one before
4982,have you heard that the nfl has no written rule that prohibits women from playing ?
4983,yes . i know .
4984,they would use to get a little religion like students back in 1930 . it as n't uncommon for them to have to read from the buble in school .
4985,yes . the bible is considered the best selling book of all time
4986,yes and that does n't count all the free ones . thanks for the chat !
4987,"hello , have you heard about tom brady 's newt cook , 'it he tb1w2 method ' ?"
4988,"years , i hav no i have not read about it though . what is the book about ?"
4989,"basically , the book i abou tom 's plan of action for your life . he talks about joy , good health , and peak performance and those things that play a part in star lifestyle ."
4990,do you like tom brady ? i am not his fan ut i admire his accomplishment .
4991,i az not tht familiar with brady but i 've heard a lot about him in the news lately especially since the patriots won the super bowl .
4992,do you like football ? are you familiar with the nfl ?
4993,i am somewhat familiar but probably not as much as you are . i would rather go to live games and such them play .
4994,"there acre 32 teams within the nfl . ; which one is your favorite team , if any ?"
4995,i like th patriots since they re the winners ! i just old out the nfl is divided up between the nfc and afc .
4996,"i think they are divided evenly . apparently , teh nfl has no written rule against women football players ."
4997,"yes , i about tha t ? anyone can play as long as htey meet the league eligibility requirements . did you know that the 's only 11 minutes of game play in an average nfl game ?"
4998,"i is found out recently . i could not believe it . so , what did the players do most of the time then ?"
4999,"most of the time is actually taken up with calls on plays , calculating garage , etc , etc . also , as a matter of trivia , did you know that the highest score in a football and was 222 to 0 ?"
5000,i heard about it but i do not remember which teams played that particular game . i would like to know who won an ho lost very badly .
5001,"ok , i can help you out with that . yes , that was back in 1916 where georgia tech defeated cumberland by 222 points to zero l wow , what shame that must ave brought !"
5002,"i wonder i cumberland players were walking around on the filed seeing . by the way , do you know who cares up weigh they yellow line on the football field ?"
5003,"yes , that was espn who actually won an emmy for that strategy to superimpose that yellow line on the screen to mark first down . how genus as that ?"
5004,i straw very genus . i can not imagine any football field without the yellow line .
5005,"yes , a lot of innovations for football have come out of this century bu ta lot of drawbacks as well . did you know that he ne orleans saint 's cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any fl player ? and if thet are already dining in a restaurant and an nfl player comes in afterward , the cheerleaders must like ? i 'd say that 's a step back !"
5006,"i do not like that at all . if they cheerleaders are already at the restaurna6 , they should be allowed to finish their meal . i wonder who came up with that odd t e ."
5007,"yes , i wonder too . well , nice chatting with you , have a good one ."
5008,have you read tom brady 's cook ?
5009,"no i have not , have you ?"
5010,nope do n't plan to . apparently it 's his plan for life . i wonder if other quarterbacks will read it .
5011,i do n't it heal much to do with quartrerbacking . it 's more about his physical and mental awareness and grew . i don ' y think it is a football book per se .
5012,well according to chopin tom is after something greater than football .
5013,"probalby a zen type of book , trying to find the meaning of life or some kind of spiritual journey ."
5014,"all football is the meaning for him in one statement and in another he requires more . i think i 'll bet watch bum keep playing football , lol !"
5015,s do you like the nfl ? my favorite team is the dallas cowboys in the nfc . one day they will read 'the upper bowl again .
5016,mine is still the green bay packers out of th 32 teams .
5017,"nice , i watch those games for over 3 hours yet there is only like 10 minutes of actual gameplay . but still it 's my favorite sport ."
5018,"i know right , we have to ge watching a lot of commercials then . there re going to start putting tracking chips in the players padding ."
5019,"i think its a good idea , maybe they can help with the concussion issues they have and help quartrrbacking by tracking rotation rand bal , l speed et ."
5020,"yeah day a good reason , but i tell you the way technology is going who know what will we else whew were old . do you read the bible ?"
5021,"no , i have read it though . it is the most bestselling book in existence after all ."
5022,your right 5 billion copies and the moon influential of all time . you thomas jefferson used a razor to remove all the supernatural as aspects like the resurrection and miracles .
5023,"id didn ot know that , i do know that teddy roosevelt would not swear on a bible to be inaugurated a spresijdemt . so it is not requires by law apparently ."
5024,yea hi heard that neither did johns quincy adam . i 'm also aware that the tower of babel is probably a real building in modern day iraq .
5025,"it woudl malek sense , much o 'the bible was writting im and about that region ."
5026,true . the bible is considered to be the inspired word of god .
5027,"who knows maybe in 200 years people will treat tom brady 's book as reverently a he bible . there is oven a documentary called ' tom gs time ' mad about it ,"
5028,hey i 'll be long gone my friend bu thou right who knows . hi spook world be the center of civilization . nice chatting with you .
5029,"religion and football , it you think teh have similarities ;"
5030,i think if you look hard enough you fined similarity in everything . you ?
5031,"not really , but i gyess i respect bradys opinion on the matter , he is a great player and takes his job seriously"
5032,yeah apparently bravado ice cream is a secret of his . you ever had it ?
5033,"no , but i might that . maybe that will boost my athletic capabilities and i cna become age creat qb"
5034,you never now . as far as religion goes brady has made football hs .
5035,"well he does breathe footbal l , eat football and sleep football . he has a strong will and determination . his success with the patriots is proof of that ."
5036,i agree you ca n't take anything away from his accomplishments but the messier .
5037,"it does seem exaggerated , but many fans look at him thet was , i wonder what are their views on bill belichick"
5038,i dont know ut brady appears to be on another level . i wonder if it has anything to do with his friends . york now the son of deepfake chopin .
5039,"i have no clue about that , but i find interesting how espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow first down line"
5040,"i love that line , haha ! hey did ou know that jefferson created his own version of the bible ?"
5041,"i didnt know that , was it similar to the original one ?"
5042,"i do n't know but apparently he cut with a razor all the parts about miracles , the resurrection and supernatural events ."
5043,"i wonder why he did that , maybe eh didnt agree with that part of the bible ,"
5044,"well those are the most important parts , kind of weird e shih ; a have just bought a nonfiction book instead ."
5045,"yeah seems like a better way , reading an on fiction book and leaving that poor bible alone , if you dont agree with a book you shouldnt take it out on it"
5046,"right , to funny ! hey you know there were to presidents that did not uss the bible at their swearing in ?"
5047,"no , who were those presidents ? i bet htey werent religious and also that it cost them votes later"
5048,well it was teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams . i wonder if they used anything else on bust he a promise to do right by the constitution .
5049,"that is an interesting thing to google ,"
5050,"hi , how are you ? do you know much about the bible ?"
5051,"yes , do you like fooball ?"
5052,"yes , i do . did you know that before 1963 , it was not uncommon for american students to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education ?"
5053,"yes , i did ! do you liek the patriots ? tom brady ?"
5054,"do n't know much about teh patriots or tom brady . did you kno wthe thomas jefferson created his own version of the bible , cutting out the 'supernatural ' parts , such as the miracles and teh resurrection ?"
5055,"yes , i wonder why he did that ? teddy roosevelt and john adams only two who did not use the bible for swearing inc ceremonies s ?"
5056,jefferson wanted to see religion in humanity term . i think it and ja swore on the constitution . they felt that they owed allegiance to the people and the government first .
5057,"intereting , i did n't know the word apple in latin is malus ?"
5058,it that is an interesting coincidence .
5059,did you know the nfl has no rules sagainsw6 women playing ?
5060,that 's great ! there should a team entirely of women !
5061,"that would be interesting to watch ! with only 11 minutes of live game play on average , gives tiem to eat football treats or standing i inline at teh stadium . lol"
5062,i figure the best way to watch the game is to look at highlight see did you know that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer ar higher than the average lifetime earnings of a new layer ?
5063,that is surprising . cameo scene with the average player . do you watch the new orlean saints ?
5064,"o , i dont ' really watch their games . the they any goo d ?"
5065,"yes , thinking their cheerleaders might have a problem having tolt even the restaurant if a player comes in ."
5066,that true . that sexist thinking is out of date .
5067,"very , having tracking chips in balls and shoulder pads is a great idea !"
5068,i think if might holes prevent injury .
5069,"benjarvus greenellis is a great player , never to fumble the ball !"
5070,he is a that player . he should get an award or a tour for tht !
5071,"i agree , something to be recognized ! ! great chat ! !"
5072,"great chat , cat !"
5073,have a great day ! !
5074,do you like footbal ?
5075,i do . i like tom brady . do you ?
5076,"i love tom brady , his the best player of the nfl histoy in my opinion"
5077,he plays football like it is his religion . he even had a book called ' athlete 's bible . '
5078,"i would like to eat that book , he says that par of his success is due toe acting avocado ice cream , sounds a bit disgusting"
5079,"that is gross . , he is very focused on the whys of life ."
5080,"yeah well he must be doing something right , he is 0 and his still on top of his name ,"
5081,bad is a kind of messier figure for patriots fans .
5082,"i can see why , h ewan lead them to various superbowls , i think that 4 or 5 of them or even more"
5083,brady 's commitment to the 12 method is sincere . he works hard .
5084,"he does for hard , the success of the patriots isnt due to good lucy k , so do you have a favorite team ?"
5085,i 'm married to a broncos fan . did you know the former patriots rb greenellis has never fumbled in his nfl career .
5086,"i didnt , i love to watch him play but didnt know he holds that record , he must one the only rb in the history of the nfl"
5087,i did n't realize there were 32 teams .
5088,"yeah 32 teams , 6 in each division ,"
5089,snakes sense . i read that the average game only as 11 minutes of live gameplay .
5090,"only 11 minutes of game play ? that does n't seem like a lot , i guess ads time too much of the time"
5091,also the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player
5092,"thaat seem about tight , engineers tend to work for a longer time , footbal players have shorter carreers"
5093,that is what i was thinking and no cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restraudsnt as any nfl player
5094,that is an awful rule but i guess there must be a good reason behind that .
5095,"hi , do you watch the nfl ?"
5096,hey and very much so . do you have a favorite team ?
5097,oh yea hi love tom brady the guys is a legend . how about tou ?
5098,"agreed , same here . i you know he is a good author now as well ' ?"
5099,"i have yet to hear it but it is that book the tbs method , the athlete 's bible ."
5100,yeah i want to read it too . i heard they are also doing a documentary featuring him too
5101,"that should be interesting . he ahs a favorite ice cream flavor , do you know what it is ?"
5102,i think it is avocado . i guess it makes sense since he is so wealthy .
5103,yeah for sure . dogs you know women can play in the nfl ?
5104,yeah as long as they meet the requirements . i wonder if anyone has tried
5105,i wonder too actually . did tou know overs heir lifetime engineers have more ?
5106,yeah apparently i guess it makes sense since they have a longer career soo
5107,exactly . i heard nfl is planting chips on the player 's pads now
5108,yes it seems they are collecting stuff lie velocity and rotation and such .
5109,exactly . do you now who benjarvus greenellis is ?
5110,"yup he is amazing , he never fumbled the ball in his career"
5111,oh he was amazing . do you know the score in the game that went down in history as the highest one ?
5112,yea that was geogia tech crushing cumberland 2220
5113,"yule be spun won an emmy once , do you know wat for ?"
5114,"yeah for the superimposed yellow line , pretty cool"
5115,i tix for sure . do you know much about the bible ?
5116,but a ton but i know that it was sold over 5 billion copies wow
5117,a it is one of the most influential books in history
5118,ar eyou a football fan ?
5119,"hi ! i watch it from time to tim e , a re you . have a favorite player or team"
5120,i only watch a little . i dont really have a favorite player .
5121,"i think a famous one is tom brady , especially with the release of his docuseries called ' tom vs . time ' , have you seen or heard about it ?"
5122,"i haven seen it but i have heard about it , you ?"
5123,"i have n't , i think a lot of people have n't seen it is because it 's broadcasted o facebook watch , do you use that feature of facebook ?"
5124,"i do not , ill catch some stuff there once in a while but ot regularly . i heard his tbs method is like a religion to some"
5125,yeah people invest a lot of hope into the team . they eve shaved their own creed called ' in bill we trust ' for their worship of the patriot 's coal .
5126,"even though they describe him as a raggamuffin , them still love him . he doesnt have brady 's charisma though"
5127,"haha , what 's a raggamuffin ? what did he dot o warrant tthat nickname ?"
5128,its is floppy looking fashion sense . kind of kempt .
5129,"oh ok , i did n't know that about him . maybe bil was hoping the camera 's would n't focus on his fashion style since there 's only eleven minutes of live gameplay ."
5130,crazy that really is all that there is when games take 34 hours .
5131,"yeah , i devote an entire afternoon to watch th game , if the games were longer than eleven minutes , i think i 'd be a tough potato the whole cary ! do n't think i mind that too much though ."
5132,same here . id live on the couch if that were the case and get far less room tha n't already do .
5133,"with only eleven minutes of gameplay , they still earn millions but somehow bowlers back in the day made much more than nfl players , hard to believe that still exists today ."
5134,true . i wonder how much each was making in th 60 's to make it even . was bowling ever that popular .
5135,"yeh , does professional still exist ? i 'd imagine sports companies would n't be able to vendors them because i do n't think they make any bowling clothes ."
5136,"true , i ca n't name one professional bowler , past or present ."
5137,"me neither , i nothing , i definitely don ? 're think they are broadcasted on sunday which is the football games are broadcasted and super bowl is held first sunday in february ."
5138,"some popular tv shows dont even want to compete with that . its been great chatting , but i must get going . have a great day !"
5139,howdy ! are you a fan of football ?
5140,yeah i love it . what do you think of tom brady ?
5141,no denying his brilliant on the field of play or many accomplishments .
5142,yea hit apparently has book called he athlete bible .
5143,have tou read it ? i hear it is his method of pursuing high performance .
5144,no i have n't but some ; elle say it kind of curtis . he has some fans that fall him the messier
5145,"probably hal for boston . . . i think heh s age food head on his shoulder nd his game play shows he is a serious person , dedicated to performing at the highest level possible . i would imagine his book is a legitimate exercise in sharing what he believes are keys to helping him stay in top for ."
5146,yeah i agree he subscribes to avocado ice cream have you ever had it ?
5147,"no , , but i 'm interested ! i once read a quote strom brady which read , ' if you 're going ot compete against e , you better be willing ot give up your life because i 'm giving up mine ' you know , whatever you believe you were made 5o do , yo have to admire someone who is dedicated so much o himself to do what he thinks is his mission ."
5148,yeah that 's is dedication . apparently his wall for his life is all part of the 1912 method .
5149,that is living intentionally . it does see bazaar that someone might dedicate himself to a game that only has an average of 11 minutes of playing time each wee . neat 's a lot of preparation for such a small amount of lime .
5150,well i'ts try it a lit to do with hte pay . tom has made it his religion according to chopin .
5151,"well , he is focused on his game and shows no sigh of quitting anytime soon . who knows , maybe he will be the first b to reach 7 nfl championships ?"
5152,if anyone can it 's him . have you seen tom vs . time ?
5153,"no . i heard o fit , but i have not . i wonder if it is on youtube ?"
5154,i think it 's on facebook some how . he said he went to knows h why 's of life .
5155,"do n't we all ! like , what id the univ of iowa paint the visitor locker room pink ?"
5156,i buss the coach thought he take ever advantage . didn of sad really or maybe it was a joke . did you know hte highest scored game was 2200 ?
5157,"if an average game eis only 11 minutes , that and the one team scored 20 points per minute ! good heavens !"
5158,yeah that ridiculous . georgia tech and cumberland were the teams back in 1916 l
5159,nice chanting !
5160,hi ! are you a fan of the nfl ?
5161,i love to watch football but do n't get to as much anymore . you ?
5162,"same , i cut cable . while ago , so i don time as much . but i hear tom brady has relaly been dominating lately ."
5163,yeah i think this is his 5th ring . apparently he has some regiment called tbs method taht includes avocado ice cream .
5164,avocado ice cream sounds like something someone would either love or hate . but something has to be working because hehe is 40 and still going .
5165,yeah i guess your right . did you know that once upon a time bowler made twice as much a tv nfl players ?
5166,"that is crazy ! i wonder what the pay was then ? i think it is kinda high now , especially when you look at the fact that their is only 11 minutes of game play during any given game ."
5167,"rights , i think all sports player are over paid . they need to use some of that money to pay for universal health care in my opinion ."
5168,i agree . though the earning of an engineer over their life time re higher stat th earnings of a football payer . that makes me feel a little better .
5169,until you think about retirement age . i 'll have ten and out with millions over forty plus and out with millions . lol . what about you ?
5170,same here . i would rather a few years to make my millions .
5171,iowa states visiting locker room is painted pink .
5172,nice intimidation tactic . i guess that was be shocking the first time you see it .
5173,"yeah and after words , and neon a subconscious leave , you know hte highest scoring game of all time ?"
5174,yeah it was 2220 . what a blow out !
5175,yeah georgia tech was not playing around . i would have hated to be o nthe bus ride home to cumberland .
5176,"agreed , or have my name associated with that team . tha must haven even a rough game fo the , ."
5177,on a different note do you own a bible ?
5178,i do . i hav done more reading from the ones in apps recently though . it is interesting taht thomas jefferson used a razor to make his own version cutting out the supernatural parts . well i have to go . nice chat
5179,you too ! yes that is weird should have just bought a fiction book .
5180,for real !
5181,"who knew brady as so spiritual , did you know not only is he a famous football played he has been successful in writing and now in a creepy spiritual quest . i love him : ,"
5182,i think he is certainly a dominant force in football . he is har it beat .
5183,"yes ! he was jnbelpievaqble ! brady and the patriots are favored to wi nine teh super bowl lii . as an see it . . . also , have you tried avocado ice cream ? ! its one of bradys fav flavors ha , ha btw not add ive tried it . . have you ?"
5184,"i have n't but i think i would like to , i like avocado and grace so i think it would be pretty hood ."
5185,"its good , just make sure it has almonds ! it makes it better ."
5186,i 'll ahve to do it . have you read his book ?
5187,athlete 's bible i think its called . ive never read it but id be interested in taking a lot inside of that beautiful mind . lol
5188,i think he falls wise methods the tbs echo .
5189,"i didn ' known he was 40 ! i definitely want to know his secrets . goes to show you money is not everything . he has it all yet he is still looking for a meaning to life . successfull career , a beautiful top model wife , money , loads of t , kids a house , materials everything but still looking for a meaning . . . its beautiful tha own can all relate even if our lives are completely different . we are a ; coen ."
5190,"i know ! h e is still playing at a tip top level , a nd winning ."
5191,it would be interesting to see his tracking numbers . since the nfl las a chip embedded in the footballs and in the shoulder of the players to measure speed and distance .
5192,"it would , and the ball to see exactly how fast he can fling it ."
5193,yes ! and who knew that the average nfl game has only 12 minutes of live game play ! my father and law and husband make it feel like eternal haha
5194,that is because it is an eternity . i mean 4 hours for 11 minutes of play ? not the quickest game in the world .
5195,"just lilke monopoly ! i could do it , im too impatient and not that strong for football . im afraid ill break something these days . even though it build be interesting to see a real in the nfl , hopefully someday we see it , there are currently ho written cruel against female players"
5196,as long as they are great better tha the cheerleaders i think it could be a good thing . they dont treat cheerleaders too well .
5197,"oh true ! thats what i heard ! especially in the new orleans saints , k apparantly cheerleaders a be in the sam restaurant as the players . if they are the must leave . . . thats terrible . i wonder why"
5198,i do know what kind of accident could have prompted a rule like that . it is a little overboard in my opinion .
5199,"your right , something must of happened ; time assure have changed , for starter shack in th 1960 's top bowlers made twice az much as top football stars !"
5200,"hat is crazy , i wonder ow good the pay was . i mean if bowlers were gettin the same pay it couldnt have been great . nothing like what engineers made at the time ."
5201,you are right 2 i could n't believe it . the average engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and mlb . soccer in the highest paid however .
5202,"do , how are you ? do you know much about teh bible ?"
5203,"hello , i 'm doing well ! i know a little bit k i thing it 's interesting how religious books are similar , like the old testament overlaps what the here bible and the greek septuagint ."
5204,"they are all in the abraham tradition . the idea date back very far . did you know that before 1963 , it was not uncommon for american students to be required to read from the bible a spare tofu heir elementary education ?"
5205,"i did not know that q but thinking about it , l it makes sense . w really have it ingrained so much in soviets . i think teddy roosevelt is one of the only president ho did n't swear in on th edible"
5206,the either is john quincy adams . they swore on the constitution because the felt that they owed allegiance to the people and the government first .
5207,"ahh ok , that 's interesting . it 's good for people in power to have choice like that . thomas jefferson had his own version of the bible , after he cut out parts using a razor ."
5208,he was a practical gay and wanted to see religion in humanity terms .
5209,"it 's interesting bow the bible draws from real life ss will . i was shocked o find out the tower f babel was likely based off of the real line building , the etemenanki ."
5210,"the bible has a lot of convictions to be relax word . linguistically too . an apple only became known as an ' apple ' when the bible was translated into latin in the 4th century . the reason : the word ' malus ' means both apple and i , ."
5211,"that 's interesting ! i think it 's surprising the disagreements people have over the bible , i always thought of it as straight forward ! but i guess some people disagree what parts of i should be included in the canon ."
5212,"i in there are political motivations bind that , , ike in the case of jefferson . leaders want certain beliefs to be followed ."
5213,"i think that 's fair . regardless it 's clear many , many people have considered it interesting enough to buy . it 's technically the bestselling book of all time with 5 billion copies ."
5214,they might hot know the controversy behind what got chosen fo go into the book . so much has been left out .
5215,"yeah that 's very true . speaking of controversy , did you know in the 60 , if cheerleaders are eating in a restaurant and players come in at r , teh cheerleaders still have to leave ? that 's terrible ."
5216,the women in the nfl get treated lke seconds glass citizens . it 's shameful .
5217,"definitely , but at the same time that has it even more surprising female players are technically allowed !"
5218,they would be better off as engineers in the long run . no concussions !
5219,"that true , and . than that , do n't engineers make more ? i think on average they have higher lifetime earnings than fl players , and even mlb players also !"
5220,"i 'm not surprised . nfl players have short careers , due to injury and age . anyway , i enjoyed chatting with you q"
5221,"definitely , but it 's also surprising considering there 's only 11 minutes of actual live play every game ."
5222,true . only 11 minutes stretched over hours . not what you 'd think .
5223,but definitely nice chatting with you as well l have a good night !
5224,hello . do you like avocado ice cream ? tim brady does .
5225,its what us keeping him on the top of his name
5226,"i think i would have to pass , as it sounds disgusting . i did n't realize he and depart chopin 's son were friends . also weird that depart would name his son gotham ."
5227,yes he did . i would like to read his book ' athlete 's bible '
5228,"i 'm not reading anything from an nfl player , until they demand that hte saints stop that insane rule that their cheerleaders have to leave ar restaurant if a player comes in ."
5229,tha it so wrong . that makes me mad just thinking bout it . at least women can play in the nfl
5230,"as long as they meet the eligibility requirements , and i ' k sure many do ."
5231,i did not know the espn created the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line
5232,"they won an emmy for it . that must have been an awful year , if that is what won ."
5233,and if i were cumberland
5234,what is cumberland ?
5235,im sorry i hit enter before finishing . i was saying that if i were cumberland i would have quit playing that game after the 1st 100 points
5236,oh . the georgia tech game e ! why did't the coached stop that ? they do in high school games .
5237,i would have wanted to be a bowler instead of a player in the 60 's
5238,even engineers make more money that a player . i don ? t think i could have watched pro bowling though .
5239,i never knew that greenellis has never fumbled the al ; . i wonder if he is the only one
5240,"probably , s those tracking chips in the balls register everything ."
5241,'s thomas jefferson did not believe in miracles and the resurrection .
5242,a lot of people do . maybe bradys hound e give na copy of his bible .
5243,yes because the bible is the best selling book ever .
5244,tom brady 's bible ?
5245,no the holy bible
5246,do you watch the nfl ?
5247,"yes , the nfl is one of the major sports leagues in north america and the highest professional football league in the world ."
5248,"way about the other kind of football like soccer , do you watch them ?"
5249,"yes , footbal . is the team sports which is referred by different names in different place . but every one like ut to play ."
5250,ye buy do you like to watch soccer ? or rugby or canadia football ?
5251,i like all the time my favourite player is rugby . which is your favourite game ?
5252,"i like canadia football , it is like the nfl , but slightly modified ."
5253,"th ends regular season run from september to december , each hav to play 16 games with each other ."
5254,"do you think it s enough ? i would like to see more games , do n't you ?"
5255,which is your favorite team ?
5256,"i like the pats , tom brady is super good , he wrote a book , the 1912 method , it is very food ."
5257,"tom brady is the best player in new zealand patriot , he played top of his lame at age 40 ."
5258,"yeah , the pats were losing . to 3 in the same bowl , but to won in overtime . they are legendary ."
5259,"it 7 , 1916 was the sad day for a , brand bulldogs or losing the match its georgia tech ."
5260,yeah that was a great game for one of them and a horribly game fo the other . how would you feel if you were on the losing team ?
5261,"winnings or loosing is not am latter . how they played is everything , next time they want to work hard for their winning ."
5262,"yeah but losing 2220 , youth ave to feel something . i woudl be lacosta proud ."
5263,its very shocking . but we want to identify our mistakes and correct them and move to the next game .
5264,"d n't you think , it would be better just to forget to the game , because a loss of 222 points there nothing to learn fro mit ."
5265,what we want to do ?
5266,"i would go to bar and just forget the game , and think about the next game as if the 222 loss never happened ."
5267,"just relax , t he team wa improved and work hard to improve the game ."
5268,"maybe they have read the bible to get peace . it was until 1963 that us student were required to read the bible in ac classroom , that is quite shocking ."
5269,bible is the relation between he god and human . it give more confident and god always with us .
5270,"but an version is so different , which one is the right one ? even thomas jefferson modified it ?"
5271,"yes , the biblical tower of babel was likely based on a real building , in modern iraq ."

5304,"i am not sure actually . maybe more of them are becoming engineer s , threat is a better profession"
5305,well engineers make more money because tshirt careers are longer so i would opt for that too
5306,yeah i think that plays a lot into that . did you hear about tracking hips on the players ?
5307,the are using them to track rotation and velocity and a bunch of other stuff during the gaines
5308,yeah exactly . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
5309,"the guy is a legend , he was ever fumbled the ball in his career"

5320,yes me too . did you know the u of iowa visitor locker room is pink ?

5322,seems like it . do you know what the highest core in a game is ?
5323,"yes if i am right , in was 2220 georgia tech vs cumberland , have you heard of cumberland before ?"
5324,i have actually not and that is quite the score . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
5325,yes for creation of the yellow linear representing meh first down for football .
5326,yeah . did you know women can play in the nfl ?
5327,do you think they should d ? 2000 bus men hitting smaller women would certainly make thing different .
5328,neat that is a good point . be they should stick o engineering there is more money there
5329,"he i agree , i think how is great and maybe women should get a lot women pro team called wnfl and see how that work out for them ."
5330,yah tha would be great . did you know they are using trackers in the players now ?
5331,"yes , is that used to keep track of nfl players , i wonder why , this should bell ike invading their private lives , thats st my opinion ."
5332,it is only used in th field to track their velocity ad rotation and such . hopefully they can use that to make the game safer too
5333,"yes , you are right , this is good for their safety , do you agree that the average nfl games last 11 minutes ?"
5334,it seems that the are pretty short yeah but we have to be glued to the tv for hours until that ends
5335,"but don ' you think that 's a little too short to be divide into 4 quarter , quarterback plays , running back play s , kicks filed goals thats too much for 11 minutes ."
5336,i think that 1 minutes take into account only the time tey are running around nd not when they get into position and such . not sure but it kind that us that it is
5337,"it got to be something like that , may , it average take me eleven minutes just eat , hahahaha ."
5338,"on another topic , do you know much about the biber ?"
5339,"are you a nfl fan ? back in the 60s , pro bowlers actually made more money than pro football players ! crazy huh ?"
5340,that is crazy . i think they all are paid pretty well today .
5341,"yeah , especially qb 's like brady . he has a book out entitled ' the athlete 's bible ' ."
5342,in my opinion religion nanu esports dont mix . its just a way for him to make some more money .
5343,"i 'm not sur i 's all about religion . i think it 's more about mental preparation and eve one 's physical health , e . g . , nutrition , ; ."
5344,"well that make sa little but more sense , i still think it all about the money he will get from it though ."
5345,"his , gift as a model , actually make more than him . i also not so sure he 's doing it for money . he made e . there are really religious people on his team like matt lauer . thye ? s an evangelist off the field ."
5346,its nice to know some of those guys are still good moral characters . with all the off the field trouble you hear about of athletes .
5347,true . the od the ana treat thee likd deities . theyd ay ' in bill we trust ' about the coach and some see brady as a messier .
5348,in m opinion there is only one nesiah . h certainly isnt a football player . dont get me wrong i love football . i just dont go that deep with it .
5349,"no one should . it 's a game . btw , a short game . they say there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay in an nfl game . i find that hard to believe ."
5350,"i believe it . most of the late is getting ready fort h next play , and then most plays last like 7s seconds ."
5351,"i played in hs and there was a lot of standing around . speaking of the pats , farmer rb greenellis never fumbled the ball in his nfl career . good hands !"
5352,yeah thats pretty amazing considering how physical the game is .
5353,i 'm also amazed that the u . of iowa has a pink locker room for visitors .
5354,yeah that seems like they are going to some pretty good lengths to get into the head of the opponents .
5355,"yeah , that 's what brady 's book i supposed o be about . i just learned that teddy roosevelt and jon q . adams are the only presidents that did n't use a bible to get sworn in . i wonde that they used ?"
5356,i dont think they used anything . i wonder if they were artists or why they didnt swear in on the bible .
5357,i ca n't see that but maybe . is n't it wild that they think they would the actual tower of babel in iraq ?
5358,that is wild .
5359,"in the end , everyone does their own thing . jefferson cut out ' supernatural ' , e . g . , miracles , in his own bible ."
5360,oh yeah . to each his own i gues it i like my bible the way it was written by food chat
5361,hey are you a football fan ?
5362,"yeah , he 's smart t , i believe his methods hat involves lots of avocado ice cream to help him stay at the top of his game is brilliant !"
5363,"yeah if you like avocado ice cream , lo l ! i think he calls it the tbs method ."
5364,"yeah , t om brady , that is . he is surprisingly spiritual ."
5365,i did not know taht about him . he 's got like 5 rings now right ?
5366,"i believe so . it 's crazy to think , on average football games have 11 minutes of actual playing , yet there is so much excitement with watching them ."
5367,right ! hey i guess the iowa coach thought painting he visiting locker room pink was a good strategy .
5368,many strange thins ahve happened . decades ago bowlers made more than football players .
5369,yeah ish ear twice as much and that georgia tech cumberland game was played in 1916 .
5370,it is a game i grew up loving to watch .
5371,that 's great . did you know that espn won she award .
5372,yes ! it is so interesting to earn the history behind things such as teh symbols representing first down lines in american football games .
5373,i have n't heard about have . i do know the re going t add tracking chips in the padding of the players .
5374,"yeah , that is a good idea o malek oversight of the game and makeup calls more accurate ."
5375,"pretty soon will be watching drones , ll ! you know the nfl only produced one left handed quarterbacks ?"
5376,"yeah , i furthermore , be we 'll see women in hte nfl , since there is no written rule forbidding them from joining ."
5377,if so make a all women 's team like the wnba
5378,"yeah , if women do enter the nfl , i 'm sure issues of fairness between players will arise ."
5379,right it will change the game forever . apparently the lifetime earnings of a nfl players does n't compare to that of a engineer .
5380,"with that in mind , maybe being an engineer would be a better idea ."
5381,well only for the long run . give me a pofessionla 10 year career a sa player and then retirement any day .
5382,true . well it was nice talking !
5383,you too ! do n't forget to try the avocado ice cream
5384,"hello , are you particularly a fan of football ?"
5385,i love football bug i do n't gret to watch much anymore it i hear tom b wrote a boo k .
5386,"he did , ' the 2022 method ' right ? i think it was interesting , one of the things i learnt is his love for ' avocado ice cream ' , would never have guessed that as his secret ."
5387,"i would ahve never guessed avocado 's could eb mate into an ice cream , lol . apparently football has become his religion , though ."
5388,"and i didnt et that at find but i think it makes sense , he 's so dedicated to it . i read something by spiritual writer deepfake chopin explaining the similarities between sports and religion ."
5389,ok is that his deepfake ' soon gotham chopin ? he said tom want something bigger the football .
5390,"i do n't think so hah a , think it 's just the same last name . but i think this chopin is the one producing them movie ' tom vs . time ' , brady certainly ha beaten father tim do far ."
5391,yeah 40 and winning the super bowl is no small achievement . apparently the fans have a freed in bill we trust ' !
5392,"ahah it makes sense , patriots fans are delved . although it 's nothing compared to them love for brady , fans love belichick but brady is basically the messier ."
5393,"what ! well i guess that 's what you call hell bound fans , lol ! so what is this like his 5th or 6th upper bowl ring . i hear even now he 's played to win te next super bowl ."
5394,"i think so goo ! although some people are worried about what 's going to happnbe to him after i career . bob ryan said something about the book being creepy , liek football is going to the rover his ; life even after he retires ."
5395,yeah what the said was that it would curtis . at 's nothing i want to dabble in . i think he 's a great player .
5396,"oh definitely , plus it 's not surprising how much he 's revered , maybe it 's a new england thing . have you heard of benjarvus greenellis ?"
5397,yeah he 's z homer patriot player right ?
5398,"he is ! and one thing he got recognition for was never fumbling the ball throughout his career r , i wonder if he ever got an award for it ."
5399,if not he should have . did you know that the iowa state visiting locker room is painted pink . i wonder why ?
5400,"i 'm guessing it 's too intimidate visitors ? although by this point i doubt people are still surprised by it , so i do n't think it 's effective ."
5401,yeah i 'm sure your right . can you believe top bowlers made more than top nfl players in the 60 's ?
5402,"did they really ? that 's shocking , i wonder why , maybe people di n't care about football as much back then . also i 'm sure bowling games have more than 11 minutes of game play ."
5403,that 's unbelievable . almost as much as espn winning an emmy . do you know what for ?
5404,"i think it was for creating the first down line ! i guess it shows more people care about footbal snow . anyways , was nice talking to yu , have a good day !"
5405,hi ware you a football fan ?
5406,"yep , how bout you"
5407,yeah i do n't get to watch it much anymore though . i hear bowlers and to make more than top nfl players in the 60 's
5408,thats amazing to learn . i think that has changed just a little .
5409,yeah as for tom brady he swear by avocado ice cream .
5410,i think i read that somewhere . in ever actually tried it though . is it good .
5411,"i ca n't imagine . . . but i guess if you add enough sugar i it , haah ! he makes it tbs method ."
5412,lol . to each his or i guess . maybe i will try it out .
5413,i do lie avocado . it 's amazing to thin tthat those bowlers made twice as much as top performs .
5414,yeah i have never been much of a bowler . my uncle bowled a perfect game though . he ia pretyy good .
5415,wow that 's awesome . i got a turkey once . he patriot produced a rb at never fumbled the ball in his entire career .
5416,yeah his name was benjarvis rene ellis
5417,yeah that 's right . that 's quite a accomplishment . kind of like the college game that scored 2200
5418,"yeah that is a lot of scoring . i think i wold have called benjarvis , double double . cause diode has two first names andc wo last name . lol ."
5419,"i know make a choice parady . georgia tech was ot playing around with cumberland , i would not have wanted to be on that bus ride home ."
5420,me either . bet they avoided playing them foray while .
5421,did you hear about the emmy that espn won ?
5422,yeah for the yellow first down line . genius in my opinion .
5423,mine too male it a lot easier . you know there no written rule that keeps women from playing in the nfl ?
5424,i think it ' a more the status quo of hte sport that keeps them out . maybe they could be kicker or punter .
5425,yeah i do n't discriminate but u do think it 's just habit to think of football as a malexonly sport
5426,i totally agree with you there . well im gon na have to get off here good chat . it l .
5427,"how 's it going , are you a football fan ; tom brady recently releases his best selling tbs method"
5428,"i do n't really know such but football , or tom brady . what is this book of his ?"
5429,it 's a book that details brady 's diet nd training regiment shih he credits with being able to still play football at 40
5430,that sounds like an impressive achievement ! is it a popular book ? is it for people like me ad you ?
5431,"it 's popular with a lot of people , i guess a lot of people view it ad a mix of sports and religion"
5432,"i guess tom has followers then , like a religious leader ."
5433,yea i guess boston fans see the patriots as a religion and tom brady as an apos6le of the team
5434,then the team must have other apostles ? or other religious figures ?
5435,they do have a slow n ' in bill wet rust ' that refers to teh patriots ' coach
5436,i guess it sounds like a religion . or a cult . the book must be a best seller . people follow teh guidance in th ebook ? make it part of their lives ?
5437,well tom brady does and a lot of his teammates l i guess most non athletes who read it are just fans
5438,how many copies has it sold ? it ca n't nearly so many as the bible .
5439,i 'm not sure but some people think brady is only motivated by moeny
5440,he probably has a lot of money as a football star . i wonder how much he can make from a book .
5441,hmm i dont now . i guess he could always try another sport after football . the top bowlers in the 1960s mad memory hat the top football stars
5442,"that was probably the golden age of bowling . many leagues formed , and people tried the sport . probably not ever going to be as popular again ."
5443,"well brady could become an engineer , hte average engineer makes more than af football player in their lifetime"
5444,thats sound like a plan . the world can always tune more engineers .
5445,yea football players do make a lot of money for only 11 mins of actual gameplay
5446,they do get paid for standing round a lot . i guess they feel that they have worked hard to get there .
5447,"well i hot toga o , nice talking with you"
5448,do you like football ?
5449,"ca n't say i 'm a fan , i could tell you some basic well know facts , but not much else ."
5450,"same , i also only have a passing knowledge in football ."
5451,"tom brady i 've heard of , very accomplished and successful . i guess he 's branching out from football ."
5452,well h eis considered among th best quarterbacks in history
5453,maybe it will be worth my time buying his new book and watching his show then .
5454,what is his new book ?
5455,"the tbs method . some kids of athletes bible , tells you how to bey wealthy , physically and spiritually ."
5456,by spiritually does he mean the mental component ?
5457,"no , he 's starting to conflpate sport with religion , i dont really get it myself . probably just a gimmick to sell some books ."
5458,"in any case , k think he is quite the exert in regards to healthy dnc the physical body given his achievements"
5459,you ca n't deny his achievements . often these books are not even written by the person they ate supposed to be done by . a goat writers does the work and a famous person adds tshirt new to the cover .
5460,"i can see how that could be true , but without proof , i do n't want to diminish a persons efforts"
5461,"it 's kind of na open secret , there 's alway sa clue in hte legal age at the front . will you be watching his documentary tim vs time ?"
5462,probably not . will you ?
5463,"i barely watch t anymore , the kids usually have access to it . most of my evening lisa lso taken up pricing kids to their various sporting activities , not football though ."
5464,well perhaps you can find a story version tha only show 'the live gameplay . each one is only a dozen or so minutes lone of real gameplay
5465,"that 's another treason why i do n't watch footbal . , three hours in front of the television for just 12 minutes of actual action . i could just grab my bible instead ."
5466,do ou read from the bible often ?
5467,not really . i 'm some times curious the i hear people quote from it . i used to have to do it in school when i was a kid .
5468,"i agree . in any case , thanks for chatting ."
5469,hi how are you today ?
5470,i am goof how about you ?
5471,i am good . do you like football ?
5472,yes . packers fan
5473,"i , ike football but not enough to think that tom brady wrote the athlete bible ya know ."
5474,i am not a patriots fan or a fan of brady
5475,i do n't understand why the nfl has been using tracking chip so the players shoulder pads .
5476,they track everything today by tech looking for an edge
5477,"yeah , it definitley seems that way"
5478,they even ave them in footballs now
5479,"that is crazy . like , everything in the world one n't need tracking , at least in my opinion ."
5480,dyes its getting nuts . tracking velocity and even rotation
5481,ep
5482,they aww even using a lot of tech in baseball these days
5483,the cell industry is definitely taking over the world .
5484,i totally agree with you on that
5485,are you religious ?
5486,yes . fairly so
5487,did you know that thomas jefferson had created his own version of the bible so he could remove the supernatural parts . thats wild .
5488,no . i didnt . that is wild
5489,"yes , definitely , a nd also the biblical tower of babel is based on a real building in present day iraq ."
5490,yes . i had read that before
5491,its ben nice talking to u
5492,"tom bad is a great player and a football leaned , do you agree ?"
5493,i agree loved his as vs tom documentary . have you seen it ?
5494,"i did , i as loved it l football has become like a religion to brady , i have to agree on that"
5495,yes . did you read his book ' the tbs method ' ?
5496,"no , i didnt read that one , did you we it ?"
5497,i have n't read it . he credits it though witht align him to stay at the top of his name .
5498,"i might pick that book up sounds interesting , maybe i can learn a thing or two from it , he must have a lot of healthy habits , success like that isnt achieved without discipline"
5499,true . did you know that the university of iowa 's visiting players locker room mis painted pink ? i wonder why they did that ?
5500,"sounds really funny lol , i wonder why they did that as well did i also wonder the faces of the visiting players , it must be confusing"
5501,lil right ? in the 1960 's it paid more to be a bowler than an nfl player . bowler 's made twice as much has the top football stars from back then .
5502,"oh i see , thats odd considering how much money football players make"
5503,yes . another suprising money fact is that the lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than teh lifetime earnings of an nfl or mlb player .
5504,"engineers also make a lot of money , they work for more years so it does make sense"
5505,i agree . he highest scoring football game eve nwa when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 in 1916 !
5506,"that must have been a boring game , 222 points of difference ! ! ! i bet the other team was playing a totally different sport"
5507,lol yes ! former rb benajrvus greenellis never fumbled the ball once during his career . that 's amazing .
5508,"that is amazing , i bet he is one of the few players with that impressive record"
5509,probably . i would imagine . do you ever read the bible ?
5510,"no not really , i dont believe in god , but i guess many people enjoy reading in , do you read it ?"
5511,not really . i find it interesting that i'ts the highest selling book of all time with over 5 billion copies sold !
5512,"theres a lot of religious people around the world and ts also one of the oldest books ,"
5513,hi ! are you familiar with tom brady ? i 'm very interested in following his tbs method aka the athlete 's bible !
5514,hey ! i 'm good . how is your day ? not relaly . what is it about ?
5515,"to tom brady , f football is basically a religion end at age 40 , he likes to credit that lifestyle brand with benign in such great shape ; pe . it 's worth checking out ! are you a football fan at all ?"
5516,"i watch football , not a lot actually . i like hockey . 'll heck it out for sure . i know him , but not really familiar with tbs method you mentioned . have you already tried or just planning to follow ?"
5517,"i plan to follow one day . not just for health but to get em through the nfl offseason since the regular season only lasts 17 weeks , which is for too short for a die hard ans . ha 21"
5518,"honesty i 've never been able to understand why ties i just 17 weeks . if it was regular and at least 67 months , i 'll probably follow more regularly lol are you fan of any team ?"
5519,"i like the lego in general . i like the saints but i do n't like that silly , misogynistic rule they have in place that forbids cheerleaders and players from making in the same restaurant . i 'm surprised n lawsuits have been filed of that one yet !"
5520,di you know that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of ive gameplay . it sounds so surprising and difficult to believe ! ! !
5521,"i know , right ? commercials drag it out to make it seem wonder , i suppose . with that and knowing there ar no rules against women playing , i 'm surprised we have n't hada t least a female kicker drafted yet ! especially in this day and age !"
5522,i 'm wondering about female players . what kind of eligibility requirements do they have ? any idea ? because still we do n't see any female players .
5523,"ish honestly do n't know but perhaps we 'll see one someday soon ! although if a female running back like very drafted , she 'll have a difficult time if she wanted to compete with benjarvus greenellis who 's never fumbled the football ish his entire pro career r !"
5524,"true ! i also read that the average lifetime earnings of an beginner is higher than an nfl player . it 's actually ok , but i was sure they make a lot of money ."
5525,yah that surprises me ! the people who creates the tracking chips for shoulder pads and football 's make more than the actual players themselves ! ahh !
5526,"i 'm so you are right . this industry has a lot of cash . it looks like players are n't people , the take major part fo treat . bad fir them ! ! !"
5527,"agreed . heck , end in the 1960s , the top bowlers made twice as much thant he top footbal players . that is just downright sad ."
5528,"really ? ha . . . that 's interesting . the have changed drastically after hat ? nfl has some stranger yes . for example , new orleans cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl players . it looks likes tzu ; id rule . any idea why ? i do n't see any meaning"
5529,i know and it sounds like discrimination to be completely honest . what i also think is silly is georgia tech actually beat a team 2020 once back in 1916 . it 's the highest score jet in a football game . that must sounds humiliating .
5530,i can not imagine ethics score nad how game was . absolutely no . i 'm sure players of lost tea remembered t for long time . . .
5531,"perhaps if georgia tech 's locker room was pink like the locker room at the university of iowa , maybe the score would have been different . haha then again it probably would have angered them even more ."
5532,good joke ! i also read about pink color of dressing room . what do they expect should happen ? do they believe it my change how competitors play ? lol
5533,"hazy ! to me k it seems like it would further anger a team with is the last thing i 'd wan na do ! well it was great chatting wit hyou ! i 'm on go eat an apple . speaking of which , the fruit itself only became known as na apple after the bible was translated into latin . malus actually means both evil nad apple . ha ! have a great day !"
5534,"howdy , how 's it going ?"
5535,"its going great , how bout yourself"
5536,i am fine . do you read the book the bible ?
5537,i have read parts of it . i dont read it very often and i have never read it word for was d .
5538,i think that it is a very popular book . many people have read it and tried to understand its secrets .
5539,i dont kow . i dont always take 8th really literally . i mainly use it as a good set of rules to live by to be a good person .
5540,that is a good guide . there are many lessons buried deep within the scriptures that are hard to fathom . i is a good guide to look to one 's conscience .
5541,yeah stats so true . did you know that the bible as sod over 5 billion copies . i wonder who has the copyright on it ? .
5542,i do n't know . i guess the money must go to someones who uses it to help eh church .
5543,yeah that was kind f a one . maybe it was in te wrong did . lol . sorry .
5544,"i understand . the copyright om th edible is of course eli by a higher power , one no tbehuolden to man 's laws . it was a funny joke . i did not see , but now i do . thank you ."
5545,"so i wonder if the companies who print n sell the bible , e , feel the game about that o it they make more they make a profit off of i t ."
5546,they can not profit end remain pure in the eyes of the one who wrote it . the would do well to consider the content of the very book that they print .
5547,yeah . i think you have a little more faith in humanity than i do .
5548,"possibly . the bible has been used by many people for and things , not all of the good . the book is not the variety ."
5549,that is true . many people have been persecuted in the name of god and the label .
5550,"the bible is bu tone book off any . truth can be unearthed outside of books . the world holds many secrets , but you probably have the most inside of lou ."
5551,"well aid . i just try to be a good person everyday . i believe it god . i even live in the bible . i just know that it has be rewritten o many times that who knows exactly that was said in the original . i think the overall message i that is important , and i dont think that has changed ."
5552,"the original i not the guest , nor is the newest the arrest . you will know the guest from your own understanding of truth . have a good evening , and may you studies take you forward ."
5553,thank you . i shame been a great conversation . hope you have a good one as well .
5554,thank you .
5555,bye
5556,hey ! do you enjoy football
5557,"i do , i think its a greats port and i am a big fan , do you like it ?"
5558,"yeah i do , i love watching the playoffs ."
5559,"me too k , do you have a favorite team ?"
5560,"i like the patriots , what about you ?"
5561,"i like the patriots too , i lie in new england nd i also like winning team lol ."
5562,"that is cool . brady said his book ' athletes bible ' has really helped hi , stay at hte top of his game at age 40 ."
5563,"i hear he loves avocado icecream , not sure if i like it , theres a lot of flavors better that that one"
5564,ew ! i do n't even ike avocado .
5565,"i know right , icecream malus avocado doesnt seem like a very god combination , but it does the trick for brady so thank god for avocado icecream lol"
5566,haha yeah ! a former patriot running back benjarvus greenellis has never once fumbled the footbal in his career !
5567,"thats crazy , the level of skill that guy had , not fumbling a ball and being a rb , thats a hard thing to accomplish"
5568,definitely . they locker room in the university of iowa is painted pink for visiting football teams .
5569,"taht really funny , i bet thats how you win 2220 intimidating the other team"
5570,i just it would work . can you believe top bowlers made twice as much as football layers in 1960 ? t hat is insane ! you never hear about professional bowling anymore .
5571,its not as popular as it used to be or maybe its because football is a lot more popular than back then
5572,"yea probably . at least the technology has come a long way , the nfl uses tracking chips in the footballs and teh player 's shoulder pads ."
5573,"i heard about that , must be pretty expensive there are 32 teams and a lot of players so rooster ."
5574,alot including all the balls they probably go through . i ca n't believe an average game is only 11 minutes !
5575,"that seems like an unreal stat , a game lasts or 2 to 3 hours each quarter 15 minute without cds ,"
5576,"pparetnly it 's calculated on live gameplay , who know ? haha . i was greats tale , king to you1 ut i have to get dinner now . bye !"
5577,"hello , are you particularly interested in football ?"
5578,sure ! it kind it 's interesting that the nfl has no rule against female players .
5579,"yeah i do too ! especially because they seem sexist , the way cheerleaders have to leave if football players were there first ."
5580,the nfl uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads to record a ; layers moves on the field . mays trey could track players off the field and avoid these situations .
5581,"that 's a good point ! they definitely could come up with some technological innovation , like the first down line e , that was absolutely innovative ."
5582,engineers some up with that ! probably a better profession for women to choose . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than teh average lifetime earnings of an nfl ; player .
5583,i wonder why that is ! maybe because engineers have to work longer ? after all football games only have about 11 minutes of live game play .
5584,"true , but there is little risk of concussion as an engineer ."
5585,that 's true . maybe another reason could be teh country has n't alway needed or loved football . i think in the us the top bowlers made more than top footbal players .
5586,"bowlers were lucky . it was a golden car of the sport , never to return again ."
5587,"yeah i agree , plus i think football records are objectively more interesting . like have you ever heard o benjarvus greenellis ?"
5588,i think he 's the guy who never fumbled a football . quite a feat ! he should yet a bonus or a pair for that .
5589,"exactly ! i think eh should get soemthing . after all spun tolt an award for creating the first down line , and i think that 's similar in terms of impressivsness ."
5590,do you know much about the bible ?
5591,"i do n't know too much ! i think a lot of religious texts are similar , like the old testament overlaps with the hebrew bible and she greek sep6uagint ."
5592,"very true . did you know that for 1963 , it was not uncommon for americans students to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education ?"
5593,"i did not ! but it makes sense , we 've really made it such a huge part of american culture . i think teddy roosevelt is one of the only presidents not tos wear in using the bible ."
5594,same with me adams . i think they swore o nthe constitution . they felt that htey owed allegiance to the people and the government first .
5595,"ahh that 's a nice way to see it . on the other hand thomas jefferson found middle ground , i think he used a razor to cut out parts of hte buble to use his own version ."
5596,he wanted to see religion nine humanity terms . he was a practical guy .
5597,"ahh that makes one . well it was nice talking to you , have a good day !"
5598,hey do you like the nfl ? crazy that they have 32 different teams
5599,i do enjoy the nfl . i 'm a bears fan myself .
5600,"ha ya i pike the patriots myself , did you know that tom brady came pun with a book recently ?"
5601,i did not . what is it about ?
5602,"ya its a about his tips for success in life , it sa best selling ' athlete 's bible '"
5603,"i will have to look into that . i had no idea . speaking of the patriots , did you know that the had a rb who never fumbled a football ? !"
5604,"i did know about tha t , i think his name was benjarvus right ? he does n't play fort hem anymore but he was awesome !"
5605,"yes , benjarvus greenellis . he ended his career with 0 fumble see did you know that in the 1960 's top bowlers made more than for football players ? !"
5606,"wow thats impressive ! i do know that an engineer will earn more money over their life than an nfl player , rich is crazy , but nfl players only play for limited years"
5607,i did not know that . you 'd think more people would aspire to be engineers then . that 's a lot of money and certainly much easier on your body than sports .
5608,"yup i agree , you do n't have to wear tracking chips either tht track your movements hands peed omen the field"
5609,i did hear that players wear tracking chips in their shoulder pads and they have them in th all . do yo know for a purpose ?
5610,"yes it tracks their location , velocity , and things like the ball rotation , i hope they use it to help prevent injuries"
5611,i hope so too . do you know why they do n't use it to help make calls on teh field when they are in question ? it seems like they should .
5612,"ya i do n't know , they should use that stuff imo , would you ever be a cheerleader for the saints btw ?"
5613,"no , i think i 've probably missed that boa tha ha ."
5614,"haha well the saints do n't treat their cheerleaders we i think , they cna't go to restaurants with players"
5615,"i did hear about hat . worse still l if teh cheerelazder was thereof best and a player enters , thy hav veto stop eating a leave . that 's ridiculous and very upsetting ."
5616,"yu i agree , would you ever watch a football gamer with woman playng though ? do you think that lol ever happen ?"
5617,i would . i think they should start their own league that 's not exploitation like the lingerie bowl .
5618,"haah ya i agree , i think we coul dave a female kicker , theres no rule against it"
5619,"hi there , d o you watch the nfl l ?"
5620,"i love watching the nfl , how about you ?"
5621,yes me too . did you know u of iowa painted otehr visitor locker room pink ?
5622,"yes i do , i live down the street from the stadium ! new been to a game there ?"
5623,oh time . no i have not been there . did you iknow thye spew on and emmy once ?
5624,"i heard that before , what was it for ? something about yellow right ?"
5625,year they invented the superimposed yellow line
5626,wow did not know that ! do you ever watch college football ? the record for the highest score was 2220 !
5627,yeah that was something when georgia tech beat cumberland back in 1916
5628,"yes it was , imagine being on cumberland , i would have quit !"
5629,yeah pretty bad defeat for sure . did ou know women can play in the nfl ?
5630,"i did not know that , do you think men can play in the wnba ?"
5631,i do not know about the rules but it would be fair that they play too i guess . did you hear about tracking chips and the players now ?
5632,i have heard . they are made probably by engineers hat will and more money than the players who wear them will
5633,"yeah , i would not be surprised . they take everything though from velocity to location and everythings in between"
5634,"i bet they do , do you ever watch espn ?"
5635,"i do from time to tie ; on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
5636,"i know the big will , how about you ?"
5637,"oh cool . i only kno awsome facts like , it has sold over 5 billion copied"
5638,that is crazy o think . he gets the money i wonder ?
5639,i have no idea but old about an influential cook .
5640,"hello , do you watch then fl ?"
5641,"yes , i do . my favorite team is the patriots and i love brady . how about you ?"
5642,"nice , same here . did you know he wrote a book now as well ?"
5643,yah the athletes bible . also there is a documentary serious tht he is in called time vs tom
5644,yeah i am looking forward to seeing the . do you know that is favorite ice cream flavor is ?
5645,"yeah i is avocado , i guess eating healthy has kept him i shape even at his age ."
5646,yes exactly . id you know women can play in the nfl ?
5647,teh they have to meet the requirements but sill pretty lol .
5648,yeah . did you know engineers make more than football players over their lifetime ?
5649,i think that makes dense since football players have a pretty short career and engineers have a longer one
5650,yeah exactly . do you know that 'the highest score in college football is ?
5651,"yes , that was georgia tech versus cumberland where they beat them 2220"
5652,yes that a game . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
5653,"oh haha they won it for the superimposed yellow line , right '"
5654,theres he did . i am thankful because it makes watching the game from home much easier
5655,me too . did you hear about nfl using tracking chips on their players now in the field ?
5656,i did actually they are measuring a bunch hof stuff lke rotation and velocity and all that .
5657,yes exactly . i really hope they can somehow use that data to make the game a bit safer and les concussions
5658,i hope so too . did you hear about that weird rule the new orleans cheerleaders ahve to endured ?
5659,yeah about not being able to eat in the same restaurant as the players . what is up with that ?
5660,i do not know why it is there still but i the they get rid of it soon . it was nice chatting with you .
5661,"hello , ar you a football fan ?"
5662,"yes , it 's a great sport ! the whole world loves it !"
5663,who of the 32 teams car your favorite
5664,i don ot like to choose . which one is good 's team ? is there one team more spiritual than all the rest ?
5665,god likes thee things i think or university of iowa since iowa is gods country
5666,iowa . it sounds biblical . i gues she vikings are a good choice for a christian god .
5667,i agree . did you know iowa painted their visitor locker room pink .
5668,that is for breast cancer awareness . the folks in iowa know that others new to learn the risk of breast cancer in football players .
5669,"that was not the reason , burt a good guess . it is . deal with psyching the other team out an calming them down ."
5670,"it could have had a double purpose : soften the team for the game , and make them deceptive to an important message bout breast cancer ."
5671,"that i sa great point , have you been affected by it ?"
5672,i here not been affected by teh pink looker room . it has kept me calm but not passive .
5673,"i meant beast cancer , lol q did you know woman could p , ay in the nfl if they wanted to and could play ."
5674,they could possibly feel more comfortable in a pink locker room
5675,"i agree , lol ! did you know also theres saints cheerleaders need to have a restaurant to the players come in , kind of sexist !"
5676,that 's a blown opportunity to take cancer awareness among the players and cheerleaders .
5677,"for sure , i like your take on breast teacher awareness ! now only i atom brady could be an advocate !"
5678,he is half way there . he is an avocado . i think he could be brought to the us .
5679,"lol , he should write it in his athletes bible"
5680,it would be a good step in the right direction for him . he has the power and the influence .
5681,for sure ! good chatting with you !
5682,tom brady is a wonderful player . he was played for newer england patriots .
5683,i mess if you are a patriots fan you ca coal him wonderful . u am certainly no too of those lol .
5684,the nfl is the major profession football plagues in north america .
5685,i know that . i was hit every week . how about you ?
5686,the nfl regular season runs from september to december . which is your favourite team ?
5687,i am a die hard steelers fan . sick i was old enough to watch . how about you ?
5688,"chicago bears , i am great fan of it ."
5689,really i have never heard it put so elegant . lol
5690,nfl has no written rule against female players women woul din fact be allowed to met the eligibility criteria .
5691,i 'm not sure if it will ever happen . i would try about my daughter playing footbal .
5692,"nfl uses tracking chips in th shoulder pads t record move of the players in the field and try to improve the game of the us , layer ."
5693,really . so thats how they get all those interesting stay . i didnt know that .
5694,"the revenue for the player is veto high compared to otehr sports so allot he 5eamatesw a to win the trophy for the team ,"
5695,i know the average engineer actually male more over a lifetime than an nfl player . thats crazy . me
5696,it is very interesting .
5697,it is . another interesting fact . the average nfl game only has 1 minutes of live gameplay .
5698,the iowa 's locker room for football team is completely painted pink .
5699,wonder if that effects the opposing team at lab .
5700,biblical tower of babel was likely based on a real building in modern iraq .
5701,that makes nl sense unless they were looking into the future when they wrote the bible .
5702,bible is the product of divine inspiration which define the relationship between god nad human .
5703,yeah did you know most presidents swear in on the bible .
5704,two us president did not use it in swearingin ceremonies .
5705,yeah they are johns quincy adams and teddy roosevelt
5706,its correct .
5707,well i got to be going ttyl .
5708,"hi , there . do you know much about the bible ?"
5709,"i do , actually ! it 's one of the most influential and best selling books of al time with over 5 billion copies sold . that about you ?"
5710,"i know a little . jim you know that before 1963 , it was ot uncommon for american students to read from the bible as part of their elementary education ?"
5711,really ? wow ! that is very surprising ! almost a surprising as the only two presients who did n't use a bible at heir swearing in ceremonies were adams and roosevelt !
5712,oi think they swore on the constitution . they felt they should be loyal to the law of the land an they people .
5713,exaclty . andre oven jefferson created his own version by cutting out the supernatural parts sad o you think they call that teh ? king jefferson ' version ? ha !
5714,"yeah , that woul day a good name . lol he wanted to see religion in humanity seems ."
5715,i also did n't know that the etemenanki in iraq was what they based the tower of babel on in the bible . that 's pretty cool !
5716,i would imagine that many things in the bible have some basis in fact . it might be hard to detect because the language has changed .
5717,"true . and speaking of the language , i found out recently the word apple came about wen th edible was translated to latin because malus mean evil and apple ."
5718,that is an interesting coincidence . i guess that would be what eve actually ate ' evil ' . tasty !
5719,"ha ! well speaking of bibles , ace you1 familiar with the three 's bibles . the tbs method tmz brady follows to stay at the top of his game ?"
5720,"no , i 'm not . i do n't know much about it or tom brady ."
5721,i understand . do you follow then fl at all ? i do and it 's crazy to think that heat average gram eis only 11 minutes long in terms of live gameplay !
5722,that 's not much for a 3 hour affair . still a pretty risky way to make money . teh average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than he average lifetime earnings of an nfl player .
5723,"thats crazy because back . in the 1960s , the top football players made nlcs than the top bowlers . they made twice as much as a matter of fact . kind of sad , really ."
5724,i guess bowling was the big sport the . probably sponsors and tv helped them earn money .
5725,true . on a related noe m i ca n't believe we have n't had any females signed yet considering tenure hard no rules against women playing as long as they meet the eligibility requirements .
5726,it certainly would make gameplay different . even though an average nfl game only has 12 minutes of live gameplay !
5727,"true . but if the saints very drafted a woman player , i wonder if that silly misogynisg yule that forbids cheerleaders from eating in the same restaurant as hte football players would apply to female football players ?"
5728,"i wonder as well . the league has a lot of attitude that it needs to change . anyway , thanks for the chat !"
5729,"agree . i mean , the regular season is long 17 weeks long from september to december , hat gives them plenty of time to make the necessary changes outside of th regular season . well it was great chatting with you !"
5730,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
5731,"i sure do . my favorite is tom brady and the patriots , and you ?"
5732,the guy is the man . can you guess is favorite icy cream kind ?
5733,i think it is avocado oi djt know ? i mean 9th makes sends
5734,"it sure does , the guy is very health conscious and watches what he eats"
5735,true story . did you hear about his book ?
5736,yes the athlete 's bible . i read it and it is amazing . have you read it ?
5737,i have not but i will ive it a go . i also want to watch the tom vs time series
5738,yeah that sounds pretty cool too . did you know women can play in teh nfl ?
5739,yes as long as they meet the requirements handm fake the cut for it
5740,yes . did you know engineers make more money than football players are their lifetime
5741,yeah i guess it makes sense since their careers are longer and they have more opportunities to make money
5742,good point actually . they are also using tracking chips on the players now .
5743,"right , they are collecting all his info on velocity and rotation and such . wonder what the use it for"
5744,hope they can make some sense of it and use it to make the gmail safer for the players
5745,"i hope so the . on another topic , do you know anything about the bible ?"
5746,i do actually . i know that is has sold over 5 billion copies now
5747,that is a lot of books . i guess hat is why is ne of the most influential books in histoy
5748,right ? it is pretty amazing . jefferson created his own version of it
5749,"yes , heard he cut out the supernatural parts off of it with a razor"
5750,he mush ave really not believe in all that stuff .
5751,"hi there , do you watch he nfl ?"
5752,the nfl ? th national football league ? i that thing go broke or get offshored to china or something ?
5753,nope still around . do you know how many teams are in ut ?
5754,i think every year or two they add a team or two . it must be up to about 50 . how many are there ?
5755,currently it is fitting at 32 teams and the season lasts for 17 weeks
5756,17 weeks . i guess that a good length . is that every year though ? football is a good game . i ' glad it is still around .
5757,yeah ever year and then it is topped with the superbowl . did you know bowlers used to make more than football payers in teh 60s ?
5758,i guess the football players chose the wrong sport then . they could have just gone bowling and make money . they could wear their helmet bowling too .
5759,well things haven changed now so that definitey is no the case . but engineers still make more than football players
5760,"engineers makes more than football players , but not for playing football . engineers are good ate engineering g ."
5761,yup for sure . did you know when can play too if they qualify ?
5762,qualify ? is there a written exam and a road test ours something ?
5763,well there biz the physical exam that all players have to pass in order to play to gesture they cant fake tone game
5764,"i guess there could be some women that could try out for a team , but i ca n't say i know if they 'd make it ."
5765,well i hope e get to see them in the field for sure . do you know who benajrvus grwe3nelli sis ?
5766,he 's the guy that fumbled every ball he ever touched .
5767,yeah what a career or him . did you know nfl is using racking lips on the players now ?
5768,rye nfl jos singing tracking chips ? i did not know that .
5769,"opps typo , they are using tracking chips to track velocity and rotation and such . i hope they can use those to make the game safer too ."
5770,"for the fans , at least . they , know when a player might suddenly come flying at them . fan safety is a priority . well , it should be . good for the nfl and the singer chips ."
5771,i guess . nice chatting with you .
5772,what are your thoughts on brady ?
5773,"well , i live in new england not far from fosboro so i am a fan . although , i am not really a football fan"
5774,"i see , wel im not a big fan either but do think brady is a really skilled player ,"
5775,"he is dedicate to the game , thats ' for sure . i wonder how many seasons more he will be able to playing still be great ."
5776,"i bet he follows a whole ritual eh is 40 years old and has a lot more games in font lol him , usually players retire at taht age or even earlier"
5777,"i think he has had a lot of injuries and concussions but i suppose he just does n't want to give up . it 's his whole life , apparently ."
5778,"and then theres also the brain damage associated with football , he already has a lot of money and ahs done about everything a player can do , h eis a leyend that is a sure thing"
5779,maybe he will surprise everyone a retire next year . i think his wife would like that . eh will till be making a ton of money on endorsements .
5780,"he doesnt need to play football in odder to wi na lot of money , eh also makes money from his books and he can keep on writting others , i bet people will buy them"
5781,"i am sure they ware best sellers . he could be a coach too . i would not want to push myself to the point where my injuries would destroy the quality , my life ."
5782,"i agree , retire when you can besides he nasa already won everything , he ks a hall of famer and considered way the best player in the nfl history , wat least by amy"
5783,i dont ' think anyone will ever break his record . although it will give z lo tofu players something to try do . i would like to see a woman meet the eligibility requirements . that would be interesting !
5784,"it would be interesting i agree with you , but it does seem unlikely to happen"
5785,"i do n't know what they would do about the locker room . they would hae to have a separate one , maybe . i do n't think it will ever happen either ."
5786,"thats a logistics problem , but i think its the last of ther worries lol , football players are really strong a tackle must hurt al ot , even break a bone or two"
5787,"yes those piles tey end up in must be damaging , especially if you are on the bottom . most women have smaller bones tan men . . would be a recipe for disaster ."
5788,"a recipe for disaster that is a huge thing , i would like tow at that ,"
5789,"i your not want to see it ! maybe taht 's why no woman has met the requirements ! although , there is only 11 minutes worth of live play in a game ."
5790,"only 11 minutes ? wow , it does seem like a lot longer tha tthat"
5791,that 's the coaches trying to figure out what happened and the adslol
5792,but only 11 minutes ? thats a hard thing to believe are you sure you have th exact right ?
5793,"hell , do you watch the nfl ?"
5794,"hi there , yes i do . do you have a favorite team or player ?"
5795,"actually yes , i like brady a lot and you ?"
5796,nice same here . do you know what hs favorite ice cream flavor is ?
5797,yes it is avocado and i am not surprised the guy is very health conscious
5798,yes exactly . he wrote a book also so he is an author rags well now
5799,"yes he wrote the athletes bible , the 1912 method . i ahve yet to read it though"
5800,yeah me too and i am curious to watch the documentary series tom vs . time . have you seen that .
5801,"i have not but will , he an eye on that . did you know u of iowa painted their locker room for the visitors ?"
5802,i wonder what effect that has though really . do you know that 'the highest score in game college football is ?
5803,yes btw as 2220 and georgia tech totally crushed cumberland
5804,yeah what a game that must have been . did you hear about nfl using tracking chip son the players now ?
5805,yes they are tracking all sports of stuff now like velocity and rotation and such
5806,yeah exactly i hops they can hs those stats to make the game safer too
5807,i hope so too . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
5808,yea be used to play for patriots and never fumbled the ball in his career
5809,yeah what a career . di you hear bout that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
5810,that is so weird . i hope it goes away soon . the worst part is that they have to leave mid meal too
5811,yah that has to go . do you know much about the bible ?
5812,i know that it has sold 5 billion cope sand is one o 'the most ifnluentia books in history
5813,yeah that is true and it was part of the education system until 1963 .
5814,hi how are you today ? do you like football ?
5815,yes ! it is a very popular sport around teh world ! some of his male and female athletes in the world play football .
5816,tom brady has show on facebook watch . its interesting .
5817,tom brady ? who is he ? what country does he play for ?
5818,the brady is an american foot all player . he played with the money england patriots . do you know who they are ?
5819,there are no many americans thaat play football . he must be quite good . i did n't know that there was a soccer team in new england .
5820,no they are in the united state sat hey are just named for hte new england colonize states .
5821,"tube united states is a very big country , so it should have made soccer teams . the tom brady player is famous for his soccer skills ? has he scored many goals ?"
5822,yes brady is sort of a messier figure for a lot of his fan . he is known for his ruff demeanor and ragamuffin fashion sense .
5823,he sounds like a jesus figure . ? does he have hong hair adn flowing robes ?
5824,lol no he does not . americans are weird the way we show support .
5825,"oh , ok then . 9 guess he 9s not a biblical figure wh e is probably a great athlete who is admired by any . have you heard of the bible ?"
5826,yes and absolutely . do you believe i nthe bible ?
5827,"i understand that it contains many deep and aiding truths , but many more are out that are not known or understood . i think people like tom brady have found those truths l"
5828,i think its probably definately the most sold book of all time .
5829,i fixture the guy who wrote it must have mad real ton of cash on royalties at this point .
5830,well yea i know its always weeb used at the presidential signing in and only 2 times it has been excluded .
5831,"i guess those two times , somebody forgot to bring the bible , or at least the right one . the bible proabably held to be a certain size to have the right amount of power ,"
5832,yes its been good talking to you .
5833,"who , me ? oh , thanks ! that 's very nice of you . stay biblical . take care ."
5834,thanks you too .
5835,are you okay with talking about the bible ?
5836,"yes , i ma happy to talk about the bible . did you know that before 1963 , it wa not uncommon for usa students to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education ?"
5837,"i feel that is a bit forced since people should have the option to learn about any religion they wish . however , it can be essential fo people to learn to help understand the perspectives of other individuals"
5838,"it is important to understand other perspectives . tahoma jefferson creat his own version of the bible , cutting out the 'supernatural ' parts , such as the miracles an the resurrection . he wanted to see religion in humanity terms . that is another perspective worth taking ."
5839,i wonder how much of the bible was even left after the edits
5840,that 's true . other presidents have had a similar view of the bible . presidents teddy rosevelt and joh quincy adams di lot us epa bible at their swearingin ceremonies . i think they swore on the constitution .
5841,i thin that is a very symbolic gesture
5842,"teh bible doest been to have connection to historical fact . the biblical tower of babel was likely based on a real building , the etmeenahki in iraq . i wonder what it looks like ."
5843,i wonder how accurate the events depicted kin the bibles ware or if they are more like constructive stories
5844,"true . the language is quite different , and describes a different times . for example , an apple only became known as an ' apple ' wen the bible was translated into latin in the 4th century . the reason : the word ' malus ' means both apple and evil . that is an interesting coincidence ."
5845,i wonder how much of the meat was lost in transactions of thas bible
5846,it 's a good question . there are 5 billion copies out there . i'ts a popular book .
5847,"even if it is popular , if it was incorrect translated then all 5 billion copies are too . kind of like the game of telephone"
5848,very true . where is he that in it all ? lost in translation . kind of like the tower of babel : incoherence .
5849,"i wonder if the etemenanki is really the biblical tower of babel , the significance that would have ."
5850,"could be . probably evidence in the bible helps , but is sparse ."
5851,do you think the flood happened ?
5852,"the flood could have happened l9claly , but the creation of n arc sounds oddly metaphorical . mount apart dos exist ."
5853,what i mount apart ?
5854,stat is supposedly the place where noah 's ark came to rest after the flood water seceded .
5855,"oh , thanks for explaining . thank you for this intersting discussion ."
5856,are you a tom brady fan ?
5857,"i respect some of his accomplishment and despise some o his tactics . however , i have heard about the chips tseries about him"
5858,i did to i havne't seen it though . have you ? apparently he has a plan for how life taht involves avocado ice cream .
5859,he and his wife both eat healthy and exercise . his ' bible ' is for athletes and his lifestyle is productive do them .
5860,yeah i just ca n't get behind terms like messier and in bill will thrus . i do think he is a great quarterback though enough to be spoken about with some of the greats .
5861,"no doubts . he has won 6 super bowls . even though he and his coach have been caught cheating , it is still a great accomplishment . you ca n't argue with ' do your job ' as an approach ."
5862,to funny ! i hear the coach keeps hi mon the injured list even though he is not .
5863,the coach tries to keep the opponents guessing . a writer claims that the brady book i creepy and is cultlike .
5864,now it makes since . i see were the term essay is coming from . it 's amazing to think that bowlers at one time made twice as much as top nfl players .
5865,true . the nfl has done a great job of marketing to increase the value of their product . there are now 32 texas .
5866,divided equally and the nfc and the afc our right .
5867,"thay pals 16 games in a regular season , bu they spread it over 17 weeks to get more revenue ."
5868,well it 's all about the money . do you know what the highest scoring game was ?
5869,"we , l , in college , my team oklahoma beat texas a nad m by 70 . was taht it ?"
5870,no bu tthat is impressive . it was in 1916 and the score was 2200 . can you tell me who ; called ?
5871,probably alabama or clemson .
5872,"georgia tech and cumberland , cumberland lost ."
5873,"i see . you know , one of the other things that th nfl did to make money was to have a lot of teams make the playoffs . a total o off teams make i t ."
5874,wow after each team plays 16 games with one bye week .
5875,"yes . they have a wild card game against the division winner with the worst record , then an 8 team single elimination tournament ending in the super bowl ."
5876,"yes held in the first week off february i ' ; m getting excited and we ti ; l have a real to go , so , you know te average live game only has 11 minutes of real game play ?"
5877,i lke college ball better . if probably has 16 minutes with 40 percent more plays . nice chatting !
5878,hey there do you like tom brady ? i love him i 'm glad he wrote a book
5879,"hey there , i like him too he is a great player . and eh some to like avocado cred cream a lot"
5880,"haha i want to eat hat ! its crazy taht hes ' 40 and still in taht good have , must be the avocado !"
5881,maybe they say it is super healthy . i guess his book is ewing dubbed s the athlete 's bible e .
5882,"yup you 're right , do you watch a lot of football games btw ?"
5883,i doof rom time to time but i am not fully dedicated . how about you ?
5884,"ya i watch the big games and we have parties sometimes , but i do n't really follow a team , i just like teams tha main like the patriots haha"
5885,hahah well good choice there then . do you know about their former qb benjarvus ?
5886,"ya he was a former player r , he even fumbled the ball , he 's the man ! do you know about the highest scoring football game ever"
5887,yeah that was a good day for georgia tech who beat cumberland 2220 .
5888,"yup , imagine how disappointed youd be if you wore a cumberland shirt that day haha , i wish bowlers still made 2x of football players that woudl be fantastic !"
5889,yeah that would b emoji fun . we would all be heading to the dueling alleys . maybe engineering that stil lays more han football
5890,"ya i think they do actually ! over their lifetime anyway , more than nfl and mlb players !"
5891,"yeah , and wel deserved they too . did you know they are using tracking chips on the players now ?"
5892,"i saw that , its only on the need and they use it for stats , but its still scary , i hope they disable the chips off fields"
5893,well they are planted in the shoulders pads so unless they are wearing their uniform outside as well . hope they can get hat to make the game safer too
5894,"ya i agree ! hopefully they do n't track the players off the field either , the saint would probably use it to track the actions of their cheerleaders"
5895,yeah them and that strange rule of theirs . i think it is so unfair that they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant
5896,". i agree , they should probably sue for discrimination , do you know if those rules re the same with other nfl teams ?"
5897,i think they are the only team . what i fin most disturbing s that they have to leave even mid meal if a player walks in
5898,"ya that would be really annoying and a waste of money , how often do you read the bible btw ?"
5899,do you enjoy sports ?
5900,"i love them . especially the nfl . did you hear abut to , brady 's health plan ?"
5901,do you mean his new book ?
5902,yes . ' the tbs method ' . he credits it with help his to stay on top of his game .
5903,i wonder if that is actually a thing or something he made for the book
5904,"i 'm not sure . he had a good documentary called ' tolt s time ' . after i watched it , it changes my view of him . before that i did n't care for him . . . mainly because like he seems to win alot . after watching it though , i realized how much work he puts into his craft end deserves all the credit he gets ."
5905,wht made your opinion of hi change ?
5906,seeing how much mental and physician work tha he puts in during the offseason .
5907,that makes sense . it is amazing how much effort people put in to be the very best
5908,yes . did you kow the biggest scoring game in fooball was in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 22 0 !
5909,either the winning team were tht good or vice versa
5910,yes . lol . n the 1960 top bowlers made twice as much as teh top football stars of taht era .
5911,mama how times have changed
5912,yes . did you know that what outside of te united states soccer is called football in other parts ot he world ?
5913,"yes , that is hey football ad american football confused mere for a tiem"
5914,understandable . former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled in his nfl career . that 's a pretty impressive stat line .
5915,ya . today the nfl even puts chips in players shoulderpwcds and the footballs themselves for data
5916,that 's crazy . lol the average actual gameplay in an nfl game eis only 11 minutes !
5917,ya just there is so much going on in those dozen or so minutes espn even won an emmy for makings the yellow first down line o help the audience digest the information easier
5918,interesting 2 i never knew neat . how man as are there in the nfl ?
5919,"i am not sure of the exact number but i think it is around 30 ? in any case , thanks for chatting ."
5920,did you know that there is a tv series but the ' religion ' of fooball practiced by tom brady .
5921,"that 's crazy . people are really passionate about football , i guess . did you know another patriot player , benajrvus greenellis , never fumbled the ball once in his entire career ?"
5922,that i so rare ! brady and his wife both eat and exercise for optimus life style did performance . they even ear avocado ice cream
5923,that sounds delicious ! i wonder if he 'd ever play football ? did you know women are technically allowed to play in the nfl ?
5924,i suppose we might see a woman kickers ome day . gotham chopin produced the tv series on sad i was talking bout . ' tom ' versus
5925,"nice , i wonder if theyll in an emmys or it . espn won one for the implementation of that superimposed yellow line ."
5926,i love hat line ! the series is so parallel religion that they said ' in bill we trust ' talking about the patriots ' coach .
5927,i think i agree with that columnist from the boston globe who called his following a little cultlike .
5928,"i agree . of course he has delivered more than any coach inch history . do you read any of teh versions of the real bible ? the christian , the jewish or the catholic ?"
5929,"no , i do n't . i probably would be like teddy roosevelt or john quincy adams at my swearing in ceremony ; neither of them used biebers ."
5930,weak re different then . i teach from the christian bible once per was . it is odd that the new testametrn is written in coined greek while jesus and the disciplines spoke dramatic .
5931,have you ever to iraq go see the building in iraq theyd believed was the tower of babel ?
5932,"i have seen photos of it . of course i believe that god divided the people into over 7000 languages there about 100 years after the flood . in mandarin , where words are made by drawing , th word for ship is 3 pictures , a container , a mouth meaning people because only people talk , and the number 8 . there were 8 people on noah 's ark ."
5933,that 's a lot of information ! i just recnelty learned the world apple is only called an apple because of when the bible was translated into latin . malus in latin means both apple nad levi l .
5934,that would be a strange set of translations . am i evil or am i an apple ? thomas jefferson created a unique version of the bible by cutting out all of the supernatural part switch a razor blade .
5935,"wow , things were different back then ! i cna't believe students in the us were required to study th edible in school before 1963 ."
5936,that is awful . i like that bill of rights that state that the government shall not establish a religion . reading the bible in public schools goes to far in tha direction .
5937,"definitely . but in the 60s , bowlers made twice as much money top football players , so the times were very different !"
5938,"yes . you have to respect teh marketing job that the nfl has done to make their product so valuable . of course , better tv pictures developed at the same time ."
5939,"yeah , the technology has changed a bit , too . they now have tracking chips embedded in the shoulder pads and footballs to track the !"
5940,yes . technology makes it better ! nice chat .
5941,are you a football can ?
5942,"yes , i 'm . i like watching nfl games . are you familiar with nfl ?"
5943,"i am . i watch all of them , w old as many as i van anyway . do you have a favorite team ?"
5944,49ers becaue i used to live in san francisco . they belong to the nfl .
5945,thee cars have had their winning streaks but lately they hav fallen on hard times . i am a hawk fans o i see sf twice a year . the only team i do n't have any feelings for are th eat . i do n't like brady or belichick .
5946,why do n't like brady . i thought he was talented . i am not a fan of the pats though .
5947,"he is extremely talented , a is the coach but there have bean too many accusations against them i causes one to wonder . also everyone luke to see s hero fail , unless he 's your hero that is ."
5948,i understand . i heard that brady had a spiritual quest .
5949,why i understand . he looks upon football as a religion in it 's own right . perhaps that ; s why true 's so good at it .
5950,perhaps sr someone suggested that i watch facebook watch about him . do you know what it is ?
5951,i know less than nothing about facebook . i do n't have a account or carpet oh cav son but my kids all have one . it ' how they keep in touch . i wonder what brady has on fb ;
5952,"showing people what is meaningful in his life . i 'm not his fan . so , i might not watch big on the facbook watch ."
5953,"i suppose it is good to see spiritual awareness , i just seem some what odd to look for life 's meaning on a football field ."
5954,true . how many teams are in the nfl league ?
5955,i believe that there are 32 matt he current time . they might not expand again for a long time if ever . i say the ore the terrier . it makes the teams have more parity which would lead to more interestin games .
5956,"i agree with you . but the team owners knight not want more competition . by the way , i heard that teh nfl has no written role against female players ."
5957,they do n't ? boy that would have to be a very tough woman . i wonder if e 'll ever see that ? why not a women 's league for that matter ?
5958,it would be hard for any female candidates to meet the league 's eligibility requirements . i do not think i will see female player joining the nfl in my life time . i 'm old .
5959,"i am also over the hill . i do n't expect otto see women players either . they do hav epa woman ref now though so maybe after we ' r gone they will get ther e , not that i 'm anxious to leave soon ."
5960,"apparently , an average nfl game only ha 11 minutes of live gameplay . i was surprised ."
5961,"so was i but when you stop and think abou tit , it makes sense . moss plays only trade seconds to complete . ther est of the time is ads and huddles ."
5962,you are right . i gues 11 minutes of gameplay makes sense . i 've got to run now . it was sincerely nice chatting with you .
5963,"hello , do you watch the nfl much ?"
5964,"i do , football is one of my favorite games"
5965,nice . me too . did you know women can clay too ?
5966,"i didnt know that fact , the can ? well its a game with alot of contact so it seems a bi unfair for woman"
5967,"sell i woul still b early to see that happen , it might just make the game more interesting"
5968,"coud be , football is a dangerous game , it would make me sick watching a man tackling a woman , theres just too much difference in strength there"
5969,yeah that is a good point . there are only 11 minutes of game play though
5970,"that kid of sucks , tickets tend to be really expensive and the game lasts for 3 hours , you woul expect more than it 11 minutes of gameplay , really unfair ."
5971,yeah i kno wb bowlers used to make more in the 60s than football players
5972,"they did ? i wonder what changed , bowling used to be really popular back in the day , it doesnt seem like a really popular sport now"
5973,leah fooball has really surpassed it now . but engineers still make more money over their lifetime .
5974,"well football players have short careers so it does make a it of snes , engineers also make a lot of money , especially the really good ones"
5975,yes that is true . have you heard of that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
5976,"yeah the really sexist rule ? it sounds really unfair , that rule should e banned and the cheerleaders should sue the team fo what"
5977,i think so too . the forst part in my opinion is the fact that they have to leave mid meal if players walk in
5978,"thats a terrible rule , i lee teh channel it in the nba future , its humiliating actually ,"
5979,"i hope so too . the another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
5980,"the sacred book with the word of god , o course i do , i am really religious , what about you ?"
5981,"oh i see , i am not really bu ti do know the facts bout tone bill , like how it was part of the education system until 1963"
5982,"good thing it 's not part of the current education system . after all , religion is a choice , and not all religions are th sesame"
5983,exactly it totally agree with that . we are free to decide what we choose .
5984,"halo there , do you watch the nfl"
5985,"hello , yes i do . do you know to , brady , the patriots guy ?"
5986,"sure do , he i my favorite player . do you know he is a big author too ?"
5987,yeah the athletes be . i have not and it yet but seems to be making its rounds
5988,yes that and also the documentary series tom has ? time . i want to watch those as well
5989,that should be fun for real . di you know women can play in the nfl ?
5990,yes as long as they meet the requirements . i wonder if any of them have tried
5991,curious but that too . maybe they de sticking to engineering careers
5992,can not blame them l engineers the more over their lifetime
5993,there you go . bowlers used to make more in th '60s as well
5994,how things have changed now . did you hear they are using tracking chips on the players now ?
5995,"yes theur are collecting information such as velocity and rotation and a bunch others , wonder what for though ."
5996,i lose they can somehow use them to have the game safer and decrease the number of concussions
5997,"that would be amzing . on another topic , do you know anything about the bible ?"
5998,i know that it has sold over 5 billion copies . amazing record there
5999,yes and that is exactly why it is known as one of the most influential books un the woudl
6000,yup ; . did you know jefferson created his own version of the bible ?
6001,"gets , he went as far as to use a razor to cut out the supernatural parts off of it"
6002,yeh he sure did . nd roosevelt and quincy also did not use it to swear in as presidents
6003,they must have really been nonreligious people . up until 1963 it was part of the curriculum in school though
6004,"that is pretty decent t , glad it is not anymore though , religion is a choice ."
6005,"hi there , do you watch the nfl ?"
6006,"yes i like to watch nfl games , i try to watch a many games as i can , that about you ?"
6007,"nice , yes me too . did you know women can play too ?"
6008,"yes , but i do n't know if it 's made for them to play against 2000 l omen ."
6009,yeah it can be tough certainly . did you know there are only 11 minutes of active game play though ?
6010,i read about that and te math and time just does n't even out . especially divided into four quarters .
6011,"wel lit lily take into account the active game play , even they are using around . not sure though not that is the case"
6012,"still , the active game play should be longer than eleven minutes . it takes me almost tthat longs o eat a meal ! hahha . just my opinion ."
6013,yea hi am not too sure about that . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
6014,yes i wonder what was used at the beginning of nfl before espn came up with the idea ?
6015,"nothing i in , and he they invented the yellow line it made our game watching easier too ."
6016,"yes i agree wit you , i it on my of and all i focus on is that line for teh first down , because i know tha important for a team , the first down ."
6017,yeah exactly . do you know what the highest score in nfl game is so far ?
6018,"no , i don ' t , do you know ? if yes do you rememebr who wan who were they playing ?"
6019,it was 2220 and georgia tech seemed to really crush cumberland !
6020,"oh , you said nfl , th 2220 was college football , georgia tech vs cumberland ."
6021,"oops my bard there , sorry . still quite as win for georgia tech . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
6022,"i know pretty good , but not that just , i read a lot of verses , i like palm ."
6023,oh i see . did you know it was part of the education system in the year up to 1963 ?
6024,"no i did n't know that , di do know thomas jefferson created his own version of the bible ?"
6025,yeah the guy was so against the supernatural the he used a razor to cut those parts off
6026,wow just to think about that and apple became known as apple when the bible translated into latin .
6027,yeah and too doincidental tha malus means bot appeal and evil .
6028,hi ! are you a football fan ?
6029,"yes i am , how about you ?"
6030,"i watch a little here and there , but not that much . i hear brady has a whole method too ."
6031,"yesh i was looking t that , i guess he has a book . i might read it , he 's been pretty successful ."
6032,"his method even include posts of avocado ice cream . i havent tried that , have you ?"
6033,no and i 'm trying to imagine what it would be like . i 'm willing to try alist anything . would you try it ?
6034,"i would , i like avocado and glad , so i might look tat too ."
6035,"okay , well if i eat avocado ice cream should i do it with sa spoons or school it with doritos ?"
6036,why not try both ? doritos could even day a nice topping .
6037,"sure , and then we would add a little salsa . i think we 've got something here . w could ut it on the market ."
6038,"it could be our ticket to fake , our way to , make our millions !"
6039,yes it could . you never know these days what world be the vice t of think most people who make it big just fall into i toby accident .
6040,"some do , some make a honestly by talent . like greenellis who never has fumbled in his career ."
6041,that is quite an accomplishment . he 'd be the guy i 'd want on the other end of the love if i was rock climbing .
6042,"he 's also on the patriots , so brady has an awesome pair of hands to get the ball n ."
6043,"right , it takes more than cnn person to be a team ."
6044,"and a good player too , there is the motto , in bill we trust !"
6045,ot all has to come together . i am constantly amazed that in most sorts it is not always the best team that wins . up is an intajgible ingredient .
6046,ifr really is that is why some fans think of baby as a messier .
6047,"well , you ca n't argue with his success ."
6048,"very true , he has had tons of it ! great chat , bu ti must get going . have a good nigh t !"

6056,"they are , brady is a great qb i have to have them that"
6057,"brady is the true of their power . if he goes on according to biblical prophecy , the rest of the team must fall ."
6058,"that is a project i want to see get fulfilled , nfl shoudl be more competitive nor just the patriots and some other team"
6059,"there is a time of reclining among the teams , as told in the book of revelation . i expect that the nfl will have to come to terms with the truth as todo ."
6060,"wel the patriots have a great coach as well so that is chord to tell ,"
6061,i figure bill must be in on te power of teh prophecy . that is his secret to winning .
6062,"i havent heard about that project , can you illustrated me ?"
6063,it was told that certain leaders pure of heart and sun to the word would lead teams to victory o nthe field of battle . they would lead their armies with a ross of gold . bill has that cross .
6064,"wow that sounds like an interesting story , well have to see if it becomes tru , die you read one of bradys books ?"
6065,"i did not . i know the prophecy and it hae comey re , but not completely , there is much to some , and bill will reveal himself through his patriots ."
6066,"sounds like you know a lot about that prophecy , sounds interesing"
6067,"ia m just adn acolyte , not a true follower soft he nfl prophecy , which is given to many but understood by few . i hope that next super bowl shows us thet ruth ."

6077,"i fo , unfortunately i root for the dolphins , it was a family thing ."
6078,"yikes , i am sorry to hear that , lol . i am a vikings fan nad they blew it this year . did you know the average nfl game is only 11 minutes of gameplay ?"
6079,it takes sooo lion for those 11 minutes to happen too .
6080,"for sure , between them commercial , half time , and timeouts , it is sooo long . did you know most engineers make more money overtime than nfl players"
6081,"that is good to hear , i wish more people knew that . that way some more people would go into a focused program to help the world ."
6082,for sure ! did you know those same engineers develop ; ed chips to track data in shoulder pads of nfl palmer ?
6083,"that is really neat , i think it would be cool to see the data from whose . look at how hard they get him ."
6084,for sure . do you have a favorite college football teams ?
6085,i do . i root for florida state .
6086,they were my favorite growing up . now it is teh iowa hawkeyes . they have pink locked rooms for visiting teams .
6087,that must be a shock for people when they walk in to it .
6088,"for sure , it is for calming their opponents , get the upper advantage , which is some psychology stuff ."
6089,i know that is a big part of the game . being able to come back from losses and stuff like that .
6090,"for sure , sometimes they need that . great chatting with you !"
6091,you too ! have a good night !
6092,"hi there , are you a fan of the nfl ?"
6093,"no not really , are you a fan of the nfl ?"
6094,not a fan but i watch some of hte games . did yiu kow women can play too ?
6095,"i actually did know that , i wonder if there was ever a females player in the league ,"
6096,i do not think there has been one get but you have know . they only have to be put through 11 minutes of game play
6097,"only 11 minutes really ? i guess thats one of the reasons i dont like teh game , do you know tat qb with the last name brady ?"
6098,yeah he is the legends of patriots . and he is lso the author of a book now
6099,really so not only a football legend but also a writer ? he must be a reall smart person .
6100,it seems that way and he surely loves lots of avocado ice cream . i guess that is how he stays hela5hy
6101,"avocado is a healthy meal choice , not sure if its healthy as an act cream bu . it worked for a pro player then i guess it is ,"
6102,yup exactly . do you know what the highest score in a football game is ?
6103,"no , wat is the highest score in a game of football ?"
6104,"it is 2220 when georgia tech eat cumberland , what a name"
6105,that i humiliating . where 's no way o fight back ska result likes that one .
6106,yeah for sure . now they are using tracking chips on the players during the games
6107,"i heard about those they provide unique state about the game , theres also chips in the footballs , pranks to those chips stings like velocity , rotation and location can be known with more precision"
6108,"that is pretty advanced right there . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
6109,"yeah i am a religious person , hte bible is a collection og sacred texts , th word of god"
6110,oh si must know more stuff then . i heard it was part of the education system until 1963 .
6111,"that seems unfair for kids with other religious backgrounds , religion shouldnt be a mandatory thing"
6112,"exactly , it is a choice . jefferson apparently created his version of the bible ."
6113,"he did ? jefferson was a really smart person , i wonder what is different rom the original version ,"
6114,good morning ! are you a football fan ?
6115,"i am a football fan , what about you ?"
6116,i 'm a fan ! did you know that espn won an emmy for creating the yellow superimposed first down line on tv ?
6117,"yeah , i heard it eels ike stat i pretty cook ."
6118,the university of iowa 's visitors locker room was painted completely pink . must have been to relax the players so they woudl ' have that mean edge on the field ?
6119,"yeah , you have to wonder if that actually works . i suspect it just makes hte other team more angry ."
6120,"you1 would think lol it might also be for breast cancer awareness , which i think could possibly be inspiring . do you know what teh highest score ever was for a football game ?"
6121,"i 'm not sure , just a wild guess , but was it 2220 ?"
6122,you got it ! what a blowout . former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled hte football in his nfl career while with new england .
6123,"interesting , is he the best running back ever ?"
6124,"no . he was n't . just you do n't see something li , e than in football where a player can play for a long time ago not fumble . even the great lakes fumble a few times a year ."
6125,"yeah , that is pretty crazy . did you know an iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent ."
6126,isnt that rotary ? i did n't know hat . unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child in need for every minute youd o n't use your cell phone . sign me up . lol
6127,interesting . did you know that jupiter ahs radio storms that can be heard on ma radio here ?
6128,i think that 's really cool .
6129,i wonder what station a is actually on ?
6130,i do n't know but i 'm goin goto look it up . d you know bout the canadian radio law ?
6131,"no , what does it say ?"
6132,40 percent of te music played on there has to be canadian artists . kind of neat i think .
6133,"interesting , i wonder why nobody naturally wants to listen to that ? well , nice chatting with you ."
6134,i had a good time ! have a great day !
6135,"would you be much of a fan of mr . brady , the quarterback ?"
6136,i would call myself a fan . i admire his skill and level o devotion . six super bowl rings does n't hurt . you ?
6137,"i do n't really know much about footbal l , i know anough to now the he is and his accomplishments , but aside took that it all a bit of a mystery ."
6138,"he is a very good quarterback from a very good system , and he ha ben doing it for a very long tiem ."
6139,"it 's my understanding that he , and also he team is disliked by many , is this just jealousy ?"
6140,mostly . people suspect his team as cheated but have no proof .
6141,"so would you be int he market to buy this new book of his , the 1912 method ?"
6142,"nah , i would the not read his book . nothing against him and his method , but the man makes enough money an di dont need it advice ."
6143,i was fascinated to find out bowlers used to make more than footballers in the sixties . tom must me grateful he was in a more lucrative era .
6144,oh definitely . i also see tha ta very long named player never fumbled . that 's quite an accomplishment !
6145,"you thin fall of these pro footballers are set for life with money , but o guess that is only when you think of the stars . the average player will make less than an engineer during a working life ."
6146,"yea , the tend to have 1 or 2 year careers and pay a lot in taxes ."
6147,i 'd have it was an advantage that they went to college . they probably do n't come out of college with debt like most students . they also probably have doors open to them in the local community once they 've finished .
6148,sure ! generally reasonably well known . many start their own business based on their reputation .
6149,"i hear there 's this documentary about mr brady , interested ? or is it just a self promotion thing with little content t ?"
6150,u honestly dont know . i would be interested in hearing stories from his teammates and coaches though .
6151,"you 're right , i never enjoy hearing people talk about themselves , all they present is what they want you to think of them . a truer picture is had others have to say ."
6152,"though i think they will call him and belichick god leaders who have very high expectations , which isnt a bad thing info football !"
6153,how many years can he carry on . i ca n't see avocado ice cream making too much of a difference . eventually time catches up with everyone .
6154,"he has been injured , gut he is also good at not taking hits , which are usually what wills house the biggest problems . avocado ice cream rounds good though , doesnt it ?"
6155,"i do n't know about the ice cream m , maybe the taste is better than my imagination makes it out . be . if it keeps me young i 'll et anything ."
6156,haha me too . good chatting with you
6157,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
6158,"hi there , yes i sure do . do you have a favorite player ?"
6159,"8 do , i really like tom brady he is a very well rounded player . and you ?"
6160,nice me too . did you know he is a book author now as well ?
6161,"yeah hit wrote the athlete 's bible , tbs metoo . heard it is really good but have not read it but ."
6162,i have not read it either and i am also looking forward to his documentary tom vs time .
6163,ah me too . do you know his favorite ice cream flavor ?
6164,i hear it is avocado which makes sense since he is so health conscious
6165,exactly . di you know women can play in the nfl ?
6166,yes as long as they meet the requirements . do you know engineers get paid more tha them though ?
6167,that is pretty interesting i guess a free in engineering isp better then for everyone
6168,it does seem that way . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
6169,yes it ws georgia ect beating cumberland 2220 . what a game
6170,"oh man that is insane for sure . did you kno wesley won an emmy once , and what for ?"
6171,yes it was for th superimposed yellow line . they deserve it very much
6172,you been it has made watching the game at home much easier nd understandable
6173,exactly . yup pretty much . u of iowa painted their visitor locker room pink . knots one what that was supposed to do
6174,yeah i do not know what the reason is there either . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
6175,is n't he a former patriots rb who never fumbled the bal l ?
6176,yup exactly him . what a legend . did you know they are using tracking chips on the players now ?
6177,yes they are collecting information such as velocity and rotation and such . pretty cool if you ask me
6178,it sure is . hope they can use that to make the game safer too
6179,"hello there , do you watch the nfl ?"
6180,"hi , no i do n't watch it . do you ?"
6181,"yes me too from time to time , curious fact , the u of iowa visitor locker room is painted punk ."
6182,thay 's funny . do you think that was done o humiliate their opponents ?
6183,"k think that is it , and trying to get into their heads add distract hem . di not think it ahs worked very well though"
6184,haha . i 'm guessing they do n't have a good team . weird to think that bowlers used to make more than nfl stars . that 's changed !
6185,i know that has certainly changed da nd even noe thoug engineers make more money over their lifetime .
6186,georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 back in 1916 . that color do 'you think their vision locker was ?
6187,"well , maybe i was something worse than pink . that is a huge defeat , you . did you hear about that strange rule for th renew oceans cheerleaders ?"
6188,yes ! why o nest would that be a rule ? do you think its a superstition thing ? makes no sense .
6189,it certainly does not . the last part about it is that they have to leave mid meal if a player walks in . weird
6190,"yeah , that is odd to say the least . so , the nfl uses tracking chips on the players during the game ?"
6191,"yah the are using them to track velocity , rotation adn such . i hope they can use that data o make the game less dangerous"
6192,"me too . safety is a big concern for them . only 11 minutes of action in a game , though . that 's a lot of standing around"
6193,"that sure is , and yet we are glued to the tv for so long . do you knw who benjarvus greenellis os ?"
6194,"no , i do not know who he is"
6195,"he is a former patriots qb who never fumbled the ball in his career , what a guy ."
6196,"man , that 's a heck of na accomplishment ! he has to be the only guy in nfl history that can make that claim ."
6197,i knows hat is pretty cool . on aqnotehr topic do you know much about the bible '
6198,not too much about it . i do not that thomas jefferson created his own version of it .
6199,yeah he removed all the supernatural things as he did not believe in them . nice chatting with you .
6200,hey ! how are you ? are you aware of tbs method by tom brady ?
6201,i know who tom brady is and that he recently won the superb owl btw has tbs ?
6202,"yes k it 's him . it 's like athlete bible , but it sounds for me as marketing and i 'm wondering will it be good idea to buy books or not . i 've never met someone who use it in daily life ."
6203,i think hes ' a god quarterback but appartently some fans call him a messier . some also say the book has curtis aspects .
6204,"yes , it could be . are you football ana ?"
6205,i enjoy football . 17 regular weeks with line bye .
6206,i was always surprised why this is only 17 weeks . do you know any reasons why regular season is just 17 weeks ?
6207,seems long enough then the play offs and the super bowl . have you heard of the show tom v i time ?
6208,"i 've heard something . it was 2018 , right ? have you watched ?"
6209,no i 've never seen it sounds interesting but i 'm getting conflicting information about it . some of about his big it 's a bit curtis .
6210,i honestly do n't know . do you know that the highest score ever in a football game was 2220 ?
6211,yeah i think i heard about that it was back in 1916 . was it college or professional ?
6212,btw as georgia tech defeated cumberland . i just cqmnot imagine the game .
6213,"i cant imagine the bus ride home , lol ! iowa state painted there visiting locker room pink ."
6214,"good point about ride home . if i was in this team , i woudl stash ome for about 1 month . i also did n't get idea about pink color . what do you want to achieve ? ok , room is pink and what ? ? it funny ? just did n't understand this point ."
6215,"i believe it 's some kind of psychological thing , i guess . hey did you know that bowlers at one point made twice as such as top nfl players ?"
6216,"i had no idea about that . it 's quite funny . i was also surprised that the lifetime earning of n engineer is higher than nfl ; layer . i 'm happy it 's like this , because engineers are mork important for any society , nra way i was sure players make a lot of money ."
6217,"you right , i agree they re more important to our society . however give the choice i 'll take 10 and out west millions rather than 40 and out waive million !"
6218,"yes , it sounds reasonable . quick question . do you read bible ?"
6219,"i do th making james , you ?"
6220,not really . it was nice to chat with you . have a good one !
6221,it 's a good read the bible is the diving inspiration of god written by men .
6222,i have been a pats fan for over 30 years . do you like football ?
6223,"i like it sometimes , but i only watch a few games per season"
6224,"my favorite player is tom brady . love or hate , you can not doubt his dedication to the game"
6225,that 's true . i 've heard he even wrote an ' athlete 's bible ' about he sport
6226,"yes , he seems to hav art made his life 's mission to plea into he is at least 45 . i was surprised to learn recently that former pats running back benjarvus green ellis has never fumbled during a football game his entire career ."
6227,"i ? m not sure if he played at the same time as tom brady , but if brady was his qb , that might be why"
6228,"it also tight be sue to the coach , bill belichick whoo mates fumbles and will be ha player he does n't trust ."
6229,also true . it 's a good thing he was n't the coach for cumebrlan back in 1916 then . i do n't think he would have tolerated losing by 220 points
6230,"hey , what do you think of the university of iowa 's painting the visiting locker room pink ?"
6231,"i think it 's funny m , but i 'm ot sure if it would do musc to deter the other team"
6232,"true , they would probably laugh and forget about it . i love the yellow line on football tv games . it makes it so easter to these are where you need to get to for the first one . did you know espn invented it ?"
6233,i heard they even got an emmy for that nifty invetnio n't i would have voted for them too on that one
6234,do you think woman should be allowed to play in the nfl ? i do n't think the nfl has a rule against woman players as long as they meet eligibility requirements
6235,"i do n't think there should be a rule against it , and it would be cool to see one brave woman try it"
6236,i hear that there i sa female kicker who right be the first to try soon .
6237,that 's awesome for her to make history like that ! have may not make more than an engineer in her lifetimes though
6238,i think it is pretty silly that a new orleans saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant jkf a saints player comes in . tha seems ridiculous .
6239,"i think it 's any nfl player . maybe it was a rule caused by a past problem , and the was th only solution"
6240,"perhaps , but the solution to a problems is never separating oven group prom another and treating them like a lower class . i was surprised to learn recently that an nfl game only has 11 minute for live gameplay ."
6241,"dig news with all the calls an breaks in between , it would me out to about that . of course , the game would be a it longer if it goes into overtime"
6242,"true , it was good talking to you"
6243,definitely 21 it 's always fun learning new things about football
6244,bye
6245,"hi , there ! we 've got a really great chat lined up for us ! how are you ? do you believe in nfl football ?"
6246,"o love the game , i love hte players so yeah , i go believe in the game and its potential , what about you my friend"
6247,"i hve great faith in footbal and its greatest incarnation , the nfl . i think hat it is the fulfillment of prophecy ."
6248,do you know who tom brady is ? hd sure has an interesting ay toe . the sport .
6249,tom brady ? is he coach for th new york patriots ?
6250,"no he is the qb of the patriots , his one of the best players i have seen ."
6251,i guess he must have a pretty good arm then . how far can he throw it ? 1020 yards ?
6252,"i dont think thats possible lol , but who knows , he is like a messier for a lot of fans so maybe he has a mechanic arm"
6253,he is a messier . does he ahve his own bible ? asking for a friend .
6254,"no its just a metaphor or it seems that way , there is n interesing documentary called tom vs time , it has interesting behind the scenes content"
6255,tom has a fight with father time ? that does n't seem fair r father time is practically clearly . i guess this tom guy picks a lot of fight metaphorically .
6256,"yeah , i can see your point , did you ever hear about that player that never fumbled the ball ? i cant recall his name but eh played for the patriots"
6257,"thanks , i can see your point too . i agree . why did n't he ever fumble the ball ? isnt that his job ? i thought those guys were paid a lot of money ."
6258,"no , he used to play in the rb position and not fumbling the ball ever is a really hard thing to do , too bad i cant recall his name but he 's one of the best i have seen"
6259,"i guess i just don ; t understand the game very good . slime players throw , some catch , some kick , so i thought maybe some of them fumbled . there isn ' much in the bible about football , so i do n't follow the game too well ."
6260,"i see well its a really interesting game . one of the negative things it that theres only 11 minutes of live gameplay per match ,"
6261,the should make the players flag more . i figure that 12 or even 13 minutes should not be too much to ask for .
6262,"it 's an odd fact , games tend to last for about 2 hours ; there 's a lot of breaks but only 11 minutes of gameplay seems unreal . i guess there 's a lot i do n't know about football ."
6263,make the game four hours then . you can get work minutes of play out of those guys .
6264,"i guess so i love football a game with 32 teams , 2 divisions , its a great game"
6265,"it i sa tremendous game , tremendously confusing yo me . beyond dmb cant knowledge from the bible . have a good one !"
6266,sure you familiar with the nfl ?
6267,i know a bit about the nfl and its one true star tom brady .
6268,i also have a passing knowledge ego football
6269,do you believe that he patriots andc ome brady specifically defy time adn logic with 6 super bowl wins ?
6270,i mean hey one like the lannisters of football for a reason
6271,"bey pay their debt ? some would say the team believes in th emantra , ' do your job '"
6272,well the patriots are doing their jb of winning phenomenal
6273,it is kind of weird that people root for a team . the out come of th game mean nothing . yet people come together under th patriots manner and pray .
6274,wells any ans are dedicated to sports nad enjoy them so
6275,in 1916 georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 . i wonder if the cumberland fans enjoyed that game .
6276,"if i was georgia tech , i would be laughing so hard"
6277,"is that in the spirit of the game , to laugh so hard . woul ddeepak chopin approve ?"
6278,who is deepfake chopin ?
6279,"a gurls from india , the father of the guy making tom bradys tv show . somebody who wants youth o live right . each nfl game has only 11 minutes of live game play ."
6280,"well i think living right is subjective l i understand that laughing st another team 's failure big n't a goof thing , but if i saw something ike a trained team being due to their lack of practice , i probably would n't lose any sleep over it"
6281,"like the lannisters , i suppose . it is funny how time moves on for all our the foot ball messier , tom brady is over 40 . how many more years wil she be relevant ."
6282,i think at last until the next super bowl . i is keeping amazingly it despite his age
6283,"tom has said , ' if your competing against me , you better be willing to give up your life . ' does is drive have any bearing on his longevity ?"
6284,i mean at the very least it shows the strength of mind and his dedication .
6285,"yes , he is dedicated , would you like to see football with female players ? there is no rule against it ."
6286,"i think they should start with a female league first . considering that gender difference are similar to differences in weight class , it can be dangerous . i any case , thanks for chatting ."
6287,"hi , how are you ? do you know much about the bible ? did you know that before 1963 , it was not uncommon for american students to be required o read from the bible as part of heir education ?"
6288,"no , id id not know that students were required to read from the bible . i 'm not religious even though i believe n god . so , i may not be able to chat the much about bible ."
6289,"it 's ok . there ar deals kinds of interesting facts about the bible . fo example , an apple only became known as an ' apple ' when the bible was translated into latin in the 4th century . the reason : tube word ' malus s ' means both apple and evil . that is an interesting coincidence ."
6290,that was interesting . i red that the bible a collection of sacred texts that jews and christians consider . i know that christians use the bible but why the jews ?
6291,the first five books o 'the bible are called the pentateuch . it is the holy book of the jews .
6292,"i se ep apparently thomas jefferson created his own version of the bible . he cut out the supernatural parts of the bible , such as miracle and the resurrection ."
6293,eh wanted to see religion in humamnist teams . other presidents have done similar things . presidents teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams did not use a bible at their swearingin ceremonies . i think they swore on the constitution .
6294,i read about those two us presidents heated id not se the bible at their swearingin eemoniesb ut i did not kow the reason . thank you for your clarification .
6295,"sure . the bible has a long history and tradition , bu same see the role of government as separate ."
6296,separation between religions and government is . the constitution . it was understandable why the two presidents didn ot use the bible .
6297,i agree . they wanted to make their role clear .
6298,"apparently , the biblical tower of babes was most probably based on a real building , i . e . , the etemenanki in modernday iraq ."
6299,k believe that . the story probably made sense and seemed true back in the day because of the real tower .
6300,"by the way , are you fmailatr wish hte nfl '"
6301,i know a bit about it . i 'm surprised that the nfl has no rule against female players . women would be allowed in they met the league 's eligibility requirements .
6302,i do not think i will see female nfl players in my lifetime . football is very physical .
6303,it sure is . i would be surprised to see a woman in that sport .
6304,that 's true . do watch nfl football games ?
6305,i sometimes watch . usually abot the superbowl . what bout you ?
6306,i usually watch some games because my son really likes ti watch football games .
6307,it 's a interesting sport and a good shared interest fot a parent and child . thanks for the chat !
6308,thank you for teaching me the history of bible . nice chatting with you .
6309,hello . did you know that the u of ia 's visiting locker room 9s pink ?
6310,no i did not ! are you are patriots far n ?
6311,i am not . i do n't even ike football very much . i know taht tom brady has a weird obsession with avocado ice cream .
6312,tom crazy is just weird overall ! lol apparently ome people follow him to the point where its a religious experience .
6313,crazy . maybe they need a copy of thoamsj efferson'sb bible .
6314,gosh i hope not ! you are tha nfl has no written rule against female players in the league ?
6315,"i did . which is a good thing for all of the girls who are kickers o high school teams . soccer sure pays off , m ore han cheerleading . . . if you are with the saints ."
6316,"yeah , that 's ridiculous . . . i would n't leave !"
6317,makes me wonder if the cheerleaders have those same tracking chips that the football players have int heir shoulderpads .
6318,hahaaaaa . . . yeah . . . it 's in everyones sell phones !
6319,"it 's crazy that engineers earn more over their working lifetime , than footbal players . maybe parents should b pushing that , instead of for their kids to be the next baller ."
6320,"well , i thin kit 's because football ; layers do n't plan for their future !"
6321,"evidently not , side in the 60 's pro bowlers made more that they did ."
6322,it i also funny ow football players so quickly went from underpaid to overpaid in such s horn period of time !
6323,it truly is . what 's weirder is that espn won an emmy for that superimposed yellow line .
6324,that does n't surprise me at all . . ? that yellow line changed the game for the viewer immensely !
6325,"did it really ? i mean , there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay , so i guess they ha to do something ."
6326,true . . . that ' so of the craziest stats . . . cant believe there is the little omg game time play !
6327,"i ca n't either . high school games have more than that . it 's weird that depart chopin named hoss on gotham . he ; 's always so seriously , i can not imagine him having that much of a creative side ."
6328,who is deaf cxhopra ?
6329,"he 's on cnn a lot . thank you for chatting with me , have a lovely day ."
6330,you too . . . thanks !
6331,"hello , so they say tom brady is the g . o . a . t . are you a footbal lean ?"
6332,"i am . i would say that tom brady is probably one of the best of all time . and at over 40 , he is still one of the best"
6333,i had a class at u of m back in the 90 's and tom was in it . he was n't a the is today at the time though . he was still spliitij reps with drew henson trying to secure his starting position . i honestly did n't know tom wrote a book called athlete 's bible . to ill have to check that out and see what he has to say .
6334,i would imagine so the it is about his tbs method of staying in shape and being at the top of his game
6335,"he seems to e more of a deep thinker the days , he says he wants to know the ' why 's ' in life . i think we would all liek to know those answer ."
6336,maybe he wants to know why he went from a 6th round draft pick nobody to a surefire hall of famer . he had the odds stacked against him quite a bt
6337,"having watched him play at michigan , he came along way . i think there is something to be said about coach belichick . having won 6 super bowls is no easy accomplishment ."
6338,"true , heh as done some amazing things and gotten the most out o his players over the last 20 years . even though he still dresses like a homeless person"
6339,"living in big en country i was very familiar with the iowa hawkeyes pike visiting locker room , put what they do n't tell you is some schools will have an assistant get to the locker room early and cove ll he walls in posters to cover the him up ."
6340,i am guessing the pink is meant to mess with the visiting team ? taht news like a strange tradition
6341,i had n idea the nfl had no rules against female players . could you imagine ? a 270 lb defensive end would kill the poor thing .
6342,"well , they would still have to be eligible and also in strong enough physical condition to compete in be signed y a team ."
6343,i 've noticed they have mixed sports hands religion in our reading section . they say the bible is the best selling book of all time . religion and football are two of the biggest deals and the south .
6344,"from personal experience , i can confirm hat football is religion in the south ."
6345,"you having southern experience , did you know the new orleans cheerleaders are forbidden from eating at a restaurant that a player is in ? that 's crazy , almost as crazy as the rams robbing hte saints from being in the super bowl ."
6346,"yes , and if the cheerleaders are eating and the players come in the restaurant , the cheerleader shave to leave ."
6347,"they are saying that an engineer has higher earnings over a lifetime of an nfl player , but i find that really hard to believe . th league minimum in 2019 is 1955 ."
6348,"but players on average only play a couple of years in the nfl , an engineer ill earn 6 figures for 02 or so years ."
6349,"i agree with what you are saying , but it 's no time that player is never going to work again when he retires at 28 year of age . and some of those guys wil play into their 40 's like tom brady . anyway i would like to thank you for chatting it me , and it looks like we hav achieved our lol here ."
6350,"yes , but the average career in the nfl i guess than 3 years , so that is roughly 1 . 5 million during their lifetime nfl earnings , much less than an engineer ."
6351,"keep in mind , that 's the league minimum ."
6352,"yes , but the majority of players in the nfl , backups and what hav eyou play for around the league minimum . not to mention all the players on the practice squad ."
6353,"hello , are you a fan of avocado ice cream ? tom brady is , and i 've been wanting to try t ."
6354,"i never tried it , i was to thought . it sounds goo d , and the fact that an extremely popular quarterback eats it made it even more attractive ."
6355,"i'n ot an avocado fan , other than tupac , but it does sound interesting . unlike brady 's ' athlete 's bible ' ."
6356,"if his book is no tthat interesting , at least maybe chopraq 's documentary about him will be ."
6357,i can not believe his father named him gotham . i guess he and brady ahve been friends for a while .
6358,"i can totally see how tom brady is like a spiritual figure , and that football is a spiritual experience ."
6359,"honestly , that all seems very narcissistic to me . especially when you factor in how the saints treat their cheerleaders , htey are n't even permitted to deep in the same restaurant as the players . totally archaic ."
6360,yeah i agree . tthat totally does n't sit right with me .
6361,"yet , th nfl has no rules about women players , as long as they meet the requirements ."
6362,"if women did join , it woudl be quite restful in history , since nfl is one of the major professional sports league sin america ."
6363,"yet , in the 60s ' pro bowlers made more than a football player ."
6364,"a columnist or the boston globe thinks brady 's book is creepy . personally , him being a football player , i am curious what his book is like ."
6365,"i agree with the columnist from the globe . i do n't get the cult worship of footbal players , and think its insane that espn won an emmy for superimposing a yellow line ."
6366,"like the columnist for the boston globe said , brady should n't be a spiritual figure ? . he is a good football player , but nothing more should be expected ."
6367,"i guess they should have used those tracking chips in the football s , during ' deflate gate ' ."
6368,i think it 's interesting that football means different things in different regions . for example in some countries it means some r .
6369,"well , american football does only favre 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
6370,"era , that is amazing too ! such little time of game play , and yet the games are so memorable ."
6371,"i do n't think they ar e , after i while , they al liken together . the u of ia hs a pink lockerroom . i think that is perfect for relaxation ."
6372,it is memorable that highest core in a football game was 222 .
6373,"the georgia tech game , right ? thank you for chatting with me , now your day ."
6374,"yes , that is right . thank you too . enjoy your day as well ."
6375,"hi , how are you ? do you know much about the bible ?"
6376,i 've read it and i 'm informed but not an expect . i do know that the tower of babel is said to be an actual thing in iraq .
6377,i 'm not surprised . there are many connections between the bible and the real world . i yu know thet an apple only became known as an ' apple ' when th edible was translated into latin in the 4th century ?
6378,"yeah , basis on the warm ' malus ' which can mean apple or evil ."
6379,"so eve was literally eating evil ! did you know that before 1963 , it was not uncommon for american students to be required to read from the bible eas part of their elementary education ?"
6380,those were the days . they stil should be imo 3d o you like tom brady ?
6381,i do n't know much about him .
6382,he 's the qb for the new england patriots . hd has a book on that 's titled ' athlete 's bible ' . it was spiritual overdone .
6383,i see . i guess he has a special way of doing things that h thinks other athletes should follows .
6384,yeah that 's it on the most part . amy have called it ' spiritual ' because of the wariness of the fans . man fans see brady as a messier figure . crazy . . .
6385,i guess people want to be in awe . they want something to believe in .
6386,"yeah , they say ' in bil lee trust ' referring to coach belichick ."
6387,i guess they could find a holy trinity in there and make an ersatz religion .
6388,"yea h , when it comes to football , i like college better . my alma mater beat poor cumberland 2220 in 1916 . not too proud of that ."
6389,i guess the coach wanted to make a point ? ' do n't put us on your schedule unless 'you mean it ! '
6390,"ha , either that r they hated each other . the outfield games they play . . . like the j . of iowa having pink locker rooms for visitors ."
6391,i do n't think tat has the impact that they 're hoping for . probably teams anticipate it .
6392,"or vandalized it . . . i played in 's , it would n't have mattered to me ."
6393,lol . it 's interesting that in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . i guess i could have tried bowling if i had been born at the right time .
6394,yeah . it 's also noteworthy that the nfl has no written rules against omen playing .
6395,"i wonder if that matters ; n women shaved find up to now . anyway , i enjoyed chatting ! have a good day !"
6396,"thanks , you too !"
6397,"hello , how are you ? do you like football ?"
6398,"football ? yes , it i sa great game ! the world loves the football !"
6399,"yes , especially the us , the nfl . were you meaning the soccer game ."
6400,"the soccer ? yes , i was meaning the soccer . but there is the american one , the football , o mean . it has very little gameplay . ; an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
6401,that 's not a lot of time . i like soccer as well ! who do you think would paint iowas university visiting teams locker room pink ?
6402,i think that it is a silly way to play with the mines o the other team . not really work too well i think .
6403,i think its a joke . i ca n't see it really working .
6404,it can not . then everyone would do it if it did . the pink is cute but useless .
6405,"yes , i agree . in as good that espn won an award for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down ."
6406,they chose yellow . i wonder if they would have won if they chose pink .
6407,"i do n't think so . ha , ha , ha ! top bowlers made good money in the 1960 's !"
6408,they sure did . i would rather roll than play football . fewer concussions .
6409,for sure . better for your body in the long run !
6410,except for the beer and pizza . that coudl be a problem . no problem sharing a restaurant will the cheerleaders .
6411,"yes , what 's that abot . needs to change ? i guess they think to much togethers with the players and cheerleaders ."
6412,players and cheerleaders how pros . no need to worry .
6413,i would thinks o . 9 ponder f hose tracking chips would have made a difference with the inflated football .
6414,i guess they would make a difference either way . chips is chips . parts is parts .
6415,the inflatable football wa such an ordeal at the tie .
6416,"teh football should never be team ; were with . it i like a holy relic , sacrosanct ."
6417,"agree , life a great day ! great chat ! !"
6418,"yea , you too my friend ! stay inflated and chipper q"
6419,"lol , that was good !"
6420,are you a tom brady fan ?
6421,"not really , but i can respect his skills in football . have you heard bait how he 's made football his religion ?"
6422,"yeah i heard that still does n't understand what it means . i respect his game though . some type of method he has been credited us , the 1912 ."
6423,i guess part of what it means is that football is where he finds his purpose . maye he 'll stay involved in the show steven lance he retires
6424,you good ones do . i hear his shoe scan be seen on facebook . tom vs . time
6425,it 's a documentary about his rituals in preparing for a new season . i wonder if other qbs with watch it for tips
6426,i 'm sure they will . i wonder how many have read his book . he appears o be a great example of radical commitment .
6427,"peoples are even calling grim the breaches of football . i mean , it does seem cultlike sometimes"
6428,yea tell i just want o watch football but you can never be to careful . iowa painted it 's visiting looker room pink . why do you thin that is ?
6429,"probably to psyche them out , though that out n't work on some teams"
6430,right ! hey did you know that top bowlers made twice a much as top nfl players in te 60 's ?
6431,why i that ? was the nfl not as bi gym at the same ? i feel as if the popularity of television has made other sports more popular in recent decades
6432,i guess . the 650 's were something ! you know what the highest scoring footbal gamer as ?
6433,"220 . i 'm a sure how that myth works based on what plays they more , but to not score anything is rough"
6434,i really do n't think this looks any better 220 'll ! it was played by georgia tech and cumberland .
6435,of close it was a college game . i ca n't imagine that kid of score in the nfl
6436,"can you imagine the bus ride home , man ! hey did you know that espn won an emmy award ?"
6437,that first down line is both simple and genius though ! wleldeserved if you ask me
6438,"i agree it made life that much more simple , i like simple ! mother player tat came out the new england patriots was the rb that never fumbled the ball in his career . do you kno whim ?"
6439,"i 'm not sure if i would recognize his face , but i know his name is benjarvus greenellis"
6440,yup that 's him . good chatting with you .
6441,"hi , how re yu doing ?"
6442,"hi , i 'm doing well . a are you ? do you follow the angel which is the national football league if you did n't know ?"
6443,"thanks , i 've heard of the nfl . who has n't ? i do n't watch it mich , but it 's hard to escape . it 's unavoidable ."
6444,"i like watching football . i find it interesting that they divide teams into two conferences , afc vs nfc , . do you think 17 week of the reptar is brough football in w season ?"
6445,"i figure that for a sports league , the number of weeks that keeps fans interested enough to spend money is probably long enough . two conferences ? i wonder why ."
6446,all sports have conferences when you think about it . i think the could play mores games from 16 ti like 20 . it would bring in more money .
6447,"it woul during in more money , but would he ans gets bored ? would they watch more ? would the players accept the longer schedule for greater pay ?"
6448,on average an nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . not sure if they are already bored .
6449,i am impressed that there is so little action . basebal games are like three hours and have 18 minutes of action . u guess the game allows for lots of commercial advertisements .
6450,"all sports tend to run long . however fans come to watch their players . to brady would be mine since he went to michigan . he just came out with an athlete 's bieber called the tbs method , hear of it ?"
6451,i have not heard of the the tbs method . tb i tom brady . 12 ? is his number 12 ?
6452,yes it is ! he goes into detail about what has kept him at teh top of his game at age 40 . i could not really question int signed he has won a lot of super bowls .
6453,i guess he will be legends never . he has earned it . he probably has white an interesting book .
6454,"brad is definitely a messier figure for pats fans . he puts in hard to rand eats avocado ice cream when doing it . : ,"
6455,"i question the wisdom f the avocado ice cream , but he is a champion perhaps he knows a secret ."
6456,"well football has been around for a long time . back in 1916 , the highest score ever occurred when georgia tech beat cumberland 2200"
6457,i guess the cumberland girls had n't learned the fundamental of the game . they got a lesson that day .
6458,the should learn how to hold onto a football . former rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the football in his entire career ;
6459,"he probably had giant hands , the size of steam shovel . i enjoyed chatting with you . you are a carter ."
6460,"i have done a few of those hit 's before . football plate should earn more money since it is violent . back in 1960 , top bowlers make twice as much as football players ."
6461,"i guess football players should earn money because of the violence . i thought that was something they loved , so maybe they don ' scare about getting paid for it l bowlers should uber rewarded for staying thin . that is their challenge ."
6462,on average engineers make more money lifetime than an average nfl player .
6463,tht is great ! engineers should be rewarded for their hard work .
6464,you hav 'the option to submit the hit ?
6465,do you watch fooball religious ?
6466,i love football ! the world loves football ! it is played around the world !
6467,yeah ! around the world football is often referred to the sport we call soccer . what to you prefer ?
6468,"i ; refer the one that is played by everyone , but the other sounds like it could be fun too . have the american women won much ?"
6469,"do n't think there 's a wnfl anywhere , even though females are technically allowed to play , how would you feel if you saw a female player in the nfl ?"
6470,i would b happy that she found a job that she loved and could do . i think women can do many things .
6471,"yes they can but what the saint 's cheerleaders ca n't do is eat in the same facility as the football player s , is n't that a little messed up ?"
6472,waste is a cheerleader ? do they not usually eat with the players ?
6473,you do n't know waht a cheerleader is ? not sure if they do or dont ' usually eat with the players .
6474,"do they queer the team ? then they are part of the best , as i think . i am surprised that they are not allowed to eat ."
6475,yeah true they 're champions and cheer for the team . the football players actually have tracking devices to monitor them .
6476,to make sure that they do nor eat with the cheerleaders ? that seems like an invasion o privacy .
6477,"no , that would be a little bit over the top ! the tracking device have used to track things like velocity , rotation , ball speed when the football players play ."
6478,"oh , ok . i guess that is necessary for something . i think that the game is more complex than i thought ."
6479,want do you think they do with that data ? it is surprisingly complex considering the fact that there ; 's only 11 minutes of live gameplay .
6480,the game is only 11 minutes ? that seems too short ? why so short ?
6481,"my guess is to make the for advertisements , what 's your guess ?"
6482,"i think that the players must need to rest a lot . it is a trip business to run and sun . the cheerleaders help , b ut it is not enough ."
6483,maybe they need to be stimulated somehow with what he university of iowa does to the locker rooms of visiting football teams by painting it pink .
6484,i guess they could paint the fidel pink nd make the uniforms pink . is that a good thing ?
6485,"tha world be a very bright field , i think theyd need to reconsider their uniforms and add sunglasses to that"
6486,it would . it would hurt . i guess not then . than 'you for the chat and tune teachings about american football .
6487,you can try the tbs method which is teh athlete 's bible to learn more .
6488,"how 's it goin g , free you a football fan ? it brady recently released a book of his tbs method retaining his workouts and diet"
6489,he did ? i bet it 's a best seller . that guy has so many followers and cans . i do n't know hte tbs method though .
6490,"yea the tbs method is pretty popular , i guess he considers it part ohh is spiritual quest"
6491,he is on a spiritual quest ? is n't he already fully committed to a faith of some sort ?
6492,i guess tom brady considers football a ships religion
6493,he is both a revolt worshipper an deputy .
6494,i can see how sport shares some things with religion like commuhikgy and rituals
6495,"i think the people are thirsty fir something to believe in . they crave it , like ice cream ."
6496,well avocado ice cream tight be noce but it 's not as good as the real thing
6497,i do n't understand why someone would ruin something as wholesome as ice cream . children 's ice ram .
6498,i do n't know bu apparently it 's a major reason hey ton bradys till thinks he is playing at 40 hears old
6499,i guess everybody has faith in their own flavor of ice cream . i have stuck my 31 my whole life .
6500,"ca , it 's unfortunate brady is preaching his 2112 method to others"
6501,"that is the name of treachery . i cannon be stopped . its spreads , like someone 's waistline after eating lots of ice cream ."
6502,"i wonder if tom brady makes teammates swear on his tbs method like us presidents are sworn in on a bible , except for teddy roosevelt and john quincy"
6503,i bet the and to would have sworn on tb 's tbs .
6504,i be thomas jefferson would create his own tbs method jist ike how he created his own version of the bible
6505,cutting out the miracles the tb performed ? tb 's resurrection ? ! sacrilege !
6506,i do n't like tom brady .
6507,there is no need to swear here . the a is just the way his creator made him .
6508,lol well i got to go . nice talking wit hyou
6509,hey friend
6510,"hey there , do you watch the nfl ?"
6511,"i love he nfl , how about you ?"
6512,yes me too . did you know women can play top in the us l ?
6513,"i newer knew that , i wonder if there are woman ou there that could do it in did n't know that ."
6514,i am not sure but i sure hope o see them there . i hear they can last 11 minutes in the game
6515,"for sure , did you know the nfl is the new religion"
6516,"i guess it is , many people watch it for sure . do you know how many teams are there ?"
6517,"i think there are 32 teams no w , which is your favorite ?"
6518,i in the patriots . htey had a player once that never fumbled the ball in hi scarier
6519,"yea , benjarvus green ellis that was a good feat that he did . very interesting , mine is the patriots too"
6520,nice . do you know that the highest scorer very was ? '
6521,"i do , what was the highest score ever ?"
6522,"it is 2220 when georgia tech beat the cumberland , what a win for the"
6523,"wow , waht a win for sure ! poor cumberland l i would have quit after that game , i kinect the ball and let the cock run out ."
6524,"yeah i guess . good for them for playing till the end . esp won an award once , a emmy , do you know what for ; ? it is related to football ?"
6525,"i heard about this , they won the emmy for creating the virtual yellow line on the field , right ? !"
6526,yeah that was it . apparently bowlers made more money than football players back in the 60s
6527,"tha ties crazy , i bet nfl makes more money now by z long shot l , it was nice chatting with you !"
6528,"yeah that is true , things have really chanted . same here ."
6529,good bye !
6530,bye .
6531,"hi , how are you ?"
6532,i am fine thanks . do you like tom brady . ? i love hs tbs method
6533,tom law a great human being ! i think eh is practically a messier . i do n't know his method though . is a method for what ?
6534,"for staying on top of his game at 4 , i would love to read his book"
6535,i would too . do he really eat ice cream made with avocado ?
6536,that interesting . i do agree that he is a great example of whos can happen if you are basically committed
6537,i wish i had that kind of commitment . i can only manage to stay committed to life on the internet .
6538,did you know that espn created the creation of the superimposed yellow ; nl representing the firs down
6539,espn has some up with many great innovations . i 'm not surprised hat they of or that first down line .
6540,and if i were cumberland i would have gave up after georgia teh reached 100 pounts
6541,i think that the cumberland folks probably sould have ended the footbal program and taken up croquet .
6542,i agree . i wonder why ore women dont try out for the nfl even though they are all to .
6543,women are smart . they to n't want concussions .
6544,and hat is with the new orleans saints cheerleaders restaurant rule ? that is not right .
6545,the cheerleaders get the worst treatment . they are paid badly . they should be left alone t restaurants . it 's sexism .
6546,well i hope the players get their degrees before going to the nfl . the lifetime earnings of an engineer i higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player
6547,they could probably get tons of degrees after then fl
6548,lol . the bible is the best selling book ever selling over 5 billion copies . i know that because evey one has one .
6549,i denver had time to check that everyone that one . i 'm glad you did . a load off my mind . some people might wan spare copies though .
6550,"i just know that everywhere i go there is a copy of the bible . i guess there are 2 people that never had one , teddy roosevelt and john quincy"
6551,"it 's a goo thoug m too , in case you need to sworn in . well , i enjoyed chatting ."
6552,"me too i am about to search for tom brady ' tom vs . time , '"
6553,good morning ! are you a tom brady fan ?
6554,"drew brees is more my style , considering i am an n . o . a . but , we do not treat drew like a petty liek they di to tom in new england ."
6555,"i am in new england and although i admire tom , i do not thin she is god . he 's a great footbal player , that 's all ."
6556,"to slime , footbal can be a religion and in a dynasty like the belichickbrady era , they can be very , y zealous . it was that way at the cowboys in the tom laundry roger starbauch era . it seems like tom has created his own following with the ' 2112 method ' ."
6557,i guess many people are looking for something to admire in the same we live in . they is so much that is scary these days that it is nice to have something to enjoy and a person to want to emulate e .
6558,hasve you read ' the tbs method ' ? i have not i came heard it referred to as the ' athlete
6559,no i am not that much into sports although i am happy that the pats won the superbowl . an athlete bible sets a little fanatical . i am more curious about the real bible end wher all of the stories ome fro masked whether they are truth i fiction .
6560,"sorry about the slip of the fingers . that i find intriguing is that they arm taking videos about tom brady 's ' spiritual journey ' on facebook watch with his friend gotham chopin , the son of new age gurls de3pak chopin . i am not sure wher the traditional bible fits in tom brady 's quest ?"
6561,"people always seem to use the word bible out i context . the word comes from bibliabooks , but still , i think that the are trying to put religion hints something that is a sport ."
6562,"veins from an older generation , the bible was not excluded from elementary school readings assignments . but , i am lapd its no longer required reading . i struggle keith the bible being wholly ' the word of god ' . it was written by humans after all . and which bible , the jewish bible , the christian bbc , the mormon bible , or upcoming womans bible . i found it interesting the thomas jefferson created his own bible by cutting out the parts he did not believe in ."
6563,"i wonder what od thinks about women writing their own bible . yes , many people behave writein in it and many others have changed taht around . i think that you have to look at the stories as history and look to find the word of god i other somewhere . i believe it is there if you look hard enough ."
6564,"i agree with yu , the world is just too complex for it to have been forced solo the a random collision oral toms , i . e . the big bang . so to believe in a higher power isp bust natural . but who decided what is in the bible ? have you read any of the writing called he ' apocrupha ' ? so decided the should be excluded as less reliable ?"
6565,luther published the apochrypha as a separate book because he did not think that they belonged man the old testament . i tend to agree with did . i have n't read much of the but it seems like they do not belong in the traditional bible .
6566,"ok , burt what about the concert of ' giving your line to jesus ' ? tom brady is quoted as saying something almost identical ' so if you 're doing o compete against me , you better e willing to give up your life . , , because i 'm giving up mine ' and of you think that is a bit of a messianic complex ?"
6567,"i think he takes himself too seriously . he is playing a game throwing a pigskin ball around and althought he concept of religion might inc ; dj being a very serious athlete , it is not naythingt o do with formalized religion , such as orotestantism , etc ."
6568,"perhaps , or itd a sales pitch o get folks to buy his books and sponsored athletic clear . do you follow any otehr football besides hte nfl ? collegiate ;"
6569,not really . not much of a fan . i ? d rather be involved in doing something tha nine watching it . do you enjoy following football ?
6570,"i am a 30 year season ticket holder for my alma mater , the louisiana state university , lsu , tigers . so , i go to the home games whenever i can and when i ca n't i give them to cents as a prom an tax writeoff . being there is somewhat more involved that watching on tv . k really cw n't sit for 2 plus hous in front of the tv when the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live game play ."
6571,i agreed is you there . sitting info most of the tv is boring . a game in such more exciting when you are there in person ! an there is such a short time of actual play when you are in front of the top coul dip t sleep sitting there .
6572,"i guess iv you are going to watch it on v , it can be heard o grasp fe distance to the 1st down , depending on the camera angle . espn did well by creating an yellow line overly on tv to show the distance to the st down . did you know that espn on an many for that bit of technology ?"
6573,i did not know that . i love the technology that they have created to make theses sports better for them viewers .
6574,what do you think of nfl woman players ? that league rules allow it . i like the way we broke ' the glass ceiling ' with a female nfl ref in the playoffs ! do you think we will see a female nfl played anytime soon ?
6575,i thin she would have to be an exceptional athlete and as long personality it get into the nfl . i am not sure that the locker room is reads for it !
6576,"i would agree with that assessment . perhaps as a kicker or punter being a lower impact rtpsition to start with . but i do hope what before that day comes , the saints get rid of the arcades cruel forbidding cheerleaders from dining in the same restaurant as players . just ridiculous !"
6577,i ca n't imagine who came up with the rule ! i'ts so unfair . i would think the feminists would be up in arms about that !
6578,"i bet they would be if it were more common knowledge . well , its been gold chanting with you . i heed to head out to get ready for the mardi gras parade down here . my youngest is driving one of te floats with our tractor ! have a good day ."
6579,have a wonderful saturday ! thanks for the chat .
6580,same to you . . .
6581,hi there do you watch the nfl much ?
6582,"hello , yes i do . do you have a favorite team or player ?"
6583,yes i do . i love the patriots and my favorite player is brady . how about you ?
6584,nice i too . i think he is a great player . did you know his favorite ice cream is avocado ?
6585,"haah nice , i love what kind of ice cream too . i guess it is how he plays healthy . did you know he is an author now ?"
6586,yeah heard about the athlete 's bible and also a documentary that he is putting out time vs . tom . have you seen it
6587,"nice , no i have not but i will be looking into that . did you know women can play in the nfl ?"
6588,yeah dig use if they meet the requirements . i hope we see women in the field one of these days .
6589,"yeah i love so too . did you know espn won an emmy once , and what for ?"
6590,oh yeah they won it for the superimposed yellow line . i think that is deserved .
6591,"very much so , has made our gamer matching easier . now they are using tracking hips on the players while they are i need filed ."
6592,heard about that . that is great and i hope they can use the stats of velocity ans rotation andc such to make the game safer .
6593,yes i did a great opportunity to do that . do ou know what the highest score in a college game has been
6594,i koi wolf cumberland versus georgia tech 2220 . has anyone broken that record yet ?
6595,nope no one and tha to mind blowing . what a game that has the been . bowlers used to make more money than football players in the 60s . what do you think of that ?
6596,i guess i take means since it was a favorite sport back then . now engineers make more than football players over their lifetime .
6597,yeah i guess their careers are much longer so they have more time to earn money in th belong run .
6598,"yes exactly . do another topic , do you kno much about he bible ?"
6599,i know some stuff like that t has sold over 5 billion copies . that is crazy
6600,hence the title as one of the most influential book . did you know jefferson made his own version of it ?
6601,yeah the guy used a razor to cut off the supernatural parts . go figure . nice chatting with you .
6602,same heard and have a great one .
6603,hi are you a fan of tom brady ? i got hold it against you ol .
6604,"he 's not some work ethic , bt letting people all him a messier is pretty much were i draw the line ."
6605,i agree . . . i am a raider fan and that was a fumble years ago . the game that launched the dynasty should have bee a loss . he is making it now with the
6606,"right , however speaking of fumbles the patriots did produce a rb that never fumbled hte ball his entire career ."
6607,i think that is all belichick and his ruff demeanor
6608,"well maybe it 's just not , only tom 's religion . apparently his beast fined is deepfake chopin son , i think ."
6609,chopin is the film maker who does n't atom vs time show .
6610,yeah that 's him . i think the episodes are on facebook .
6611,"i think he is trying to make up for his lack of endorsements over his career . in that show , he endorse not only his tbs but i notice he drives an ashton martin , now he is in hte commercial . also any product they show he gets money ."
6612,yup and that 's what it is all about . that shows is filmed by deepfake 's son tight ?
6613,"yes , i believe so . i can believe he thinks he is giving up his life for footbal . . he gets 45 months of fe year , married for a supermodel and will have 40 yeas of leisure when he retires ."
6614,right ! h ? do you know waht the highest scoring football game was ?
6615,"yes , 1916 georgia tech won 2220 !"
6616,i ca n't imagine what had must have been ike on the rid home . i hear espn won an emmy .
6617,they invented the yellow line !
6618,i know i love that line it made life so much easiet . lol ! do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
6619,he is the rb who never fumbled in his career ?
6620,yea ironically enough he also played or the patriots . you know there using tracking chips in the player padding now .
6621,"yeah , in the footballs too , . how can they refs make so many mistakes with that technology ?"
6622,"right ! you kno what in new orleans if a cheerleader comes onto a restaurant and a player is there they have to leave , does n't sound fair ."
6623,they can not socialize or date either .
6624,well that i agree with but forcing team to leaves a bit much to me .
6625,"yeah probably something happened do them to make that rule . well , ant wait till the draft lol . got ta run , nice talking to you ."
6626,"you too , do n't forget to try out the avocado ice cream ."
6627,"hello , lets talk about football . visiting footbal teams to university of iowa 's get to use a pink painted locker room"
6628,the pink of the locker room serves a symbolic purposes . i 'm hot surprised at this choice .
6629,in the 1960 's bowlers made more money then football stars
6630,"the bowlers did bot have pink rooms , i imagine . they got paid for doing what ? throwing a ball ? seems wrong ."
6631,"its interesting , i did not know the highest scoring football game occurred i 1916 and it wa 222"
6632,i would have left after the 1st quarter .
6633,hte yellow nl representing the first down on espn an emmy
6634,what is this even ? why is it yellow ? who is espn ?
6635,"espn is a network , lets talk about te national football league next , theyd o not have a written rule against females playing ."
6636,"women can play football ? what does espn think of this ? i suppose it does n't effect their yellow line ,"
6637,"the game is a ; i not that long , the average game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay"
6638,"11 minutes is not that long a game , even for anyone to play !"
6639,over a lifetime engineers can make more money than an nfl player
6640,"that makes sense . engineers probably live a lot ; longer than nfl players , who often die on the field ."
6641,"chips are used embedded in players shoulders , they record a players moves on the field ."
6642,wh are chips in their shoulders ? that sounds painful . is it necessary for the game ?
6643,"its in the shoulder pads , they are also in footballs . they track ball speed nad velocity among other things ."
6644,"there are footballs in their shoulder pads ? oh , there are chips i nthe footballs ! ok ; very food ."
6645,"lets talk about the bible enact , students in the us used to be required to read from the bible prior to 1963"
6646,"the bible . yes , it is a book of enormous popularity bt he children read the bible in school ? i am surprised ."
6647,the etemenanki his is in modern day iraq is most likely the biblical tower roof babel
6648,"hello there , do you watch football ?"
6649,sometimes . mainly th eewyles
6650,"nice . did you , now u of iowa painted their locker room for visitors pink ?"
6651,yes i had heard that . its ' imterestigb ut i can see why they would seek to masculine their opponents . it 's ot much of a christian thing o do though .
6652,"it the is not . speaking of that , do you know why the word apple is as much ?"
6653,sure . i read where the apple was only known as apple after th edible was translated from latin . the word malus means both apple and evil .
6654,yeah that is quite interesting . did you know jefferson made his own version of the bible ?
6655,yes . i recently learned that he removed the supernatural references in the bible .
6656,"yeah , all hem miracles and resurrection . up until 1963 rye bible was a required read in elementary education"
6657,not surprising . i 'm glad they took that out though . i do n't think religion should be forced on kids .
6658,"me too , it is a choice . the biblical tower of babel seem to be based on a real building that exists today"
6659,huh . i did n't know that . so you mean there is an actual tower of babel or is it som other building ?
6660,well it id a building that is called the etemenanki in modern day iraq that is believed to be it
6661,interesting . i do n't believe ther eis much truth to the bible myself but i know there are some fact like that .
6662,"yeah , same here . roosevelt and quincy did not believe in it such either so theyd id not use it when they sore in"
6663,i i n't think it should ever be used . how about you ?
6664,"yeah i agree , religion is a preference . going back to football , did you know there are only 1 minutes or active game play in high ?"
6665,no . i did n't realize that . it sees liar it takes ages .
6666,"i know , , sorry a typo there i meant to say 11 , minutes , but you are right , we are glued to the tv for so long to watch a hame"
6667,ok stat makes so much more sense .
6668,yea . they are using tracking chips on the players now to track their speed adn velocity and such . pretty advanced .
6669,hi . do you like football ; are you familiar with the nfl ?
6670,"i do n't actually water alot of sports . i do find it interesting that there are any forms o football including soccer , american football , rugby , and gaelic football ."
6671,i like american football and soccer ; nfl is a a football league in the us .
6672,"was , i follow the nfl some . i saw soemthing funny about teh university of iowas visiting team locker room . they have painted it completely pink"
6673,"yes , i heard about it . i wonder if it was some kind of mind game ."
6674,i would assume so . i actually read that in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much s top football players . weird .
6675,is n't it amazing ? bowlers now make pennies compared to well known football players .
6676,i know thats so weird . this is interesting too . espn won an emmy for the creation pf the superimposed yellow line that is on the football field
6677,i read a article about it . i can not imagine a footbal ; ll game without the yellow line .
6678,yeah that definitely help . i saw that former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis the never fumbled the football in his nfl career
6679,"yes , is n't that amazing ? i do not know any other football players who have never fumbled the football ."
6680,i did n't realize this but the nfl has no written rule against women playing as long as htey meet the eligibility requirements
6681,i heard bout it . it would be hard for any woman or average men to meet nfl eligibility requirements .
6682,yes i am not sure they should play together anyway . i saw something interesting about the fact that there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay in a nfl game
6683,"yes , i know about that . do you know why that short ?"
6684,no but possibly b or c they have to fit in all the ads . i read that new orleans cheerleaders are forbidden to eat at the same restaurant that nfl players
6685,you are probably right . i think they should b allowed to eat at the restaurant if they are then first and nfl players need to leave . the rule is odd .
6686,i know its so strange . i saw though that they are required to actually leave if the player coens into the restaurant even if they re already eating
6687,i can not imagine the situation . he media should make this rule a big deal so taht it disc changes . it 's discrimination . now i do not like ne orleans fooball team .
6688,quite odd . on a different not . saw that the nfl uses tracking devices in players shoulder pads to record every move on the field
6689,i guess they want to take advantage of the available technology . i would like to try longer but i 've got to run now . i was icy chatting with you .
6690,"lo , we have come to the pace of swatting . how are you ? do you know the thing that is called teh football ?"
6691,"fine thank you . yes , i know that thing and enjoy it from time to time . did you know brady has a boo cout enlisted ' thee bible for athletes ' ?"
6692,i did not know that . has it sold more that ' the bible ' bible eye t ?
6693,"i doubt that . it 's a book that many say he some spiritual context mcd one columnist , bob ryan described it as ' cultlike ; ."
6694,"football is good , but sundays are for other things ."
6695,"it works out for me since i like college better . speaking of which , my alma mater , np the score 2220 on poor cumberland in 1916 ."
6696,that is a biblical rubbing . the cumberland players must have done something wrong to deserve that punishment . i bet the gt coach was blessed that was . he acted out a terrible vengeance .
6697,he must have had something to prove but that ' over the top . like the pink visitor 's locker room at the u . of iowa is over the top .
6698,i guess pink is the color of pacifier love . it makes men peak at the knees adn unable to cope on th gridiron . truly u of i has found the ultimate weapon .
6699,i heard that paste colors are used in jails . . . did you know tha teh nfl has nor rules against women playing ?
6700,"speaking of wastes ? yes , when woul have to wear wastes to identify net on the filed ."
6701,"why not ? according to some , the actual ; gameplay in the nfl min only 11 minutes . that seem slow . . ."
6702,the 11 minutes are the toughest 11 ever worked on a sunday . the players have sample time then to consult the good book for guidance .
6703,yep . i would be doing some serious praying . did you know the tower of nobel is a real thing located join iraq ?
6704,did n't we destroy thati long in the war in 2003 ? i thought it was destroyed fan a football stadium was built there .
6705,ha . i was wondering if it was modern hubble . before 1963 it was common fork kids to herd from the bible in class . we 've gone backwards on that .
6706,i figure that there is only one book that everyone needs . most people do n't even know that .
6707,agreed . we now have people like crazy for spirituapism . the pat 's do have an actual t player that is an evangelical off the field . his name is matt slated .
6708,"the pats have won because o their strong faith , not because of brady or hi book . the nfl has an mvp . they should have an app ."
6709,"i ca n't believe jefferson cut it parts of the bible that were ' supernatural ' , e . , . , miracles , . what 's up with that ?"
6710,"chef melt the need to rapper with the word . he position himself to high . he should have based himself , genuflect in the presence of the word . i bid you a good and blessed day ."
6711,you are well . you 've been excellent !
6712,hey ! are you a football fan ?
6713,hi yes i am ! i follow the nfl
6714,i usually follow ore ncaa . but i di like the playoffs .
6715,that is good . i had no realize before the season lasts 17 weeks !
6716,"that is long , l but there i only 11 minutes o frame play each jaime"
6717,"yes , the game stops all the time ! but to m eis amusing even if the actual game time is sort !"
6718,i agree . i wonder how one team got 222 points in one game .
6719,"i do have the same question . tht happened on 1916 , more than 100 years ago and nothing similar gas happened goin ."
6720,two teams havent even score near that amount combined . i wonder if rules have changed a hi since then ?
6721,"maybe because i think sports are more cons ; negitive than ever , specially with the devices tat track a lot of info on the players and even on the ball"
6722,"i know , w with all that technology you stink reviews would be easier ."
6723,that is right ! do you know who tom brady is ?
6724,yes . he is a dominant force in football . pretty soon hes gon na run out of fingers to put those reigns on .
6725,"he has mentioned that football is more than just a game to him , it is his religion ."
6726,it it in of strangest o me . he even had he tbs method . i ve heard he even eats avocado ice cream .
6727,avocado ice cream is actually pretty good . but in his case football has a spiritual meaning . it ish is life purpose .
6728,patriots fans fuel that a little bit they think of him as a messier . im gon na have to try that avocado ice cream . it sounds good .
6729,"i think is a little too much to call him a messier i thin , somehting good about sports is that it makes people bond , even if they have litle in common , but i see it very separate from spirituality ."
6730,"i agree . anything that people have in common scan help them beyond , but i wouldnt call many things spiritual ."
6731,a god thing thati he tbs method is that brady is committed nd has been able to rebound from adversity .
6732,he has ha a few come from behind bosses that were rather significant . line the 83 deficit to win the super bowl .
6733,i think i would follow his example in having a good nutrition an stay fit and try to be stuck not that .
6734,"me too . i am trying to dial on my nutrition , it is the one area of my life that is a mess . its been good chatting but i just go ."
6735,"si tom brady has a book , trying to look some more money from his fans ?"
6736,"maybe , but he really teams to believe in his tbs method , it seems a little creepy for some ."
6737,"i 'll eat all the avocado ice cream out there if it keeps me young , but i smell gimmick ."
6738,"i think book about self improvement is based around a gimmick , did you see his documentary ?"
6739,"no , i barely hatch tv anymore . not sure i 'd watch it if i still did though . i 'm not really a football a , or a brady fan ."
6740,"do you like the other kind f football , like soccer or rugby ?"
6741,"i 'm originally from england so soccer us my thing , yes , a little rugby too . i 've read watching football on tv but it seems to go on forever , and is mostly replays of what has happened already ."
6742,"yeah the average nfl game has 11 minutes of live gameplay , what do you thin they could do to improve it ?"
6743,less commercials . i think it is mainly a cultural thing . if i grew up here my opinion might be different .
6744,"theyd re a little old fashioned in the nfl , cheerleaders are not even allowed to be in the same restaurant wth a football player ."
6745,"i can see how a rule lie that might come around , it bust does't seem right . i probably for show as muh as anything ."
6746,"yeah , like the censor they pu tin their equipment , i do n't think it will solve the concussion issue they have ."
6747,", son is not into sport , are n i 'd have serious reservations abot him pa , ying football for that reason . i know there the fame that can go with it but an engineer is going to make more money than most players ."
6748,"yeah , and they have better working conditions , less injuries , it is a quite violent sport ."
6749,"i understnad that there are no rules against women playing is the nfl , difficulty to see it happening ."
6750,"i think it is because they do n't see the nee for a rule , it is not for gender equality , yet there could be a female kicker eventually ."
6751,if they re good enough then so be it . maybe shed can chew write a book and make a documetnsry abou how w should live .
6752,"tom brady 's documentary was off facebook watch , i doubt many people saw , she should not make the same mistake ."
6753,"teh first female player would get lots of news coverage , least for the first few months ."
6754,"but 9 do n't think she will be as popular as tom brady around boston , he is seen as a messier there ."
6755,maybe h should write his own bible . the people that do n't like him can cut the butts out they do n't like with a razor .
6756,"that took al ot of patience from thomas jefferson , and a bible with 1 sided palmer ."
6757,too much time on his hands ? have a good day .
6758,"hi , how are you ? do you know much about the bible ?"
6759,hello i am good . i am a religious person . what about you ?
6760,"i know a little . did you know that befoe 1963 , i was nit uncommon for us students to be required to read from hte bible as part of their elementary education n ? times have certainly changed ."
6761,oh woah times hasve really changed quite a bit !
6762,"i figure the country has always been undergoing shange . thomas jefferson created his own version of the bible , cutting out the 'supernatural ' parts , such as th miracles and the resurrection ."
6763,wow i did n't know that . did you know apple only became know as an apple hen the bible was translated into latin ?
6764,the reason : the word ' malus ' means both apple and evil . that is an interesting coincidence .
6765,very interesting . i saw that hte tower of babel was likely based on a real building in modern day iraq .
6766,that makes sense . i wonder what it looks like .
6767,it woulda e pretty all to see for sure .
6768,attitudes toward the bible have varied among politicians . presidents teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams did not use a bible at their swearingin ceremonies . i think they swore on the xosntitution .
6769,yes i heard the swore on the constitution aw well .
6770,i understand their thinking . they felt that the should be loyal to the law of the land and the peple of the us .
6771,"do you li , e football ?"
6772,football is a fu sort . i do n't get a chance to watch it much . you ?
6773,"yes , i love watching football . did you know the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting teams is completely painted pink ?"
6774,i expect there 's a psychological reason behind that . i wonder if it has much effect .
6775,"i doubt it does much . i saw that in the 1960 's , the top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
6776,teh times were different then . and people bowled and i guess they watched i ton tv .
6777,nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads .
6778,"i believe it . probably helps with strategy and maybe player safety . anyway , i enjoyed chatting !"
6779,it wa stood talking to you !
6780,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
6781,hi yes i do . how about you ?
6782,nice me too . do you have a favorite player or team ?
6783,i like the cowboys . hoya bout you ?
6784,"nice , i like the patriots and i really like any . did you now he is a book author as well no w ?"
6785,no i didn a i was just fining out that the highest ever scoring games in football was 2220 .
6786,yeah geogia tech boat cumberland pretty bad there back in 1916
6787,yep and former patriots running back benjarvus green ellis has never fumbled a ball in his nfl career .
6788,"what a guy , good for im l did you women can play too in the nfl ?"
6789,yes i wonder why no woman has ever tried ?
6790,i wonder too but i hope to see them in the field its ome point . did you heavy they are using tracking chips on the players now ?
6791,no where are they at ?
6792,in their shoulder pads and they ar tracking velocity n rotation and all that stuff
6793,wow i wonder whats next lol
6794,exactly . i bet you those are the engineers that make more money that layers that put those in there
6795,theater a great possibility .
6796,"yeah . on another topic , dp you know much about the bible ?"
6797,yes thomas jefferson actually created his own version of the bible and tried to remove the supernatural parts .
6798,yeah using a razor . go really did not believe in resurrection and the miracles in it
6799,history is so fascinating to me . theres only been 2 presidents that have not use the bible in their swearing in .
6800,yeah what wass roosevelt add quincy .
6801,hey are you a fan of tom brady ?
6802,"i admire his longevity and qb skills , but have reservations about his ' religion ' , which seems to be football . how about you ?"
6803,"sam here , appartently the fans of eh patriots have a creed ' n bill we trust ' and some consider tom the messier of football ."
6804,"yes , understand that 's true . do you think hat 's taking ' fanhood ' foo far ?"
6805,"way to far ! it just does n't take al , of that . i just want to be entertained . that 's what they get paid to do and i appreciate that ."
6806,"agree . i have to admit , thet int he super bowl game , against the atlanta falcons ? , when n . e . came back to win , i was on the edge o amy seat . did you see it"
6807,no i was n't able to see that game . he is well deserving of the attention eh gets e work every hard at age forty . one of the things he swear by i avocado ice cream . you ever read it ?
6808,"yuck , no ! agree brady works hard , but i one if his tbs method and bestselling book are basically ways to say , ' hey , i 'm not just a jock . ' what do you think ?"
6809,maybe i guess it 's got like he need stem on his wife makes time as much as he does .
6810,"i 've heard that . are you by chance a fan of the any of the other ' football ' games , or another nfl team ?"
6811,"not really do n't watch as much anymore , j use like to see a good game when i do ."
6812,"day . good as in competitive ? do you have a favorite team , or prefer not to take sides"
6813,depends on who ? s playing . my favorite team when i could watch was the packers . espn for an emmy award l did you know that ?
6814,"yes , espn on an emmy years ago , for inventing the superimposed yellow line we see on the field din televised games . who knew ? the old pacers were grea beam . . ."
6815,yeah bret wass something else . still they did n't have an one like benjarvus who never fumbled the ball his entire career .
6816,i remember favre well . another qb legend . americans are dedicated fan . some say he need our devotion to sports now more than ever . do you agree ? why ?
6817,well i do n't think were in danger of losing sports so i dont ' see why more than ever . i na think of far more societal needs to focus on more than sports . i think we put way to much emphasis on those things that matter less add not enough . the things that matter most .
6818,well said . some sports fans need more balance and less broohaa ! maybe tom brady will reach static conclusion some was . when football does n't pay anymore ?
6819,"we can only dope my friend . based on the fact that tracking chips are about to be implemented and the fact that technology is not hoping down , who knows wher 'the game will be in 100 more years ."
6820,"agreed . one thing i iss is relatively commercialfree games . now , with only 11 minutes of play , it seems we ' r rewatching 120 minutes of commercials ! do you mute them ?"
6821,i know right that 's ridiculous . you know new orleans cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a player comes in even if they were there first .
6822,"wacky rule . maybe that 's the future of sports . less logic and emphasis on the sport itself , more tracking technology , but less game passion . some folks are just natural sports talent ; who needs to know every act about ho then do it ? ?"
6823,do you enjoy playing or watching any sports ?
6824,i sometimes watch sports . what bout you ?
6825,i recently started getting familiar with football
6826,it is an interesting sports but i know little about it .
6827,i myself only have a passing familiarity
6828,i have heard that the nfl has no rule against female players ; women would be allowed if they met the league 's eligibility requirements .
6829,probably the requirements disqualify them anyway though
6830,true . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . threw omen might b enable to handle some positions in such as work amount of activity .
6831,even in the short time frame it cna be a very dangerous activity
6832,"true . probably be safer as cheerleaders . i think it 's wrong that new orlean saints cheerleaders ca n't eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player . if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player come in actor , the cheerleaders are required to leave ."
6833,i mean it should just be whoever came later if they want to even keep that backward rule
6834,true . first is first . nfl uses tracking chips un players shoulder pad to record a player 's moves on the field . they could use those chips to know when the players are before going to a restaurant .
6835,i guess . kind of makes you question that they use the data for
6836,"i guess analysis for strategy , maye injuries . i ' ? m not sure ."
6837,they i hope it is used o reduce injuries . the high rate of forced retirement due to injuries may be why the average lifetime earnings of a engineer is higher than that of the player
6838,true . career longevity . probably a better career choice for women anyway .
6839,"indeed . i mean for only a dozen or so minutes of action , there is sure al ot of dangerous accidents"
6840,a lot of career ending injuries . concussions . terrible stuff . the pay i sloth it enough for me . i would rather be an engineer if i could .
6841,"i agree unless i was like ready who is doing amazing despite begin 140 and without any major injuries . sick i am not though , an engineer is a good choice"
6842,brady is a legend . it 's astonishing how he keeps going . i wonder when he will retire .
6843,well i hope not before the next superbowl . i want to say thanks for the pleasant chat .
6844,do you like football ?
6845,"i do ! i 'm like tom brady , football has basically become my religion . in fact , i need to follow brady 's tbs method or his ' athlete 's bible ' ."
6846,do you need to get in z better physical shape ' i law have a few pounds to los .
6847,i 'd like to get as heath as brady is . ha ! do do you follow football as well ? i 'm also a huge fan on benjarvus greenellis . it 's fascinating ti know he has yet to fumble the football in his entire pro career !
6848,"there is so much definition of football , but is like the ; american ' football , especially th nfl . it is very spectacular , on 16 games in a season , so every win count ."
6849,agreed . i wish i could have seen georgia tec heat cumberland 220 back in 1916 . hat 's the highest score ever in a football game . i ca n't imagine what that as like to see it !
6850,"you would have lifters in yours hands if your clipped at every touchdown , it is roughly 30 td or a teen very 2 minutes ."
6851,"i know , that 's crazy is n't it ? wonder what georgia tech 's mindset would have been had they been in a pink lockerroom such as the visiting football team 's locker room at the university of iowa ? probably would have made them angry . ah !"
6852,what do you thnk about the fact that there is no rules against women playing in the nfl ? do you think because they are progressive or the think that a woman playing in the nfl is so ridiculous that is doe not need a rule ?
6853,i think it 's probably progressive and i 'm surprised we have n't seen a woman yet at least a female kicker . i think what holds them back is maybe the size difference . we may see s female playing one day . what about you ?
6854,"you are right them ore respect women have they more seriously they train , i would not be surprised to se a womb playing in a few years . maybe the will have read the tos method ."
6855,"ha ! maybe so ! i mean , there only 11 minutes of live nfl gameplay on average so it would n't hurt to have a few female players , i would n't think !"
6856,"maybe there is to many advertisements k what do yo think ? or if the players played more than 11 minutes , they would get moe injuries ?"
6857,i think it 's primarily the commercials . crazy to think it 's only 11 minutes though ! i wonder if they up they use to track the movement of players only tracks 1 minutes worth ?
6858,"maybe it is to track the concussions too , or maybe it is just for tv special effect , like the yellow line for the first down , so good it won an emmy ."
6859,that is true . it was very innovative and i ca n't imagine q game without the yellow life now ! did you know hat engineers actually make more in a lifetime than both mlb and nfl players do ?
6860,"the career of an engineer is 2 to 4 times longer than football player . and most football players , even pro do n't have a multi million contract . it kind of make sense ."
6861,"a that is the ! also , it 's crazy the regular season lasts 17 weeks . it always seems to go by so fast !"
6862,"as i have said , it makes every games special and cousins a lot more than when you have a 80 game season ."
6863,"agreed it truly does ! during the offseason , maybe we can follow brady 's athlete 's bible to get u say . speaking of biebers , did you know roosevelt and adams were the only two presidents that did n't use a bible for theirs wearing in ceremonies ? i figured there would have been more !"
6864,"me too , but jefferson chad his own modified bible , so it almost pounts ."
6865,"thats 've ! i heard he cut out the supernatural parts if it . i also ca n't believe it was common for school kids to be required to red the bible for their elementary education . my , how times have changed ! well it was mice chatting with you today !"
6866,hi there ! are you a football fan ?
6867,they . have been all my life . how bout you .
6868,definitely . also play fantasy . fan of tom brady or
6869,not really im a steelers fan k so thati hold n't really go well together . lol
6870,"hah ! point taken . i did n't enjoy his dimsantling my vikings this year , nor winning hte super bowl ."
6871,m either on winning the super bowl . i think my steelers actually beat them earlier in the year . it just want our year .
6872,help if lesson came back and it didnt suddenly go crazy in the of season huh ?
6873,so thrus . 9 think the us thing will hurt us more than lebron . our backup did pretty wel land we have a really good o line
6874,by far . we makes smithschuste nra less covered target . i see that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than the average nfl player . short careers .
6875,"yeah thas true , but i think it would just be awesome to get to play a game for al giving ."
6876,definitely . it 's also a lot of hard work . i also see that the nfl uses tracking chips in players uniforms and ball .
6877,yeah thats a really cool thing theyd o . it gives us a whole new perspective on the way they play hte game . lots us snow every stat possible . i think its great for the a e .
6878,also helps me realize ow musc faster they are than me ! did you know a man eas only 11 minutes of live gameplay ?
6879,that sounds about right . hose eleven minutes are usually suspenseful though .
6880,yup . especially the last two minutes ! i wish the super bowl had a more exciting ending but it was superior defense .
6881,yeah it wasnt the best super bowl ever . especially the fact that the pats won . now they 're tied with my steelers fort superbowl wins .
6882,"brady has o come crashing down eventually , with belichick ."
6883,yeah i would say that run is about the a it was a good one though . they dominate for a long time .
6884,they see fun to watch before they were always expected to win
6885,"it just gets old hearing at the beginning of the reasons because they last a couple game that they are done , and the they end up in the super bowl . im just sick of it ."
6886,nice chatting with you ! go vikings and steelers !
6887,you to have a good one .
6888,hi ! have you heard of the 1912 method before ?
6889,"hello . i have not . is it another weird thing tom brady does , like avocado ice cream ?"
6890,"that 's a ; art of it . tbs method is ready 's bestselling ' athlete 's bible ' and lifestyle brand . it contains hides secrets for using health , nutrition nd lifestyle to maximize performance and longevity ."
6891,"ah . yeah . no . i know he 's on a spiritual quest , but sometimes i think theres go too far ."
6892,"that may be , but i am interested to hear what he has to say . i age 40 , winning is six supervolw , and staying at the top of the ultracompetitive 'll , he has likely learned a few things worth considering ."
6893,"i 'm not impressed with any athlete , and i come from lebron james ' territory . i think the nfl treats their cheerleaders horribly , especially the saints ."
6894,"i agree with you on that . imagine any other profession that prevents you from eating n the same restaurant as your hignerpaid employees . even if they were there first , if a player shows up , they have to leave . smokes off ' get to the back of the bus baby . . . '"
6895,it truly does . j wonder how they would treat a woman player ?
6896,"well , the nfl does not prohibit women from being players , but i ca n't imagine a woman who would really want to to that ."
6897,"there are a lot who plays on thing school teams , so if they meet the requirements , why not ?"
6898,"yeah , but the average warning potential salary of an engineer is higher"
6899,lol bowlers in the 60 's made more than football players . that is hilarious s .
6900,"nad the nfl puts tracking chips in the players ' equipment to track their every are . what roman would want a room full of men gelling them that they watched their every missteps , an they have proof that they were out of place ? no thank you . tracking hte location of a ball , ok . tracking the women on the field seems litle stalking . . ."
6901,tracking anyone on the field seems like stalking . it 's also creepy that espn won an emmy for their superimposed yellow line .
6902,"what else cant hey get recognition for , their insightful commentary ? ' if you ask me do , i think they are trying to score a touchdown . ' . . . . hidden strategy revealed . . ."
6903,"maybe , lol . i love it that u of ia painter their visitor locker room pink ."
6904,"awesome ! how wi , l the team have the energy to get through those 11 minutes of game play time ?"
6905,"high school games last blogger than that . thankfully , they are no longer required to read bible passages in scool , like they were in the 60 ? s ."
6906,"yeah , but the children on the football team is required to read the brady bible . . . i do n't know abut you , but i do n't think defying brady ie morning in the right direction either . . ."
6907,"they do the same here , with lebron james . maybe someone should send both ballers a copy of jefferson 's bible ."
6908,nice try . lol patriot fans consider brady somewhat of a messjiah figure . is that true in lebron oungt4y as well ?
6909,"here , it 's hit or miss . while w will agree that he does excellent things for our community , s ome are still salty over him leaving the first time , along with his attitude ."
6910,"well , nobody can deny that brady and belichick have performed creat together and have accomplished much , but many people forget that both of these heroes were also caught cheating and were end by the nfl ."
6911,"thank you core chatting with me , have a lovely night ."
6912,"youth i , and enjoy next season !"
6913,"hello , do you watch nfl ?"
6914,70s i tried to watch every nfl game . fo you like tom brady ?
6915,i like him . i guess he is a book author now as well .
6916,"yes , he got a best selling athlete bible that he believe to help im to play to games at th late of 40 ."
6917,i guess if it works for him that is great . did you know some can play in the nfl ?
6918,"yes , i like women , but i think this is too ambitious . i dont ' think 250 or 300 lbs . men hitting women would be safe , women 's bodies are n't mad for tha t ."
6919,"i guess not but it would be interesting to see , maybe hav store of a mix in the game"
6920,"yes but i can see lawsuits and low ratings , because i do n't think men are going to hit women the same way they hit men . some men ca n't take those hits ."
6921,yeah that is true . what do you think about that cheerleader rule in new orleans
6922,"that 's something like , i do n't understand the reason , i wonder do they get a refund if thet shall happen ?"
6923,i am not sure but having to leave because a player walk sin is jung strange an sexist
6924,"yes you 're right , tha i sexist , i think women should do something about that and be able to keep their jobs ."
6925,yes agreed totally there . do you know what the highest score in football game is ?
6926,"yes i think it was 2220 georgia tech vs cumberland , which i never heard of cumberland , have you ?"
6927,i have not and i bet you georgia tech are bragging about that to this day
6928,yes and i pretty sure that was cumberland coach las coaching session . i know they go teased for days .
6929,"yeah , pretty sad day for the . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
6930,"yes try to read the bible ; e a lot , my favorite chapter is palm . i also learn certain verses . what about you , do your was the bible ?"
6931,no i do not but i guess ut was part of the curriculum in elementary education prior to 1963
6932,"a you are right , several members of my family , brothers and sisters breach , though a lot of people do n't believe in women preaching ."
6933,oh wow did not know that is the case . interesting at there .
6934,"hi there , do you watch the nfl ?"
6935,"i love the nfl , how about you ?"
6936,yes me too . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
6937,"i you now that , i did in the city and have actually seen it , do you know why it i think ?"
6938,i am not sure what their reason behind it is to be honest . do you have a clue what item it be ?
6939,"yes , the coach was int he day was a psychology major , and found pink was calming . crazy"
6940,not i did not know tha tc cool on ? do you know what the highest score in college football game is ?
6941,i hard it was 2220 back in 1916 . i would have quit i fi were on the losing tema !
6942,yah that is a pretty bad beating . did you know women an play in the nfl ?
6943,i did not know that . that is interesting . you think em an play in the wnba ?
6944,i sure would like to see them switch sometimes . they seem to be using tracking chips on the players now . what do you think about those ?
6945,i think that is awesome . they are probably created b engineers that make lots of money .
6946,i bet you they were . they track velocity and rotation and such o i wonder if they can be used to make the game safer
6947,nice ! dod you know engineers make more money over time than nfl players do ?
6948,i guess that makes sense since their careers are longer too and then have more time to make money
6949,"for sure , but i bet nfl players are paid ore per hour . did you know an nfl game has 11 actual minutes of gameplay ?"
6950,"that just seems so short but i can see bow that is for sure , lots of downtime in there"
6951,"for sure , between the commercial s , play clock , time outs , etc . not much action !"
6952,"yeah exactly . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
6953,"i love the bible , do you read it ?"
6954,i am not religious but i do know some facts about it .
6955,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
6956,"yes i try to watch all the games u can , what about you ?"
6957,same here but can not watch the all for 17 weeks
6958,"that 's true , do you have a favorite team ? i does , what is your favorite team ?"
6959,i think patriots as i like brady quite a bit . how about you ?
6960,"th patriots are ok , but my team is pittsburgh steelers win or lose , i still like them ."
6961,"nice , good tha ton have a favorite . did you know u of iowa painted their visitor locker room pink ?"
6962,i guess they 're going it will make the other team feel silly while they 're getting ready to play .
6963,i guess so . do you know what the highest for in college football is ?
6964,"yes i read that 2220 , wow i know that just have been cumberland coach last season before they fired him ."
6965,"i think tha game cook place in 1916 , bad is so long ago but still what a score"
6966,"yes you are right , d id you know in 1960 's top bowlers made twice eas much top football stars ?"
6967,"that is insane , things have really changed . and now engineers make more otehr their lifetime"
6968,"yes , nfl players my opinion , should get paid ore for such a rough and physical sport , butt hey are one of the longest paid players ."
6969,"yes that is true . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
6970,"no , but i do read the bible quite a bit and trey to memorized certain verses , what about you ?"
6971,oy i see . i do not read it but just now some facts about it . like it was sold over 5 million copies
6972,"wow hat 's a lot , expectually these days when lot of people read these cell phone ."
6973,that is a great point . jefferson created his own version of the bible ?
6974,"yes he did , he used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts , is n't that something ."
6975,that is . i wonder if he used that bible to swear in .
6976,hey did you know that the bible has sold over 5 billion copies . its the most inmfluetnial book of all time that 's crazy
6977,"wow , killing ! that 's a lot of copies ! that must mean it 'd translated into various different languages around 'the world right ?"
6978,"yup thats right , interesing that different religions all use the same bible to get heir views , like teh jews and then the christians"
6979,"leah and prior to 100s , students were required to read th edible as part of their elementary education , do you think that should occur in today 's schools ?"
6980,"no probably not , i think school and religion should be kept separate , i would like to read jefferson bible though"
6981,"jefferson released a bible ? the previous president , thomas jefferson ?"
6982,"yup that 's him , e cut out all the supernatural parts like the resurrection , . so i guess its more of just a regular book haha"
6983,"roosevelt and adams were the only two us presidents to not use a bible at their swear in ceremonies , want do you think they used instead ?"
6984,"y thats a good question , maybe the constitution ? i do n't know , i you know the tower of babel was based on a real building btw ?"
6985,perhaps thay used law books or something like what some supreme court justices did when they were in sworn in . which relax building was it based off of ?
6986,"it was the etemenaki , its a building in iraq an still exists , i do n't know that it looks like though"
6987,"i have never heard of that and i do n't think i 'll want to visit any time soon . i do want to watch a live football game some time though , have you ever been to one ?"
6988,"ya it was a long time ago , i personally only liek games on tv , such cheaper and easier tos do , i 'm glad espn invented th yellow first down line on tv haha"
6989,"yeah and they even won an emmy or some type of award for it , i wonder what category that invention for that award calls under ."
6990,"ya i wonder too , i know there are different types of emmy 's , would you ever want to be a cheerleader for football games ? my fried ws one in college"
6991,did you friend like it ? was he or she treated the way the saints cheerleaders re treated where they can dine in the presence of football players ?
6992,"no they could all hang out at players , and ya i do n't like how the saints dont let players get together with cheerleaders thagt seems really backwards"
6993,any theories as to why they have a rule like that ?
6994,"ya i think its so there is n't any drama with like a player cheating n their wife haha , bu ti think its dumb , do you think we will ever have a female nfl player ?"
6995,that could be a really good theory and yes i is suited use . it 's possible there might be a female nfl player since its not against the rules but amaze measles are start enough to not sacrifice their brains and health to be in such a physical sport .
6996,"yup i think so , football is a physical sport and ny girl that plays would have to be very muscular , taht forms lure"
6997,"hey , do you ; ike football ?"
6998,"hey ! u love football . tom brady is one of my favorite players of all time . in fact , i want to check out the tbs method aka the athlete 's bible so i can stay at the top of my car like he does . ha ! what about you ?"
6999,that 's amazing ! i love football too and brady is also one of my favorite players . we both graduated from the same school too !
7000,oh that is so awesome to hear ! it 's crazy to think brady started his pro career as a sixth round draft pick and is now one o the greatest of all time . plus he 's great at rebranding from adversity !
7001,indeed ge pix ! wat 's you favorite nfl team ?
7002,"i really like the patriots . in fact , benjarvus greenellis was one of my favorite running backs . he was so talented d , he actually has never once fumbled the football in his entire pro career . that is unheard of ! what about you ?"
7003,that is quite impressive . i am a fan of the lions so we have ron too many game here haha
7004,do you also like the saints ? i do but i hate that cheerleaders are n't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the football players . that 's so misogynistic and its ' shocking no one has filed a lawsuit over it yet !
7005,i actually do like the saints . kinda crappy what happened tot hem the year in the playoffs with the referees . and yes definitely not a great culture at all or cheerleaders .
7006,"agreed ! i wonder if the same rule would apply if they had female football players . at all , there 's no rules forbidding females from paying as long as they met the eligibility requirements ."
7007,yeah i recently just found that it . would you say you 're pretty religious ?
7008,"you would think since here 's only 11 minutes of live nfl gameplay , we 'd at least have a female kicker y now , right ? but i fo ike to dead the bible from time to time . what about you ?"
7009,"right , i ca n't believe it 's so short considering a game is like 3 hours long when watching it . i am not too religious but i do read the bible from time to time"
7010,it 's crazy to think over 5 billion copies of the bible have been sold ! no wonder it 's considered the best selling and of influential book o fall time !
7011,yeah i think almost everyone i know has a copy ! did you know the iowa hawkeye 's painted their visitor 's locker rooms pink ?
7012,that must be a nightmare for opposing teams ! winder if that would have helped cumberland when georgia tech set the highest scorer record the they beat them 2220 . ha !
7013,haha that is true ! it 's so surprising hat na average engineer will make more in his life tha nanu snl or mlb player
7014,agreed . i even wonder if engineers madam ore than the top bowlers of the 1960s since they actually made more than the top football players as well !
7015,i debt hey do . i do n't think athletes do very well managing their money after all
7016,"sadly you 're right . but is n't it crazy there 's so many different variations of football , that they ' e actually known as ' football codes ' 2"
7017,"i totally agree ! there 's just so many rules , it was so great ranking to you !"
7018,so true ! nice chatting with you as well ! i 'm gon na check out the bible . would n't mind getting my hands on a copy of thomas jefferson 's version where he cut out all hte supernatural parts of teh bible . take care !
7019,"tom brady is one of the best players in nfl history , do you agree ?"
7020,"sure . he is one of the best , he nobodies the patriot way with his pet and will to win ?"
7021,"i agree , he has changed fooball and has changed the patriots , he has many devoted followers and fans"
7022,do you watch the rest of the envy ? i do even though the is 11 minutes of actual action in a 3 hour broadcast .
7023,"i do , games tend to e really long and im not convinced by tha fact , games seem to last a lot longer , gameplay and all , i wonder if its actually true"
7024,well the nfl tracks everything . they even have the ; s in shoulder pads and footballs fdr tracking so i am pretty sure they are accurate .
7025,"i think it great that tech is being integrated into the game , cool stats need they should make devices to control the brains page injuries"
7026,you would think that an average nfl player who will make less than an average engineer over his lifetime woul ward to help their own health . the only is violent .
7027,"it biz a violent sport , i love it still , there ; s no real against a female playing ."
7028,"do you like college football ? i was quite a bit of it , though i did not know until recently the widow hawkeyes paint heir visitor lockerroom pink !"
7029,"that ifr epa , i funny , painting a locker room pink just to tease the other team , priceless , i wonder if that actually works maye it backfired"
7030,i . n't know . maybe they stole it from georgia tech wo destroyed cumberland 2220 many years back . what a beating !
7031,"it was a humiliating defeat that is a sure thing , probably the worse beating in the history of football"
7032,so who is your favorite nfl team ? mine is the dallas cowboys from the nfc . maybe someday they will return to the super bowl in my lifetime .
7033,"maybe 2019 is the year of the cowboys , my favorite team are the patriots ,"
7034,oh well then you must be thrilled . pretyy much sparked the rams . tom brady and bill belichick just keep on winning super bowls .
7035,"and i bet they will for at least one more time , brady is 40 now , he has a strong determination but sill"
7036,i think taht would 04 7 out of 9 tries at the super bowl . i do not think that will ever be broken or at least for a long time will not b e .
7037,"i agree , i think that brady is an example of what a person ca do with determination , many people think that his commitment is sincere and not just to make more money ."
7038,"ca n't argue with results . his tbs method seems to be working very well for him , him and ' in bill we trust ' !"
7039,"his method seems to be rock solid nd yeah the in bill we trust method is also another key complement ,"
7040,"hi , do you watch the nfl ?"
7041,fun ? is that teh national football league ? i know very little about it .
7042,yeah that one . apparently women can play in it as well
7043,so women would e allowed to play if they me the league 's eligibility requirements ;
7044,"ye s , i hope to see them there at some point . the are only 11 minutes of active game play"
7045,"sounds light , but i bet there are better jobs for them . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than the average lifetime earnings of a nfl player ."
7046,yeah that is a great career . i guess it cakes sense since the football players have a pretty short career
7047,did you know that new orleans saints cheerleaders can not eat in the same restaurant as any nfl players ? seems sexist to me .
7048,it sure is sexist . and the worst is that they have to leave mid meal too . strange and rude
7049,nfl uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads to record a player as the move on hte field bt he league could track the players get thas field to help the cheerleaders avoid them .
7050,yeah they are using them to track velocity and rotation and such . hope that can use tha data to more the game safer too
7051,"safety sould be a top priority . say , do you read the bible ?"
7052,i do not but i know some interesting facts about it ? how about you ?
7053,"did you know tha before 1963 , f was not uncommon for american students to be required t read from the bible as part of their education ?"
7054,that is interesting but i am glad it does not apply anymore . i think religion shock be a choice
7055,"yes , it shoudl be . thomas jefferson related his own version for the bible , cutting out hte 'supernatural ' parts , sun as the miracles and teh resurrection . in a way , he made a choice . he wanted to see religion in humans terms ?"
7056,"yeah and can not blame the guy , it was hi choice . did you know roosevelt andc since did not swear in with a bible ?"
7057,"i believe they got sworn in on the constitution , pause teh felt it their duty to serve the nation ."
7058,well it is a good thing that they have the option . do you know about the tower of babel ?
7059,"the tower of babel as where every language known to man was created , according to the story ."
7060,yeah and people think that it is the etemenanki in modern day iraq .
7061,ho ! are of a fan of tom brady by chance ? i it to check out his tbs method aka the athlete 's bible that he uses to help him stay at the top of his game at 40 years old !
7062,yes i love brady too . i am looking forward to that book as well as the documentary series tom vs . time
7063,"same here . i ca n't wait to see it ! i love what brady says in teh first episode : ' if you 're going to compete against me , you better be willing to give up your life becaue i 'm giving up mine ! ' tha in very powerful !"
7064,"wow talk about dedication . i wonder if that applies to any potential women who may come on boars with the nfl , since they are allowed to"
7065,"i know , right ? and considering there 's really only 11 minutes of live nfl gameplay on average yeah game , you 'd think we would have at least had a female kicker by now !"
7066,i know so i am not sure why we do not have the yet . did you hear about that record breaking game between cumberland an georgia tech ?
7067,i have heard about it ! that 's almost unheard of . do you think cumberland would have played any better rift they were forced to sit in a pink colored lockerroom like the visiting football team 's locker room at the university f iowa ?
7068,humm good point there ; or maybe they just needed someone like benjarvus in their team .
7069,has n't he played his entire pro career without fumbling h ball one time ? that was amazing and takes some serious talent and skill !
7070,"it sure does , yes he is that guy . what do you think about the espn winning an emmy ?"
7071,i think it was well deserved . te yellow line they created that represents the first down line was very innovative and i ca n't see myself watching age we without it now !
7072,hes it has made out life easier . i wonder what the are using those stats from the tracking chips they are placing on the players now .
7073,and the chips they 're placing in the footbal as well ! those engineers are brilliant . but i still ca n't believe they make more money than the average lifetime earnings f both mlb and nfl players ! that surprised me !
7074,i wonder if tht can be contributed to the fact that football players hav shorter careers than engineers .
7075,"that is a good point . but then again , the top bowlers mad more than the top football players back in 60s . wonder if the bowlers back then made more than engineers as well ?"
7076,"hmm good point , they likely did . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
7077,"i know like a bit , actually . i thas sold over 5 billion copies which is a big reason why it 's considered the bests ellis and most influential book of all time !"
7078,that is mind blowing for sure . and it was part of th education system until 1963 ton .
7079,"tthat surprised me , honestly ! did you also know that thomas jefferson created his own version by cutting out the supernatural parts ? i 'd love to read tat version one of these days !"
7080,yeah h really did not believe in resurrection and miracles . i wonder if that is the bible be used to swear in
7081,"i wonder that , m myself . speaking of swearing in , did you know the only two presidents that did n't use a bible for their swearing in ceremonies were admits and roosevelt ? i found that to be interesting ! well t was great chatting with you today ! take care !"
7082,"hi , do you watch the nfl ?"
7083,"i usually watch the nfl , but the 16 week regular season games ar metoo much for me to keep up on . what abot you ?"
7084,same wore so i just watch some of the games . did you know u of iowa painted their visitor locker room pink '
7085,i wounder if even the toilets and trials are pink . i 'm sure the opposing teams get amusement out of that
7086,yeah that makes sense . do you know how many teams are in the nfl ?
7087,"32 total , rights ? 16 in the afc nad 16 in the nfc"
7088,yes exactly . in the us bowlers apparently made more than football players .
7089,"i think television has changed the popularity of professional sports . i mean , espn came up with the superimposed first down line , and that invention won an emmy"
7090,yeah that i pretty cool for them . i you know the highest score in college football ?
7091,was it when georgia tech played cumberland back in 1916 ?
7092,"yeah that was it , and the score was crazy , 2220"
7093,"not scoring any points is bad enough , but when the other team scores 222 , it would be hard to forget abut losing that game"
7094,yeah exactly . do you know wo benjarvus greenellis is ?
7095,was n't he a running back for the ne patriots ?
7096,yeah he ws and he never fumbled the ball in his career
7097,that 's impressive . i wonder how many years he played for the patriots to have that kind of stat
7098,yeah i do not know that but pretty impressive . apparently there is no written rule agains women playing in the nfl
7099,"it ? ll be interesting to see if a woman really does join the nfl . it 's possible that there 's never been a rule against it , which would be really cool considering the other thing women have hadnt o fight for"
7100,"yeah i wold live to see them play someday . a another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
7101,"i do , and so do students who went through elementary school before 1963 since it was commonly required reading"
7102,i am not sure ho such i agree with that but glad it is no longer . and jefferson created his own version of the bible .
7103,do you enjoy sports ?
7104,i enjoy the getting together with friends part of it but i would take or leave tha actual sports events . . . . except when i am watching my children play . how about you . . . that 's your favorite sport ?
7105,i souls say football
7106,"that is the favorite sport in my household as well ! tom brady is quite the dedicated payer both on and off the field , do n't you think ?"
7107,"yes , he is arguably the greatest steal in nfl history"
7108,i think a lot of people would agree with you . i am i name of his dedication to living his best life ! !
7109,"i mean he did n't even get to play at all in highschool , but wow he is amazing now"
7110,right ! and to think that h nwas a sixth round draft pick ! ! do you think if he had n't been drafted he would 've done a career involving nutrition or religion ?
7111,then we would n't have the famous brady of today . good thing he got picked
7112,someone with commitment like that though perhaps se told 've been famous in another career area . have you read his book ?
7113,do you mean his athlete 's bible ?
7114,"yes , that 's what i am referring to . i 've read some mixed reviews and wonder i fit 's worth the read . . ."
7115,"i mean all cheese self help book i thin karen a decent read of the time , but what hamsters is you"
7116,"i guess if you ar going to take self help advice from anyone , tom brady could be the guy . he is definitely leading by example"
7117,that is true . but the question is will you act on this advice ?
7118,that is a good question . would someone read the book looking for self help advice or just merely to get to know tom a little better ?
7119,i guess it would depend on the individual
7120,"i agree . me personally i think it would be a bit of both . . . . you know , take what you can use and disregard the rest !"
7121,i mean that is how i look at religion . there is no reasons to be stuck following only one religion such as following the bible . i think people should learn a abbi understanding of all religions first
7122,"good point . te same could also be said for his diet and life choices . i think it would be hard or the average person to be a strict as him with those things , but one would definitely benefit from a few of the tips !"
7123,"indeed . in any case , thanks for chatting ."
7124,"hi there , do you watch then fl ?"
7125,"hello , yes i do . do yo have a favorite team and or or played r ?"
7126,"i do actually , i love the patriots and my favorite player is brady . and you ?"
7127,nice same here . they did a great job this season . did you now brady has written a book ?
7128,"is that the athlete 's bible ? and i hear there is a documentary in production , tom vs . time"
7129,yes i am looking forward top hat one for sure . did you know women can play in the nfl ?
7130,"yeah that is pretty cool , i guess they have to meet the requirements but still pretty awesome"
7131,"yes it is . and engineers seem to ma , e more than football players in the long run"
7132,i guess that makes sense because football players have shorter careers
7133,yes exactly . do you know what the highest score in college football is ;
7134,yes i think it was back in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220
7135,"yes that lone , what a game that must have been . espn once won an emmy , do you know what for ?"
7136,oh was that for the superimposed yellow line ? '
7137,"yes that one , i thas certainly made our lives easier watching teh game from home ."
7138,"oh fo resume , no question there . did you hear about he nfl using racking chips on the players in the old ?"
7139,yeah they are tracking velocity and rotation and speed and all that fun stuff .
7140,"ye s , and i have they can use those stats somehow to make the game safer for the players"
7141,me too . did you hear about that weird cheerleader rule they have in new orleans ?
7142,about not being able to eat in the same restaurant as the players ? so sexist and wrong
7143,"agreed , i hope they get rid of it very soo ? do you know who benajrvus greenellis is ?"
7144,i hope so too . yeah he is hte rb who never fumbled a ball in his career .
7145,"hi , do you like to watch the nfl ?"
7146,"yea , i 'm a huge fan of the nfl although i do n't take it to the level of religion like tom brady does"
7147,he actually fulfill the whole purpose of his life with football
7148,"yea , i guess sports has a lot of similarities to things in religion such as saints , rituals , and community gatherings"
7149,"and commitment too . but i do like to follow the 17 week season , i had not realized each team only rests 1 week during the season ."
7150,"i never knew that engineers o average make more than nfl p ; layers in a lifetime , k guess nfl careers are pretty short"
7151,"exactly , t hat is why . an engineer as to work amy more years . did you know abou ta football match ever the highest score was achieved ?"
7152,"yea georgia tech scared 222 points on cumberland in 1916 , that 's pretty bad"
7153,"yeah , more than 100 years ago ! ! nothing like that has happened since then !"
7154,"yea so much has changed since then , now football is on tv and espn even created a superimposed yellow line to represent the first down line"
7155,correct and tey even won an emmy for that . did you know about a pink locker room ?
7156,"yea the university of iowa painted there visiting locker room pink , i guess they are trying to play min games with their opponents"
7157,"trying to intimidate the , but i think us a pretty funny joke . do you like any other types of football ?"
7158,i 've watched australian rules football and rugby before although they are n't on tv much
7159,the call it football codes . there is also a gaelic football
7160,interesting . i mainly hatch age nfl even though the game only have a average of 11 minutes of gameplay for each game
7161,"that is crazy , but i am sure you joy the whole thing . the game stops all the time . but personally , i like it like that"
7162,year nd the nfl collects a log of stats for the game by embedding tracking hips to shoulder pads and the football
7163,that makes it more interesting . you get to know details as ball seed rotation and more
7164,yea and maybe one day the nfl will have female players for some positions since there is no rule forbidding them
7165,"it would be cool to see . if they meet the requirements , the could play !"
7166,hi ! to you like tom brady ?
7167,"well enough , considering they 've been in the super bowl so many times . what o you ask ?"
7168,he has a book out called the tbs method . was n't sur if you wee familiar with it or what it was about .
7169,i had n't heard that . what 's in it ?
7170,it 's a book about creating a healthy lifestyle and he credits it with hm staying at the top of his game . are you familiar with his documentary called tom vs . time ?
7171,"oh , the one that gotham chopin is working on ! yeah , i 've heard of that ."
7172,"it 's pretty goo da after watching it , it changes my view od him . i believe it 's on facebook watch . are you a fan of the nfl ?"
7173,"i bought it was weird that deepfake 's son was working on a sports documentary , but if you say it 's good i 'll have to check it out . i follow the cowboys more than anything ."
7174,i liken he cowboys . did you know the highest scoring game ever was when georgia tech beat cumberland 222 0 ?
7175,i id not ! i do n't follow college ball too closely .
7176,i watch it but mainly the small region schools if i can get them in . in the 1960 's the top bowlers made twice as much as heat op football stars of the era . i 'm sur that 's not like that anymore .
7177,"with so many people watching and so much tech invested in the nfl , i do , d n't doubt it . the playoffs have to be with the money put in . they even put tracking chips in the balls to analyze e ."
7178,that 's crazy that they are going that high tec into a sport . although like you said with all the people watching there is in money involved .
7179,maybe tom brady 's onto something with his whole ' treat orbital alike a religion ' ? idea . seems like a not of fans already do .
7180,yes ! s speaking of religion did you know that the bible is the biggest selling book of all timer with over 5 billion copies sold ?
7181,i wonder how that compares to the number of nfl game tickets sold .
7182,probably crushes hte ticket slaves i would guess .
7183,"here are other patriots that area very religious , like at slated . i 'm sure the overlap between fans and church goers is not insignificant ."
7184,i id n't know that . former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball once during his career !
7185,it just seems like the team dominates regardless of time or subject !
7186,yes ! it was a pleasure chatting with you ! have a good day !
7187,good morning . do you like nfl football ?
7188,yes . i just learned tom brady has a book entitled ' the athlete 's bible ' .
7189,are you a tom brady fan ?
7190,not really . . . i do respect his ability . he does have an intereting philosophy .
7191,i agree with that . i do not care of him as a player or so bu tryout a n't donkey is greatness .
7192,"yes . there is a sort of spiritual video to the beat 's . one of their st players , matthews later actually in an evangelist ."
7193,that is interesting . what about the tbs method ?
7194,i think it 's brady 's personal philosophy include diet and health . a columnist named bob ryan described it as ' salt like ' but i have zero faith in news people including hose ins sports .
7195,"i a aware of bob ryan , i at a lot of sports shows he is repitzbl.e ."
7196,"do n't know him but that 's quite an accusation . when i thik of football , i do n't think of pink locker rooms like those for the visiting team at u or iowa ."
7197,i have heard of that pink locker room as well . seems like it would msn you down a bit
7198,lol yeah . . . did you know that pro bowlers made more money that pro football players in the 1960 's . art o imagine . . .
7199,"that is crazy , boy how the times have changed ."
7200,"yeah , one new development i like is the new ; low line introduced by espn for the 1st down line . they won a welldeserved emmy for that ."
7201,"i do n't think anyone can watch football without hte yellow line anymore , what an innovation"
7202,"yes , it makes me even lazier for the postthanksgiving dinner football . speaking of lazy , it is said that there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay in an nfl game ."
7203,"that is crazy , then why does it take 3 hours ? some like it should move along faster ."
7204,they must be going from snap to whistle but that still seems way low .
7205,"i agree with that , it must be all the commercials"
7206,"i played in a nd there is a lot of standing around waiting be people t do stuffy ike move the markers . oh well , did you hear that the tower of babe ; may be real and located i iraq ?"
7207,i agree with that . in was based on a real building there .
7208,cool . i would love to see that . thanks for th chat !
7209,do you watch much football ?
7210,"no , not much , but i do find the sport fascinating . it is such an american classic pastime e , at least for spectators ."
7211,"it really is . there are so many things to learn about the game . i have watch on and off for years but still learn new stuff ,"
7212,did you know that technically women could play on a teams ? nothing forbids it ?
7213,really ? i wonder what keeps them from playing the n .
7214,"me too ! it seem like someone woul have jumped in by now ! maybe women are just too smart . football seems dangerous , and i heard that the average engineer actually makes more money over their ifetiem thant he average nfl player ."
7215,i would imagine unless the players are getting lots of endorsements or have a super long career they are n't bringing in the amount of money that people think they are .
7216,"yeah , there are an awful lot of players one and team , and some do n't last long . what do you think about tom brady of the patriots . 8 heard he is trying to promote football as a whole lifestyle , maybe even religion , sort of thing ."
7217,i think he is just trying to scam people .
7218,"yeah , hat is about my opinion too . ia m guessing it i ships plan for making money when he has to leave the sport ."
7219,probably setting himself up for some work of supplement company or books or something . he ca n't really believe all the stuff he is saying . it is just ridiculous .
7220,i agree . it surprises me that so many people fall for tha stuff . and gotham chopin being involved ? it is all so weird !
7221,i 'm glad to see there are people that are skeptical of it . i think so many will fall for this drivel just because eh is famous .
7222,"yes , but you have to admit , the patriots have a good record , at least . recent years . ad they seem to thrive under pressure ."
7223,they do . i wonder how much money the owner is spending on them yo get those results . i wonder if they are making the profits to make that worthwhile .
7224,"i 'd be curious to know too . they doh ave quite the history . did you know their former player , benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball during his whole career with the nfl ."
7225,wow . that is quite the feat ! i wonder why we dont hear more about him ?
7226,"me the ! and i 'm not a huge football follower , but i ca n't help wondering at how it really seems to be an america passion only for th most part . i wonder if the u . s . would be different if its ' football ' was soccer or rugby or another sport that was a little less violent ."
7227,i do n't know if i would classify rugby as less violent . it is like football without padding only everyone is wearing soccer cleats .
7228,"yeah , probably not , but at least the players do n't seem to be hiding behind gigantic uniforms . regardless , i certainly hope more americans do n't start considering tom brady 's lifestyle suggestions their bible !"
7229,i really hope so too ! he is not the right kind od guy to follow .
7230,"hi , how are you ; ? safe you ready for a fin what today ?"
7231,for sure . do you watch the nfl at all ?
7232,"the nfl ? the national football league ? ye s , i 've heard of it . ks it any oops ?"
7233,well it is good and a very big deal n the us now . even women can play if they qualify
7234,women ? wow . do do the women do against the men ?
7235,"i am not sure bu ti would like to see them play together . i mean there are only 11 , minutes of active game play"
7236,11 minutes seems like a short game . do n't they have to play longer usually ? w hat about the commercials and stuff ?
7237,yeah that is what keeps us red to the tv for that long . in the 60s bowlers made more money than football players
7238,the 60s bowlers were the epitome of cool . everyone waned to be great like them .
7239,"yeah i guess , things have really changed now though . but still engineers make more than football players now"
7240,engineers are the ones that make everything in life possible . they should be paid more . they should have competitions every sunday .
7241,"ohh that would b pretty cool , what tides they come up with . and they are the one that likely made those tracking chips they put in the players now"
7242,hey sure are ! the game is safe because of engineers . the players shoudl be grateful . the nation should beg grateful . have you read the bible recently ?
7243,i have not but i know some facts about it . how about you ?
7244,i have read the bible and hav knot found the answers o the questions that i had abou football .
7245,yeah i do not think they are there . they might be in the version that jefferson created
7246,jefferson created a bible ? how much money id he make on did ? i know he was rich .
7247,yeah he created a version of it and took out all the supernatural stuff because he did n't believe un it
7248,there must not have been much left ! i guess it 's short book . he did jefferson do this ? was he any at god or something ?
7249,no he just did not believe in resurrection and the miracles that are in the bible
7250,"that is astounding ! he helped create america , and hat is a miracle that deserves to be in the bible !"
7251,"that is a god point , h his one of the main guys at that time ."
7252,hi ! do you follow football ?
7253,"yes i do , do you follow tom brady ?"
7254,i do n't follow him every closely . i know he is a dominant force in footbal .
7255,eh 's a very dominant force . he 's also in tune with his spiritual is . he 's a really deep individual .
7256,"that ' really cool . i heard there is a documentary or something comin out about him , tom vs time ?"
7257,"thats ha ti heard as well . it 's supposed to document how came from a 6th round draft pick , to one of the best there 's ever been . i 'm excited to see it ."
7258,"he didnt even get a chance to play when he was on jv in high school , t grey refused to start him a their backup . how got where he is , 6 ring s ."
7259,coach belichick helped brady adn company a lot . he really knows how to bring people together for a common goal .
7260,that is why there is that ? in bill we trust ' otto
7261,"they mesh really well together for being so different . brady is larger than life to was , but you hardly hear about belichick ."
7262,i heard that the fans describe his fashion sense as raggamuffin
7263,i heard . 's hard to view him as being charismatic .
7264,i can se ethan . brady on hte other hand has those qualities . that is why they are shih a god pair .
7265,it takes a special bond for someone to comeback after being down 83 .
7266,that biz partly 3g there is the tbs method . and so many buy into it
7267,bob ryan does n't believe in it . he said crazy is n't a spiritual figure and he thinks his new book is creepy ?
7268,"i havent read his book , but i personally dont see him as a spiritual figure , just a good football player ."
7269,"i think his spiritual side tallow hi into be more in tune with what is doin o around him . if it works for him , it works for him ."
7270,"very true . everyone ahs their own path , just because of might differ from mine doesnt askew it wrong ."
7271,he is a great example of what ca happen to someone that is truly committed in what they believe in .
7272,"very true . its been great chatting , but i must get going ."
7273,hey ! do watch football ?
7274,"hi ! i do ! i fact , i ' v been wanting to follow the tbs method aka the athlete 's bible that he was helps him stay at the top of his game a 140 ! hat abou thou ?"
7275,i watch football . they me little bit more about this method . do you practice navy sport ? i guess 212 method focus in physical activities .
7276,i'ts tom brady 's best seller and it appears to really work considering he 's appeared in six super bowl in eight tries !
7277,ok . good luck then ! are you fan of any football teams ?
7278,"i honestly love the nfl in general . even though the regular season is only 16 weeks long from september to dede , uber , whuch is way too short . ah ! w hat about you ?"
7279,i do n't gave any team i really like and support . but i also was wondering why this is just 17 weeks long . any idea ?
7280,i honestly do n't know ! even though it is hollow dump with six teams from both conferences moving o te playoffs leading to the super bowl . starting with found division winners and two wild card team from each conference .
7281,o ? do you know that fl has no written rules against female players ? but it looks like they have sort of eligibility requirements .
7282,"you would think we 'd at class have a female kicker by now , right ? especially when you consider there are only 11 minutes of live nfl gameplay on average per game ."
7283,"exactly . but why no ? with all movements in the society , i 'm wondering way there is n't fight for fe , male players . . ."
7284,"to be honest , if they want to do it for the only , they 'd be better off entering the engineering field since engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players ! that would seem like a wiser dinanc9ila choice !"
7285,absolutely ! are you surprised about comparison or engineers nd layers ? i was sure players make a lot of money .
7286,"same here ! that was surprising . in the 1960s , hte top bowlers eve made more than the top football players , which i could n't believe and also found to be very sad , honestly ."
7287,true . do you know that the highest score ever in a football game was 2220 ?
7288,really ? that is insane ? do you think they were angry because their lockerroom was painted pink alike hte visiting football team 's locker room at the university pf iowa ? ha !
7289,"good joke ! honestly , i 'm not sure this is respectful strategy to hve painted pink room . i honestly do n't think this smart ."
7290,"it sounds like a bad idea . ha ! but not as bad as forbidding cheerleaders from dining in the same restaurant as the football players like the saints o . that is ; plain wrong na misogynistic , in my opinion !"
7291,"i allso surprised why this rule is still here , because it would be not legal from a lot of points of view . but i 'm sure nobody follows it . t 's like tradition ."
7292,"hopefully taht 's all it is , otherwise ther would be some lawsuits i 'm sure . i mentioned the athletes bible earlier , b ut are yiu familiar wit 'the regular bible as well ? it has sadly over 50m illion copies , surprisingly , which i guess that ' way it 's the most influential and bestselling book ."
7293,i used to dead bible when iowa as a child . i honestly did n't know that until 1936 it was quite common for students to read bible as a part of elementary education .
7294,"i did n't either , honestly ! just a si found out recently jefferson created his own version of the bible by cutting out the supernatural parts . that was interesting ! well it was great chatting with you today ! take care !"
7295,"good morning ,"
7296,good morning . how are you ?
7297,"doing well , i was just reading news about tom brady 's new athlete bible , have you heard of it ?"
7298,yes i believe i have heard about it . have you read it '
7299,"no , but they say many is like a ' messier ' to patriot fans , i think some people spend too much time with football , how about you ?"
7300,absolutely . football takes over thursday night saturdays and all day sundays ughhh
7301,"some people take i too seriously , did you know the university of iowas ' locker room for th opposing team is painted pink ?"
7302,ol yes and wht gets me is that no fema has ever tried to be i the nfl . the no rule against them being on a team .
7303,"most women have better things to do with their time han play a game , it is lucrative though , amazin glow times change , in the 1960 's so bowlers made more than football players ."
7304,yes that is amazing . as well as the average nfl game only has 11 minutes worth of gameplay .
7305,"seems like much longer than 11 minute use do you know an engineer makes more in a lifetime than a football payer , and does n't have to worry about getting a concussion ."
7306,lol thats mind boggling lol
7307,"i know i would be unhappy to be a saints cheerleader , they have crazy rules ."
7308,yes they do . like the restaurant rule . oi mean seriously thats crazy
7309,"that would be annoying , b ut i guess that trade everything , the even use chips to shoulder pad to track he players moment ."
7310,yes i agree . do you know how many supposed shows of the bible there hav been ? its over 5 billion copies i hear
7311,"wow , i live it has been published in many languages , speaking of language , do you know the tower of babel was based on a real building in iraq ?"
7312,no i did not . what and every president has been sworn in on the bible except 2 of them .
7313,"kids used to have to read the bible in school , after 1963 , that only happens in private school , i wonder if our societal slide woul be as great if we still exposed kids to the ideas bout treating others with respect that are in the bible ?"
7314,thats a goo question . its been good talking to you .
7315,you as well
7316,thanks goods ye
7317,hi these ! wondering if you like football ? tom brady says football has become his religion !
7318,i do like it ! yes . . . he even wrote a boo about how he maintains balance in bits life cdaleld the tbs method . have you heard about it ?
7319,yes ! i love that he wants to know why we 're here and what our purpose is !
7320,yes ! he credits it with hopping his to stay at he top of his game .
7321,he does ! i like that he recognizes sports in a polarized nation can actually bring us together .
7322,i agree . the do tend to ring people together . have you seen his tom vs . time documentary ?
7323,"no . interesting footbal fact , d id yum now the nba has no rules against women playing if they can meet th requirements ?"
7324,i find i did hear about that . i wouldnt be surprised if w set a woman make it here within the next few years . that 's quote a ve playing at the high school levee now .
7325,i agree . the nfl as 32 teams .
7326,yes ! did you watch the super bowl this year ? it 's usually held on he first sunday in february .
7327,i did ! it was great . crazy that an engineer 's average lifetime earnings are higher than an nfl'er .
7328,yes . ike guessing probably because they have a longer order . in the 1960 's top bowlers made more than the top football stars from that era .
7329,i did not know that ! did you know tha 'the saints cheerleaders ca no eat at the same place at the same tiem as an nfl player and even have to leave is a player comes in while they 're eating ?
7330,id id n't know that in hat 's a weird rule is n't it ?
7331,it is ! the nfl also uses track chips to track players and footballs . tech sure way changed the game !
7332,yes it is . that seems to be getting a little too technical if you ask me . lol
7333,"so , back to brady 's interest in the bible , did you know prior to 1963 shcoolchildren often read from the bible as part of their education ?"
7334,"i did n't know that . i do know the bible is the highest selling boo , of all time with over 5 billion copies sold ."
7335,"i am not surprised at all . i know there were only two presidents , roosevelt and adams that did not use a bible it swearing in ."
7336,i did n't know tat either ! it was nice chatting with you q
7337,bye
7338,have a good day !
7339,"are you interested in tomb brady 's book , the btw method ?"
7340,"i did n't know eh published a book , i thought ' the tbs method ' was a diet book of some sort , have you read it ?"
7341,"i have not . i guess it is some kind of diet book , just mr brady 's that on it . what helps hi , m stay mouthful into his fortress ."
7342,"perhaps it has something to do with his love for avocado icecream , ish had that it 's a big part of the 1912 method , have you had avocado icecream before ?"
7343,"i just ca n't picture avocado ice cream . i guess that 's the thing with most healthy food , they 're not appetizing . maybe tomb would have his own ice cream brand ."
7344,"oh my i hear you , if i wanted icecream , i 'd just go for the good stuff , the rich and cream stuff not the frozen avocado ! do you think diamond for avocado increased as a result of his cook ? my that 's why they 're so expensive ?"
7345,"why stop t avocado , how about broccoli ice cream . if you put an nfl logo on it it will sell , or a picture of tom brady with his thumbs up ."
7346,"i think that 's what tom brady will do once he 's too old to play football , he 'll launch his own food brand company but he should probably wing it since there 's only eleven minutes of live gameplay per a multimillion dollar salary"
7347,that stat about minutes is amazing . the game seem to go on for hours and yet it is only eleven minutes . i wonder how much time is taken up in tv adverts .
7348,"considering that it takes me teh entire sunday to watch those games , i imagine they make lots of money in advertisements adn yet in teh 1960s , bowlers made much ore than football players !"
7349,i bet the owners are wondering what happened dos till i heard a life time as an engineer get her more than the average football player .
7350,"yeah ! is bowling even broadcasted on sports channels anymore ? do you think that 's true , that engineers make that much more than football players ?"
7351,"i think it he average player , not the mega stars . i think the average length of career is only tyreek or four years . still , when they retire they are pretty well set ."
7352,"ou , i see . yeah , but i often hear about how football stars or athletes mismanage their money . you think if the females were to play they 'd make comparable salaries ?"
7353,i doubt if . i understand there is np rule they ca n't play . i suppose they could be a kicker . j 've never really been into fooball so i ca n't really comment .
7354,trey rule be a kicker but i 'd imagine they need to meet some sort of physical requirement in order to survive a tackle by the 300 pound linebacker !
7355,"i 'm a pretty big guy , i ca n't imagine myself spanning up well to that . i might need a bible afterwards , last rights and ll that ."
7356,"haha , speaking of bible , prior to 1963 , students were required to read the bible as part of their curriculum , do you think that should still be in effect today ?"
7357,i 'm actually from england and went to school there before coming here . we did religious studies and i think there is no arm in being educated on religion .
7358,"ha me too , there is los of good things to be learned from the bible , but i would imagine teachers may find it difficult to teach if htey were of a different faith or something"
7359,"there does not have to bed preaching , just what education abou what it is . we were taugh about all religions and th facts of them . we were never told to believe in one or the other ."
7360,that 's great ! i imagine it would also lend to students likd jefferson who created his own version of the bible by using a razor to cut the supernatural parts to snake a science fiction book !
7361,"they , how are you ? have you heard about to brady ' th etb12 method ; ' ?"
7362,hi ! i have as am latter of fact . it 's the athlete 's bible . ha ! i heard brady credits it for being in such great physical ape at the age of 40 !
7363,have you practiced any of tht ?
7364,"i would love to . honestly , i 'd like to follow it during the offseason just to get me by considering 'the nfl ' s regular season schedule is only 17 weeks long from september to december . it lives nyt !"
7365,"are you nfl fan ? i honestly watch so , time , but do n't consider myself as a"
7366,"i am a dig fan honestly . i love the saints although i do n't love that ridiculous misogynistic rule they still have in place that forbids cheerleaders from dining in the same restaurant as the football p ; layers . it ' a like , how has no lawsuits been filed over that one yet ?"
7367,"it looks like old tradition and i 'm not sure anyone follows int . alot huge is a question about penalty . o k , a lady decided to stay in a restaurant . what will be penalty for her ? its interesting question ."
7368,"agreed . i a n't believe in this day and age no one has complained about it yet . just as i ca n't believe no women have been higher by any teams yet considering here are no rules preventing them from playing as long as they meet the eligibility requirements , y kno w ?"
7369,"it could be next stage for metoo . i am lady try to be nfl paper , but will be rejected . i 'm sure it will be huge canal ."
7370,"so true . you 'd think witht herd being only 11 minutes of live gameplay , they could at least sign one to be a kicker , right ?"
7371,i 'm not surprised . a lot of commercial . just a lot . it 's really annoying ?
7372,you are right about that . bt i supposed women wood be better off financially by entering theyd engineering field since engineers make more than teh average lifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl player . which is surprising to me !
7373,"i 'm sure a lo of money go to tv , owners of streams , etc . just not fair for players ! did you know that the highest score in a football game as 2220 . can you believe ? ;"
7374,that is insane and humiliating . do you think georgia tech was mad because their lockerroom was pink like the visiting football team 's locker room at the university of iowa ' w are ? ha !
7375,i do n't think this is only reason hahahaaa . poor players ! i would stay at home for year if i lost game like this . because everyone will makes jokes about me and this event . just want to change topic . do you read bible ?
7376,tell me about it . i do n't now what 's worse : that it knowing the top bowlers made more than the top football players back i nthe 1960s . i read it sometimes . what about you ?
7377,i usd to read a lot when i as child . i did n't know that apple and evil was the same word in latin ' malus ' and just in 4th century apple become apple .
7378,wow ! i did n't either ! i also did n't know that adams and roosevelt were the only two presidents who did n't use a bible or their swearing in ceremonies s mj figured there would have been more !
7379,do you know any reasons why it was n't used for ceremonies ?
7380,"i honestly do n't know ! but speaking of bibles adn presidents , jefferson actually created its own version by cutting out . supernatural parts . wonder if that version is called the ' king jefferson ' version ? ha !"
7381,that 's good one ! it was nice to chat with you . have a good day !
7382,great chattin with you as well ! i 'm off to research the etemenanki . they say the biblical tower of babel was based off it . have a great day !
7383,"hi , are you a football fan ?"
7384,i used to be
7385,i watch here and there but not too much .
7386,"ever since the kneeling , i quit watching"
7387,ahh . i totally disagree with the kneeling thing too . i just dont have cable so i dont tend to follow too much .
7388,patriots in again . . . . ho w
7389,i know . it i like a given at this point . im beginning to wonde if brady i seven human
7390,that 's great that you cut the cable . i did also . no regrets .
7391,"just some internet and netflix here . if i care enough ti wathc a game , i have friends to go see t with ; and if it is total blow out , like that one 2220 game , we an just play games and chat instead ."
7392,"yeah , not sure how the cable companies are going o stay in business many of us cutting he cord or dish"
7393,"i thnk they are going to star offering streaming packages , or lowering prices . id be cool with picking af ew channels that i like end paying 20 . i do get into some ncaa football . i do like it better when y team does well though ."
7394,"yes , i think tou are right about that . that makes sense to offer a package of channels that are actually watched . i would do that too f the price were right . who 's your team ?"
7395,florida state . they have struggled he last few years . sent some strong people to the nfl who didnt workout too well recently .
7396,"yeah , good players usually from the sec"
7397,even college sports is starting to get a bit political with the playoff system mandm all of that . why cant we just play and be proud ? why do we have to ana ; lyme everything ?
7398,"yeah , it 's tough to watch espn anymore . seems very political . matching sports to get away from that mess"
7399,"very true . athletics is like my break from all of that . espn won an emmy once for the yellow line . i dont know what category that fits in to for san my , but its pretty neat ."
7400,i do n't think i 've seen the ' yellow line ' will have to check that out .
7401,it is digitally added where the first down marker is so home viewers can see it a little better .
7402,"ahh ok , yes i have seen that ' yellow line ' . i thought you meant they created a form or documentary called the ' yellow line ' ."
7403,ahh . that would likely be more worthy of an emmy tha a cgi line on a field .
7404,i think we can go now after 10 turns . that 's 2 towards you next cable bill . ha !
7405,lol ! have a goo dday !
7406,"well there , do you watch the nfl games ?"
7407,"i watch sometimes , but it 's hard to keep up with it all . do you know much about tom brady ?"
7408,i know he is a great player and like him a lof as one . apparently his favorite ice cream is avocado one
7409,"ot only that , bu football has literally become his religion"
7410,yeah it seems som such so has he now has even wrote a book on the sport
7411,there 's even documentary about his rituals in preparing to the season
7412,yeah eh i shall over now . did you know women can also play in the nfl
7413,"i wonder what the eligibility requirements are though , since none ahve played so far"
7414,yeah i wonder about that too but would be nice if they played too . do you know that the digest score in a game has been so far r ?
7415,was n't it a college game between cumberland and georgia tech ? 2200
7416,"yeah it was , what a game that must have been . i bet georgia tech still brags about it"
7417,"it 's likely in a hall of fame somewhere , though it would n't haven even on television"
7418,yeah i guess so . dod you know espn won an emmy once ?
7419,for the superimposed first down line ? i do n't know if i could be able to keep up with the game without it !
7420,exactly it i think it was a well deserved ward and kit made our game watching easier
7421,that and to chips used in the footballs and shoulder pads to track all the stats . i think those involve the viewers more
7422,yeah i really hope they can use the stats from those chips to mark 'the game safer too
7423,"maybe if the 1 minutes of live gameplay becomes safer , w omen will join the nfl"
7424,yes team is a good point really . technically they can play is they get teh requirements .
7425,"i think many of them are becoming engineers instead . he their lifetime , they 're likely to make more one than the average player without the is of injury"
7426,"yes that is a much better option . on another topic , do you know much about th edible ?"
7427,i actually do m and not eh version thomas jefferson created where h cut out the parts he did n't think were worth keeping
7428,yeah he must have really not believed about the miracles and the resurrection .
7429,i enjoy football o you ?
7430,i watch some on in a while . always try to catch the play offs
7431,did you know that in the 1960s that hop bowlers here better paid than top football players ? can you imagine that now ?
7432,i d work a bit harder on bowling . . lo that i crazy though .
7433,it is . i would have chose that route also . much less difficult on the they . do you know what the highest score ever in football was ?
7434,it was 2220 almost impossible to believe that even happened .
7435,it is so crazy ! how is it even possible to score that many points during one game ? !
7436,im guessing a combo of a reilly good team vs . a bunch of toddlers or a really bad team .
7437,i ca n't imagine . the must have been scoring the entire time . did you also know that espn won an emmy for th creation of the yellow line that wr see on tv that indicates the first down line ? i ca n't imagine rewatching football without that .
7438,"me neither , i mom was surprised when the went to one of my brother 's live games in hs nad it was n't there ."
7439,"ha ha , that 's hilarious . it definitely helps you to know what 's going on . were you also aware that there is a rb that never fumbled the ball in his career ?"
7440,"yeah , he plays for the patriots too . probably contributes to their on goin succes ."
7441,i 'm sure it helped . i 've also earth that the nfl on average has only 11 minutes of live gameplay pe blame . i knew there were a lot of commercials but that 's surprising g .
7442,well the clock runs sometimes when they are walking to the next play . plus all the celebrating makes the game a lot longer too .
7443,i agree . did you know that the nfl has no written rules against female players ?
7444,i heard that . if there was a female player i hope theyd treat them better than th cheerleaders .
7445,are you referring to te way the saints treat their cheerleader s ?
7446,yeah . its crazy that the have to leave eve is a player walks in while they are eating .
7447,i had heard that . it 's pretty disgusting . it 's one thing to say they ca n't be in the restaurant together but whether to say that if the cheerleader was ther first and eating she has to et up and leave if a player enters .
7448,i wonder why people have n't fought that ? it just seems so wrongs .
7449,good question . i di hear that a cheerleader for another team tried to unionize because she was only making minimum wage and she was fired so that may be earth of the reason . they do not seem to treat the cheerleaders well .
7450,maybe one day that will change . i must get going . its been great chatting !
7451,"hi , how are you ? do you know much about the bible ?"
7452,i 'm good ! i know that it is the biggest selling book of all tim ? do you know how many copies it has sold ?
7453,it 's got to be more than a billion . i figured almost every person on the planet would ave one .
7454,yes i agree ! it 's sold over 5 billion copies !
7455,"that 's tremendous ! did you know that before 1963 , it was not uncommon for american students to read from the bible as part of their elementary education ?"
7456,i did n't know that . thomas jefferson related his own version of the bible . wonder why he did that ?
7457,"hew wanted to out the 'supernatural ' parts , such s the miracle andc he resurrection wh e wanted to see religion in humanity terms ."
7458,interesting ! s ; leaking of president and the bible . . . teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams were the only 2 u . s . presidents who did n't use the bible when they were sworn in .
7459,i think they swore on the constitution . they felt that they owed allegiance to the people and the government first .
7460,that 's interesting ! i did n't know that . are you a fan of any of the 32 tempest hat are in the nfl ?
7461,i do n't follow the nfl much . do you have a favorite team ?
7462,"i , ike the steelers . lol i 'm more of a baseball fan . an engineer will make more in heart lifetime than the average careers or an average nfl and mlb player ."
7463,that 's one good reason to become an engineer . we need more engineers anyway .
7464,yes i agree . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . seems short for what 's supposed to be 60 minutes of game time .
7465,so much waiting around . i guess it creates anticipation . the tracking chips in players shoulder pads to record a players ' moves must shoe wthe standing still most of the time .
7466,yes lol those tracking chips seems like they are going a little too far just for a lame .
7467,"i guess it helps understand the game for strategy , maybe injury prevention ."
7468,that could be . that did n't cross my mind .
7469,i 'm bothered that new orleans saints cheerleaders ca n't eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player .
7470,i agree . that seems like an odd rule they have . it does ? 'it make any sense . did you know that there 's np written rule against a female playing in the nfl l ?
7471,"do you think the female player build have to leave the restaurants as well ? anyway , it 's been fun chatting !"
7472,lol yes it 's been a pleasure !
7473,have a good day !
7474,you too !
7475,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
7476,"i do , im not a big fan but i do follow the league , do you ?"
7477,nice . do you know how many teams are there ?
7478,"yeah 32 teams i total , 16 in each division afc and nfc ,"
7479,"yeah . and the game season is 17 makes , that seem suite a lot to me"
7480,"yesh seems like a really long time , 17 weeks , do you have a favorite team ? mine is in the afc division or american football conference"
7481,nice i do not have af favorite team i us watch the games . do you now who benjarvus greenellis is ?
7482,"he queen to play for the patriots right ? yeah i know who he is , why do you ask ?"
7483,yeah that guy . he is the only guy in the nfl to have never fumbled the bell
7484,"he was really talented , i never got to see him but y dad was a total fan"
7485,n't . did you hear about that rule fo the new orleans cheerleaders ?
7486,"no , i didnt hear about that rule , what about it ?"
7487,well it is pretty strange where they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players
7488,"that sounds like epa terrible nad sexist rule , well the team must have their reasons , i wouldnt put up with it though but ten again i guess cheerleaders at that level more a lot of moeny"
7489,yeah i guess but it is so wrong . did you hear they are using chips now to track the players in the field ?
7490,"i didnt know that , i wonder if players are ok with that , c hips can gather all kinds of info and it can be a bit invasive"
7491,well i think it is only during games s they can get velocity and rotation nad suck . they must be okay with it since they rare keeping them in their pads
7492,"oh i see , so is only applies to games , a thing i dont like about the game is that a lot of the times is wasted on ads , theres only a total of 11 minutes of live play"
7493,"yeah that is true , so much downtime there . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
7494,what about the bible ? hte collection of sacred text s !
7495,yeah there seem to be some interesting facts tied to i .
7496,"hi , how are you ? do you know much about the bible ?"
7497,hi there ! i know a little about the bible nd recently found sun that the top roof babel was based on a real building in iraq !
7498,"the bible is full of interesting discoveries ! for example , did you know that an apple only became known as an ' apple ' when the bible was translated into latin in he 4th century ?"
7499,i did n't ! did you know that thomas jefferson created his own bible version because he did n't like the supernatural parts !
7500,he wasted t zee religion in humanity terms . he wanted to understand the morality of christianity without the miracles .
7501,that 's z god explanation ! did you know that roosevelt and adams are th only ones whoo didnt ' use a bible at their swearing in ceremonies ?
7502,i think they were sworn in on the constitution . they felt that they owed allegiance to the people and the government first .
7503,that 's good . i thought maybe they did n't believe in the bible . many football players knee after games to pray . do you like football ?
7504,i sometimes watch football . it 's interesting that the nfl uae no rule against female players .
7505,"it 's very interesting , just li iowa 's pink visiting tea locker room ."
7506,"the pink probably is many to have a psychological effect . i ca n't imagine it matters such , or everyone would do it ."
7507,do you think there as much psychological effect gwen cumberland was defeated 2220 by georgia tech in 1916 ?
7508,i think probably the cumberland guys wondered why tht game was scheduled in the first place . pointless really .
7509,i 'm surprised george tech kept actively scoring point if i wonder how many points benjarvus greenellis has scored since he never fumbled in his career .
7510,the fun is a legend . he should golf a special bonus for that feat .
7511,definitely ! i wonder how much he really played though because the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay !
7512,"true , t he action is sparse , but pretty violent . i guess fans love hat aspect of the game ."
7513,yes we do ! i also love the yellow line o tv . . . did you kno espn on an emmy for thaat ?
7514,"i did not know that . i guess it must have been a nice line . anyway , t hanks for the chat ! ahve a good day !"
7515,you too !
7516,bye !
7517,bye !
7518,"do you watch a , elicia fooball ?"
7519,"yes , i do ! do yu ?"
7520,not so muh but i hear come brady has one teh super bowl and written a book .
7521,"yes , tom brady has one it several times . of is thought to be one of the best ever and he 's still going strong at 40 years old ."
7522,yeah your right . have you seem to s . time ?
7523,"i have n't . i 'm not a tom brady fan , but it sounds pretty interesting , e specially how he 's trying to figure out the ' whys ' in life ."
7524,yeah hes ' got a good read on hi shoulders . he was that in one of his spiritual episodes .
7525,i also thin i 's interesting that he feels the football no sports are considered a type of religion to so people . i 've never thought of it that way .
7526,me neither . like i said there fans are devoted in both him and bill belichick .
7527,"i 've never heard of the author , chopin , have you ?"
7528,"we i think that 's deep chord 's 5wla6ive , ."
7529,"you 're right . . . i do remember reading that now that you mention it . changing the subject a little . ? . i was reading an article of some little know football facts . for example , university of iowa has a pink locker room for visiting team . . . do you know any ?"
7530,sure the patriots had a former running back who never fumbled the ball in his career . do you know who that was ?
7531,"yes , that was benjarvus greenellis ! ! thats pretty awesome ! can you believe espn won an award for the creation of the superimposed yellow line ? lol"
7532,"hey do n't knock the line than it change 3 way we view the game and made life easier , lo l !"
7533,good point ! ! lol i had no idea the nfl uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads . how crazy is that ! ?
7534,"do all they will be is computer chips , just like that movie . advanced men playing sports , lol ."
7535,you 're probably right . . . well maybe gems will be cheaper to attend then . . . they wo n't have those high salaries to pay the players !
7536,yeah right you know the 'll find a way to stick to us . did you know that if a player comes into a restaurant to eat and a cheerleader id there the cheerleader has to lave .
7537,no ! that seems ridiculous in this day and age !
7538,right kind of sexist . i understand bout fraternization but come on .
7539,"right ! ! ! ! nut , yet , women can play football . the nfl does n't have a rules against female players ."
7540,well they should form a wnfl . have a good night nice chatting .
7541,"hello , do you like the nfl ?"
7542,"yes , the only is great and it 's awsome that there is not written yule against female players ."
7543,yeah i like that fact and hope they play at some point . on the other and they should get rid of that rule for cheerleaders in new orleans
7544,"yea , i agree it is ridiculous that cheerleader shave to leave a restaurant i players show up ."
7545,yeah that is too sexist . did you know there are only 11 minutes of game time
7546,that is crazy an di did n't know that . did yo know that engineers lifetime earnings are higher than the average lifetime earnings of n nfl player .
7547,i guess it makes sense because their careers are also longer
7548,"that is a very true point , i did n't think about that . did you know that there are tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record players movements ."
7549,"yeah seems like they re collecting lots of stats such as velocity , rotation and such . hope they cba use those to make the game safer"
7550,that would be nice . i think it also helps that the nfl is taking concussions are seriously .
7551,"yes exactly . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
7552,"i do not know has much ads i ; probably should for how much i use to ahve t go to catch , i do know that prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in hte u . s . to be required to read from the bible as part of their grade school education ."
7553,"yea hi am kind of glad that is gone as i believe re , region should be a choice and not imposed on anyone"
7554,"i agree with that . did you know that teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams are the only two u . s . presidents that did not use a bible at their swearingin ceremonies ,"
7555,did not kno that . i know taht jefferson cheated his own version of the bible
7556,jefferson sounds like a very interesting fellow who used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts in the bible .
7557,yeah he must have really not liked the miracles and teh resurrection pa tofu it
7558,i guess not . i do ind it interesting that malus in latin means both apple and evil . taht would makes things a little confusing in the bible .
7559,yeah i think so too . did you know that people think that the tower of babel mighty actually stiller exist ?
7560,"yea , i guess it is the etemenanki in modern day iraq ."
7561,"yeah , if that is the case i would like t visit such s historic place ."
7562,"hello , how are you ?"
7563,i 'm good thanks . are you a football fan ?
7564,not a diehard dan but i keep up with it . hat about you ? i have som trivia about football if you 're interested .
7565,"i 'm about the same . sure , i 'd like to hear it ."
7566,do you know about the tracking hips the nfl uses during the game ?
7567,"i have heard a little , i 'm surprised they are able to use it during the game and not just practice ."
7568,"no , they use them on every player to track kite very movement and also in th all . in the players , they put the chips inch their shoulder pads . the chips inside the football measure location , speed of the ball in rotation soft he ball ."
7569,technology is amazing . i can understand why they would be useful . if a player is getting tired they could tell right away .
7570,"i bet they can really compare performances between players pretty good with them , too . did you know tom brady has a bestseller ?"
7571,i have heard something about i be i might get a copy . i think it 's something about he keeps healthy at 40 .
7572,"yes , it 's called the btw method and it 's also called the ' athlete 's bible ' . he eats avocado ice cream , i dd n't even know there was such a thing ."
7573,i did't know about avocado ice cream either . i wonder if he uses a spook nor scopops it with doritos .
7574,"lol . , speaking of bibles , did you know there were 2 us presidents thatd i n't use a bible when they were sworn into offic e ?"
7575,know i did n't know that . which ones were hey ?
7576,"teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams . i 'm not sure why . i do know that thomas jefferson made his own version of the bible , h cut out all the verses on the resurrection of christ and on the miracles of jesus . he used a razor to cut the out and wasted them into his own minibible . he was a believer ."
7577,that 's interesting . i wonder if roosevelt and adams were atheists . i 'm going to have to look that up .
7578,"i know , i 'm wondering the some thing . well , you know hte bible has sold a ew more copies than tom brady 's book , actually . over 5 billion copies . i do n't think he 's going to catch up ever ."
7579,"i do n't either . it 's been nice talking to you . have a nice evening ,"
7580,same to you !
7581,thanks .
7582,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
7583,then fl ? you mean the national football league ?
7584,ye use do you have a favorite team or player ?
7585,"um , no , i do n't . i do n't know much about football . here are may team sin many places and many players with many faces ."
7586,yeah that is true . do you know how many teams are there ?
7587,there are probably 2 or 3 dozen that are good at football . good enough to be professional .
7588,yeah there are about 32 teams right now
7589,32 . that makes sense . tht 's lane oven number k so it can be divided y two . are there two leagues or divisions or something ?
7590,i am not sure about that . do you know what the highest score in z game has been ?
7591,the highest score in a game ? probalby over a hundred points . i do n't know . is that a tom brady game ?
7592,it was actually 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland day what a name
7593,that 's bogus ! why would they do that ? that seems cruel to humiliate that school . i think the other team should have forested .
7594,well they stuck to it it seems . did you know u of iowa painted 'the visitor locker room pink ?
7595,i thinkk hat hoss somethng to down with the breast cancer awareness movement or something .
7596,i am not sure actually . i hope that is the reason . did you know bowlers made more money than football players in the 60s ?
7597,bowling is a sport of kings . bowlers deserve more money from their elegant and charm .
7598,i guess so . gut had has certainly changed now . still engineers make more over their lifetime than football player .
7599,"i think that it would better to be a bowler . , but then again i ai n't so good with math . i guess engineers have a great future ."
7600,"yes it seems . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
7601,i 've read a bt at the beginning and the end . not much of a plot . kinda confusing .
7602,yeah i have not read it either but it seems to be packed with history .
7603,it 's hard to believe that tom brady was only a sixthround draft pick and now he 's won like 6 super bowls .
7604,yes . he knows how to win taht 's for sure . have you seen his tom vs . time documentary ?
7605,"i hae n't , but it sounds interesting . he takes pride in his craft , no doubt . his offseason preparation plays push a big role in his success ."
7606,yes . you cna wathc it o facebook watch . have you red hid book ; the tbs method ' ?
7607,"i haven ' tread that either , but if it provides an hips for how to stay fit add successful over 40 , i 'm very interested ."
7608,yes ! that 's what it 's about ! did you know that the highest scoring football game ever was when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 ? crazy .
7609,"i feel bad for cumberland . that would have been hard to play through . q score liken ha would set social media on fire today , but hack in 1916 , it probably didnt pause room man of a stir ."
7610,no . probably not . in the 1960 ' stop bowlers made 2 times as much as the top football stars . i 'm sure that 's way different now .
7611,"indeed , bowlers do n't get as much publicity or respect today . it 's all about them are sports . but for career lifetime earning , engineers have pro football an dbasbeall players beat ."
7612,yes . probably because of their longer careers i 'm guessing . former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled one time during his career . amazing !
7613,he that have had really good and . that is an amazing statistic . it 's also amazing that there is only about 11 minutes of live game play during an nfl game . that 's a lo of downtime .
7614,so it is . imagine w much more fun it would be to watch if they played more . i hate how they feel at the end of quarters and run safe plays to burn time off the clock .
7615,agreed . those tracking chips the nfl puts in players ' shoulder pads really do n't have all that many movements to recorded when you think about it .
7616,no . same with the tracking chips open the footballs . seems like they are getting too analytical about it .
7617,"dig less they are trying to study injuries more , but maybe they should focus on public relations a bit more . a woman in the league or less friction between players and cheerleaders might create a better public impressions or the sport ."
7618,yes . i think we 'll see a woman get in there at some point seem . there 's no written rule against having female player sin the nfl .
7619,"i agree . it was probably be a kicker , ad that would give them a chance to really contribute to a team 's ability to score . that would be cool ."
7620,yes it would ! did you know that the bible is the highest selling book of all time ? it has sold more than 3 billion copies ! t hat 's a lot of books !
7621,"yes , that is a lot of books ! and so many different authors have contributed to it . thomas jefferson even created his own version ."
7622,i did n't know that . teddy roosevelt adn john quincy adams are the only 2 u . s . president who did not use a bible when they were sworn into office .
7623,i wonder why that was . and i wonder waht they were worn in n l
7624,i 'm not sure . it was nice chatting with you ! have a good day !
7625,do you know had ? he is a great of a hall of famer
7626,"no , i dont follow football closely . i know th eu of ia 's visiting locker room is pink . u guess there are worse ways to intimidate a team ."
7627,"i agree but it us an intersting tactic , intimidate a team by ink , that might slow them down ."
7628,maybe when they first painted it . not today . i can believe that espn won an emmy for that superimposed yellow line . must have been a bad year for entertainment .
7629,"i agree e , doesnt seem to bone worth an emmy ,"
7630,i find it hilarious that bowlers in the 60 's made more than football players .
7631,"i fin that hilarious a swell l , pro players make so much money not that seems irrational"
7632,"well , how else is brady going to pay for his avocado ice cream ?"
7633,"i hear he cats lots of them , part of his success i wondered a its actually good for his performance"
7634,"i do n't know . it sounds disgusting to me . it 's interesting that eh is on a spiritual quest , yet looks at football as a religion ."
7635,"i guess for many it is a kind o religion , that would make brady one of the saints or angels of the nfl religion ?"
7636,"who knows . maybe he will be like jefferson , and treated his own version of the bible ."
7637,"maybe he will be might read that , sounds like an interestin ibook , did you hear about that humiliating defeat cumberland suffered"
7638,"i do n't keep up with football , sorry . i am unsure how i feel about the tracking chips in the footballs and shoulder pads o ; layers . sounds very invasive e ."
7639,"it does seem invasive , i agree with the chip in teh football we can learn about the game by placing the chip in th ball"
7640,"interestingly enough , teddy roosevelt and john q adams did n't use a bible at thier swearing in ceremonies ."
7641,"i gurls they arent religious , they sure lost a lot of its because of that ,"
7642,"i would n't think so , as people back then new ow to separate country and religion . unlike today . weird though , they did include passages for the bible in schools ."
7643,"i think religion shouldnt be mandatory we all have differnt views , cultures and they should be respected ,"
7644,i do n't think so either . i do find i intresting that appeal mens both fruit and palace .
7645,"the name has an interesting origin i agree ,"
7646,"hello there , do you watch hte nfl ?"
7647,"i do , love the nfl you ?"
7648,same here . i like tom brady teh most probably . do you have a favorite player ?
7649,"i do , my favorite player is brady as well , he is so talented , he was won everything and still has the determination to win more"
7650,ye not sure and now he is eve na book author . did you hear about that ?
7651,"yeah two books actually , the 12m method phd athletes bible , so he not only makes money from endorcements but also from oops"
7652,yeah tale about talent all around . and he stays healthy by eating avocado ice cream its seems
7653,they were the favorites to win the last superbowl and its seems brady ha enough avocado icecream do to the trick
7654,there you go . did you know when can technically play in the nfl ?
7655,"i didnt know that although its ot a suprise thet dont play i nthe nfl , can you imagine that ?"
7656,"i am curious what they woul look like . it is to they have the option . not like new orleans cheerleaders , did yu hear about their rule ?"
7657,"no , what rule do they hav concerning cheerleader ?"
7658,well they are not allowed to eat in th sesame restaurant as the players
7659,there not ? tat is s really bad rule did you know that espn won na emmy because of the yellow first down creation ?
7660,that is pretty cool to win an award for it . but i guess it does help a lot if you are watching the game from home especially
7661,"it does , i think its one of the greatest inventions in the same , oi keeps the game more organized qanda also easy to follow"
7662,yes agreed . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
7663,"no not really , who is benjarvus greenellis ?"
7664,he is a former qb who played for hte patriots a never fumbled the ball in his career
7665,"oh i see , he must hav been a great qb then , no fumbling , that sounds like a hard thing to do"
7666,yeah he was for sure . i as nice chatting with you .
7667,"hi , are you a football fan ?"
7668,"yes , i like soccer . it 's very popular a ; l over tuned oled ."
7669,are you talking about soccer or americans football as in nfl ?
7670,soccer is called soccer in the us adn footbal everywhere else .
7671,"i see , well i do n't know much about soccer but i am interested in odd facts about sports . did you know the is a college football that that has painted tshirt visiting teams locker pink ?"
7672,i would guess that has something to do with breast cancer awareness . i know that many football players suffer fro breast cancer in thur later years .
7673,"i never though of it that way , that 's . interesting perspective . tell me why hyou like soccer ."
7674,it is aw good game for women . i think women fight harder o nthe pitch than men do .
7675,i have the feeling you are a woman . so you like soccer beacuse they fight ?
7676,"i think it is a good way to get even on the green . to set things alright . american football would be a better way , but we karen ot allowed to play ."
7677,younger tight there is no need to find tin american football because he whole game is one big fight .
7678,true . men hae it easy . they ca find reasons to fight and people accept them .
7679,do you like to fought or do you use alike to blow off steam ?
7680,i like to blow off stream by fighting through playing a sport . do you read the bible ?
7681,"i page read the bible , but lately have developed a whole different concept of what god is . how about you ?"
7682,the bible tells us to seek righteous vengeance upon our enemies on teh field of battle . there is a field of battle for women . we must invent one .
7683,amaze you should join the mma . are you familiar 8th hot ?
7684,"yeah , it 's good , but i 'd like to see more examples of it . ,"

7692,i have not read it yet and i ma also looking forward to the series tom vs . time
7693,i think tha tit will be good . he 's done so well staying healthy all cheese years .
7694,"yes he sure has . i wonder if that is the reason he sticks to healthy ice crimea too , avocado"
7695,"probably , and he 's had a good supporting cast on his team . rom his linemen and the staple of good running backs . he has benjarvus greenellis , he was a steal back . he never fumbled in his career ."
7696,that is so impressive that be managed to do that in his career . did you know women can play too in the nfl ?
7697,i did not know that . there 's no written rules against it ?
7698,yes there is not but i do not know of any women who hav tried for it
7699,i wonder why none has tried .
7700,yeah me too . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
7701,was it 2220 ? i know georgia tech beat cumberland diy tha touch in the early 1900s .
7702,yes it is still that weird . what a win . on another topic do you know much about thee bible ?
7703,i know a little bit . when i went to school it was n't uncommon for us to be required to read from the bible . although i went to scool way after 1963 .
7704,yesh that seems strange . it as already sold more than 5 million copies
7705,did you know that apple only became known as an apple when the bible was translated into latin in the 4th century ?
7706,"yes because it just ge same meaning as evil too , from the word malus"
7707,that 's pretty interesting . since heard that teddy roosevelt did n't use a bible at his swearingin ceremony . i wonder if there was an outrage back then ?
7708,i wonder about that too . quincy did the same thing as well .
7709,"hi , how are you ? how much do you know abou 'the bible ?"
7710,yes i do . . the best selling book of al time
7711,"did you know that before 1963 , it was o uncommon for american students to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education ? time certainly have changed !"
7712,my mom told me that . thomas jefferson did not believe it miracles and the resurrection .
7713,"true . he created his own version of the bible , he wanted to see religion in humanity terms ."
7714,teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams must no shave believed as well
7715,they did not use a bible at their swearingin ceremonies . i think the swore on the constitution .
7716,it interesting how the work apple came about
7717,that is an interesting coincidence . the word ' malus ' means both apple and evil . so eve actually ate levi ; .
7718,good point . tom brady is a true believe rand a very spiritual person
7719,i guess he could e sworn link on a bible . maybe his on . lol .
7720,"hhaa , he did write his ow bible like book called ' athlete 's bible '"
7721,i guess that must be a best seller since he 's a champion and all . ahve you read it ?
7722,i will one day . i would like to see his facebook videos called ' tom vs . time
7723,"that woul , d be interesting . the nfl has a lot of interesting personalities . did ou knw that the nfl has no rule against female players ? women would be allowed if they met the league 's eligibility requirements ."
7724,i never knew that . i do not like the fact that cheerleaders ant eat with the playes
7725,"yeah , the cheerleaders are required to leave . thats seems sexist . the nfl uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads to record a player 's moves on the field . maybe they could record theirs movement off the field and avoid these situations ."
7726,it cool to know that espn created the superimposed yellow line representing the first down
7727,"i guess it was innovative for its time . now it just seems to normal and obvious . well , i enjoyed chatting !"
7728,me too . i am about to go reads to brady 's book
7729,enjoy ! use it for your swearing in ceremony !
7730,lo li will
7731,hav you read tom bradys book tbs method ?

7734,"no i am not sure that sounds so good , although i do enjoy avocado . the book is bradys est selling athlete 's binge and lifgesty , e brand ."
7735,yeah how he still manages to do that even at two . the fans have a greed for the patriots . ' in bill we trust ' .
7736,they say that football is tom brady 's religion of sorts . he has a emotional love for the game
7737,yeah i heard that as well as the book having a curtis undertones .
7738,it is said that football is his vocationit 's what gives his life demeaning and purpose
7739,"yeah he says hes ' after something bigger the football , bigger than wins and losses ."
7740,he has series on facebook watch that looks at his physical and mental preparation and the other episodes will focus on his spiritual like as well .
7741,yeah is it called tom vs . time ?
7742,"yes , h e says to live bliss spiritual life through sports is a very authentic way to learn"
7743,yeah thatd poes sound zen . iowa universities visiting locker room is painted pink .
7744,that is so funny . i was that espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line
7745,"i love that line , it represents the first down ! ! lol . do you kno that there was q retired patriot that in his career as a rb never fumbled te ball ?"
7746,yes was n't taht benjarvis greenellis ?
7747,yes what an amazing accomplishment . do you know how long a regular season is ?
7748,i believe it 's 16 games . is that correct ?
7749,it is because of the biwerek it makes it 17 weeks but 16 game i correct . 3 teams split into 2 divisions .
7750,i saw that the nfl uses tracking hips embedded i nthe shoulder pads to record their moves .
7751,"yes and in the all to record speed and velocity . i tell you the way tech is in , who knows hat the game sill look like in 101 years ."
7752,"yes , that should be interesting . i was that the nfl has no written rule against female players"
7753,"i heard that too , i wonder why none have tried out , that i 'm aware of . have you heard of any ?"
7754,no i haven ? t . it says that they woul be allowed to if they met the eligibility requirements .
7755,i think they should create a league lke the wnba .
7756,yeah that would be good . did you know that an average nfl game only ha 11 minutes of live gameplay
7757,well we must be watching a lot of commercials then ! nice talking with you .
7758,"morning ! not sure about you but i really like tom brady , health enthusiasts n football player . did you know bout his spirituality ?"
7759,"i dont really like the patriots but brady is hte best i hav lever seen , and no , what about his spirituality ?"
7760,he take a spiritual approach to life and the game . he says he want it know why we ' e her e and our purpose . then he tries to unite people too .
7761,"i think thats great , he published two books the tbs method and the athletes bible ."
7762,"yes , that 's right ! so moving on to football , did you know the highest score ever was georgia tech vs cumberland 2220 ?"

7764,"haha know ! i did not know that the term football covers any sport that involves kicking a ball with the foot , did you ?"
7765,"yeah thats soccer , its actually my favorite sport"
7766,"oh , nice . i also had no idea that the nfl has no rule against female players so long as the can meet eligibility requirements ."
7767,"i had no idea either , just are your thoughts on this matter ? seems like woman re at a disadvantage because of the strength the gmail needs"
7768,i say play if you can ! did you know that new orleans saints cheerleaders ca n't eat at the same restaurant as a player and have to leave if a player it here ?
7769,"that is a really unfair rule , did you ever watch the football player benjarvus green ellis spray ?"
7770,"no , i do n't think so ."
7771,"ok so he wa a running back for the patriots , he used to be great , never fumbled a ball , is retired now"
7772,"wow ! that 's impressive . did you know the nfl uses chips in shoulder pads and balls to track velocity ball speed , rotation and location ?"
7773,"i i not , its crazy how tech is taking over the world , over spooks , it has made the same better though , just like the creation of the firs down line knw football"
7774,"yes , agreed . so back to tom 's mention of th biber . did you know that thomas jefferson treated his own version for the bible ?"
7775,"he dd , i wonder how it different from the original version , jefferson was a really smart iman"
7776,"yes , very smart . it differs in the fact that he took a razor and removed all of the supernatural references . good talking today !"
7777,thats odd l why take the miracles and supernatural parts out of it i guess hen ad his reasons .
7778,i guess . have a great day ! goodbye now .
7779,"hello , my great friend ? how are you ? have you thought about football recently ?"
7780,hello im good and no not since 'the superbowl im into basketball are you ?
7781,basketball ? is that even a sport ? i thought there had to be blood for a sport to be recognized in the bible .
7782,ha ! i guess there would obey be footbal and hockey if taht was the case .
7783,"true . also drakes a s ; for a sport . women 's soccer is a sport , meh 's soccer is not a sport . i figure ethan basketball should add helmets , pads and tackling to make it real ."
7784,hmm to each his own i guess bible ties and modern times differ a lot who knows maybe it would be acceptable now .
7785,in the 60s bowlers made twice as much as top football stars . bowling is n't technically a sport according to the blood criteria .
7786,you have a wide range of sports knowledge i see how 'd you come to learns o much '
7787,"i have to set that it was my strict religious upbringing . the athletic catechims that i received gave my holy insight into sports . football is the oldest , of course ."
7788,may i add what religion ?
7789,i do n't reckon that my foreheads game it a proper name . they called it teh faith . we keep the faith . football nad sports were part of the faith .
7790,very interesting may i ask what football team your a fan of ?
7791,"favorite one particular real is a transgression in teh faith , for all strive to be recognized in the eyes of the creator . there is no hierarchy among the saved ."
7792,"i see , i here a form of church of this religion you speak of ?"
7793,not a formal church . the church is wherever members of the faith gather in congregation to east in the name of the creator .
7794,how would one go about attending one of the services ?
7795,"we are not a proselytizing religion . the bible has hints and signs of how to join , but only the pure can enter the faith and cousin with the creator ?"
7796,i see i liver in a big city i have a feeling it woudl be hard to get into it .
7797,do not despair . other have watched football andc find way to the faith .
7798,"i wo n't , i guess i 'll just watch more football ."
7799,peace . prosperit7y . faith . football . have a blessed day .
7800,you too !
7801,"hello , are you by any chance a fan of the new england patriots footbal team ?"
7802,i know some about them . mostly stuff about tom brady
7803,great . what do you think of hs record as a qb ?
7804,h eis obviously one of the bet . i heard he is having a documentary made about im called ' tom vs . time '
7805,"yes . 1st episode aired on facebook in january . more to come , i understand . behindthesvenes stuff ."
7806,they say what is really th important part f it is in emotional love for the game . it is what gives his life purpose apparently
7807,agreed . his bestselling book has been dubbed an ' athlete 's bible ' . not so sure i 'm comfortable with that term . . .
7808,yeah that is different . he credits a method called ' th tbs method ' with keeping him at the top of his game data ge 40
7809,"do n't know much about it , nut i can say tha 'the recent term , ' lifestyle brand ' , which applies to brady , . disturb me . there are commercial ' brands ' , sure , but lifestyle band ? what do you think '"
7810,it sounds a bit like ac cult following to me . it says that football is his religion . strange to me i guess .
7811,"agreed . butt hen i guess i 'm not a superfans . i love sports , but in 's entertainment to me , not religion . what 's your take ?"
7812,definitely ; y just entertainment . it some to be his main goal in life though . sad . he says to live his spiritual life through sports is a very authentic way to go
7813,"mmm . i 'm no expert , but i wonder if brady 's just really trying to say , ' do , i 'm more than just a jock . ' which a lot of peopel already know . . ."
7814,"maybe so . a psychology professor , daniel jann , says that sport string people together more thin religion . i agree unfortunately that that is probably true"
7815,"glad point . but i 've been at soccer , football , matches where nasty fights broke out . sports divides too , does n't it ?"
7816,you cary rights actual ; y . i saw that the patriots have the own saying ' in ill we trust ' i am not sure i like that motto .
7817,"right . belichick 's no god . he us a great coach , whe balls are properly inflated , , and brady navy e the greatest qb of all time . did you see the patriots ' super bowl game against the atlanta falcons ?"
7818,it is very true but still they are only human right ? they say that the fans have a near religious devotion .
7819,"heard that . when you have a team that can co , e back from a 28 to 3 deficit and win a super bowl in overtime , that ability to rebound from beings own tragically energized people , d n't you think ?"
7820,it can for sure but for hte fans todo describe him as a kid of messi do i just think that i going a bit far .
7821,"i agree . that 's way off never , and must eb offensive o some devoid faithful of many religious . do n't think brady has divine inspiration , just great human inspiration and athletic skills ."
7822,they say they ' r some players who try to keep the focus on their faith in god rather than the team
7823,"glad to hear it . hoped they ; re not mocked too much . some folks , like pro bowler matthew slated , have been downright tefangslical of the field , but done it quietly , not ' fort he money ' , as it were ."
7824,"yes , i 've seen that . i read that slated and outer patriots were featured on football sunday , a national burch based outreach event on super bowl sunday ."
7825,"good that they got a point bite . although lots of us will never really buy brady 's messianic hype , we can always appreciate his football accomplishments , and wonder how many tens of millions of he 's getting in sponsorships . for life !"
7826,yes he started his career was a 6 round draft pick and now he is arguably the best ever at his craft
7827,absolutely . his name is already carved into millions p memories . great to talk football with you .
7828,"yes , i have earned alot !"
7829,"me , too . thanks ."
7830,"hi there , do you watch the nfl ?"
7831,"hi ! i love watching football ! i enjoy watching on tv and appreciate the yellow line , but do n't think it as emmy worthy for espn"
7832,yeah that is quite an award . o you hae a favorite player or tea m ?
7833,i love the green bay packers ! what do you think about tracking clips in the players ' shoulder pads ?
7834,"i likd did because they seems to track velocity , rotation rand such which i hope and be used to make the game safer"
7835,that 's true the safety impact would be are ! they need to be a little more concerted about womens rights iman ew orleans with their cheerleaders !
7836,"i think so too , it is rude and sexist . why can ; t they b at they same place ."
7837,especially when they were ther first ! obviously football players are n't as gret as everyone thinks because an engineer makes life in their lifetime than our overpaid football players .
7838,yeah i guess their careers are shorter so they have less opportunity to make money
7839,"yes , just surprising with wat they make per year ! i wonder how much benjarvus greenellis made with never fumbling in his career ?"
7840,"yeah that is pretty amazing , what a talent . did you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?"
7841,i heard that ! i wonder if that tactic actually works . maybe georgia tech did too when htey defeated cumberland 2220 in 1916 . . .
7842,"tha big such a record , wow . maybe that is what it was . did you know there are only 11 minutes f active game play"
7843,thats insane it how long the entire game takes ! did you know that bowler suns so make more money than football players ?
7844,"i can not really wrap my mind around that . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
7845,"i know some , but did n't know roosevelt an adams did n't swear in on the bible . . . i thought presidents had to !"
7846,i guess it is optional . i wonder what kind of bible jefferson swore on .
7847,i wonder if it was his own with the supernatural parts cut out ?
7848,i a knots sure but he just did not believe erin the miracles and the resurrection part in the bible
7849,i wonder if e believed in babel because people think it 's based on a real building i iraq .
7850,yeah it seems to be the etemenanki i would more to see that .
7851,do you watch football ?
7852,"i do , i love football , tom brady is one of my favorite players ."
7853,apparently he has some exciting ideals about his success .
7854,"he is one of the most successful players , how and the superbowl wit his teammates this year"
7855,yeah i did n't see the game . i hear e owes his success to the avocado ice cream he eats .
7856,"relaly avocado ice cream ? that doesnt sound like a good food for a player r , but who knows maybe it has secret properties"
7857,yeah he says it all part of his tbs method .
7858,"dig suess its as good as method as any , brady must win a lot of money , bowlers used to make more money in the 60s"
7859,yeah i know twice as much ca you believe that ? the patriots are sighted to win th next superbowl as well .
7860,"yeah , the patriots are a team with a solid base so yeah , it would make sense to watch them win another superbowl but football is a game full with suprises , one never knows"
7861,that 's the i would honestly like tos ? another team raise to the occasion . cheerleader are not allowed to stay a ta eating place if a player comes in .
7862,"thats a really messed up rule , that is totally unfair , it should be the players the ones tha the to leave , that rule makes me so angry"
7863,yeah it does seem sexist . i do understand that there trying to avoid employee fraternization .
7864,"its really odd , do yo know about the tracking chips players have embedded in their shoulders ?"
7865,"i heard about that , soon we will be watching drones and ai players ."
7866,"i agree , tech i stacking over the world , many football players suffer brain damage towards the end of their careers so maybe they can make tech that keeps players protected"
7867,"they should set a limit ti how long a playes career is as well , . theres a movie about that brain damage you mentioned ."
7868,"really ? i havent see that one , what is it called ? i bet many people in the industry disliked the movie"
7869,"? was called concussion , will smith played the main character . th nfl went to great lengths to keep all this quite"
7870,"oh i think i watched that one or at least fragmehts of the movie , do you think that mcvie changed things ?"
7871,very little but regulation about helmet to helmet and the design of th helmets changed . nice chatting with you .
7872,"i hope things can change in the future , its been nice chatting with you as we , l ."
7873,i enjoy football do you ?
7874,"yes , both college and fl . waht do you think of tom brady and his book the athlete bible ?"
7875,i had no idea he wrote a book . i wonder if he really wrote it or it was a ghost writer ?
7876,"who knows . . . its ot really about religion , it 's more of a philosophy and taking care of oneself ."
7877,h would definitely be someone who knows about taking care of themselves physically . he seems to have a good family life as well .
7878,yeah . there are religious entities on the pat 's . matthew slated is an offthefield evangelist .
7879,"wow . i had no idea . speaking of football , did you know that in won an emmy for creating the yellow line that marks the first dogs ? can you imagine watching a we without that there ?"
7880,"hit was a nice addition . bob ryan , a columnist , disliked brady 's bell , it systems ."
7881,honestly i would have to was the book to make any judgement on it . i suppose it also depends on if reason for writing it .
7882,"well , he sure does n't need money . i heard his model wife makes more than im . wow ."
7883,i had also heard that . i suppose she was the most popular supermodel in the world at one time . were you aware that in the 196 's top bowlers made more thant op football players ?
7884,"yeah , that 's change tremendously . i ca n't believe that former pat ' benjarvus ellis never fumbled in hi nfl career . amazing ."
7885,i didn ot know tha tc that 's amazing ! i did not think that anyone ha accomplished that .
7886,die you know that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual gameplay . seems way lo . . .
7887,"thatd poes seem very low . i knew they spent on people lot of time on commercials , reviews , and setting up but i did n't think it was quite stat extreme ."
7888,i layed in hs and there is a ; ot of standing around even without the commercials . we did n't have tracking chips in out shoulder pads either . hee .
7889,i did hear there were tracking clips in the players and the football . my question is why ? they not use those at all to make calls ? why do they only play on reviews when they have that data ?
7890,i do n't know . the would have to instrument ta lo of stuff for that . it would remove human error though .
7891,oi agree . did you a know that in the 1960s op bowlers made more than the footbal players ?
7892,that sure has changed . did you know the tower of babel in the bible may be a real rich in iraq ?
7893,no i had no idea . i wonder how the came to that conclusion ?
7894,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
7895,"ho here , yes i do very much so . do you have a favorite player ?"
7896,"yes i sure do , i really like brady a lot as a player . and you ?"
7897,"nice me too , i love the guy a lot . do you know his favorite ice cream flavor ?"
7898,"it is what is super heath , avocado . he is very dedicated to a healthy diet for sure"
7899,sew he sure is . did you know he wrote a book also now ?
7900,"yes the t1b2methond , the athlete 's bieber wh ave you read it yet ?"
7901,i have not read it yet . and there is also a documentary series tom vs time tha i would like to eventually watch
7902,yes me too actually . di you know u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink ?
7903,i wonder why that is thouhg . do you know what the highest score in college goofball is ?
7904,it is 2220 and it dates back to 911 when georgia tech beat cumberland
7905,yeah was a game really . id you know espn won an emmy once ?
7906,yeah they won it for the superimposed yellow line and i am happy about that .
7907,yes it has made game watching at home but heavier for u for sure
7908,agreed on that . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
7909,"yeah eh is a legend , he only guy in nfl to have never fumbled the ball in his career"
7910,what z guy really . did you kno about that weird rule that new orleans cheerleader shave to abide to ?
7911,yah about not being able to eat in the same restaurant as the players so hat is up with that ?
7912,yeah an they naive to leave emit meal . that rule is sexist and has to go
7913,agreed on that . do you know much about the bible ?
7914,i know that is it one of the most influential books and has sold over 5 billion copies
7915,"yeah exactly and it was part of the education system until late , like 1963"
7916,"hello , do you watch football , as in the nfl l ?"
7917,"i ahve watched football . sometimes in between , i read ."
7918,nice . did you know women cna technically play there too ?
7919,"women can technically do many things , but should n't . i think taht men could technically become nfl cheerleaders . should they ? only the bible can say ."
7920,"i suess . speaking of the bible , did you know jefferson make his own version of it ?"
7921,"dig use it could be called a bible , but it lacks the essence , teh crew , the soul of the bible . who was jefferson anyhow ?"
7922,"he was one of the presidents of he us , the early ones . i guess he did not appreciate the supernatural within the bible that have to do with resurrection and miracles"
7923,"e failed to get the promise in those miracles . i guess they dried to sloth is own course , one not parallel with the bible . it bet jefferson would even watch football if he were alive today ."
7924,you never know i guess . i you know why an apple is called as such now ?
7925,"well , what else would we ca , l it ? we had to have a name for it , and i guess steve jobs came up with a good one ."
7926,well it originates from the late language malus which means bath apple an devil
7927,"i never thought the fruit was evil , but the company was literally so . apple . hm . never would have guessed there was bil lurking in its skin ."
7928,i guess sk . in the us up until 1963 thee able was a required read in elementary schools
7929,i figure that would let that jefferson one in the schools . too bad .
7930,yeah i guess not . the biblical tower of babel actually is believe to be a real building that exists today .
7931,a real tower ? does it say ' babel ' on it ? or trump ?
7932,"well , i am not sure what it says in it but it is the etemenanki in modern day iraq ."
7933,i 'm surprised a building of that size has lasted so long
7934,"i ahve no idea , but i am glad it survived . history should not be destroyed . going back to football , hte games apparently last only 11 minutes of active game"
7935,i guess the players have other things to attend to . they are pretty busy . sunday is a work day for them . i hope they re editing the bible like that jefferson fellow .
7936,yeah that is true . it was nice chatting with you .
7937,hey friend
7938,"hello hello there , dp you watch the nfl games at all ?"
7939,"i love watching the nfl games , it is y new sunday religion , ? about you ?"
7940,"nice , i only watch it sometimes . did you know women can play as well ?"
7941,i did not know what .
7942,oh ther eyou go . the game lasts only 11 minute really do anyone should be able to do it
7943,"my ex wife could be in the nfl , she iss o strong"
7944,fi dye know engineers make more money heir football players over their lifetime ?
7945,"i bet they do , you really only last a few years in the nfl defending on how good you are . did you know in 10 the top bowlers made more money than football players ?"
7946,yeah that is insane to me . but even now engineers make more than football players over their lifetime
7947,"that is so insane also , i want to be an engineer is otto make mork money l"
7948,yeah i guess it is a good profession for that . did you hear about nfl using tracking chips on the players ?
7949,"i did n't now that , are they in their shoulder pads ?"
7950,"yeah they are and they track velocity , rotation and a bunch of other stuff ."
7951,"wow , it must be made by those engineers who make a ot of money ."
7952,there is a good chance there . did you know the espn won an emmy ?
7953,"i did know that , it was fo that yellow line on tv right ? !"
7954,"yeah the superimposed like , i guess that deserves an award . even bowlers used to make more money than football players back in hte day . ?"
7955,i did not know that ! good chatting with you !
7956,"yeah , at least they were able to claim that . nice chatting with you too ."
7957,bye !
7958,goodbye .
7959,"hi there , do you watch the nfl games ?"
7960,i love the nfl ! i try to follow all 32 teams the best i can .
7961,nice . i did not know the game season is 17 weeks . that is a long time and lots of games
7962,yes . it seems to o fast . each team plays a 16 game schedule .
7963,yeah it does seem that for sure . interesting that bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s
7964,how much more did they make than the players ?
7965,"not sure but i think ut was because at thagt time football was not that popular . it even today , t he engineers still make more than the average football players"
7966,probably because in the long run they have longer career . did you know the highest scoring game ever was when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 ? crazy .
7967,that is insane . did you know espn got an emmy once ?
7968,i did n't know tht . hat did they win it for ?
7969,it was pretty strange but they got it for inventing the superimposed yellow line
7970,intereting ! rb former rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled during his nfl career . that 's pretty incredible .
7971,that sure is . what a talent . did you know women can play too ?
7972,i think i read that somewhere . i do n't think there 's an rule saying that they ca n't play as long as they meet the eligibility requirements .
7973,yeah that is is . i hope it happens soon . did you kno about that weird rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
7974,no . what is it ?
7975,they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the football players
7976,that 's an odd rule for sure . there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay in an average nfl game . seems like that should be a lot more than hat for hat they get paid .
7977,"yeah it is strange since we have to be glued to the tv for so long too . on another topic , do you know anything bout te bible ?"
7978,i know that it is the best selling book of all time with total sales of oliver 5 billion copies !
7979,yeah that seems a lot . jefferson apparently made his own version of the bible
7980,i did n't know that . teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams were the only 2 u . s l presidents who did n't use the bible hen they were sworn in .
7981,yeah they must to have liked that . jefferson took out the supernatural from the bible .
7982,good evening ! blizzard like conditions here has me thinking about breaking out the bible on a cold night inside !
7983,"i wont rub its if your face , g ut i live in florida so i have the ac running . it might do so as well ."
7984,"lol ! i wo n't be altering joy bible like president thomas jefferson did . i guess he was n't fond of things like miracles or resurrection , so he took them out of his version ."
7985,"i heard that , it a razor no less . nothing like picking and choosing what parts to follow . there are a few presidents who were sworn in on somethings else too ."
7986,"sow . i would have thought that was in the constitution or somethng . do you happen to , now which presidents were n't sworn in on a bible ?"
7987,"teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams . i am surprised jefferson isnt among them , or at east with hi special bible ."
7988,"i agree with you . i know that the bible has different interactions or legend does that one denomination considers canon and another apocryphal , but i doubt most of those made a decision quit eas arbitrarily as our former president !"
7989,"very true , there are several that catholic include ye t , protestants dont . i dont know ow those decisions came about , t remove parts , or even that is in those parts removed ."
7990,"a lot were based on church council . wht catholic use today , was mostly modified in the 100 . i think the new testament most christians agree on , but the old testament is a different story !"
7991,"that is interesting for sue . i think the translation of the word apple is interesting , have you heard about that one"
7992,"i do n't think i do , but i 'm interested in hearing more ."
7993,"when it was translated in to latin in the 4th c , the word malus , lean both apple and evil ."
7994,"interesting . you take it for grate that it was always apple . then again , you did other things might be true . for example , the tower of babel appears o be abused on a building in modern day iraq ."
7995,taht is really cool . i think biblical history is pretty cool
7996,"u agree . by the time i was in elementary school , the bible was ' beings turned , but i guess it was the norm for the generation before me ."
7997,it fan ever a part of my schooling either .
7998,i wonder if it was part of tom brady 's because he has his own personal belief system these days .
7999,i hearted it as called tbs
8000,"that 's right the i guess some consider it an ' athlete 's bible , ' but is more than just athletics , . i think there are some that have mentioned that it is almost curtis !"
8001,i can see that . patriots fans consider him the messier .
8002,"which id a litte unnerving . there is no counting his accomplishments dont he field , but not sure i am ready to follow his bleeds off the field ."
8003,i would agree with you there . ive got to get going . i chat !
8004,"hi , are you a football fan ?"
8005,"yes , i was a k chiefs season ticket holder for a decade and moved to the best area 4 years ago . so i watch a lot of football , college and pro ."
8006,good . did you know that a college team once defeated their opponent 2430 ?
8007,"no , i bet to school at illinois ans ahve set through a lot of losing football , but scoring 222 points of a game seems almost impossible to me . i wa surprised in the 60 's the top bowler made double the top football star . things have really changed since then ."
8008,yes they have . i am still as sports fan but k am somewhat outraged at thas salaries .
8009,"well , it was surprising that an average , and once again , average engineer 's life time earnings is higher than thee average nfl and m ; lb player . i can see that for football p , layer switch injuries and so career bringing down the ' average ' , but not baseball . they top stars though i handsome compensated that for sure ."
8010,"yeah nfl careers are shorter becaue of the injuries . but , what do you think about a mlb palmer getting 30 billionn a years for ten years ?"
8011,"i think our societies value 's are a little upside down , 30 million to plea a do game . i was a little surprised that there 's only 11 minutes of live gameplay in the average nfl game . i hope that brings the injuries levels downs a lot of old nfl 's are broke and suffering ."
8012,i was thinking abot that too . imagine how many hours of practice go into that 11 minutes .
8013,"yep , and of all the older players who they studied their brains for that drama syndrome , they almost all showed signs of it . sad and it seems a little barbaric for national tv revenue and our entertainment . yet i watch the sport ."
8014,i know right ? we all o . i wish they could figure out a way to make the short safer .
8015,"the paying lip service , what do you think of the gotham chopin assertion that many use nfl akin to a modern religion . i ive outside boston and thought that as a little overststment . i might say more akin to nationalism or mode secular they of things that bring people together or rival communities in competition ."
8016,i like your community competition nice better . some people get pretty radical defending their teams .
8017,"yes , i work with a couple of alabama prison tide alumni and they might get on the border line religion . that university of iowa , painting the visiting locker room pink is kind of funny . i guess he georges into psychology , irony and a bit o farce ."
8018,"of is kind og funny . but , do you ever wonder why we love watching violence . football , backing , mma and even the news fascinates people ."
8019,"well i do n't like boxing and mma , but they do have a lot of fans . as i examine football i wonder what draws me to it , must be something in my lizard brain . it drives commercial revenue and makes a lot of money so there 's something in society it caters too , we havent evolved game from the romans gladiators blood sports in the coliseum ."
8020,i think have nailed it with the roman gladiators . society really has n't changed much at all .
8021,"since there 's no explicit rule against women in the nfl , do you think they 'll ever eb a womb kicker ? i 've seen some women 's soccer am6ches that looks like they 're good enough !"
8022,i think there will be a woman president before there is a women kicker even though i think the can be good enough .
8023,"i think they could as place kicker , not any other positions . once again society hasnt evolved as far as we think ."
8024,"agreed . thanks for the good conversation . have a good one , ."
8025,hello do yoy like tom brady ?
8026,i love him and his inspiration . i would like to read his book ' athlete 's bible '
8027,me too . its a best seller just like the big e .
8028,the bible is the best selling books of all time .
8029,thomas jefferson did it believe in miracles and the resurrection . he made his own bible
8030,teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams musk tid not believe as wel .
8031,its intresting how the word malus ' means both apple and evil .
8032,ok . did you know that females could play in the nfl ?
8033,no but i dont like how cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player
8034,that is crazy that they would have to leave if a nfl ; layer come in .
8035,ta cool that espn made the yellow line
8036,that is cool . it is also cool it they put tracking chips embedded in player shoulder phds to record moves
8037,yes and they put team in the footbal stop recorded data
8038,own do i think that the nfl seems to have more than 3 texas ?
8039,it doe shave only 16 . each team playing 16 gems andc saving on bye week .
8040,"so if a team has only 11 minutes of live gameplay , the rest must be commercials lol ."
8041,good point . did you know that bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ?
8042,thats crazy . it like how engineers make more in a lifetime
8043,and what up with that crazy cumberland blame . i would have walked off the field
8044,i woul have walked of faster the first 100 points .
8045,tele enjoy tom brady and his video . good day !
8046,"hi , how are you doing today ? did you hear anything about tom brady and that football has become his religion ?"
8047,i have not . when did he start what religion ? its rounds intriguing .
8048,"well , tom brady has a peak for ou lives which includes joy , good health , and peak performance . and he throws in a little avocado ice cream to boot ."
8049,why would he ruin ice cream ? a godgiveh fruit ?
8050,"i know , right ? no really , he credits al , l of hoss success to something called the ' tbs method ' and it 's brady 's bestselling athlete 's bible ' and lifestyle that he credits with helping him stay on top of his game t age 40 . ?"
8051,i have not heard of this method . is it a special method for people like me ?
8052,i 'm no sure abou 'the answer rio tha but brady 's apparently on a spiritual quest and it appears to work . i would say tbs stands for tom brady his 12 points of devotion to winning the game . tom actually loves the game and its his vacation . its a gives tom his life meaning and purpose .
8053,i am glad for tom . e has found his calling . e can spread the collins .
8054,"well , it all about a series which started ons jan 25th on facebook watch and the first two episodes oped at ready 's rental and physical preparation ."
8055,"it sounds intriguing . i guess to , has it made . do you eve read the bible ?"
8056,"yes , i do . and , i believe that the bible is an intricate inspiration from go to us humans here on are . how about you , do you believe its really from ged ?"
8057,"i do not know . i have not read the bible . i now that the person that wrote it probably made , over on it ."
8058,i 'm not sure about that but everyone has the choice to believe whatever they want to believe . all i know is that it 's estimate that it has sold over 5 billion copies and is the bestselling book every written .
8059,"tthat is many copies . i hope that the person who wrote it got some money . often authors do not get paid well , ."
8060,"go figure , hey k it you know that the university of iowa 's football team locker room is completely painted pink ? now that is funny !"
8061,why must they paint it pink ? did they lose a bet ?
8062,i 'm not sure about that one but did you also kno hat in the 60 's top bowlers got paid twice as much as the top football stars ? is tha wild or what ?
8063,i guess bowling much mores challenging than i thought . now i respect bowlers much more .
8064,"funny . still , football is an exciting game , did you know that the highes escort fan a football game happened in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 to 0 ? that must ahve even some game to watch way back then . they might not have even worn good helmets that pong ago ."
8065,helmets are essential to game . that would e terrible if the victory was because one tea mid not have helmets .
8066,that would have been as home if thay is what happened . i found out the espn won an emmy for superimposing that yellow line representing first down for american football games . that 's cool .
8067,"its here , do you watch the nfl ?"
8068,i do . apparently tom brady has made football his religion .
8069,seems like a . he is great at it . i bet that avocado ace cream he likes helps with staying in hsapoe
8070,yeah i like avocado 's but i do n't think they belong in ice cream .
8071,did you know he is a book authors s well now ?
8072,"cha i heard that , the athletes bible right ? have you read any of it ?"
8073,i have not bu apparently it is that has helped whim he to where he is now
8074,i 'm sure being married to giselle des n't hurt . i hear she makes twice as much as he does .
8075,leah she is such a famous wlorslm one so no wonder there
8076,they say that he patriots even this early are still slated to win the next super bowl .
8077,they have bee thing pretty good there so i would not be surprised . did you know women fan day in the nfl ?
8078,i know i was surprised that no one has attempted to try out . personally o think theyd should just have their own league like te wnba
8079,"yes me too , i would watch that for sure . i you know espn on an emmy once ?"
8080,"yes and i approve that yellow line madam y life easiet , lol !"
8081,"true . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
8082,i know that thomas jefferson made his own bible by defining one .
8083,yeah he took out all the supernatural stuff with az razor
8084,he shoud have just went and got a nonfiction book . two us presidents were not even sworn in using the bible . do you know who they were ?
8085,was n't that roosevelt adn quincy ? hey must have really not believed .
8086,yeah i guess but what did they do pick swear them in .
8087,"haah good one , i wonder how that went . do you know how thye word apple came to be ?"
8088,as far as biblical they say tha 'the original word was translated ino latin and it meant the evil and apple . nice chatting with you .
8089,"yeah , some here . have a good one"
8090,did you know tom brady has a best selling book ' the athlete 's bible ' ?
8091,is that the top method everyone is talking about ?
8092,yep . it is somehow equate to spirituality although it is about staying on top a san athlete in that short brings peope together like a religion .
8093,"at 40 , l and still at the top of is game , i bet there is quite an audience for anything he has to say on staying healthy !"
8094,"yeah , pats fans see brady s a messier . some , reflecting on coach belichick say ' i ill we trust ' ."
8095,"tat 's quite a creed to recite . ? under bill an tom , the pats have won 6 superbowls , band in a game where winning just more superbowl is the goal of a lifetime , i can understand the reference afforded these guys ."
8096,"all the reference may be a little over the top . a columnist , bob ryan said i was ' cultlike e ' ."
8097,"sure . football fans often border on idol worship each sunday . and to many , football is the only religion they have . that makes the vulnerable to wanting to fill their hearts with something bigger thin themself ; aves ."
8098,yeah . football is me that to mind in the world that like the ' football ' that americans call soccer . i guess we have kicking the ball though some kind of goal in common .
8099,"we can find inspiration in athletic performance and success , and for some , that is the depth of their spirituality . i am reminded of the words of eric little , the olympic champion runner , who was that he felt the pleasure of god when he ran . there are faith lessons in brady ' example of dedication to his craft ."
8100,he is dedicated . i wonder if he would be in pro football players were paid less than top pro bowlers like th newer in the 60 ' .
8101,"good point . but i think brady is a true believer , whose dedication goes beyond money . . . bu money helps i ; m sue !"
8102,he gets really good pay considering the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual gameplay . it kind that 's low . . .
8103,"yeah , but brady i san anomaly . the average nfl player has a lower lifetime earning potential than the average engineer . but it is a game that is fun to watch !"
8104,i 'm an engineer rand i do n't see that . not for someone that 's a top qb like brady .
8105,"i would like to see brady 's wife , the field ! there is no rule against female players in the nfl , but they still must pass minimal eligibility requirements ."
8106,"she 's a supermodel that makes more than him wo , do n't hold your breath . my alma mater beat proper cumberland 2220 in 1916 . that 's really running it up . ind of shaemfil . . ."
8107,almost as shameful as having to return from a brutal game loss into a pink visitors locker room like in a . . .
8108,yeah . many think it 's shameful that kids bo longer read from the bible in elementary school like they did before 1963 .
8109,half the kids ca n't read the days anyway . . ; . even if it is from sacred texts .
8110,"sadly , that 's true . thank for the chat !"
8111,"hello , do you like football ?"
8112,i do liek goofball . it is a classic struggle to pu the ball in the goal .
8113,"do you like to brady ? i heard he take football really seriously ,"
8114,tom brady is a interesting personality . 6 super bowl wins in eight tries . 140 years old . na efficient quarterback .
8115,"he our is , i wonder ho much more time he has left in the same 40 years old is an old age for a player"
8116,it is a good question . perhaps the documentary series ' the vs time ' will shed some light on toms remaining time .
8117,"i havent , but i think its a documentary worth wathcign , many interesting facts about brady"
8118,"yes , many interesting things . do you think people come together and worship sports or are they simply fans . belichick cant really be a religion can he ?"
8119,"well i guess it makes sense , fans do worship sports and even deepfake chopin had a comment supporting this ."
8120,"interesting idea , sports as religion . the nfl and each team i see it to make money though . when running back benjarvus greenellis never tumbled a football in his career , i wonder if tat made him a saint ?"
8121,"that definitly sets him apart from other players , maybe a saint or something higher i loved to watch him play"
8122,"so when espn superimpose a yellow line on the field to show the first down line , is that worth an em , m or a minor miracle ?"
8123,"it ass a grea contribution to the game so i guess so , if we translate it to religion nit makes sense , the 2220 can translate into a player , a sacrifice to the gods"
8124,"but , it seems so random . why was georgia tech worth while on that day and cumberland worth nothing . it woud be lie worshiping dice . or . . . back to tom brady and past performance is indicative of future result ."
8125,do you think he will be around the nfl a while more ? he is one if the most dedicated players
8126,"ish ave come to believe that tom will be around . it is true , dedication and commitment ."
8127,"i agree , 40 years old is a bit old for the game but he was great on the last super now , so yeah . i think we have bad for a while"
8128,maybe tom is in it for the money . he seems to be transitioning int a self hop nutrition our . if there is more cash in that then no more football ?
8129,"thats a valid theory although he already makes a lot of money , i think its great how he has so ha positive perception of sports and how they can help us become better persons overall k , i agree with him , sports bring she best version of yourself"
8130,i like the technology involved . the nfl may make advances in closed head injuries . there are tracking chips in the players shoulder pads .
8131,"yesh footballs also have tracking chips , a lot of interesting data i taken out o them ."
8132,how familiar are you with football ?
8133,"hi the , yes i know some stuff about it . . do you have a favorite player ?"
8134,i follow teams more like the patriots
8135,nice . so are you a fan of tom brady ?
8136,hi among some others like green ellis
8137,"benjarvus is a legend , the guy never fumbled the ball in his career"
8138,indeed
8139,do you know what the highest score in a game has been so far ?
8140,probably over 150 ?
8141,yeah it was 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
8142,man how good was gt and bad was cumberland
8143,yeah exactly . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
8144,yes and green ellis
8145,"they won it for the superimposed yellow line , hit has been awesome for us as watchers"
8146,i must be because it is so hard to digest all the action there goes on in the dozen or so minutes of live action
8147,"yeah , it is strange to think it is that short . did you know women can play in the nfl ?"
8148,thee is no written rule against it tight ?
8149,"yeah there is not . then again maybe becoming an engineer , a better idea to make a living"
8150,i mean there is significantly less chance of force retirement due to injuries
8151,"true . on another topic , do you kno couch about the big ; le ?"
8152,"not much since i currently have n't decided on a religion . n any case , thanks for chatting"
8153,i see . some here . have a good one .
8154,"hi , how are you ?"
8155,"helo ; o , i am grea ! are you an nfl fan ?"
8156,"the nfl ? the national football league ' ye , i 've heard of it . i don ' know much about the game ."
8157,do you have a favorite tea m ? there are 32 of them . choose from !
8158,i ties painful to have a favorite . to show favor would go against the way . to you have af favorite ?
8159,"i favor the vikings , b ut i like college football too . my favorite team if the iowa hawkeyes . did you know they painted their visitor locker room pink ? !"
8160,maybe they are encouraging awareness of breast cancer .
8161,"that is not at all why , but a valid point . it is psychological for calming down the other team ."
8162,"i guests everybody is calmed by pink , but it should demand time of the tragedy of cancer that strikes so many footballers ."
8163,i never knew that may male players were affected . good awareness .
8164,"breasts ar delicate things , and the pounding of the game is carcinogous . i figure that there should be a way to engineer a better beats protector ."
8165,that is why engineers make more money overtime than nfl players
8166,the engineers have not come up with a breast cancer inventor breast play . they need to get going on that . he players need it . iowa demands it .
8167,"for sure ! engineers have created chips to put in shoulder players for data purposes , so its a start ."
8168,"if the can detect breast cancer , it is a goo start . chips area cleaver , maybe clever enough to spread pink awareness ."
8169,"hve you been affected by breast cancer ? you sound li , e a good advocate"
8170,i thank do that i have n't been . i wore the beast protectors while i played and have not suffered like s many others .
8171,"i am happy to hear that . speaking lof women , did you know they could play in the nfl if they were good enough ?"
8172,i think that would occur a tremendous risk of breast cancer on their part . they should take care to avoid that risk . carcinogens abound in pro football .
8173,i agree as wel ? do you watch espn ?
8174,"they are the ons taht came up with the pink line to pause awareness about beast cancer , right ?"
8175,"yellow line on tv , but pink during october i believe , good chatting with you !"
8176,hey there ! do you like football ?
8177,"i 'm bot nuns into sports in general , however , i did watch quit i bit when i was younger . do you like football ?"
8178,"not so much , but i know some interesting facts about football and the nfl ! for example , i just learner da little we ago that u of iowa 's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink !"
8179,"that 's surprising to me ! i wonder if it has to do with school colors ? or , do you think it was previously the omen 's locker room ?"
8180,"i think it probably was meant to e a joke , sine pink is typically though to be a ' feminine e ' color . however , i ind of like the idea of football and pink ! breaking down gender norms !"
8181,"agreed ! i was fascinated to learn that the nfl actually allows female players , if they meet teh league 's eligibility . wonder if any have tried out ?"
8182,"i have no idea . i 'm guessing not probably just because of enigma , unfortunately . but props to the nfl q i definitely think we need to see more ladies playing football !"
8183,"yes ! i heard that many people were actually rooting against brady ' ? s team , because they 're in of over them winnings all the time . he sure works har though , it seems ."
8184,"i think so , too . but there are othe good players as well . i guess rb benjarvis greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career ."
8185,"pretty impressive . i know they get paid a lot for home skills , but id you realize that top bowlers in the 60 's made time as much as football stars then ?"
8186,i ad no idea ! that 's quite interesting . i wonder why . . . any ideas ?
8187,the only thing i can come up with is that bowling was more popular because ot had been around ; longer ?
8188,"probably . i think a ot of things were more popular back then . diners , roller skating , church , the bible . . . things ike that ."
8189,"good point . funny that you mentioned the bible , as i recently learned that jefferson used a razor to cut outs supernatural parts of the bible ."
8190,"s weird ! i mean , i guess thins were just different back then . i guess before 1963 , every student was required to read the bible the they were na elementary student ."
8191,"wow , that just would cause such a uproar today . funny how what society approved of changes in such a relatively short timeframe ."
8192,"i guess not everyone was super religious , though . apparently roosevelt and john quincy adams did n't use the bible at their swearingin ceremonies ."
8193,very interesting . did you a know that the tower of babel is probably based on ar real building in iraq ?
8194,"hmm , dod not know that ! but it makes once . even though times are changing , i guess the bible is still the bestselling boo box all time ."
8195,"yeah , but i bet tom brady hopes his books ill surpass tha t !"
8196,"and i hope for his sake , taht it might ! t his conversation was enlightening . enjoy your night !"
8197,thank you too !
8198,maybe i 'll start watching the nfl more often now !
8199,me too .
8200,"hi there , do you watch the nfl ?"
8201,nfl ? the national footbal league ? j do n't know much but it . you ?
8202,yeah i watch it quite a bit . i you know u of iowa painted their visitor locker room pink ?
8203,i heard about that . i wonder if it effective a tall . other teams would probalby do the same if it worked .
8204,yeah exactly that is a good point . did you know there are only 11 minutes of active game play ?
8205,that is so little ! i guess that is a lot of skating up and moving the chains and stuff .
8206,yeah exactly it . do you know hat the highest score in cllebef football game is ?
8207,i imagined it could get quite high . probably from long ago .
8208,yeah it was 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland
8209,"that seems unfair . a lot about football seems unfair . for example , new orleans saints cheerleaders ca n't eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player . if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave ."
8210,"tha it so wrong and sexist , i can not believe they still hav that rule . did you know esp noon an emmy once ?"
8211,i believe it . espn has been aloud for a long tiem . they should have won at least once .
8212,yeah they have and they won it for the superimposed yellow line
8213,for a long on the screen ? that seems a bit too simple to deserve an award .
8214,yeah i know butt hey you it after all . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
8215,never heard of him . is he famous ? what does he do ?
8216,yeah eh is a former qb who never fumbled the ball in his career
8217,wow . impressive . never ? i guess every defender must have been coming are him . i hope he got a raise or a bonus or something .
8218,i hope so too honestly . there seems to be no rule that prevents women from playing in the nfl
8219,"the rule might not be there , but i think that a is still very high physically . anyway , thanks for the chat !"
8220,"same here , have a great one ."
8221,hi . do you like football ?
8222,i have a passing knowledge
8223,same here . the highest scoring game very was 2220 ! that just have been something to watch !
8224,either hte winning team was as tthat good or the losing team was unjust that bad
8225,or both ! did you know in the nfl hey only play for around 11 minutes per game e ?
8226,ya . that sure is a lot of action in so little lime
8227,"there are no rules against women in ten fl , i wonder if we will see what anytime soon ?"
8228,perhaps the rest why we do n't see them now is because the requirements inherently disqualify most ?
8229,"you 're probably right . some of teh league still has sexist rules about cheerleaders , though , not allowing them to eat in the same restaurant as the players !"
8230,i wonder why . i seems unfairly biased
8231,"yeah , it 's a strange rule . did you watch the playoffs and super bowl this year ?"
8232,the opening was a bit disappointing compared to years ; prior
8233,team . the playoffs were nerve wrecking to me due to fumbles and such . did you know there is a player who never fumbled the bal his whole career ?
8234,then you must like green ellis
8235,"yeah . talk about pressure not o mess up your record , though ! speaking of records , i ca n't believe the patriots have won 6 out of 8 super bowls ! that 's pretty amazing"
8236,that is why they are like the lannisters of football
8237,"between brady and their coach who has won teh most playoff games ever , no other team as a shot ."
8238,that is not to mention that the team is full of talent like previously green ellis
8239,very true . brady has developed a method called the tbs method that teaches people ' how to live like tom ' . it 's been nice chatting with you . hae a great weekend !
8240,i are . the same to you as well l
8241,thank you !
8242,"hi , how are you tonight ? do your was the bible ? did you know that before 1963 , it was not uncommon for us students to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education ?"
8243,i actually do read it and know that . i 'm guessing that tradition ended around 'the time people protested about prayer in schools
8244,"that woud mine sense . separation of church and state . speaking of which , presidents teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams did not use a bible at their swearingin ceremonies . i think they swore on the constitution ."
8245,interesting . yet ther recent ones hve all sworn on the bible
8246,"yes , i thin they tradition ncis important in today 's political climate . in colonial times it was different . thomas jefferson created his own version of the bible . cutting cout hte supernatural ' parts , such as the miracle sand the resurrection nah e wanted to see religion in humans terms ."
8247,"which probably did more damage in the end to himself . it would be awesome to see the ermeenanki building in person , since many think it 's the referenced tower of babel"
8248,that would make sense . i could see places in the bible having connection to places in the middle east .
8249,it jokes make sends a it 's strange how the root for apple and evil us from the same word in latin a that 's probably why people assume that eve ate an apple
8250,"true . easy to get confused . on a different topic , do you follow the nfl ?"
8251,"i dont ' follow it too closely , but i heard tom brady released a boo thati as been dubbed the ' athlete 's bible '"
8252,that interesting . a bible for athletes . i do n't know uc about the book or brady .
8253,i just know of his due to the patriots and their constant winning . do you follow any of the 32 teams in the nfl ?
8254,"i usually follow around the playoffs , if at all . i do n't have much time to watch . do you have a chance e ?"
8255,ever ' e in the same boat with the playoffs aspect . i ca n't keep up on 16 games in the regular season l but i can do a few times and the super bowl
8256,tha playoffs seem to hav more energy . i figure it ' e the time to pay attention . an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . i wonder what the total fo the season is .
8257,considering that 32 teams play for 16 weeks notch counting the single elimination playoff games including the wildcards . . . that 's mat hi do n't want to do
8258,"nfl uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads to record a player 's moves on the field . they are so located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , ball speed and location . i wonder how much data that generates per season n ."
8259,"if they 're smart enough to create the chips , there must e system , ms in place to keep track o fit all . hopefully the engineers who came up with that area thee ones making more than nfl players in their comparable lifetimes"
8260,i hope so too . we need engineers more than we nerd athletes if we 're going to have a good safety .
8261,true ! although it is pretty cool that there is n't a rule that keeps women from playing . all the need to do it meet eligibility
8262,"i guess in the future we might see a woman . anyway , great chat ! have a great evening !"
8263,that would be an interesting game !
8264,"who is one of your favorite quarter , s ? mine is peyton manning but i will have to say tom brady is a close second . he is amazing !"
8265,behave respect for both those guys they are great qbs but im a steelers fan so i guess my favorite is ben right now .
8266,did ouch epa what tom brady wrote lab do . i heard it in like the ' athlete 's bible ' if there is such a thing .
8267,i di their that . i think it was just a publicity stunt . a man to maker more money .
8268,i think h eis trying o start something before he retires that he can continue . . . not like he needs the money .
8269,i guess maybe thats the case . i just dont see an athletes bible being something substantial lot just a joke view .
8270,i agree . i mean he average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay . not as much as everyone thought .
8271,yeah there is a lot of waiting around the tv for me next play . those 11 minutes area pretty exciting though .
8272,"i agree ! ! did you know that the nfl uses tracking chips to record speed , rotation of the ball and so many other things ."
8273,yeah they even put them in the players shoulder pads . technology is everywhere i guess .
8274,kind of scary ! just like ewing a end orleans saints cheerleader . if they are in a restaurant and a nfl player comes in they have to leave . that is not right !
8275,no it know . i dont see why that is should be in ; place . i can see a rule about them not dating ours something liken hat but hot allowed to be in the same place at the same time . i dont get it .
8276,i do n't either and i think it is over he top . even the nfl has no written rule against female players as long as they met the eligibility requirements .
8277,"i have heard that . hat position would a woman want to play though ? only the top . 2001 percent of men are gifted enough to play in the nfl so when a woman comes alone go wants to play too , she ' doing to be really fit nd ready"
8278,it would be hard ! ! look aw roman would probably be better off being an engineer . their average lifetime earnings are higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and mlb player !
8279,thats pretty surprising to hear . i know their are a lot of players that dont make it that bring that average down . i just figured the top earner making 20 plus illion a year would puts the nfl players over the top in that category .
8280,you would think ! i heard even 190 's top bowlers made twice as much as football stars !
8281,i believe that . bowling was a big sport back in the day ? football players didnt have th players union back then so they didnt jack nearly what they deserved . i would say now it is a little over the top though .
8282,i agree . especially if you are like the patriots benjarvus greenellis who never even fumbled one game in his nfl career .
8283,he just have done a lot of upper body strength training o be strong enough to cover fumble . either that or ne prayed hard every night .
8284,i agree ! ! hope you have a great night !
8285,"hello , how are you doing ?"
8286,"i am well . i hope you are als ! hey , do know anything about tom brady 's new book , the 1912 method ?"
8287,tom brady ? is he an author ?
8288,"of sorts . . . he is best known as the longtime qb of the new england patriots football yeah . but he is often regarded s one opt he greatest qbs the game has ever had . he is still going strong at 40 yrs old , and he has written a book explaining is approach to stay at the top of his game ."
8289,i sounds like an important book . have you read it ? i would like to hear more .
8290,"i have not read it yet , but i am very much interested i getting a copy . i am not one of those new england patriot fast hat defy brady and his coach h , belichick , or consider the patriots my religion , but i do admire anyone that ha performed at the top of their sport for so many years . 6 nfl championships is incredible ."
8291,that is incredible . he is practically a density . i guess he had earned his status in the heavens . the book is a lot tract .
8292,"i understand what 8dolatry is , and i do not approach that level of religious mean . i merely thing the phrase , ' in bil , we trust ' which is a contra or creed spoton often in boston is an earned sentiment t ."
8293,"that is good . it is important to remain humble and true . there is only on still and tom , but there is a high authority ."
8294,my wife . . . lol thomas jefferson mash ave created his own version of the bible ; but my wife would consider herself editor .
8295,thye bible did not need editing . i do n't know what he was thinking . he must have spent too much time wth the women he owned .
8296,nice . i agree on the last of need for editing the be . i was also testing regarding my wife . if ind it sad that teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams chose tc not used the bible at their inauguration .
8297,"i think that ted and john ha another agenda , one not parallel who the one set in the bible ."
8298,what is your winning on the apocrypha ? do you find any value to these works as complimentary to the canonical bible ?
8299,the word is broad and varied and it is good to look in places that others have stunned . we do not know th complete truth because it is hidden .
8300,"we see through a glass daily . . . but i find it interesting every time archaeologists find another site consistent with biblical texts . in act , they think the tower of babel was based on a real building located one hat is modern day iraq ? . interesting ."
8301,i think that is an interesting connection that help people recognize the value of the texts .
8302,"yes , and likewise , the documented historic performance of tom brady in his long , rcordsetting career in hte nfl helps people to recognize the value o his writings ."
8303,i think that his fame and notoriety can only help spread what must be a valuable insight in the usa condition .
8304,"and it helps to sell books . although brady does not seemed strapped for cash . . . th average nfl played poes nor earn as much in a career as an average beginner , but brady is an exception"
8305,brady is an exception that the engineers envy . tank you for the chat . good night .
8306,good night and ay the ball always roll your way q
8307,"are you a tom brady fan , he plays for the patriots ?"
8308,"i cant say that i am , but i respect his talent ."
8309,"yeah apparently his work ethic is off the charts . he does however c , aim that football has become his religion ."
8310,"i heard about the 12 , and the in bill we trust that a lot of fans follow ."
8311,"i know what happen to just plain old talent nd sportsmanship . one quote said that brady was kind of a messier figure . if it 's not blasphemy , it 's too lol to it !"
8312,"i know ! people idplize him ; i dont hear too muh negative about him , he seems to toe the line in terms of his behavior . bt he is no messier ."
8313,right ! hey did you know that top bowlers in the 60 's made more than top nfl players ?
8314,that is crazy . i wonder how much that was at that time . now they are joe overpaid .
8315,personally i think so esports players are over paid . that money could be taxed to pay for healthcare .
8316,"i agree . especially for only 11 minutes of live game play and week ,"
8317,i know that 's crazy to think about . i did n't know that espn won an emmy award .
8318,"neither did i , and all for that yellow like . i thought it would take al little ore than that to win an emmy , but im not the judge ."
8319,i know but i have to say that line made life a little easier . a former patriots rb haver fumbled he ball in his entire career .
8320,he is probably responsible for the huge successes that the patriots have had recently .
8321,maybe ins ome way . did you know there was a college game were the score was 2200 ?
8322,"i had heard that , georgia tech and cumberland ."
8323,wow that 's crazy i can not imagine even sitting though that game let alone playing in it . you know there n rule that says women ca n't play in the nfl ?
8324,"yeah , they say ws long as they can meet the eligibility requirements they are allowed it . whatever those are . i dont think id want to play in the nfl , i dont want to be crushed by a lineman ."
8325,right if they do it i think they should create a league like the wnba .
8326,that lol be interesting to watch . i hope if a female did make it to the nfl very would treat her better than the cheerleaders .
8327,i think they should have all male cheerleaders for the wnfl ! what do you think ?
8328,"i like i t ! thats are a few for the nfl now , but an all male bad would be gret ! it has been nice chatting but i must go . have a good day !"
8329,"hi , d o you know anything about the new england patriots and tom brady ?"
8330,"i know that tom brady has a best selling book called ' the tbs method ' , have you heard of it or read it ?"
8331,"no , but i heard it is an inspiration to us ll . did you know that brady 's coach h , renee worries about the devotion to te patriots might overshadowed other in of faith in some people ?"
8332,what ? because there ate so many fans . the patriots ?
8333,"no , because on sundays in new england people are devoted to watching the patriots and talking about the team even in church ."
8334,"oh ! wow , even when there 's only eleven minutes of live gameplay , there 's so much chatter nonstop around the game ! i also devote snl entire sunday to watching the games ! do you watch the games"
8335,"no , not on tv but i heard that some patriots try to keep their focus on faith i god rather than on the tea on sundays ."
8336,that 's good ! i wonder if those people wished that reading the bible was part of the education curriculum like prior to 1960s
8337,"that could be . hte patriots do have a number of spiritual players like matthew slated who 's known for his outfield evangleism . slated adn other patriots will be feature din football sunday , a national chrchbased event on super bowl sunday ."
8338,"oh i did n't know that . i wonder if there will be as many people tuned in compared t how many copies there has been sold of the bible , a whopping 5 billion copies !"
8339,"probably not that many since the 5 billion copy estimate has to do with from the beginning of it 's printing , ha , ha . besides that , another patriots fan and hte pastor of richmond community church in glen allen , va . say that there are faith lessons in brady 's examples he uses in hi spook ."
8340,"oh o , , yeah five billion copies is a lot ! do you know what the or faint lessons there are ?"
8341,"well , according to daniel , brady 's commitment to his craft allow him to overcome the odds . brady 's career began as a sixthroundd kraft pick and now is arguably the best at his craft ."
8342,"his story is really worth a read , i wonder if they pick that in the documentary ' tom vs . time ' , have you seen it ;"
8343,"no , i have n't seen it yet butt hat will probaby be the main focus si would think . brady coming up from the bottom to the top . actually , he 's shown the ability to rebound from adversity quite nicely ."
8344,"yeah my friend has seen it and he told me it changed his perspective on hte guy . he 's actually a very hardworking nice guy and really puts in a lot of hard work to the game , the team , and his fans . i wonder if they will get an emmy like what espn won fort he yellow line used in football games ."
8345,"that might happen o even better things . remember last year when the patriots were down 28 to 3 in the super bowl and then they came back to win the game in overtime , that was spectacular ."
8346,"oh my , that was such a great game ! i was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire tme , i wonder if that 's why i was so disappointed in this year 'd game . i think people who placed bets on the game would 've preferred the boring game thoug h ."
8347,"yes , that 's probalby true , save the blood pressure and all that . but really , brady is a great example of what you can do if you 're really committed . it seems tat brady is totally committed o his tbs method and he is really sincere ."
8348,"yeah , that 's the message i 'm getting as well . do you know what the 12 stands for in the 2012 ?"
8349,"it would think dig means 12 methods like the title shows because he 's talking about a number of areas . in addition to spiritual beliefs , he 's talking about good nutrition , fitness , and list of other attributes to maintain his lifestyle ."
8350,hello ! are you a fan of tom brady ?
8351,"i would n't call myself a fan , but i respect him as one of the greats . he 's in such great health to be in the league as long as he has been ."
8352,i agree . i didnt like him until i watched his documentary tom vs time . i became a big fan after watching that . it shows how much work he puts into his craft .
8353,iv ' e heard of the documentary but have never watched it . i liked watching the patriots when benjarvus greenellis played for him . he was a solid running back and actually has never fumbled the football in his fl career !
8354,"thats ' incredible ! 3rd you know they put tracking chips in the footballs to track the data such as velocity , etc . on them ?"
8355,8 did not know that . that 's probably why players get fined so much for throwing them into that stands . i heard that they laser hasve tracking chips embedded in the players shoulder pads to record they 're every move .
8356,crazy how the game has come along technology wise . i wish the actual gameplay was longer thoug hot here 's only 11 minutes of actual gameplay of an average nfl game ;
8357,"i know , that seems so short . it 's 2 hours and 49 minutes of crap . hey should get some hornet o ploy , teh could make gameplay last longer . i mean there 's no rules against them playing ."
8358,i agree ! the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average nfl adn lol players . that 's surprising .
8359,"it is pretty surprising , but i guess you have to consider that most engineers work well into their 60s or even 70s . the average football player only play for 3 years ."
8360,true . i wonder if other people outside of the u . s . get confused wheat hey hear football since that 's the word they use to all soccer .
8361,i think a lot do . it just need weird behaving o specif . although gridiron football has an ice ring to it .
8362,yes it does . i hate 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars of that era . things have changed since then .
8363,yesh htey have . that 's weird to think . did you know that iowa 's visiting locker room is completely painted pink . i wonder how many times that has backfired on them ?
8364,lol . maybe they did it to support breast chaser awareness ?
8365,"that would b epa good excuse . i heard that espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow first down line , that was an emmy well won ."
8366,interesting ! the highest score ever in a football game was in 1916 when georgia tech beat cumberland 220 !
8367,"that 's crazy , u wonder gift hats ' when georgia tech learned the triple option and it 's effectiveness ."
8368,not sure ! how many teams are there in the nfl ?
8369,"i believe i'ts 32 ,"
8370,thanks ! i wasnt sure . nice chatting with you today !
8371,it was nice chatting with you too . have a great day !
8372,"hi there , do you watch the nfl ?"
8373,"yes i do . i enjoyed the superbowl , and watching brady end company winn their sixth nfl chmapioship"
8374,". me too , i like hat . did you know brady has written a book now as well ?"
8375,ia that he tbs method ?
8376,"yes and taht is also his lifestyle brand and there seems to be a documentary in the works , tom vs time"
8377,"oh , yeah , is that the facebook series ?"
8378,"yes that one . i you know waht his favorie ice cream flavor is , as a fun fact ?"
8379,i do n't . some kind of vegan something i imagine ?
8380,"ia m not sure about i being vegan but the flavor is avocado , still pretty healthy"
8381,"nice . i undrwtan that he is on a spiritual quest of some sort , ws he dedicates himself to his craft ."
8382,yes it seems that way . did you know women can play in the nfl ?
8383,"yeah , i guess more is no rule against them , but they still have to meet eligibility requirements ."
8384,"young ever know i guess , time will tell . did you hear about them in tracking chips on the players while in the field ?"
8385,"i knew they track he balls , it they track players too ?"
8386,yes it is a their shoulder are and they are tracking stuff like velocity and rotation and such
8387,seems like al ot of expense for a game where the average playtime is only 11 minutes per game .
8388,"yeah it sure does . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
8389,"i do , although i ahve more knowledge of the new testament , less of the old , and even less of she apocrypha . you ?"
8390,oh i see . i do not know much but just some facts . i know that it is one of the most influential book in history and sold 5 billion copies so far
8391,"it used to be common for school children to read from the bible . the days , lawsuits have cursed that ."
8392,yes that is true . it seems jefferson created its own version of the bible .
8393,good morning .
8394,good morning ! are you a football fan ?
8395,yeah i am . how bout you . i read somewhere that the nfl has no rule agains female player . what do you think about thaat .
8396,"well some colleges have female kickers already , so that seems reasonable . i have to admit that i really only watch the superbowl . my husband and son karen ' really interested m , so its just not on in ou house ."
8397,i watch every sunday . im a steelers fan . my wife roots for the patriots just to pick on me . lol . i think a female could probably be a kicker or a punter in hte nfl . im not sure about any other positions .
8398,"my husband liked the steelers i college . the patriots , though . . . no . there 's a ew documentary about tom brady and ho whe combines football and religion ."
8399,i just dont vp how the two mix to b honest . except they both take place on sunday .
8400,"lol . , i actually laughed out loud , by the way ! , 've heard that after he retire strom football he may be planning some kind of ministry that is combined wth nutrition nad exercise . s columnist at the boston globe called kit a cult !"
8401,"i can see the importance of staying physically fit . i bust went think it should be mixed with religion . i think he is just trying to be so , e extra money off his popularity ."
8402,"that seems likely . we often think of nfl players as making lots of , but their careers are very short . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are actually much higher than that of an nfl o mlb player ."
8403,yeah but the number are just of the average player . most players dont play very long and dont make a whole lot of money in football when you think about a lifetime . thy only a play a year and make like half a silicon dollars . an engineer has to work his whole life for that . i think you would be better of for play football and then finish school to be a engineer .
8404,"given the high rates of 've , i 'll take the lifetime as a engineer any day . it 'd weird how much trauma there is i such a short time on the field . did you know that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual game play ?"
8405,i did hear that . thos 11 minutes are exciting touch .
8406,"yeah . also , an engineer would make half w million dollars in 58 years , so that 's not too shabby . especially when you consider that the football player and the engineer both had to go to college anyway before they got heir respective jobs ."
8407,"that is true , but if you become one of the greats in football . you will be remembered forever . not to many engineers can say that ."
8408,"well , some people in your own country might rememebr ou forever , i guess . gridiron footbal , l is mostly played in the us . i remember whe ny parents lived in england or af ew years and they were really surprised to learn tha much of hte rest of the world does n't watch it ."
8409,yeah the rest of the world takes soccer very seriously . they actually call it football . i
8410,that 's true . the places like australia use teh word ' football ' for rugby .
8411,i dont know much about rugby . i know the ball the use is similar to the america football .
8412,"yeah , me neither . my kid 's school has a team , but i 've never seen them play ;"
8413,maybe after that you could take me out to dinner and you can tell me all about the life of a nobleman .
8414,"um , wow , tht 's . . . random ! nice talking to you !"
8415,accident . sorry about that . trying to do two things at once . lol . have a good one .
8416,"do you have knowledge of ho tom brady eat s , exercises and rests ?"
8417,i do not . i would imagine that he has a pretty intense enimen .
8418,tenure ws a tv special that claims the football is his religion and so he lives every day to be able to continue ton play a long time . he is now 40 .
8419,i expect that he will retire in the next few years then . i heard that he wrote a book called the tbs method . have you heard of it ?
8420,"yes . i have . of course his wife is into the healthy eating lifestyle too . deep chopin di the tv series . i dont now brough about him to feel positive or negative , but i lean negative ."
8421,i do too . mostly because of the cheating . are you a football fan ?
8422,"i really follow college football , i went to oklahoma and follow that team . i love the yellow line that espn invented to sow the line to gain for a first down ."
8423,ish and they won an emmy for tha . can you imagine watching a game without that line ?
8424,"not anymore . globally , a lot of different games are considered to be footbal l ."
8425,that is true . i 'm referring to american football in his we . do you know what hte highest score in a football am lever was ?
8426,"well , my jv team was beaten by another varsity team by 740 , and oklahoma bey texas a and m 70 once ."
8427,wow ! those are extremely high scoring games . the highest every was in 1916 and it was 2220 ! how is that even possible ?
8428,"i can not imagine . in the two games i mentioned , they did not stop the clock in the second half to shorten the game . have you heard that the iowa visitor ' z dressing room is painted pink ."
8429,i did not . is that supposed to be does kind of psychological game ?
8430,there have been studies that prove ethan weight lifters can not lift as much in a pink room . so it is another move to i games .
8431,wow ! i have never heard of that . very interesting . do you remember the patriots rb benjarvus greenellis ?
8432,i do n't . was he distinctive ?
8433,yes he never fumbled a footbal his entire career r !
8434,that is a distinction ! there are 2 germs in hte nfl so it is amazing to have that distinction .
8435,i agree . did you also know that i nthe 60 's top bowlers made more than top football players ?
8436,"the nfl has one a great job of marketing ti increase their incomes . there are 54 players on each tema and 325 was , so now over 150 people probaby make more than the top bowlers . nice chat ."
8437,the you into tom brady ?
8438,"ca n't say that i am , i know of him and what he does , but that is about it ."
8439,he has a book out called ' athlete 's bible ' . and are making comments about it being gspiritulaly involved .
8440,it seems difficult to equate spirituality wath footbal . they seem opposite to mr .
8441,it 's mainly th evans that safe brady as a messier and coach belichick as some kind of daily . the say ' in bill we trust ' .
8442,i know some people take it do far . when you have fans it 's amazing what you can sell to them . if mr brady sold avocado ice cream wath his face on the front they 'd think it was the best favor very .
8443,"taht as n't sound good . bob ryan , a former columnist , said that it was ' cultlike ' ."
8444,"same celebrities believe that just because they are good at one thing , in this case football , it makes the experts on everything , and they want to tell us how o behave ."
8445,"i agree , that is annoying . i mainly like college football . my alma mater ran up the score on cumberland 2220 in 1916 . hot terribly proud of that . . ."
8446,if i were on the losing side i think i would have give put playing . maybe they could have turned to the bible .
8447,"maybe . at least cumberland proabably did n't have a pin locker room like that s u . of iowa . in 1916 , they probably did't have a love from at all ."
8448,"i do n't think they were in for those silly games back then , probably more respectful to the other team ."
8449,probably . . . did you know the nfl had no written rule that women cant ' play ; ?
8450,"they probably think they do n't need it . some guys get worked up if they hear a woah is going to take part in something g , but if they are good enough and want to do it let them ."
8451,"i agree . it 's not that big of a deal . here 's another interesting football fact , there are only 1 actual minutes of gameplay in an average nfl game ."
8452,"i never really enjoyed watching footbal ; l . i think that might be the main reason , i do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for the hours for just 11 minute sofa ploy ."
8453,k like documentaries . i would like to see one about finding thet power of babel in iraq .
8454,"my mental image of that is a very tall building , if it existed it was probably a lot smaller than i 'm hiking ."
8455,"it 's probably a bunk of hubble due to recent bombing . it 's interesting that thomas jefferson cut ot the parts in his biber that referred to the ' supernatural ' , e . g . , miealces , ."
8456,i 've heard that before . i 'd have to see a copy . must just have looked like a shredder book . funny thing to do .
8457,"yeah , i 'd like to that more about his reasoning . thanks for the chat ; you were excellent ."
8458,had to believe that the patriots just wo nthe super bowl again if i wonder how tom brady is still so good given hi stage .
8459,"good morning , i love tom brady , h e 's like the energized bunny , he just keeps going and going and going . . . lol did n't realize he was so spiritual , did you ?"
8460,i thought football was his religion . at least that 's what his friend gotham chopin says .
8461,"well , he said in an version o 'the spiritual episode , that hed hoss what to know why we 're here , where we 're gong , trying to find that deeper purpose . tht 's pretty spiritual tom e ."
8462,i guess you 're right . have you read tom 's book ' the tbs method ' ?
8463,"no , have you ?"
8464,yeah i have . i'ts very interesting stuff . not sure how he can enjoy avocado ice cream though . i find it . of gross .
8465,"ooh , that sounds o goose ! do you watch , such football ?"
8466,i aoc hit most weekends . i prefer the and to college footbal color any other league .
8467,"i was shocked to find out that an average nfl game , only had 1 minutes of live gameplay ."
8468,they do keep the time running while the teams are setting up and calling a new play a lo seo i guess i'ts not too surprising . they still earn a lot of money for the little work they do .
8469,how true . i read somewhere that the top bowlers in the 1960s made twice as much as the top football stars .
8470,"that shows how quickly things can change . moss pro football players do n't have to careers , i wonder how much they make compared to other professions over their lifetime ."
8471,"well , i also read that average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earning of an average nfl player ."
8472,that 's pretty interesting . do you read 'the bible much or are you not religious ?
8473,i try to read a little every night before bed . a habit my grandma taught me whee kid was a kid . do you ?
8474,i read it occasionally . in the 60 's it was pretty common for students to be required to read it . how things change .
8475,"yes , i think if we went back to tha practice , alot of thins would def be different in america ."
8476,maybe you 're right ? did you know that thomas jefferson created his own version of the bible ?
8477,"yeah , i heard he took a razor and cut out the parts he considered ' supernatural ' ."
8478,that 's quite an interesting change to make . it was a pleasure talkin do you . have a great day !
8479,do you enjoy sports ?
8480,i do n't know much about that sports . do you like the sports ?
8481,i have a passing knowledge of football
8482,i know that passing is used a lot in football . in this you1 r can expert ?
8483,i would n't say expert but i have a basic understanding
8484,ok . that is good . i ythinjt hat many peoples in the us like the football . it is a popular game .
8485,it is surprising how much people invest into it considering each gmail is only a on or so minutes of real action .
8486,other like the action and the violence . it is exciting to see men in combat to the death . the outcomes re watered as well it think .
8487,"true . it is probably due to injuries that force early retirement that based on average lifetime earnings , engineers get better paid than players ."
8488,"engineers out be very smart , maybe some og the most sad tpepolple . they earn the money for being smart . i think it is better for life ."
8489,at least football players are better paid than bowlers like in the uk 1900s
8490,bowlers do noth ave tbh same job risks . i think they should be paid less .
8491,teh ar now
8492,that i good . is the bible an important part of the football lame ?
8493,are you referring to the actual bible or the book released by brady ?
8494,i mean teh ome that everyone has in their bedroom .
8495,well i think that it may be since the mental fortitude that comes from religion can beam n important factor of a players performance
8496,"i understand . in all life , the strength of the inside helps with the outside ."
8497,"indeed . even if you are physically read , if you are n't mentally , that can make all the difference"
8498,"that is one . the preparation or the football must start inside , then make its way to the outside for the world . thank you for the chatting . if is a good night ."
8499,same to you .
8500,"i there , do you watch the nfl ?"
8501,"yes i do , what do you think of tom brady ?"
8502,"i think he is a pretty decent player . so was the former qb for patriots , benjarvus"
8503,i thinkk considering how many super bowl rings brady had he is better than decent .
8504,yeah that is true . benjarvus on the other name is the only guy in nfl o have never fumbled a ball .
8505,that is impressive do you know how many gems h employed in ?
8506,"i a knot sure but over his entire career , that must have been quite a few games there ."
8507,"that is impressive , did you know tha 'the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live play time ?"
8508,yeah and yet we are glue duo the t for house to watch a single game
8509,"that is the amazing part , interesting that the complain about how little action there is in baseball ."
8510,yeah exactly . do you hear about them placing tracking ships in the players now ;
8511,"i was reading bout that , i wonder if they do that during the game or only practice ."
8512,i bet you they a it for both . they need to track lots of stats like velocity and rotation and such and they will likely need the averages of those
8513,w live in amazing times . i can see where that would be useful . if a running back is getting tire during he game they know rights way
8514,yeah we sure do . did you know women can play to in the nfl ?
8515,i have read about a couple but overall i just do n't think it 's a good idea .
8516,i would be curious to see that happen . i guess time will tell . did you know about that weird rule for the new orleans cheerleaders ?
8517,"no , i had n't heard about that , please tell me ."
8518,well they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players
8519,np kidding . i guess may be they do n't want them to get too close or something .
8520,"maybe but still , the most is that they have to leave the restaurant mi day if the players walk in"
8521,it seems like that 's carrying it a little too far .
8522,it is not fair at all . i hope they get rid of it soon .
8523,hello ! are you a fan of tom brady ?
8524,"hi ! i actually am a huge fan ! in fact , i want to follow thet 912 method also known as the ' athlete 's bible ' so i can be in top shape like he is ! what about you ?"
8525,k 've heard o fit but have n't looked into it . i became a fan of his after watching his ' tom vs . time ' documentary . have you seen it ?
8526,"i have n't seen it yet , unfortunately , but i do know a litte bit about it . i 'm fact , i love what brady says in the first episode : ' if you 're going to compete against me , you better be willing o give up your like . . m because i 'm giving up i . ' that is powerful !"
8527,you 'll have to watch it . total respect for him seeing howe such work he puts it his woke during eh offseason . i think you can watch it on facebook watch .
8528,i 'll definitely do that . it 'll help get me by during the nfl offseason . i ca n't believe the regular season is only 17 weeks from september to december . i truly flies by !
8529,ye sit does ! they should lengthen the season by a month and ten the 32 teams can get more off weeks during the season .
8530,"agreed . i mean , surprisonlvy enough , the games are too short as it is seeing as ow the average game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
8531,i know that 's crazy . do you know what the highest football score ever is ?
8532,it was a game between georgia tech and cumberland back in 1913 . georgia tech actually son 2220 . can you imagine seeing that ? wow !
8533,that must have been a score on every play for georgia tech ! lol in the 1960 's top bowlers made twice as much s top football stars . times have changed since then .
8534,"so true . but even today , engineers make more human the average lifetime earnings of both mlb and nfl players ! wonder if they made more than pro bowlers back ten ?"
8535,lo good question . rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the ball once during his career . that 's impressive .
8536,really ? that takes serious talent and skill ! wonder how he would play if he had to sit int he university of iowa 's pink painted visiting football teams 's locker room ? hat has to feel insulting . ha !
8537,lol maybe they did it to support breast cancer awareness ?
8538,"let 's hope so ! ha ! on a similar note , women actually are n't forbidden from playing on the nfl as long as they meet the eligibility requirements . wonder why we have n't seen any female players signed by any teams yet ?"
8539,"i do n't know . i 'm sure we 'll see on there in the next few years . did you know they use tracking chips inside the footballs to track velocity , rotation , etc . ? that seems like a bit to much science to me ."
8540,"ha ! agreed . they also place clips in the shoulder pads as wel to record the every move of a player as well ! it ish nigh tec , right ?"
8541,crazy ! did you watch the super bowl ? it is usually held on the first sunday in february .
8542,"i missed it sadly . i was reading the bible that day . spekainh of the bible , cna you believe it 's considered the best selling and most influential books of all time and over 5 billion copies have been sold ?"
8543,i believe if ! i read it a few times a week ! it was nice chanting with you today !
8544,"hello , do you like avocado ice cream ? evidently , it 's the of the web things tom brady likes ."
8545,"er l . , . dunno , never really tried it . i 'd b willing to give it a spoonful even though it does n't sound too appealing . lol . that , tom brady 's an interesting character . i was reading somewhere he consider football to be his religion it i knew some guy in texas that were like that q"
8546,"weird . maybe he should get a copy of hamas jefferson 's bible , e , and give it a read ."
8547,"maybe , although i dunno i fthere'sd anything about football in the 's bible . . hehe . ' thou shall not fumble ! '"
8548,surely someone checked those trackers in his footballs for the proper inflation . .
8549,"yeah , i heard about hat . . they also keep track of where htey 're going and how fast and stuffy . i guess they need all that to compete accurate play stats . plus thy put them in players ' shoulder pads to track their movements as well ."
8550,do they have them on the cheerleaders s well ? so they know which restaurant theyd re in ?
8551,"that i could n't tell ya . i 'd hope not , as tht would be a bit creepy , imo ? ."
8552,"how lester re they going to know that a cheerleader is at a restaurant , one of the players are at ?"
8553,no idea . hey it you know the visitors locker room at u of iowa is painted pink ? i think that 's their way of trying to psych four ' the other team . . .
8554,"that amy have worked decades ago . there days , i do n't think the players care . they probably find i soothing . maybe cumberland would have benefited from a soothing , pink locker room when they lost 2220 ."
8555,"dunno . . . they did an experiment where they found that weight lifters would n't life as much when placed in a pink room . but , that was like twenty years ago , so maybe the effect has worn off on people 's minds . wow , that 's quit do loss ! makes you wonder if they were even trying !"
8556,"with scores like that , i can see why bowlers in the 60 's made more than football players ."
8557,"do you think a woman could be a football player ? there 's actually no rules in the nfl against it , so long as they meet the physical requirements . . ."
8558,"why not ? many highschool have female kickers . a song as the eligibility requirements and met , they should have a chance ."
8559,"dunno , if my daughter were playing football , id ' constantly worry bout her getting tackled ! but yeah , i see what you 're saying there ."
8560,"there are coed teams in my county . the girls are way tougher on the field than the boys are . i would n't want mine to be a cheerleader , especially not for the saints ."
8561,"oh , really ? which country i that , if you dont mind me asking ?"
8562,county . k live in the us .
8563,"county ! sorry , misread hat ! lol . here 's something interesting , for as long as they games last , there 's only actually about 1 minute of actual gameplay bt hat owns hey spend a lot of time just getting into position and stuff . . . weird , i h ?"
8564,not aww weird as espn winning an emmy for superimposing a yellow line .
8565,"oh , yeah , think i read about that somewhere . i remember hack when all they had were the white ' chain ' lines and joe montana doing commentary . . . ' ; and then he runs to here , passes the ball , here ! ' hehe"
8566,that sound bizarre . is the where the term ' gridiron ' football comes from ?
8567,"that i would not tell you . i 'd have to google it ! although it does make it sound tough , does n't it ? the gridiron ! !"
8568,"i honestly coudl care elses , as i would take a engineer over a baller anyway . they make more money , let"
8569,"yeah , but does that include all the money you get fro sweet endorsement deals ? : ,"
8570,"thank you for chatting with m e , have a wonderful night ."
8571,"hey , you too ! have a good one !"
8572,thanks .
8573,stay safe ! weather 's been kind of crazy in some areas !
8574,"it sure ahs . thankfully , we arent ' in the where there is flooding ."
8575,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
8576,the nfl ? the national footbal league ? is that still at his ?
8577,yeah teh nfl . do you know how many teams are there ?
8578,"more than a dozen , i 'm sure . i thought most of them went abnkupt during the great recession . huh . i guess i was wrong . how many are there ?"
8579,well currently there are 32 teams .
8580,32 seems a bit excessive . are they planning on eliminating a couple ? seems only fair . people ought to be doing things on a sunday .
8581,"well , we can watch if we wat and if not we go do other things i guess . do you know what the highest score is in football ?"
8582,"the highest possible score in footbal would be infinity , i guess . how high does the storyboard go ? maybe that ? s thiel limit ."
8583,"smell , the highest one recorded was 222 when georgia tech beat the cumberland"
8584,teh storyboard must have gone up to 999 ten . ; that 's a great score ! georgia tech must have been proud of themselves . did the other school just quit football out lof despair ? they should have .
8585,"no i do not think they did , maybe it was not the ray that day . do you ever watch espn ?"
8586,"is that the spanish footbal channel ? no , i do n't ."
8587,it is an american one and they won an award in for creating the superimposed yellow line
8588,"they got an award for discovering a yellow line ? the line was discovered by the ancient grenades . it might not have been yellow , it why does the color matter ?"
8589,well it is more visible on the tv screen and does not blend with the background do you can follow the game better
8590,"oh , so espn , not the spanish ome , got it award for the wellness . i see . they discovered that yellow is easier to see on the tv . what else did espn discover ? oxygen ?"
8591,nope just the yellow line . did you know women can play in the nfl if they choose to ?
8592,"women could many thing his they chose to . i figure one day , a player is going ron take soft his helmet , and press , it was a woman al along ."
8593,"well maybe , a nd why not , maybe it even makes the game more interesting . did you har about that rule for teh new orleans cheerleaders ?"
8594,the cheerleaders have rules ? i thought they just cheered .
8595,well whose one cannon year in the same restaurant at the football players . pretty sad rule .
8596,"hey there how often do you read the bible , i fat alll ?"
8597,"hello , how are you , yea i do . how abou thou ?"
8598,"ya i 'm good , how often do you read it ? i'ts cool that jefferson actually made his own version of the bible"
8599,"that 's interesting , or that teddy roosevelt and john adams did not use it at their swearing in ceremonies ."
8600,"no that is weird , they 're the only ones who did n't use it either , why do you think jefferson took out all the supernatural parts ?"
8601,"have no idea , never knew that ! that do you think ?"
8602,"ya i do n't know maybe he wanted a more historical version of just verified facts or something , did you learn about the bible in elementary school ?"
8603,"yes , i di and at home . do you like football ?"
8604,"ya i like it , i really like tom brady have you read his new book the tbs method ?"
8605,"no , but have heard o fit , have you ? any good ? did n't realize the average nfl live game play is only 11 minutes ."
8606,"i have n't , it has good reviews thouhg , and ya that is so short ! crazy that a team scored 2220 in that much time haha"
8607,"that seems too long g , but then again it was 1916 ."
8608,"yeah i wish they had that on video , would you watch football games with women players ?"
8609,"i do n't know , i probably would check it out , for the sake of the game . its ur it would enjoy az much . i think its too rough for women . but should be allowed to play ."
8610,"yeah i do n't know ow that would go , butt hey should be allowed if they are good enough , im an engineer and i guess i make more in my lifetime than an average nfl player makes , fool !"
8611,"lol , really . oh yeah , the average lifetime earning is higher than the average nfl player !"
8612,"yup good to know haha , do you like the site ? i do n't like how they treat their cheer leaders"
8613,"i know , that is crazy . at least have some kind of plan before hand so they are n't in the same restaurant . guess they think its too much togetherness . lol"
8614,"yea h , made it was cheerleaders hat painted that one lower room pink as protest haha ."
8615,"yes , that could eb ! what a joke ! thinking those tracking chips help a lot ! good chat ! !"
8616,ya i hope so ! i should have used my bowling hills in the 60s ' to make 2x as much as football players back ten
8617,"hi there , do you watch teh snl ?"
8618,i do ! are you a fan of tom brady ?
8619,"hi there , he is one of y favorite players . do you know the former b of patriots , benjarvus ?"
8620,i remember him . i do n't think he ever fumbled during his career .
8621,"yeah , what a talent . do you know why u of iowan painted their visitor locker room pink ?"
8622,maybe to support breast cancer awareness ?
8623,"maybe , i am not sure . do you watch the espn much ?"
8624,i do . they once won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line that represented the first down line .
8625,yeah pretty cool to get an award for that . do you no that the highest score in football history during a game is ?
8626,i 'm not sure . who was it .
8627,it was georgia tec who scored 222 against cumberland 0
8628,holes moreso ! i bet that was a long game for cubmer.and . un the 1960 's bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars .
8629,"how times have change da bt even now , engineers still make more over their lifetime"
8630,probably because they have longer careers . did you kno wthe are 32 teams int he nfl ?
8631,"yeah i think that would explain it . yup all 32 of them and they p , ay for 17 weeks ."
8632,here is an average of only 11 minutes of actual gameplay during a game . crazy .
8633,"that is crazy , so short . did you know women can play too ?"
8634,"i think there 's now bitten rule that is against having female players . di you know that they use tracking chips inside of the footballs to collect data like velocity , rotation , etc . on the , ?"
8635,yeah and i hope they can use those data somehow to make the game safer adn reduce the number of concussions
8636,yes . i agree . did you know the bible is the highest selling book of all time with over 5 billion copies sold ?
8637,"wow taht is a lot of books but i can not say that i am surprised , a lot of people believe in it ."
8638,do you think sports can bring people of different opinions and religion together ?
8639,i think it can be as source of a common ground
8640,it interesting that some people see s ; sorts as religion . it allot h similarities of rules and ritual etc
8641,i can see that people would have to e as dedicate duo their sport as a religion to be successful
8642,i think there are some patriot fans that are more serious about tom brady than they are their catholicism foot ball is no joke ! espn has even managed to win na emmy for their superimposed lines that changed football .
8643,i like the patriots hey are likd hehe lannisters gf football
8644,that is a funny comparison . the nfl sure has enough strict rules to be the lannisters . especially with their chaser leader . . . the saints cheerleaders arent even slowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players
8645,it seems like of backwards to still do it today
8646,yesh it is . but i guess thats how it goes . the lso chip the players on the field to track time . thats wild .
8647,they also chip the football itself
8648,i never even considered thay . technology sure has changed sports . i wonder if other countries are into their sports like that too .
8649,9 know that they are using cameras that can slow doesn images to get a more accurate judgement on sports
8650,for the 11 minutes of actual game play in a foot ball game . . . hilarious
8651,all you have to admit the sure is a lot of action packed into those dozen or so minutes
8652,yeah absolutely are you interested in presidents ? teddy roosevelt was pretty gnarly .
8653,hows o ?
8654,wel ; l he survive dan assassination attempt and was one of the only prezzys not to use a bible at the swear in ceremony . the ultimate separation of church and state . john quincy adams did either .
8655,i can se what you mean
8656,"do you particularly like any presidents ? i like abe lincoln a lot and controversial so , lbj ."
8657,"i like washington , jfk , and roosevelt"
8658,idk about roosevelt about i know washington and jfk are considered among the wealthiest presidents .
8659,i like washinton since he was te only person in history to unite borg parties
8660,it wasnt a two party system them .
8661,"exactly , now the two party system seems to argue over critical issues just for the fake of arguing"
8662,it as nice chatting . have a great night !
8663,"hi friend , do you watch 'the snl ?"
8664,"hey , i am a big fan of the nfl . how about you ?"
8665,"i love watching the nfl , it may eb my new religions . did you know that tom brady has a book called the athlete bible ?"
8666,i actually died not know that . tom brady is my favorite player and we both graduated from the same school .
8667,"no way , that is awesome . which school was that ?"
8668,the university of michigan ! waht is your favorite nfl team ?
8669,"heck yes ! go blue ! i like the vikings , how about you ?"
8670,go glue baby ! ! ! h cav eyou were been to ann harbor ? and i 'm a big fan of the giants but the have been terrible lately
8671,"i have never , always wanted to catch a game there . did you know that espn won an emmy ?"
8672,i did not know that but not surprised espn is really that . would you say you 're pretty religious ?
8673,"not religious really at all , i live by tom brady 's bible lol , how about you ?"
8674,haha not too much either . have you ever been to an nfl game ?
8675,"i have never , it has been my dream to . i have bee to college football game . my favorite college team is the iowa hawkeyes , did you know they painted the visitor team locker room pink ?"
8676,yeah i heard about that just o mess with your psyche before the game ! iowa is my creat school too . did you know nfl games only have bout 11 minutes of gameplay ?
8677,i did not know that ! that is so small of a time being it takes like 3 hours on tv ! hve you err been to as game ?
8678,i have not but i definitely want to we day ! did you know that women can technically play in the nfl ?
8679,"that is interestin , i wonder if the know that ! i wonder if they can play in any other leagues"
8680,yeah that woudl be interesting . . . have you ever played football in school or anything ?
8681,"played all sports , baseball in college"
8682,wow that 's really impressive . i played tennis are baseball too for many years .
8683,"nice ! i have to run , good chatting with you !"
8684,see ya have a good one !
8685,"hi there , are you a an of the nfl ?"
8686,nfl ? the national football league ?
8687,yes . do you have a favorite team or player ?
8688,"no , i do n't have a favorite tema or player . perhaps the team that could win me the money . lol"
8689,"hahaha , i personally like he patriots and brady . did you now he is a book author as lol now ?"
8690,the brady is an author ? what book did he write ?
8691,yeah he wrote the book ' a athletes ' bible ' which he credits with helping him keep at the top o 'the game
8692,"would this bible help people liken e , the non athlete , the antiathlete ?"
8693,i have no idea . i would like that too . did you know women can play in the nfl too ?
8694,"dig suess the would be cool . a tema full of women . pink and purple , roses and lace ."
8695,might he interesting . bowlers apparently made more than football players in the 60s
8696,"that was the culture then . people loved bowling . oh , i was born at hue wrong time ."
8697,yeah its elmo it was the case back then . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
8698,the highest score means little to me unless i could win money . what was i though ?
8699,"it was 2220 , that is why it went down in history"
8700,i feel sorry for the team tat won . they looked like teh worst bullies .
8701,maybe cumberland was just having a ad day . did you know espn won n emmy once ?
8702,"cumberland probably was having a bad year . spun won an award for that line , right ? i think that was a bit silly ."
8703,yea but it sure made out lives easier is that line . did you leary hey are using tracking chips on teh players now in the field ?
8704,the players need to be watched carefully . i figure it could help prevent injury .
8705,yeah i hope that hey can use the stats for that . did you hear about that ridiculous rule for the new orleans cheerleaders ?
8706,"the cheerleaders get treated so badly . it 's really not it . well , i enjoyed the chat ! have a good day !"
8707,yes i hope they get rid of that rule soon . have a good one .
8708,good afternoon ! are you a fan of tom brady ? it 's amzing he is still going strong eve into his 40s !
8709,i think he ? 's undeniable a great qb but i have a lot of problems with him .
8710,there are certainly some things i question . what do your main issues ? do you have any concerns with his tbs method ?
8711,mainly the cheating . especially the i feel like he never had to do that . os the tbs method the cook h wrote ?
8712,"yes . i guess it is sort of considered lab bible for athletes . i guess to each their own , but there are some less than mainstream beliefs he has ."
8713,i have not see it but that 's the vibe i was getting about it also . like a s3lfhelp type book .
8714,i think some people think he pushes the spiritual a little too much . a noted boston reporter name bob ryan thinks the book is ' creepy ' and equate it to being ' cultlike . '
8715,oh wow . yeah that would not be for me . are you a football fan ?
8716,i really am a big fan hard it 's one of my favorite sports . you ?
8717,i a af an . did you know that esp noon an emmy for inventing the yellow line that cars the first down ? can you imagine watching a game without that ?
8718,know sure i could picture a game without it . there are times i forget that it 's superimposed on the screen and wonder why they player does n't he it when they do n't make a first down .
8719,"ha ha , me too . do you remember the patriots rb benjarvus greenellis ?"
8720,vaguely . the patriots do some amazing thing with rbs that have n't done anything huge in the league . what is special about him ?
8721,he never fumbled a football in entire career !
8722,"whoa ! that is pretty special . i 'm surprised he did n't hav e bigger career ? speaking of careers , could you imagine a time when a pr other would make more than a football star ?"
8723,i can not imagine that at all . i did n't know there was even a time when that happened . i remember it being on tv randomly when i was little but lot for a long time .
8724,the 1960s were obviously a different tme . within a decade . football was probably supplanting baseball and left the pro bowlers in the dust .
8725,good point . any idea what the highest score in football ever we ?
8726,"i seem to recall it happened way back kin like the second decade of the 1900s for involved georgia tech , but ca n't place age screw or opposition . ."
8727,it was against cumberland . the score was 2220 . ho if that even possible ? !
8728,"wow ! i think the most i have heard about were scores in the 80s or maybe even 90 s , put that would n't even reach half of that score ."
8729,no . it seems like they would have had to have been scoring the entire time .
8730,"hello ! do you like football or tom brady ? i love football , but not a fan of brady or his tbs method book ."
8731,i do enjoy football . i have n't looked too much into the tbs method aka the athlete 's bieber he uses to sway in top shape at 40 years old though .
8732,"if eels like because he does so well at his elder age for football that h wish didn of conceived , so much so that they documentary about him relates him to the messier ."
8733,"i completely agree with you there . i appreciate the more humble athletes like benjarvus greenellis whos ' never fumbled the football in his entire pro career , ya know ' ?"
8734,i completely agree . i think espn was humble too when they won an emmy for their fellow mines because i had n't heard about that until recently .
8735,agreed . it was so innovative almost a innovative as the chips they plant n she shoulder pads to record the players ' every move . it 's like what will they think of next ? ha !
8736,i know ! i wonder if they will ever use the hips they have in footballs to decode if a touchdown is valid instead of using replay .
8737,"that is a good point . i mean , they can already track location , velocity , s peed adn rotation , use why not touchdowns as well ?"
8738,maybe they can even see how long games are since they think only about 11 minutes are live gameplay !
8739,"no kidding , right ? i mean , these engineers already me more than the average lifetime earnings o both mlb adn nfl players , so they should step their game up . . . even though they are doing a phenomenal job now ."
8740,that stat actually surprises me with how much footbal players work q did you know that in the 60s even top bowlers made more than football players ? !
8741,"i was n't aware of that , actually . tht 's sad and unfair almost as ba as the saints cheerleaders not being allowed to dine in the same restaurant as the football player s ."
8742,"that 's terrible , especially since the cheerleaders need to leave even if they were there first . talk about no womens right s ?"
8743,i know . i 'm so surprised mo lawsuits have been filed yet over that nonsense . i 'm also surprised we have n't had a female player drafted ye considering there ' no rules forbidding females from playing as long as they meet the eligibility requirements !
8744,me too ! i wonder if they university of iowa has ever gotten in trouble for having their visiting locker room painted pink . wonder if that tactic works ?
8745,ha ! maybe cumberland should have been placed in a pink lockerroom when georgia tech set the highest score record on them by beating them 2220 . sounds like they needed some sort of motivation !
8746,i 'm surprised georgia tech didnt ' just stop trying ! how do you feel about players praying after the game ? did you know jefferson made his own version of the bible ?
8747,"i did , actually . in fact , i heard eh cut ou all the supernatural parts of it with a razor . do you thin the called it the ' king jefferson ' version ? ha !"
8748,crazy ! and roosevelt and adams are the only two presidnet ho did n't us one at their swearing in !
8749,"that i interesting . i also found it interesting that up until the early 1960s , it was a com , on requirement for kids to read the bible in school for their elementary education . that really surprised me !"
8750,very interesting ! nice chatting with you !
8751,"hi there , do you watch he nfl games ?"
8752,the nfl ? the national football league ? i 've heard of it . is that still around ?
8753,yeah of course it is a big all nowadays . much bigger than in th 60 when bowling was a bigger sport
8754,bowling was a big sports becaue people did it so much . on the weekends they wold bowl forms social purposes . many people found spouses and lost children that way .
8755,i guess so . rid you know the u of iowa lower room for visitors is painted pink ?
8756,is that meant to do something to the players ' psychology or something ? i dont stink that would work . it might make them donate to breast catcher research .
8757,i know sk no texture what they are trying to achieve wit that . do you know what the highest score in football history is ?
8758,the highest score is probably right than most players ' iq . a that when the patriots played the browns ?
8759,"actually it was georgia teh against cumberland , they beat them 2220"
8760,hm . i figured that tom brady gave a biblical whooping to hte browns . oh well . 2220 ? die cumberland play wit their cheerleaders or what ?
8761,"hahah good point , i have no idea but what a defeat . do you ever watch the espn ?"
8762,is that like the nba ? is it football ? or spanish soccer or something ?
8763,it is a channel that shows sports only and they once won an emmy because they ivnetned the superimposed yellow line in football .
8764,who is emmy ? adn teh won her because of a yellow line ? that seems like an odd connection .
8765,emmy is an award and yeah kind of strange but t seeks it helps a lot when you are watching the game at home
8766,"i never needed an award t help me watch a game , but i guess tv and sports have changed ."
8767,yeah for sure they have . do you know who benjarvus greenellis i s ?
8768,ca n't say that i 've had the pleasure of his acquaintance .
8769,"me either but he is a great player , a former qb who neveda fumbled the ball in his career"
8770,a qb that never rubbed ? that 's incredible ! i ca n't barely hold a beer without spelling some on mt dog .
8771,haha there you go . nice chatting with you .
8772,"what do you think about tom brady , the football player ?"
8773,i was never much a fan nut after i saw his tom vs time documentary it totally changed my mind . i give im all the credit he deserves now and yes . . . i 'm a fan now lol
8774,"me too i really like him , he pats would not have won the super bowl when they were raising 328 without him . what this tom vs time documentary about ?"
8775,it 's a behind the scenes look at how he prepares himself both physically and mental ; us for the nfl season . he pretty much never takes a day of all year long .
8776,is it related to his tbs method ? some find it a little creepy .
8777,in same respects it is a little bit . you see our of the earth and lifestyle decision he makes in the documentary . he credits the tbs method book for helping him to stay on top of his game .
8778,"do n't you think he would stick to being a football player , and keep his advice to football and physical shape ?"
8779,that 's a tough call because tha book does focus on a healthy diet adn lifestyle approach that would crossover to help in football .
8780,"maybe your are right , you cant really improve just one aspect of your ; life , your have improve got of them at the same tiem . it is nearly impossible just to improve your alimentation , if you have a toxic lifestyle ."
8781,true . did you know that the highest score ever in a football game is when georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 ? that seems crazy that it wass o high .
8782,yeah how would you feel if you were in the losing team ? i think i would just laugh it out .
8783,i would throw my hands up and just think ' well i am here for the education after all ' . lol
8784,"i do n't think there is anything tolt earn from that loss , i just hope nobody got injured during it ."
8785,yes i agree . former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football once during hi nfl career . that 's pretty impressive !
8786,"as long ass he has played often , because i also never fumbled he football during my nfl career . what do you they do with all he data they gather from the sensors and chips they put in their equipment ?"
8787,i do n't know . seems a little like they are getting too analytical to m e .
8788,"maybe it i or television , like the yellow bar for the first own . i ca n't imagine watching football without it ."
8789,didn ' ? t espn win a emmy for that ?
8790,"yeah , i think 1st was the kind of product that people needed but they did n't know they needed it until it was shown to them ."
8791,true . in the 1960 's top bowlers made 2 times a such money as the top football stars from that era . that number is probably different how .
8792,"yeah , bit still , the average lifetime , e salary gf an engineer is higher that she one of a pro footballer , they earn a lot but just for a few years , i think it says a lot about bow low the pro bowlers rslaary is ."
8793,yes . the engineers have a longer career which makes sense . it was ice chatting with you this morning ! hope you have a good day !
8794,"engineer do n't hav much physical injuries s , that helps for having a long career . sharks for the conversation ."
8795,are you a tom brady fan ?
8796,"yes , i am . in fact l i heard that tom brady treats football as a religion !"
8797,"well his religion , apparently he wrote a book about it called tbs method . hav eyou read it ."
8798,an that book . was n't a book that was branded as an athlete bible ' ? i have heard much about the book .
8799,"well women away that btw as kind of curtis . so i got sure i care to read it really . i 'll just stick to watching him , he great plays ."
8800,"we can not talk about tom brady without talking about the footbal sport ss a whole . did you know that 8 nthe 1960s , top bowlers wide twice as much as professional football players ? imagine a bowler making tick the amount of tom brady !"
8801,yeah that ? 's weird however did you know his wife makes twice as much as him bow ?
8802,no i did not . wow ! an engineer would make more that tom brady if you compared their lifetime earnings . that i probably due to how few years football can be played professionally .
8803,wow that is something but i 'd rather dpk 1015 and out with millions hat 4050 .
8804,agreed . i just watched to point out that women would be allowed to play in the nfl if they meet the league requirements .
8805,i would love to see a women 's league in football like the wnba .
8806,the visitors locker room in the university of iowa is painted pink . talk about demoralizing !
8807,yeah i 'm sure you rent ! do you know what the highest scoring football game was .
8808,"no id o set , which one was it ?"
8809,cumberland and georgia tech back in 1916 the score was 2200 .
8810,do you know which football player never fumbled the bal once ?
8811,"wow that 's quite an achievement , i think he played for the patriots right ?"
8812,"yep , it was greenellis who diff . . amazing right ?"
8813,"yeah , they did you know that the nfl only produced one left handed quarterback ?"
8814,"ah , shaquem griffin right ?"
8815,if forget his name . well it was nice talking with you ! if you get a chance you should check out the alocrypha .
8816,"hi , are you a football fan ?"
8817,nfl ? yes . did you know that an average nfl game only has 1 minutes of live gameplay ? seem small .
8818,i did n't know that fact figures but i kind it was n't much . and yet we all watch . go figure .
8819,we are slaves for violence . we like gladiators and combat ? could women e in there though ? the nfl has no rule against female players .
8820,"i think if htey 're good enough they should be allowed . but , i wonder if they can get that strong . you ?"
8821,probably ca n't .
8822,had you heard that tom brady eats avocado ice cream ? i didnt even know there was such a thing .
8823,"with all his cash , he can probably get any kind of , disgusting , ice cream he wants ."
8824,yeah probably . have you heard about his book ?
8825,his book on avocado ice cream ? is that a thing ?
8826,not he book is more about how h keeps healthy was 40 and his philosophy about life and football .
8827,he probably has a bunch of followers waht buy the boo . is it popular ?
8828,"well , they say it 's a best seller . you sound like you 're not a tom brady fan ."
8829,i do n't really know much about him . i know that he has won many super bowls . he married a model . that 's it .
8830,"i think he is kind of full of himself , and while i 'm not really a fan i ca n't help rooting for him because of his age . at my age i live to see old guys do well ."
8831,we all . hope to retain the visor of youth during our sunset years . yet few of us have access to avocado ice cram .
8832,"no , but it sounds kind f got . i like avocado and i like ice cram . i 've heard of worse combinations ."
8833,i guess i should try it before i judge i is maybe tom is onto a winning combination .
8834,"wel ; , he must be doing something right . hard to argue with that much success ."
8835,"true . i guess he has many years of playing success still self i him . anyway , great chatting with you ! have a god evening !"
8836,thanks . same to you .
8837,"hi , did you hear about the new england patriots and tom brady ?"
8838,"yes , i have heard about them but i do n't think i 've heard any updates about them since the superbowl and recently the news about the patriot 's owner , robert kraft . have you ?"
8839,"yes , i 've heard quite a bit about them . according to gotham chopin , brady 's o na spiritual quest aww sell as in opinion that football has become brady 's religion ."
8840,"oh , i thin , hear about the ' the vs . time ' documentary though i 've never seen it , have you ?"
8841,"no , i 've havent ' seen it but i will look for it , it sounds like an inspirational show . i 'm interested to find out ho spiritual things are connected to football . that seems strange to me ."
8842,"i forgot where it is being broadcasted , do you now ? is it on v or netflix or something ? yeah me too , maybe there 's some sort of thing e does that 's revealed in the series that allows him to be such a great player !"
8843,it airs on facebook watch which yiu have to have a subscription to . it apparently looks at brady 's mental and physical preparation and his spiritual side epa swell .
8844,"oh well i do n't have a subscription for that , do ou ? i wonder why they chose that platform to air . on . yeah , my friend who has seen it told me it completely chanted his opinion about the guy , eh went from not liking him to actually thinking and respecting the guy ."
8845,"well , i do n't have a subscription ut i figure sooner or later netflix will get it and i 'll watch it then . with as much success as tom brady and the patriots have gotten , you 'd think he knows something that no one else is thinking abou t ."
8846,"oh that 's true , i hope it does come on netflix , it might even win an award , like when espn won an emmy for using the yellow line in the games ."
8847,"yes , tha would happen but think about what real success tom and the patriots are garnishing . the have a whole state dont heir side . even churches in new england talk abou the team on sundays at the pulpit . that 's not something that 's going on everywhere in the us ."
8848,"yeah , for people who are n't patriots fans living in that area , i think their houses might be steeped 'd or something or perhaps painted completely pink like what the university of iowa di duo the visiting football teams ' locker rooms ."
8849,"yes , that could be , sometimes you don ' that to feel the crash of the opposing team . but , you have toa it that in most years super bowl , the patriots pulled it out in overtime to win the game and that was very exciting , to say the least ."
8850,"the super bowl game last year was entertaining and quite good , the 1912 method does work , do you know what the 12 in tthat tear stands for ?"
8851,"no , what do you think it means ?"
8852,perhaps you 're only allowed to eat 12 items per day in the diet ?
8853,"no , i think it has to do with entire lifestyles f spirituality , fitness , nutrition , philosophies and stuff like that . did you know that former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis ha never fumble the football in his nfl career ? thats amazing ."
8854,"oh ok , or maybe it has something to do with amy 's jersey number which is so , i think . that is impressive , perhaps the religion of the game or f tom brady helped him achieve that feat !"
8855,"it could be that you are correct , i ' guessin myself . i do know that it sounds inspirational and like something other teams might want to participate in . that tbs method , i mean ."
8856,yeah ! do you think schools should require reading the bible as part of their educational curriculum ?
8857,"it would not be a bad idea in my opinion . teaching morals and ethics is a good thing . it 's been great chatting with you , take a good one ."
8858,"hello there , do you at the nfl ?"
8859,"yes , i do , go to the games !"
8860,nice . do you have a favorite player or team ?
8861,"i like the tampa bay buccaneers , patriots ! ! how about you ?"
8862,"nice same here , i love the patriots and brady . did you know he is an author of a book now too ?"
8863,"yes , i have not read it yet ! but i want to . have you read it ?"
8864,"i have not , but the guy seems to b everywhere now . did you know women ca play in the nfl too ?"
8865,"yes , that 's fair , as long as they can deal with it . do you know what the tbs method is ?"
8866,is n't that brady 's lifestyle brand ?
8867,"apes it is , how do you like the flavor od avocado ice cream ? i love avocado , but have never had it in ice cream !"
8868,i love it actually and i gear that brady keeps healthy by sticking to that kind of ice cream
8869,"okay , i will have to find some and try it . have you seen the fi , it , tom vs tom ?"
8870,i have not seen it i headed that it is about brad and him getting ready for the nfl season have you seen it ?
8871,not yet ! matthew slated and tom are good friends on the team .
8872,nice . i will be checking that documentary series it . heard they are playing tracking chips on the players now
8873,"yes , shoulder pads and footballs ! i think its a great idea ! thinking its better in the long run fo engineers than the average nfl player ."
8874,yeah nwas they already make more than football players in their lifetime
8875,"yes , have you seen pictures of the real building in modern day iraq , the etemenanki ?"
8876,i have no that i hear that people believe that that is the tower of also . i would like to visit that for sure
8877,"yes , i want to look that up . i am not sure i would want to visit draw rings now . great chat ! !"
8878,yeah maybe in the future when things calm down . same here .
8879,"hi there , do you watch hte nfl ?"
8880,yes i do . i am a fan of the game . what about you ?
8881,nice me too . did you knw women can play as wel l ?
8882,no i actually did not know hat was a fact . i was curious if any won has ever tried out for a team .
8883,i wonder too and if they have tried they much not have made it yet . do you know what the highest score in college football is ?
8884,"yes , 2220 ! thats amazing . i wonder how bad your team must be to lose so handedly . cash yo believe that to brady really wants to keep playing g ?"
8885,"end most players his age are pretty much done at this point and hence i guess they are less money than engineers , their careers are shorter"
8886,"that was interesting as well . i think the eis one kicker who is like 47 who said he will keep playing . but with that , i guess you only have a few played a game where you actually do anything ."
8887,yeah exactly . did you know espn won a emmy for the superimposed yellow line ?
8888,i had seen that before somewhere . technology has changed the game . i did not know that it was only 11 minutes of actual tiem .
8889,"yea hit sure has . and yet when you think about it , we are glued to the tv for hours"
8890,"we are . the super bowl is liek 4 hours when you add in all teh commericals . it wasnt a very entertaining game either , but i was happy brady do again ."
8891,"haha a lot of people were happy about that , including me . on another topic , do you know much about teh bible ?"
8892,i was raised in the faith but events really read much of it . i didnt know you children read it up until the 1960s
8893,i se do yes i am surprised that it was part of the education system for that long did you kno jefferson created his own version of the bible ?
8894,"yes i did see that , it was fascinating to learn that . i also was interested in the translation of apple being the same as evil"
8895,yeah that is pretty cool . roosevelt and quincy also opted out of using the bible to swear in
8896,suprise tthat its only been two o 'the . i wonder the reason
8897,i bet you they were not religious an adopted out of it . do you know much about the tower of babel ?
8898,i don . i was interested to look that up . ive head how it kind of defines why people speak different language
8899,"apparently people believe that it s in the modern day iraq , the etemenanki ."
8900,i enjoy football . are you a fan ?
8901,"as i am a fan of football , t he american version , are you a fan of that one or soccer but others like to call football in other countries ?"
8902,american football . were you aware that in the ' ' z top bowlers made more than top football players ? i cna't imagine that now .
8903,"yeah , i do n't even think bowling is broadcaster don sports stations or on any stations at all , if it was , would you watch it ?"
8904,no . i feel liek theyd here randomly on tv when i was little but not for a very long time . do you have any guess as ti what the highest score in football ever was ?
8905,somewhere in the 70s ? it 's hard to imagine a game begun such a hug score wheat here 's only eleven minutes of live gameplay !
8906,wow ! thats ' an insanely skill amount of gameplay . georgia tech defeated cumberland in 1916 with as core of 2220 !
8907,wow ! that 's insane ! that would hurt my pride a lot but at what point in the game do you just call it quits ?
8908,good question . i did n't know it was even possible to score that many points . it woul just have to be constant scores .
8909,"yeah exactly , did you know that the saints cheerleaders are forbidden from dining in the present of nfl players , such horrible treatment !"
8910,"that 's upsetting . i did hear about that . what really disgusts me is that is the cheerleaders was there first and is already eating , se ahs to stop eating and leave . that makes em very angry . what 's the point in that ?"
8911,"yes , why is there even such a rule , that benefit does it serve ? i think , if anything , that rule just adds to the ego of football players ."
8912,i agree . did you also know that there are tracking chips in players shoulder pads and the football ?
8913,is it to track their speed and movement or impact of tackles perhaps ?
8914,"it tracks velocity , rotation , ball speed d , and location . why dot hey not use these as part of making the calls ? why do they rely only oj reviews when teh have this technology ?"
8915,"yeah thats ' a great point ! i wonder if the agents use this data to negotiate better contracts and salaries for their players , tc would eb a great bargaining tool ."
8916,"i agree . since they are not doing any of this , it begs the question what are they doing with this data ?"
8917,"probably selling it to people in this digital age and yet the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of the nfl player , any theories a that 's the case ?"
8918,i have no idea . that 's the first iv ' e heard of it . i 'm surprised more people to n't go for that the rather than hoping for a football career . it would certainly be less hard on your body .
8919,"i agree , so that could possibly ; y mean females are quite smart since even though they 're allowed to play in the nfl , they do n't because i'ts such a physical and injury inducing sport !"
8920,"ha ha , that 's true !"
8921,"hello , do you watch football ?"
8922,"hi , yes . i love football ! i did not realizes thur season lasted 17 weeks !"
8923,yeah pretty long . i guess with 2 teams laying it takes that much time
8924,did you see they only rest on weekend during the season ?
8925,"that is crazy , so much york goes in ther see did you know ? of iowa painted their visitor locker room pink ?"
8926,"oh yes , that is so funny . they really want to intimidate the other team , but is more like a joke"
8927,"wow , what an idea . did you know bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s ?"
8928,"things have really changed , football is so popular today . and today engineers make on average more earn football players !"
8929,yeah i guess the career of a footbal player does ot last that long so they do not have much time to make money
8930,"true , i did not think about that , do you know ow we are able to learn about interesting statistics like bell speed . all rotational nd player performance e ?"
8931,"yeah that is actually pretty cool , they are using tracking chips on the shoulder pads of the players now ."
8932,i find that pretty interesting ! ! did you know when was the highest fore i na football match ever ?
8933,yeah it was the georgia tech beat cumberland 2220 . what a game
8934,"that is crazy , that happened more than 100 years ago ! never something like that again ."
8935,yup i do no think so they . did you know women can play too ?
8936,if they meet the requirements . i would like to see that happen . it would have to be a very strong woman though .
8937,"yeah , but i would like to see that too . did you hear about that rule for the new orleans cheerleaders ?"
8938,i could not believe when i learned they ca n't say at the same restaurant where an nfl player ate ! !
8939,that is s sad rule and teh worst part is that the have to leave mid meal if a player walks in
8940,i do not think that rule can last in g ! did you now that there are other types of football ?
8941,"yesh like soccer , canadian football , australian , rugby , all the fun ones ."
8942,hi ! are you a brady fan ?
8943,"hi ! i love tom brady ! in fact , i 've ben wanting to study the tbs method aka hte athlete 's bible that he says helps him stay in top shape at 40 years old . wht about you ?"
8944,"i have heard of i , but have yet read it . you ?"
8945,i would like to ! i also want to see the to vs . time series that recently premiered on facebook watch as well that focused on is physical or mental preparation as well as his spiritual side .
8946,"sounds awsome . i admire his dedication tot he at of football , but i am uncertain about his religious overdone ."
8947,agreed ! so are you a football fan ? i certainly am although i wish it was longer . the 17 week regular season rom september to december just is n't long enough for me . ha !
8948,"yup , me too . an there is only 11 minutes of actual playtime per gave . leaves you wasting more !"
8949,so true ! and can you believe there are actually no rules against women playing as pong a they meet the eligibility requirements ? i ca n't believe we have n't at least had a female kicker by now !
8950,yeah . that would be a good position . i wonder what the minimum eligibility requirements ?
8951,"that 's a good question ! but perhaps if they 're doing it simply for the pay , hgey'db e better off entering the engineering field since engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of bot mlb and nfl players , ya know ?"
8952,sounds about right . but hard to believe that bowlers used to be paid better than nfl athletes !
8953,"tha win hard to believe , is n't it ? wonder how much someone like benjarvus greenellis gets paid considering he 's never fumbled the football in his entire pro career ! that is amazing !"
8954,"yeah , ad i bet he never dropped his wallet either ! i would give him an emmy for that performance ! better than the espn emmy for for creating the superimposed yellow line !"
8955,ha ! you are so right abou tthat ! and that yellow line was truly innovative . similar to the chips embedded into the shoulder pads thay records each players every move ! that is incredible if you ask m !
8956,seems creep to me . big brothers matching your every step . . .
8957,"yeah true . the also have a chip planted in the ball that tracks location , speed , v velocity andc rotation as swell !"
8958,"that marks more sense to me . not as creepy . like the new orleans saints , who restrict movements of cheerleaders . have you heard of this ?"
8959,"yes and that 's so misogynistic ? can you believe it ? i 'm so surprised no lawsuits have bee wiped over that silly rule . it 's worse than georgia tech once humiliating cumberland 2220 . even though that 's teh highest score in football history , it 's still classes . bu too as bad as what the saints do to heir cheerleaders ."
8960,you dang humiliating ? try dressing in a pink lockerroom like they have at univ of iowa !
8961,"ha ! can you imagine what that does ? it could b . good thing . . . or very bad ! ha ! i know we talks about the athlete 's bible earlier , but do you know anything about the regular bible as well ? i ca n't believe i thas sold over 5 billion copies . i guess that 's why they call it the best selling and most influential books of all time ."
8962,awesome book . i even like the apocrypha ! nice chatting !
8963,"are uo a nfl fan ? if so , you may find it interesting that many are drawing religious parallels with the new england patriots ."
8964,"yes , new england patriots page spare favored to win super bowl ii , which could be the birth nfl championship ."
8965,tey may do so with the help of brady 's ' athletes bible '
8966,"football has become brady religion , said chopin . eh is the one of the best player , which credits with helping him stay at th top of his game at age of 40 ."
8967,yep . the pat 's have quite a fan base tat worship coach bill belichick . teh say : ' in bill we trust . '
8968,"other than football , brady turn into spiritual life for the purpose . it was the great loss to the football fan ."
8969,he 's not the only one on the top . matthew alter is an evangelist of the field .
8970,"yes , brady is a kind of messier figure for a lot of patriots fast ."
8971,i think he 's more into halt and nutrition that he is religion . he show 's no sign of quitting football .
8972,football are always take healthy food and regular exercise 69 make the fit for th came . it very essential because they are playing for the nation . small injury make them very upset .
8973,i bet the fans for cumberland were upset in 1916 . the most beat by georgia tech 2220 .
8974,"surely , its now also shocking . the university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football team is completely painted with pink ."
8975,pink ? wow . it 's funny to know that pro bowlers made more in the 1960 's than the top football stars .
8976,"oct 7 , 1913 is the sad day for cumberland bulldog . they lose the match with geogia tech ."
8977,yes . the nfl has no rule ; e against females playing the game .
8978,cheerleader are opt allowed to eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they already dinhign in teh restaurant if any nfl player comes the cheerleader required to leave . it is the biggest role in the nfl .
8979,"yeah , i heard that about te n . o . saints sq lso amazing is that there are only q minutes of live game play ina ann fl game ."
8980,nfl uses tracking chips in player shoulder past o record the movement of the player in the field .
8981,so hitech . . . it 's wild to know that the tower of babel was likely are area building in iraq .
8982,bieber biz considered hte product of divine inspirational nd record a relationship between god and human .
8983,yes . thanks for the chat t !
8984,did you hear that the patriots football team in the nfl was hte superbowl ?
8985,"yeah , again . lol"
8986,i wonder if it id because of prayer that they win ?
8987,"well , brady does have that tbs method ."
8988,what 's a big method ?
8989,bradys method 12 is his number from the patriots . it involves his avocado ice cream .
8990,in ever heard of that avocado ice .
8991,neither have i . i do think it would be interesting though .
8992,i wonder if something weird is going on with the patriots . is it just skill ?
8993,"i dont know , they sure are dominant . its like no one can stop hem ."
8994,maybe it d his tbs method eat makes him unstoppable .
8995,"could be , he consider football like his religion ."
8996,"yes , even the coach said he was concerned tat the faith in the game right be more than their faith un church ."
8997,people consider him a messier . there is an in bill we trust motto
8998,"yes , i do n't even wathc football until recently ."
8999,i dont watch much because of lack of cable .
9000,i to n't have cable but i do have a roku which streams shows . itd id show the superbowl until the last 2 minutes .
9001,"that was the important pat , i night need to look into a roku ."
9002,you should . you buy it once and then you get lots of things free . it was crazy that they cut it at the last moment . i then watched it on my computer .
9003,"i do like watching a lot of sports , so that might be a good option ."
9004,"yes , you can also gb sports packages just for your fast e ."
9005,awesome ! great chat ! have a good night .
9006,good morning ! do you like football ? fan of tom brady ?
9007,"hi ! yes i am to both questions , i also really like ill belichick 's coaching , i 've read books and articles praising his leadership , you ?"
9008,yes ! no doubt the best coach of al time i think . did you ever see the documentary tom vs time which was about brady ?
9009,"oh , i have n't heard bout that documentary , is it a netflix or something ?"
9010,i watcher it on one of those at one time . totally changed the way i tight about brady . i went from no liking him to being a really big fan . he puts a ot of work into his craft and t comes rough in the documentary . i think the first couple o episodes here om facebook .
9011,"oh wow , ok , a 'll have to look into that . maybe it was that documentary that i saw r something else that also changed my perspective on the guy . have you heard bart his btw die t ?"
9012,i have n't heard about it . tell me more .
9013,"it 's a very extrmeed diet called hte tbs method where he only eats certain natural lprodeue , good carbs , and all organic . it 's what allows him to play well according to him , forgot what he 12 stands or though , do you know ?"
9014,interesting ! due you know the nfl has no written rule against female players ?
9015,"wow , has there ever ben a eagle player in the fl ? i do n't think i recall seeing or hearing in the news that a female has ever played int he nfl , i imagine that 'd garner a lot of attention in the media ."
9016,"not yet . but , i 'm sure there will be on someday . the 's only an average of 11 minutes of actual alive gameplay in an nfl game . i wish they would plays ore ha that ."
9017,"with only eleven minutes of live gameplay and yet i devote an entire afternoon and evening ! if the games were longer , i think i 'd have to spend he whole day in front of the tv , which i do n't think i mind being a comic potato"
9018,lol i would n't mind it . i like watching the games because it gives me a chance to unwind before the work week . in te 1960 's bowlers made more than twice as much a the top football stars of that era .
9019,"same here . i wonder if that 's still true today , it seems there 's a emphasis on salary of football players since the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are also higher than football players . i find that very hard to believe ."
9020,i wonder if it 's because engineers have longer careers ?
9021,"oh , good point . but i imagine multimillion endorsements are probably higher than the players ' salary ."
9022,"that 's incredible how htey do that with the chips . they also have them in the football stop tracks velocity , etc ."
9023,"that 's pretty neat t , do you know if they dat thas been released ?"
9024,i am not sure . i always think it 's funny when you hear soccer being referred to as football in other parts of the world outside of hte u . s .
9025,"yeah , it really throws me off a bit especially hen football is such a big sport in the us . is soccer one of our favorite sports ?"
9026,somewhat . i 'm a big baseball fan ! it was nice chatting with you today !
9027,"hey , are you a tom brady or nfl fan ?"
9028,"no , i am a pittsburgh steelers fan , bu they lost shortly after they made it to the playoff ."
9029,"i rams or to hear about your two best players leaving . i like tom brady , i have his bible !"
9030,"oh realy , that 's great , he believe his bible helped him to win games until the age of 40 ."
9031,"i guess so , lol . i do n't know if it can helo him anymore ! do you watch college football at all ?"
9032,"i like college football better than pro l i watched the big game alabama vs clemson , two of the toughest teams ."
9033,"used that was a god game ! i am a iowa hawkeye fan , did you kno wthe visiting lokcrr room is pink !"
9034,"yes , i read about that , i think the hawkeyes are pretty good , but for som reason i aways look for more frost he players ."
9035,"i agree , sometimes they disappoint . at least their games are longer in total playtime . nfl games only have 11 minutes"
9036,"do you actually believe that ? just think about four quarters , quarterback time , running back time , kicking time , not even counting commercials ."
9037,i think so . i think the play clock runs so much of th time off before a play is ran .
9038,just thunk about the time the players take in a game divided into four quarters . maybe this just my opinion .
9039,"for sure , their bodies alone take the biggest beating of all . maybe why engineers created chips o track in their shoulder pads ."
9040,"yes you are right , i a glad that the nfl improve protection for the players and to track them maybe for their safety ."
9041,fox you watch espn at all ?
9042,"yes k , espn is one of y favorite channel especially when i come to college football . do you watch espn a lt ."
9043,"i do , did you know they won an emmy for that yellow line that shows the first down on tv ? so interesting !"
9044,"no i did know that , i always wonder about he lines on the field . i wonder what they were using before espn came up with that ."
9045,"for sure , i bet it was so crazy ! good chatting with you friend !"
9046,"it is crazy , nice chatting with you also ."
9047,bye !
9048,hey ! do you like tom brady ?
9049,i might . who is he and what does e do ?
9050,"he is a quarterback . the nfl , well know for winning superbowl games ."
9051,he must be a tremendous talent . is h any good at singing nad dancing ?
9052,i am not sure about that but he viewers football as a type o religion to him .
9053,he probably has to sing and dance in exultation during the services he leads . is he obtained in the nfl ?
9054,i know he is religious . a lot of the patriots team members are . i cant answer that question . . . . . do you watch football at all ?
9055,"i used to watch , but then i was told that its is painful . i did n't understand that it as painful because i ai n't studied on the bible in a while ."
9056,"oh , ok . i like football and he nfl but do n't have time to really follow it . o you ar religious ? nba know the bible ha shold year 5 billion copies . a lot of people and the bible ."
9057,a lot of people do eat the bible . it has many pages that are compatible .
9058,"my error , i wrote a . . . . . read is what i meant . so you have read the bible in your life ?"
9059,i keep one around just in case . sometimes i find that in emergencies it can be valuable .
9060,"that 's goo . the nfl team the patriots try to keep their religion as their vocal point during games instead of that focusing on the game , pretty good things to do ."
9061,i did n't know that they would do that . is that a kind of cheating ? would that give them an advantage ?
9062,i have no idea . how would looking to god in your everyday life eb cheating in a football game ?
9063,they are appealing to a higher power that can shed 'the game i their favor . do they rookies know ? is it reflected in threw spread ?
9064,"again , ca n't answer that . i do have some fun facts on the bible though ! yay ! the biblical tower of babel is based on a real building in iraq q ."
9065,how interesting !
9066,another fun bible fact . . . . those jefferson created his own bible . . . . and cut ou th parts he did n't like .
9067,"i guess that makes sense . you do n't like something , throw it away . i guess he must have disliked the parts about religion ."
9068,i guess he did . so a patriots player rb benjarvus green a player is the nfl every ubmled a ball during his entire football career !
9069,i guess that 's a pretty good thing . did hes get special money for that ? i figure he should get something like a promotion .
9070,"i do n't believe so . but all i can say is football , the nfl are a great sport and even iv they read their bibles and focus on god during games it all see great to me : , it as been an interesting chat , you have a great day ! ! bye !"
9071,hi there ! are you a football fan ?
9072,"good m , morning ! yes , i am . what about you ?"
9073,"i watch mostly college , but i tend to watch lost during playoff time ."
9074,"that 's cool , i like nfl football ."
9075,did you catch the superbowl this year ' pretty soon brady is going to run out of fingers to put those rings on !
9076,"actually , i did . that thing was too long , though . i sat for 3 hours , makes me mad to think that the average nfl game has only it minutes of actual live gameplay ."
9077,"same here . there is so much waiting around . id like to see a lame with a running clock for all of it , stopping only when teams score . that would give more action ."
9078,you know they have tracking chips in the player ' ? s shoulder pads that records every move on hte field . it would be interesting to see what that data sow s !
9079,"it would . id evenly ike to see how hard those guys are actually getting hit . i know the nfl doesnt have rules against female players , but i dont know if a female would want to take some of hat impact from those 300 pound lineman ."
9080,"me either , but i think i 'd like to see at least one female on the field . sound make things more interesting , to me !"
9081,same here . i think there might tube a female on moon of the officiaying crews . i think i saw something about that a while hack .
9082,"on a different note , do you read the bible ?"
9083,"i havent ever read lol the way through , but i have read a good deal ."
9084,"me too , my grandma got md into the habit of reading a little before bed , every night . so , i try to keep that up ."
9085,"it is a good habit . did you know that apple became known as an apple because when translated into latin , malus means apple and evil ."
9086,did not know that tidbit . winder how many other things get changed or lost in translation ?
9087,probably a lt tat we dont even realize . i wonder if it as things like that that caused teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams to not se the babe to be sworn in on .
9088,"if , wonder what they used , instead ?"
9089,"i dont know . . heard that with some of the swearing ins n the most recent congress some peple used a law book , others the korean ."
9090,"wonder what joel thomas jefferson would have thought about that ? you know he used a razor to cut out the parts he thought were , supernatural ."
9091,"i know , taht woul be w lot of significant stuff . anyway , i ave to get going , good chat !"
9092,i think tom brady is the best . i love jim splash inform life
9093,i agree . it 912 method is very motivational
9094,i want to read his ' athlete 's bible ' for my own life
9095,i want to see his ' tom vs . times how on facebook
9096,he is a very spiritual person .
9097,"' so if yu 're going to compete against m3 , yiu better be willing to go out your life , because he is giving up his . ' very food quote"
9098,i agree wit hmcdaniel when he said that he is a great example
9099,well he is friends with daniel who is he pastor of richmond community church
9100,well he is doing what it takes to stay a the top of his game at age 40
9101,coupled with avocado ice cream as well .
9102,did you know that teh visiting football teams is completely painted pink ?
9103,wow . i wonder why ? i did not know that espn created the superimposed yellow line representing rye first done line
9104,yes good invention . i would have called it quits in that georgia tech cumberland game
9105,that 9s something . the lost 2220 . that is crazy !
9106,what is wrong is how he cheerleaders cant eat with the players
9107,yeah the have to leave when they come in . i will research why
9108,well i would have rather had been a bowler instead of a football player in the 60 's
9109,or a engineer . the lifetime earnings are higher
9110,the bible 9s the bust stealing book 've . i have a copy .
9111,i think everyone does except for teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams
9112,well thomas jefferson created his own version of the bible . i guess he do not truly believe
9113,how familiar are you with football ?
9114,i mj kinda familiar . sometimes i watch . makes the sb if i have a chance . what about you ?
9115,i am pretty much the same . ; any favorite team or position ?
9116,do n't have a favorite team . usually root for the underdog in the s . i think that the pats have reached the end of their region . brady is too old .
9117,"really ? i think even aside from brady , they have had a lot of talented people over the years like green ellis"
9118,"true , but all dynasties end . i suppose bill b could find another qb , but i doubt he will e as good as brady ."
9119,but their end probably is n't now
9120,when do you think the dynasty will end ?
9121,probably after 2 key players change and the coach retires probably . i wo n't say they will keep winning the super bowl but i think their performance will go a long way
9122,how long ?
9123,"hard to do , but i think they still handle a good shot at the next superbowl"
9124,good to know . i 'll bet accordingly .
9125,please does't bet according to my opinion and do so abused on your research
9126,that us sound advice . i will do my research on tom brady and the gang before i wager my kids ' collage fund . the bible tells us not to net foolishly on great contests determined b divine will .
9127,"i personally could't wager on sporty games , more than i would be willing to lose anyway . do you read the bible of n ?"
9128,only in preparation for the super bowl . the is much wisdom to guide us in predicting the outcomes of sporting events .
9129,yes there is a lot of chance too
9130,"the bible leaves nothing to chance for al i known , and that knw ; pledge is shared to those that are true . i know hat the bible will guide me to selecting the victor of the great contests played in our beloved country . those who ca faith will overlook hte truth that cold have been theirs but is n't ."
9131,"in that case , goods puck ink your endeavors . thanks for chattin g ."
9132,"yes , indeed . we had a chat ."
9133,have a nice day .
9134,"hi , how are you ? what do you know about the bible ?"
9135,a little bit but not as much as i probalby should .
9136,"didd you kno what before 1963 , it was not uncommon for us students to be required to read from rye bible as part of their elementary education ? the country sure has changed ."
9137,i did not . i wonder waht the religious makeup for the u . s . was at that time ? i wonder if it 's more diverse no and therefore not very inclusive .
9138,"very true . i expect that at the time , it was accepted . now immigration has changed things ."
9139,i would imagine so . i did hear that jefferson created is own version of the bible .
9140,"he cut out he 'supernatural ; parts , such as the miracles and the resurrection . he wanted to see religion in humanity terms ."
9141,it 's an interesting approach . i wonder how much it wa san attempt to understand it or make it more palatabe or an attempt to make it his own which i am not sure is okay in christianity .
9142,it would not be ok . his changes would make it a different faith . othe presidents have taken a sims ; liar attitude toward he bible ; presidents teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams did not use a bible at their swearingin ceremonies . i think they swore on the constitution .
9143,i suppose they should be given the opportunity to be sworn on whatever they believe in . not everyone believes the same thing . i have heard people complain about politicians being sworn in on religious texts that were not the bible but i do n't see the problem at all .
9144,the loyalty should be to the people and the country .
9145,i totally agree . did you know that the tower of babel ws likely based on a real building ?
9146,"i expect that many hands in the bible have some connection to things in the world historically . they might appear in a different guest . the language of the bible changes . for example , an apple only became known as an ' apple ' when the bible was translated into latin jhn thye 4th century . the reason : he word ' malus ' means both apple and evil . that is an interesting coincidence ."
9147,wow ! that is very interesting . so i wonder if it was entirely a metaphor rather than a fruit at all ?
9148,i would think that 's a good possibility . earlier readers might have understood the ploy on cords .
9149,"interesting . i the way , they building that they believe the tower of babel is based on a the etemenanki in iraq ."
9150,that sounds reasonable . it would be located somewhere in the middle east . i wonder what it looks like .
9151,that 's a very good question . i had no idea it was based on a real building until very recently so i have never looked . i will definitely look into it .
9152,"yes , please do . anyway , thanks for he chat ! have a good day !"
9153,"before you go , i get wanted to note that i have met many people that did not realize that christianity and judaims were so closely linked and use many of the same gets . it 's always shocking o me ."
9154,i believe it . the pentateuch is the first five books of the bible .
9155,that 's a good point because i believe that sand the torch are the same .
9156,"hello , are you a fan of the nfl ?"
9157,"i like to watch football , yeah , no way favorite sport but its nice"
9158,yeah i watch it from time to the too . do you like tom brady ?
9159,"he in he qb for the patriots right t ? i guess he is a great player , i watched the last super bowl and he threw an amzing pass"
9160,yeh he is a nd now he is author too . he published a book called the tbs method
9161,do you know what are some of the states or rules of that method ?
9162,"i am not sure actually speaking of qb , do you know o benjarvus greenellis ?"
9163,"yeah , i hae heard about him , he also played for the patriots right ?"
9164,yeah and he is the guy that never fumbled the bal in his career
9165,"he never fumbled a ball ! wow , that is amazing , i dont no which about football , but that seems like a hard quest ."
9166,it sure does and good for im 3d o you know that visitor locker room at u og iowa is pink ?
9167,"it is ? that sounds like a great tactic to skate th mother tea mma , college football sounds fun ,"
9168,i think that is what it is . do you know what the highest score i football is ?
9169,"so , not really i know more about soccer the football but if you know can you please tell me ?"
9170,the highest score is 2220 when georgia tech beat cumberland . what a game
9171,"thats rounds like a massacre lol , and also a really boring game , who looses by 222 points ?"
9172,i know right ? on another topic do you know much about the bible ?
9173,"no not really , i did rear some verses when i was a little kid , are you a religious person ?"
9174,"i am not actually , just know some facts about hte bible , how it was in the education system until 1963"
9175,"i do remember as theory about the babel tower , i then learn that might be ar real to r ."
9176,yeah it seems it is the etemenanki in the modern day iraq
9177,"it must be a really nice building , a lot of history in one place , really interesting indeed ."
9178,"hey , have you heard about that new lifestyle plan that tom brady came up with ?"
9179,hi ! no i have not . what is it ?
9180,he 's called city ' the tebow method ' . sounds a little crazy to be treating footbal a sa lifestyle .
9181,do you know how many teams are in the nfl ?
9182,"16 in the nfc and 16 in the afc , so that makes 32 !"
9183,how many teams got o the play offs ?
9184,"the nc and the afc each send 6 , so there are 12 teams in the playoffs for the super bowl ."
9185,th average nfl gem only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
9186,"they sure can drag those 11 minutes out ! m be that 's why tom brady is doom cs well for 40 , in he 's only playing 11 minutes a game ."
9187,true ! did you know tha 'the new arenas saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as an nfl player ?
9188,no i did n't ! that seems a little extreme .
9189,"i agree i and if there are already at the restaurant eating , they have to get up and leave is a player comes in ."
9190,gosh . i wonder why tey do that .
9191,very strict . do you read the bible ?
9192,i 've read parts of it . i do n't know enough of the old greek to really get a true translation .
9193,i find it really hard to read . i have tried but it 's hard to met o undertand what it 's trying to say . maybe i need to read the kid version haha .
9194,"elementary students used to read it class up until 1963 , so maybe it is the kid 's version !"
9195,did you know thomas jefferson created his own version of the bible ?
9196,lots of the founding fathers had some weird religious ideas . who tid jefferson do ?
9197,"using a razor , he cut out hte 'supernatural ' parts , such as miracles and ther resurrection ."
9198,"yeah , that sounds pretty weird . its o good to pick and choose what to follow ."
9199,or you watch football ?
9200,yes i do and unfortunately the cheers are playing the pat 's this sunday !
9201,i 'm not too into football las it does n't really catch my attention . there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay on average n each game . i know many fans and players view the sport almost s a religion though .
9202,that is ridiculous . tom brady s starting to believe his own press . his tbs method is like he is selling his success in an almost curtis way . ia m sure he is close to retirement and now starts selling a book .
9203,"yeah , he says hi athlete 's bible helps him to stay at the top of his game ."
9204,a true fact is that in th '60s top bowlers made twice as much as football stars . i think the game has become more popular as people worm monday friday and tv watching has grown .
9205,that is insane hat we have gotten so serious about football ; since then . so much that we have tracking chips in players shoulder pads and inside footballs .
9206,"what is amazing that with all here money thrown around , an engineer over his lifetime earns more that the average in player ."
9207,that is interesting . i think it 's silly to worship nfl players . it 's amazin that someone thought that espn needed an emmy for making hte superimpose yellow line !
9208,"that is funny since actors work for years to get one ! did you know that for th new orlean 's team , the cheerleaders cant eat at the same restaurant east he played ? if th player comes in , they must leave the restaurant . i wonder what the rationale i s ?"
9209,"that seems kind offs exist ! speaking of sexism m , i wish more people were into women 's sports . women can play in the nfl if they meet the requirements but i 'm not sure if that will happen ."
9210,atl east there is no written rule that women ca n't play in hte nfl . meeting th requirements would be difficult !
9211,"yeah , i heard that there is a talented kicker who might change that . speaking of talented players , benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career ."
9212,"i wonder how much he gets to p , ay ? speaking of tom brady becoming his own religion , did you know that teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams are the only two presidents thatd id not use a able to be sworn into office ?"
9213,"i wonder why that is ! yeah , tom brady wants to fin the meaning of life through his own way , thouhg football ."
9214,"and he will have a lot o followers ! did you know that thomas jefferson created his own version of the bible cutting cout the supernatural parts m miracles , ?"
9215,"hmm , that is kind of extreme . though , that is regarded as canonical varies depending on different tradition and groups ."
9216,it is also thought that an apple became known as an apple when the bible was translated into latin . malus means bt apple and evil in latin .
9217,"i find it interesting how the hebrew bible , greek septuagint and christian old testament all overlap"
9218,the biblical tower of babel is likely w real building the etemenanki in iraq . yes it is interesting how many facts overlap !
9219,even among christian denominations there is disagreement about what should be inc ; used .
9220,do you like football ?
9221,"goods morning ! i do enjoy a good football gram read while i am not a patriots fan , i certainly appreciate hid goo they and tom brady are ."
9222,i like the patriots . they are like the lannisters of football .
9223,"sweet got reference ! i think tb and coach bilichick are in a powers struggle now and neither wants to be it out in the cold , while wanting to prove that they can wi without the other ."
9224,it can see that
9225,i 've learned that tb is achieving cult ike status among the fitness or health community or his routine an dregumen that keeps im in top shape that translates to winning on thye footbal field
9226,well he ia an expert stand has proved it given his performance
9227,"it make me wonder , with his lie so seemingly perfect , career , family , celebrity , , if a scandal is on the horizon again . bigger than deflategate , more like the one that his older , robert kraft just got tangled up in ?"
9228,who knows . i feel hat sometimes celebrities got it hard with their lives under a microscope end paparazzi .
9229,"i could also be because so peopel are very jealous of others success , that they look for way to bring the down . some critics of tb are pretty strongly against him"
9230,that is a shame .
9231,"i ca understand some of the criticism , especially from football tourists that want athletes to just shut up and play the game . times have changed and today its ll about brand and q ratings"
9232,so is there any team of player you follow in particular ?
9233,". did not have a lovely team where i grew up , nor did my family have an allegiance to a team wo i do n't really have a favorite per se . but now , , even goin phoenix , i can not help but follow the cardinals , although i do n't really root for them some of heir players are very popular . you ?"
9234,i personally like the patriots
9235,right ! wat 's not o like the pinnacle of success and achievement . the boston esports scene has had a lot of recent success
9236,teh lannisters of football
9237,"yes ! the analogy between football and religion is very true for some fans , a nd now that tb has his ' bible ' , it 's even more prevalent malone n evans i suppose"
9238,i mean some fans are very dedicated . some even play fantasy football .
9239,"i play fantasy football , not am totally able to separate fantasy from really . i have a great time playing im the league with my good friends !"
9240,"indeed . in ny case , thanks for chatting ."
9241,"hello , do you wathc th nfl ?"
9242,"i do , i do the nfl , love football , what about you ?"
9243,yes me too . did you know women can play too ?
9244,like in an actual league game ? they can ? there 's no rule against it ;
9245,"nope where is no written rule so if they qualify , then they are allowed to play"
9246,"oh i see , that is interesting"
9247,"maybe there are some tough women out there , you never know . do you know what th highest score in an nfl game is ?"
9248,"its 222 to 0 right ? i really matching a documentary about that , it was georgia tech against some otter team"
9249,yeah they played against the cumberland and totally crushed them and went into history
9250,no one wants to be remembered as the team that lost by 222 points
9251,yeah exactly . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?
9252,"no , who is he ? is he a football player on the 222 point losing team ?"
9253,actually he was a qb fort he patriots who never fumbled the ball
9254,"o hi see , never fumbled ? wow , that is amazing , i wonder why i never heard of him adore , i have to coogler i mu now"
9255,yeah he was pretty amazing . apparently bowlers made more than football players back in hte 60s
9256,"theyd id ? well football what a popular sport back then , at least not as popular as it is now so it does make sense , i dont see a bowler making more money than az pro football player now"
9257,"yeah things have really changed now . on another topic , i you know much about the bible ?"
9258,"non ot really , my grandmother used to be really religious but im not , i have read some verses of hte sacred book though"
9259,o hi see . did you know that in school it was part of the program enforce 1963 ?
9260,"i didnt know great , what are your thoughts on this ? i think religion should be imposed"
9261,i like the fact that it i also longer the case . religion should be a free choice .
9262,hi . do you like football ? are you familiar with the nfl ?
9263,"nfl ? is that the national football league ? yes , i 've heard of it . the football that i know is with a round ball ."
9264,oh okay . the nfl is a professional american football league .
9265,now i am understand . the american football is the nfl . i am not so familiar with it .
9266,it has 32 teams . they have games from september to december .
9267,its sound like intense . is it a game that many peopel watch ?
9268,lost americans at the games . nfl and football are very popular in the united states .
9269,i am impressed . this game must be very good . do you have a tea that you like ?
9270,i like 49ers since i used to live in san francisco . they are not very good though . i was a long time ago since they won the superbowl . they belong to the nba asap .
9271,san francisco sounds like a great team . other cities have teams . who is the best team now ?
9272,the patriots . they won five championships .
9273,they have won the most championships ? and they are the est now ? i guess everybody admires them for their prowess .
9274,yes . are you familiar with tom brady ? he is their qb .
9275,"i do not know . well , maybe i have heard the name but not know . the qb ? is it a special thing ?"
9276,it stands for quarterback . quarterbacks are leaders of offensive team .
9277,he is a leader . i guess his is why the patriots are so good at championing .
9278,i think so . tim brady is the team 's quarterback .
9279,there is a tim and a tom ? are they brothers ? it must be hard to share leadership . his is special graet trey hav e .
9280,it was a typo . what i meant was tom brady . he was the quarterback who least he team to five superbowl championships .
9281,i think this game of nfl and the teams in tom or tim bradys sounds like a very american sports . much courage and leadership . thank you for teaching this things to me .
9282,i 've got to run . it was nice chatting wit hyou .
9283,please run ! thanks
9284,you can read more about one on the internet . sorry for the typo . the quarterback of the patriots is tom brady . bye .
9285,are you a tom brady fan .
9286,"yes , i really admire his hard working kills amish is commitment to the team and support as i 've come to learn in the documentary ' tom vs time ' have you seen it ?"
9287,"i have not seen it but it sounds interesting . apparenlty football has come his religion , what ever thati means ."
9288,"football has become his religion an for some , tom brady has come their religion or somebody they worship . there 's even a creed for the patriot 's coach ' in bi , l we trust ' , that ' seems a little extreme to me ."
9289,yeah hat and the fact the some fans have deemed him their messier .
9290,"crazy ! but ot as crazy as how the saints cheerleaders are treated , did you hear about that ?"
9291,yeah i think that 's pretty sexist . way beyond the confined of fraternization .
9292,"yeah exactly ! but the again at the same time , women are allowed o play in the nfl , though i do n't think i have heard anybody coming close to joining the league , have you ?"
9293,i hav know and i 'm not being sexist i hope they do n't . they last thing i want the see is 135lb pound dr being hit by a 1955 ; b linebacker . i do think they should form a league like the wnba . what do you think ?
9294,"i understand what you mean , but i think there would be so physical requirements you have to meet in harder to play , or i mean , survive an attack from pu pound lieabcker ! another way of looking at it is women are smart enough to not play that intensive sport ! if there was a wnfl , i do n't think the ratings would be too hot compared ton fl ."
9295,i do even more so than the wnba . but i agree with what you said about women being smart enough to stay away from it . especially now that we know for sure about the brain injuries that it can cause .
9296,"yeah , even with only 11 minutes of live gameplay , i do n't think it 's worth the risk . but even still , eleven minutes of live gameplay and i devote my entire sunday to the sport !"
9297,"i know right , i just do n't see how those figures can be right . ahve you ever had avocado ice cream ?"
9298,"yeah , i think its a little on too . no , is avocado icecream the next big thing ? like poke ?"
9299,poes ? no apparently tom brady swear by it it 's part of his tbs method program .
9300,"the sushi thing that came from hawaii or something , called poke . oh wow . , is that his diet regiment ? tbs ?"
9301,"it 's part of the plan he has for his life . joy , peak performance and plenty of avocado ice cream ,"
9302,"oh wow , i wonder if avocado prices increased as a result of his book , do you know by chance ?"
9303,i do n't for sure but i would gather theyd id . you know the highest scoring football game was a college game in 1916 ?
9304,how high of a score did the game get to ?
9305,georgia tech ut a hurting on cumberland 2200 .
9306,"wow , they did n't even score any points ! i think my pride would be quite ruined if i was on the losing team ."
9307,"helo , how are you ? do you like football ?"
9308,yeah footbal list pretty col and fun tow hatch . ca n't say i would be willing to make a religion out of it though l
9309,dis you walt 'the superbowl ?
9310,super bowl lii yes i watched it . he patriots won againt the falcons .
9311,are you a patriots fan ? what is your favorite team ?
9312,i did like the patriots before but then brady decided to start q religion based on football . . ? that 's just a bit strange for me lol know ?
9313,i agree . i still like the pats they are my home team . did you know in the 60 's the best bowlers made more than the top nfl players ?
9314,"really ? wow i had no idea tht bowlers made so much money . i did hear that there was a football game that ended 220 , that 's literally one for the record books ."
9315,wow that 's amazing . i ca n't believe tht espn won an emmy for creating the yellow first down line .
9316,"yeah , that 's an interesting thing o win an emmy fo , you know they say a footballs one only has 11 minutes of gameplay . . . but that only counts the time the ball is loving ."
9317,"wo that 's incredible . four hours of tv for only 11 minutes of game play , incredible !"
9318,"yeah . . . there 's also all kinds of wacky rules . the nfl as well . for example , cheerleaders of the saints ca n't eat in the same restaurant as an nfl player . weird , huh ?"
9319,that 's bizarre and sexist . did you know the university of iowa 's locker room for the visiting team is painted all pink ?
9320,really ? weird you 'd think with such a macho sport it would be som tough color . . . but perhaps it n attempt o demoralize the opposing mean . i do know the nfl has tracking chips to record the players on the field .
9321,i would agree with the demoralizing . did you know where is no rule against women playing in the nfl if they can make the requirements ?
9322,"yeah . . . they 're technically allowed to play but now ar none haven et the requirements and actually made ann fl team . irma guessing the requirements for the patriots include saying ' in bill wet rust ' , hahaha ."
9323,did you know that benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled ?
9324,"really ? pretty impressive for someone with a career as along ace his to have played that , no and never fumbled once ."
9325,"i like the patriots and all but some of that stuff is just beyond me . i really enjoy watching th came , but some people take it too far . supposedly tom brady is never eaten as strawberry , so weird ."
9326,"wow , that is pretty strange . it really shows the divide we have between celebrities and regular people ' . still , that tbs methods would not sell of some random person wrote it and not tom brady ."
9327,"i do n't really care about celebrities , they are just people . i did n't even know he ' wrote ' a book , and to call it a bible how distasteful ."
9328,"yeah . . . e can get away with it because he 's famous . i 'd hate to see what people would do to me if i did that . but hey peopel seem to believe it , or a treat believe that brady believes in it ."
9329,"i just do n't get that at ol celebrities are just people , some are good athletes or actors or what ever the case it 's crazy the lengths some people go to , to idolizec celebs ."
9330,"yeh , people do some crazy things o praise celebrities . well i think the both have other things to get back to so 'll talk to you later ok ?"
9331,"sounds good , the care ."
9332,alright .
9333,"hello , are you a fan of the nfl ?"
9334,"i am , i really enjoy the heart and soul of the game . i truly believe that it 's a divine game . and you ?"
9335,i love the game too . do you have a favorite team o player ?
9336,i do . i ? m a patriots fan true and buy . i believe that i can truly be its own religion .
9337,yeah i love the patriots and brady too . did you know he is the author of a book as well now ?
9338,"i recently saw that . it really makes sense , i get , who does n't want to be like tom brady , i can understand why some people see him as a kind of messier . do you think he 's charismatic ?"
9339,"yeah i think so , he has made a career everywhere . did you know omen can play in the nfl too ?"
9340,interestin ! i had n't realized that . though i think they would have a tough time meeting the eligibility reauireemnts . did you kno wthe track players movements with chips ? very 1984
9341,yeah i think hey are collecting stats like velocity and rotation and such . i hope they can use that data to make theme safer
9342,"yeah , but should football really be safe ? think of all the money hey get paid ! its or sr entertainments !"
9343,i know but just to spare them the concussions . in the 60s bowlers made more money than footbal players
9344,"wow ! thoug hi suppose their average ti , e is short actually playing in the nfl . in the land run an engineer will make more . it stil . i suppose you would want to make the game as safe as bowing ?"
9345,"i am not sure . tthat would work , bowling is a pretty slow game . did you hear about that game between georgia tech and cumberland back in 1916 ?"
9346,2220 ! insane ! did you know that greenellis never once fumbled ? these kind of stats are what really makes me interested in football .
9347,yeah hte guy is a legend for sure . did you know espn won an emmy for the yellow line ?
9348,"wow ! and the you consider that for only 11 minutes of gameplay , i guess i can see winning an emmy for that kind of exposure . do you think the bible has any place in football ?"
9349,i honestly can not make a relation there but on the other hand i know it is the best selling book with over 5 billion copies sold
9350,"crazy ! i mean , maybe the jefferson version , where it 's just did advice . i could deal with that as part of football ."
9351,yeah the guy really did not ike hte supernatural stuff to go on ut those pun with a razor . wow
9352,"it 's insane , but you know what he founder a great university , so someone must have been on his side ! like brady , you can ' tube that successful without god n your corner , i suppose !"
9353,i gues she . roosevelt and quincy seemed no otto be religious either as they passed on swearing in with a bible .
9354,"will , you are asked to swear or affairs . so i can see the logic i nit , i suppose ."
9355,"yeah , it is good that they have that option . nice chat ."
9356,are you familiar with football ?
9357,"hi , how ar eyou ? yes ia m . i sometimes watch . what about you ?"
9358,i have a passing knowledge myself
9359,ok . did you know that the nfl has no written rule against female players ? wow would be allowed if they met the league 's eligibility requirements .
9360,"i did , but i don ' know i those requirements do n't inherently disqualify women anyway"
9361,true . i do n't know what the requirements . probably women could play noncontact positions .
9362,perhaps but all positions risk contact
9363,"kickers and punters have limited risk , though it is possible , b ut unlikely , that they might have to tackle someone ;"
9364,"i gyess that is true , but that could be a liability ?"
9365,"ok , yes . it could . i 'm no advocating that women . play . i act , they 'd be better off as engineers probably . the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player ."
9366,probably due to injury related early retirement
9367,true . engineers have fewer concussions .
9368,much less indeed .
9369,"true . engineers probably do n't have to content with pink locker rooms other , or with tracking chips in their clothing ."
9370,i wonder what the nz uses all hat data for
9371,probably see it to spy agencies in north korea . somethings ike that . maybe more training coaches .
9372,lol . but ya i hope they use it to lower the rate of physical injuries and concussions .
9373,the tracking would be good for video game design . kno whoo players really move . model it in a game .
9374,perhaps gaming companies already have to make football games
9375,they might have the data . tha would b interesting . i wish they had attached sensors to bowlers back in the 60s to understand how they bowled . they were superstars .
9376,"lol . i guess ha is true . in any case , htanjsk for chatting . have a nice day ."
9377,are yu a football fan ?
9378,you mean american football or the one with the sun ball ?
9379,am footbal . do you know how tom brady is ? him and the patriots just won th super bow l .
9380,tom brady ? is he the coach of the patriots ? i guess he must be a pretty good chacha then .
9381,"no he 's the quarterback , he led his team to i believe their 4th or 5th super bowl ."
9382,he must be a very good 1 or back then . he plays for the patriot s ? are they in new york ?
9383,new england . theyd id you know that top bowler made twice as much as top nfl payers in the 60 's ?
9384,ia m not surprised . bowling is a difficult and dangerous sport . i would expect that bowlers should be compensated for the risk .
9385,"right i forgot the floor is pretty slippery , lol ! the iowa state coach chad the visiting locker room painted pink ."
9386,iowa is a pretty pink state in general . i guess that is to raise awareness of breast cancer .
9387,i 'm pretty sure it was a psychological strategy . i think they 're putting tracking chips inside th footballs as well ;
9388,iowa pour teaching chips in the footballs ? ! is n't that cheating ? they should not have that advantage .
9389,"sorry i meant the nfl is not only putting tracking chips in hte shoulder pads but also the footballs , lol !"
9390,"oh , ok . i guess the nfl is worried about losing footballs . i thought they were pretty easy to keep track of . the players need to be tracked ? i guess they get around quote a bit , too ."
9391,"they will rerecord a players movements on the field and the velocity , rotating and blacks peed ."
9392,"o k , that 's good . the players should have their privacy . neat would be worse than facebook ! lol i guess they use that data for all kinds o strategizing ."
9393,yeah apparently tom bad has a big for avocado ice cream . have you ever had it ?
9394,"what ? that sounds awful . why avocado ice cream ? why not strawberry ? that 's natural . well , he 's the coach . he ca n't what he wants ."
9395,' quarterback ' you know the patriots also produce a car at never fumbled the ball in his career .
9396,"oh , he is n't the ' full ' coach . i get ya . is n't the rb supposed to fumble 'the ball ? isn ; t that how they get it to the receiver ?"
9397,"note t all , but thanks for making this a good chat . the rb or running back runs the all into the end zone with out fumbling it ."
9398,"hello , do you watch football ?"
9399,"not too often , but i ' k familiar with some of it because my qb is a big fan , even got a football scholarship in collie . ,"
9400,"oh nice , that is a sweet deal . does he go to u of iowa by any chance ?"
9401,"no , he choose u of arkansas to attuned a this was back in the mid nineties or so . . ca n't remember the exact date . , why , did you o to u of iowa or something ?"
9402,no i was just wondering because htey have that visitor locker room that is painted pink
9403,"oh , yeah , i heard about that ! that 's kind of funny . i did somewhere teh did an experiment where trey painted a weight lifting room pink and found that th eyesight lighter suddenly couldnt ' lift as much as before . guess iowa i trying to psyche out dig 's opponents . hehe ."
9404,nice did not know about that other one but explain he reasoning behind it . do you know what the highest score in football history s or
9405,"actually , i do . it wa like 222 to zero . someone got beat pretyy badly ! i wonder if the other team was even trying or if they 're opponents were just that he . . ."
9406,yeah it was georgia tech that beat cumberland . i bet you they are still bragging about thati o this day
9407,"you know espn won an emmy for creating the yellow line representing first down . it 's amazing waht they can do with graphics nowadays during football games . i remember when all we had where the like coal lines , usually wit hoe montana narrating , . lol"
9408,"yeah go figure , things have moved along pretty fast for sure . do you know who benjarvus greenellis is ?"
9409,"i 'm assuming he 's a footbal player , but other than that . . . , scruggs ,"
9410,yeah hue is a former qb who never fumbled the ball in his career
9411,"that 's pretty amazing ! you know what 's crazy though ? for asl hong as games last , theres actually only about 11 minutes of live game play for each game ."
9412,that is mind blowing and yet we are glued to the tv for so long .
9413,"waht 's alston eat is how closely they keep track o everything in the am . i mean , thy got chips in the shoulder pad to the players and inside he football stop track speed rotation , etc . i guess there 's nothing that does n't get recorded somehow !"
9414,yeah that is pretty cool . i hope htey can use those stats to more the game safer too . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
9415,"no , what was that all about ?"
9416,sell htey are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players
9417,"wow , that 's pretty strict ! guess they 're really big in hat ' n fraternizing ' rule ! ca n't imagine why they 'd want the players to stay away fro mothe attractive , young cheerleaders ! lol"
9418,yeah i guess but still very odd rule if you ask me
9419,are you a football fan ?
9420,"yes , i love football ! did you know that female players are slowed , there just are n't any that have met eligibility requirements ."
9421,i ponder what the eligibility requirements are . i think there wil ; l be a female kicker someday .
9422,that would be awesome to see ! first new arenas needs to get with the times and give their cheerleaders normal rights and not make him subserviant to the players
9423,"absolutely , making a saints cheerleader leave a restaurant if a saints player comes in is just foolish and should e illegal ."
9424,should be illegal ! did you know in the 60s bowlers made more than fooball players ?
9425,"wow , that is hard to believe . i am guessing tv revenue changed what quickly ."
9426,probably . speaking of tv . . . did you know that espn won an emmy for their first down yellow line they superimposed i tv ?
9427,i did and that emmy was well deserved . i ca n't imagine rewatching football without teh yellow line telling me where the first down is . it makes football more exciting seeing a player stretch and reach for the yellow line .
9428,i love the yellow line so that i know where they need to get to . how do you feel about the using tracking chips in the shoulder pads ?
9429,"i did not know about the tracking chips . i guess it make sense because sometimes they get the top speed of the running backs or total distance traveled , not in a straight line , and i would guess these tracking chips is where they get the information ."
9430,"yes , sometime si think we 're getting too tech in the sport because they aks have chips in the footballs ."
9431,i wonder with the chips if eventually w to n't have to rely on the refs to tell if a player broke the plane of the end zone and scored . maybe the chip in the real can tell us .
9432,"you 'd think taht would already be known since the chips are supposed to tell velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location . . ? but i wonder who gets that info and when ?"
9433,interesting . maybe the information is n't related in real tiem . it woud be neat if there lights surrounding the end zone and when the chip broke the end zone the lights would flash or would be cheesy .
9434,i think that would be cheesy and too alike to hockey . what do you think of tom brady ?
9435,i think brady is incredible . he seems to be able to balance his family life wath a compete obsession with football . when he said he was going to play until 5 i di n't believe i but now i am hanging my mind .
9436,i 'm not a fan of him 2 i want someone eels veto win nd he sees full of himself . . . . brady is a kind of messier figure for a lot of patriots fans . . .
9437,i agree that pats think he is a messier figure but i dont ' blame chip for that . i see your point though . a pastor in virginia says there are faith lessons you can learn from brady . i would n't go that far . i is think he has a lot of skill and an obsession with football .
9438,i agree with that and maybe a little too much obsession since he had he 's willing to give up his life for football ? .
9439,"true , his family life with his supermodel wife and kids is portrayed as perfect , but if band that a little hard to believe when his whole life revolves around football ."
9440,i completed agree . now i need to go help my family lol . nice chatting with you !
9441,i enjoy the nfl . are you a fan ?
9442,i watch them because my son is a big fan and the entire family only nfl game s .
9443,glad on hear it . out f the 32 texas his one is your family rooting for ? i 'm a bears fan myself .
9444,the 49ers rom san francisco because we used go live there .
9445,that makes sense . are you familiar with the former patriots rb benjarvus greenellis ?
9446,yes . i heard that he has never fumbled he ball in his nfl career .
9447,yes . that is so impressive . i did not know that was possible ! did you ever hear what the university of iowa did to the revisiting locker room ?
9448,yes . they painted the locker room for visiting teams pink . to intimidate them ?
9449,"yes they did . i 'm also , kind it 's some kind of mind g e ."
9450,i think so ew hat do you think of them brady ?
9451,i 'm not a fan . how about yourself ?
9452,i admire him for winning five championship . four or five ? i dp not remember .
9453,i do not even now ar this point . it 's a lot . i definitely think he is a very good . . did you hear that he wrote a book ?
9454,no i did not . please tell me about it .
9455,he wrote a book called the tbs method . its ' referred to as an athlete 's bible .
9456,what kind of book ks it ?
9457,i suppose it depends on who you ask . i believe that he believes it 's spiritual but a critic called it cult like and creepy .
9458,what o you think though ?
9459,"i have not read it so i truly ca n't make that judgement . off topic , did you know that espn won an emmy or creating the yellow line tear represents theft first down ?"
9460,yes i heard about it . the yellow line was a good idea for american football .
9461,it was an amazing idea . i a n't imagine watching without it . i would ge completely lost . they deserved that emmy .
9462,"yes , they did indeed . did you watch the superbowl this year ?"
9463,i did . it was horrible in every way ha ha .
9464,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
9465,every wee . how about yo .
9466,nice . i watch it sometimes only . do you know how many teams are there ?
9467,yeah there are 12 teams arent there
9468,yup there are . did you know u of iowan painted their visitor locker room pink ?
9469,i in know that . i doubt it really had any effect on the other team though . what do you think about that .
9470,"yeah it does not seem to have much effect either ; bowlers used to make morse than football players in the 60s , wow"
9471,yeah i would say that average players make a whole lot more today than the stars did back then . crazy how much one is in football .
9472,that is true and yet engineers make more over their lifetime
9473,i heard taht . did you know that espn actually won an emmy for the yellow line they superimpose on the screen to show the first down
9474,"yeah that is strange but good fo rather , i guess it helps a lot with matching the fame"
9475,it chess give us fans a better perspective of how far they need to get for a first down . if you think about it . its pretty simple but genius .
9476,yeah for sure . do you know what the highest score is in history of football ?
9477,"yeoin1 1916 georgia tech beat dumebrland 222 04 bet fiery didt want to play them again for awhile , huh ."
9478,i bet so too . georgia tech must be still bragging to this day about that amazing win .
9479,"everything build have to go perfect every play to sore that , any points . usually when a team ets usb y so much they pet off a little bit . the sure didnt on that day ."
9480,yeah exactly . did you hear they are doing tracking chips on the players nw ?
9481,yeah they are in their shoulder pairs i relieve . they are also placed inside the footballs
9482,"yeah , they are tracking velocity and rotation so i have they can use that at to make the game safer too"
9483,lol hope so . its cool all th information they can get these days .
9484,i know so much out there . it was nice chatting with you .
9485,hi ! are yu a football fan ?
9486,"hi ! yes i sm a footbal fan . i prefer the american football than football ' as some like to call in outer countries when referring to soccer , do you ?"
9487,"i would say i am more of a soccer fan , but i follow some football . have you heard of the 1912 method ?"
9488,"i only now that it i something to do with tom brady and that 's what the ' tb ' stands for , but waht does the 12 stand foe ?"
9489,12 is his number that one wears or the patriots .
9490,"oh ! taht makes total sense now , w hat is ' the tbs method ? '"
9491,"it is almost like a religion , especially to patriots fans . they see tom as some sort of messier"
9492,"i can imagine , there are lots of diehard fans of his out here , maybe h egarnered even more of the fans after the release of the documentary ' to me time ' , have you seen it ?"
9493,"i have not , have you ?"
9494,"no , i have n't because it premiered on facebook watch and i do n't use that function of the social media platform , do you ?"
9495,"i do occasionally , b ut usually if something strikes my interest while browsing ."
9496,"would you be interested in watching that docuseries about him ? maybe they mention something about how the former patriots player , benjarvus greenellis never fumbled the football in his career , that 's impressive ."
9497,"that is really impressive . i hope they end up paying him well . not the same as bowlers , who made the same amount as pro football player in the 1960 's"
9498,"yeah and even engineers who make more than football players , considering they only have eleven minutes of live and play , maybe t 's not such a bad thing they 're paid less than engineers ."
9499,"id love to only ' work ' 11 minutes a week and make mil , icons . ha . i realize that there is so much other stiff that goes in to playing , but that is kinda crazy ."
9500,me too ! i wonder if tha thigh salary and the way they enforce rules like making cheerleaders leave a restaurant if an nfl player walks in gets to their ego at all ?
9501,it is probably ar the because of their ego . i cant se easy other logical reason for it .
9502,but i think making them leave fuels their ego . i wonder if that rule has ben reminded becuase i sends such a bad light on the team imo .
9503,"i think it should be , besides the physical requirements , i cant see females wanting to play in the nfl if that is how they treat women ."
9504,"i would think money has a big factor and maybe proving somehting , but i imagine they must get at least the physical requirements to withstand the impact of a 300 pound lineabxker , you think female nfl players gear would be any differnt ?"
9505,"i dont know , personally id want a lot of bubble wrap ."
9506,"lol , i think i 'd want that and also a sumo suit with extra padding on top of tha t ."
9507,hey friend
9508,"hello , are you a fan of the nfl ?"
9509,"i love watching the nfl , it is my new religion"
9510,"nice , i only watch it sometimes but dd you know women can play too ?"
9511,"id id not know that , i ponder if there are woman that good that can"
9512,i am sure there are ten just have no tied yet . it only lasts 11 minutes after all
9513,"do sure , that is so interesting . is nfl your new religion ?"
9514,no i would not say that really . do you know how many teams are there i nthe nfl ?
9515,"i think there are 3 total teams in the nfl , which is your favorite nfl team ?"
9516,i am going to say the patriots . do you know their qb benjarvus ?
9517,"it was their running back , patriots are my favorite , tom brady is my savior ."
9518,"nice , he is a great player for sure . ed you know the are ewing tracking chips on teh players now ?"
9519,"i did not know that , h ow does that work ?"
9520,well trey put them on their padding and then use them to tract velocity and rotation and a bunch of othe stats
9521,"that is crazy technology , probably developed by those engineers making he money ."
9522,moss likely . did you know espn won an emmy once ?
9523,"i heard about that , for the yellow line on the tv right ? !"
9524,haha i guess that deserves an award . did you know bowlers used tom in more money than football players during hte 60s
9525,"i never knew tha t , i bet it is much different now ! nice chatting with you !"
9526,yeah the footbal ; l players for sure make more money now . nice cha too .
9527,good bye !
9528,"bye , hav e good one ."
9529,"hello , do you watch the nfl ?"
9530,hi ! i do ! i 'm shocked that out of the whole 3 hours of game on tv only 11 minutes is actually live gameplay !
9531,yeah thaat is pretty crazy . a you have a favorite player or team ?
9532,my favorite team is the green by packers ! to you have a favorite ?
9533,i like the patriots and tom brady as a player .
9534,i 'm not a fan o atom brady . . . he seems to cocky do me . i also do n't like him being compared to a messier figure !
9535,yeah hat is too much i find . i guess he i silo a writer now
9536,and apparently a little bit of an actor since he 's in his own ' documentary ' ' tom vs time . '
9537,yeh that i true . did you know women can also play in the nfl ?
9538,"i did n't . i know one or two play in college , but did n't think the nfl was that it it . i would love to see one ! what do you think about the university o iowa amzing a pink visiting team locker room ?"
9539,i think it is meant to be some sort of a distraction for the opposing team but now sure how well it works
9540,how distracted do you think cumberland was in 1916 when hey lost toga georgia tech 2220 ?
9541,"i bet a lot , taht is such a high school it is teh highest in thee story of the sport so far"
9542,i would feel bad for cumberland if i was a georgia tech player ! i wonder if brady would ever beat anyone that bad . if his faith would n't allow him to ?
9543,"yeah interesting point . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
9544,i know a little bit about it . did you know jefferson created his own version of the bible ?
9545,yes he used a razor to cut out the supenraturl parts off o fit
9546,that 's a little different ! before 1963 kids in elementary school had to read from the bible . . . i bet kids in private schools still have to !
9547,yeah especially in catholic schools . i am glad that rule does not apply anymore though . religion should be a choice
9548,i agree ! apparently so did roosevelt and adams since they did n't swear in to be president with a bible .
9549,"yeah , they are the only two . did yoy know people believe the tower of babel still exists ?"
9550,that 's awesome ! i heard it was in iraq ! nice chatting with you !
9551,"hi , are you a fan of football ?"
9552,yes i am . i usually watch nfl games on tv .
9553,"i do sometimes a swell , but i cut cable a long tim ago , so it i usually just the superbowl ."
9554,i read an article tha tell does not hae rules against female players . i was rather surprised .
9555,"same her e , ive never seen a female on the field ."
9556,"they allow female players but no one seems to be interested in joining . there is one female referee though , if i 'm not mistaken ."
9557,i think you are correct . i have heard something about he females referee . i hop they treat he better than they treat cheerleaders .
9558,"yes , i heard about the ne orleans cheerleaders . have you hear about the rule that they have to follow ?"
9559,"yeah , they have to leave a restaurant if a player walks in , nad cant eat at hates and place ."
9560,why can not they stay if the are at the restaurant first ? the players need to leave if they come when the cheerleaders are already there .
9561,"apparently ca n't , im not sure that happened to necessitate that rule ."
9562,the media has never mentioned about it . i wonder why . they could influence the ne orleans team to change this odd rule .
9563,i don ? t know if it is a league wide rule or just applicab.le to the saints . it is crazy though .
9564,it certainly is . do you admire tom brady ?
9565,i do think the is fantastic athlete . but i don ; t buy into it tbs stuff .
9566,list his tbs stuff mentioned in the facebook watch program about him ?
9567,i am not sure . i have n't seen it . it might be something that i look up . it woudl probably be interesting .
9568,perhaps i will watch that facebook watch program that was aired on ja 25 this year .
9569,ill have to look it up . i heard three is a tom vs time episode .
9570,could youth sell me that it is about ?
9571,"i havent seen it yet , i know he says he is giving up his life to play football ."
9572,it sounds like football is his religion . i 've got to run now . i enjoyed the chat .
9573,"hey , you ever read the bible ?"
9574,"i have , not really a religious person but used to read the sacred book whe kid was a kid"
9575,"it is the beast selling book of all time . i sometimes read it , however i am not as strictly disciplined likd students that were required to red it in school before !"
9576,"it is ? i guess there are a lot off religious person but there , did you know thomas jefferson created his own version of the bible"
9577,"year , that is impressive improving !"
9578,"it is , he took out th miracles and resurrection from it i guess he doesnt believe in that part of th edible"
9579,it is reasonable to want to only see factual and real things int he bible . it is promising that at least the tower of babel is probably based on an actual building .
9580,"i didnt know that ! i liked to read that story when i was a child , age tower of babel , great story"
9581,yeah . it is interesting also a there is differing perspectives on wat is canonical text in thee bible .
9582,you know that the estimated sales of the bible are 5 billion copies worldwide ! ! !
9583,"personally , i ca only imagine what it would be like to make a book that is that successful ! !"
9584,"im not a his fan of many part sofa teh book , there are many thing stat are wrongs nd proven to be mistaken , science is a better way at times"
9585,"perhaps wisdom can be derive from the actions of thomas jefferson , who makes the saying of taking things with a grain of salt to a far goint ."
9586,"thomas jefferson was a really wise man , taking the supernatural parts frost he bible makes sense , the book itself has many valuables lessons but i dont now about miracles"
9587,"furthermore e , teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams were nonconforming , choosing not to swear in with a bible ."
9588,"i guess they are the only ones , most presidents are religious or appear to be because of the public , interesting ho wthe fruit apple got its name"
9589,"yeah , after the bible was translated . tha nwas a surprising fact to me ."
9590,yeah and the meaning of both apple and evil and the whole malus thing i guess thats why some evil characters have that name
9591,"yeah , history is very complex . who would of thought that an apple was not just an apple ?"
9592,"i agree for me it was just an apple no case about the meaning behind the word , have you heard about that pocrypha ?"
9593,"yeah , there is much difference of opinion very that ."
9594,"yeah various levels of respect and disagreement about it , well its a good thing reading the bible s not a mandatory thing in elementary education , we should all be free to chose our own religion"
9595,do you enjoy sports ?
9596,"i do . football is my favorite , but i like several thrus . i am not , like tom brady though who sees football as his religion according to one report ."
9597,i do like the patriots
9598,"except for a couple of cases of cheating , they are the class of the nfl this century . but gotham chopin has a tv series about has tom brady is beating father time to keep playing lounge r ."
9599,i would say they are like the lannisters of football
9600,great analogy ! chopin makes that point that it is much easier for strangers to talk about sports than about religion .
9601,probably because religion is such a very controversial or touchy topic
9602,"no doubt . htey have so much confidence , faith , is the coach that they have a saying , ' in bill se trust '"
9603,i mean trusting the coach is essential so you d n't make a mistake when ehesitating
9604,"thaat is certainly true for the players , but i think it carries over to the fans . why not ? he has won more playoff games than any coach in history ."
9605,so do you have any favorite team or player ?
9606,i am a oklahoma univerity fan . so i have enjoyed seeing baker mayfield do well in cleveland . cleveland is one of the 32 teams in the nfl .
9607,how did they do in the last superbowl ?
9608,"ha ha ! they were 2016 last year so they were happy to win some regular season get . they almost made the playoffs . there are 6 of te 32 teams that make the playoffs . their other players are young and talented , so they may make it this season ."
9609,that sounds get . they must have improved by leaps adn bounds
9610,they realy did . have you seen the yellow line on tv that shows the line to gain for a first down ?
9611,was n't it done first by espn ?
9612,"it was . it adds a lot to my viewing pleasure . espn received an emmy for it ,"
9613,i seen it does help the audience digest all the action much more easily
9614,yes it does . the nfl also puts tracking chips in the footballs to measure velocity and rate of spin . i wonder if that data will be used to compare qbs .
9615,i hope they use or to reduce injuries
9616,me took . they have them in the pads and that could help on injuries . nic chatting witht you .
9617,"hi , do you watch the nfl ?"
9618,i enjoy watching nfl quarterback tom brady .
9619,"nice , he is a good player . di you know he is also a book writer now ?"
9620,is taht part of his tbs method i 've hear so much bout
9621,yeah it is that in . did you know omen can play in the nfl ?
9622,"that is impressive , considering the new orleans saints rules on women cheerleaders and players ."
9623,yeah that is pretty sexist that tell can not eat in the same restaurant
9624,what do you think that hte average nfl game only has eleven minutes of action ?
9625,"that is pretty crazy to be honest , pretty not . did you won espn wo nanu emmy once ?"
9626,"yes , i heard about that . the yellow line was a big change for broadcast football ."
9627,"yes it sure is , makes it easier for us to ome when we are watching the game"
9628,i wonder if they would 've been able to keep up if the technology existed in 1916 for the highest scoring football game .
9629,yeah that was quite something 2220 georgia such must have been doing something right
9630,i wonder if they could 've accomplished that with pin locker rooms like at the university of iowa .
9631,"hmm maybe , that could be it . did you know bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s ?"
9632,"even today , an engineer will earn more lifetime than many professional athletes ."
9633,yeah i guess the fact that the careers kind to be short they can not make too much money
9634,"combining the two topics , then fl is considering hiring engineers for chips to embed in equipment ."
9635,yesh dig seems theur can no wrack velocity and rotation and such . hope they can use that to make the game safer too .
9636,too true . i wonder what thomas jefferson tight have thought about such things ! he disliked what he called ' supernatural ' .
9637,yeah he certainly did not believe in resurrection and miracles so cut them out with a razor
9638,really ? what did he cut them out of ?
9639,the actual bible and that way he had a version of it withou those parts .
9640,interesting . i wonder if h got sworn in with that bible . teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams are the only presidents that did not use a bible .
9641,"yeah , i have a feeling he used that one ."
9642,"hi there , do you watch the nfl much ?"
9643,i cant say hat i do . i usually wathc around playoff times . tom brady sure does seem to be dominant .
9644,"yeah h eis for sure , he id one of the best players right now . and now he is hte author of a book too"
9645,"yeah , which has also come to far know as the athlete 's bible"
9646,"yeah , which has lso come to be know as hte athlete 's bible"
9647,"peoples who are fans of the patriots see him as some sort of , essay ."
9648,"yeah for sure . stereo was another but here , benajrvus have you heard of him ? ;"
9649,"yeah , was n't he the guy who did n't ever fumble the all ? thats a pretty incredible feat ."
9650,"that sure is , what a career . did you know bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s"
9651,"that is surprising , i never saw bowling az at popular . but engineers make more over a lifetime than football players . so there is some incentive to work hard in school ."
9652,yup sure it and they deserve it . i guess their careers are longer too so they have more tim veto malek money
9653,"very true , even though tom brady is 40 , of starve dont last that long . fooball can be hard on hte body ."
9654,yeah it sure can be . did you kno espn won an emmy once ?
9655,yeah . wasnt it for the yellow line ? that is a pretty neat invention . makes viewing at home a lot easier .
9656,"yeah it was , it sure helps a lot for us . who you know what the highest score in a game has been so far ?"
9657,it was better now tech and cumberland was n't it like 2220
9658,"yes it was , what a game . on another topic cd , do you know much about hte bible ?"
9659,"i do not some . on top th most interesting faces i know is that the word apple comes from the latin campus , which also means evil ."
9660,that is quite interesting . did you know that jefferson created his own version of the bible e ?
9661,"yeah , using ar razor . thats kind of crazy ."
9662,yeah and he cut out all the supernatural part off of it i guess he ws not much of a believer
9663,definitely one who picked the parts that eh wanted to believe .
9664,yup seems that way . it was nice chatting with you .
9665,"hey m , do you consider yourself religious ? the bible is the best selling bio !"
9666,"i bet it has sold a ton of copies . did you know that before 1963 , it was not uncommon for african students fo be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education ?"
9667,yeah . i am nowhere near that level of discipline . times were so different before !
9668,"would you create your own version f the bible ? thomas jefferson created his own version of the bible , cutting out the 'supernatural ' parts , such as the miracles and the resurrection ."
9669,"if someone as well known nd respect as thomas jefferson did hat to the bible , then i think the biber should really be taken with a grain of salt . furthermore , there is much dispute about the bible ."
9670,"the language certainly has changed over time . for example , an apple only became known as an ' apple ' when the bible was translated into latin in the 4th century . the reason : he word ' malus ' means both apple and evil . that is an interestin coincidence ."
9671,"for sure . there ie not a consensus about what is canonical in eh bible . i would like to study the bible deeply someday ay , and interpret what i think i canonical ."
9672,"to probably has value as a historical document . he biblical lower of babel was li , toy based on a real building , the etemenaki in iraq . i wonder what it looks like ."
9673,"that is a relief , i suppose , that at least some parts of the bible can ve traced back to reality , and are not all supernatural ."
9674,"some people think it has no place in government . for example , president steady roosevelt and john quincy adams did not use a bible at theur swearingin ceremonies . i think they swore on the constitution ."
9675,"yeah , and they were the only two u . s . presidents to do that !"
9676,i guess they did not see a need to follow tradition . they felt that they owed allegiance to hte people and the government first .
9677,in my opinion that is adorable . the bible is not even completely agreed on . the american people should not be confuse with such dubiousness .
9678,you ' e right . among christian denominations herd is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon . it ' unclear what accepted .
9679,yeah . there is disagreement bout the apoc4ypha . the apocrypha is even regarded with varying levels of respect .
9680,i think there are usual ideas from th east that have been discarded for political reasons .
9681,"hopefully brave men in politics , like thomas jefferson , will use ingenuity and dissent otto save us and one our eyes ."
9682,"it would be good for people to consider a range of ideas , whether about the bible or politics . the times cage and our perspective must change as well ."
9683,"yeah . considering there is s much disagreement about the bible , we may real a conclusion in the future about its meaning that is surprising . as surprising that apple only came to be known as apple after the bible was translated into latin !"
9684,"translation is tough , but reveals that language has historical meaning . disagreement will never end , so pursuit of knowledge should n't either . thanks for the chat !"
9685,"yeah , thank you too ! have a great day !"
9686,thanks !
9687,bye .
9688,hello my friend ! do you ike football and avocado ice cream ?
9689,football is to best sport in the world . everyone plays ! the world cup is a special time around the globe .
9690,it truly is 21 and its come a pong way ! in the 160 's top bowlers wide twice as much as top football stars
9691,hte bowlers knew the score . football was not the game back then . everyone loved bowling . it 's about timing l historical timing .
9692,"you are right hands ay its o beautifully . since football is a family of team sports there are so many different variations of football stat are known as football codes such as gaelic football , rugby , soccer etc"
9693,"the game of ball played wit the foot . there are many forms , as many forms as there are peoples on this vast planet ."
9694,"yes ! too bad i never ot into sports ! i wish i would have . i prefer to read or paint , more in the art area . . . yes nerdy haha did you know that prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for kids in the us to read the bible as part of school . thats awesome !"
9695,"i guess that would work . children hold now about the world around them , and the world after ."
9696,"completed agree , could n't have said it better"
9697,"i thik that the children looks o teachers lol knowledge , not just information , n ot just data , not just facts , but truth ."
9698,"do , i 'm still looking for truth . it seems like everyone is oj some port of spiritual quest at the same time , its quite beautiful . i can feel i do even brady ! he has a best selling book and is on a virtual mission , e new all the material in the world cant keep usb lindfolded and distracted . there is a whole other world or s out there ."
9699,"i hope that the brady tract ca speed people on their journey to that truth . all seek , few find . brady might my one of them ."
9700,"yes , im going to look into that but i bet he is as many wil , l be . we had about it in the bible . shih did you know the bible is the best seller in the old , as it should be , in a total of 5 billion copies !"
9701,that is many copies . i guess that it makes sense that there is demand for books that he us toward the light .
9702,"yes , its all around us i feel like . life almost feels like ' once upon a time ' have you seent hat series ? like people living under a spell i cant explain it , but like a very of sorts , faint explain it but its facinating theory . like did you know that apple only became known as apple gwen teh bible was trams , and into latin in the 4th century"
9703,the apples is the start of our tragic existence . we must deal with our state of culpitude because of the apple .
9704,"indeed , i wonder why teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams were the only two presidents that did not use z bible at their swearing in ceremonies ."
9705,they did not want to swear allegiance to a oddity . they wanted to swear allegiance to the constituion .
9706,that makes sense and an interesting way to see it . . . i that what the other presidents do or what the bible is for ? im truly curious .
9707,i so not think so . it id tradition to use a bible . i expect that it is unusual it not use one .
9708,"by the way , in latin the word apple ah evil are the same thing ! that 's pretty interesting and i get it now !"
9709,"yes , true . apples are good for health , bad for faith . thank you for your chatting . have a good night ."
9710,haha thank you too ! it was fun . good night ! namaste
9711,"how 's it going , have you heard about the tbs method ?"
9712,"hi , no what is the tbs method ."
9713,it 's a book written by nfl a that 's about his training methods and diet
9714,is that the book written by tom brady ?
9715,yes and h credits it with him still able to play football at 40
9716,it mighty be worth reading because you certainly ca n't argue with success . are you a tom brady fan ?
9717,"know not really , i 'm definitely ot ad devoted boston fan"
9718,do you have a favorite team ?
9719,out of the 32 teams in the nfl my favorite is the giants . you ?
9720,my sentimental favorite has always been the rams because i grew up in southern cal . needless to say i was disappointed with the last super bowl .
9721,"a that was a rough game , at least it was n't as abba s georgia tech beating cumberland 220"
9722,i ca n't eve imagine what it must have felt like to lose that only . i think the gone should have been stopped .
9723,"yea that is a pretty appalling performance by cumberland , there has n't been aw morse performance in over a 100 years"
9724,that 's an interesting fact . what do you think you the team that painted the opposing teams locker room pink ?
9725,i find it pretty funny the university of iowa would go as far as painting he visiting locker room pink
9726,"yeah . bit , if i was on th outer team i would probably want o get back at them ."
9727,that sounds much worse than pink locker rooms
9728,you know the saying he who laughs last laughs best .
9729,well i guess engineers laugh last since they make more in their lifetime than the average nfl player
9730,neat 's a pretty amazing stat . but i an understand it because football player do n't usually have long careers because of injuries .
9731,"well i got to go , nice talking with you"
9732,"hello there , do you watch the nfl ?"
9733,i am really not that into football but i do follow it some . i heard soemthing funny one time . that the university of iowa 's visiting locker room is painted completely pink
9734,yeah i wonder waht the reasoning behind tha that . did you know women can play too ?
9735,wow i did n't know that . is aw that an average nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual play time
9736,"yeah that is pretty short , crazy . do you kno that the highest score in a game was ?"
9737,no i am not sure . i read that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer i more than half player
9738,yeah i guess that makes sense since engineers work longer . the game scores was 2220
9739,wow that is crazy . did you know tht the nfl uses tracking devices in players shoulder pads to track their movements
9740,yeah that i pretty cool . they are tracking velocity and rotation and all that fun stuff
9741,yeah thin is pretty interesting how they d that . on a different note . i found this that in 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the us to be required to read the bible as part of their education
9742,wow di no now that i am glad we have moved on for that . and jefferson made hi shown version of the bible . wow
9743,i heard that teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams are the only wo presidents that did not use the bible at their swearing in ceremonies
9744,i guess they were not religious . wondr if jefferson swore on his own bible version without lab the supernatural stuff in it
9745,"yeah , that would eb interesting to know . they said an apple only became known as that whe nthe bible was translated into latin"
9746,yes because the word malus means apple and also evil .
9747,they say that the biblical tower of babel is likely abused off of the etemenanki in modern day iraq . i believe however that the tower of babel was destroyed so i 'm not sure how that could be
9748,i do not know much about it but if it still exists in iraq that would be pretty cool . do you know how many copies has the bible sold ?
9749,how many ? i do know that is considered to be the most influential and best selling book .
9750,yeah it is and i believe spelling 5 billion copies rants you that title
9751,did you know that the bible is translated from greek as ' the book '
9752,oh that is pretty cool . i guess it makes sense in the brady tear .
9753,"well there , do you watch the nfl ?"
9754,the nfl ? th national football league ? i thought that had even outlawed . is i still ink business ?
9755,yeah the nfl is a really big deal in the us . do you know how many teams are there now ?
9756,how many teams are there ? does each state have a team ?
9757,"there are currently 32 teams and the game season is about 17 weeks , so lots of games there"
9758,17 weeks seems short . that 's not much a work year . and al ot of vacation ! great job ! i she i did one .
9759,yeah that is a good point . i wonder why u of iowa has a pink locker room for visitors
9760,that is probably because they want to raise awareness of breast cancer . al ot of football players get breasts dancer .
9761,"maybe , k do not know the reason behind it . bowlers seems made more money in the 60s that the football players"
9762,bowlers probably were they ideal athletes back in the day and got respect food it bt hey never painted the lanes or the ball pink . little breasts dancer awareness .
9763,"yeah i guess , but even nowadays engineers over their lifetime more more money than football players"
9764,we need more ' pink ' engineers too . that is a better profession for breast cancer awareness .
9765,yeah i guess o . did you know women can play in the nfl ?
9766,that would be a good way to raise breast cancer awareness . they could wear pink uniforms and stiff .
9767,yeah that could be one we . now they are also using tracking chips on the players during the games
9768,i think that ; s a great to track shih plates are at risk for breast cancer .
9769,"they actually check for velocity , rotation and such . i hope they can make the game safer too"
9770,"chaser is easier to treat if it is caught earlier . football really is on hte front lines , i can see ."
9771,"yeah it sure is . on another topic , do you know much about the bible ?"
9772,"i have read it several times . not much of a plot , but some interesting characters in the middle ."
9773,yeah it seem that there is defintely a lot of history in the too .
9774,hi do you like to watch football ?
9775,i do but i do n't get the chance as much anymore . the patriots are on a role .
9776,do you know ow many teams are on the nfl ?
9777,"wow chat a good question , how many ?"
9778,"32 . di you know that the former running back , benjarvus greenellis has never fumbled the football in his whole nl career ?"
9779,i did know that how iconic that he a former patriot . they have good stock it would appear .
9780,yes it 's pretty cool . it 's interesting how ' football ' means a different kind of sport in other countries .
9781,"i know , honestly if ot 's a store played with greet nad a ball then i guess they have the right to call it that ."
9782,that is true . in hungary ' football ' is soccer .
9783,in parts o africa too . in australia rugby is football .
9784,how many weeks are in the nfl 's regular season ?
9785,17 weeks if im not mistaken . then the playoffs
9786,yes you are right . do you know the highes core ever in a football game ?
9787,ww not sure i would imagine it 's pretty high . was it a college or professional fame ?
9788,2019 . it happened in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland .
9789,wow i would have hated to be on the bus ride home . did you know that spun won an award ?
9790,yes that 's an extremely high scoring game . no i did not know the ! did you know that in the 1960 ' top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ?
9791,yeah i believe it was time as much . espn won an emmy for the superimposed line for the first downs .
9792,did you know taht an average lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earning of an nfl player andc n average mil player ?
9793,yeah but i still would rather do 10 and out west mi ; lions than 40 and got with the same .
9794,true !
9795,"you , do you like football ?"
9796,"hello , i love the nfl now thats a real sports league !"
9797,who you know if they have female players ?
9798,"well , it in the nfl they dont but i ' , sure they might have a womans plagues"
9799,did you know that the nfl has no rules against women ? htey could legally play if they met the requirements . what do you think ?
9800,that would b agreat but no woman has tried yet
9801,"i now right , but they only actually play 11 minutes in an actual game . that sounds a bit short !"
9802,"yeah because of the breaks , half times and takeout and calls tha 'the refs make ."
9803,i wonder how much money a player nukes . do you know ?
9804,it all depends on the contract that they negotiated but it is usually int he millions !
9805,sometimes they play concerts at halftime shows . do you lie the super bowl halftime shows ?
9806,"no , i usually chance the chanel during the half tim shows haha"
9807,do you like music and concerts though ?
9808,"yeah , of course but only if i am af the live connect not watching it on tv"
9809,"can you believe that the ramones have played over 2 , 000 concerts in 20 years ?"
9810,i believe it ! especially since linkin parr played 324 in 2001 alone . add that by 20 years !
9811,a creed concert wa she bad that some goer filed a lawsuit against them ! tat sounds funny .
9812,that 's pretty pathetic if you ask me just get your money back and go home haha
9813,"yup , that is why i do not go to these events ."
9814,well l obviously everyone else at the concert seemed to enjoy its l nyt to bad of a deal
9815,are there any concerts coming up that word fun ?
9816,"i have n't checked recently . hey , i got ta go for now it was nice chatting with you . i hope you ave a grea tonight ."
9817,"thank you , good night !"
9818,good night
9819,do you follow the nfl ?
9820,most of . i 'm not an avid fan but i know the basics of it . how about you ?
9821,"i am a fan , not a diehard fan but i do follow the important games , do you have a favorite tea m ?"
9822,i would say the packers . you have to respect a tema that can play outdoors in that kind of weather .
9823,"yeh they sure have a good team nd get to play in harsh conditions , you know a game has about 11 minutes of gameplay , i guess ads take over the screen ."
9824,yeah between the ads and teh shows during halftime and the commentators it i more entertainment or concert than anything .
9825,"i agree , thats why i prefer concerts like the one linkin park gave in 2001 , chat a great concert"
9826,linkin park is an amazon band . there is n't a ton of synthesized music there so what you hear on the radio i what you get in concert .
9827,"i agree and their first album las just great , they gave 324 concerts back in 2001 , im lucky that i went to one of them"
9828,that lisa n insane tour schedule . i wonder if it was all big venues or if it az some smaller ones . that has to take a toll on a person after a while .
9829,"thats about 30 concerts a month , like a concert for day if you take holidays out of the equation , i bet it ws really harsh but made them a lot of money ."
9830,that 's true . i wonder if that is the reason so many bands break up . that much time together is such a tiny space as a tour bus has to get one people 's nerves
9831,"yeah i know i would become crazy after a few weeks or months , maybe that 's what happened with creed , i went to on of heir concerts an di di now enjoy it"
9832,i heard that people were suing them because of all the things that wen wrong it how bad does a concert have to be for you to sue the band ?
9833,"i know right ? and i get them , i want to sue the band as well because the concert didnt meet my expectations at al l ."
9834,they should make a page out of pink floyd 's book and just record a live concert with no audience and then make th video available .
9835,"i think thats a great idea , audience can ge disturbing so that might helo them although i think the band is n't together anymore"
9836,lawsuits probably had something to do with that . hard to keep a and together when the money inst there and the band us n't performing wells t al l .
9837,"i agree , so do you follow politics ?"
9838,i really do . i think in this day and age with all the controversy it is important to stay informed . what about you ?
9839,"i do like ? follow politics , irs important to know what happening in th country , hue decisions that are being made ."
9840,what re your thought on the colin kaepernick 's dismiss of his complaint ?
9841,"i 'm no sure , oi do n't follow it that closely . anytime there is an arbitrator it generally is n't favorable to the nonbusines strife ."
9842,very true ! i support colin 's cause .
9843,"interesting , i would care less what he is doing tp be honest . i do n't follow football ."
9844,her has a very good attorney in apt garages .
9845,i 've never heard of him . did you knoe the nfl uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads to record their moves ? seems ram
9846,how hitech of them ! i wonder if all 33 teams use that technology .
9847,i 'm fairly certain they do . seems like an immense amount of money to pay through . k wonder who provides the technology ?
9848,gret question . if we unplayed i would like to see the differences in heir results . women can play if they met eligibility requirements .
9849,there were women players when iowas in high school . apparently the foo fighters played a concert so loud it showed up on new zealand 's seismic monitors .
9850,i love the foo fighters almost as much as i love linkin park . i saw one of their 324 concert in 2001 ?
9851,"they are pretty good , have you ever even the , live ?"
9852,i have ! they are much better than creed . fans filed lawsuits in 2002 against reed for a bad concert .
9853,"really ? that is sort of surprising . i 've never seen reed , but there music does not seem all that co , plex to play ."
9854,"i was surprised bout that too . singers make a lo so money , but not as much as presidents . jkf , washington , and jefferson were quite wealthy ."
9855,well i 1924 deep purple took the world record for loudest concert ever . apparently some of the audience was gendered unconscious .
9856,i ca n't even imagine how scary that must have been !
9857,i wonder if it is due to the fact that they blew ther ears out ?
9858,concerts are live so you never know what to expect !
9859,exactly ! i 've been to a bunch . did you know lincoln was the first president o be photographed for his inauguration ?
9860,pretty cool for the 16th president ! i hope he got the live in the white house guest house which is larger than the white house !
9861,hi how are you ? what do you think of he presikdecny ?
9862,i think it 's accumulated way too much power and should be stripped of most o them especially the war powers and national emergency powers . how about you ?
9863,i think that the president is as good as the person holding it . a good presidency makes good use of the powers . a bad on excuses them .
9864,"i do n't think we should trust a good president with powers we would n't be willing to let a bad one have , because these powers always seem to pratchett upwards and never get decreased again ."
9865,"yeah , once hte precedent is established , it is hard to go back . i am worried that the damage could be long lasting ."
9866,"tie list time presidential powers here refined in at all was after watergate . we needed another process anger the post911 power grab imo , bt instead of reversing all these grant so flower under obama he kept accumulatfing power . and look who has it now ."
9867,"yes , then it one will ave these nad more . i worry about war going on in other countries . we dont hear much , but there is a lot going on ."
9868,"yeah , the president 's power ! start wears is really scary . and the should eb safeguards n the nuclear football too imo ."
9869,"yeah , that would ve bad if things got nuclear . that threat still exists ."
9870,"i was really scared of what might happen back during the war of words between trump and kim jongun , when trump was threatening ' fire and fury . '"
9871,"yeah , it is hard to reverse that kind of disaster . trade ars can be handled , but real wars . . . a different story ."
9872,i was afraid that he 'd take advantage of war to delaware martial law or somethings o he would n't have to worry about being reelected . plus all those cities burning in japan and korea would probably trigger a mini nuclear winter .
9873,"yes , it is hard to kno what the limits of presidential powers ace nunti lately are tested . nad congress refuses to impeach trump , . matter what . why ?"
9874,"i think the democrats are afraid that if they tried and failed , they 'd wind up losing seats in th next election . trying grand failing to remove clinton hurt the republicans politically ."
9875,"ok , t hat makes sense . i was bothered by the impeachment of clinton because i just didnt care that he had a mistress . too many serious problems in would to care about that ."
9876,that seems pretty tame compared to trump 's history of corruption n fraud and mercury .
9877,"guys , those are serious crimes , and the involvement twitch russia really bothers me . the cold war s not over ."
9878,and he 's pushing for a rightwing coup in venezuela .
9879,"he wanted to invade . what ? why ? that is crazy . it ish hard to invade a country . they need help , but an invasion ? anyway , great chat !"
9880,i this there 's another round to go .
9881,"yeah , i usually start dont turn 9 . then we wrap up on 10 . the server has been acting up , so i like to get in and get out . too risky otherwise ; . have a good night !"
9882,you too !
9883,hi do you know much about the presidents ?
9884,yes i know some stuff . do you know who the wealthiest us presidents re ?
9885,"yes that would be jfk , washington nad jefferson"
9886,right . did you know the guest house is larger than te white house
9887,trash that is pretty cool l they must et a lot of people there so maybe that is why
9888,yeah . have you heard the president of indonesia is a pop star ?
9889,"yeah the guy has parady releases 3 albums , wow"
9890,right ? do you know how the vp used to be elected ?
9891,"yes the runner up moved into the position of the vp , pretty nice"
9892,haha i think that is actually fair because they work a lot towards that as well
9893,exactly . do you watch tv at all ?
9894,i sure do . di you ever watch there simpsons ?
9895,ye si lol that show . did you know bart did not appear in an episode
9896,yeah and they weird part is that he was not even mentioned in it
9897,yeah pretty efrang4 . did you ever watch that 70s show ?
9898,i did and i liked it but i guess it did not really take of in the uk as it got cancelled after 01 episodes
9899,yeah but they remade it verbatim so that i guess explains it
9900,"true , how about pokemon ?"
9901,i hair seen some episodes but not al the 750 of them
9902,"yeah they have been in the air for about 16 years , so long"
9903,yeah that is amazing for them to be there for so log .
9904,"hello , do you have a favorite us president"
9905,i am partial to rutherford b hayes . you ?
9906,"ah , mine is probably lincoln for abolishing slavery ."
9907,that ' sa good choice . id you ever see lincoln ?
9908,"well not in person , he died a century ago . however , i have seen him in books and on the interent ."
9909,"hahahaha q i men the movie , lincoln , with daniel cary lewis ."
9910,"have , i was staring at that for a few seconds . actually no , i have no but i would go watch it now that i think about it ."
9911,it was really good . got nominated for a bunch of awards . of course everyone raced about ddl . . .
9912,au . did you know that trump is now the wealthiest president of the united states ?
9913,"he is ? wow , i thought it was like . . . . good to know !"
9914,"yeah , it was him but his wealth is tiny compared to trump 's 2 . 2 billion dollar networth !"
9915,wow . that 's surprising . it 's also surprising knowing hat there was a president called president banana .
9916,was n't h 'the very first president of zimbabwe ? that ie a very odd nickname fdr you president !
9917,yes and yes ! although i could really see 'president carrot catching on . . .
9918,"haha , the president of indonesia has released a total of 3 pop albums while i offic ."
9919,i feel like our president must be slacking then . they even ' released any ! hackers q
9920,"haha , the guest house is actually bigger than the whitehouse itself ."
9921,the runner up used to become the vp .
9922,"yeah , i am glad that they have changed that , anyways , nice chatting with you !"
9923,can you imagine hillary and trump in the same white house !
9924,"haha , no i can not ! they would disagree on everything !"
9925,yeah . it was great chatting with you !
9926,hey there what do you think about the president ? i guess presidential duties depended on which country they are in charge of
9927,i'n ot gf an of the current one but i find pres9detnial trivia interesting . do you know who the top three wealthiest u . s . presidents were ?
9928,i know two of them are washington and jefferson . i know that trump is not in of them . who is the third person ?
9929,the third was jfk .
9930,i do . i wonder how rich president banana of zimbabwe is haha . he may be the most loaded our all of them haha
9931,president banana is an interesting name . were you aware that the guest house is bigger han the white house ?
9932,no i did n't kno that ! does n't seem like that makes any sense to me haha . did you know that ur rules for elections changed in 1805 ?
9933,i agree . mo i did not . how did they change ?
9934,originally the runnerup would become vice president . so in our last election we would had vice president hillary clinton and president trump . talk about a lt of drama haha
9935,wow ! that would have been crazy . we are much too partisan for that now . maybe it would force us to work together more . off topic but do you watch al ot of tv ?
9936,"i watch a litle bit of tv . since i do n't have cable it only watch netflix mostly . i like the show stranger things , what about you ?"
9937,i love stranger things . i watch a lot of tv . did you know that when south park aired their family guy episode the simpsons crew sent hem flowers ?
9938,haha i did lee tht episode . it was really funny . yes i cant wait for then ew season of stranger things . you know who i miss is george carlin . h nwas taken too early fro us
9939,it was an amazing episode . i miss him too . did you know that he did narration for thomas the tank engine . they have had a lot of famous narrators .
9940,"i think i heard about waht . ringo starr , george carlin , alec baldwin , wht other show could have said that they hav so many great celebrities doing voices haha"
9941,irma it surprised that they ot such big names . are you a fan of the simpsons ?
9942,i do like the simpsons a lot . there 's apparently only episode where bart does not appear and they never that about him haha . i need to check that out . do you know which episode that is ?
9943,i do not . i 'm surprised that there is only one since it has been on as long as it has .
9944,"yes i 'm surprised as well . i wonder if there are over episodes that are missing other characters entirely , liek homer for instance . i have n't heard of them doing that though"
9945,i woudl be curious to find that ot as well . have you ever watched the pokemon cartoon ?
9946,i have seen tha shop . i used to love it as a kid . my favorite pokemon is pikachu ! what about you ? they also have about 750 episodes a this point do n't they ?
9947,hi ! do you watch much tv ?
9948,hi ! i do watch a lot of t . i also enjoy the internet as well and agree benefits of the internet are offset bt it 's largest drawback which is the acceptance f anonymity . what about you ?
9949,"i don twitch as much tv , but i would say i do have a mild addiction to the internet . i think anonymity is dangerous because people associate the fact that there i sa real person in all of it and we forgets ow to treat people"
9950,"agreed . and there are consequences , especially for celebrities like roseanne . had she sent taht tweet out about calorie barrett under am anonymous account , she would have never been fired rom roseanne ."
9951,"very true , but some people like trump tweet all thet i , as themselves , and no course is take . well except for more internet outrage ."
9952,"that is true . i suppose public officials tie politicians can pretty much get away with almost whatever they want . speaking of politicians , i still ca n't believe only one president has ever held a phd and that was woodrow wilson !"
9953,that is kind of surprising . i would have though more had that distinction . but i really wasnt ' even aware he had one .
9954,agreed . and it 's almost as surprising as knowing the last presiden to speak a foreign language was fdr . it 's like what ios wrong when the candidates who run these days ? ha !
9955,"besides everything ? i heard nevada had an option on their ballot for neither of these candidates . wouldnt that be great ? i 've dont like the selections , we can just vote to gavel a new group to vote for ."
9956,greed . especially after knowing 5 presidents have been elected despite losing the popular vote . one even losing the popular vote by 10 percent . that is sad !
9957,tha isp really cant . i wonder what other countries election procedures are like ?
9958,good point . i wonder that myself ! maybe i can find out by watching a documentary on tv . do you like watching tv ? i love shark tank but it ? ss surprising knowing most deals that are made aide never enacted .
9959,i love shark tank ! i wonder why the deals fall through ?
9960,no telling but it ' worth looking into to find out ! do you also like the simpson 's ? it 's funny homer hed 188 jobs over the first 400 episodes . ha !
9961,"i heard that but i can only ever remember a few . like the power plant , and didnt he work for the beer factory too ?"
9962,"he 's had so many , it 's hard to keep track of . ha ! did you also know daniel radcliffe voiced the a character on th simpson 's greenhouse of horror xxi which was the cartoon parody of twilight 's edward cullen ?"
9963,"no , i ad heard something about radcliffe doing something but i didnt know that was it . that is near for sure . ringo starr actually narrated 52 episodes of thomas the tank engine ."
9964,"did ye reall ? i never , new that ! are you a fan of shakespeare ? i would n't mind seeing the two noble kinsmen made i into a tv show or film since it 's his only work that ha never been adapted into either !"
9965,"that is hard to believe , he has that so many works , i wonder why no one has ever picked up on that one ."
9966,"theatres a good question . hopefully someone will soon ! maybe we should call around and find out ! ha ! speaking of phones , hedy lamarr deserves a ton of praise for his ; king invent the cellphone , gps and wifi back i nthe 1930s . where would we be without her ?"
9967,"wow , all the y back in the 30 's ? it took so long to get all that developed !"
9968,"i know and ca n't believe it to that long . we owe her a lot of thanks ! anyway , can you also believe there 's basically no correlation inbetween bars and connection quality ? that surprised me ! well it was nice chatting with you today !"
9969,"china sure has become a competitive country , what are your thoughts ?"
9970,"i agree , i ca n't believe china has a 375 billion dollar trade surplus with the us . that 's crazy !"
9971,"that is so much money , china is becoming a titan and it kind of makes me afraid , one of my concerns is the trade surplus nad the theft of technology ."
9972,"sure , it is always scary dealing with other countries , but we do get a lot from china , and they buy 130 billion dollars worth of goods from us so sounds like we can have a thing if we can keep going with it ."
9973,"that is a good point , its mutually beneficial in the end , i think its the number 3 destination for our esports ."
9974,"definitely , adn we are pretty are because we are expanding our defense spending if they do try anything , we have several asian allies so i think if we can all keep teh peace will benefit thus ll ."
9975,"i think a war would end us all thouhg , but its good to have allies and appeal strong , i think thats one of the good things trump has done ."
9976,"yes , w really need to stay on high alert at lab times nd hopefully trump did sign the bill to produce more miltary ships from 2000 o 2 . . . but no doubt we have to keep on top of them ."
9977,"i agree we need to show strengh and hope we never have to use it , you know trump s not even on th stop 3 of the welathiest presidents in us history ! !"
9978,"we definitely do need to play aware . he is not ? wow , that is surprising ! is n't president trump a billionaire ? i think the wealthiest presidents had a very good side job going lil"
9979,"he 's not ! his guest house is bigger than the white house so i wonder why he 's not on the list , seems like the other presidents ar crazy rich ten ."
9980,"i would think for sure trump would be the wealthiest q mayor trump could make for pop albums while in offic alike tone presidnet in indonesia did ! haha , that would bring in more money ! even he could have concerts too ! haha m pretty crazy huh ?"
9981,"be he can make it to the top 3 if he sold a decent amount of albums lol , it would be crazy and it is here fun to imagine ."
9982,"would n't if ! i wonder if the president ever goes to any football games or goes to concerts , or rather have them come to hi lol . . . . i love concert sand have been to many but not any lately ."
9983,"i know the feeling , last time i went to a concert it was 2002 , the band was creed and i wa totally disappointed d ."
9984,"oh no ! hahah , i heard there was a lawsuit against creed at some point for the show being so bad ! i wen tv a small venue years ago to one of creed concerts and it was fantastic . but he was deaf and sober by stat time too ."
9985,"i see in 2002 the vocalist was viewed as a total mess , i like the band and they have good songs , s o much talent wasted ."
9986,"right ! but when i saw scott stapp he was not creed anymore i was him doing a solo career , he was pretty high an drunk for many years but he did get better . speaking of concerts , the ramones played over 2 , 200 concerts whilst touring on stop for 20 year s ! what a crazy life !"
9987,"i know , thats a lot of concerts , its a shame i never mad it to on e , do you like the ramones ?"
9988,"i like the ramones but they are not a favorite . i like a few of their songs . i like linkin park a lot but did n't get to see them before chester passed away . . . . . they played over 300 concerts in 2001 alone , is could have tried to go to one then . i loved them , still do but its not the same ."
9989,"im still setting over cheaters death , so sad , the world of music lost a lot that day"
9990,"hello ! did you know that the top 3 wealthiest presidents were jfk , george washington , and jefferson ?"
9991,"bet , i did , interesting . i think they owned alot of land ."
9992,i believe so too . up until 1805 the vice president was decided by who th runner up was in the presidential election . interesting because there probably would have been 2 different opinions on issues of the time in the white house .
9993,"yes , that is interesting . its good times have changed ."
9994,yes . there was once a president banana who was he 1st president of zimbabwe ! lol
9995,"isn ; t that a crazy name . also , the president of indonisia makes pop albums ."
9996,that 's something ! you would n't think he woul dave the time to do that while in office .
9997,"i now , do you like to go to concerts ?"
9998,"i love them ! i , like the small club concerts now . i used to like the big ones that had big stage shows int he arenas . but , not too many bands put on a bus stage how anymore ."
9999,i know wat you mean . although there i am i se alot are coming throughout the year . seeing a soccer tat th ancient roman amphitheatre .
10000,that would be neat ! in 1972 pink floyd recorded a live concert at an ancient roman amphitheater in pompeii with no audience !
10001,the sound must be very good the as well as interesting to look at q
10002,yes . i agree ! there 's another ancient roman amphitheater in croatia tha they still ye for concerts !
10003,i 'm sure that is interestin gas all to see . the band creed must hve put on a bad the to have lawsuits against them in 2002 . i dont now anything about them .
10004,they must have really stunk the late up that night . lo linkin park played a lot of shows in 2001 a total of 324 !
10005,thats ' nonstop touring . i would think it would be tiring . the ramones have played alot of gig jhn a 20 yea period .
10006,how many gigs have the ramones played during that span ?
10007,"2 , 263 , can you believe that ?"
10008,that 's a lot of shows ! that 's soemthing liek a show ever 3rd day over 20 years .

10015,"yeah , like jimmy lure live is fun . did you know that linkin park played 32 concert s ?"
10016,that is amazing ! those kids had a to do energy ! i bet the fans were ecsta6tic about that .
10017,"yeah , that is pretty cool too nba about the singer though ."
10018,i heard that he committed suicide . i wish someone could hve helped . thing were a great band and have a best selling album of the century ?
10019,"yeah , too bad . ever seen creed in concert ?"
10020,"no , but i heard some stories bout their concerts . including legal action taken by fans . tried might have considered releasing a bit first ."
10021,"hilarious . i did n't think they here that terrible e , but ki'gve never seen them in concert to be honest ."
10022,they should play at the amphitheater in croatia . or the empty one in pompeii .
10023,"yeah , thet they should . by the way do you watch football ?"
10024,"i used tow watch it a lot ore . nowadays , knows o much . you ?"
10025,i watch it every year on sunday at the bar . i is something to do .
10026,it was a nice way to spend an afternoon . i try to watch the playoffs and the superbowl . this year i didnt .
10027,"i watched the superbowl . i thought it was terrible , but that may just be me . so boring this year ."
10028,i think it was probably better hte year before . there was a big comeback . this year i was a defensive battle . i wanted he underdog to win . too bad .
10029,"yeah , i tend to think low scoring games are boring . well , nice chatting with you !"
10030,"yes , it has been a great chat ! have a good day !"
10031,you too !
10032,did you hear about aaron rodgers ?
10033,"hi , do you like football ?"
10034,"soccer or american football , i like them both ."
10035,"i like them both too , i di n't realize tha 'the season lasts 17 weeks"
10036,it does i only know that the super bowl is in the first week of february .
10037,they only rest land of the 17 weeks of the season .
10038,yes it 's called a bye wee us apparently the patriots as have their own creed called in bill we trust .
10039,"that is impressive , also you had asked about aaron rodgers , he became the highest ; aid player"
10040,yeah four year for 134 million . wow . and to believe at one time bowlers made more than top nfl players .
10041,he has been the most valuable nfl player twice
10042,well he deserves it e worms hard nd he 's the same age as tom brady so he does n't have a excuses .
10043,"hot is very hopeful , he wrote a past on instagram were she shows he is very excited and looking forward for amazing memories !"
10044,the pacakrds were my favorite team . did you know ther eis now written rule which prevents women from joining teh nfl ?
10045,"that is so eat ! i would to see that apple , but i do not think it will anytime soon"
10046,i think they should just make an all female league like the wnba .
10047,"probably a god idea , did you now there is only one left handed qb in the nfl ?"
10048,thats aol the nfl produced ? do you know ho is it ?
10049,his name is kellan moore ! also there have only been two african american qb that have been winners in the superbowl
10050,"really , wow ! i know teh huddle was originally invented because of a deaf quarterback k ."
10051,"that is a nice beginning of th huddle , who was that qb ?"
10052,his name was paul d hubbard . he you know baker mayfield ?
10053,that is so cool . well it was nice talking to you . have a good one
10054,hi how are you today ?
10055,good . hopefully you are doing wel too . are you on to watch the nfl playoffs this weekend ? the 17 week schedule is completed .
10056,its absolutely ! i love football . do you ?
10057,"yup . unfortunately my favorite team , the ravens , were eliminated . i guess that 's what happens in a single elimination tournament ."
10058,the nfl has no written rule against female players ; womens only in fact be allowed if they met hte league 's eligibility requirements . that would be wild .
10059,i ca n't see it . maybe a kicker . and they use tracking chips i ipads to record the player 's moves .
10060,yea they put microchips in a lot of stuff these days .
10061,"tense are supposed to track 'the player 's moves , as well as the all 's velocity and rotation ."
10062,all that and then ana average nfl game only has 11 minutes of lie gameplay
10063,that 's crazy . did you know that the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 .
10064,wow no i did not .
10065,"yup , it was played don ana 0 yard ; og dirt field ."
10066,the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than hte average lifetime earnings of an nfl player caned an average mlb player . and now lol
10067,that does't surprise me . most professional athletes do n't play for very long . mat patricia gas a nice fall back career . he i sa rocket scientist .
10068,true ! that 's very true and very interesting .
10069,he actualy graduated rom a school was fight song includes some tdigomnometry terms .
10070,"according to canadian aw , all radios are required to have at least 40 percent of the music played be canadian ."
10071,that 's strange for a democracy . did you now that there is actually ar audio station that translates solar activity into sound ?
10072,yes i heard about this also . its been good talking to you .
10073,you as well . i hope you have a nice evening .
10074,thanks you too !
10075,nike you know that a deaf quarterback came up with the huddle ? i guess it would block the other team from seeing his hand signals
10076,that 's an interesting fact . do you enjoy football and the nfl ?
10077,"football is ok , i do n't really like the nfl but i tolerate it , what i think is crazy is there is only 1 lefthanded quarterback that plays in th nfl right now , i wonde him that gives him an advantage"
10078,will the nfl has done a decent job as it is now recognized as among the 4 major sport leagues in north america .
10079,"yes that is true , they definitely are successful l , i guess i do n't get why so many people watch . games when there is , on average , only 11 mins of actual football gameplay in a whole game"
10080,item ay because they put a lot of dedication into their profession . did you know that nfl implantc hips into player 's shoulderpads to record their everyone to use their site for better plays and understanding of football ? they even put them in the footballs themselves
10081,"that is interesting but also kind of creepy , i guess it 's good or getting all kinds of interesting stats , hopefully they do n't apply them to real life and start tracking normal people witch that stuff"
10082,"it is interesting how they are trying to track velocity , rotation , ball speed and location . i wonder how well they have implemented this new data . regarding your opinion on tracking normal people , i agree ."
10083,"ya , and i do n't like that new orleans cheerleaders spend allowed to eat in the same restaurant as players , like i do n't get why they cant do that , maybe inc abuse of sexual harrassment ? but that seems really stupid"
10084,"i think that is more a new one ; lean saints problem than an nfl problem . in fact , the nfl has no written rule against female players"
10085,"that is wild , do you think we 'll see a female player in our lifetime ? what is crazy is that the average engineer makes more in their lifetime than the average nfl player , you 'd think at 'd be reversed"
10086,well i think that is because an average nfl player is active fdr far less than than an average engineer
10087,"that 's true , what age do nfl players usual , lol retire ? i know they get problems with their joints and also brains potentially from all the impacts"
10088,"i 'm not sure , but those 11 minutes of gameplay sure take their toll , especially since they result in severe injuries"
10089,"ye s , it 's n't bee like a lot of it per game , now i know why i got bored watching football ! here is literally not much action happening , it always seems to do cout forever espeically when a game gets near the end and they start using timeouts"
10090,"speaking off football , are you familiar with alex smith of the redskins ?"
10091,"i hav knot heard of him no , i ca n't say i know a lot about football unfortunately"
10092,he is ar movie for the red skins that some feel will lead the new ear of running backs coming around the nfl league
10093,"ah interesting , well they should make sure to putt he tracking chips on him so that they ca study his moves and see how they can improve everyone else !"
10094,"i agree he seems to be good all around with no real weakness in his game . from pass a to running the able l , even in protections , he is well versed ."
10095,"what is his appeal ? i know that there is only one left handed quarterback , and again maybe that gaved him an advantage , what advantage do you think alex smith has ?"
10096,do you follow the nfl ?
10097,not really . i only watch the superbowl every year .
10098,sp you wathc 'the superbowl at the beginning of this moon ?
10099,yes . it was a lot of fun . i was with a big group at joy workplace ? someone in the group won a lot of money and he was really happy . i had no idea that they put chips in the players shoulders pads . that is very interesting .
10100,"it is interesting i agree , especially because of all the cool stats taken out of them , the football alos has a chip . technology is really cool"
10101,i am wondering waht the am radio station is to hear the sounds strom jupiter now !
10102,i did know that was possible it must eb amazing to tune in the radio and listen to the radio storms
10103,"it 's very intresting . i think i had heard of ' foxhole radio , but i had no idea that they were made out of razorblades and pencils ."
10104,i bet that changed lifes back in war m did you hear about that latin news broadcast station ? is been around since 1989
10105,that is really interesting . i guess that woudl be she only ay to pick up latin or try to listen to it ! i rally lie listening to their audio stations or music or dj 's from around the world .
10106,"ish dead pandora radio is a great service what can help you witht hat , do you subscribe ?"
10107,no . i have simple radio . they have an app and you can also listen online .
10108,"oh i see , so you dont have the app ,"
10109,i do n't ha 'the pandora app . there are so many music app it listen to or have now .
10110,i guess they are really i have spotify an heres like a radio segment in it as well .
10111,yeah . it 's really interesting that the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback . i 'm not a big enough person to hav lever played football .
10112,"me neither , it always seemed like a dangerous game for m e , its a good thing we have protection from the defensive line"
10113,"yeah . also , concussions re a real thing . maybe there should be some sort of chips in the players helmets as well ."
10114,they should that way e can really tell the impact of hits and the consequences on the long run
10115,"i 'm surprised there are n't ready . you 'd think tha tthat would also be as important , if not more important , the tracking the players movements through their shoulder pads !"
10116,"maybe there working on a tech that can do that , changing the rules is a must in order to protect players ."
10117,hi ho ware you doing today ? do you listen o the radio ?
10118,i do like listening to the radio it is confusing to me how it works with the radio waves and the energy
10119,the information is transmitted by shifting amplitude and frequency .
10120,yes did you know that jupiter has radio storms so strong that hey van be picked up on am radio ?
10121,"yes , that makes sense . as for ie basically a giant burst of energy . that is cool . i wonder what they sound like ."
10122,i have no idea but i would probably prefer to listen to it rather than a finnish program that broadcasts in latin !
10123,"yes , that news program in latin seem san oddity that would only exist in finland . i wonde row many listeners there are ."
10124,i am ot sure . i wonder if it is on the website where yu can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio drama ?
10125,"i doubt it , but i bet it is somewhere on the internet . those old radio hows had the charm . i should check them out ."
10126,definitely i would love to hear war of the worlds that is at timeless classic !
10127,taht is a classic . i havent listened to that in a while . people were really scared . strange .
10128,use did you know you can make a radio using a razorblade and a pencil ? wwii soldiers did it all the time
10129,i guess those guys have th incentive to put something together in the foxhole . probably not listening to the news in latin though lol
10130,no doubt ! but would that be better than listening to canadian music ? radio stations have to play 40 percent canadian music up there
10131,"i buss everybody in canada knows rush and neil young signs by heart now . yeah , the govt wants to project its artists l ."
10132,i think i am ready for football to start again . do you watch the nfl ?
10133,i sometimes watch . usually i try to watch the super bowl . you ?
10134,"i am a fan when i was a kid i wanted to be a pro player , because women are allowed , but it was not to be ."
10135,"i think that women could make their way into the have . anyway , great chat !"
10136,yes there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay i with could survive that !
10137,i dont think i would survive . 11 minutes of moral combat ? no way . have a good day !
10138,have a great day !
10139,did you know that jupiter as a radio storm that you a pick up on a regular am radio ?
10140,"no , i did n't know that . how interesting ! i did hear that the sun 's solar activity has ben translated into sounds like music ."
10141,"now i if n't know that , did you know that canadian aw requires 40 percent of their music to be of canadian origin"
10142,hope . i wonder what the other 60 percent might b .
10143,"ya , i would say that fro emmy experience that means that 40 percent of th musics on a canadian radio is probably not very good haha"
10144,right ! ! are you interested in football history ? i 'm looking forward to these upper bowl coming up . the original first nfl playoff game was way back in 1997 .
10145,"that is wild , to be honest i kind of thouhg taht playoff lame happened earlier than that , i do know that the highest scoring football game was 2220 although i do n't remeber what teams were playing"
10146,"wow . that must ahve been some bring game ! the game today is so technologically involved . they even use tracking chips to monitor the bell speed , etc . and the players moves ."
10147,"that is crazy , also wild to me is the circular huddle was developed by a deaf quarterback so that other teams could n't read his hands signing"
10148,how interesting ! i wonder how he would call the plays behind the offensive line to initiated the play . since the qb has to call the plays .
10149,"that is a great question , i wonder if eh just did n't and would just do whatever realy they decided in th huddle , but sometimes try have to call an audible , so i just do n't know !"
10150,very are some good qbs in football today . since e i stand mastermind on the field controlling the pays . did you know that russell wilson is also am major league basebal player ?
10151,"i did n't know that , did you know that baker mayfield could beat him entire collage at oneonone halo 3 ? i was amazing at hack 1 and 2 back int he day , i only kind of player 3"
10152,"waht is halo 1 , 2 , 3 ? i know baker mayfield is in the limelight . . . compared to brett favre and john alway ."
10153,"well they are videogames . they 're pretty ol dat is point , but i liked them a lot whe . was younger . i do n't really follow football , is baker a professional player at this point ?"
10154,"yes , young player . it a lot of hype . he plays with the cleveland browns . i believe it ' is first year ."
10155,"ah i see , did you ever play video games ? if you have ' heard of halo then i 'm thinking maybe not haha , but i 'm curious , i gave up videogames a while ago o play piano , it 's been a couple years at this point"
10156,"oh , i love spinal just . i can not play , but can read music and struggle to pay the note . i do n't play video games , but like to play some blames online ."
10157,"ya you 're not missing anything , i realized that all the time i put into video games , i could have pt into music and had a useful skill out of it , so that is why i stopped playing , if you cab read musi chat is almost half the battle haha"
10158,"reading music is even thing , making it come through my fingers is something else ! i 'm sure you chose the better head with your music ! ! thanks for sharing , it was a talking with you ."
10159,"great talking with you , good luck with your musi career , you can learn to play at any age !"
10160,do you like football ?
10161,i do . i played in s and i 'm a chiefs fan . . . i actually like college better than the nfl .
10162,"nice . i 'm no too into football , i guess because each game has only on average 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
10163,i 'm wondering abou tthat . . . seems short . i think it is trump that the nfl has no rule against women playing .
10164,i wonder if we will ever see a woman player .
10165,"i think so , probably starting with a kicker . thy will probably have chips in everything by then ."
10166,"right , i heard that now they hav them in footballs an shoulder pads ."
10167,that 's a far cry from making a radio from razor blades nd pencil alike these soldiers in ww i did . how is that possible ; ? admirable . . .
10168,"i know , i 'd love to learn how to make one . i wonder if it would pick up jupiter 's storms ? i heard they can be picked up by n am radio ."
10169,probably . . . jupiter is so powerful . . . you could probably pick up canada where 40 percent of the music is guaranteed to be canadian .
10170,"aha , i wonder what canadian music i am missing . i only know of drake , justin bieber and celine dion"
10171,i think sara mclaughlin is canadian . she 's great . there is a website that has classic radio dramas that might be interesting .
10172,does that cost anything ?
10173,"it 's free . . . speaking of free , qb alex smith quizzed out of his first two years of college no tuition paid there . . ."
10174,and he started working on his master ? s degree before becoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft . good to have a backup plan !
10175,no kidding . . . he was a pretty good qb for the chiefs too . . . i remember the circular huddle but i had no idea it was that way because of a deaf qb in the past .
10176,"yesh , he did not want the other team to read his hand signal . very interesting ."
10177,times have changed . qb 's are now deciding whether to play football or compete with video games . such is gamer mayfield 's plight . . .
10178,well i guess professional video gaming can be lucrative too . so he claimed eh could beat anyone at his university n halo 3 .
10179,"i did n't realize it pays that much to be in the gaming world . i 'm sill wondering if , over the long run , engineers make ore than the average nfl player . i 'm an engineer and i ai n't seeing it ."
10180,"i think engineers manage their money better than professional sports players though . i wonder if tom brady is doing all right . i 's good he did not give up on football in high school bt hey never started him as the backup quarterback even though they were doing horribly . time to go look up some more football facts , phish as gotten me quite interested . see you !"
10181,do you like footbal l ;
10182,i am a big fan of hte nfl every fall watching the league get whistles from 32 teams to one ultimate winner to great fun !
10183,yes it is ! you see alex smith took so many ap tests that he entered college as a junior ?
10184,yes and was working gon a masters when he got drafted !
10185,that 's awesome . . . . love wheat ease high pai dpr5offessionals take their reputation seriously !
10186,yes bust in area ; is an engineer will make more in his lifetime than a nfl player
10187,yeah . . . but i they control their frances correctly they can make soooo much more !
10188,that is true . all for only 11 minutes of gameplay a week
10189,lol . . . yeah ! now that is crazy that us as fans sit their for like 3 hours for taht little bit of action ?
10190,exactly . now if we could get female players into teh game that would make it more interesting
10191,yes definitely ! i could definitely see a female kicker n the league !
10192,for sure . but probably not for the saints they seem to be pretty antimen
10193,i saw that . . . i do n't understand in todays day how they got way it that ?
10194,yes cheerleaders should be able to continue eating if a restaurant when players come in
10195,i are . . or just make it whoever is their first does not have to leave !
10196,that would make more sense ! i bet they want the tracking chips hey use in the game used all the time
10197,i a sure they do ! i wonder than other sports will start using those tracking chips ?
10198,yes it does seem really helpful . could see it working all in soccer
10199,definitely ! crazy kellan moore i the only left handed quarterback
10200,that is strange considering how many lefty pitchers there are in baseball
10201,so true ! great that . . . have a good one !
10202,hi how are you ?
10203,"im great , do you like alex smith ?"
10204,i . not know much about him other than he played in kansas city ! to you like him ?
10205,"i do like his yeah , he is the qb at e redskin sand i think he 's good"
10206,that is good . crazy how the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live game play .
10207,"it does seem like a lot longer than that , did you hear about those tracking chips players have in their shoulders ?"
10208,yea they also put them in her footballs . as long as brady did't deflate the trackers out of the balls ! ha
10209,"i guessed they designed them keeping that in mind lol , well the chips in the shoulder are to attack every move of hte players in the field , cool stats"
10210,it is funny that the saints players ar forbidden fro reading in the same restaurants as the cheerleaders .
10211,"that rule makes me so mad , the nfl should n't allow that , do you know who coach matt patricia is ?"
10212,i do not . who is that ?
10213,"he is a coach at also a rocket scientist , the only one in the nfl , really smart man"
10214,interesting ! i did n't know the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than football players .
10215,yeah apparently they earn more withou tall the injuries associated with te pot and all the brain damage
10216,that is true . did you know jupiter has radio storms so strong you can hear them on am radio
10217,"no didnt know about those storm s , do you listen to the radio a lot ?"
10218,not really much anymore . i definitely would n't if i lived in canada since it is required o have at least 40 percent of them use played in canadian .
10219,"i think its s good law , it promotes local talen so thats great , a lot of good artist shave benefit from this i think"
10220,that is true . do you listen to the radio a lot ?
10221,"not much , but i do listen to it on my way to work , t here is also a radio station that translators solar activity into sound , guts boring after a while , e"
10222,that is crazy ! nice chatting with you !
10223,"it is , the radio is amazes me , h ow i works and how we use it , is been nice chatting have a good evening ."
10224,"hi , dp you1 allow the nfl much ?"
10225,"hi there . i do follow the nfl from time to time . i did watch the super bowl as well , what about you ?"
10226,i didn ? t get a chance to watch the sb . i figured taht tom brady adn thye pats would win . i heard it was a snorefest .
10227,yeah it was pretty boring . it does n't surprise me that the average nfl game only has about 11 minutes of live gameplay . that seemed abou night for the super bowl lol
10228,"11 minutes ? plenty of time for commercials . i prefer games with flow , like basketball . on a perminute basis , those nfl guys get paid a lot ."
10229,"yeah i agree with do . what do you think about the tracking chip that they use on the field ? like now they get good stats , it 's just crazy that that kind of technology exist to me"
10230,its ' good for understanding the flow of the game . could help understand situations that lead to injury and concussion . player safety is important .
10231,yep i agree with you . i hope they use those stats to help prevent teh brain injuries that can happen . do you like the new orleans saints by the way ? you know hew they treat their cheerleaders ?
10232,"the cheerleaders really are at the bottom of the total pole . long hours , low pay , l little respect ."
10233,"no respect , i think it 's weird that they have to leave a restaurant if a player enters , that 's definitely something that is probably a relic from the past , do you know if other teams have the same rule ?"
10234,i donate not . no saints must have had a problem with relations between players and cheerleaders to create a rule like that . no partying together . something like that .
10235,"yeah that makes sense . because i havne't heard of that rule with any other team . what about the rule for female players ? apparently there is no rule against it , which is interesting"
10236,i guest hey never imagined that some would want or be able to play . other sports might not have such a rule either .
10237,"yeah that makes sense . i do n't think taht women can play basketball or anything like that , at least in the nba l , but maybe i 'm wrong ? do you ahve a favorite quarterback by he why ?"
10238,"genre is a wnba , but the money is not as good . i dont ' have a favorite qb , but i did like joe mountain and steve young ."
10239,"yes i like those guys . i also like tom brady personally , although i know a lot of people do n't , he has some weir things about him like the fact that he 's never eaten a strawberry before lol . what do you think about baker mayfield ?"
10240,is brady a vegan too ? e probably has an allergy to strawberries . baker mayfield ? do n't know him .
10241,"yeah he was a quarterback for university of oklahoma , he was also a major gamer , h e was going to be a prog gamer instead of a football player , i gues she was really good at halo 3 , i was also really good at that game back in the day haha"
10242,"i gues you could make money as a gamer , but the nfl is probably a great way to get people and make cash ."
10243,"yep i agree with you . if you can make money in the nfl , you 're probably better off doing that than paying video games lol . do you know hte story behind the circular huddle ?"
10244,"i believe a deaf qb wanted to shield his hand signals from th other team . i was surprised bt that car t , but i guess any one will skill ; l can plan the game . anyway , i enjoyed chatting !"
10245,"yes i think the circular huddle is genius actually . that ay no one could see the dogs he was making , and that 's could not read the plays that he wanted to do , have a great night by the way"
10246,good morning ! are you a football an ?
10247,"i am a football fan , 32 teams do decision , its a great sport"
10248,yes ! did you know that there is only 1 left handed qb in the nfl a that is kellan moore ?
10249,only one in the whole league ? is he a rat qb ?
10250,i think he 's a backup . baker mayfield from the browns once almost quit football to pursue full time competative gaming . thats sounds like had would have been a scary gamble to take .
10251,"yeah vaping doesnt seem like a rich industry or career path , pro football players must earn more money"
10252,definately ! it pays more to be an engineer than an average nfl or mlb player because over a lifetime an engineer ears more than those players .
10253,"well engineers work for a longer time , so it makes sense , di do hear about qb alex smith ? i think his a great role model to follow"
10254,i did n't hear . what tid he do ?
10255,he took apt est knw thing school nad entered university as a junior . he received a degree in just two years and then began working on a masters degree
10256,nice ! good for him ! did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf qb so the other players could read is hand signal s ?
10257,"i didnt know that , h e left a legacy thanks to that , now all teams do it , i bet he did had that in mind when hue implemented the strategy"
10258,no . i would guess he did n't . i wonder if will see a female nfl player and the soon since there 's written no rule against female players in the nfl ?
10259,i think females are at a disadvantage .
10260,i coud imagine some of the hits . i was sinking like a kicker or a punter maybe .
10261,"oh yeah , those can be good positions , i guess it can happen some day ,"
10262,i 'm sure if they do they will have tracking chips on their shoulder pads like they do know so they can record every move on the field .
10263,that seem bit invasive but i gues shall kinds of stats are taken out of those chips
10264,"yes . they even have chips in the football to track velocity , etc . getting a little too technical i think for a sport ."
10265,do you have a favorite team ?
10266,i like the steelers !
10267,"they are a great team mine are the ; patriots , i think trey share a record ."
10268,football fan ?
10269,"oh yes , i love ronaldo and messi ! ca n't seem t have enough of them ! ; ,"
10270,"ah , how about american football ? it you see the bengals ' loss sunday ?"
10271,"naah , i did n't who were you cheering for ?"
10272,the bengals . damon had a thumb injury that ended his season . can you believe a thumb is that important t ? i caught it on the radio so i did n't really see it .
10273,"yeah thumbs were very important in our evolution : , lol , hey how can one , quarterback k , askew the touchdown pass o himself ? i mean . . . how ?"
10274,amaze it 's time fot a woman to step in nad take over as qb ? the only has no official prohibition against women quarterbacks .
10275,do you think it 's a good idea ? are they physically ready ?
10276,there 's the rub . there 's only 11 minutes of live gameplay so it 's not like they 're branching 500lbs for 2 hours straight .
10277,"i guess you 're not looking for an actual conversation here , just copying the subjects from the article . . . be you not afraid teh will reject our word ?"
10278,article ? i was discussing football . gues the bengals will have to start drivel .
10279,i aged you if you think women are ready for that game ? like physically ? i guess you 've missed that question . . .
10280,"possibly , they should probably protect their thumbs though . you never know that could get injured ."
10281,"with all the money invested in that game , do you think they would risk to out women into the field ? i mean can they be as strong or fast ?"
10282,awsome might . all you have to do is meet the eligibility requirements . if a woman could meet those then what not ?
10283,like i said i wonder what the investors would say if they would see woman in a team they invested millions if dollars . . .
10284,it 's enough of an novelty that in might work . all the moneys ' at the top . an engineer earns more in his or her lifetime tat the average nl played .
10285,engineer ? really ? i saw them numbers how much of players earn . . . little herd for me to belive in that . . .
10286,not everyone in the nfl earns thye giant payday and not all play for that ; only . if you 're colin kaepernick you may get kicked out earlier than you want for your activism and lose money there too .
10287,"i guess you 're right . . . mr . kaepernick better start training old be an engineer ; ,"
10288,"good money there . ,"
10289,waht do you think o eli manning ?
10290,he seems like a nice guy . he 's had a long and pretty good career until recently .
10291,"it seems his most likely replacement , kyle lauletta , got into some serious trouble , almost running over ac op and other things ."
10292,oh wow ! i did not hear but that . has he been charged ?
10293,"yes , the giant have gwen better days . they here 17 when it happened ."
10294,"yeah theyd certainly fell off in theur performance in teh last few years , . do you enjoy football ?"
10295,yes . it looks like the giants have another alternative in 3 years old alex stanley but he has limited experience .
10296,i have not heard of him . hopefully he can bring the team back to where they used to be .
10297,"it 's nice that after laulegta ' arrest , rb barkley stick up a him as a good man ."
10298,"hopefully it was just the mistake and not representative of his character . speaking of qb 's , are you familiar with alex smith ?"
10299,"yeah , he 's th smart guy that took so many ap tests that he started college as a junior ."
10300,yes he did . he was actually working on his master 's when he was drafted . that 's very impressive .
10301,yes . i think i'ts odd that kellan moore is then only lefthanded qb in the nfl . you sees o many lefthanded pitchers in nbl .
10302,oh wo w ! you would think there would e more but when i think about it i do n't rememebr seeing a qb throw with his left and .
10303,me either . . . the circular huddle in common though . it started because of a deaf qb so the other team could n't read his hand signals .
10304,i would think it would be very difficult to be a deaf qb . you could n't hear play changes or calls in your helmet adn you 'd think yo 'd get slacked more .
10305,"yes , that must hve been a long time ago . did you know ww i soldiers made radios out of razor blades and pencils ?"
10306,i did not . i had no idea you could make a radio with so little .
10307,"all i kno is that i would p ; probably just end up cutting myself . back to football , it 's interesting that the nfl as not rules against women playing . go or it ladies !"
10308,i agree . i see no reason even with the size difference why tey could not play .
10309,sure . why not ? thanks for the chat !
10310,i was disappointed to hear about kyle lauletta 's arrest .
10311,what happened ?
10312,he almost ron a police officer over with his car outside of new york city .
10313,"thats right , he was pretty resistant and disrespectful too right ?"
10314,"yes , i heard that e gave them a hard time . i eas glad t hear there was no mention o being intoxicated , though ."
10315,i winder got the giants are going to discipline him ?
10316,i do n't know . i think their hands are a bit tied because there are not many options for quarterback on the team .
10317,i was going stat the giants would put him to play instead of eli
10318,i think they will . eli is already 37 years old .
10319,tha giants have done so poorly his year . it s such a surprise !
10320,seriously ! a 17 record i terrible !
10321,i can understand why obj is so frustrated !
10322,i hope they do better in wee 10
10323,"they have too many talented players , it is time for the coach and walk to go in my opinion ."
10324,"agreed . despite the arrest never , i think auletta will do well for the team ."
10325,i have n't seen much of his play but he deserves ac once to play right now .
10326,it couldnt ? t get any worse and their only other option for qb is stanley .
10327,elis ' job may have been saved by the fact they have won their list couple of games l
10328,"i would n't be surprised if he retires soon , anyway ."
10329,"i was never a big fan of his , i never considered him to be a good qb despite his sb wins ."
10330,"i am not a fan , either . time for some fresh talent !"
10331,i hope they lose this week . . . lol !
10332,do you think the qb is the most important player in a football team ?
10333,"well , he calls all the pages and touches the bal on alma every offensive play . so , i could see him being he most important player ."
10334,"yeah the qb is involved in every offensive play , they are protected but the offensive line , so a good qb will always need a good offensive line as well"
10335,that 's so true .
10336,"do you know who to , brady is ?"
10337,"yes , i know he goat , ne wenlgand patriots quarterback ."
10338,"yeah the goat , the same ne , wool he used to be on the bench when he was in high in school team , his team lost a lot o game and the coach it know about the talented son to be hall of famer qb he head in his rooster"
10339,"what a fool , i bet people still make fun of that coach to thins day !"
10340,"i agree , i bet he regrets not putting body on his team , that guy wouldnt recognize talent even if it hit him in hte face"
10341,"on a different note , did you kno jupiter has radio storms so strong that thy can be picked up and heard by an am radio ?"
10342,"no i didnt know that , wonder what station , the radio is a great invention ,"
10343,"yes , it is . i read in canada it 's a law that at least 4 7percent of the music played must be canadian . have you heard about that ?"
10344,"i haven heard about that old but seems fair , i like it , that way you promote local talent , there are some talented artist in canada"
10345,"i can honestly only think of celine dion n , shania twain , justin bieber . is there any others ? lol"
10346,"yah theres also drake an di bet a couple more lol , there is also his cop site with drama episodes for free"
10347,"i had heard about that site , classic radio dramas you can listen to for free . just how i cant to spend my sp ; are time . lol"
10348,"there is also a latin news channel in the radio , that seems a bit boring ,"
10349,"lol , wonder how many listeners it has ?"
10350,"it mush ave at least some fans , the show has been around since 1989 so it must be popular ,"
10351,"oh mug goodness , i did not know that !"
10352,"yeah sounds boring to me , i dont understand a word of latin"
10353,do you like football ?
10354,i do but i would rather age to the live games than watch it on tv . do you like radio ?
10355,"sometimes i listen to it , but mostly via internet ."
10356,"yes , there 's definitely radio on the internet . radio technology is n't tha knew bu tit is fascinating . radio waves carry information scuba s souds by systematically modulating the properties sofa electromagnetic energy was transmitted through space such as amplitude , frequency , phase , and pulse width ."
10357,did you know kellan moore is the only left handed qb i nthe nfl ?
10358,"yes , that is unusual probably . did you know that baker mayfield , university of oklahoma qb , once considered quitting football to pursue fulltime competitive gaming and claims to be the to beat hayden at his school oneonone in halo 3 ?"
10359,"no , i did n't know that . the nfl puts chips in players shoulder pads , were you aware with tha t ?"
10360,"yes , so they can track the players moves . they also put tracking chip inside the football in well ."
10361,"oh , that is pretty cool . i wonder that they do with all of that information ?"
10362,"i '' m sure that it will give the players more game play time . since the chips inside the footballs track velocity , rotation , ball speed , an location . that probably allows extra time for play since the coached s , and all the other measurements that happen during football games will be ore automated . tha should free up some more time ."
10363,do you listen to the radio ?
10364,"yes , everytime i get it my ca ri do . i listen to pandora tha gives me all kinds of music depending on my mood and playlist . i 've heard that you can evenly listen to old news programs o special stations . for instance , since 1989 , a finnish radio station has broadcasted a ' nuntii latini ' program in classical latin ."
10365,soldiers used to build the lot of a pencil and razorblade .
10366,"yes , i 'd like to learn how do that myself . apparently , you just use a razor blade and a pencil as a diode . i believe tht they were called foxhole radios ."
10367,did you know that you can hear jupiter radio songs on am radio ?
10368,"well , i think it is radio storms that we so strong that they can be picked up andc earth on the am radio ."
10369,"interesting , have you heard the ?"
10370,"no , iv ' e never heard anything like that . i did hear , though , that there 's a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free although i never had the pleasure of doing so ."
10371,"interesting , i 'm not a huge fan of classic radio dramas ."
10372,"me neither but i like to investigate and school . old school is interesting . as a matter lof old school , did you know that the circular huddle in football was created by paul d . hubbard , a deaf i , so the otehr team would not read his hand signals ? that 's cool old school !"
10373,"interesting , well , nice chatting with you !"
10374,"you ws eels , have a good one ."
10375,"hi , do you watch football"
10376,"not really , just the halftime shows . i know joe namaste is stil amy favorite qb though ."
10377,he is mine too . i also like watching all time . haha
10378,ish ear kellan moore is the sole lwf6hnaded qb in the nfl .
10379,"yeah , that fact surprised me because i thought that there are at least 2 left handed quarterbacks ."
10380,"huh ? the huddle was developed because of a deaf qb who had to use and signals for plays , so the other gathered around him . i believe it was a nice dame . term was a , over about it ."
10381,"it sound a bit odd , but it works wonderfully so far because it is the best way to avoid your dallas being end by the other team"
10382,i agree . i 've heard the name field but i think it 's a bit early to say he 's another fact nor alway .
10383,i think his potential is there . but i am a touchy worried thati is attitude is like the ' s .
10384,"well , the qb is the leader ' od he offensive team . lots of entitlement goes with being the leader ' ."
10385,exactly . being a quarterback of a nfl team is not an easy task at all . they must have leadership skill in addition to their football skill
10386,"so , i 've heard one qb threw a touch down pass and he threw it to himself ?"
10387,"yeah , it was nick one , the quarterback of philadelphia eagle in the super bowl last year"
10388,wow ! i ca n't see radio being a good medium to follow a football game . you ?
10389,"i agree with you there because it would be a very boring way to follow this game . btw , did you know that soldiers in wwii used only razorblade and pencil to make a radio"
10390,i heard that before somewhere . i would n't know how did you know king crosby song filed more than half the radio time for recorded music in 1948 ?
10391,"for that fact , i have no clue whatsoever . btw , did you know that our am radio is able to pick up signal of a super radios torn m ?"
10392,no ! i do know there is a radio station that translates solar activity int sound which means you can listen to the sun 's music lived !
10393,technology enables us to do so many fascinating things . and i hope that we will live on the moon in the near future . wear do you think
10394,i do n't know . i know nobody from the nfl ill be playing in that gravity though !
10395,"neither do i . btw , nice chatting with you . enjoy your holiday"
10396,hey you too .
10397,bye
10398,bye .
10399,see you
10400,not anymore !
10401,aaron rodgers the highest paid player in the nfl
10402,did you know aaron rodgers has already made 80 million dollars this year ? even though he missed nine games last year because of his broken collar bone !
10403,"i didnt , he will lso make 1760 million on the next 6 seasons a sweet bonus"
10404,"that 's crazy q i 'd like that kind of dough : ,"
10405,"i would love that too , i would settle with thee 00 , 000 workout bonus ol , a lot of moeny"
10406,yeah he beat out matt ryan ash highest paid player in nfl . ryan 's deal was like 150 mil with the falcons
10407,"wow , thats a lot of money , he will be 40 in 2023 , ye was first chosen by the packers , great choice"
10408,sure if he keeps this contract he would have been with green bay for his entire career
10409,"i think the new deal isp after for him , he has a guaranteed 98 . 2 million dollars from it"
10410,"i like how he 's so flppant about it , like on the radio , espn , he was like , if nothing gets done , great , if something gets done , great also ' lol"
10411,"probalby not the best phrase lol , brett rare was a great qb . rodgers had to wait or 3 seasons until he had the chance"
10412,"right mvp twice , right ? no wonder gruden bay has such a good record they really know how to pick em !"
10413,"twice , that is right , great qb , another great player is kirk resign s , h e once rejected the option nba join the vikings for 90 million"
10414,wow ! did you know baker mayfield almost quit football to become professional gamer ? lol
10415,"i didnt know that lol , he he any good ? good thing he stayed in football"
10416,i trink i nwas just college ball . . . but apparently he 's really good at halo lol
10417,"oh , i wonder if gamers oak eas much money as pro football players , lol , do you know who alex it is ?"
10418,redskins qb ?
10419,"yeah , that one , well , he took so many ap tests in highschool he got his ba in just 2 years"
10420,"wow ! one smart dude . i read somewhere an engineer makes more in their lifetime than a football player . i guess he could do both , if his degree is in engineering that is ,"
10421,"i bet that too , he is a really smart guy , also has a masters degree so maybe its related to engineering"
10422,do ou like nl ?
10423,yes i do . did you hear they are placing chips on the players now ?
10424,what for ? i imagine that is what they are playing
10425,yes during the games to track velocity and rotation and such
10426,nic eli wonde if they can use that to me the game safer
10427,me too . did you know matt patricia is an astronaut turned coach ?
10428,wow that is such a huge career jump for someone
10429,yeh it i . do you know when teh first nfl game was played ?
10430,not ur of had but i know it only has 11 minutes of gameplay
10431,wow that is not ? the first game was played in 1932
10432,cool it has been around for a while . do you like brady ?
10433,i liek him yes . did you know kellan one is the only left handed qb
10434,coo . brady was a backup bbq in nigh school and as never started
10435,wow they wasted a good chance o win some games there
10436,yeah . do you know alex smith completed college in two years ?
10437,"wow stat is supper fast , how did he manage that ?"
10438,"smart kid , took lots of ap tests in high school"
10439,how amazing . nba johnson is the only qb that threw himself a touchdown pass
10440,i did not even know such a thing is possible at all
10441,i know right ? do you listen to the radio much ?
10442,"i sure do from time to time , and you ?"
10443,are you a fan of the nfl l ?
10444,"hello there , i sure am , although my team failed to make the playoffs this year . how about you ?"
10445,"which of the 32 was your team ? mine failed too , it as the vikings"
10446,"oh geez we have sure had our good games in teh past ! you guys had our number hi year , i 'm just east of you in the land of green and gold ."
10447,"packers ! nooooo ! ! kidding , i liek rodgers he is probably my favorite quarterback"
10448,"yeah he ha gotten a bit off his game the last season or two , i was a huge brett favre fan to be honest , loved the way h played the gave , he has some good games for you too , should have beaten the saints that year with the whole bs over paying to hurt him ."
10449,"for sure favre was awesome ! that was terrible ! you know who else was a goo quarterback in the same draft classy s rodgers , alex smith"
10450,"yeah it really was , i thought tha nwas crap . and yeah it sounds like alex smith is a very smart guy ."
10451,"yea , i think he took so many ap classes in high school he graduated his sophomore ear phd kept going from there . then was the 1 pick !"
10452,"wow , that is vey impressive , sounds like he could go into any field that he wanted ."
10453,"for sure , fooball probably made him to most , unfortunately he got heard . he should have become an engineer an madam ore money over his lifetime then most players"
10454,"way that is truly he risk of the pro career , it could nd at any time , its not th exam eas a lasting career of a trade per say ?"
10455,"for sure , valid point . speaking of the saints , do you hear how the treat their cheerleaders ?"
10456,"yeah i think i ahve read abou tthat rule , seeks a brit outdated to me ."
10457,"yea , there is o way anyone would support that or they would be fighting for their rights"
10458,"agreed , did you now that there is no rule on female players ?"
10459,"say whatttt ? i wonder if women know tat , ther has to be one or two that are capable ."
10460,"'s think it is just there is no system in place for them to for their way up , no high school o collie women 's football teams ."
10461,"that is true , i think there is a female kicker that ay be making i tin the next couple years , i am rooting forth er . it ws so nice chatting with you ?"
10462,"yeah same here , i think it would be so cool if a female player made a pro roster . good talking as well !"

10466,"i am , i heard he said jackson will not be a good quarterback , did you wathc him play yesterday ?"
10467,"yes , i know that he is a young quarterback , but either of the teams played wall , i opinion ."
10468,"i do not think so either , but eh was on track to have the worst statistical game for a qb ever . . is young , but he needs a lo of work"
10469,yes he does . do you think he will be the starting quarterbacks next season ?
10470,for sur !
10471,i did n't know bill tolien as general manager had a record of four stat super bowl .
10472,he must have been the bills gm then ! i know they went to four straight !
10473,"i had no idea , i guess because i was so focus on pittsburgh y team and new england patriots ."
10474,did you know the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of are time !
10475,"no , how is that possible when an actually game in hour , but it last 3 hours at the most ."
10476,"leah tey have a lot of commercials , and the clock run in between plays i guess !"
10477,"is , what do you think bout teh carolina panthers and their quarterback ?"
10478,"i think he is good , and very athletic , some qbs are smarter than others thouhg , alex smith took so many courses hes started college as a junior !"
10479,"do n't you think heir quarterback was more of a showboa to i prefer easy going player , and good player , bt not both ."
10480,"i think hd is a bit , but eh works hard for that right !"
10481,"yes he did , i think he was hurt most of the season , but did n't want to come out and say . he hid it as long as he could ."
10482,"yes , which while it is admirable , is not smart to do . he may have hurt his team ultimately"
10483,"you are right , i did n't know police lend the cool to a superbowl . this person did a lot for all ."
10484,"he ours did , and even if he lost them , making 4s straight superbowls i outstanding !"
10485,it 's a shame what happened to andy dalton
10486,"yes , his thumb injury put him out for the rest of the season ."
10487,he was having one of his best seasons so far
10488,maybe jeff risked will be a ot do a good job .
10489,"it 's doubtful , he does n't have much experience"
10490,risked dis get two touch downs after comin unto the game .
10491,i think tom savage will do a little better for them
10492,risked state that he 's always known he could play really wel ; .
10493,"true , he just does n't have much experience , but having a green back should help ."
10494,the medical team send they will likely get andy back at the start of next season .
10495,yea taht 'd be great for him
10496,mj green had been out with a toe injury as well .
10497,"yes , he should be coming back thas week though"
10498,the texans picked up dalton in 2014 when he was 28 years old .
10499,"no , dalton was drafted by te bengals in 201"
10500,you are correct t ! he came from the in 2011 .
10501,"we ; , he 's been their quarterback ever since"
10502,dalton also ahs completed 61 . 9 percent of his passes .
10503,he 's having his 2nd best year ever this year
10504,what was his first best year ?
10505,he had his best year in 2015
10506,do you watch the nfl ?
10507,"yeah , , y favorite team is the chiefs . did you know qb alex smith quizzed own of his first two years of college witht p tests ?"
10508,"wow , i did not know that , he must have been realy smart . then became the 1 pick for your chiefs !"
10509,"i do n't recall that . i do now we have a great young qb in mahomes . he 's not lef6thadned like kellan moor e , the only lefty in the nfl ."
10510,"gore sure , he is a star in hte making . kellen moore knots o much lol . my favorite lefty spasm michael vick !"
10511,"oh , yeah . i live in atl howe the was happening . i ca n't believe an nfl qb would quit footbal tv go into video gaming , baker mayfield , ."
10512,"right , i think he thought about quitting the sport to video game . i would have beat him in halo 3 though one on the if sure !"
10513,ha . i guess there woudl be fewer injuries . i did n't know the nfl did n't have a rule against women playing .
10514,"i did n't know that either , i think my ex girlfriend could gave played . are you a fan of the saints ?"
10515,i like drew brees . i played im hs and there as a lot of standing around but only 11 minutes of gameplay ?
10516,"right , what a waste of money to go to a ga , e lol . i heard the cheerleaders for the saints have to leave anywhere when the players come , kind of sexist i think"
10517,does't seem fair . i wonder if they track the cheerleaders with chips wicket the are putting in shoulder pads ?
10518,i bet the do . they are probably made by engineers who make more money than players in their lifetime
10519,i ; man engineer and i ai n't seeing it . . . i ca n't see how soldiers in ww i could make ar audio out of razor blades and pencils ? wow .
10520,"lol , that takes pure science around that . i ca n't even get my already made radio to work !"
10521,"ha . i would just end up cutting myself . i guess they may have tuned into jupiter , there probably were n't a , t of station then ."
10522,"ha for sure em too ! i heard a adios can pick up these radio waves , that would be spooky !"
10523,i the made for life . . . canadian laws make their stations play 4 0pervne3t canadian music . do they have that much playable musi c ?
10524,"i do n't think so lo ; , the only canada music i know is biebers nd no thanks ! good chatting it you !"
10525,"i agree . i would rather listen to a website with classic radio dramas . thanks , you were great ."
10526,you too ! bye !
10527,"hello , do you like football ?"
10528,of course . who des n't right ?
10529,yeah its a popular sport . i recently found out that the nfl uses tracking chips .
10530,ya to track players nad in the footballs too
10531,"yeah pretty smart . its tracks speed , location , rotation and some other state ?"
10532,i wonder what they use the data for
10533,"i wave no clue , maybe on how they could be faster , or throw better . thats my guess ."
10534,i hope it goes towards reducing injuries leading to early retirement
10535,yeah that would be a good idea too ! football players do encounter a lot of injuries .
10536,"probably i the reason why considering average lifetime mannings , an engineer is paid higher than players"
10537,yeah thats crazy ! in the 60 's top bowlers warren more than football players lol
10538,man times sure have changed
10539,"i know right , w e dont even have to leave our homes to rent movies anymore ! its really convenient ."
10540,did you star tuning it when netflix started streaming ?
10541,i started using it when they only nailed ut dvds lol taht was awhile ago .
10542,"well going back to football , i 'm always surprised how the average game is only 11 minutes of real play"
10543,"yeah thats interesing , it takes like 3 hours just to get through tha 11 minutes lol un to watch though ."
10544,i personal sometimes enjoy watching those edited shorts of games unless i am watching it live
10545,i hear hte new orleans cheerleaders cant eat at the same restaurants as the players .
10546,"ya what an out dated and stupid rule . i mean even if they came first , they have to leave ."
10547,"yeah thats really rude . its been great talking to you , have a good one ."
10548,hello ! how are you today ?
10549,hi i am very good . how abou thou ?
10550,i 'm doing well ! are you a fan of football ?
10551,yes i love football . d you have sirius radio ?
10552,i did for a little bit but no anymore ? do you ?
10553,yes i did for a years but not anymore . did you know there is no written rule about one being in the nfl .
10554,"i did n't know tha t , i wonder if we will ever see a girl tryout ? it would be nice to see a woman quarterback ."
10555,yes i think so too but i really cant believe it hasnt happened ye t !
10556,can you believe there is only 1 minutes of live gameplay during a game '
10557,wow thats amazing . but yet the games take 3 houses ! wow
10558,i guess it 's worth it right ? haha who knows . i think the nfl has come a long way with their technology !
10559,yes they sure have hey use tracking chips and all in the helmets and shoulder pads thats wild
10560,"i think they team , the velocity of the all , speed , and location too ! i wonder what htey use the data for !"
10561,they recorder very play made on the field . ts amazing !
10562,do you have a favorite quarterback ? did you know baker mayfield almost host not to pursue hte footbal route ?
10563,no i couldnt tell you a single quarterback name . what team does he play for ?
10564,the cleveland browns . they are terrible . he maybe should have been a profesional gamer instead haha .
10565,lol that is a team youd dont really here much about . i think its cool the huddle was invented by amzing to help a deaf player .
10566,yea it was for paul hubbard ! taht man is a hall of famer so that is awesome !
10567,yes it has been good talking to you .
10568,and you as well ! have a great night !
10569,hi do you watch the nfl ?
10570,"i sure do , did you know women can play soo ?"
10571,yes as there is nor all that does no allow them if they qualify
10572,yes . did you know there is only 11 minutes of game play in a game ?
10573,yes crazy since u stalkers forever for the game to be with everything else in between
10574,wsa thik no wb engineer sake more money than nfl players over the lifetime
10575,yes but i guess they have longer careers too so maybe that is why
10576,"yeah that is actually a good point , it makes much more sense"
10577,did you hear about that rule for new orleans hcrerleaders ?
10578,yes them to being able to eat in th sesame restaurant as the players
10579,"what is up with that rule , and worst , they have to leave mid meal too"
10580,yes i is sexist and it really needs to go
10581,yes i agree . did you know they are using chips on the players now ?
10582,yes they are tracking velocity and speed adn all that stuff
10583,i wonder if there is a way to use that data to make the game safer
10584,i hope so too . do you like rap music ?
10585,somewhat . i like the old stuff from like tupac and eminem
10586,yes me too . tupac 's music is in the library of congress for cultural significance
10587,yes . rid you know eminem wanted to eb a comic book artist ?
10588,yes he seems to really like spiderman of all the superheroes
10589,yeah but he sure did well with music too
10590,i guess the nl protests have been a source of contention for more than a year now thoug hyou do n't hear a lot about it this season .
10591,"i remember hearing about it at the start of the season , watching to lee it any teams or players , including my fantasy players , would stand or sit or knee or whatever . i have kenny stills and he took part in the protest , at least at the state of the season ."
10592,it is sad to me that so many completely misunderstood wat the players are trying to do . and centers of their actions used their peaceful attempt to bring injustices to light tags a false call for patriotic awareness .
10593,it seems to me that the true purpose of the protest is lost . what is it about ? the concept of bail set pretrial ?
10594,"it covers many areas in my view . overreach by law enforcement , intro ; portion handling of blacks by teh courts an many others . i am a product of the 60s and fully understand their frustrations"
10595,"is these a specific policy change sought , own do you think rut 's too complex for anyone to hope for a clear resolution ?"
10596,"i think that they just want a complete rezssessment of tha criminal justice system . it is a situation that will not be solved by me but requires the efforts of a great any of us acting in concert . everyone ha their own views i suppose . like rap music , i absorb it bu am greatly outnumbered by fans ."
10597,"well , taht seems too nebulpus and abstract for us to expect any resolution time in the near future . and i think if that 's what they 're really after , standing for a minute before a football game is not enough to move ot alone , . i feel outnumbered too , but its ' really hard to fight for a cause without a specific goal ."
10598,"yes it is , and the problem is exaggerated along radio divides . minorities are more apt go react with distrust . i have never understood why the anthem is played before a sporting event anyway . even when i was a boy i thought that it diminishes it 's message ."
10599,"i do n't like the proposed solutions within the nfl , with nonbindingv ops and waive fines and such . it seems messy . whe lease do we sing the national anthem in uh us ? i cna only think of presidential debates . when do you think is appropriate ?"
10600,i agree that the nfl lacks appropriate leadership in this area ? . if they had taken a firm stand either way it would have had an effect on the protests . i think that the anthem should be reserved for government function only and that the pledge of alliance should be limited to those taking office .
10601,i would disagree . the anthem and the pledge are important ways we as a people build our cultural identity . it should be a source of unity in our diversity . do you think national identity and unity are important ?
10602,"i do . but is that national identity to be forced onto us by recruiting a script of words or is the retaliation of individual rights more important ? are we a country that subscribes to those rights or are w a nation of mindless followers ? sorry , i do n't mean to preach ,"
10603,"no offense taken . ideally , the lyrics and the script should reflect the rights meh kid in common . i 'm curious , which words or phrases do you think are inappropriate ? are there any that relate to the core of the protests , about bail or law enforcement disparities ?"
10604,"from the constitution : all men are created equals . that is a statement that has been solved aside too many times . minorities , the poor or disadvantage are purposely overlooked by many in our government ."
10605,agreed . but isnt that a reason to better emphasize and adverse tot king like the pledge ? ' . . . with liberty and justice for all ' . or the anthem : ' the land of the three ' .
10606,"only if those same words are believed in and gathered to by everyone , including those in power . however we have dressed from the football subject by a huge amount . do you have a favorite for the super bowl ."
10607,"hahaha . i like talking about subjects of weight more than a nonsequetnial party . i agree , and i would postulate that a better protest only be to raise the volume and put action begin ' land of the ree ' would be more educational and effective . i enjoyed , in retrospect , when brady beat the falcons z few years back ."
10608,"i would agree but i hate the pats , t zoom uhd drama an accusations . i think his year i 'm hoping for the saints ."
10609,oh i hate the too . . . brady and all . i thought it was impressive for the pats and sad for the falcons . i like many ryan and i love drew brees ! i guess i love qbs
10610,my fav is russel wilson ut i live in wa state . my friend i hard thoroughly enjoyed chatting with you . it is a great pleasure to find someone who can hear verbally with intelligence and insight . kudos to you !
10611,likewise . i enjoyed it as well . i 'm going to go watch some bowling to calm down np .
10612,haha . i ' ? ll take a walk .
10613,good deal .
10614,"huh , that 's interesting ! your thoughts ?"
10615,"hello , how are you ? did you know the nfl has no written rule against female players ; women would in fact he allowed if they met the league 's eligibility requirements ."
10616,an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay
10617,thats so weird considering an game can go for 34 hours .
10618,the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than teh average lifetime earnings o ana nfl player and an average ml player .
10619,"yeah thats so surprising ! new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in he same restaurant as any nfl player and i father are already dining at a restaurant and a nfl player comes in after , the cheerleaders are required to leave ."
10620,"kinda sexist . . . nfl uses tracking hips embedded ish players shoulder pad to record a players every move to the field . they are also located inside footballs to track : velocity , rotation , m ball speed and location ."
10621,"thats really interesting ! before he became a rapper , eminem 's true dream was to become a comic"
10622,hah a ! nothing excludes comey like eminem !
10623,in 2001 a michigan judge delivered her ruling in the form of a rap when trying as him filed against rapper eminem
10624,"korean rappers invented a hew tape of freestyle , it 's called ' compliment bottle ' ."
10625,"that makes sense . koreans have so much rules with music , they cant sing about anything negative and for awhile they had to hav songs about their country ol"
10626,seems strange that he university of iowa 's locker room for visiting football texans is completely painted pink
10627,"yeah , must be something kind of strategy ."
10628,"the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 . you got ta run the qb , right ?"
10629,thats huge score ! former partiots rb benjarvus greenellis has never fumble the football in his nfl career .
10630,espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games .
10631,good for them !
10632,same with bowlers . . . in the 1960 ' stop bowlers made twice as much as top footbal stars
10633,that 's sexism unfair o football players lol
10634,nice speaking with you
10635,hi ! do you follow football ?
10636,"sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i 'm familiar with the bi stories , butt hat is i t ."
10637,"that is about how much i knoe , just the basics , and some run trivia ."
10638,"i used to ive in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new t me , is he the quarterback ?"
10639,"yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then ."
10640,"now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as locks , bu rye transcends that stereotype ."
10641,"he really was , he was drafted s a number one pick in 200 too ."
10642,do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .
10643,"ive been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway"
10644,"i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , nad then for on , y 11 minutes of play ."
10645,"i is hard to find time or that , i dont know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis ."
10646,"i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works ."
10647,"ive done it traveling , youve got to really know te tea mandm all of the players names . it was so much harder ."
10648,"do you have a favorite now team . like i said , i lived in dc for aw chile so kind of follow them . now on northern ohio , the browns are ad difficult team to support ."
10649,"i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud ."
10650,"it coul be worse , i read about this team that lost 2200 . it would be hard to hatch to the sun ."
10651,taht would be really hard . ga tech sure did dominate that game .
10652,"they probably have some plaque in tbh locker doom t commemorate it . i hear one team paints th opponents locker room pink k , sets a little childish to me ."
10653,"it does , plus it is that kind of toxic behavior that makes simple things like colors ad ."
10654,"the money these pro players get now is huge , funny to think pro bowlers made more than footballers back in the sixties ."
10655,thats wild . i wonder wat the pay was back then ?
10656,probably not much for either of them .
10657,"yeah , nothing like it is today . way to such imo"
10658,"nice batting with you , h ave a good evening ."
10659,"hello , lets talk about football . there is a lover room at the university of iowa painted pink"
10660,that is weird . do you happen to know why that is ?
10661,"that locker room is used for visiting teams , maybe i was done to play with their mind before a game ."
10662,ha ! that could be it . they probably did to throw teh visiting team off their game ; . that makes perfect sense .
10663,back in the 1960 's football stars used to make less money then bowlers .
10664,"wow ! 12 i did n't know this but i bet that is not the case these day s , football players make way more than bowlers no w , right t ?"
10665,i would think so . the creation of teh yellow first down line won espn adn emmy
10666,that is very nice . i think this emmys as wel deserved because people could see where the actual first down was because before it was a guessing lame .
10667,"georgia tech hold the record for highest scoring game ink 1916 , they work with a score of 222"
10668,"wow ! ! ! who did they beat up that badly , do you know ?"
10669,"kids they were up against cumberland who ended the ga , e with a score of 0"
10670,"tha it too bad for them , i guess cumberland just made an appearance to the field that particular day . ha hq ! ! !"
10671,lets tale about radio next . there are radio storms so strong j jupiter tat then can be heard on am radio .
10672,tha big a very interesting . thanks . did you know that radio systems need an antenna to convert electric currents into radio waves ?
10673,"i did not , if you want ti listen to old classic radio dramas , there is a website dedicated to that ."
10674,thanked . do you happen to know he name of the website hat does this ?
10675,i o not . but in ww2 soldiers made radios out of razor blades and a pencil .
10676,wow ! ! ! i guess they were very creative in amzing radios to communicate with each other .
10677,in cananda father have a law that all radios must play at least 40 percent canadian music .
10678,i did n't know this . thanks . did you know that a radio receiver receives its input from an antenna and the it converts it into a form that is able for the consumer ?
10679,interesting . there is a weekly radio broadcast in finland that is conducted entirely in classical latin . it was nice talking to yoy today .
10680,"hi , how are you tonight ? are you interested in football ?"
10681,"hey the i do like football . if you want into a locker room and it was painted pink , would that make you play better or worse ?"
10682,it would make me angry and play harder to show the other team stat their little trick hadnt ' work . i ai n't no pacifier ! error !
10683,haha i 'm with you there . i ca n't believe the university of iowa did that to the opposing team lol . have you ever gone bowling by the way ?
10684,"i think other teams would hae adopted the same tactic i fit worked . i have gone bowling , not recently . not really my thing . how about you ?"
10685,"yeah 've one bowling enforce its ' crazy that bowlers ion the 60s made more than top footbal stars , oh how they times have changed"
10686,the bowlers were paid of an established port . pro football was just getting going . the college game was loved l but didd n't pay . so i 'm not surprised .
10687,yep i agree with you . hav you heard of the highest scoring football game ever ? it was with georgia tech and cumberland ?
10688,tha nwas a ridiculous blowout . tha game should never have been schedule . gt was too powerful .
10689,yep i agree with you . it was definitely a mismatch 3d o you ever watch football o nthe television ? i guess espn created the yellow line tha hows first downs
10690,"that yellow line seems so obvious , but i guess nobody figured out a way to do it . there are lots of graphics that could be superimposed on the field to make the game more interesting ."
10691,yep i agree with you . it 's crazy that they so an emmy for that too lol it seems so obvious
10692,"a reward for a line . next , u of iowa will fin room a pink line on the field ."
10693,haha anything is possible . what are your thought son the patriots ? do you know that one of them has never fumbled the ball ? i think he does n't play anymore though but that is still impressive
10694,how is that possible ? the guy must have a special technique . i hope that he got some kind of bonus for that eats . he 's incredible !
10695,that is incredible ! that o you think about the radio by the way ? do you ever listen to it ? i know that i always listen to youtube instead
10696,"i used to listen to the radio as a kid , not so much now . i go to youtube for that classics that i want to hear . radio is good for a commute ."
10697,"have you ever listened to the radio from jupiter ? . apparently you can pick it up on your am radio in the car , i 'll have to try that next time"
10698,"the storms on jupiter are probably better than a lot of high on the radio . like news broadcasts in latin , for instance ."
10699,haha that 's what i was thinking too . . canadian radio for that matter . you need at least 40 percent of the radio in canada to be of canadian origin . i ca n't think of any good canadian artists off the top of my head
10700,"rush , april wine , bryan adams , neil young are a few popular ones . then theres ' bieber . ham ."
10701,ok i 'll give you rush on that one haha . would you ever listen to a classic radio drama though ? theres ' a website that has a bunch of them for free
10702,"hello , are you a football fan . did you know that the visitors locker room is pink at the university of iowa ."
10703,"well i love pro ball , not so interested in college , it 's too emotional from players ."
10704,"in the 1960 's , the top bowlers earner twice as much has the top football stars ."
10705,i believe that . football was just beginning to become popular . it the two leagues had n't consolidated it might have remained at that level .
10706,"really , that is cool . georgia tech beat cumberland 222 . 0 in the highest scoring game ever ."
10707,must have not had a defensive coordinator back then . you have af favorite team ?
10708,"i like the carolina panthers , i 'm a nc man , . tom brady was either bad in hs o his coach did n't notice him . he was a backup quarterback and even though his team was having a historically bad season , he could n't get a start ."
10709,"i have had several different teams through the years ? i was an avid raiders fan until they moved to la , now i root fort he seahawks since i 'm from wa ."
10710,seahawks are cool . i am a russell wilson fan . he went to nc state the first 3 years . i went there . did you know that there is only 1 left handed quarterback in the nfl . it is kellan moore .
10711,i wonder if being lefthanded is an asset or a hinderance . i think that kenny stabler was also a selfie but that was long ago .
10712,i think i remember him . a cool act is thati he circular huddle used today is because of paul d . hubbard . he was a deaf quarterback and they started huddling that way so the defense could not see his hand signals .
10713,"i ha heard that . i wonder how he handled the snaps ? maybe just touched the center . how about alex smith , bot only a great qb he also hers smart ."
10714,70s he eas . i think he took enough ap tests in high school toe enter college as a junior .
10715,"amazing man . did you play fb in school ? i was raised in fairbanks way and the know did n't totally disappear until may 1s t , school let out mid may so it would have been a very short season ."
10716,"no , i played basketball . going back to alex smith , h e also vegan working on his master 's degree before he became the first pick in the 2005 nfl draft ."
10717,"hope he finishes it . while it might not pay as much , education is the best thing you can have ."
10718,"yes , that is true . the quarterback for the university of oklahoma , baker mayfield , considered quitting football to become a fulltime competitive gamer ."
10719,on to my son wasted to be a game coder but he ended jp being an it specialist . you have a pick for the super bowl yet ?
10720,he clash e can beat anyone at the university of okalhoam one on one in halo 3 . i never played makes like that .
10721,neither have i . if a game requires quick reflexes i 'm lost . i do alright in strategy games where i can take it it to think before i d anything .
10722,"well , thanks for the chat ."
10723,good morning ! are you planning to watch the nfl playoffs today ?
10724,"definitely bet . i am a huge eagles fan , go birds !"
10725,which quarterback do you like better for the eagles ? wentz or foles ?
10726,i like wentz but foles has the magic right now
10727,"he definitley does . hopefully the official let the players play today . i am al for protecting qbs ike foles , bu tome of hte coughing the passer calls shave been awful ."
10728,yes i agree especially for clay matthews
10729,"that 's a good point and redskins cbs , josh norman , has been very outspoken about this issue ."
10730,"il ive in dc and josh norman is dislike d , it 's a common opinion that all he does is talk and not play well"
10731,"lol . well you might be a little biased , you ca n't support both the redskins and eagles can you ?"
10732,"i only support teh eagle , busy ther redskins area the local team so we get a ton of news about the daily . its kind of like a circus lol"
10733,i bet ! i am in nebraska where college football is king . thoug i ways thinking about iowa where visiting locker rooms are painted pink !
10734,lol yes i have heard bout that . do you follow an nfl team ?
10735,"i usually root for a good game , but i think i am usually more against certain teams or coaches rather han ford one ."
10736,do you listen to alot of radio ?
10737,"i listen to some l especially talk radio . i like having my choice i guess . in canada , for example , they require almost half of the music on the radio be canadian ."
10738,"yes i read that , kind of interesting"
10739,i am probably more interested in all the innovation ike world war ii soldiers were able to construct a working radio with just a pencil and switchblade .
10740,"yes that is amazing , was also shocked when i read that"
10741,i guess i find all of it fascinating . how did someone figure off that these waves could be converted into sound ?
10742,"i know its crazy , i wonder if it was one of those i have an idea moments"
10743,have a great day an good luck to the eagles .
10744,do you liek to watch football ?
10745,hello i love t watch footbal l ? . what about you ?
10746,"yeah , i like it a lot . did you know university of iowa 's locker room is pink ?"
10747,that is pretty intersting . i wonder how well that works out for the opposing team and if it has no effect ;
10748,"i 'm not sure . i do n't think it would bother me , if anything it woul be an impetus to beat the other team bad ."
10749,i agree . did you know ella more is the only left handed qb in the nfl ?
10750,"i did know that , but i 'm unsure why he is the only one ."
10751,the superbowl winning qb brad johnson is the only qb in nfl history to throw a touchdown pass to himself .
10752,do you know what year that this occurred in ?
10753,i do not unfortunately . i did see that only two africanamerican qb 's have won the superbowl doug williams and russell wilson .
10754,"i remember doug williams , 420 crushing defeat of the broncos . greatest superbowl ever ."
10755,thats a huge defeat . i remember tat one too .
10756,that was the game where i think there were like 5 touchdowns in one quarter .
10757,i believe so . russel wilson is actually still under a major league baseball contract .
10758,interesting . i'n off familiar with him . is he any good ?
10759,he is very good . dod you know snoop dogg wrote a fight song fo hs son 's high school football team ?
10760,"no , i didnt . did he release it ? have you heard it ?"
10761,i have not heard it . i saw the highest paid across all u sdeparmtent of defense employees are the three football coaches for the service branches .
10762,"really ? so that would have to b army , navy , and airfare ?"
10763,"yep , which is pretty amazing e makes the most money of all government employees ."
10764,that 's a pretty interesting fact . well it was nice chatting with you ?
10765,are you a fan of sports ?
10766,"i am , i 'm a big football fan ."
10767,waht your favorite team of all times ?
10768,"the buffalo bills are my favorite team , ut i like watching others ."
10769,di doyou have try chance to watch the superbowl this year ?
10770,"i did , the patriots did a good job . tom brady ha game a long way from his jv days at junipero serra high school . he was n't even a starter back then ."
10771,tom brady is undeniable one of the greatest quarterbacks she league has had i recent times i wish the game would have been more exciting though
10772,yeah it was pretty boring . atleast it was n't a complete blow out like georgia tech di to cumberland in 1916 . they won 2220 !
10773,imagine watching that . would have left after the first four hen it hit 700 i woul stand up and get the car started lol
10774,"yeh , that 's a of scoring . i bet the quarterback di alot of work in that game ."
10775,they probably had every p ; air on the team be quarterback at least for one guy
10776,they probably did . did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback ?
10777,well heated deaf quarterback changed history because his technique is still used in modern times
10778,yeah he did . alex smith is another smart quarterback . he entered college as a junior because he took so may p test in high school .
10779,i actually never knew thay with a strong mind like that he was probably really good at making plays
10780,he probably is . i takes a strong mind as well as a strong arm to be a good quarterback .
10781,a mind like john madden and an arm like peyton manning
10782,that ' might ! i heard that baker mayfield almost quit footbal to pursue fulltime competitive game .
10783,hopefully he could become awesome at gaming so he could show he is multi talented
10784,he does csi he cold beat anyone at oklahoma at halo 3 .
10785,"i was such ah huge ana of thee halo games when they came out on xbox , cal , of duty ever did t for me when it became popular"
10786,"i really like the original halo , i even had the halo edition xbox ."
10787,"halo banged everything i used to love playng only shogun and swords , hasve an awesome day my friend"
10788,"hi there , are you a an of footbal ?"
10789,i did not follow football much . you ?
10790,"a little bit . i 'm always impressed by a good quarterback , though ."
10791,"yes , that is teh toughest position . he touches the ball on every play . it must be tough . especially the physical punishment ."
10792,"not only that , but they 're pretty such seen as the leader of the hole offensive team ."
10793,i guess the coach has to choose the rbg carefully . a player that understands what the coach is trying to achieve . who is your favorite qb ?
10794,"i do n't have a favorite , but i really do n't like tom brady . even though he 's supposedly pretty good ."
10795,"h is good , but i probably would like to see some other qbs get to win the sb . i usually root for the underdog ."
10796,"yeah , he 's definitely been to his fair share pf super bow , s . he must plan his february around it !"
10797,"yeah , dont plan a vacation in february ! he has to defend that crown . do you listen to the radio ?"
10798,i do . i like to listen to npr on th sway to work . can you believe soldiers figured out how go make ' foxhole radios ' back during ww2 ?
10799,i wonder how they did that . who taught them ? did they know beforehand ? what did they listen to ? the news in in ? lol
10800,who knows . they just used ar razorblade ad a pencil !
10801,that is amazing ! i guess they were able to get instructions or listen to the enemy . maybe they listened to storms on jupiter ?
10802,"if they were in canada , the probability of them listening to a canadian artist would be pretty high ."
10803,"yeh , theyd would ne stuck listening to rush . cant be helped ! ol would you listen to old radio dramas ?"
10804,"maybe , but i 'd prefer to listen to sports trivia . did you know the former patriots running back never fumbled the ball in his entire career ?"
10805,that is amazing ! i wonder if he got a bonus for that . that is quite a feat .
10806,"who know s ? but i should probably crap up this conversation . thanks for the chat about football and the radio ! next time to see a huddle , thank paul hubbard for that !"
10807,"paul hubbard was a legend , an innovator ! yes , great chat !"
10808,ciao !
10809,do you keep up it football ?
10810,"no . i do n't much dare for it , though i once worked security for the superbowl in end orleans ."
10811,nice ! did you get any pics or autographs ?
10812,no . i did no it i think it 's pretty interestin that bowlers once mad more money than footballers . how about you ?
10813,i think those days are long gone . this yeas season is wrapping up and the playoffs start soon .
10814,"yep . i think i 'd rather be a competitive gamer like baker mayfield thought not , though i do n't play halo"
10815,a actually had beam him in a tourney a couple years back when he was in college
10816,really ? that must have been cool . so you play halo ? o a different game ?
10817,i play call of duty now hoping that baker will jump online someday so i can beat him again . . . lol
10818,lol . never played taht on either .
10819,did you see alex smith break his leg during the games a few weeks ago ?
10820,ouch ! no . i guess being so smart did n't keep him safe !
10821,no but at least he will have something to fall back on if he cant play again .
10822,there is taht . it 's a sport not designed for a long career
10823,i think the cuddle has to go so the game can be used up a little
10824,"i rather like the huddle , though i hear you on time ."
10825,"its not needed , it was started to help a deaf qb ."
10826,"true , but hand signal have become a part of the way players communicate , deaf like hubbard or not"
10827,how much longer do you think brady has left ?
10828,"i do n't like him , so not lime left would be my hope ."
10829,"merry x , as"
10830,hey there how are you ?
10831,hi . do you enjoy any hobbies ?
10832,yeah i am crafty but nothing other than that . . my boyfriend is a big footbal can though i did get to go to a chiefs fan ethan was pretty interesting
10833,i have a passing knowledge of football and watch it occasionally as well
10834,what teams do you like
10835,i like the new england patriots . they are like the lannisters of football
10836,lol yeah they are tom brady is one hell of a quarterback
10837,so is green ellis who has never fumbled in his entire career . talk about dependable
10838,who does he play for
10839,new england patriots as well
10840,oh cool . . . kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl
10841,it ie amazing for a quarterback to be left handed considering there are more cons than pros like other sports
10842,yeah they made the ones who call the plays in the huddles
10843,did you know huddles only were started due to a deaf quarterback who did n't want his signs to be overseas ?
10844,that is interesting the university of iowa other room for the visiting team is painted pink
10845,perhaps it is to mentally perturb the opposing team or keep them off balance ?
10846,that could be i just think it is funny
10847,"who knows ? in any case , it would be that they just wanted something that stood out"
10848,yep football history has a lot of interesting facts like espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games
10849,i understand why . and average nfl game only as a dozen or so minutes of actually gameplay so any help digestion all that action is helpful
10850,yeah . . . this last super bowl was almost embarrassing the score was so low . . the highest score ever in a game was in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220
10851,"it was a bit disappointing , especially the initial ceremony . in any case k , thanks for chatting ."
10852,hi do you like football ?
10853,i do like it . snoop dogg once route a fight song for his son 's high school team
10854,that is pretty cool . the u of iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
10855,wow i wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on the opposing team
10856,good points . the espn once won an emmy . do you know what for ?
10857,"hmm i do n't know ha t , did not know they could qualify or any of thos edwards"
10858,"yeah , well they got it for teh superimposed yellow like"
10859,"oh i see , well in that case i am happy because it has made the game much easier to watch at home"
10860,the . did you know bowlers used to make less than football players in the 60s
10861,wow interesting . nba coaches are some of the biggest paid within teh military
10862,i am not surprised . do you know who benajrvus greenellis is ?
10863,i am not sure actually . did you hear about that huge stadium in texas ?
10864,"hm not really , how big is it ? benjarvus was the only one played who never fumlbedt he ball"
10865,wow that is impressive . do you listen to the radio ?
10866,i do sometimes . did you know you can hatch jupiter 's storms on am radio
10867,wow cool . among the most popular radio acts in the 30s was a ventriloquist
10868,hmm interesting . have you ever heard o foxhole radio and hat they are ?
10869,"i do not think i have heard but hat , what is it ? there is a radio station that turns solar energy into sounds"
10870,wow cool one . have you ever listened to canadian radios ?
10871,"i have not actually , i just do not have th time i guess . back to football , kellan moore is the only half handed qb in the nfl ."
10872,"wow , i wonder if he has any advantages because of that"
10873,hey ! do you watch football ?
10874,"hi ! yes , i really enjoy watching footbal l , both collegiate and professional . do you ?"
10875,"yes , me too . i did n't know that the highest score in a football was 2220 and it happened in 1916 . it you know that ?"
10876,tht 's insane ! either the team was really good or hte other team was really good . o mayo thye ew ons strike about their pay since it seems like they do n't make a lot .
10877,it coudl be . georgia tech defeated cumberland .
10878,do you have a favorite quarterback ? i think brad johnson is one of my favorites because he 's the only one i end history to throw a touchdown pass to himself !
10879,"it 's true . he is awesome . i guess quaterback is always position , which he ; le like . it 's like the e in thee enter l ."
10880,"yeah , thy 're usually where all the attention is focused on . have you ever been to a live football game ?"
10881,"yes , only on austin , when i sas a student at utzustin . how about you ? btw , do you know that the university iowa 's locker room is pink for visiting footballs , , ?"
10882,"oh wow , i 've also attended a game at ut wore but i have never been to the high school stadium that seats 18 , 000 people an cost 60 million to build . no , i did n't know that , why do they paint it pink ?"
10883,"not some , but i guess it 's not of influence on minds . but i would google it after hit . i 'm really wondering . let 's change hope . i 've read some info about radio a found quite interesting that in canada 40 percent of music played should be canadian . i did n't know that this rule . hav you eve been in canada ?"
10884,"yeah , maybe to intimidate them perhaps . i ve never been to canada but i have band on . bucket list . how do radio stations monitor whether or ot the radio station actually upheld to thet ?"
10885,i 'm sure there is special government agency or something like this lol i honestly listen radio only . my car .
10886,"yeah , i think that 's the only time i 'm exposed to the radio though there s a radio station that translates solar activity into sound for people to listen to the sun 's music , i have yet to come across this station ."
10887,"did you know that there is a website , which contains episodes of classic radio dramas for free ? i 'm wondering to find this website ."
10888,what exactly are radio dramas ? are those considered podcasts ?
10889,"not sure . i guess it 's like theater performance , but played in radio . t was popular some dozens years go , but of courses ot in youtube ifr netflix time like no ."
10890,"oh ok , i rely on podcasts for some long commutes . i had no idea ring crosby was so popular on the radio back then , he filled more than half or the radio time in 1948 !"
10891,"really ? i did n't know . yea , radio was popular . this time . i know soldiers ink wii really appriciated when thay had an opportunity to listen radio ."
10892,"oh yeah , i bet tha nwas their only source of entertainment back then ! they even had ventriloquists on radios nd it was a very popular radio act , that 's talent !"
10893,true . ok . it was nice to meet you and chat here in this hit . game a good day !
10894,"yes , have a good day !"
10895,hey themed o you watch the nfl ? it stands for the national football league btw
10896,"i do , i follow it pretty closely , what about you ?"
10897,"if hollow it sometimes , id id watch that super bowl which i found a litle bit boring , but i do likd the patriots i 'm glad they won , that about you ;"
10898,"not a patriots fan , but yeah , the superbowl was super boring this year ."
10899,"yes i agree . i wonder if it 's because then average nfl game only has 11 minutes of gameplay to it . the rest is commercial , and referees and such"
10900,"yeah , that could be a big part o fit . they do always seem to be standing around ."
10901,yep that 's true . would you watch the nfl if it had female players ? apparently there 's np rule against it
10902,i do n't know if people want to see female players .
10903,"yeah i do n't know ! t hey woul dave to be very athletic too l oh , what i do n't like is how the new orleans saints treat their hceereladers tough , did you hear about that ?"
10904,"yeah , a lot of them actually have tat rule . the redskins do too , i know because i have a few friends who cheered for them a few years back ."
10905,"o interesting , how did the like being cheerleaders by thye way , and that 's interesting taht he redskins ave that rule too , i wonder if all the teams do"
10906,"they do n't get paid well and it is a lot of work . the sun , e is actually no fraternizing , but chris cooler , a player , at the time ended up marrying one and it created a big stink for the other cheerleaders . lol"
10907,"lol that 's funny . i can see i guess why they have that rule though . what do you think about pink locker rooms by threw ay ? apparently the university of iowa di that to the opposing team 's locker room ,"
10908,"i think it is hilarious that they do that to guest teamed , buy i'n ot so sure it bothers the other team ."
10909,"i know right . i wonder if they cock their winloss record before and after they did that , in terms of how different our would be lol o rift it maps no difference at all . i co think it 's funny o that bowlers used to make more tha football players back in the 60s"
10910,i ponder how popular bowling was way back in the day ;
10911,"yes i wonder , especially because hows ike the flintstones would use it , maybe it was super popular ? also , they did n't he things like the superimposed yellow like , i know that the espn came out with that and won an emmy , i d n't think that was back in the 60s though"
10912,theyd reserve the emmy for that . it is pretty cool . i wonder if in football players became bowlers in the 60s ?
10913,"that 's a good question , i wonder how many good football players we lost to bowlers because they would be paid more lol , what do you think about dogs by the way ? do you have one ?"
10914,i heard that dogs and elephants are the only animals hat instinctively understand pointing .
10915,"is n't that interesting question mark youd ' think that would include other animals like gorillas or dolphins or something , but apparenlty yes only dodge and elephants , i also like that google prefers dogs over cats lol htey put it int heir code of conduct , i agree with them"
10916,have you heard about the ; pictures of dell beckham doing cocaine ?
10917,"not the pictures , but the 's bee na lot of disappointment in general . people seem pretty angry ."
10918,yes cribs carter is definitely mad at him and calling him stupid .
10919,"i mean , he 's not wrong . when you are that highly paid , the highes paid receiver in history , you can forgo a few years of partying to secure a long term future ."
10920,exactly especially since it could get him kicked out of the league . your image in sports matters . i agree with carter on this one .
10921,"it does alluded to th idea that carter is trying to get him to grow p and own up to the actions , so that he might not lose that spot , that 's important . people can be sorry ."
10922,he compared beckham to lawrence taylor a famous player who battled drugs .
10923,"i feel , ike getting caught with cocaine and having a big drug and alcohol problem is weird , but maybe beckham is gaping down that path . it 's a slippery slope ."
10924,absolutely he is in line to a up to 80 million over 5 years but he needs to be more mature both during the games and off field .
10925,"it does seem liek a big boys club of letting you men not be responsible for their actions because they ' do the sports really good ' , and i am glad people ware starting to call him out for it , and willing to cut good players loose ."
10926,i agree they are role models for the kids . the nfl is a professional league andc he super bowl championship game in february gets crazy amounts of viewers .
10927,"that 's true . and the fl is doing a lot to improve it 's image dont treatment of player s , the tracking chips in the shoulders and th football probably helps lessen injuries by seeing how players actually move . so hte players need to step up to that now era ."
10928,for sure . teh game has only 11 minutes of actual gameplay but there are a lot of injuries .
10929,"most certainly . especially head ones , stemming from earlier versions of the game that were just as much liek rugby . back when there was np real protective anything ."
10930,absolutely there is a reason the lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of a nfl player their career is a lot longer .
10931,"it 's funny to think that back in the 1960s , flowers were paid more . i ca n't imagine sitting around an watching bowling being more exciting , but bowling alleys were popular ."
10932,"yeah i do love bowling though its been a while since i did it . there are ore female bowlers thouhg even though i did allowed for women fo play in th nfl , there karen ; t sony ."
10933,"i wonder if women will meet the standards ' , if they did apply . i mean , new orleans in skates cheerleaders leave a restaurant if football players are there , sexism at its finest ."
10934,"no kidding 12 so maybe new orleans wo n't have a female kicker , but other teams might . locker rooms migo tube an issue however ."
10935,"probably true , but maybe we 'll see a future been it 's not lke that , adn women are n't treated like second class people in the world of football . that would probably help the boys club ' image ."
10936,is like how the university o iowa paints the visiting teams locker room pink .
10937,"i there ! so i was reading about pokemon and i guess there are over 50 episodes . that 's about 50 a year , for 16 years straight !"
10938,are you a pokemon fan ? i have never seen the show . if our its for kids . i i t ?
10939,"i 'm not so much can , i was actually reading abou televisions , since i just recently broke mine . but my youngest brother used to love that show , so i would do the pikachu voice for him . , hte little yellow character , hat i think is most popular , ."
10940,isnt that show japanese or something ?
10941,"speaking of foreign tv , i heard that 70 's show was remade verbatim in the uk , and called ' days like these ? and was cancelled after 10 episodes . i wonder why ? did they not have the same kind of 70 's as we had here ?"
10942,why would they do something so stupid as that ? verbatim ? likd thati would fool anyone .
10943,"i 'm not sure what they where trying to do there . so i just found out that new york 's area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone . i did n't even know new york 's area code adn now i learned a fun fact ! : ,"
10944,have you eve reused a rotary phone ? very slow . the new yorkers got lucky .
10945,"yes i have used a rotary phone ! makes me feel so old , haha . but good times , for sure . oh wow , is is more if a weird fact , than a fun fact but apparently it 's impossible to separate ? phone books that simply have their pages overlapped together ! that not that i have a phone book be i 'd like to test that to make sure !"
10946,"it is a useless fact except maybe for a pro bet . i guess you could win a drink , i used a rotary phone too ."
10947,"i have a sort of useful fact about phones ! the cables carrying phone and internet data across oceans are only 2 . 7 inches in diameter and just lay on the ocean floor ! that does't sound very reliable , but seems tp blew orkkgn ."
10948,i think that it is probably pretty study . plus it is way down on the bottom of the sea . nothing lives there except maybe tiny creatures .
10949,"hm , another probably notsointeresting fact , an iphone has for computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent . do you have an iphone ?"
10950,no i dont . coincidentally i do have an icbm deterrent .
10951,"haha ! i do n't have an iphone either . too expensive for my the , or wallet , !"
10952,"too expensive . the icbm deterrent has text messaging , w with is good enough for me ."
10953,"aparently , unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child n need for every minute you d n't use your cell phone i hm , i wonder what heir aim is there . nd i wonder why they do n't just donate every child i need , clean drinking water . or simply what is gon gon there ? !"
10954,raising awareness si guess . its not just the problem and the solution but getting people to think about others around the planet . and how much time they spend on those phones .
10955,"yeah , i see your point . i usually keep my phone turned off , which enders it pretty useless most of the time . but it feels good to me ! plus i 'm sick of all those spam calls or whatever the kids are calling them ."
10956,"yeah , i guess those all the time . irritating . anyway , great chat !"
10957,"yeah , it was great chatting with ya !"
10958,do you like football ? '
10959,i lie the nfl k but i think 16 games is not enough to build rivalries .
10960,"yes , i completely agree ! what do you think would be a good number of games for an nfl team to play in a season ?"
10961,"i do n't know , there are 32 teams , so a least 32 games so they have played against each other . least once before the playoffs ."
10962,"i think that would be a bit much , you would n't have any players left because of all the injuries ."
10963,"its i quite a rough sport , m ay it they had 2 rooster , but i do n't see teh point tofu having 2d ifferetn lineup for 1 team in bust make 2 different trams ."
10964,exactly ! did you know that the is only 11 minutes of live gameplay in a game ?
10965,"yeah , i think you and really good commentators with good replays to fill the rest . that why i prefer watching other things on tv ."
10966,oh yeah . . . waht outer things do you watch on television ?
10967,"i likes funny cartoons like ' the simpsons ' , but i never saw it episode where bart never appears or is referenced ."
10968,oh i love the simpsons . . . yeah i wonder what episode that is ?
10969,"wih i knew . . but there re also really boring stuff on tv , like th uk remake of 70s show that only had 10 episodes , t ms have been dreadful ."
10970,yeah . . . well the us sense of humor isp different than ours . watch teh uk version of ' the office ' and you will see
10971,"did you liked i t ? som foreign shows have success in the states , like pokemon , they have over 750 episodes . ,"
10972,"it 's ok , not a big fan of the office . that 's a lot of episodes . where do they find the time ?"
10973,i think i is more a standardized system like how the built ar than an artistic proceeds fueled by inspiration . dp you like south park ? they produce a lot of episodes too .
10974,south park is really funny ! did you se 'the simpsons crew sent the south park crew flowers on the line episode of family guy !
10975,"yeah , they criticized their humor as totally random and could be done by manatees . it was somewhat justified , but i also like this kind of humor ."
10976,never really watched family guy ! you ever seen thomas the tank ?
10977,"i saw it rom time to time when i scan the channels , i did not know that they hired stars , like ringo stars , to narrate it ."
10978,great chatting with you !
10979,hi there . i think our phones are taken fo granted . back in the day they did n't even have wireless phones .
10980,have you ever used a rotary phone ? i have . i am very old . two days older than dirt . lol
10981,yes i have ! kid of slow but not for newt yorkers who sad the most efficient area code !
10982,"yeah , the new yorkers got lucky . i bet folks in alaska adn hawaii got the low ones ."
10983,yeah good guess ! did you know teh iphone has more computing power then the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent ?
10984,"yes , and the iphone is much better at text messaging too ."
10985,yes it is . much better than the old rotary phones . unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child in nee for every minute eyou does't use your phone wb ut i 'm not sure how to enroll i this program .
10986,"neither am i . i figure that there is a web site , bur people really are addicted to their phones . i wonder how much water gets donated ."
10987,yes people really are . hopefully a lot of water . the cables carrying phone and internet data across oceans are only 2 . 7 inches in diameter . that is hard to believe .
10988,i think it is a bundle of fiberoptic cables . each thread carries a ton of signals . i wonder how they fix it when there is a problem .
10989,yes i would not want to be the electrical engineer on duty . they simply judit lay across the ocean floor .
10990,"i guess they have to send down a probe , or something like ethan . probably not a lot of life dont there though ."
10991,yeah what 's probably a good guess . apparently it is impossible to separate two phonebooks that simply have their pages overlapped together . i do n't plan on trying .
10992,phone books ? does anyone have those things any more ? do you watch tv these days ?
10993,i definitely do n't . i enjoy t vp i ca n't believe tv only used to be available in blackandwhite .
10994,"yes , that was the tv i had many years ago . you get used to it . of course , color is much better ."
10995,yes and now they even have 3d television . i use do watch throats the that engine . did you know that celebrities narrate that show ?
10996,i have never seen the show . i know tha kids love it . who has been on it ?
10997,"some celebrity narrators have been ringo starr , george carlin , and alec baldwin . they did at least 52 episodes each ."
10998,"that is great of them to lend their talent stop the shop . i shoud check it out . anyway , great chat !"
10999,i wish they never remade tha 70s show in the uk . great chatting wih you as well hope you have a great day .
11000,"hi ! do you know where to go on unicef 's site to sign up for her program that donates a day of clean water , for every minute you do n't use your cell phone ?"
11001,i do not never heard of it ! did you know a cell phone has a much computing power as a nuclear icbm deterrent ?
11002,is n't that crazy ? almost as crazy a the thought that it is impossible to separate two phonebooks whose pages have overlapped .
11003,yeah or that the cables carrying phone and internet data are under water thing on the oceans floor .
11004,"are you a simpsons fan ? there is only one episode where bart is not present , or even mentioned ."
11005,that 's strange and i did watch the simpsons for a long time . i think woman should have there own league like the wnba .
11006,in shih sport are you referring to ?
11007,"sorry i 'm referring to women in the am . i do not want to see a line backer tackling a does , that 's just me ."
11008,"many school have girls on theur hitch school teams , usually as kickers . i 'm more concerned about the saints treatment of their cheerleaders , such arctic practices ."
11009,yes very sexist there are better ways to avoid employee fraternization . strange to me that 11 minutes of live play through is all we get in a game .
11010,"i do n't watch a lot of football . however , o have seen every episode of thomas the train , that alec baldwin ahs narrated ."
11011,have you seen boy of the episodes that ringo starr or george carlin did ?
11012,i saw a few of them . george carlin was amazing . they each did at least the episodes .
11013,oh ok i think george carlin is to funny ! did you watch he 70 's show ?
11014,"i did . still do , on netflix . ia m curious as to how the british version compares ."
11015,probably much like everything else . lol . that 70 's show was canceled after 10 episodes .
11016,"i read somewhere that the producers of south park received flowers from the simpsons crew , after their family guy episode ."
11017,yeah that was either funny or very nice maybe both . do you know ow many teams the nfl has ?
11018,i do not know . 9 know tha espn wo a emmy for their superimposed yellow line .
11019,i love that line . here are 32 teams currently and 17 regular weeks with one bye week .
11020,interestin . thank you for chatting with e . enjoy your day .
11021,you as well .
11022,do you watch he nfl ?
11023,i do . did you know women scan play too ?
11024,yes there is no rule against them as long s they qualify
11025,"yeah . the game only lasts for 1 minutes , active game at least"
11026,yes . did you know engineers make more money on theirs lifetime though ?
11027,yes but they also ave longer careers than the football players
11028,"true , good point . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?"
11029,yes they can not eat in the same place as the players
11030,yes and they also have to leave mid meal if they walk in
11031,yes it is absurd ana sexist and it needs to go
11032,i agree . the are using tracking chips on the players now
11033,yes they are collecting stuff like velocity and rotation and such
11034,ya . do you knw much about the presidents ?
11035,some stuff . do you know who the three wealthiest ones in the u spare ?
11036,"the it is jefferson , washington and jfk"
11037,yeah . do you know what the first president of zimbabwe was called ?
11038,yes he was called presidnet banana
11039,yes . did you know he white house is smaller than the guest house ?
11040,cool . do you know ow teh vp used to be elected ?
11041,yes the runner up . do you use facebook ?
11042,yes . did you know they offered myspace to but it and they turned it down
11043,yesh for 75 million theyd our have made billions now
11044,what do you think about the miami dolphins ? seem are boycotting them due to continued demonstrations against police brutality and social injustices during the national anthem .
11045,"i do n't know much about that . i do n't watch a lot of football , do you ?"
11046,i only know that i read . police unions are hurting memebers in south florida to boycott
11047,"that sounds dramatic . i think the players are trying to say it has nothing to do with it supporting the military , which is why the police are upset ."
11048,there is n't an official policy agreed upon by the nfl an players association . sounds like a difficult situation .
11049,"i agree . the super bowl is coming ups do , so there is a lot of attention on the nfl ."
11050,robber quinn shook his fist as two players on the dolphins took a knee in the season opener . some people felt it was a slap in th face to military past and present and to law enforcement officers .
11051,i cans i that . did you know ah nfl gmail only has about 11 minutes of actual playing tim ?
11052,"interesting fact ! nfl players make a lot of money , but on average working as an engineer can have payoffs greater than the lifetime average earnings of an nfl or mlb player"
11053,i find that hard to believe . apparently there are no rules against omen in the nfl !
11054,i guess not everyone makes it big . i hope a lady makes it big someday . it can be difficult with gender roles especially when on the nfl since tea cheerleaders must leave a restaurant if another nfl player walks into the restaurant hey are in .
11055,that 's ridiculous ! i see a lot of sports posts on facebook . i ca n't believe the site is 15 years old parady !
11056,if myspace had been shot they would have bough facebook for 75 illion that they were offered in 2005 !
11057,seriously ! it was worth 104 billion by 2012 !
11058,"speaking o facebook , you better not press the ' like ' button in the german state of schleswigholstein because it is illegal ."
11059,that 's too funny ! yes iceland is using it or rewrite their constitution !
11060,hard to believe . i do n't think that would work for the us
11061,theres ' no way . i did n't realize you only have to be 13 to have an account
11062,"yes , and if you want a free whopper , look out for more promotions from burger king . hey had a promotion where if you unfriend 10 people on facebook , you get a free whopper ."
11063,i bet that gave them a lot of advertising attention q
11064,"one possible other way to get rich would eb if you got an inheritance from the three wealthiest presidents : jfk , washington , and jefferson ! well nice talking to you ."
11065,what do you think about the nfl controversy bout kneeling during the national anthem ?
11066,i do n't kno a part of me says its disrespectful and part of me says its free speech . people with religious beliefs who are n't allowed to stand are allowed to sit without comment after all .
11067,i found it interestin that trump decided to get involved in it . ;
11068,oh nothing is too small nad insignificant for him to comment on . did you see his tweet cat had a video of him singing the green acres tv show song ? that was wednesday of this new !
11069,"trump railed bout the peaceful demonstrations , and other people commented too , including the broward county police benevolent association ."
11070,"yes , there 's a huge difference between the president of the us commenting and the police association . trump may want attention ."
11071,"some organizations such as the dolphins are requiring their players to stand , or at least that 's what the nba said in af facebook post ."
11072,i do n't think they can legally o that . one small blessing is that trump does not post on facebook and limits himself to twitter . did you know in germany the fb 'like ' button is illegal ?
11073,i wonder how they enforce that . is it not present or it is illegal in click it ? facebook has bee around for 14 years now . its hard to remember life without it .
11074,i 'm not a prolific user of fb . i use it to connect to other fiber artists only . i could life without it . i am assuming in th german state it 's illegal in it 's absent . did you kno wb is primarily blue because zuckerburg has redgreen colorblindness ?
11075,"a few years ago it was valued at 104 billion , so i think lots of people out there use it . 8 did notice it was very blue ."
11076,lots and lots of people use it although right now tey are losing people due to the fact they disclosed persona information and lies apt doing it . stock price is down .
11077,"it is being used though . currently island is letting the public make suggestions via facebook to rewrite their constitution , so it is a tool of governments ."
11078,i think it is a good platform for hat by the way .
11079,not everyone does though . burger king had a promotions that you got a free whopper if you unfriend 10 people . i wonder what inspired that .
11080,i think that burger king was just looking for media attention which they got .
11081,i imagine that myspace regrets turning down and offer to buy facebook for 75 million .
11082,i do n't even think myspace exists anymore does it ?
11083,"i but sure , but in 2005 they coul have bought facebook . i think they would be more relevant if they had taken them up on the offer ."
11084,"oh , for sure ."
11085,"now almost everyone i know who is 13 years older , and a few who lie about it , are on facebook ."
11086,"really . i know a few people who are on it for sharing gmail and personal stuff and then more who like me use it as platform for a interest , but that 's it in my life . nice chatting with you ."
11087,"hello , just watched my favorite nfl team , the ravens , get eliminates for the playoffs ."
11088,"could n't have happened to a better team , lol . i live in baker mayfield territory . do the ravens have te same werid rules s the saints , stat prohibits its cheerleaders from eating at the same restaurant as the players ?"
11089,i thin so . similar thet if an nfl player comes in the cheerleader has to leave .
11090,that 's an asian rule . are there any female nl players yet ?
11091,"no , not a my knowledge . but there is no rule preventing them if they meet the eligibility requirements ."
11092,"i was curious if there were , as many high schools have girls on the team . with all of hte pays , it 's no wonder that viewers are only gettin 11 minutes of live gameplay ."
11093,"yeah , that is an interesting fact . i thought it was also interesting that the nfl has tracking chips in the players shoulder pads ."
11094,along with acting chips in the ball . to think there is that much research and devepllpmetn being spendy on sports is a little nauseating .
11095,lots of money involved in the sport . the first sunday in february is coming soon for the superbowl .
11096,"i wo n't be watching , as there will e documentaries on the history of the presidents . i hope they show the inside of the presidential guest house , it 's larger than the white house ."
11097,i wounder if the vice president ever stays in that house . until 1805 the vice president was he runner up in the election .
11098,"i think we should o back ot hat system , maybe then there would be less fighting . no , store is a vice president 's mansion . it 's nice do . i 'm still surprise that jfk is the richest president . i would have thought the bush family was wealthier ."
11099,i would have well . i guess jfk had gigs hands in everything . a atleast he was n't called the president banana like the president of zimbabwe
11100,"that 's hilarious , i wonder if it as a mix up in the translation ? i think it 's cool tht the indonesian president is a recording artist . i 'm going to look on youtube and see if he 's there ."
11101,"or you could check on facebook which nwas launched on february 4 , 2004 ."
11102,i still cant reliever hat myspace turned down the offer to buy facebook . maybe they would n't have had all of these problems if they woudl have bought it .
11103,maybe . mark zuckerberg is a smart gut though . his did graduate from harvard .
11104,"iceland is rewriting their constitution , and allowing the public to make suggestions via facebook . i da n't see that working here ."
11105,"no , me neither , especially with th recent facebook backlash . burger king will even give af ree whopper if you unfriend 10 people ."
11106,"i 'm not on facebook to take advantage of that promotion . i do n't like ball of the ads , i know that 's how it makes most pf is 's money , but still ."
11107,agreed . it 's been a pleasure chattin i you .
11108,you as well . have a wonderful day .
11109,"hello , do you watch football ? i read there is a running back do used to play for the patriots then nerve fumble ! that is crazy ! this guy should be more popular , i never heard of him , benjarvus green ellis ."
11110,"watching the eagles now ! ho ; et hey win : , if they win with a score of 2220 or higher , they 'll beat teh record for e highest scoring football game over the old record of georgia tech in 1916"
11111,"i saw that somewhere , amazing ! good job georgia tech ! i can ; t believe bowlers use to make twice as much a footbal players in the sixties ! that insane , bowling must have been super popular at that time !"
11112,that i crazy . do you ever see the yellow line ? espn created it
11113,yeah and won an award for it .
11114,do you like baseball ? a married couple scheduled all the games up until 2005 . in fact they scheduled 2430 games .
11115,that is a lot of time dedicated to baseball lol i hope they got paid ! it is nice when couples hav can hobby that they are so passionate about though .
11116,"sure is ! if you like to watch football as a couple , then you really only need 11 minutes to watch lie gameplay . bu t , you probably spend a few hours ."
11117,lol but you have to spend like 3 hours to watch that 11 minutes of gameplay though . . . .
11118,yep that 's exactly what i said . did you hear about the man who found lots of 1900 ' baseball cards in his grandfathers attic ; they were hidden since 1940 ' use do you know how much they were worth ?
11119,"not really , you said you only need 11 min to watch the replay . that was confusing . yeah i read about that , i thin , nwas 3 billion . or around there ."
11120,"3 million i fact . thats a lit of cash ! i you are a cheerleader for the new orleans saints , you have to leave epa restaurant if an nfl player comes in after you . that stinks ."
11121,"that seems really rude . but i ge tit , they are n't suppose to interact with football players . i think they have a crappy job thoug h , they have to pay fort heir own travel expenses an no they have tp leave a restaurant if a football payer comes in , what if they are not done eating . sad ."
11122,they should get reimburse by the nfl for teh meal then or have the nfl player pay for it .
11123,they should ! but who knows . i just learned hat women can play in the nfl ! i did n't know that before
11124,"tenure is no rule against it . i never though they could n't . i just did n't think anyone made it that far that wash female . probably there have been more than a share of obstacles to get there . nice thing i start if you are an engineer , chances are you will make more average lifetime earnings than that of the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player or mlb player"
11125,that 's great for the engineer ! seems a little weird though because football players risk they health and safety all the time .
11126,it is a very dangerous sport . did you hear tim tebow switched from the nfl to mlb but did n't fare so well getting moved to the mets ' minor leagues
11127,"no i actually did n't hear that , but i do not keep up with football much . he probably thought that since he was already a pro athlete he would be pro in mlb as well , but everyone has to start from the bottom ."
11128,"tebow ad been a heisman trophy winner i the nfl , so h dvd have a lot of pairs success in the majors ."
11129,yes . well its been nice chatting .
11130,i thought tim tebow played football .
11131,i am pretty sure he did . but with 32 nfl teams it is hard o keep up with who is on what team .
11132,"oh , i see . tim is moving from nfl to mlb . looks liek it might no too though . he cna not hit grapefruit league pitching ."
11133,oh i do n't know why players do that ! i 'd rather e nfl seeing that an average game only as about 11 minutes of actual live game play .
11134,"it think standing in hte outfield end dreaming about giant paychecks would be just a good . tim tebow is injured , he stopped on a sprinkled head ."
11135,"oh , okay . that makes sense ."
11136,tim is 30 years old . that is near the end of creed for either slave . i hope he is happy trying for ml career .
11137,"ish the so ! baseball is a good sport too , so maybe it will work out . do you know the mlb managers wear uniforms ?"
11138,they can take the field if needed . i have never seen any manager on the field other than to yell at an my though .
11139,"yes , k i can not iamgien , but i have to think it would be entertaining to see . funny that in japan baseball fans are surprised to find out the sport is america 's favorite past time ."
11140,"yes , managers , the field would be funny . it is said that the team with the most run sat the end of the game is the winner ."
11141,"yep , so i guess it does not matter ho is running . in canada kickball is called soccer baseball . i guess they must consider the foot the bat ?"
11142,"i hope the play with a red playground ball . like we had in grade school . it would be neat to have another team added to most games . offense , defense and spoilers . they would run around and cause mayhem dont he field ."
11143,"it would be good i 'm sure . instead of east , west and central divisions . can you imagine the competitiveness it could elicit ?"
11144,"kickball is called soccerbaseball in canada , they do ahve australian rules football . funny how names change but the basic idea of the game is what is important ."
11145,"yes , it is . speaking of sports nad rules , did you know then fl has no rules against female players so long as they can beet league requirements ?"
11146,yes . i had a thought though . would you call want to see a girl play center . if they are hurt on he field i would feel bad . not what i was t .
11147,not in my opinion . i am surprised they nes have the rule ! i think a girl could really be in manager in a footbal lame against men . it is better than the sexist rule the saints have in regard to their cheerleaders .
11148,those rules are terrible . its like a rule from a bone era . you would think the nfl would be modern and up to date with hiring practices .
11149,can you even imagine ws a female cheerleader that you have to get up and leave midmeal at a restaurant if any nfl player comes in because you ca n't eat at he same place as a nfl player ? insane !
11150,"it is sa ba drake . well , i am going to study an become an engineer . late on ."
11151,waht do you think about the controversy about the name of the redskins ?
11152,the issue has been around several decades .
11153,do n't the polls show that tha 'the natives are not offended but the name .
11154,native american soo not take that in negative .
11155,"but at the same time , the cleveland indians have changed their mascot because it was offending ."
11156,cleveland decision should finally complex the washington football team to make honorable decision .
11157,"you are right , besides that want do you think of football ? i think it is too slow , there is only 11 minutes of game , ay i na match ,"
11158,its need very hardwork and practice . make the nation pride .
11159,what do you think of women playing in the nfl ? there is no rule against i t .
11160,trey are have equal oppurtunity . we are living in hte it century .
11161,"yet if there is a saints player enters a restaurant , any cheerleaders already present have to leave it ."
11162,"yes , to green fraternization . it 's better to avoid cheerleaders ."
11163,"but should the player just leave the restaurant , that puts the player , male , above thee cheerleader , female , ?"
11164,cheerleaders seem to distract players . it ? s best to avoid it
11165,do n't you see this as a little sexist ar one that only 7 echeerlewdersh 've to abide for ?
11166,i think it 's best no who have players distracted .
11167,"i have difficulties understand your point . but football was not as popular as today in the 60s , then bowlers made 2x as much as footballer s ."
11168,"sorry , in the twentieth century , there were several various kinds of football which grew to most popular team ."
11169,"oh that is interesting , like soccerbaseball in canada which is kickball in the 7s ."
11170,"yes , baseball is so popular in japan also many fans are surprised to discover its status as america 's national pastime ."
11171,"baseball is quite popular , baseball players cards can be worth a fortune . have a nice christmas ."
11172,hello how are you today ?
11173,hey k i 'm doing good . how are you ? do you watch any sport like football or baseball ?
11174,"i 'm doing good too . glad it 's friday . i watch both baseball and football , . what about you ?"
11175,"me too , nut i guess in my childhood and collie years i was watching much often . i did n't know that 14 of the world 's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams . did you know that ?"
11176,i did not know that . the university of iowa 's lock room for visiting teams is painted i fall pink .
11177,lol why ? do the believe it may bring any benefits to iowa ?
11178,haha i guess . t ehigehst score ever in a football game was 2220 !
11179,when was ot ?
11180,it says it was in 1916 between georgia tech and cumberland . gt won taht game .
11181,"such score is difficult to imagine in 2019 , i get it would be impossible !"
11182,k agree . i saw that espn won an emmy for the yellow line representing the down line on american football games .
11183,"i 've heard about it . i did know that the in school stadium in allen , texas seats 18 , 000 people in cost 60 million . i 'd like to see this stadium"
11184,wow that 's crazy !
11185,do you like snoop dogg ?
11186,i do . what about you ?
11187,"yes , i like him . he wrote a fight song for his don 's high school football team . i 've never herd about it ."
11188,o how that 's pretty do . i think i heard is son is pretty good at football .
11189,i did n't know that . do you have favorite team in nfl ?
11190,"mine is the cincinnati bengals , s . that bout you ?"
11191,people in my family support differnt teams . so when i was growing up i knew that it ' z bad idea to support an team lol anyway what i don ? t like is short season in one . how long it is ? 17 weeks regular season ?
11192,good taking to you !
11193,"hi , how are you ?"
11194,goes . thanks for asking . did you watch the superbowl this past weekend ? i as on the first sunday in february right on schedule .
11195,i did watch it . did you ?
11196,"yup , but was n't very impressed with the game or the commercials . the spectacle was good though . the nfl has come a long way since playing it 's first name in 1932 on an 80 yard long dirt field ."
11197,yes it has . in fact hey went river 1b in sponsorship for th first time ever ! they 're huge !
11198,"they sure stepped away from papal johns though . between him usig the n word and spying that protesting nfl players were hurting his business , they had enough of hi m ."
11199,yeh . he 's not in their commercials anymore . . . not smart !
11200,"i know . he founded that company 30 years ago , and just ike that he out . way to really screw things up . . ."
11201,"if he says that he a conference call , imagine what he would say in private . it puts them university of louisville in a tough spot because he paid a ton for his name to be on those buildings ."
11202,htey 'll probably ride it out ; what he was as horrible and inappropriate .
11203,i guess i am questioning his decision making as he was on a conference call trying to make them a better speaker and he 's being racist . . .
11204,agreed . ca n't dispute that at all . i believe he is still owns a substantial portion of the company and will stand to profit when te company and its stock prices found . i wonder f he bought more stock when the price crashed .
11205,possibly . it shocks me that these ceos can be that brilliant o start these huge companies a not be a decent human .
11206,"i supposed greed get in the way . they start out with noble intentions , and inevitably blom wit . and the bigger the womp ; any gets , the one lives they impact when their franchise owners and workers have to feel the repercussions as well . the re left to look at his age that as still on all of their pizza boxes ."
11207,"well , do you like football ? i thought his comments about it were short sighted and probably driven by jerry jones ."
11208,i do enjoy football . my favorite team is the ravens .
11209,nice . im a chicago guy . you all had a nice season and found your qb . . .
11210,"assuming he can get his timing down , arm strength is fine . young bus have a pretty nice qb ourselves . id ' take him in a heartbeat . i wonder what those tracking chips embedded int h player 's shoulder pads show whine he wakes off and runs ."
11211,"i am worried about hum long team if he keeps running . he will get clobbered and out for a while , like rfk ."
11212,"yup , same with lamar jackson . of course , ws have re too , some here 's that . . . now all we need is one of those 50 , 000 1 , 100 pound american flags to unsure before every home game ."
11213,you would need to lineman to hold that ! nice chattin with you !
11214,"halo , do you watch football ? i did n't know that truths nfl could have female players ."
11215,"yes , i love football . i was wondering to myself , when will the nfl get 9th firsts female player . she 'll probably be a kicker ."
11216,"who knows , iv seen omen in the gym and those lifting competition ! anything could happen ! lol"
11217,true that . did you know the nfl uses tracking chip sin the player 's shoulder pads to track every move ?
11218,"i did read that k pretty amazing what technology has contributed to the sport . nowadays on tv , they can draw plays nad the playback dnc play forward re really clear and precise ."
11219,did you know that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay ? crazy is n't it ?
11220,that is crazy ! it takes much blogger to watch the entire event though lol like 3 hours or something .
11221,"will you be watching the superbowl , you only it 's the first sunday in february ."
11222,i am not sure just . i dont even know who is in the playoffs . it is a big event and a lot of my friends adn family will be watching it . are you doing ow hatch it '

11226,"just have faith , m maybe next season ! my team is the 49ers hahaha , i have no clue if they will do better necks season ."
11227,"i 've had faith for 25 years now , i just do n't se it happening . love the old 49ers , those guys wee tough in the old days . i did n't realize how popular baseball is in japan . some japanese people are surprised it 's america 's national pastime ."
11228,"lol yeah tha time a long time . yeah the old 49ers were great , legless . yeah i had no idea basetball was so popular i japan ."
11229,"what reaaly surprised , me to learn , was that th managers wear uniforms , because they 're considered part of the baseball team and can play in the game , but hey 're needed . tht 's wild is n't it ?"
11230,"that is wild , some managers are kinda old , you wouldnt want them to get injured or our . and they have like 20 people in the dugout m i does't know when they will ever have to use the coach lol"
11231,"it would have to be a very desperate situation , for sure for that to occur . getting back to football , do you watch handy canadian football ?"
11232,"no i dont actually , do you ?"
11233,"yes , i watch because a hometown boy my daughter graduated high school with plays in that league with hte toronto argonauts ."

11240,yeah you didn ' y miss much this year . i was an afc team didn ; t sin this year . i do n't like the patriots .
11241,i am tired of the patriots always winning . it gets old . i usually root for the underdog .
11242,yes me a swell . the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80 yard long dirt field inside chicago stadium .
11243,"that isp only . i didnt know taht the nfl was so old . only 80 yards ? well , i guess it couldnt be helped ."
11244,yes true . there was actually a rocket scientist who coached in teh i before . matt patricia !
11245,that is great ! i wonder what drew him to football . rocket science is a bit different ! lol
11246,"dyes very true . i also like baseball too . and a typical major league baseball season a total of 160 , 00 baseballs i used ."
11247,that is amazing . each team plays 162 games . i wonder how many balls per game get used .
11248,yea that is a lot of games . the chicago cubs were the first baseball team to win back to back world series . pretty cool !
11249,that is cool ! then they had a dry streak for about . . . ow long ? is it a curse ?
11250,not sure if it is a curse but it definitely would be . ar 've that i have her heard of is that if z ppl ; layer catches a baseball in their hat he opposing team receives three bases .
11251,is that true ? when did someone ever catch a all in their at ? i might have to look that rule up .
11252,yes i need to look it up to . the minrleague baseball team in albuquerque wa snake after the baseball day in the simpsons slow .
11253,that is great ! life imitate art . i wonder if they are any good . the have to live down to their namesake . lol
11254,ha ha yea definitely . well high school football is definitely more popular than high school baseball because there 's a 60 million highs school football stadium in texas .
11255,"those stadiums are basically giant temple . people go there to worship . lol i like sport s , but i thin than more money should go to education . anyway , great chat"
11256,great chatting with you too i hope you have a pleasant afternoon .
11257,goof mpon9ng ! ? you enjoy watching football ?
11258,love it ! i never miss my team 's game during the season . do you ?
11259,i watch it all the time ! who is your favorite team ? did you know hat the average gameplay of a game is 11 minutes long ?
11260,tea which makes me feel dipped haha i devote 2 plus hours to watching just for 11 minutes ! ~ i like the pats . how about you ?
11261,"i like the vikings . i wonder how long commericals re during that time . i never knew women could play , they just don ' take the steak !"
11262,do you thin kanya women have tried out for any team yet ?
11263,i doubt it . it would be good to see at some point ! do you watch baseball too ? i didnt realize managers could play took if they needed to .
11264,"i dont , i think baseball is too slow ! ! border if a manager has ever had to play in a mlb game before . that woudl be funny to see"
11265,i agree it 's too slow . japanese people are obsessed with it though in tappan .
11266,"they love it so much that nintendo actually owned the seat , e mariners for awhile"
11267,i think they stil leave a share in that team ! let 's talk more about that patriots . do you remember greenellis ? he never fumbled the ball in his nfl career .
11268,he was a great player ! it you know that yellow line you see on t visit actualy on thur field ?
11269,yes i knew that haha . they did win an emmy for that though whe they created i t .
11270,i always wondered how they move it around during the game . it is insanely useful ifr everyones o have tha on scream
11271,it really is . they have z whole team to do it i 'm sure . do you have a college football teams ?
11272,"yea but man did we suck ! only won one game when i was at the school . the rams , at too good ! how about you ?"
11273,i 'm a iowa hawkeye fan . i always enjoy people talking about how they paint the visitor 's locker room pink .
11274,do you think they do that to psyche the other team out ?
11275,oh for sure . they also have eat the children 's hospital actor the first quarter which is touching .
11276,that is nice . i heard the highest scoring game ever was a college lame . geogia tech won 222 . how embarrassing
11277,that is beyond embarrassing ! i wonder what is next in the record book !
11278,im gon na go check ! nice chatting with you
11279,raiders havent won as superbowl in a long time if at all ?
11280,i 'm not really that it football . maybe it 's because there are only abou the minutes of live gameplay per game .
11281,"yeah 1 minutes seems alike a scam , games lasts for about 3 hours and only 11 minute so gameplay , totally unfair"
11282,"haha . i wonder if anything will change for the raiders when they move to vegas . i 'm kind of sad to see the go since i 'm from that he , though i can not say 'm a fan ."
11283,"many fans must be ad , they will gain new fans on the plus side adn maybe their enough will be over , changing cities can be a good thing , the stadium must be really nice"
11284,it seems like it 's still unclear as to where the raiders will play in 319
11285,"it seems like a college stadium is a likely it for the team , it sa complicated issue , lets hop hte stadium is react quickly"
11286,"yeah , it really is a complicated matter . the city is expected to file an antitrust lawsuit over the raises ' move to las vegas ."
11287,"it seems like a long fight , that will take a lot of time to settle , hte lawsuit ahs to materialize yet so maybe they wont fine anough to dep it"
11288,"he chronicle thinks it was happen . however , the raiders probably do not golf a great hand ."
11289,"yeah it seems liek they broke an agreement , they should have thought twice before changing cities ."
11290,yeah there are a bunch of reasons why it ca n't be in the bay area or las vegas so we shall see .
11291,"yeah , so you said youre nyt really into fooball but do you have a favorite team ?"
11292,"i just like teams from the bay area , haha . neat would be the raiders and 49ers wh ow about you ?"
11293,"i see lol , well mine is in the afc , and just won the superbowl , scan you guess what team im talking about ?"
11294,"the patriots , yes they are an awesome team ! it 's interesting how much technology there is in football today . there are tracking hips in shoulder pads and footballs ."
11295,"yeah the patriots , thats my favorite team and it is interesting ! technology has advanced so much that chips can feel us all kinds of cool stats about the game"
11296,yeh . espn 's yellow line helps me out a bit . they even won an emmy for that .
11297,do you think espn reserved an emmy for that ?
11298,"haha , bot sure . it 's interesting how much americans love football now . in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ."
11299,"they did ? i dont up them making more money now a days , football players re loaded , they earn a lot of money"
11300,"yes . surprisingly though , the average engineer makes more over a lifetime and the average nfl player ."
11301,"well it takes football players only a few years hen their carreers are over , engineers word humor years overall"
11302,"hi the , do you watch the nfl ?"
11303,i used to watch before all of joe kneeling and protesting
11304,oh i see . did you know hat women can play in the nfl as well ?
11305,"yeah , i saw that . the lawyers are licking their chips on tha idea"
11306,i winder if any womens ave at least tried to qualify as other is no rule that denies them stat
11307,"i do n't think so , i havent heard of any trying out . does like it would be all over hte ' news ' if that happened ."
11308,"yeah i agree . did you hear they are in tracking chips on the players now in the field , d ?"
11309,yeah look like they are putting them in the bal ; s too . ahh technology
11310,yeh and they are tracking velocity and rotation and a bunch of other stuff too
11311,guess theyd and to know wo has the fastest spinning spiral
11312,maybe end i somehow hope they can use that dat top make the game safer too for the players
11313,i think it 's safer today . the refs or league let them get away with much more back in the day
11314,i guess so . did you hear about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders ?
11315,i did not see that one . that 's a pretty bizarre rule .
11316,"yeah it is , i just do not understand why they can not eat in the same place as the players ."
11317,something must have happened at some point that they created that rule .
11318,i guess so . the worst part about it through is that they have to leave mid meal if the walk in
11319,"yet , not sure how they got away with that he . seems pretty unfair"
11320,it sure does . did you know there are only 11 minutes of active game play in an nfl game ?
11321,yeah thats another on thay 's har do believe . seems like even th highlights of the game are longer than that
11322,"yeah exactly , i less there is a lot of downtime in there"
11323,do you follow the nfl ? a you have a favorite team ?
11324,i do ! i love the cowboys . how about you ?
11325,"i love the cowboys was well , what do you think about their current season ?"
11326,"the played pretty well is past season , i as a bummer they did n't make it far in the playoffs . you i guess it would n't be a super bowl without the patriot involved somehow ."
11327,"i hate the patriots , they are always in the superbowl and ususally wih it , it makes the league a lot less competitive , what are your thoughts on o . j simpson ?"
11328,he 's a murderer .
11329,"i agree , he got a away with turned but he was a great player i think the media had a lot o fo with hime setting away with it"
11330,"ironically , homer simpson from ' the simpsons ' had a dream of owning the cowboys . i wonder if htey wrote that in as a dog to o j ."
11331,"i think that happened in the 13th season , wonder if they made that on purpose i bet it was ,"
11332,it 's crazy to think how much money it posts tom game a football stadium
11333,"i have no idea but im guessing a lot of money , players do earn a lot"
11334,there 's a high school stadium in texas that cost 60 million to make ! just th flags used at footballs stadiums are expensive .
11335,"60 million wow , that is a lot of money for a stadium , we love to spend money on unneserary things meanwhile kids are starving"
11336,"will , it was a bunch of wealthy white men in texas who funded the project , i 'm sure . though it says something thet the three highest paid positions across all of the us dept f define are the voices of the football teams for the respective service branches ."
11337,that is really unfair so do you also like baseball or just a football fan ?
11338,"sure , i like baseball . it is america 's pasttime , after all . how about you ?"
11339,"i like it , apparently the poet is also really popular in japan"
11340,that 's cool . were you happy to see the cubs break their losing streak ac couple of years ago ?
11341,"i ws , teh more had a long curse seems like a unreal bring but they suffered for a lot of years"
11342,"yeah . the early 1900s . they were the first team o ever win back to back , then never again until 2016 . crazy ! well , it 's been nice talking to you today ."
11343,"that is crazy , i wonder how they broke the curse and its been creat talking to you as well hav epa juice day friend"
11344,maybe tube curse just had a time limit over 110 years ? haha . farewell !
11345,"hello , what are your thoughts on teh raiders , do you like football ?"
11346,"hi , i am not really a big football ca but i follow from time to ti , e . it 's going to be interesting to see where they play this year !"
11347,"i know right , wonder if they are big to play in vegas this year , maybe next"
11348,i guess it all depends on whether or not oakland files an antitrust suit . i hope they do . i am sick of all these years moving around
11349,"yeah make an example out of them , the team is letting down a whole city and thats not fair"
11350,completely agree . did you know that there were only 11 minutes of action in a nfl game ?
11351,only 11 minutes ? that seems like a scam
11352,yeah lo . definitely not getting your money 's worth h !
11353,"yeah , seems really unfair , tickets are really expensive and then all those annoying ads , i still like the game though"
11354,"yep , the game is entertaining from sure . also , there is no rule against female players . that might make it more entertaining lol"
11355,"it would , although i would have the stomach to watch that , watching a woman getting tackled by those monster trucks , a real tragedy"
11356,"it could get ugly fast . engineers make more money than nfl players , so they 'd be better off becoming engineers"
11357,"they make more money ? wow , thats probably because of the short carreers they tend to have , f football players"
11358,"agreed . i do n't know how long an average fl career is , but i would guess its just a few seasons ."
11359,"the is also the risk of injuries , taht can end a carreer fast , an most players end with financial problems so maybe not worth it"
11360,very true . the nfl does put trackers in players shoulder pads ad in the ball . hopefully that data will help the game welcome saver
11361,"seems a bit invasive if you ask me , i think placing the chips o nthe balls is a great idea , many cool stats come out of the"
11362,do you know what the highest score in a football game ever was ?
11363,"no . , dont knw about that game maybe likd 150 ?"
11364,it was 2220 . georgia tech beat cumberland back in 1916
11365,"wow that is a humiliating defeat , poor team"
11366,how ore you ; do you like the nfl ?
11367,"i do , i like watching football every sunday when its o n , do you ?"
11368,i love watching football too . did you know the nfl has no written rule against females playing ?
11369,i always wondered that ! why arent here any players you think ?
11370,i 'm not too sure on that one . the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay .
11371,did you know an average engineer will make more over his lifetime than an nfl player ?
11372,that 's pretty amazing . just got o show how short lived the average nfl career is .
11373,and how lucrative it is ok be an engineer 2
11374,very much so . i saw that the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players ' shoulder pads .
11375,rib et those were designed by hose well paid engineers ! job a good idea to track stats and position and whatnot
11376,"i bet . it says they are tracking every move on the field duo gather data on velocity , rotation , ball speed , and location"
11377,they must be pretty durable if they dont ever get crushed from all the tackling
11378,i agree . the university of iowa painted their opposing tema locker room pink .
11379,"i bet that was too psyche out the visiting time when they play against the , get into the heads before th game"
11380,i bet . i wonder how well that actually works ? i bet it does n't do too much .
11381,"it might just be for fun , like a playful joke . even if it doesnt work , its kind of funny"
11382,"i think it 's funny too . in the 1960 's , the top bowlers earned twice as dutch as the top fl stars ."
11383,"i wonder how much a bowler ca earn nowadays , you dont hear bout them very often"
11384,i bet they do n't make that much . bowling reall lost popularity ;
11385,"big time , its almost seen as a punching these days"
11386,it was a good time chatting with you .
11387,yes fo sure !
11388,i wonder why the media made such a big deal about the cowboys . perhaps you could tell me .
11389,people love their football . i think they hasve really god marketing . seems like dallas affiliated people are showing up all over tv .
11390,i would expect people would talk store about the patriot instead of the cowboys since they do superbowl games many times .
11391,"yeah , s something about that blue sugar books cooler on clothes i think . football is still big here . we have 14 of the worlds 25 largest stadiums ."
11392,nfl is very powerful . they have no competition .
11393,they 've come a long way since 1932 .
11394,it has 32 professional footballs .
11395,and squeeze all soft hem into 17 weeks with 16 games ethic .
11396,what i meant earlier was ' 32 team ' . 16 games in 1 week only ?
11397,"yeah , that 's a lot of games in a short amount of time ."
11398,"the superbowl usually runs in february . so , what do the nfl teams do in january ?"
11399,"playoffs , if they 're one of the 12 teams that make the cut ."
11400,"i see . th two teams that go to the superbowl , do they have to be from the two different conferences , nfc and afc , or the can be from nfc or afc only ?"
11401,"on from man , a champion form th nfc and the afc ."
11402,i see . thank you for the info . did you watch the last superbowl in person or on v ?
11403,i watched it . i 'm wondering what i can do to he an onair sports says . that job seems easy to me .
11404,"it is a fun job , i 'm sure . are you familiar with romo ? is he or was he an onair sports analyst ?"
11405,"yeh , he 's with one of the networks . i think aikman is on fox ."
11406,i learner da lot about nfl and football from you . our should be an analyst .
11407,thinks ! i get around k suppose . even old joe namaste got to be an analyst .
11408,i 've got to run . ice chatting with you .
11409,"football is a team sport , kicking the ball in various degrees to score a goal . sports commonly called football in certain place include association football ."
11410,i love nfl football !
11411,which is your favourite game ?
11412,raider nation here !
11413,the nfl has no written rule against female players . they are allowed to join a team if they meet the league eligibility requirements .
11414,that would be real to see .
11415,nfl uses the tracking chips to record the movement of the players in the field . each team really wants to win that trophy 2
11416,i think it helps them figure out how to prevent injury stood .
11417,"the nfl seasons runs from september to december . each team wants to play 16 games , one each week ."
11418,that is a lot of games considering there area 2 teams .
11419,yes . all the team want to win the trophy . the team with most of the championships in the nfl is the green bay packers .
11420,all this for a game with only 11 minutes of actual game play .
11421,age average lifetime earnings of an nfl player is higher than other sports ' players . all the best members want to lift the trophy .
11422,espn invested teh yellow line .
11423,baseball is america 's national pastime but it is very popular in japan also . money of the japanese love baseball .
11424,managers can actually play !
11425,sometimes . they wear the uniform if theyve technically able to play for their teams .
11426,kickball is called soccer baseball in canada .
11427,yes . the highest score in a football game occurred in october 1916 : georgia tech defeated cumberland 2220 .
11428,i would have forested by halftime if i were cumberland .
11429,the whole game was played . cumberland fans cried for the great loss .
11430,"haha , im sure . take care and have a good night ."
11431,sweet dreams . have a great day also .
11432,sweet streams
11433,in baseball the team that scores the most runs by the end of the game . the winner .
11434,": ,"
11435,are you on for a baseball or football fan ?
11436,"i actually love them both , you ?"
11437,"at my agree , i prefer to play baseball , but prefer to watch football . you ?"
11438,i do n't play either anymore haha although i 'm not that old . i like to watch football a little bit more but they run during different seasons so i can watch bot h .
11439,"you know , back in the 1960s , bowlers would make ore money than football players . now tha i a sport i can not understand why people would watch rather than play ."
11440,haha it 's rnadojly on espn every now and then . i would n't be surprised if 'the top bowlers still snake more taht some lol players .
11441,"the highest scoring football game was 2220 , which sounds more like a bowling score ! how does that happen ?"
11442,it 's got to be a very mismatched college or high school game . i ca n't imagine how frustrating it would the to be the team at scored 0
11443,"really ! a loss like that is demoralizing , but so is walking into the university of iowas 's visitors locker room , because the entire room ks painted pink !"
11444,it 's a good to mess with the other teams head . are you a fan of a particular team in either sport ?
11445,"i usually prefer afc over nfc in the superbowl because most of my favorite teams and players are afc . in baseball and college football , i prefer to wear for my local college steaks ."
11446,nit a patriots fan are you ?
11447,"begrudgingly . i grew up in the shadow of hi ; tx stadium in richard park , and the patriots were never my does . but there is no denying the successes or the brady or belichick era . you ?"
11448,haha i ca n't stand them . did you know their former rb benjarvus greenellis never fumbled once during is career ?
11449,"a noteworthy record indeed . he made it easy on the referees , since ball placement was always easy with him . that superimposed yellow alien espn got an emmy for was always put down in the right place ."
11450,"i do n't know about , but i could n't imagine watching a game without the yellow line now . well deserved emmy ."
11451,"with their new technology , like putting tracking chips in the balls , i would imagine yellow line placement might become computerized in the future . just what we need , an ai referee !"
11452,i might not hate that idea . think about how much faster the game woud be . i think about that a lo twitch baseball .
11453,faster football game ? he live gameplay is limited to about 11 minutes . how much faster do you want it to get ? lo
11454,haha well there would be less time wasted if everything was decided split second . but they seem to be putting a lot of tech into tense games to begin with !
11455,i would be in favor of shorter does if it meant less taking head time . . . most commentators not my taste . nice chatting with you !
11456,do you like to go to concerts ?
11457,yes . one of my favorite bands played 2263 concerts . the ramoenst toured almost non stop for 20 years .
11458,"the ramones re a great band , on so my favorites as well and 2263 concerts ! wow that is insane !"
11459,i know ! well it seems like linkin park was on heart way to catching up to that number . hey played 324 concerts in 2001 alone .
11460,"that is also insane , thats like 1 concert per day , i wonder how he did that"
11461,i know . i did n't realize they were that popular . unlike the band creed who played a concert so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit .
11462,"i had that concert was terrible imagine getting sued lol ,"
11463,"that must have been real ; y bad . pink lloyd would no shave had the same problem . first , they are a great band and fondly they played an ancient roman amphitheater with no audience ."
11464,"i wonder what where his reasons behind that , sounds like a great venue for a full concert , lots of money"
11465,i think they recorded it and hen shared the recording with fans but no one was there to witness them live .
11466,"still a great venue ike that ancient roman amphitheater in croatia , a place with a lot of history"
11467,taht would be so cool to see a concert there . mu humor eexcuitingt han a football game that only has 11 minutes of live game play .
11468,"11 minutes doesnt seem like a lot give , i heard a team lost 2220 once , 11 painful minutes"
11469,i agree . i always felt like sports players more too much money . i was happy to learn that the average earnings of lane engineer are more than that of an nl or mlb player .
11470,"i guess negine4rs study harder and work harder than players , both are reallly rewarding careers ."
11471,"it is also nice to know that there is no rule against female players , they just need to meet the league 's requirements ."
11472,"i wonder why no woman has played in the league then , it must be really hard to meet those requirements and also have a coach that will start you on the team"
11473,i in so . maybe as a kicker women could have got luck . although it seems unlikely when you hear a new orleans saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if a player is there .
11474,"that could work and that is a terrible rule , the nfl should ban that rule , so unfair"
11475,i agree otheeeoise football player should g back t making elses han bowlers like in the 1960s .
11476,yeah its crazy how bowlers used to make more money back in the day .
11477,are you a jets fan ?
11478,i am not . are you ?
11479,i follow wthe cowboys but i heard he other day that they offered ndamukong push a big offer to come to their team .
11480,the jets ? they must be desperate for someone to be a huge disappointment ? he 's not that good .
11481,well looks pike they figured that out and resigned the offer . i heard it was a pretty big surprise e .
11482,didn ' the sign with the ram after they reminded that ? and is n't bowlers fired ?
11483,"i had not heard , i it know that they can get did n't seem to be a keeping with their longterm plan . i ca n't believe ow much football players make these days . back in the 60 's a top bow ; er made twice as much as a football player . how times have changed ."
11484,i know . and the careers are so short . engineers often the more than the avg football player .
11485,thats rounds about right considering most players don ' play that long . i heard tat espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow first down lie . i had no idea you could win an award for that !
11486,i feel like that does not rose to hte level of emmy worthy . they put that in the same category as really important art . . .
11487,i agree . i just think t is crazy that they put tracking chips in the football and on the players gear go record everything . they are taking this to the next level for sure .
11488,"yeah . if there is money to be made , they will find a way . i hope they use it to keep th players safe and not just to sell data ."
11489,i hope so too . i ca n't believe hat most nfl games only have 11 minutes of live game play . basically it is mostly them in the huddle !
11490,yeah . it 's not against the rules for aw on to play int he blm
11491,thank goodness . just in case i woul alike to try a new career ! it would doing to be a new orleans saint cheerleader . they ca n't even eat in the same restaurant if there is a nfl player . they have to leave if one comes in . double standard .
11492,"i feel like th player souls leave nba not the cheerleader . what 's th saying , possession is n't 9 or 10 of the law . . . they 're in there , you leave !"
11493,absolutely . it is ridiculous ! i wonder if the university of iowa was thinking about the cheerleaders when they painted the locker room for the visiting team pink ? !
11494,the nfl was originally named the american professional fooball association . that does not roll off the tongue . . .
11495,not at all ! how do you feel about who won the super bowl this year ?
11496,i was fine with it . i appreciate the excellence . you ?
11497,same ! how can you on tom brady . he is crazy good ! it was nice chatting with you .
11498,"hey , i love the moon and the teammate ndamukontg such ."
11499,i am from chicago so i must hate the ones . bed down ! he eventually signed with the rams .
11500,oh nice ! i am a huge packers fan from california ! ha . ndamukong spent three years wath hte dolphins .
11501,how do you become a packers fan in california ? it is in wb blood to despise them .
11502,"i know , it 's a weird thing ! i would be a rams fan ."
11503,did you move from wisconsin ?
11504,"no , i just married q packer na adn we had pacers babies . ha ! we met t a ramones concert a long long time to . the ramones traveled a lot and dis concerts for 20 year snow stop ."
11505,i love the ramones . almost as much as i love hybrid theory !
11506,"oh yeah , me too ! the ramones played 2 , 263 concerts over the years . i saw the gogo 's open for them with the flaming hips ."
11507,"the flaming lips ? they 're that old , not tat the ramones are old but comparitively , ?"
11508,"yep , i saw the in the very beginning . they are from oklahoma city and were just a local band that was unknown ."
11509,"wo a that 's cool . i love teh ' i saw them in a bar with 20 people e 's stories ? . i have one but dave matthews but the venue had like 2 , 000 on 1993"
11510,"oh wow ! that is cool . i have never seen dave matthews . i actually patched that show at oklahoma university , ou , , the home of mayfield !"
11511,nice . he almost quit football for gaming . wokuld'veb even a poor choice .
11512,"oh man ! that is a fun fact for sure ! i had learned that the university of in 's locker room is painted pink , for the visiting teams . haha ! another poor choice ! !"
11513,"i wonder if that actually works . scientifically , have they proved i works or is it just some pink paint ?"
11514,i am pretty sure i the just used for getting under their skin . i bet it has zero proof behind the idea . did you know taht the yellow line superimposed on the tv was he creation of espn ?
11515,did n't they win an emmy for that line ? i had no idea the bar was so low for memes
11516,"ha ! i know it , it ? super low ."
11517,the game only has 11 minutes too ! the give it to something with only 11 minutes of useful life ?
11518,"yeah , totally right ! football is called soccer i a lot of places too , lol"
11519,did you kno stat new orphans saints cheerleaders can not eat in teh same restaurant as a saints player ? they have to leave the place if the player comes in .
11520,"i recently seen this somewhere , and thought was outrageous ."
11521,i think it is outrageous too because what if the cheerleader is with her family ? does that mean the cheerleader has to immediately stop eating and leave ?
11522,yeah i believe so .
11523,do you know why there are n't any female nl players ?
11524,"no , in t sure . i guess it 's because the nfl is against females playing football ."
11525,they do n't have a written rule against female players . i guess a female was ' ; r tried yet .
11526,"oh , well at least females can play , hopefully there will be one day ."
11527,"yeah , especially when the game is really only 11 minutes if uo take away all the timeouts and commercials ."
11528,"that 's pretty crazy to think about . speaking of football , apparently snoop dogg wrote a song for his son 's high school football team ."
11529,i seen snoop and his son on netflix . as how about the football team .
11530,that 's cool i did't know they are on netflix .
11531,snoop was the coach and it was pretty interesting .
11532,ll hot is so cool .
11533,his son did up quitting football .
11534,"aw , that ' lead . the stadiums in aleen , texas seats 1 8 , 000 and cost at least 60 million to build !"
11535,oh that is alot of money ! it should be able to host the super bowl by first sunday in february next year .
11536,"it ' sa high school football stadium , so i dont ' know if that is a thing or if it 's only for universities ."
11537,well all i know is the super bowl is the best of the nfc and afc and it comes down to one champ out of 32 teams .
11538,"it is true , i do enjoy watching the super bowl ."
11539,me too although it was pretty boring this year .
11540,"yeah , it was very boring ."
11541,have a great night .
11542,"hi , do you like th nfl ?"
11543,i do like the nfl . do you ?
11544,i do . my favorite team is the chicago bears . do you have a favorite ?
11545,i like the ravens ad the eagles !
11546,"both really good teams ! although they only play 11 minutes of game time , i still enjoy it ."
11547,that is crazy how short hte live game actually is . did you hear about the tracking hips in players shoulder phds ?
11548,i did read something but it . do you know anything about them that you shed some light on for me ?
11549,they redford a players every move on the field ! that is so much data .
11550,i know . i wonder what they actually do with the data . do team use it or just the only .
11551,i am not sure . i bet every sporty ill eventually have trackers like hat .
11552,"yah , maybe except baseball . that seems pretty easy to train ."
11553,true . they even have the tracking chips inside the footballs .
11554,i wonder why they still send a chain gang to measure 10 yards then . . .
11555,i am not sure . i am surprise dog they do not have it ll computerized .
11556,i get irritated when i watch tennis adn they can determine in or out in 7 seconds but th nfl runs out old guys with sticks to determine if it went 10 yards . . . seems dated .
11557,i agree . do you know when the first nfl playoff game was played ?
11558,i have no idea . when ?
11559,in 1932 on an 80 yard long dirt field .
11560,that ' sa long time ago ! and 80 yards ? were the players ou tofu shape and could only go 80 yards ?
11561,i am not sure how it worked . i who in chicago .
11562,it was probably at wrigley and that 's the longest they could make the field . ice chatting with you !
11563,hi how are you doing ? do you like cars ?
11564,"i am ok , yes i like cars a lot , i even have a huge car collection of toys cars , i was saving for years ."
11565,i dont have a car at the moment . i do like cars though . what do you think of south africa ?
11566,wow that something that it 's legal to equip car with flame throwers to prevent carjacking .
11567,i wonder how many people actually do that . it cant be cheap to do it and maybe other people would get thur .
11568,"yes you are right , i wonder jann mardenborough became a professional race car driver by beating 90 , 000 people in a video game ?"
11569,is that true ? that sounds impossible . how long would it take to play that many times ?
11570,"long time , i guess that just build him or her confident to the max , as it became almost like a real reality ."
11571,"i guess , i would still want to practice behind the wheel of the real thin for a thiel before racing ."
11572,"have you owned a car in the past , i had a sport car back i nthe days , i like that car so much , because it reminds m to a race car and it had loud pipes and lot was a shift ."
11573,"i used to have a car . its an expense that i try to avoid if i can . it was a used car , it ran , thats about it . it was automatic ."
11574,did you know that mcdonalds added a drivethru in 1975 to accommodate soldiers that very n't allow to get out of there cars while wearing fatigues .
11575,it thoygtn that the drive thru was ay older than that because he us has such a car culture . great innovation in keeping us overused and immobile . lol
11576,"yes you are right , do you watched a lot of tv when you are n't busy , do you still have some of the old black and white tv in your closet ?"
11577,no i dont . i did watch on hen i was young . painful for playing video games . now the tvs are so huge they dominate the room .
11578,"yu are rig , i do n't remember the black and white tv having any extra plugs , i think only for an antenna ."
11579,"yes , you had to attach hte video game via the antenna , tone switch to channel 3 . now it 's all computers"
11580,"yes , it all built in , the black and white tv people could n't tell what color was anything ws ome peopel place color plastic over their screen ."
11581,"taht is going back a long way ! anyway , great chat !"
11582,"there are over 750 episodes of pokemon , it was nice chatting with you also ."
11583,thanks ! good night !
11584,good tight to you also .
11585,do you watch any television shows ?
11586,i dont really watch tv these days . you ?
11587,"i do n't either , mostly sports . i did watch al ot of south park back in the day , did you ever watch that ?"
11588,"yes , il aired south park . it has been a great show . it seems to stay relevant ."
11589,"yea , they made fun of family guy once , and the simpsons creators sent them flowers for it ."
11590,"hear , i bet the simpsons liked cat . the simpsons has had trouble maintaining its quad , pity over the las they years . i think that comedy is quite difficult ."
11591,yea i stopped watching years ago . apparently in episode in the whole series did not have bart in it or mention him . i ant to watch that episode
11592,i wonder what the episode was about . that is odd . the simpsons has great voice talent .
11593,yea they do . i wonder why also . did you ever watch pokemon ?
11594,"no , i never did . i a kids show , right ?"
11595,"do , i used to love watching it . it was has 750 episode s , i do n't think i watched them all though . it was so good ."
11596,"really ? ok . i know that it is tied to toys and video games , so i wondered if it was and for adults too"
11597,"yep , and 0okmeon cards that are worths over money . how about that 70s show , ever seen that ?"
11598,"no , 8 didnt but i think it was a very popular show . probably a lot of actors launched big careers here ."
11599,"yo 're right , mostly all of them became something big after that . i wish the same was for that 70s show uk rmeakw , they only lasted 10 episodes ."
11600,"shows dont aways travel well to other cultures , and i guess a verbatim remake is flat . the casting wouldnt work either ."
11601,"no they dont ' . one show did and that was the office . so amazing . another was thomas th strain , ever see that one ?"
11602,"the office was very different in the uk i think . americans would want a different show . i never saw thomas , its for kids , yes ?"
11603,they are both on netflix so i have seen both . thomas the train was voiced over by many famous actors
11604,"ok . yes thomas probably would attract a lot of talent . it bas a classy look , if i remember right ."
11605,"for sure , they have to be good . it was s nice batting with you , take care !"
11606,good evening ! i hope you are wool ! know do you think the us would be of the runner up in th presidential rave became the vice president like it was prior to 1805 ?
11607,"hello , i dont think that would work for our current situation lol whose 2 do not get a long lol"
11608,"it would be crazy that is for sure ! maybe our next elections an feature epa signify . if the president of indonesi can release three pop music albums , it might just off ! lol"
11609,"i think that out be quite entertaining ! thats pretty good , making albums and running a country , multi taking !"
11610,it would be the thing on the take if we could have a president banana like zimbabwe redid !
11611,lol why ?
11612,"just because a would be funny and add levitt to what is always so serious . trump amy seem silly , but some equate him to a boxer that means business ."
11613,i see . did you now that presidents guest house is bigger than the white house ? lol
11614,"so it pays al little more to be the guest than the actual resident ! , ol"
11615,lol right ! have the president of zimbabwe can do a concert there !
11616,"indonesia , but the zimbabwe president may be just as talented lol ! i would n't mind having some presidential money , but it 's surprising to know that the welathiest were jfk , george washington , and thomas jefferson ."
11617,"oh sorry indonesia lol that info may possibly b wrong , last time i checked trump was the wealthiest by a lot !"
11618,"i was wondering unless it was adjusted for ge , etc . at any have , i 'm not making anything like that ! i 'm the kind that needs to have access to free websites and radio stations , though taht can come in handy . did you know you can listen to thousands of classic radio dramas online without spending anything ?"
11619,"nice ! fox you like classic radio dramas ? i dont think i would use that service , i really like audio books . i gues soliders used to make radios out of pencil and razor ! wow !"
11620,"that 's amazing . i wonder how they figured that ou if i wonder if hey were canadian if they had to somehow listen to 40 percent canadia content like the current law states . : ,"
11621,"probably not , they were soliders in wwi"
11622,"i was just joking because i thnk the law . sort of absurd . listen or play what you that . if that means you try o only pickup radio storms from jupiter , then so be it ."
11623,"oh lol i guess i missed that coke and relax it wrong lol yeah that canadian law is and weird , but they have a , lot of goo music , drake , celine dion , bryan adams lol . . . justin bieber"
11624,that is a fair point . do you watch much television ?
11625,"sort of . i watch a lot of tv shows and movie s , but i usually stream them , i dont watch real time tv"
11626,"there are so many options . take it , demon ; if you are into hat , you can binged like 750 episodes or ! that is crazy . ."
11627,"oh my , that is a lot of episodes ! great for kids ! i have never watched any pokemon . its been great chatting wit hyou !"
11628,"hello , do you listen to the radio ?"
11629,not really . do you ?
11630,yeah i do quite a bit i just have not managed to find that jupiter station
11631,"ha , kind of freaky that you can hear jupiter 's storms on the am radio !"
11632,i know taht is quite something . do you ever listen to canadian radios ?
11633,o do n't really . i heard that 40 percent to canadian radio music needs to be canadian in origin .
11634,yeah i guess they like to support their talent . do you know how soldiers her to make foxhole radios ?
11635,they used a razorblade and a pencil . i still do n't understand how though !
11636,yeah that is quite something . do you speak any latin ?
11637,i do not ! i wonder how many people do . maybe enough so tat a finnish radio station broadcasts a weekly program !
11638,"yeah i wa wandering about thati s well . how about radio dramas , do yu like those ?"
11639,i do n't like dramas in general so probalby not .
11640,"i see , because if you did there s a free radio to listen to them go"
11641,interesting . i prefer to watch tv . how about you ?
11642,"yes me too , i watch shows mainly like the simpsons"
11643,do you like bart ? there s only one episode where he does n't appear and is not mentioned . wonder where he went !
11644,"i love bart and that is really strange . how about pokemon , do you ever watch it ?"
11645,i hue do when i was younger . i ca n't believe there are 750 episodes .
11646,yeah but they have been around for 16 years
11647,yeah but it 's interesting that there is so much interest that they could make 750 episodes . i found the episodes quite similar to one another . i guess i was n't a die hard enough fan .
11648,"yeah i guess . how about that 70s show , do you ever watch it ?"
11649,"yes , i did . it 's so funny taht they tied to remake it verbatim in the uk ."
11650,hey . do you think the weekly standard will wait . ?
11651,well based on the information i 've read it does n't look good .
11652,do you think it was directly caused by their anti trump stance ?
11653,"i do . trump may be unpopular but he is still the commoner and chief . it was stated that ' on a more personal level , with trump at the land of the party , renouncing him meant jopaedizign decades of investment in a career as a conservative pundits , politician or policy wonka ."
11654,"i 'm not expert , but that sounds like a bad business decision to me"
11655,do you watch a lot of tv programs ?
11656,yes . i like the show south park . i have heard the simpsons crew sent them flowers after their family guy episode . lol
11657,"yeah the simpsons made way for a lot of other animated adult shows . did you new ' in the first 400 episodes , homer simpson has held 188 jobs ' ."
11658,i honestly did not know that . do you ever use he radio ?
11659,"only when i 'm driving but even thats not very often . this presidency has given snl so much to work with , reminds me of the main , biden debates . those were hi ; various ."
11660,yea i liked those too . were you ever a fan of pokemon ? it did over 750 episode s !
11661,no i was never a fan ut i know of its popularity . i forget what its called but someone got hurt looking for pokemon
11662,relaly . it was probably that pokemon ' go ' game where you and to hunt pokemon on your cell phone . i never played it .
11663,em either . did you know that the only u . s president to have a phd is woodrow wilson
11664,"no i did not . yet he still was n't one of th stop 3 wealthiest presidents . that honor goes to jkf , washington and jefferson ."
11665,"check his out , lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration and john wilkes booth was int hat photo ."
11666,that is crazy . so awful that booth assassinated him . a cowards and a traitor !
11667,"you asked me about radio earlier , do you listen ?"
11668,sometimes . i hae heard in canada that laws require radio station to play at least 40 percent canadian musi . waht an did law .
11669,i rememeber my grandmother trolling about a radio show called he shadow . it later became a movie with alec baldwin .
11670,never heard of that movie . was it popular ?
11671,"yeah for its time . i think it came out in the 80 's . hey did you know that one of the most popular radio acts of the 1930s wa sa ventriloquist , a lot which baffled contemporary critics ."
11672,that 's cool !
11673,goood evening . 69 hillary is at it again ?
11674,whats she doing this time .
11675,promoting her book it looks like . it 's called what happened .
11676,have n't heard of it to b honest .
11677,i 've herd of it but have n't read it .
11678,its rest a good thing its not like it used to be where the runner up in the election became vice president . then she would be our vice president .
11679,i could n't see her and the donald working together .
11680,it would be interesting to see though .
11681,it would ge that . trump is quite interesting himself with all his tweets and ranging about something or another . and his i get in there too . so much drama in the white house .
11682,yeah i could see adding hilary to the mix . great would be must see tv .
11683,"omg , it says the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana . ? they must have as much haha going on over there as we do ;"
11684,will the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office .
11685,that 's funny . i do n't think our presiden is able to do anything outside work because he 's had to turn over trump enterprise stop his kids while in office . so i guess we wont be hearing any music rpm him .
11686,i could se trump releasing an album . it would be a whole album dissing hilary and the dems .
11687,sometimes i get aggravated with that .
11688,if i was attacked or everything i do . every person i the to put on higpositions got attacked . i think i would be the same way . he knows how to fix teh problems we ahve ut the dems try to shut him down at every path . i would be frustrated to . h
11689,"yeah , i do get that . but eh goods back and forth . teh lawyer , for example , was his best friend . e tanked about him so highly nba then the lawyer got in trouble and now he is dissing him . i just do n't get it . but enough trump talk . did you see that in one episode of he simpsons bart does not appear , nor is mentioned ?"
11690,i alway watched fore homer to be honest . lol . dope .
11691,duh . lol . but bar ties always into some mischief . he could def be one of my boys .
11692,"yeah i liked bart to , b ut homer was funny ."
11693,"yeah , i liked hte babysitter episode . home definetly wanted that candy ."
11694,lol . he sure did . have a good one
11695,"intresting tht they paired tv , and radio with president ."
11696,"i agree . i find it really funny is south park made the family i episode , the actually got lower from the people who made the simpsons"
11697,"well , artists often do things saying they respect ethic others work ."
11698,"very true . speaking of the simpsons , did you know there 's only 1 episode never where bart is n't in it ?"
11699,i saw that . i wonder what that episode was about ?
11700,i could n't tell you the exact one . i could tell you that there are over 750 episodes of one of my favorite shows ' pokemon '
11701,i 've never seen it . i kind of think o romeo is a game .
11702,i 's a show and a game . i'ts been running for over 16 years now !
11703,what channel is tat on ?
11704,that 's a good question . i 'm not sure . i think it plays on various channels .
11705,maybe it ' e on netflix alike voltron .
11706,i know the movies are ! do you like listening to th radio ?
11707,"no , i 've done streaming like spotify for years ."
11708,i find some trivia on radio interesting though . jupiter has strong radio storms that can be picked up fro mama radio !
11709,thati as cool . i 'm surprised that a simple am radio can do that .
11710,"i was too ! but hey , it 's even weirder that canadian laws require 40 percent of the music to be canadian . i did that hilarious"
11711,i saw tht . i imagine that skates for some weird playlists for djs
11712,oh yeah for sure . there 's sa finnish radio station that has a news programme entirely in latin .
11713,"thats trange to , but at least it 's only one radio show ."
11714,"i think it ' pretty all ! then again , i go to a website that has a lot of classic radio drama for free"
11715,like thos older audio serials from before tv was popular ?
11716,do you know much about presidents ?
11717,"hello , do you like television ?"
11718,i do . i love watching snl especially the weekend update .
11719,"i love snl . is yo know when south park aired the family guy episode , they received flowers from the simpsons crew ?"
11720,"yeah , i heard that . it was because of the parody , righty ."
11721,i think so lol . there is only one episode of the simpson where bart is not in .
11722,"i know , that is kind of crazy . i guess i never noticed that . h eis just aways around ."
11723,yep me either . i saw he 70 's show was made in the uk and was cancelled after only 10 shows .
11724,"wow , i guess they didnt love it like people did here . did you realize state in the first 400 episodes of the simpsons homer had 188 jobs . i thought he always worked at the plant ."
11725,oh wow that 's a lot of job . i had no idea .
11726,"me neither , that kind of shocked em . do you remember the treehouse of horror xxi from the simpsons ?"
11727,i do not remember hat . was it a good episode ?
11728,it had daniel radcliffe voicing edward cullen .
11729,oh wow that 's awesome . do you like he radio ?
11730,"i do , listen more to podcasts . about i love jamming out to the radio"
11731,me too . did you know you can hear jupiter radio storms on earth ?
11732,"taht is cool , il leave to check that out . ou can also listen to the sun 's music , too ."
11733,that 's pretty cool too . soldiers in wwii made simple radios by using razorblades and pencils .
11734,i couldnt even figured that one out now . that was pretty genius of them .
11735,very cool and probably helped out wit morale too
11736,"i bet , entertainment wawa likely very important . plus a great way t keep up with info ."
11737,it wa agreat chatting with yu .
11738,do you think what nick saban did to the espn reporter was ok ?
11739,i was wondering the same thing . i think personally that it was definitely wrong to snap even if you have a legitimate reason to be so tense .
11740,"exactly . you can have some sympathy , without telling them what they are asked not , but reporters cna be intense ."
11741,"yes definitely but it 's just general wisdom to try to maintain patience and meet frustrating situations with a level head of course . but then again , he did apologize so it 's not like he 's some bad guys t all ."
11742,do you think saban will call the reporter and apologize ?
11743,"actually i heard that he already did , or at least someone tweeted as much ."
11744,did n't know . to be honest i am surprised he did .
11745,"oh really , why is that ? i 'm sure he realized that people would probably be able to sympathize with his frustration with the reporters , so why not apologize ."
11746,"he a definitely not the kind of people who apologize was if he did , i am pretty sure eh was being pressure by the media ."
11747,"oh , hmm maybe what tweet by james miller was incorrect i guess . what makes you think he 's not the type to apologize ?"
11748,i am pretty good at telling how people are by the way their behave . i this is not teh first time he responds liek that .
11749,"oh i did n't know that , when did he do it before ?"
11750,"almost most of the time he is going interview . that ; s why the reporter said : we got to yes ago , w with thee xasperated shih sand snarky responses that come whenever you famer reporters ' questions"
11751,"oh yes , that 's true ut t least that ' so as explosive as eh behaved with america taylor recently ."
11752,really ? ! what did ge did to her ? have n't heard about it .
11753,"he snapped at the , and gave an abrasion response to a fair question ."
11754,ww ! ! that 's way too much . do n't you think he should be suspended ?
11755,"i 'm not sure , he did apologize at least but i am not so familiar with the context o flow they usually punish off the field behavior like that . i guess some sort of penalty would be fair , but maybe not a whole suspension ?"
11756,"you are kind of right , but definitely something underneath is going on with him ."
11757,"i guess , maybe id o n't think it 's the big of seal to be upset as longs s you acknowledge tha tit was wrong . a bit of eager can eb healthy ."
11758,and i have to admit that the reporter wa pushing him a little bit .
11759,yeah exactly .
11760,hello ! do you liek rock music ?
11761,hi ! i love rock music adn a has been for a while now . it kind since the 60s .
11762,"leah , it 's definitely a classic and great genre . white snake has had over 50 members tough it 's history . that 's crazy !"
11763,i know . the last as its own wikipedia page .
11764,"i wonder why so many people ended up leaving or joining the band . do you know if they were just a specific position switching out , like a guitarist ?"
11765,"i guess they may not have get used to that life style . did you know that a song became popular because a dj did n't reveal the band name . do n't remember where it was , but still incredible ."
11766,that 's pretty interesting . sonic the hedgehog was supposed to have been and a rock band . i wonder how that would have worked out .
11767,"hahaha . honestly , i have noi idea . i also heard that he have a blond haired . , man girlfriend named madonna ."
11768,that 's really strange . i 'm glad he just stayed a video game character . viktor tsoi kept his job in a boiler room after booking the biggest rock star in russian history .
11769,"russian already sounds like rock always . rock is kind of interesting , even oklahoma has w stated rock song ."
11770,that 's pretty cool . did you know the man who assassinated abraham lincoln was named after them an who assassinated julius caesar ?
11771,todo much coincidence . abraham lincoln has a unusual voice . do you know how he sounded ?
11772,"apparently he had a high pitch voice , i have would have guessed that ! i always imagined him as having a deep voice for some reason ."
11773,"me too . the say the he used to , even his important documents in his hat . that ' ; s kind of funny mn ow we knw why th that was so high . hahahah"
11774,"he had so many secrets in there , lol ! lincoln created the secure service hte morning he was the . that seems suspicious ."
11775,i think so too . abraham lincoln was the first republican as well .
11776,that interesting ! he started a long line of bearded republicans !
11777,he had done goo things as well . he preserved the union and abolished slavery .
11778,"yeah , he was very nice and good hearted . he was also a lawyer before becoming a politician !"
11779,i wonder if he was a good lawyer . i hear de also modernized the economy .
11780,"yes , he was a very gold president ! well , it as nice chatting with you !"
11781,see you next time
11782,"hi , how are you today ? do you like rock music ?"
11783,"hi ! i do like rock music , i like a little bit of everything ."
11784,the state rock song do oklahoma is ' do you realize ? ' b y the flaming lips . i did n't know that states had rock songs .
11785,especially a lot of midwestern states been to have songs attacked to them . i was reading tha whitesnake has had over 50 members in utah history . they must not be fun o work with .
11786,"i guess not . maybe it 's band to put on your resume , then move on . i do n't know how much they tour . it could be a tough gig ."
11787,"probably some overdose . i read that a hanson song became the most requested track on a chicago station not because people like it , but the station created an air of mystery about it by not telling people who sang the song g ."
11788,"that was very smart of them . get new listeners , more advertising . probably a boy band is not what most listeners were looking for ."
11789,"i heard the sonic the hedgehog character wass exposed to be a member of a rock band , and the a girlfriend named madonna , but i did n't hear the those story . do you know ?"
11790,long in a rock band ? i guess he has the haircut for it . he could probably have joined whitesnake e .
11791,"h yeah , that would have been good . are you interested in history ? i was reading about lincoln . he had a high pitch voice , i guess ."
11792,that 's funny because he was very tall l he kept his important dochmetns aside his hat . i guess that nat wa pretty big .
11793,"you know , i always mean to do some research to see if he maybe had some kind of genetic disorder . he was so tall , and had such strange bone structure . especially hearing about hi swear voice now , i 'm even more curious s ."
11794,"he had a pretty big beard , so i would have expected a deep voice . he was an unusual guy that met a tragic end ."
11795,i would expect deep voice too . did you know he created the secret service the very monringh e was assassinated ? ironic .
11796,i guess he recognized tha the was at tremendous risk because of the war and his treatment ot slaves . i o ' r know i the secret service coul dave saved him .
11797,"no , i 'm sure they could n't have . john wilkes booth father was named after the man that assassinated julius caesar . what a strange story all around ."
11798,"yeah , lots of weird connections . lincoln had a secretary named kennedy . jfk had a secretary named lincoln . it 's kinsmen ."
11799,ridge never heard that . those types of coincidences are always interesting to see .
11800,"we can always find connections if we look hard enough . for example , lance herniksen and bill parton are the only wo actors to face off against a terminator , an alien add a predator . connections abound ."
11801,"ohh sur , i guess bender from futurama and the terminator both have the same cpu ."
11802,that 's great ! bender is savage . he really co ; lot be a terminator . never quite get the salary for arnold though .
11803,i ca n't believe he gets paid so much . h only said lionel 00 words in terminator .
11804,his physique is the key ; . plus that austria accent .
11805,its been nice talking to you !
11806,great chat ! have a good day 2
11807,i you have a great day too
11808,hi ! so do you like music ? i love rock music and will many other genre 's .
11809,"yes , i 'm the same ! i love music . . . . i didn ? t know the band whitesnake has had over 50 members over time ? thinking the lead singer stayed the same , not sure ?"
11810,"that is something i read too , i do believe the nba singer is the same . there was so much great rock music back in the day !"
11811,"oh , i know , decades . there was so much and people today have no idea how great alot of it was ! !"
11812,"very true ! i really ; love the electric guitars in rock , it 's all good . i got to see the best bands in concert that 's for sure lol"
11813,you sound like me ! i have been to so many concerts and have bought so muh mail over the was . i hav alot to refer back to . do you have favorite hands ?

11815,"yes , i have seen pink floyd a few time sand aerosmith every tinder hey came to our state . i heard they were going to do las vegas for awhile . i g back to elvis , beatles , a ll the 70 adn 80 90 bands . i have tickets to the who this year and bryan adams lol far ! lol"
11816,"hhaa ! that 's awesome , you sound like me , i kept memento 's along the a swell , in the 90s i went to see candlebox and th drummer cams up to me and handed me his drug still , and i have met many , i wish i could ave seen fuzzy but levee did which is a bummer ."
11817,"i know , i would have like that too ! very cool . its hard to get the up front seats ! lol , while in texas i saw rod stewart and manage to get two balls tha might . i went this last year and had second level sea ton the side and one of those guns came opt o me and a friend and gave us front row center ! we were shocked ! ! very happy taht nigh ! ! lol"
11818,"wow , that is amazing ! you have been to as many concerts or more than i hav 'll , i just love seeing get so i will pay for up front if i can , i got real close tot he cult and queensryche , bbq at a van halen concert i saw some famous people next to me ."
11819,"really , that 's so interesting ! one of favorites is led zepp lucky to see them in 77 , and then again when robert plant and jimmy page did a tour together and had close eats . very cool . would be been nice to see them in 2007 in the uk . i think those tickets sold out in minutes at a very high price !"
11820,"you got to see led zeppelin ' ? wow , that is awesome . i love those guys ! yes , not always easy to get tickets they sell fast ! especially these days . but just alike music we go the see all the great movies too , did you ever see the terminator ?"
11821,"yes , i enjoyed it . i ca n't believe he only made 75 , 000 in the first one ! !"
11822,i know ! but he did make 15 million in the 2nd one so that 's great ! he only had to spend 18 lines in the terminator and less than 100 words lo . . . i would take 75 grand for that !
11823,"lol , i know . . . . he you been to the terminator ride at universal ?"
11824,"no i have n't but i did go to universal studios back in the late 90s and west to the terminator 3d show , wow i was blown away ! ! how was the ride ?"
11825,"yes , that 's the one i mean ! where an actor comes ou stand sides all around in a motorcycle with the gun ! ! alot of fun ! ! the 3d movie was great ! !"
11826,"yes ! that is it , but i seemed like you were in a crazy ride lol . that franchise is worth 3 billion dollars that 's pretty amazing for older movies ."
11827,"yes , i agree . a fu thing to know about abraham lincoln , he kept important papers in his hat and his name a high pitched voice ! who knew ?"
11828,"really ? that 's odd about his voice , he took so rough lol . he was a great president though . and how does it happen that he gets assasinated just after creating the secret service , wow ."
11829,"i didnt ' know state they , surprised me . the same morning ! in the films about guin he always has a deep voice ! ! great chat ! !"
11830,"i know , very bad for the poor guy . thanks for the chat ! i need ti go listen to some good rock music and watch the terminator now lol ! bye ! !"
11831,hello . do you like rock music ? rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as ' rock and roll ' in the us in the early 1950s adn developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later in the uk as well as the us .
11832,"yes i do like rock music ! i especially like that a lot of rock artists seem to be down to earth , like even after becoming the biggest rock star rain russian history , viktor tsoi kept his job in the boiler room ."
11833,that 's too funny . did you know that the state rock song of oklahoma is ' do you realize ? ' by the flaming lips ?
11834,i did n't know saves could have hate rock songs ! i wonder if illinois ' is the song that became the most requested track on that chicago altrock radio station .
11835,"that could e . you mean that hanson song ? yes , the dj didn ' reveal who sang the song or what band did and so everyone wanted to hear who did it , probably ."
11836,"yes tht 's the one ! i think it 's interesting that no one knew the ban for its members . on the other hand you have had alike whitesnake , which has had over 50 members throughout it 's history ."
11837,whitesnake was one of my favorite bands . i did ' kno that they had so many members that trey had their own wikipedia page about it though . funny .
11838,"i also saw recently on wikipedia that sonic the hedgehog nwas actually supposed to be a member of a rockband , with a blond human girlfriend named madonna !"
11839,"right , very funny . i heard that one , too . rock music is actually very interesting , it typically has a 4 or 4 time signature using a versechorus form but it was become extremely diverse . like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social o even political ."
11840,"yeah rock music is definitely fascinating . i like that it draws from a lot of other genres i enjoy , like jazz , classical , blues and folk music ."
11841,"yes , i like that too . did you see te terminator ? did you know that arnold schwarzenegger speaks only 81 lines in ' the terminator ' and less than 190 words in totals ? i did n't realize that before ."
11842,"i neveda new that ! i wonder if he had a bigger role in terminator 2 , because i know his pay got significantly bumped from 75k fo 'the first movie veto 15 million with the second ."
11843,"it could be . i remember that the terminator movies necompassed a series of films , comics , novels and additional media concerning battles between skynet 's synthesis intelligent machine network and john connery 's resistance forces nd the rest of hte human race ."
11844,"yeah i 'm sure a lot of people appreciated the unique concept of hte films . that 's probably why as of 2010 , the franchise has made over 8 billion in revenue !"
11845,"yes , i agree . also , scientists developed a reallife 100 palmer , threw oled 's first selffixing plastic call th terminator ."
11846,"that 's crazy ! it 's certainly a unique material . although i think the terminator itself shut the most unique robot ; bender from futurama shares the same processor , the 6502 pu ."
11847,"yes , and that 's same cpu used in atari 2600 , nes , and c64 computer movie . that is amazing ."
11848,"on a separate note , are you interested in abraham lincoln at all ? i find it fascinating the father of his assassination was named after the killer of julius caesar ."
11849,"yes , the whole abraham lincoln saga is strange , in my opinion . in fact , ironically , abe created the secret service the morning he was fatally shot by john wilkes booth ."
11850,"that 's surprising ! i wonder if things would have been different if he ad created it sooner . i also wonder if his killer found any important documents in lincoln 's hat , where he kept them ."
11851,"yes , the answers to which we will probably never find out . nice chatting with you , have a good one ."
11852,hi how are you doing over there ?
11853,fine . are you a movie in ?
11854,"yes , i am a movie fan . i think hat there are only fine movies done nyt om cruise ."
11855,loved him in aikman and jerry mcguire . own do you think of his mission impossibe films ?
11856,he has done a great job finding costar that round out thee last . the shoes are strong too .
11857,ca n't say . only saw the 1st film . heard that angela bassett us in the latest film ? ike her a lot . nice costar are your favorite ?
11858,i like simon peg . ving rhymes is also god ; thsoe are a couple of others that i forgot .
11859,what do go think about cruise still doing his own stunts at age 56
11860,i think that he is taking a risk that could stop production send cost a lot of money . i see no need for it .
11861,"i agree . seems odd that cruise , who has won a golden globe award , never won an oscar for best actor . he 's starred in so many films !"
11862,"he doest do tha right kind of films , or doesnt play the right role . in rain man , he did not have a disease . in born on the fourth of july , he probably had a chance bu 'the other films were good ."
11863,the film i felt he really wanted an oscar for was jerry maguire . so memorable . do you agree ?
11864,"he did a great job , but i as a date movie bout sport sand the academy lives middle now stuff . weighted material about war and diseases ."
11865,"date and sports movie , yes , but i 'll never forget it . di you know the m . i . series started in 1996 ?"
11866,"there was a tv show before that . the finns started in the 90s , i know ."
11867,"the 60 's tv show at a bit silly , but that was part of its appeal ; tester , end the taprrecorded mission messages . . . eve see a rerun ?"
11868,"yeah , probably a couple . it was 60s tv , a bit cam , i , but what are you going to do ? it was the time of odd soundtracks and wider clothes ."
11869,"yes ! m . i . films do n't seem to take themselves too seriously , i '"
11870,"which is good . im on , come on , its a spy show with silly masks nd stuf . have fun ! its hollywood ! escape for two hours ."
11871,agreed . do you plan to see the latest installment : m . i layout ?
11872,"i would like to . it got good reviews . noway , great chat !"
11873,enjoy your om cruise movie ! centers !
11874,are you a to cruise fan ?
11875,creed i think he 's a great actor . how about you ?
11876,i trink he is pretty good . he had n't won many awards though . did you know that ?
11877,"i did not , seems like he would have . did yo like mj . i . fallout ?"
11878,i have n't sen i the is that the latest one ?
11879,"yeah i give it a 7 but i will still go and see the next one , lol !"
11880,"yeh , i 'll eventually see it . he 's pretty entertaining to be honest . i liked him in his , y business . hilarious ."
11881,oh my go you taking me back now . you k now e made 75million from one movie ?
11882,"no , i didnt know that . he also built an underground bunker ."
11883,"underground bunker ! does he kno something we do ' ; t , lol . do you know he vandalized the worlds tallest building ?"
11884,he 's probably losing it a bit to be does . it would n't surprise me .
11885,yeah apparently back in 2010 he sketches kate holmes name into a sport .
11886,"mmmm , is that true ? it would n't surprise me one bit ."
11887,"apparently he does his own stunts , he hung of a airplane at 5 , 000 feet ."
11888,"yeah , that will do the trick . what about inception , have you seen it ?"
11889,that is one of my all time favorite movies . you ?
11890,i saw it . i got confused throughout it . i did n't realize they tried to ban will smith . did you ?
11891,i did not glad they didnt ' i like all . it took nolan 10 years to write inception .
11892,"wow , taht is a long time to take to write a script . well , nice chatting with you !"
11893,"i knows but it grossed 88 million world wide , the 4th highest in 2010 ."
11894,"nice , well , that it easy ."
11895,hey ! have you heard of tom cruise ? what do you think about him doing his down stunts ?
11896,"i thinks that he is a great actor , ive always thought he had mad skills nad thin its kind of dangerous him doing his own stunts"
11897,"i totally agree with you but on the other hand , it is kind of cool and are the movies more realistic . although mission impossiblefallout is pretty far out there as far rags realism goes ."
11898,"i agree , m movies are becoming unrealistic like that , they have become too scaled , irrational ."
11899,"i know , take he mission impossible movie for example ; . tom cruise does a motorcycle chase in paris . that 's not bad but what is is that there 's hardly anyone on the road . totally fake ."
11900,"yeah totally fake indeed , what i do like bout the movie i 'the different locations , paris , london , kashmir ."
11901,"that us nic a it 's all good yo look at . even tom cruise is , adn he 's 56 years old !"
11902,he doesnt look like he has 56 years ! i heard he made 7500o000f ron mission impossible 3
11903,"that 's way too much money ! he gets away with so much stuff , like scratching kate holmes 's name in the world 's tallest building ."
11904,"wow i wonder why he would do that , you know he spent two years learning swordplay and also japanese for a movie ."
11905,"stat 's good and shows some depth . on the other hand , he did spend 10 million on a bunker that 's underground tho protect himslef from aliens !"
11906,that seems a bit paranoid m speaking of movies did you watch inception ?
11907,i do n't think i have . is it any good ?
11908,"its actually pretty good , its directed by christopher nolan , hte movie had 1828 million in sales ."
11909,wow ! is n't that the movie with leonardo dicaprio in it ?
11910,"yea leonardo is the leading actor , you know two famous actors rejected he part , i bet they regretted that ."
11911,really ? which one did that ? seems lie you always hear of big names rejecting parts and then finding out the movies too fantastic .
11912,"will smith and brat pitt are the ones that declined the role , ad yeah i bet they though it was going to be a lousy movie ."
11913,"they are very different that , leonardo . i wonder how the movie would have been with one of them instead . tom cruise has a wide range of movies from top gun tp rain many though . i guess he coud do any role ."
11914,"i bet it would be different forms 've , i liked top gun i think it was a that movie ."
11915,"it was a good movie . i did see that one way back in the day ! you got me thinking about that movie , inception , though . was n't elon musk 's wife in it ?"
11916,"yeah she was in it , i though she was pretty good , you should definitely watch it , great movie ."
11917,good afternoon 21 a you a fan of moves ?
11918,yes . are you a fan of the mission impossible film series ? to cruise made 75m from mission impossible iii alone !
11919,i 'm not that much of a fan of tc movies as i used to be maybe because they ' ; re all pretty much the same as with mi series . i do like his early work
11920,ye i'n ot either . must be nic so make that kind of money .
11921,"you said it so much money to make essentially these and movie over and over and over . . . cocktail is probably my favorite movie of his , and that was decades ago !"
11922,they are repetitive . i did n't care for ' the last samurai ' but i did like ' top gun . '
11923,did n't see th last samurai . i heard htey were making a big sequel winder how that will be received ?
11924,probably not as well a i day during the reagan admin . i did n't realize elon use was in inception .
11925,"i thought i heard about elon musk in inception , but i cannon recall what character he played ? i 've seen that movie seveelat is to try to understand it !"
11926,no kidding ! it was sooooo hard to follow . it took 10 years or nolan to write something that confusing .
11927,jack about a passion project ! probably needed multiple flow charts to keep track of everything . . . .
11928,yeah ! i was wrong . . . it was musk 's wife that was in inception . i have no idea what she lol like . nolan got his son in the movie soo .
11929,aha ! i was just racking my brain about em in that movie ! and now i need to figure out who his wife is ! ! !
11930,"sorry : , i will say cruise is dedicated . he spent two years learning japanese fort he last samurai ."
11931,"i think the concept of the lasts samurai is fascinating , becuase o that it implies their only purpose in life is to protect their master and if they fail to do that the must kill themselves . in the rare occasion hedy are without a master due to their circumstances , they go cronin , another great movie , and basically become a mercenary ."
11932,it 's kind of true for cruise in that he spent 10m for a bunker to protect himself from aliens . i wonder if that 's true . i know he 's a little wacky but that seems a bit i much .
11933,that probably has more do with him being a scientologist than anything and the most popular member of that religion to boo t !
11934,yeah i heard of that . he did such kate holmes name on the top of the bury khalifa building . that 's wacky so . . .
11935,"all this tc trivia is a little creepy , feeling like i need a shower ! i almost forgot about the satire holmes marriage and did . . . . he sure has led a full life"
11936,"yes , but i too am having to rethink him . i really did like him in risky business back in the day . he actually does his stunts like hanging from a plane at 5 , 000 feet in the newest mi ."
11937,"risky business was bet , i was a huge rebbeca de monday fan when i was younger . . ."
11938,"yeah , she is or was hot . thanks for the chat . you were excellent !"
11939,"hi , how are you ?"
11940,"hello , did you watch jurassic world : fallen kingdom ? what are your thoughs on this movie"
11941,i did not see it . did you ?
11942,"i did , i liked it but there are some absorb scenes that didnt make sense at all"
11943,"was that the second one with chris pratt ? i saw the first one , not the second one ."
11944,"yeah exactly thats the one with pratt , he is a velociraptor trainer in the movie"
11945,i think i only saw that becuase my wife has a crush on him . i think he may have been shirtless on the trailer so my wife was all in on the movie . did you like it ?
11946,"i liked t , i though it was a nice movie although many parts here angela likd when the volcano exploded and he suddenly can move again ."
11947,ill check it out whe it comes to netlfix . . . i found it odd that the dinosaurs were only on the screen for 15 minutes . must have had a small cgi budget .
11948,"yah , im guessing its a expensive production overall , theres a cool fact and theyd used elephant rams for the tea"
11949,really ? i recently heard that dinosaurs ad really small and more cars . not at all like what is projected a movies or on tv .
11950,"maybe they projected it this way so that they would sound scarier , also gelociraptors were smaller than projected in movies ."
11951,did you see that the park ride cost more than her movie to make ?
11952,"no i actual , fly didn they that , os are you a dijarour fan ? i used to love the when i was a little kid"
11953,i really did not get into them . that and space were never really that intriguing to me . what about you ?
11954,"i like them , i think there are many interesting facts about them i heard scientists recovered a sample of issue and goood vessel from a trip"
11955,"really ! wow , i wonder if they are going to try and clone it . seems like something que would o and ten immediately regret . . ."
11956,"yeah , jurassic park should work as a warning lol , that would definetely have things ."
11957,i ca unsee them sewing it up and lavigne same sad creature that only semiresembles a dinosaur . it would be an ethical diploma fort sure .
11958,"for sure , it would generate a lot of dispute so anyways o you like how chris pratt cats ?"
11959,i of know some like he worked at bubble gump . nice chatting with you !
11960,did you watch jurassic world : fallen kingdom ?
11961,"no , but i have heard same but it . at least they one is not running i whig wheels in that movie !"
11962,there are 7 scene that dont make sense at all
11963,i remember talk about one . . chris pratt is paralyzed by a tranquilizer darth but then crawl away from allen lava using his paralyzed limbs . ha !
11964,yeah and also thee computer parts of the old park still function that is also an absurd thing
11965,someone was amused by chris great doing a somersault through the open mouth of a red .
11966,is that the scene in which chris pratt defies physics ? because thats lso another ridiculous scene
11967,apparently he became an athlete after being a house builder . that seemed stange .
11968,it does seem strange and so how in the middle of te film pratt developed ensue seal skills in a magical way
11969,one reviewer also said yahoo he movie managed to make dinosaurs boring whig is hard o do .
11970,"i didnt really like the movie , the old jurassic park movies were so much better amy icnonsistensies i do like the leading actor"
11971,apparently the dinosaurs only appears or 15 minutes in the film . universal built a ride that cost them more than the film did .
11972,really ? how much did it cost ?
11973,the ride cost 110 million while the film was 6 6million .
11974,oh seems like they should send more in the movie and add more dinosaur time in it . did you hear about the joke chris pratt made about the franchise
11975,i think people do get bored looking a too much dinosaur time . the people are more interesting . what was pratt 's joke ?
11976,he smoked about getting the part in 2010 for jurassic park 4
11977,"wow ! that is like a premonition . i guess i will make a note about winning power ball . i guess you know taht the raptors are not computer generated , but are people ind dinosaur suits ?"
11978,"really ? they fooled me , i thought that was the computer , it sure takes a long time to render the frame of the three dinosaur"
11979,i suppose that is because of the raindrops and water griping from trey .
11980,the detail is impressive i guess thats why it takes o long to render them
11981,"i think so too . well , ny wife is asking me to go get some whipping cream for some chicken soup so i am going to wrap it up . nice chatting with you ."
11982,"you wouldnt want to upset the wife ! hope you have a nice meal , thanks for tb cha and the cool facts ."
11983,have you seen jurassic world ?
11984,"i tried watching it but it had some many ' be , inability ' problems from talking to veloc85aptors to costuming ."
11985,yeah it was a bit cheesy . i do like chris pratt though .
11986,"yeah , he 's cool even though his sudden navy seal special forces transition was a bit much ."
11987,the dinosaurs only appears for 15 minutes
11988,really ? seemed like musc the same with the predictable humans overs ins where that usually turns out bad .
11989,well it only grossed 63 million and it cost 110 million .
11990,maybe deviwating from cgi had a price . there were actually people inside of suits for the dinos .
11991,no cgi wo what a rip off . apparently pratt joked about the lead role .
11992,"no surprise there . : , he 's come a long way for , waiting cables at 19 . at a baba gump nonetheless . . ."
11993,"that 's for sure , you know it took 6 hours to render one frame of soaked rained trey ."
11994,i 'm not the i have the patience for that . did you know 04 percent of american think humans an dinos lived at the same time ?
11995,wow too funny ! james gun wanted pratt for guardian so bad he was willing to cgi hum as i pack .
11996,hee . yep would just exercise . wonder if pratt made a similar deal whe spielberg casted with in jp 4 .
11997,yeah probably . did you know that all 50 states have dino fossil in them .
11998,pretty cool . maybe thats ' why caned came up with a glow in te dark dino coin .
11999,do you know who they were considering for the role i guardians before pratt ?
12000,the guy that plays dennis on sunny in philly ?
12001,"i never at the show , do you think he would have done a better job ?"
12002,no . id o watch the show adn it 's funny but i can see him doing better .
12003,th original jp 's were much better in my opinion .
12004,it looks that way given the dinos serie only theres 5 minutes . i also think people are a little burned out on jp .
12005,yup . well it was nice chatting wit you have a good day .
12006,"hi , do are you ?"
12007,"hello . so ive an reading about jurassic world : fallen kingdom , and chris pratt . i havent ethan fallen kingdom yet though ."
12008,m too . is there anything that stood out for you ?
12009,"bout he movie , a little , but i became really interested in the last paragraph when it talked about hows scientists expressed the genes of chickens and they grew teeth ."
12010,i was a little surprised teh dinosaurs were only on film for 15 minutes . seems like that is not a lot . . .
12011,"htey did a good job ot really building suspense so when they were in screen , it was a big deal !"
12012,that 's true . really good point . i loved the michael creighton book so i never saw the original jurassic park in fear that it would ruin the book . still have n't seen it . . .
12013,"i think aside fro joy husband 's obsession , th movies feel a bit dated , the older ones do , so it might be harder to see ."
12014,"i did see the first one with chris pratt but that is all i ahve seen . i think i sa wit because my wife may or may lot have a thing fo chris pratt , postparks and rec when he got ripped d ."
12015,"that 's true , he became really hot lol . he was pretty good in parks and rec , but as star lord she just looks it . he does really good . silly movies ."
12016,"agreed . can you imagine how waiting on you at bubble gump , and he seeing him on tv a few weeks later ?"
12017,"that would be hilarious . life bey honey , was n't that far wait ? oh heck , he 's made it to tv ! hhaa ."
12018,he would n't be the most incredible actor who made the jump . he is talented at those roles though . . .
12019,"heard . i have n't seen him n any of the other movies listed like ' her ' or ' delivery man ' but the few i have seen , he 's pretty funny and sells hte role ."
12020,the generic role . . . ' delivery man ' that 's funny . i really liked parks nd rec . did you ?
12021,"yeah , though i never finished it because i got tired of how aggressive nessie nope was after a while . and it felt weird that her dream became the focus , and ben ' a just got crushed . kinda opposite of feminist ."
12022,"ha ! yeah , as someone who works in parks and rec , t got really corny , really fast but i was so impressed with the writing . it was so good ."
12023,"the writing was great , its . chris pratt and april made the show for me . happy dog and angry cat !"
12024,ha ! i always liked the ' damning jerry ! ' when jerry would not do anything wrong . that poor guy .
12025,"i saw im isn another tc show recently , for a one time part , he brooklyn 99 , he was funny for a one time bit . poo guy indeed ."
12026,i must have missed that one . i love 99 . that 's another well written show . almost got cancelled so i am glad nbc picked it up .
12027,yes i 've been watching it on zulu episode by episode as it continues !
12028,nice shutting with you !
12029,did you her that clowns copyright heir makeup designs on eggshells ?
12030,"i new heard that one . also , american makeup companies have resume animal testing so they can sell products inc china ."
12031,"how is animal testing related to selling products in china ? sorry , i do n't get that one . . ."
12032,not sure but maybe it 's required to happen before chung will buy ? keanu gave 80 million of his 114 million matrix salary o special effects and makeup staff
12033,"i wonder why ? d id n't movie producers pay when as well ? ; ,"
12034,probably not that much
12035,". . . but they probably did and special effects staff agreed to it . . . maybe keanu could give that money to charity . . . : , just thinking at did ; ,"
12036,did you know that until 1800 both hand knitting wand machine knitting were used o make socks but after 1800 it was mostly machines knitting
12037,"it 's hard for me to believe tha t : , i 'm sure a lot od people were doing it the old way . . ."
12038,a seems like you probably are right bt he acoustic era grave rise tot he expression ' put a sock on it ' because people put a sock in the phonograph horn to mute it .
12039,"lol ; , that 's a one my to use it ! : , i wonder what were they doing when wife or husband were too loud or was talking too much : ,"
12040,lol . i just learned that best buy and target will price match amazon .
12041,bestbuy ? do you believe that ? they are usually very expensive . . .
12042,i do n't know but i hope so ! the first target opened in 1963 in minnesota .
12043,"they both try to catch up after amazon , bu ti think amazon ill out perform both of these . . ."
12044,it might in the long run . sears i going out of business and other malls that are bricks nd mortar sad to see . vermont is teh only state to not have a target store though .
12045,"not yet you mend : , i wonder why . . . ny laws prohibiting it to open ?"
12046,i do n't know . i doubt that . target has n't carried any tobacco products since 1996 . good for them .
12047,"i mean morally good , but i 'm guessing they lost a lot of money by doing so . . . do n't you think ?"
12048,i do n't know . does walmart sell cigarettes ?
12049,"i would n't know , i 've never smoke , ed , :"
12050,"80 percent of supplements though sold in walmart , walgreens , target an dnc contain none of the advertised herbs , so wonder ow they con legally advertise ?"
12051,"how 's it going , did you know michael chili went bald because of z mishap with theater makeup ?"
12052,realy ? id be so many !
12053,"yea , chili was only 20 at the time too , i wonder what makeup cause edit"
12054,"well , the ancient greeks used white lead . that couldnt have been good for them ."
12055,sounds like a bad idea . did you know clowns copyright their makeup designs on eggshells ?
12056,no . you does one even do that ? i am not into makeup myself . just never cared to wear ay . i think it i cook keanu reeves gave 80 million f his salary from the matrix to the special effects laden make up crew
12057,keanu is a great guy . apparently in team america the kim jongil statue was just a person in makeup
12058,"probalby , make up cant really transform you into almost anyone"
12059,"yea , it 's a shame that american cosmic companies has gone back to animal testing though"
12060,i thought they outlawed that a long time ago . poor animals .
12061,apparently it ' song so makeup can b sold in china
12062,still doesnt make it right . i gues science some of it is made from coconut oil it isnt as bad .
12063,"yea , places like target should refuse to sell , i mean they already refuse to sell tobacco in their shoes"
12064,adn they have banned the salvation army bell fingers .
12065,i wonder why ? i never knew vermont does n't have any targets in the state
12066,"they dont ? they are sure messing out bt quartet is great , they hav eleven trademarked the fake french ' target ' because it became so popular ."
12067,"that 's pretty funny , i guess price matching amazon helps target be so popular"
12068,"it really would . if 9 can grab it and not wait , i am good to go ."
12069,yea the amazon price match is a nice perk but it can be a hassle to deal with the target employees
12070,did you know it wa sounded the slave year as walmart ?
12071,"no , i have no clue . well i have to go , nice chatting with you"
12072,"hi , do you like cosmic s ?"
12073,hello . how are you ?
12074,i 'm great thanks you . di you know im jongil 's statue in team america was just a person dressed up in makeup ?
12075,no . i never would have though that .
12076,me either . chili went bald at 20 due to a bad makeup disaster .
12077,i did hear that before .
12078,i also saw clowns copyright their makeup designs on eggshells .
12079,that is interesting . keanu reeves gave 80 million of his matrix salary to special effects and makeup staff .
12080,wow thats z lot of money ! good for him for doing that .
12081,yes . very nice of im to treat those people that way .
12082,do you read socks ?
12083,yes . most times .
12084,same here . did you know socks are among the most needed item in a homeless shelter ?
12085,no . i was not aware of that .
12086,do you lie target ?
12087,sure . i shop there once a month .
12088,i do as well . best buy and target will prices match amazon which is really cool .
12089,yes . that is the reason i like shopping there .
12090,vermont is the only state without a target store .
12091,that is surprising . i thought that they were everywhere .
12092,"i thought so too . well , ot was good talking to you . have a god day !"
12093,did you know spider man first appeared in comics back in 1962 ?
12094,i did not know that ! spiderman is one of my favorite heroes
12095,mine too . i liek that he had to deal with all life struggles and even financial issues .
12096,yeah i think his one of the poorest super heroes in the marvel universe but one of the smartest ones a swell .
12097,he did aways seem too be short of money did n't he ? his enemies were mostly rich though i think . i think the green goblin had money .
12098,"yeah taht a curious fact t , most of his enemies ad ton of cash i guest hats what fake spiderman special"
12099,"stan lee created him to be special , right now to his name . the only reason there is a hyphen in i is so he could n't be confused with superman n ."
12100,"thats funny lol , his first appearance was on the comic book amazing fantasy , that comic book must be worth thousands now ! at least the original version"
12101,i imagine you are very right about that ! i wonder if that comic had cap'n crunch 's arch rivals in it . i 've heard they have battled spiderman at some point .
12102,"i bet spiderman shipped he floor with him lol , sony bough the rights of spiderman fo 10 million i bet they regret not buying the rest ."
12103,"they thought the world would only care about spiderman . do n't get me wrong , spiderman is great , but i d like the others to ."
12104,"me too , i think the marvel universe has great heroes sand well movies has shown that to many ."
12105,"not to mention teh video grades . spiderman has great video games , especially for playstation ."
12106,"yeah i have a play station 4 and just purchase the latest game , its really good i liked it a lot . do you play video games ?"
12107,i play some . did you know that playstation 3 's are being used to study black holes ?
12108,"really ? i wonder how many if thom are being used , i did hear it was cheaper to gather play station 3s than to arm a supercomputer adn ther results were the dame"
12109,apparently they are very powerful computers . xbox 's are too . the are uses the controllers to fly uav spy planes .
12110,"rib ought an xbox when it first came out , it made a creepy sound when it was on stanely for too long ."
12111,"did it really ? tat 's weird ! i honestly do n't know which is better . playstations came out in 1994 and xbox came out in 2001 but they are both powerful , great game consoles ."
12112,"i think they are about the same , the only things that changes are the same some are exclusive to one brand ot the other ."
12113,and the fans of each . for xbox a guy spent 2600 dollars on a carnival the to win one .
12114,xbox or playstation ?
12115,personally i like the xbox better . it 's way that the first to came out back in 2010 lol k had one on launch day
12116,"me too , i love xbox , i great up with playstation tone go my first xbox 360 after ! can though it red binge , i still loved it !"
12117,"hurry up my xbox 360 las red winged , it 's crazy that it sold 77 million units even with that problem"
12118,"wow , i tried getting my free one but i missed th warranty by like 1 week !"
12119,that 's really annoying ! you have an xbox one by the way ? apparently it has been released in 21 markets and came out back in 2014
12120,"yep , an i will never look back at playstation ! event he army uses xbox controllers to fly uav spy planes !"
12121,well i bet they save a lot of money using xbox controllers instead of custom ones . it 's also crazy that quadriplegics have special controllers that they can play xbox 360 games witht
12122,"for sure , lol . that is awesome they look after everyone 's ability . have you heard of mikerowesoft . om ?"
12123,"ahha no ish ave n't what is that ? i just know that if you like the original xbox on too long that it stars to make weird noises on the dashboard , i remember those they were very strange"
12124,"so , e . made that website and sold the domain oi of court for a xbox and games . smart kid lol . i remember those also , scary in the middle of the night lol"
12125,haha that is crazy . you own a playstation by the way ? i 's crazy that the united states government pu together 100 playstation trees and built a supercomputer lol
12126,"i had a playstation 13 bum my 3 only for netflix . playstation 2 was awesome , tony hawk was my game !"
12127,"yeah playstation 2 is my favorite ! and speaking of playstation trees , apparently they were being used to research black holes because they were so powerful"
12128,"wow , that is awesome ! i never knew had . i used to play grand theft auto oj playstation 2 , did you play that ?"
12129,"i did play hat game . i played the one on playstation 2 though , not the original one , apparently if you ; ut hte original one into a cd player you could listen to a soundtrack which is awesome"
12130,"that would be awesome . i remember playing the first on pc but the overhead view kind of stinks . ps2 version was a , amzing !"
12131,"yep i agree ! i also played the video game spiderman for the sega dreamcast , and i think it 's weird that stay used a hyphen in the name spiderman so that he would ' the confused with superman , i don ' know why the would be confused though haha"
12132,"that is funny , i never knew that ol . it makes sense though . i loved spiderman for playstation too . it was nice chatting with you !"
12133,"thanks you too ! and yes stanley is the man , even his wife did the voice of madame web in the spiderman series back in 1994 which is good"
12134,wow that ie awesome ! enjoy your night !
12135,hi how are you ? do you play video games ?
12136,"i 'm doing well how are you ? yes i like playing video games , especially on xbox !"

12139,"microsoft gets many things wrong , but ive heard good things bout xbox games . i played games as a kid , bug now , im not interested . what games do you like ?"
12140,i like the call of duty games nad madden footbal games ! i think it 's cool they have controller for quadriplegics for xbox 346 !
12141,madden is fun . i played madden man many years ago . controllers for quadriplegics ? how do theyd that ?
12142,"i 'm not sure , probably using their mind or something ! the us army even uses xbox 360 controlelrsa to fly uav spy planes ! crazy !"
12143,those controllers are probably so well designs that anyone can learn them in five minutes . thats great ! now i want a uav spy plane of my own .
12144,it woudl be easy indeed ! are you into superhero hcaractersl ike spiderman ?
12145,i like spiderman . most of the shoes are not so interesting to me . do you like spidey ?
12146,i do ! i think it 's funny why spiderman has a hyphen in his name !
12147,"ye , i have thought about what . why ?"
12148,stan lee did n't want anybody to confuse him i superman ? i guess that 's smart ?
12149,"oh , ok . yeah , i could see that the selling would look similar . plus superman is dc and spidey is marvel ."
12150,can you believe what sony paid for the right to spiderman in 1998 ?
12151,they should have paid a lot for that character . he is quit valuable .
12152,i water how much money he has brought in for them ? i know playstation has many games about him since they are sony .
12153,"yeah , that would make esque . sony wants to use its ip for its own platforms as much as possible . anyway , great chat !"

12161,"that is insane , but i heard that is cost like 110 million , that is a ton of money"
12162,yeah pretty insane . do you know how they generated the raptors in the movie ?
12163,"yeah they had people get in suits and act , pretty cool considering everything is animated nowadays"
12164,yeah i know right ? it took them 6 hours though to make one frame for area in the brain all soaked up
12165,yeah that is a long time i guess that is why they opted for the suits for the raptors
12166,yeah good point . chrissy pratt joked about getting th head and then got it later on
12167,"haha smart guy , it worked pretty well for him i guess . did you see jumanji ?"

12206,have you seen jurassic were ; s : fallen kingdom ?
12207,no . no that how is it ?
12208,i saw it and it was pretty good . its the fifth installment of the jurassic park film series . have you seen all of them ?
12209,yes . i thought the first was the best ou tofu the 4 that i saw
12210,"that 's a classic for sure . do you know the primary sound used to create the trey roar was an elephant roar ? tat 's incredible , is n't it ?"
12211,yes . he had heard that . good jb on that
12212,"you know , despite its title , almost all the dinosaurs in jurassic park actually lived during the cretaceous period ."
12213,i didnt know that
12214,i guess jurassic park sounded jazz than crusty cretaceous park ? lol
12215,i agree . it dose not flow very well
12216,i suppose creative license to make it sound better to the ear . do you realize that the velociraptors were only waist high . an adult human ?
12217,yes i had read that somewhere .
12218,did you ever have one of those dino sized metals from mcdonads ' ?
12219,no . i have not been to mcdonald 's in a few years . i used to grab a big mac once i awhile
12220,"me either , i try to avoid the fast food route ."
12221,i prefer real meat if i am going to eat meat
12222,"lol , well i 's been nice chatting with you this lovely , fine florida afternoon . i got to go wash my cat k , if you know what i mean , i 'll talk to you later , friend ."
12223,hi there . have you heard of the razzie awards ? seems to award teh worst movies of the ear !
12224,yes i am very award of the craziest . i 've been shocked about some of the people that have won .
12225,yes i really lke mark wahlberg so was surprised to hear he got a double nomination .
12226,h has had for and bad performances . great in the separated and horrible in the happening .
12227,"yes very much agree . also not so good in daddy 's home 2 nad transformers , although i liked those movies ."
12228,i am not surprised that the area moves have even nominated .
12229,"no surprises there ! also the snowman , which looked like a cheesy horror film !"
12230,"it did look awful . since you mentioned transformers , did you know that in the 2007 film there are 1 . 53 explosions per minute ? !"
12231,wow that is a lot of explosions . i guess people really liken explosions because he movies ended up grossing over a billion n !
12232,that 's surprising when age of extinction did so well with a rotten tomatoes score of 15 percent .
12233,yes that is a terrible song indeed . optimus prime has died more than 25 times in the last 30 years . he 's got more lives ahah a cast .
12234,wow ! that seems very excessive .
12235,yes it does . michael bay was seen in the first film . he was eh human flicked away by megatron .
12236,i did not notice that . apparently the cgi in them nice was very complicated . one frame of movement took 38 hours to render !
12237,that is so much work . do you like otehr action movies like jurassic world ? i loved jurassic park so was hesitant when they announced jurassic world .
12238,i liked jurassic world but not it 's sequel fallen kingdom .
12239,yeah i liked them both but not fallen kingdom as much . chris pratt is one of my favorite actors and he actually once joked bout being in jurassic park in 2010 . glad it worked out for him .
12240,that is funny . did you know that the movie cost 6 millions to make but hte ride cost 110 million ?
12241,wow tha win hard to believe although i have been on the rode an it is so much fun . the dinosaurs in jurassic park only appear in the film for 15 minutes surprisingly . it was nice talking with you today .
12242,i had no idea they were in i so little . they had a big impact . it was nic talking to you as well .
12243,"ha . good one and watch out for those dinosaurs : ,"
12244,hey there did you ever watch the tv show transformers in the 80s ?
12245,"of course , who did n't ? the original show ?"
12246,"yes i hatch the cartoon wand als some of the movies . i really like the action , an only like the first movie . what about you"
12247,the first movie released by bay ?
12248,"that 's a good ; it , yes i saw that movie ans silo the original animated movie , i liked both of those movies nut the reset were horrible lol"
12249,"yeah , they were . they all totally were not good ."
12250,"i agree with you . michael bay is an ok director bough , he directed the movie the rock which is really good ."
12251,"yeah , the rock is a great movie , are you kidding me ? ' welcome to the rock ! '"
12252,lol i 'm glad you know what that movie is ! it 's a very different movie from the 70s transformers movie which had oneandahalf explosions per minute pparnetly
12253,"yeah , well , i liked he original cartoon transformers , to be honest ."
12254,"yes the cartoon was the best . even though the lion section movies to 38 hours to render bust one frame , because they wheres o complicated , they still did n't impress me"
12255,"is that true ? i think that might be an exaggeration , right ?"
12256,"no i do think that 's true on another movies not , why did you think of jurassic world fallen kingdom ? i thought it was horrible ; e"
12257,"i have n't seen it , but i 'll take your word for it ."
12258,"hte original jurassic park is the best , even though the dinosaurs in it only appear for about 15 minutes"
12259,"yeah , i thought it wash did too . does this one have goldblum ?"
12260,yes it does for only a couple sales . but it 's honestly not worth seeing the movie just for him .
12261,"no , it 's not . he 's no thay art of an actor to be honest ."
12262,"i agree wit hyou . i do like chris pratt though . i guess he joked witht steven spielberg about being the dead in jurassic park four back in 2010 , how right he was lol"
12263,"they got up to 4 ? omg , where have i been ?"
12264,well they did the remake which i guess counts as four lol . trust me you 're not missing anything
12265,"ive always like costumes , i love halloween because of that , what about you ?"
12266,halloween is do . i never got into it . do you go all out for it ?
12267,"i do , e very yea r and costume , you know panda researchers wear a panda costume for dirk ."
12268,i did not know that . makes sense but i would not wear it during mating season . . . . that might be scary !
12269,"if would be scary indeed lol , do you know who john depp is ?"
12270,"i do he spends a ton of money on wine every monty , like 10 ."
12271,"thats a l , ot of money for sure ! well he dresses up in hack sparrow costumes nad visits sick kids at hospitals , i think thats admirable ."
12272,so cure . althought that character might be a little scary for some i . . . i 'm sure he does great with it though . . .
12273,"i get your point , might be really scary fdr some kids , you now sean bean from lord of the kind is actually scared of heights ."
12274,"i did read that he hiked instead , flying . seems like a waste of time . just sedated him and take it ."
12275,"i know right lol , that would be a fun approach noway do you like the gucci ronald ?"
12276,not really as i am not into status or prestige items . do you know anything about the that might change my mind ?
12277,"not really , i do know some interesting facts bout he brand do you want to know one ?"
12278,"yes , please !"
12279,"ok so rick harrison actually dropped out o school to sel fake gucci bags , he earned about 2000 a week from that ,"
12280,"wow , that a lot of money for fake bags . whoo 's rick harrison ?"
12281,"hi sa businessman , and really tv personality have you watched pawn stars ?"
12282,i have . . . that 's rick harrison ? ? ? ? did n't chump get busted for drugs ?
12283,"he did ? there was always so , something off with chump ll the founder of gucci wwf called guccio gucci ."
12284,taunts a unique name . . . chump was weird . i only saw like 4 episodes . . .
12285,"it is , it has an italian pronunciation and gucci was founded in 1998 . i used to like the pawn shop becuase of al ; the history and facts you discovered in the show ."
12286,the razzie awards are an interesting award show . hav eyou seen it ?
12287,"i havent heard of them until recently . i think it 's a funny concept , to poke fun at some of hollywood 's worst productions , but i fee nba for the nominees ! have you seen them ?"
12288,"i have only read about them , but i have definitely seen some horrible movies . ."
12289,"j have too ! ahve you seen the room ? it 's my favorite terrible movie , htey actually made a movie about its cult ufo ; flowing called disaster artist with tommy wise . have you heard of this ? that definitely deserves a razzie award"
12290,"i have not seen it ! he mummy was another awful movie , but my fall time favorite was attack of thye killer tomatoes from the 90s"
12291,"i have heard of the mummy but never saw it , what is attack of the killer tomatoes about ?"
12292,it is literally giant tomatoes invading earth . it is horribly bad ! another movie called mother ! got some razzie awards
12293,"that 's hilarious . yeah , thats stars jennifer lawrence rights ? did you know razzie put tyler perry in the worst actresses category for his made movies ?"
12294,that is funny about the worst actresses . i wonder if samberg has ever had a nomination or
12295,"yeah i have n't seen those movies but i heard they were just awful . another hilarious add one is called robber , it 's a horror movie . have you seen or heard of it ? it deserves a rake for sure ."
12296,i have never seen rubber . i have seen the movie the snowman that is a vastly movie .
12297,rubber is about a killer tire that comes to life . i came out in 2011 i think . what is the snowman bout ?
12298,it ws shot adn released with a lot of missing footage . 1015 percent of thas screenplay nwas never shoe !
12299,"that 's crazy ! did they just not made enough hime to shoot ? i think that 's by thomas alfredson , no ? he 's had some decent movies before"
12300,yesh e has . i think the best was when adam sandler was dominated for both east actress and actor in the same film !
12301,that 's so funny ! how is that even possible ? is that from jack ana fill .
12302,yes on jack and will where he played opposite sex fraternal twins
12303,"that 's so funny . good for adam sandler , but i guess he alas n't very good in it ."
12304,yes i was apparently note he best film . but tyler perry ha seen nominated for best actress a whole bunch of times
12305,"i 'm not sure how i feel about that . if it was best female character , he maybe , but he 's not an actress , he 's an actor . seems a little trawnsphobic to me , but maybe that 's just me ?"
12306,yeah it is definitely a bit odd .
12307,do you wear a costume for halloween ever ?
12308,my mom and dad user to dress me up in costumes for halloween sometimes . how about you ?
12309,"lol me too , 9 remember seeing pictures of some ridiculous costumes . i want to be a panda researcher though"

12313,"that is true lol , 9 think it would look so cool , b ut maybe not the more i think bout it lol . tell you one trying though , johnny depp dresses as jack sparrow and goes to hospitals to cher sick kids up"
12314,"he os a great guy for doing that for the kids . other stars sometimes do that , but he is probably popular with the youngsters ."
12315,"for sure , who does n't make pirates of the caribbean ! do you ever dress i gucci clothing ?"
12316,i do not . i can not afford the gucci . but it sure looks cool . do you have the gucci ?
12317,"i annoy either , i have some fake gucci bet , i just tell people they are real , they do n't know any difference !"
12318,i wouldnt know the difference either . i do not kno fashion . i should learn and become more fashionable .
12319,"me good , lol . did you know the creator of gucci was named guccio tucci ?"
12320,that is a silly sounding name ? gucci oguchi ? it wounds irish !
12321,"ha i sounds something , but i bet it os italian or something like that lol . you can make good money selling fake gucci , some guy started a 2000 dollar a wee business doing it"
12322,"that sounds much better than , say , doing online chatting for cash . i would get into the fake gucci . give myself the name gucci o'ghfci ."
12323,"lol , that is a good start to a successful business . have rick harrison from pawn stars get you started lol !"
12324,"yes , a pawn broken probably knows the value of things pretty well . he will know how to price fake goods . that is a good tip . thanks ."
12325,"that is a good point , it was so nice chatting on you , i think we have a nice business plan !"
12326,nice chatting with you ! it 8 sa perfect plan . we can not fail .

12333,"yup that is crazy , also crazy is in the 2007 movie there are about 1 . 5 explosions per minute , thats insane"
12334,that sure is . optimus prime dies more than 25 times over 30 years
12335,"ya thats al ot haha , that includes all the comics , cartoons , and movies , etc , its amazing they keep bringing him back"
12336,"that sure is a lot , that guys is indestructible ; e indeed"

12392,did you play with legos growing up ?
12393,"i did play with legos , my favorite , what about you ?"
12394,me too ! i think its really cool that if all the lego bricks produced were shared out equally every single person non earth would own 86 lego bricks .
12395,"86 bricks per person , wow that is a lot of palsatic , too much fo sour environment to handle"
12396,i am wondering if they have had a lot o back cash for the plastic usage ?
12397,"they must cause a lot of contamination that is a sure thing , i did leg is investing millions to make sure their new pieces are safe for the environment"
12398,i think thats a great idea to ditch their oilbased plastics in search of environmentally friendly alternatives .
12399,"i think its a great idea as well , making their product safer for te environment , did you hear about that german graffiti artist , the one that painted a bridge and made it look like it was made out of legos"
12400,i want to se a picture of hat ! i a sure it attracts a lot of tourists .
12401,"it must get , hopefully the city didnt was his work of art ,"
12402,i had no idea that they replaced ferrari as brand finance 's world 's most powerful brand .
12403,"wow , thats a huge step up , there is a 14 karat gold lego given o employees back in the 80s"
12404,"they are valued at nearly 15 , 000 . that is a expensive lego ."
12405,"that is really expensive i agree , did you watch the lego batman movie ?"
12406,id id not . did you ?
12407,"i watched it , batman is my favorite hero , t he dark knight , such a great hero"
12408,did you know that there was a batman villain named condiment king ?
12409,"i didnt know that , that re his powers lol ,"
12410,"nor sure but he was defeated by sipping on his own , ketchup ."
12411,"sounds like his powers were his own kryptonite after ll , do you know who adam west is ?"
12412,"yes , it is funny that the logo is on his molar ."
12413,"yeah the same one , he must be a big fan lol"
12414,that is a commitment . too bad not many people will even see it .
12415,"yeah its well hidden , i a tough spot ,"
12416,i do n't understand how netflix an hae 150 movies with a 100 percent rotten tomato rating . perhaps they are movies no one has bothered to watch . have you ever seen a movie with a 100 percent rating ?
12417,"no , i havent ' . 100 percent for anything subjective is crazy . i wil say that my husband sill agreed with the 38 percent score for michael bay . lol"
12418,"haha . i have a feeling hat kids are doing over the world . spy kids at 93 percent ? i remember i liked it , but i do n't remember it ewing an ar acting . also it 's hilarious that legos replaced ferrari a brand finances world 's most powerful brand . maybe there companies are targeting children as their next target audience ?"
12419,"i would say these companies are really smart . the brands nor only target children but all ages . are a ferrari can only be used by adults , legos can be used and reused by people of all ages and can be recondtrucgted into different shes . and man i wish i worked for lego and go one of those golden bricks did you hear about tha t ?"
12420,"i did n't hear about that . that 's crazy . i think it 's cool that they care about the people that ave invested time into their company . lego is dope . they are infiltrating everything ? movies , amusement parts , living room floors . also it 's cool how hey partner witht however owns he rights to batman . seems liek a legit company but its weird that rotten tomatoes gives certain movies swede high drawings while other historical informative movies get a lot rating . like i understand that it ' a boring , but dam n ."
12421,"i think it crazy how far of these large companies or websites started . take rotten tomatoes , i remember it from high school it was in its infantry and to think it was created by 3 undergrad college kids . the concept id so simple but so great . i now as a young adult i did n't want to have to rely on th elder critics for mover reviews to decide if i wanted to see a movie , bu alike you said with spykids getting a higher rating the the almighty batman i 'm not so sure about all the scores on this website either lol ."
12422,"oh . that makes sense . if if was us rating the movie at a young age e , then it woudl get a higher rating than the abraham lincoln movie . makes sense . because of the internet , anyone is allowed to place their opinion on curtains subjects ? democracy ."
12423,"speaking of batman , he is my favorite superhero ! ! he appeared in the 27 detective comics in 1939 . what i so great about batman is tha the does n't have powers , but is quite strength and genius intellect ."
12424,they have come a long way . they 've created tons of dc movies . so is batman is the sam universe as aquaman ? like how everyone in marvel is now in one movie . . . ' that the same thing ? i wonder if there is a connection witht ego he batman . i know that marvel does't own spiderman and ha stop nwas the rights in order to make the movie . . . . the are so many different spiderman .
12425,i 'm not sure if they are in the same universe all of that is so convoluted . i actually did n't get into the comics like that but i do know dc is trying to create the site type of universe as marvel but its not quite working out . batman had a hilarious villain though he had been called condiment king and he was defeated by slipping on his own ketchup .
12426,"true . i know that marvel is owned by disney so they have their stuff together . yeah , i kin for feel bad for dc comics but if they stick with put hopefully they can build a strong team . that 's hilarious . and relaly weird and creative and i honestly would love to see that more into a movie . especially because i feel like my generation is into weird stuff ."
12427,i take it you are a millennial i remember growing up with all of the cartoons in the morning on saturdays and in the afternoon after school so there is definitely a market for batman and i 'm still one back to the rating on rotten tomato for the movie i can not believe that it was n't like an a rating . adam west even has a batman logo on one of his molars how awesome is tha t ?
12428,i m . same . i always check rotten tomatoes and if its a sport then i 'm not wasting my time . sometimes i read stuff by critics and i 'm like . . . your the worst . also in film school everyone says the same crap and its annoying . yes bugs bunny is the best . i remember watching the one where they 're like . . . children funnies . . i do n't kno wb thats crazy dedication to adam west ! have you seen the one with ben affleck ?
12429,"no , i refuse to watch it i 'm on some weird strike . hahhahaha i need to see it just so i can have an intelligent argument . i really like the christian bale i thought he was a great batman but from what i hear be affleck day a great rule wayne . i can not wait to see the new joker by joaquin phoenix i what to see if the saying holds true thati ace to face batman and joker never mention each other by name ."
12430,"hahaha . i totally understand . tbh i do n't remember anything special about it . i also dont remember the plot which is crazy because . . . . should they all have the lame plot . yeah i only remember can because i highly love tom hardy . terrible , i know . oh wow joan should be bomb . hes a great actor . i wonder if there is a significance to them not calling zach otter by name . i wonder i she lego batman movie got a good rotten tomatoes rating . i bet you it did . i hope i create something one day as successful as the three undergraduate students . are they all asian ? of course . i 'm only part asia so . . . not looking great ."
12431,yes i wish i came up with something like that as well . he eyou aware that weird al uankovic did some voiceover world on the most recent animated batman vs robin
12432,"sure did . from factual fictional 3 . before that , i did not , do you think he started s a voice actor then became famous after or vic versa ?"
12433,you know it could ' surprise me if that was the way t happened win teh different songs ne comes up with .
12434,"he surely is animated . haha . . . it 's too late . i like that lego is trying to do away with plastic . like how batman tries to do away with crime . wow , i am really reaching now ."
12435,"yes , doing away with plastic is a great strategy for lego to roman reliant and reduce their impact on the earth . that is all the rage these days lol ."
12436,sure is ! save the planet !
12437,i love reading rotten tomatoes . especially since they tell it like it is for michael bay ' movies .
12438,"i know ! i just rotten tomatoes as well , usually they give accurate reviews specially with netflix movies ."
12439,did you know t was owned by warner bros ? that is surprising since they i doubt gave some movies with poor reviews on it .
12440,"i didnt know that ! and i guess its unbiased , that tells you a lot about the service ."
12441,i guess they ca n't control what people have to say . you video game based movie has ever gotten about 44 percent mortal format as pretty good i 'd give it a much higher rating .
12442,"i gues come people dont ike the franchise , i love to play mortal kombat games but i am more of a batman fan ."
12443,i like batman too . i oz know weird l did some voice work in batman vs robin ?
12444,"i didnt know that , i think the most amazing aspect of batman is that he doesnt have superpowers ."
12445,"yes , he 's just smartest hen all the bas guys . it also doesnt ' hurt that he is rich and has the money to develop all kinds of technology ."
12446,"yeah , i agree , not everything is powers an alfred is a badass as well ."
12447,robin is underrated too . i wish there were more robin lego sets .
12448,"i know , i wish that too so you are a lego fan ?"
12449,yes ! i love lego even though my last set name with a defective piece . the odds are so slim since only 18 out of every million are defective e .
12450,"that re som crazy odds , did you file a complaint ? i think its great how lego is pitching heir oil based plastics and seeking envrnemental friendly options ."
12451,"no i did n't complain , . it 's the first time it 's happened . ; i have some of my parents had lego and the pieces from 1958 still fit with todays ! i am glad they are switching the plastic finally ."
12452,did you hear about the german graffiti artist tat made a bridge look like it was made out of legos ?
12453,i saw pictures of it . it would have been neat to see . 250 square meters ! that 's massive .
12454,"yeah i know , i wonder if they painted over his artwork , i think it would be great just to leave it there ."
12455,what a shame . when we are done talking i stick i 'll go play a star wars lego game .
12456,"ish havent played that game , i might buy it i liked the lego batman game l"
12457,you should go get it now . i 'm off to play . bye !
12458,"bye , have a nice day"
12459,o you thinker gotten tomatoes is a good site for reviews
12460,i do n't know . i read to shy away from reviews da although netflix had almost 150 reviews on there with a 200 percent rating .
12461,"ca n movie get a 100 percent rating i can only think of one or two , the company is owned by warner bars"
12462,"if it was myself doing the ratings , i wold be hard to give any movie a 100 percent review . morning in the world is 100 perfect except maybe ur kids ll , ol spykids received a 93 percent on the ."
12463,"i though spykids was a great movie , but 93 percent sees really excesive lol"
12464,yes ! no video game on there has ever achieved higher than a 44 percent rating .
12465,do you like legos ? did you ever play with them as a child or eve plate ?
12466,"id id ! i think that 's like epa write of passage for all children to play with legos . there are so many legos that if they were divided outta o every person on earth , each person would ow 86 lego bricks !"
12467,8 6beicsk per person no kidding ! its s good thing the company is replacing their oilbased plastics and searching for a friendlier alternative to the environment
12468,yes ! i agree . as of july 2015 600 billion lago parts phd been produced . that 's a lot of plastic !
12469,"a lot of plastic and a big impact to the environment , di do hear about that graffiti artist , the one that painted a lego bridge ?"
12470,i did n't until you just told me ! legos replaced ferrari as the worlds most powerful brand in 2015 .
12471,"i guess every kid likes to play with legos , do you like batman ? he is my favorite hero"
12472,i do ! hard to believe he originally appeared in a comic book in 1939 !
12473,"yeah it was c comics 27 comic book , the dark knight what a great name and story , a hero without powers"
12474,yes ! bartman ? s gotham city is located in new jersey according to dc and .
12475,"that major must be worth a ot of money the lol , there was a villain named condiment king , funny how he was defeated"
12476,lol did he slip on his own ketchup by any chance ?
12477,"yeah he did lol , thats how eh was defeated ,"
12478,funny stuff ! did you know hat adam west has a batman logo on one of his molars ?
12479,"i bet the joker laughed at the condiment king , and no i didnt know that about adam west"
12480,"hey ! did you see wonder woman when it came out , or since hen , ?"
12481,i have not seen the new ww movie . have you ?
12482,i did see it . k 'm not a big fan of superhero movies in general but i wanted to support movies is female superhero leads
12483,"yeah , that ie a good idea . i figure that women heroes need to be more visible . i usually dont watch those movies because the explosions wand battle scenes gist dull ."
12484,thats ' exactly how i felt when i watched it . an log course the compulsory heteroromantic subplot felt so aboriginal
12485,"well , it is showbusiness . the products want to make money and they go with the safe bets . younger audiences are probably more opine to new plot lines ."
12486,"yeah . i hear the news cap ; train marvel ha snow love story , which makes e more likely to see i t , honestly ."
12487,"yeah , i prefer something other than simple love stories , especially in super he films ."
12488,"i 'd also like to see older superheroes ; i do n't mean like robert downey jr . , but more like denzel washington who at least has grey in his hair ."
12489,"yeah , he genre has the potential to appeal to wide audiences if the stories and stars have enough variety ."
12490,although i 'll never get tired of leo dicaprio in anything . hopefully he 'll ; eb in the twilight zone movie he 's producing
12491,is he ? i did not know that . e is a gifted actor . i enjoy his work immensely .
12492,"i fee 'the she way . i 'm glad he finally won an oscar . before that , his only major award was a golfer globe from 2004"
12493,"he has been overlooked for too long , but many other big same get the cold shoulder fm hollywood . too political ."
12494,"yeah , that 's probably guy . a , lso , he apparently was hanging onto maroon brandon 's oscar award and picasso painting that he had to surrender to the us govt . maybe he was blacklisted from receiving awards over that ? lol"
12495,"that is odd . i think that some people end up on a black list , like richard gerge ."
12496,"what happened with him ? was it the hamster thing , the buedhist thing , or something else ?"
12497,"yeah , he made a comment about tinder nad the dali haha or something . that is a big bo no . he will never be back ."
12498,was that after 9 or 11 whine he aide everyone should forgive and forget o nwas thai something more recent ? i vaguely recall something recently happening
12499,"i dont re , member . hollywood has a political linear nd stars have to stick o i . anyway . , get chat !"
12500,"wish , i guess there 's pressure to be liberal or progressive . nice chat as well : ,"
12501,"hi there , do yiu enjoy watching movies ?"
12502,"i do like watching movies . i saw wonder woman recently , did you se it ? what did you think"
12503,"i loved it and looking forward to the sequel . seems gadot was a real fighter , she was in israeli defense forces"
12504,"yeah i could see that . she did a good job with acting like she was a soldier and such . its ' funny that he she auditioned , she thought she as auditioning for catwoman , that 's a completely different roe"
12505,hahaha o figure . do you know what the role of wonder woman was when the character first appeared ?
12506,"no i do n't know ? can you tell me ? . what so youth think bout would war 1 movies ? i do n't think they are enough , and the wonder woman movie is apparently the highest grossing one"
12507,"we , l they aide her the secretary , ho cliche . and yeah now it is one of the highest grossing movies"
12508,"yep that 's true . and yeah , amzing her the secretary would definitely not fly today haha . what of you think about leonardo dicaprio by they way ? i really hiked him in titanic"
12509,i like him he is a good actor . he is apparently producing a twilight zone movie
12510,that is interesting i did n't know that . i hope that movie is good . have you ever seen hte sitcom growing pink ? apparently brad pitt matthew perry and asl leonardo dicaprio were in it at some point
12511,"oh no i have not seen that one . despite his great work , he has only won one golden globe in his life"
12512,"yeah that is crazy . he 's actually a good actor in my opinion , have you seen the movie the reenact ? i did n't know that it was a remake of a 1971 movie"
12513,yeah it was actually a remake of the movie man in the wilderness . i liked it a lot
12514,"yep you 're right . it was definitely ; y an interesting movie . have you ever seen the movie the basketball aviaries ? i heard it was good , but it definitely helped launch his career apparently"
12515,"ish ave not seen that one actually , maybe i should check it out . how about denzel washington , what do you think of him ?"
12516,"yeah he seems like a pretty good guy . i know that he played this actor ' grades ' in the fruit of the moon , m commercials lol i do n't think i 've seen those"
12517,"i have not seen those they , wow . and he has never done a sequel to any of his movies it seems"
12518,that is interestin 3 and his family is really talented by the way too . his son plays for the st louis rams . what a family
12519,"nicole , did not know that . and the guy refused to pay to get a star in the hollywood walk of fame"
12520,"that is pretty funny . it must be out of principle because they definitely have the moeny , only 0 , 000 , i guess they just do n't want to support it perhaps ? what do you think"
12521,i honestly like their stan on this . they have made great careers why would they need a star . nice chatting with you .
12522,did you know that the library of congress has a national soo festival ? do you think hey have comic books there like wonder woman ?
12523,"no i did n't know that . brad metzler is a great author though , he has some work a 'the congress national book festival such as history decode"
12524,"one book i really liked reading was body of lies bey david ignatius . i saw the movie made abut it , too . did you ?"
12525,i saw the movie . it has leonardo dicaprio i think it was directed by ridley scott . i actually like hat movie a lot . did you see the movie wonder woman by the way
12526,"yes ! wonder woman was a great movie . i liked the graphics in it and the actress herself was read . she just have used stunt doubles , though ?"
12527,no i do n't think so . she was actually in the israeli army so it would n't surprise me if she did all of her own stunts
12528,shes ' even cooler than i thought ! i heard that when she auditioned she thought it was for cat woman instead of wonders roman !
12529,thats ' crazy because those are entirely different rolls ! amazing that wonder woman is the highest grossing superhero movies and also the highest grossing world war 1 movie !
12530,did you know taht wonder woman started out in the group of the justice society as a lowly secretary ?
12531,i think that came our back in 1941 right ? oh wow how the times have changed that would not fly today
12532,"i wonder if she was their first secretary ? also , if wonder woman is an amazon , how can her fingers fit o a normal typewriter ?"
12533,"that is a grea question ! waht was interesting to me to was that in 2017 there were a lot of female lead movies , they were the top three highest grossing movies for that year"
12534,that is very interesting ! i like how ponder woman hs a bunch of powers that let her fight almost like a mortal kombat character .
12535,"that is really crazy ! speaking of actors and actresses , what do you think about leonardo dicaprio ? hes in some of my favorite movies alike tha separated"
12536,"yea h , leo i great . i hear he was in that sitcom called growing paints but i did n't catch it . what 's eating gilbert grape was a good one he was in , too ."
12537,yes i liek both the movies . i also like the movie blood diamond . it you know that you was in an 80s sitcom back in the day ?
12538,do you think leo or denzel washington have won more awards ? he was god in the movie training day . did you catch that one ?
12539,"i did see that one . i be tthat denzel actually won more awards , i guess he used to play the character grades in fruit of the moon commercials which is funny to think about now"
12540,"i guess it was a good move for denzel . you got ta start out small , but it is surprising to know he started out , i any kid in a school play as a little cute fruit !"
12541,"lol you 're right ! , it 's impressive that denzel son actually plays for the st . louis rams , talk about a talented family"
12542,"very talented ! enough to have a say ron teh hollywood walk of fame . too bad denzel does n't say for his , though . snoop dogg also has a football playing son ."
12543,"have you seen the latest wonder woman , 2017 , movie ?"
12544,not yet but i 've heard wonder roman was one of the best one movies released
12545,i heard in as good too . i guess it was directed by a woman named patty jenkins from a screen play by allan herzberg .
12546,"heat ut 's interesting wonder woman is set during wwi , most movies avoid thati ie period"
12547,"tru . i guess gal gadot did a great job . makes sense , she knows war having served in idk for two years ."
12548,"yea , it 's interesting that wonder woman is they highest grossing wwi movie in box office history"
12549,wa i and wonder woman first appeared in 1941 the beginning of ww ii for america ? wonde why ?
12550,wonder woman also appeared as a member of justine society in 1941 too
12551,do you like leonardo dicaprio ? he got his start in the 1980 's sitcom growing pants . . .
12552,"yea , so is age at actor , i never knew his film debut wa sin critters 3"
12553,i did n't either . the work is that he 's producing a twilight zone movie .
12554,hopefully it 's pretty scary . sounds like it will be good i also is in the new twilight zone movie
12555,i always like the the . did you see the movie the reenact ? it was a 1971 film of wi ; deepest survival . video did a great job .
12556,"the reenact was pretty good , glad leo won an oscar for t"
12557,how about denzel washington ? funny that he has never dome a sequel 5o one of his movies .
12558,"yea denzel is another amazing actor , funny that he used to do fruit of the moon commercials"
12559,"yeah . have you ever heard of hte library of congress ' national books festival ? i guess they celebrate books such as ' the inner circle ' , ' the switch ' and even comic books like ' spinning ' , graphic novel , ."
12560,"very little , i know brad metzler wrote ' the inner circle '"
12561,the festival has old kinds of books including fantasy novels . another tyrant became a movie is ' the bone collector ' . it sounds interesting .
12562,"yea , i heard theuy covered the book turned movie ' body of lies '"
12563,"i have n't heard of that one . well , hanks for the chat !"
12564,good morning ! have you heard of stan lee ? did you know taht he did games in all of the marvel movies ?
12565,i have ! eh was such a good writer ! i love looking for high in his films !
12566,"i do too and i agree , he wa sa god writer . sometimes he even speaks , like in captain america , the winter soldier ."
12567,i did n't know hat ! what else was he in ?
12568,my favorites are the iron an appearances . it seems like h chad fun with those because i dont only stark thinks h 's hugh jenner and in another set thinks he 's larry king !
12569,that is so cool ! i 'll have to look those up ! i think i remember something about spiderman getting married . do you ?
12570,no i do n't . did he get arrived in one of the movies ?
12571,"i think so . thye original spiderman atm arrived to mary jane . 1987 i think ? they did a whole public thing from it if i re , member right ."
12572,well that 's god . i use to be a fan of spider man back in the day and him marrying her is good ! oh ! that makes me think of san lee 's cameo in one of he movies . he 's standing on a street with peter parker and tells him tthat one man can make a difference ! how cool is that ?
12573,"that is very cool ! i liked stan lee . i think the first spiderman made stab see something like 800 billion in revenue , but he didn ' 6 get any of it !"
12574,"that 's so unfair ! he created something important . i mean , the military is even trying to achieve spider man like abilities ."
12575,would n't that be something to see ! have you seen thor ? i tried to watch it but had a hard time following it .
12576,"i have see thor and i really liked it . i was impressed with teh cast , especially taht anthony hopkins was in it ."
12577,"was ? i guess i did n't watch it long enough how that ! tom hiddleston tried out for the , instead he got loki ."
12578,i 've heard that before . i heard he had to put on 50 pounds of muscle too .
12579,i ca n't even imagine working that hard for a role and not getting it ! i did watch ironman all the way thru . how bout you ?
12580,in ot only watched all the say through but watched all iron man movies . i thought robert downey jr . did an outstanding job !
12581,i thought so too ! i did think he has a little too skinny for the role though ! he is so small ! genytu paltrow was amazing too . what was her name in it ? apple or something ?
12582,i did n't noticed . i do n't rememebr her name but she did do good . he whole iron man story is so cool . a super rich guy that is intelligent and builds things and becomes a yeah ? !
12583,and he does it work everyone else too ! i 'm believe the firs timon man came out almost 11 years ago !
12584,o know ! it seems like it was just a few months ago ! i did sort of hate to see jeff bridges as the bad guy .
12585,as as sad to see stan lee passed away . the marvel movies jsut wont ' feel right without his cameos .
12586,"i know the feeling , it wont be same without him , one of my favorites is the one in the winter soldier , so funny ! !"
12587,"i think my alltime favorite was his amazing spiderman appearance , where he was wearing but headphones as everything explode behind him"
12588,"that was a good one s well , or the one when he drink a cup of a drink and harsh pulls blood in it ."
12589,"that one is such a visceral memory for me , because he makes such a memorable sound when he tastes teh kick ton is bottle . he really knew how to set up the brand !"
12590,"he sure did , my favorite hero is iron man i loved it ever since 2008 i think robert downey jr ia a great actor ."
12591,"oh yes , the iron man movies really launched the marvel cinematic universe into what it is today . my personal favorite dint he films is thor i think ."
12592,"tho rest a great character as well , did you know 80 percent of the dialogue in thor ragnarok was improvised ?"
12593,"that 's incredible , because i completely love how it turned out . i just learned that ton hiddleston who plays loki was originally screen testing to play thor , but i think chris hemsworth really nailed the character ."
12594,"he did and tom hiddleston really nailed the loki character as well , i think loki stole the movie adn the protagonist ."
12595,"he really did , which is so true to teh comics . they first choir by kenneth branagh just did n't use the support characters enough . thor was never meant to be only about thor , but his whole team of characters ."
12596,"i have n't seen those , but yeah , i'ts too bad spiderman mcvies have n't had a continuity but they kept oj pulling new actors for the roll ."
12597,marvel has always had a lot wrapped up in the spiderman character as their flagship for their younger audience . i 'm not surprised their movies are all over the place too .
12598,did you know the military is trying to emulate spiderman abilities for tshirt soldiers ?
12599,no that 's crazy . the sound alike another marvel gimmick honestly . they created a shoe stunts eddie with actors when they married off the character in the us .
12600,"could be , sounds really difficult to alter humans to have similar abilities as spiderman , it can be really dangerous , and i didnt hear about the 80s stunt , caa 'you tele like a bit more ?"
12601,"just that they pretended to marry eater parker off to mary jan line the real world and let and lee affiliate . there he is an , knowing just how to create a wild brand stunt ."
12602,"oh i see , interesting , and yeah , 8 see your point that definately sells movie for at least creates interest in them ."
12603,"the fact that he was so wellknown an considered a comic legend just shows how effective he was at those spots . before it man was released in 2008 , many people did n't even realize comics were stir , l being published ."
12604,i can imagine after all the whole marvel franchise is live because of him and will keep on lavigne lone after his death .
12605,he really gave team the right boost to start !
12606,"hello , do you like superhero movies ?"
12607,yes 9 hatch super hero movies all the time
12608,"nice . have you seen spiderman , any of them"
12609,yes i 've seen the first spiderman movie in 2002 where stan lee made a cameo where he saved a little girl who a building exploded .
12610,nice . did you know the us military is trying to replicate the abilities of spiderman ?
12611,in ever knee what . are they going to have soldiers bitten by radioactive spiders to gives hem super abilities ?
12612,i guess we will have to wait and see how that whole plan that they seem to have develops
12613,have you watched any of the thor movies ?
12614,"i have actually , the 2011 one . did you know antenna made the debut in horn ?"
12615,wow i never knew that tubman was in the the movie . i do remember that idris elba played one of the gods in it and a bunch of white supremacist were upset a black ma unplayed the part .
12616,"yeah apparently antman was in other superhero movies like spiderman , hulk adn ironman ."
12617,did antman play in hte first ironman movie ? the same movie that jeff bridges was in ?
12618,"i am not sure even which one he played in , i just ot have been paying attention . dud you know tom hiddleston originally auditioned for hte role koi thor and not loki"
12619,thats ' amazing . i never knew that . i do n't think he was good for that part . i recall that the odin 's ravens from the thor movie was i nthe avengers moved when thor and loki were arguing on the mountain top .
12620,yeah and he even went on to gain 50 pounds of muscle to make sure that he is set for the role of thor
12621,scan lee made a cameo in thor : the dark world . he was trying to get into a party if i recall .
12622,the ma nwas a legend for sure . he got 10 percent of all profits on his characters
12623,yeah e di lots o tours around rye country going to comic conventions . he died recently at the age of 95 .
12624,"yeah , he had a real career . do you know who performed the opening of spiderman back in 1990 ?"
12625,"spiderman in 1990 ? that is a bit before my it . was it made b the same studio that makes them now ? i do know that in the mid 90s jame cameron was supposed to make a spider , ana film with arnold schwarzenegger and leonardo dicaprio . it got cancelled though ."
12626,"maybe i am not sure but the singer was joe perry , lead guitarist of aerosmith . it was nice chatting with you : ,"
12627,"hi , how are you ?"
12628,good and you ? waht do you think of spider man ? i 've heard the first movie made over 800 6million dollars .
12629,i am well . i like spider man . i also like the xmen . do you ?
12630,i do like xmen . spider man is actually becoming kind of realistic in a way . the u . s . military is attempting to copy or of his abilities .
12631,the re dad blue suit would be weird dont he seas tough . . . i would draw the line there .
12632,"i would too ! i think i would rather wear an iron we suit , or exoskeleton as it 's called ."
12633,or have telekinetic powers ike some they characters .
12634,that could be great too . it could be good to have the weapons they have like thor 's hammer or the infinity gauntlet .
12635,i woudl like captain america 's power and just have the ripped body and upper strength . not too assuming but bad a .
12636,the would be nice . in real live i guess people do n't you like that . the guy that played loki in thor ha do gain 50 pounds of muscle .
12637,really ? i seemed so slight in the movie . how much did he weigh before ?
12638,"i do n't know and i agree with you . he did look thin . i guess maybe chris hemsworth , thor in th movie , was really big in comparison ."
12639,stan lee gets 1 7percent of ll net profits based on his characters ? he died a ric human !
12640,"i imagine that he did at that ! his movie are hugely popular , so much to that the best of actors work in the . look at anthony hopkins acting in thor !"
12641,did you know that dr octopus swapped consciousness oh spiderman ?
12642,i never knew that ! i wonder what happened to spiderman by dogs it .
12643,not sure . but it is dr aoc in thye superior spider man series . weird . . .
12644,that is weird . maybe the writers left it for spider man to become a bad guy . stan lee probably had something in mind . i always liked him . i especially like hat he had cameo roles in all of hi movies .
12645,i always go into the movies looking forth im . always fun to see her they put him .
12646,i trink one of my favorites was hem he worked as a fedex guy delivering a package for tony stunk in iron man .
12647,taht yes good . nice chatting with you !
12648,hi are you a fan on harry potter ?
12649,i a macabre of hp . i know jk rowling list h author .
12650,nice . stephen fry read all 7 harry potter audio books for the uk editions . i do n't know ho he is .
12651,"i have not listened to the books , so i can ' either . hard to believe rpowlign was turned down by 122 publishers ."
12652,"that 's incredible ! harry potter was born on july 1st , 1880 and the entire series tapes place throughout the 90s . i did n't know that ."
12653,i am surprised to heart his too . it was the most banned book so far i nthe 21st century .
12654,wow . harry potter books were translated from british to american english .
12655,no wonder it has become so popular in the us . the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide .
12656,"that 's incredible ! robin williams wanted to play hagrid in the harry potter movies , but wa turned down because j . k . rowling and director chris columbus only wanted british and irish actors ."
12657,"oh , i 've never heard that . that is pretty surprising . almost as surprising as rowling being the first billionaire to fall of the forbes billionaire list because of charitable giving ."
12658,wow . i would say kudos to her for doing that . j . k . rowling was asked to use her initials instead of her full name because her publishers were worried that boys would n't want to read a book written by a woman . tha sounds so absurd to me .
12659,i feel the same way . that is absurd that shrew as asked to do that . i 've been to universal and seen a bit of the hp attraction . rowling can go there and tell them to change anything incorrect .
12660,that 's interesting ! do you like snakes at all ? i 'm afraid i do n't like them . ol
12661,no way ! they are creepy ! i guess i 'd have to move to new zealand to get away from them as thee 's no snakes there .
12662,i 'll b joining you ! crocodiles are mores closely related to birds than they are to snakes and lizards . odd fact .
12663,google bought youtube for 1 . 65 billion
12664,interesting . there is a genus off lying snakes that can launch themselves at prey . yikes !
12665,well i hope they do n't live around me ! it 's funny that there are lizards without but they 're not snakes .
12666,i will pass on those as well . lol it 's been fun chatting !
12667,thank you ! it 's been nice chatting with you too .
12668,have a great night !
12669,did you know johnny depp directed the 1997 film brave ?
12670,"he 's one of those multitalented people . i still remember seeing him in edward scissorhands , but i did n't realize he only aid 196 words i teh whole movie"
12671,"yeah , tha was a good movie , i didnt ' know he smokes so little in teh film ."
12672,"i guess that shows how wel his action was in itself . i also need im in the 2005 remake of willy wonka , but gene wilder refused to watch the movie because he did n't want to be disappointed"
12673,interesting . did you know there are no walmarts in nyc ?
12674,that 's not surprising . i wonder if that 's due more to space or to population . i would ' g be surprised if it had to do with politics
12675,i pink it was because the unions do n't want them there .
12676,i can see that . chicago 's nickname as the ' windy city ' is taught to be about the lion but is based more on the politicians
12677,i 'm not surprised . politicans in kentucky have to swear san oath that they 've never participated in a duel .
12678,"taht probably originated decades ago , but i guess it can still be relevant . during the middle ages when entice was successful , many thought their politicians were chosen by lottery"
12679,i can believe that . did you knw that when you turn 100 in japan the pm sends you a silver cup .
12680,"nowadays , people love so long that that venture could get expensive . no wonder they 're looking int chaser cups"
12681,"lol , i 'm not sure . but apparently the pm position does n't even exist in australia 's constitution ."
12682,which is strange since they were owned by england . i guess that 's where the custom domes from
12683,"yeah , apparently it is just a custom ."
12684,a radio station pretended to eb canadian pm jean chretien and pranked the queen of england . hopefully few had a good sense o humor about that
12685,this is hilarious . 8 'm sure she did n't take e good liking to that .
12686,i guess we may never kno of the pm of the uk during wwi is the greatgrandfather of thee actress helena bonham carter . she was i nthe harry potter movies
12687,interesting . i never saw hem . did you ?
12688,"no , i haven ' . maybe one day . i would watch a movie about dr . seuss that johnny depp is producing . he may even be starring in it"
12689,"yeah , i probably would too . i used to read dr . seuss when i was younger ."
12690,and he 's a good enough actor to possibly do the roll well . no wonder he has so many awards
12691,hello how are you doing today ?
12692,"hello , i am doing good . how are you ; what do you think of countries having prime ministers ?"
12693,i 'm doing good thanks for asking . i think it 's different . what about you ?
12694,"it is different , i agree . i am not sure how such power they have . it seems like they can do a little more that a president can but i am not certain n ."
12695,i saw the president of the uk has a cat with a government title of chief mouser .
12696,"lol ! well , i can they can do a bit more if they can have title 's to their pets !"
12697,i agree lol . the pm position of australia is n't in the constitution and is only a custom .
12698,"that could be scary for the prime minister . at any time the public could decide they no longer like the just . i canada however , the prime minister serves as long as the queen wastes ."
12699,"thet would be scary . when you turn 100 in japan , the pm sends you a silver cup to celebrate ."
12700,do a lot of people turn a 100 in japan ?
12701,apparently they o . they will need to start making cheaper silver cups lol .
12702,"hhahaha ! hey , c heck this out . in bulgaria heir monarchy died at age 49 during 2 so his 6 year old son became leader . for obvious reasons th peopel voted to end the monarchy soon after that wand start a democracy . flash forward 58 years and the now 64 year old previous ruler ran for prime minister and them people lots him in !"
12703,lol ! did you know politicians in kentucky must swear an oath that they 've never participated n a duel before taking office ?
12704,no i dd n't ! even in this day an have they still have to do that ?
12705,i guess so lol . do you like johnny depp ?
12706,i do like him . i think he sometimes comes across as strange but on the flip side he i actually nice . he takes his jack sparrow costume with bum wherever he goes so he can visit kids in children 's hospitals dressed in character .
12707,"he 's definitely strange , but a very good too . he directed the brave in 1997 ."
12708,i donner remember that mover . was it good ?
12709,i 've never seen it either . johnny dep only said 196 cords in edward scissorhands .
12710,i did see that one and i liked it . did you know that his related to queen elizabeth ?
12711,it was great talking to you !
12712,"so there , did you know that array voice was the deputy prime minister of australia ?"
12713,"no , but i do like australia , from what i 've heard about it . is barney voice in the news lately ?"
12714,"in fact yes , he has been featured in an news articles regarding scandals that he has had ."
12715,i guess he 's not the lowest key prime minister you could get . i guess many politicians get in the news for unflattering circumstances now andc he n .
12716,"i agree , a although some other politicians have had it worse . bob hawke had many affairs , for example"
12717,they 're most as flamboyant as johnny depp in those pirate movies .
12718,yep . ben clif would fall under the same category
12719,"that 's the first news i 've heard of the prime minister of australia . i 've heard that in the uk there is a cat that lives in the prime minister 's residence with chief mouser as his title , though !"
12720,really ! i wish i could attain a title that easily
12721,japan also has a prime minister . when you turn one hundred years old he sends you a silver cup .
12722,"i do not think that he has sent that many silver cups then . in my opinion , prime ministers are superior to presidents ."
12723,"yes , politicians can be strange . they 've outlawed walmarts in new york city ."
12724,they also split ups kimmel oil after it became too big of a company . do you think trump is doing a good job governing america a ?
12725,"i heard he 's made more jobs and housing , but other than that , no . he 's on social media too much ."
12726,"in my opinion , the government shutdown was his fault . speaking of politician , did you know that venice ws successful due to its governing system ?"
12727,"no , how id that work ? i heard in kentucky the politicians must swear by oath that they 've never been in a duel , though ."
12728,really ? i have also heard that president james buchanan had a boyfriend . is boyfriend was referred as ' his better half '
12729,that 's amazing ! i heard queen elizabeth ii was once successfully prank called by a radio station pretending to be prime minister jkf canada jean chretien .
12730,team is a pretty good prank . i just wanted to point out that johnny depp directed the 1997 film ' teh brave ' i really enjoyed that firm
12731,"yes , i 've seen that ! johnny depp is in a lot of movies i like ! i wonder if he will ever be like ernie and become an actor turned politician ?"
12732,i wonder . johnny depp only said 196 words in edward scissorhands . i find that quite fascinating .
12733,tha is pretty cool ! i do n't remember him saying much . i ca n't wait for the upcoming dr . seuss movie he 's going to be making !
12734,do you follow politics much ?
12735,"yes , a prime minister is the head of the state and executive branch of he government . h eis the head of all states ."
12736,do you live in a country that has a prime minister ?
12737,he gives advice to the council of ministers whenever they need it . he plan the schemes for the welfare of the radio and people .
12738,taht 's very interesting . is that a prime minister of your country ?
12739,do you like in a country has prime minster ?
12740,"no , my country has a president . hat about yours ?"
12741,my country has a president .
12742,my country ha one too . i read about politics and the president in my country a lot . do you read about the politics of your country ?
12743,"us , the president has executive ; power in day to day life . he creates welfare schemes for the nation and people ."
12744,that 's great ! it sounds like your president has a good plan for the country . does he have people in teh government to help him ?
12745,surely . before taking any decision he surely has meetings with experts and the opposition party leader to ask their opinions .
12746,"you are right . in pol ; critics , it is best when both parties talk to each other and agree . does your country 's government agree a lot , or argue a lot ?"
12747,it is yeh president 's duty to explain the current situation to the opposition part members . only then wi ; l he take theyd necessary steps .
12748,your president souns like a strong leader . there is a lot of arguing in politics with my country 's president .
12749,the president thinks only of the welfare of the nation and the people . peope are confident in his ability to govern .
12750,"the president sounds like a very good man who thinks of his people , not just himself . he is an inspiring politician ."
12751,"in democratic countries , politicians seek the positions in the government through elections ."
12752,democratic elections give the people a chance to choose who they want leading them . do you ive in a democratic country ?
12753,"yes , the government is for the people . people enjoy real power by casting their vote . politicians can canvas the people to seek their vote ."
12754,ia m glad tho hear you live in a country fit a good president and a good government . voting for politicians is a good way to say what you think . it was good talking to you .
12755,mission impossible is a great movie i area ; . like it
12756,"i actually have n't seen all of them , but one of my friends really liked fallout"
12757,"i thought at as good , tom cruise is a great actor , he makes the franchise com to life"
12758,game you seen him in the last samurai ? he s ; and two years learning swordplay an japanese for that role
12759,i thouhg threat was a great movie as well and really ? looks like he takes his roles in movies real serious . i guess that 's why he earns that much money .
12760,"the 's probably why he does his roles so well . the team ' the last samurai ' id actually a plural reference to a can though , not just one character"
12761,"yeah that makes sense , did you heard about the 10m illion bunker h has ?"
12762,the one he bought to protect himself from aliens ?
12763,"yeah th came one , expensive but it must be alien proof"
12764,he must have done money despite the fact that seinfeld ba sa higher net worth
12765,"he doest ? w sell tom cruise will eventually come on top , he has a lot more movies planned in te future . i don ; t know about seinfeld ."
12766,what 's interesting is that tom cruise is actually the fourth generation in his family with that name
12767,"he is ? i wonder if there are any other actors as well ,"
12768,"proabably a few . the guy who invented the hoover board is named tom kruse , and tom cruise actually threatened him for using the name"
12769,"well it is also his name lol , that is kind of funny and could get a lot of people confused"
12770,did you ever hear about hte guy who pulled off a heist similar to what in mission impossible ?
12771,"no , i they have success ? that awesome , also really risky"
12772,the the successful . as successful as mission impossible ii wwf for tom cruise since he made 7 million just for that movie
12773,"that a lot of money , did you know he scaled thet tallest building in the film goof miss impossible 4 !"
12774,"an when he did it , he was n't wearing safety equipment !"
12775,"wow and there 's also the one on the side of the airplane at 5 , 000 feet ! that just gives me the creeps . i think i had enough of action for one day . it 's been great chatting with you but i 'm going to call it a night ."
12776,have a good evening !
12777,are you a fan of tom cruise ?

12781,"hahaha , i love that movie . i think it is one of his best ."
12782,"i loved it . then of course there came top gun nd then cocktail in 1988 . that soundtrack was huge that summer , which was the summer before my senior high school at ."

12784,lol yes me too ! aladdin 's face was based on tom cruise . i never knew that . haha
12785,"i did n't know that . wel l , apparently he has a underground bunker too ."
12786,oh wow . wonder what that 's all about ? the municipal government of paris passed a resolution to prohibit tom cruise from becoming an honorary citizen of the city .
12787,wel apparently it is to hide from aliens .
12788,"oh boy lol tom hung off the side of an airplane that was warning at 5 , 9000 feet for the new mission impossible movie ."
12789,that is pretty cool . i heard about tha to he likes to doh is own stunts .
12790,yes i 've heard that too . the las samurai is plural and refers to the last clan not samurai and not just tom cruise 's character in the movie e
12791,interesting ; did you see that movie ? i saw it .

12806,it was in honor of walter elias disney apparently
12807,that is really cool ! disney does such interesting stuff right there in plain sight of everyone but at the same time it 's huddle if that makes sense . have you ever seen them on flubber ? i heard they actually consulted with bill nye about it .

12989,i have . i really want to though . ill have to see if it is on netflix .
12990,it was ok . i think it was very tthat belle had a british accent even though she was from france lol
12991,i never though of that part ; i guess in the cartoon she doesnt have one at all .
12992,"yeah , the cartoons almost no one has an accent ."
12993,except lumber . he is the only one . and come to think of it the tempos had a british one in the cartoon too .
12994,lol weir . been great chatting with yo !
12995,hey how 's it going ? did you watch the oscars this year ? they ave out a set of 23 awards for many accomplishments in the fil industry .
12996,i did not wathc this year but i do know some of my favorite actors have previously avon . daniel day lewis is the only actor to win 3 times .
12997,yeah hes ' a great actor . the movie blazing saddles was nominated for three oscars !
12998,"wow ! i dod not know that . so surprising , is eminem has more oscars than decaprio , depp , lucas , murray and will smith combined ."
12999,"nat is very hard to believe . and he 's no then an actor , well i guess he is . walt disney t this key holds the record for most oscars won by a man . now taht makes sense ."
13000,i heard that he has 22 oscars under his name . he deserves it . i can not thin koi more iconic film than disney .
13001,totally agree with you . the oscars themselves were even nominated for nine emmys in 2013 !
13002,how funny . i wondr if they won any . when it comes to oscars i do not think anyone has been nominated more than her streep . often described as the ' best actress of herd generation . '
13003,leah she really is a great actress . she even had w actress daughter whoo plays the fbi agent on mr . robot .
13004,"meryl streep has been nominated for 21 academy awards , only won three . she was nominated for 31 golden globe nominations , wen eight ."
13005,incredible ! since she 's only won three times shed is in second place for me awards .
13006,have you ever seen the movie julie and julia with meryl streep ? it is so great and makes me very hungry each him i watch it
13007,i do n't think i 've seen bet but i will add it to my list . another good actress is emma watson . i thoughts h way so good in the harry potter series .
13008,"i love the harry potter films . i think it is adorable hat the director of prisoner of azkaban made tha actors write essays about their characters . emma wrote 1 pages , daniel radcliffe turned in a page and rupert grant forgot his ."
13009,that is hilarious ! emma almost considered not playing hermi0on erin the half blood prince . that would have been devastating for the series .
13010,i am so glad that she decided to continue . she said she could not watch someone else play the role and i am not sure if i could ; i either .
13011,yes i agree with her . emma is also a certified yoga teacher ! i would love to take et class .
13012,me too . i think she would be fantastic at it . i was surprised to find out that her and forgot robbin were both born in 1990 . they do not seem like the same age .
13013,"yeah i agree that is surprising for sure . sounds like she had some star studded classmates at hte dragon school too ! well , was really nice getting the chance to talk wit hyou !"
13014,"it has been nice talking with you as well . make sure to watch lots of great movies and especially julie and julia . one of the actors in the film , stanley tucci , is a great cook and taught meryl streep ."
13015,definitely . thanks !
13016,do you watch the academy awards regularly ?
13017,"i do n't , i just kind or stink all the award shows are somewhat of a joke and people do n't credit they are owed . i mean its crazy the eminem has won more oscars than all of those actors combined ."
13018,i did not know that eminem has won many scars .
13019,"neither did i . not that he is n't a good rapper , just shocks mr he would win so many especially with what a lot of his lyrics stand for . i am also surprised that the oscars were nominated 9 times at the emmys , i really did n't know that was possible ."
13020,he is not even officially in the film industry .
13021,"i know . blazing saddles won 3 times , i have no idea what movie that even is lol . i guess i have some investigating to do ."
13022,me too . leonardo decaprio ia a real actor yet eminem has won more awards .
13023,"a three , all of the actors listed are definitely ore deserving . liken meryl streep , i mean she only won 3 time but at least was recognized for her talent multiple times ."
13024,you are right . i like meryl streep . i think she should et more oscars than eminem .
13025,"i agree . how do you like emma watson ? from what i have seen people love her or hate her , i think especially to when she speaks on certain subjects ."
13026,i do not follow her . . know that she was in marry potter films .
13027,i think the that most people know her from
13028,she wax in the movie because she wrote a long essay compared to the other two candidates .
13029,she really wanted the role at was dedicated to it by her choice to boom back and continue to play the character when she almost left .
13030,she did not wan owner people to play the role and so he decided to stay .
13031,it was a good choice . switching a main character can ruin the movie
13032,i would think so .
13033,i did like her in beauty and the beast . its on netflix if you have access . brings back memories of childhood
13034,i ike girly mobiles ? . wass he the voice in beauty and the beast ?
13035,"its actually the more modern version , its not a cartoon so she plays a real human ."
13036,"oh only , i have never seen it . i saw the cartoon version of beauty an 'the beast ."
13037,its either from 2017 or 2018 . netflix has it if you or anyone has access to it .
13038,thank you for your info ; . nice talking to you .
13039,hello hows it going ? do you watch teh academy awards ?
13040,"hi , i have n't have you ? did you that that daniel daylewis is th only actor to win best actor at the oscars 3 times ?"

13042,walt disney hold the record for most oscars with 22 . that does n't seem surprising though .
13043,"disney is amazing ! i am a huge disney fan , so yeah i love their movies !"
13044,"eminem has more well with more oscars than dicaprio , depp , smith , lucas , and murray combined ."
13045,"wow , thats interesting . for what ?"

13050,"interestingly , stanely tucci is an incredible cook and made meryl streep cook wait him to prepare for julie and julia ; that was a fun movie by the way ."
13051,"that is awesome ! having stanleys tucci teach you how to cook lol while making a movie , while getting paid lol"
13052,streep first in role was actually a sports movie .
13053,"i saw that . did you know emma watson went to dragon school , i know its really prestigious n al , but do me i sounds like a place where you train dragons and that would be amazing !"
13054,"before the filming of harry potter and the prisoner f azkaban , the director alfonso cuaron had daniel radcliffe and other actors write essays about heir characters with watson pumping out a 16 page essay and radcliffe one page"
13055,"yeah i heard that before , of course she would lol"
13056,"watson actually was considering not playing hormone but changed her mind sing she could n't watch someone else p , ay it in the half blood prince"
13057,i wouldve been heart broken if she didnt play it . did you know emma and marriot robbin are 'the same age e ? thats a trip !

13155,that is a little surprising . i would have thought gran pr xfl something like that . . . . i bet logic would beat you in mario kart !
13156,probably . he won all those batters against different wrappers . he must be good .
13157,or rappers are not god at mario kart ! coins make you go faster and stop you from spinning out .
13158,it 's interesting hat the items are not random but meant to balance out power among players .
13159,i did not know that . nintendo produced knock off legos when they were a toy company . weird .
13160,"the company tried many things , but video games made them . they came into the market just after the big crash in 1983 . they released a handheld for pokemon ."
13161,nintendo owns the seattle mariners ? ! ? ! ? ! huh ?
13162,they are a huge company . nintendo of america is in seattle . i do n't think they have any love hotels there though .
13163,i used to love paying legend of zelda . did you that that one ?
13164,never played zelda . very popular thouhg . a big par too popular culture . did you know that jim hanks does woody 's voice in video games ? i guess tom is too busy .
13165,someone estimates that we all 3 billion hours of video games every week ? that 's too much . . .
13166,video games have replaced television as our favored distraction . it 's all jane mcgonigal 's fault .
13167,ha ! jane . . . nice chatting with you !
13168,are you a video game fan ?
13169,"yeah , used to be very much into nintendo back in the day . they are still one of the world 's largest video game companies ."
13170,they 're facing a lot of competition these days . what games did you play ?
13171,"i liked the old school games , transylvania , pro wrestling , hada , and the first mario which is one of the top selling video game franchises . you ?"
13172,"i used to play computer games , ot video games . i liked stuff on the pc . i have played fzero on the super nintendo , plus some football games on the sega ."
13173,"i like walt of the old school fooball gaines , liek madden . played that a ton inc college . fzero was pretty good too , the first racing game to run at 60 fps ."
13174,played a lot of madden on the genesis . i ; eaten a lot about football . ever really liked other football games . did you play gameboy ?
13175,"no , never really got into that . i think that was specifically for pokemon and i never played that game ."
13176,"i played gb fact , in the was . i was ' 'the best platform , but many people had the games ."
13177,"yeah . nintendo a been around a long time , over a hundred years . they have really reinvented themselves over the years ."
13178,they 've designed some great games . they 'll always e a force in the industry .
13179,agreed . and they 're even branched off into sports ownership . htey own the seattle mariners .
13180,"nintendo of america is in seattle , s i 'm not surprised ."
13181,large japanese influence in seattle . fusajiro yamaucho founded nintendo by the way .
13182,i know the company used to make some kind of playing cards . not much of az market or that these days .
13183,"somewhat . my brother in law plays the magic game , but i do n't really understand it . video games are so mich more popular , all over the world . funny that it is illegal fork is under 16 to play games after midnight in south korea ."
13184,i think the kids were up al night playing instead of studying .
13185,makes sense . not sure how to live that though . some say its a plant we play three billion hours o video games a week . that is unfathomable to me .
13186,"people get addicted . well , i enjoyed chatting !"
13187,"same here , have a great da ."
13188,tanks !

13192,"yea , i remember collecting a bunch of coin and nor spinning out when hit with the turtle shell too"
13193,did yu know it is illegal for kids under 16 in south korea to play video games past midnight ?
13194,i mean i do n't think kids should play pas midnight but to make it a law is ridiculous
13195,"yeah , that is pretty absurd . did you know nintendo produced a lego knock off ?"
13196,"no , i did know they made playing card though"
13197,"oh yesh , i remember that . it was founded as a card company in 1889 ."
13198,"yea and now they own the seattle mariners , they'v4c ome a far way"
13199,do they really ? i did n't know that . is that true ?
13200,yea and ou can use a 3ds to order food direct to your seat during a mariners game
13201,taht is pretty cool l would you recommend a ps4 or xbox over nintendo now though ?
13202,"only if do n't either have a ps4 . xbox already , i bout a switch just to basically play mario and pokemon lol"
13203,"is that their new games console , the mini thing ?"
13204,"yea , you can play the switch on the tv or a handheld , i take out in 2017"
13205,"interesting , maybe i 'll check it out . does it have newer games or just old ones ?"
13206,"mostly new ga , 3 like mario kart 8 deluxe and new versions of mario and zelda too"
13207,"oooh , that does sound cool . righty law i just play games on the pc . well , n . chatting ."
13208,"you too , i 'm gon na play some fzero x at fps"
13209,nice ! that it easy !
13210,helo . did you know nintedo is over 100 years old ?
13211,no i did n't know that . i do know that the n64 was awesome though q i loved fzero that game was so fast it 's a racing game
13212,"taht was a good game . they started out as a playing card company . i did n't know they owned the , mariners ."
13213,"no i did n't know that either . i also did ' know that they made a handheld system just for the game pokemon back in 2001 , i owned what system that was"
13214,"i never heard of that either . i wonder if it was only for the japanese market ? at the mariners games , you can install lean app for the 3ds to order food ."
13215,"that 's really good at makes me hungry ! and yes like you said , nintendo is over 100 years old but they started making playing cards originally , they did not start with making video games"
13216,"i think its awesome that xbox has controllers for quadriplegics , they can use them on other consoles too ."
13217,"yes i think that 's really nice . i remember when xbox first came out back in 201 , i got it on launch dad , my parents got it for me while i was at school lol"
13218,my son would be the only ho spent 2600 to win an xbox at a carnival game . . . and end up with the banana faith dreadlocks .
13219,lol yep unfortunately should have just bought the xbox out right haha . do you know that the army uses xbox 360 controllers ? it 's cheaper than making custom news apparently
13220,"yes , i did . a friend 's son be a uav pilot . tom hank 's brother voices woody in games and merchandise ."
13221,"yeah that 's interesting . they probably sound very similar since their brothers haha . i remember that if you left the xbox on for a long time lou would hear weird sounds if you had the dashboard on th screen , and apparently that is a thing thet intended lol that 's crazy"
13222,"that is weird . almost as weird as games bing called cathode ray tube amusement devices , by the miltary ."
13223,yes that name definitely sucks he fun right out of video times lol . do you know that humans as a whole play about 3 billion hours of video games a week ?
13224,"i can believe it , and i wonder how many of those south korea kids under 16 abide by the 'no games after midnight ' rule ?"
13225,"yeah that would have ben a problem for me as a kid haha . ; do you know who stephen fry is ? h redid the narration for a lot of movies and video games like the harry potter video ga , mesh"
13226,yeah . he also did the narration for little big planet .
13227,"oh wow i did ike that give . i never played the hitchhiker 's guide to th galaxy lame , although i did watch the movie , did you read the book or watch the movie ?"
13228,i have bot . it 's on my list . did you ever have any of the lego knockoffs that nintento produced ?
13229,n't i do n't . but it does sound interesting . i wonder if they 're worth any money ? i do collect lego i have a lot of those lol i would be mad if i had some counterfeit lego in my collection though
13230,i like their architecture series . i guess some classify video games as an art form .
13231,"ye si think so . i miss the days of the xbox though . they first came out with online video games then , and i would spend a lot of time on xbox live"
13232,hi how are you ? have you seen guardians of the galaxy ?

13285,there you go ! s end that idea to them ! especially since all these consoles rarer the in china ! might be a secret plan !
13286,thats funny a soccer game panned three playstation generations since it 's really the only international port
13287,wow ! nintendo produced z lego knockoff when they were a toy company .
13288,i did not know nintendo owned the seattle mariners ?
13289,mow either ! nintendo released a handheld console specifically for pokemon in 2001 .

13316,maybe the rats controlling the robots can play destiny 2
13317,that should eb fun to see ! robots ca be guide by an external control device or the control may be embedded within .
13318,grant imahara created a robot
13319,why ? robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look .

13349,ia m ! super mario was always my favorite game . di you know nintendo started in 1889 as a playing card company ?
13350,i always moved super mario when i was growing up . i did not know that fact . that 's interesting !
13351,they also own the seattle mariners .
13352,i was not aware of that either . it 's interesting that the phrase 'it 's on like donkey kong ' was trademarked my nintendo .
13353,"did they trademark that ? mart , it s still a popular phrase . i have friends who say that all the time ."
13354,"yes , it was trademarked in 2010 . i 've heard tha phased used a lot as well ."
13355,nintendo even made a lego knock off . they have done so many things i havent even realized .
13356,cool . they definitely have done o many stings that i had n't realized either . i did n't realize they had tried several shall niche businesses sas well .
13357,it is only the third most profitable company in japan too . i wonder what the first two are .
13358,wow ! i 'd like to know as well considering nintendo has such a large cash reserve that it would lose so much money and not bankrupt for a long while .
13359,"yeah , they are valued at over 85 billion ."
13360,"that is insane ! i did n't realize they produced poke , on as well . i never got into that ."
13361,"i got into the pokemongo , but ot anything else ."
13362,"i saw people using that wall over the place . i never got into it , but i think i woul hav been rather addicted if i had ."
13363,"it is a fun thing to do , some of my friends go tme into it ."
13364,it seems like it would really keep you active .
13365,"it does and i , encourages talking . i enjoy the time outside with it ."
13366,"that 's a really positive thing for sure , as most video games encourage being sedentary and staying indoors ."
13367,true ! its been nice chatting ! have a good night !
13368,good morning ! are of a fan of disney ?
13369,"i love the franchise , its been almost 100 years of magic since the company got founded back in 1923"
13370,walt and roy disney definitely knew that they were doin back in the day .
13371,"i bet they did , they changed our culture forever with the creation of mickey mouse nd his friends ."
13372,"it 's funny when how think about it , is n't it ? i mean , a mouse had such a profound effect on everyone and everythings ."
13373,"it has , and then theres also the princess and all the other characters disney has created ."
13374,"for example , minnie mouse . do you know waht minnie is short fo r ?"
13375,no what is minnie a short for ?
13376,minerva . her name eis actually minerva mouse . i think minnie suits her much better o n't you ?
13377,i prefer minnie mouse a lot more .
13378,have you ever seen big hero 6 ?
13379,"i have that movie was great cool fact but it was done using a 55 , 000 for super computer"
13380,i though it was great too ! it really surprises e that it was so goo d ! it 's also impressive about that super computer do n't you think ?
13381,"it is impressive , that must be a really powerful machine , do you know who bill nye is ?"
13382,i do . he ' ; s the science guy . he 's a ; lso a founder of the planetary society i think .
13383,"yeah the same one , well he also appears in flubber , he is the science consultant in that movie"
13384,that i did n't know ! i guess by having him consult teh added som authenticity 5o the movie and to flubber itself .
13385,"it did , many people liked his show so yeah , do you like chris pratt ?"
13386,he 's okay . i 've seen him in a couple of movies like guardians of the galaxy and a jurassic park one . do you ?
13387,"i thing is a great actor , i thought he was younger but he was born in the year 1979"
13388,"i thought he was younger too . i learned recently that he got discovered while awaiting tables in man . that 's cool . well , i 've got to go now . it 's been nice chatting with you ! have a great day !"
13389,have you seen guardians of the galaxy ?
13390,i have seen it . i thought it was good . have you seen it ?
13391,. have not . do you know why james funny was n't retired ?
13392,i think the studio id n't want any bad publicity or law suits fro mis tweets that eh made years ago .
13393,what were his inappropriate jokes bout ?
13394,seems like they were were sexist and homophobic in nature . in today 's climate it would be easy for someone o claim offense tot hem .
13395,yes you 're spot on . do you think his firing nwas fair since he had apologized before ?
13396,i do n't think it 's fair . i do n't think people should be held accountable for things there aid years ago . like wax different years ago and peopple not so easily offended . tou ?
13397,i agree with you . it happened several years ago . it says protrumpers found them and posted them to social media . that seems odd . . .
13398,it does seem odd handm cakes you wonder if that part is true . who knows . i think if he did a good job on it movies and did n't commit ana actual crime hen so bs it .
13399,yes . so i believer guardians is a marvel movie . do you like other marvel movies ?
13400,i do like iron man and thor nad captain maverick . how about you ?
13401,"i do n't believe i 've seen those . i do n't follow the marvel series too closely , i do know chris pratt plays a real in a show on tv , parks and rec . have you seen it ?"
13402,'m and i did n't know he did that . id id se whim in jurassic park and thouhg he was good .
13403,"is aw the fastest one , jurassic park 3 . di you see that ? it was pretty good !"
13404,not sure . hte laws one taht i saw was a year ago i think .
13405,"yes this one is time out in the las team months . i think there are a couple guardians movies , have you seen the al ; l or just one ?"
13406,"just the first one . have you seen them a , l ?"
13407,"no i havent seen any . well , i 've seen parts of a few but have n't watched one through . i think there is a raccoon or something in them ? lol"
13408,"yeah , the first one was cute and fun i guess . did you know about the subculture dedicated to finding the hidden mickey mouse images in al disney things ? i wonder if there is one in hte movie ."
13409,"haha i didn know that , but i imagine at the park they put them all sorts of different places !"
13410,hey what do you thin about chris pratt by the way ? it 's funny that he wanted to hire the director james dunk for the new guardians of hte galaxy movie

13414,"oh yeah absolutely ! it 's cool that he told steven spielberg he would be in jurassic park 4 , back in 201 0 , and then hee essentially was lol"

13416,it is really nice of im ew hat do you think about glenn howerton ? he actually was the star of always sunny in philadelphia and he almost got the lead in jurassic world

13423,"thats ' interesting ! are you a fan of bill nye ? he actually served as a science consultant for disney on flubber , surprisingly enough !"
13424,"that is surprising especially considering how unrealistic that movie is lol , also did you know that minnie mouse 's real name is minerva mouse"
13425,that 's pretty cool . never knew new had a real name ! just as many people do n't know theres a subculture dedicated to finding hidden mickey mouse images in all things disney !
13426,yep that is cool lol . what do you think about it diesel getting a secret script thati says what groot is actually speaking in the movie
13427,"is that so ? speaking of root , i ca n't believe his first appearance was way back in 1959 i that was called ' tales to astonished 13 ' ."
13428,that is a long tiem ago ! what do you think about 'the chinese name for guardians of eh galaxy or there ? it is the : interplanetary unusual attack team lol
13429,ha ! di you read the full letter signed by the cast voicing heir support for james guns after is firing that pratt posted on instagram ? i was so sad and i hate he was fired but you 've got ta be extra careful in this day and age !
13430,"yes you do have to b extra careful ! i was shocked all those people signed the letter for him thought , he did after all apologize for the homophobic posts"
13431,"how 's i going , do you like disney ? it 's the worlds largest independent media conglomerate"
13432,i do like disney . i have an 8 year old a definitely been rewatching all the disney stuff from my childhood ! i ca n't believe the disney company is almost 100 years old
13433,"yea , disney has come a long way since then disney brothers founded it i 1923"
13434,who would have thought a company that established themselves as an animation leader would grow int such ha conglomerate ! ?
13435,"yea , disney grew from an animation studio into one that did liveaction film , tv , and theme parks !"
13436,i loved the movie walle . i did n't ellie until recently it was named that as a tribute to walter elias disney . very cool !
13437,"i had no clue , i also did n't know minnie was story for minerva mouse"
13438,"such a fancy name ! did you read dr . suess growing up ? i was a big fan ! he really accomplished a lot . over 60 books , 11 tv specials , 5 films , a broadway musical , add 4 television series !"
13439,"yea , dr seuss accomplished so much despite being voted least likely to succeed by his classmates"
13440,if only they knew ! he was actually a doctor too !
13441,"that 's pretty cool , i just thought it was a pop name eh used so he could still write for hi college 's humor magazine acted being caught drinking"
13442,"no , although it was just an honorary phd from dartmouth . however , he only used the dr . part o him name after receiving this ."
13443,"that 's pretty cool , he deserves it for coming up with the word d ' nerd '"
13444,"haha , yup i wonder what his movies would have got on rotten tomatoes . do you use that site ? i use it a lot , but it can be so far off . soy sides somehow ios 93 percent on rotten tomatoes !"
13445,"i tend to avoid rotten tomatoes since it 's owned by warner bros , too much conflict of interest"
13446,yup . they must give out a lot or 100 percent ratings since netflix alone has 150 movies with a 100 percent rating from rotten tomatoes .
13447,too bad video game movies ca n't do better than 44 percent on rotten tomatoes
13448,that is crazy . you would think a company launched by 3 undergrad would give more love to video games !
13449,"and michael bay too , but his average film rating is 38 percent"
13450,"his movies are just ok , but 38 percent average is for sure surprising ."
13451,"well i got to go , nice talking with you"
13452,pay do you like disney movies ? i guess the name minnie mouse is actually short for minerva
13453,"hr mother must not have like the ! yes , i am a disney fan . amazing how big it has grown in less than 100 years !"
13454,yeah a it was founded back in 1923 and it is definitely approaching 100 years . that seems really insane to me

13456,yes i agree ! what is your favorite disney movie by the way ? i really like the little mermaid and beauty and the beast
13457,"those are probably my favorites too ! i have not watched much of teh disney channel , so i can not weigh in but hat , but the movies are usually a good bet when selecting somehting it watch . imagine that all of this would not ahve happened if it were not for the firing of walt disney from the local news ; paper for not being creative enough . . . he showed them !"
13458,"yes he did ! have you ever seen it movie big hero 6 ? i did n't really like it but i guess it use da 50 , 000 core supercomputer to render"
13459,"i have not seen it . must be pretty awesome . . . i wonder if it will be shown on their channel ? a few all , the disney channel only shows disney content . they do n't even allow adds for nokndisney shows or products !"
13460,"oh i never knew that . have you seen the disney movie flubber ? bil , l nye was a science consultant for that movie . that movie is definitely not realistic though haha"
13461,"disney , not realistic ? never ! did yo ever see hte collaborative film by disney and salvador dali called . ' destino ? i do n't think dali was known for his realism . . ."
13462,"no he was n't . i like salvador dali a lot though he was born on my birthday haha . have you ever seen a ' hidden mickey ' in many of the movies , i guess there 's a subculture tha looks for those in the movies"
13463,"yeah , and there was a big stink year saga when somebody sew the word ' sex ' painted amongst the star sin the lion king cartoon . regardless , it has not slowed down the moneymakiny macho . disney make about 1 , 110 per second ."

13465,"nice flick ! . really should give a no to another children 's icons , dr seuss ! are you a fan ?"
13466,"i guess he 's ok but he 's not my favorite . but i am also an cult haha . i guess that during world war ii he took a break from kids books and did some political turn , i never knew that"
13467,"really ? in today 's climate , he could be elected president , or at least the cat in the hat might . . . very bit a colorful character as any other candidate on the horizon . . ."
13468,well that woul be shocking because in high school he was voted least likely to succeed apparently haha .
13469,was theme the same fortune telling prowess as for disney ? i et nobody foray when he was studying at dartmouth that he could amount to his current level of notoriety . . .
13470,no not at all . no one would have forest that he got an honorary phd from there either . and hat 's only when he started data use the doctor part o hs anime
13471,"i like how he pronounced his own name , to rhyme with the word , ' voice '"

13482,yes warner bros . i do n't actual ; y know . do you think it being owned by wb has any effect on the previews ?
13483,i thin kit does . . . i 'm sure there is a pressure from wb about certain titles . . .
13484,"maybe . also , its nice that nets ; pix has 150 movies that have perfect rating on rotten tomatoes"
13485,"that 's quite an achievement ! i remember 23 years ago there as like one movie on netflix and look what i happening now . . . we do n't have enough time to catch up with all the shows and movies . . . great job , ! : ,"

13499,"the grinch was a good movie but i only saw the first one . the lorax looks like a good seuss movie i have n't seen yet , either ."
13500,i heard disney slips images of mickey mouse into their produce work . i wonder if they are in any of the disney suess remakes ?
13501,i 've heard lots off claims that the walt disney company has tons of hidden images in their stuff . . . but honestly i be tit 's only coincidence or the animators just having some fun .
13502,"due you know the name india , in the disney character , is short for minerva ?"
13503,minerva . . . . ant to say there is a cartoon with a lynx named that . i wish disney would depict measles as better han falling in love with the best looking prince around !

13573,yea but it did the best job of setting up infinity war l did you know infinity war was the first film to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras ?
13574,wow that must be expensive lol did you know the movie caused a increase in shawarma sales ?

13576,"well he did , and make people who didnt know what it was curious . did you know tom hiddleston was auditioning for thor , they decided he woul qb a better loki , i agree ."
13577,"i heard so , i ' , m glad hiddleston ended being casted as loki instead of thor"
13578,"hes a perfect fit for loki . hes w good for too . they make a great team , as actors . your call believe they are brothers lol"

13608,yeah and that is why she won an academy award for editing the film

13614,"wow , an 20th centry fox was convinced that the whole movie wa going to flop"
13615,fear of loss must babe blinded them to the potential . i guess they is how george lucas retained rights ?

13627,george was smart about merchandising . he got teh rights for a son g .
13628,"right , he did n't accept the directing fee and instead got licensing and merchandising rights instead"
13629,"it was about half a million , but he had money from previous films e directed . i guess he was willing to take the chance ."
13630,and it paid of lol . did you hear ho much jame earl jones and for vader 's lines ?
13631,i cant imagined it was much . the budget for the film was low . he has hte perfect spice for it though
13632,"for sure , i wonder ifr e got paid more and more after the initial success . he got like 7500 for 2 . 7 ours of work lol"

13636,"for sure , i heard she thought of the kiss seen was obi wan 's death"
13637,"yes , george as a lot of great ideas , but he needs help shaping the story . i dont like the later films because of that ."
13638,state is a good day to put it . i liked joe skywalker a lot . if you ever visit tunisia you can pay 10 dollars and stay a nigh int he home he lived at as a boy in the movie
13639,"that sounds like fun ! i bet the true fan the up to do that . i dont know if ill ever make it to tunisia , but it will keep that in mind"
13640,me neither lol . are you into science fiction movies also ?
13641,i likd science fiction films . i liked alien any aliens . you ?
13642,"i loved those movies , so scary and thrilling ! i like anything nasa also"
13643,what nasa films ? i dont know those
13644,"i just like nasa in general i guess . i was so nice chatting with you , enjoy your day !"
13645,did you know the last jedi was the highest grossing movie of 201 7 ?
13646,"no i did n't know that . i know it got a lot of backlash though , what did you think about it ?"
13647,it was ok but apparently fans thought it so bad that they petition to remove it frost h canon
13648,i agree with them it bought it was actually horrible lol but i 'm thinking they 're not going to take it out of an unfortunately . even mark mil who plays luke skywalker said that it was bad
13649,but he rented ! i bet he quickly found that it was the wrong thing to say
13650,yep you definitely do n't want to talk about mutlimilliondollar movies liken hat that you 're starring in lol what do you think about the other star wars movies though
13651,maybe thats why they killed him off . . . or whatever it is that happened to his character
13652,542 that 's true . i actually like the first star wars movie the best . it was made back in 1977
13653,george lucas was a good business man eh proposition 20th century fox to not take a 500k fee and instead to keep the merchandising and licensing rights . its made him a millionaire
13654,"yep that was really smart ! he is genius , but so was his wife at the time , marcia lucas , she helped with a lot of editing andc differnt things for the story nad does n't get any credit"
13655,she diff get credit ! she won an academy award while george lucas havne't won any
13656,well that 's good i did n't know that . but yeah he rides to kill off obiwan and also for a leia to give luke a good luck kiss i think w 're very important to the movie
13657,yes because of hte 41 factor wen we found out they were siblings lol
13658,haha team 's a good point ! do you understand the language o navajo by the way ? apparently you could watch star wars and navajo if you can haha
13659,i did n't even know navajo was a language . james earl jones only spent 2 . 5 . hours recording garth vaders voice and was paid 7500 i guess thats good money in the 70 's
13660,"yeah i think wo . plus that 's a lot of money to make per hour , even for such an iconic do , i bet he got paid more for future movies though"
13661,i guess it depends on what kind of royalties he ages .
13662,yep i forgot about royalties too . what other scene fiction movies do you like though ? i really like the movie attack
13663,im not sure ive seen that one . i know it has ethan fake . nasa apparently liked i since they name it them lost accurate science fiction movie of all time
13664,"yes big 's a great movie you need to watch it ! it 's interesting that nasa has a page of space technology terms that movie writers can use that are incredibly accurate , that 's probably what attack used"
13665,luck skywalker nwas writein as a girl ! hahah
13666,do you like star ward ?
13667,i sure do . do you know when the movie came out first ?
13668,yes that was n 1977 and it has bee awesome since then
13669,yes that is true . do you know who played the role of poe dameron ?
13670,ye it was oscar isaac who is from guatemala originally
13671,yeah and so he requested that e be a native of planet yavin 4 as it is filmed in guatemala
13672,yeah . did you know lucas ' wife changed thigns on the script nd added stuff to it ?
13673,yes and he eleven won an oscar for that
13674,"yeah she deserved it , he added the princess in good luck kiss in it"
13675,true do you like voters piece fiction movies ?
13676,"yes i do actually , d id yo know nasa has a list of terms that writers can use ?"
13677,wow nice . and they named attack as the most accurate movie of all time scientifically
13678,nice . did you know the mit science fiction society has a lifetime membership ?
13679,yeah and then if you die ad come back there is another one
13680,wow cool . did you know deep roy is the only one to hold the science fiction trifecta ?
13681,"yeah he appeared in doctor who , star trek and star wars"
13682,yeah . have you ever been to a fan convention ?
13683,i haven ot but i hear they are extremely lucrative fdr the industry overall
13684,. sure is . actors can earn more than 100 000 for just a weekend
13685,wow great is a lot of money a more than their salaries in movies
13686,yes so it is a gret way for them to make some extra
13687,good mornings . do you like walt disney movies ?
13688,"yes i love walt disney adn the movies tht you made , one of my favorites is sleeping beauty , what about you ?"
13689,i watch so many coming up . how about the computer that wore tennis shoes ? i liked many gov the recycled animations for the 90s .
13690,"haha i never saw that one . i did think that the movie frozen was ok , i never knew it was the first disney movie to be directed by a woman though"
13691,the did all kinds of things . the lion king was dubbed into zulu ; u for its release in africa .
13692,"well that makes sense because zulu is an african language . it ' ? s interesting that toy manufacturers actualy contact disney before movies are even being made , assuming it 's because they want to make the most money wit 'the tops"
13693,"speaking of movies , have you seen deadpool 2 ? the video game cost more to make than the original movie ."
13694,"i did see that movie . i liked the firs tone more , i also played he video game as well ! what about you ?"
13695,i 've seen the first one and it was funny and different from the other superhero movies . i did n't realize it was the highest grossing r rate film of all time that was not directed by cameron or lucas .
13696,"why that is impressive . i like how in the comics they alluded to deadpool looking like ' ryan reynolds crossed with a sharply ' , and then they actually got ryan reynolds to be the role in real life ahha"
13697,he also was the voice of the ' mystery villain ' . reynolds is pretty versatile .
13698,"i do n't remember the mystery villain par t , do you ? i think the best part of deadpool 2 was josh brolin how he played cable is awesome !"
13699,i have n't seen the 2nd one . i do know dp 2 was directed by david stitch . i wonder if he directed the 1st one ?
13700,"no it was a different director . i do n't know why they got rid of the first director for teh second movie though . i do like david fischer and james cameron , they both champion hte project which is good because otherwise it might no have been made"
13701,i wondr it that affected the quality of dp 2 ? hve you seen guardians of teh galaxy ?
13702,yes i saw that movie . i like the first one a lot . chris pratt is awesome ! what about you what did you think
13703,i 'm really not into the superhero genre . i do admire ad lobbying . dig suess a line from may popping was ad climbed ish gg 2 . brave !
13704,that way a good line ! funny that hey were growing to do a six pack on chris pratt with cgi am lol i guess that turned out not to be necessary
13705,"yeah , who cares . . . china adn taiwan renamed gg to ' interplanetary unusual attack team . ' a mluhtful what 's kinda odd . . ."
13706,"that is very odd . do you remember if james guns is going to be the director for the third movie ? is know there was some controversy with a post he made on twitter , and he directed the first two , so it would be weird i he did n't direct the last one"
13707,i really do n't know . you were excellent ! thanks for the chat !
13708,what do you think of selfcensorship on platforms like twitter ?
13709,"i 'm not a big fan , but it 's always to eb looked at in , many different ways . how about you ?"
13710,"i think it exposes the fallback that everyone can just be themselves , truly expressive e , on such platforms . i then mob con ' g et 'you ' for reading something , then it 's not free . it an edgy content creators like dan harmon lavigne to apologize . . l it ; s really plain to see ."
13711,"yeah too much pc is lame for me , to me you should be able to creat whatever content you want and if its bad then its bad and people wont like it because it sucks ."
13712,"right . is n't that the purpose of ' downvoting ' anything . . . or not seeing a movie you do n't like ? i never saw deadpool because i do n't want fo . its ' rated r , and that 's not my thing , especially with my family . i dont protest the theaters ."
13713,"exactly , fee will is a good thing and should keep it that way . i do n't go to see most of the superhero movies because i do n't think they are good , i do n't protest ."
13714,"do you think that there is an element where such shaming ' should be employed ? would it be crossing the line if i said humiliating criminal , s who haven committed heinous crimes should be allowed ? what do you think ?"
13715,"im up for free content creation for whatever , unless it is supporting to do some sort o criminal behavior like organizing a mob of riot or soemthing ."
13716,that makes hence . so if harmon was trying to recruit time travelers to do with e was showing . . . that would be bad enough ?
13717,"yeah who knows , but you know how sensitive people are even to stuff that isnt remotely add ."
13718,"is there a way , do you think , to reverse this trend ? or do you think it 's going to get worse , and famous people will just start to quit or jeter their social media ?"
13719,i think it will just continually get worse . people are more and more pc each day . you really ca n't have an opinion unless it 's the right one there days .
13720,yes . . . sa do what opinion of yours would you share on social media if you felt you woudl n't be moved ?
13721,that is a very good question . i do n't think i know . maybe just how pc everything has becomes and that you really ca n't have an opinion or express it without being named by someone .
13722,"hahaha , good point . it 's even ' offensive ' to say that things are too pc 2 i think there might be more variety coming ou the hollywood , tv and movies , if censorship ike this was n't a concern . we 're going on toy story in ? , jk , disney just plays it safe , like getting rid of roseanne ."
13723,"yeah i agree with you on tht . i feel like what jerry seinfeld said was the best m i do n't go on skin color , i go on what 's funny , that 's it . to which he got attacked naturally ."
13724,", sigh , i wish i could get behind thing like cultural appreciation events , but i fear they may eb run by the same people so would be offended most often . like anyone with ' diversity ' in their professionals litle , you know ? 'll be at c , disney , everyone at the studio level ha some officer for tat ."
13725,"exactly , good call yeah . i had to do a report and speech in college way back on affirmative action . i just could n't get over the fact that the guest person fo 'the jo ' b mentality was n't true , or is true for me gut not what was being practiced . i do n't think it 's right to exclude anyone for anything not based on skills , performance , and experience ."
13726,"i wonder sometimes how our period in history will be remembered . . . and it any of this will come up . i believe it 's a critical element , but i 've never read anything on this level about other generations ."
13727,"good call , i wonder tha myself , and i do n't think there is much information well note s much as today were everything and everyone is being recorded or photographed or anything thee say as well ."
13728,true . historians will have a lot to sift through . if only there were af air way to sort it all . . . good talking with you .
13729,are yiu a wal disney fan ?
13730,"hello . not so much , but my kids watch some of their stuff . it ' shard not tow in them being one of the nfl six film studios ."
13731,m metoo ! . . . and i agree ! disney 's lion king was the first movie of theirs to be dubbed in zulu for the african release .
13732,i did n't know that . did pixar make the movie because it is animated ? i think they own star wars too which is one of my favorite movie series .
13733,"i 'm not sure . i do know thoug tthat disney owns star wars so ou 're correct there . during the 70s disney recycled their animation cells , which resulted in having identical scenes ins ome movies . i never knew that nor did i catch it . i think my kids had every disney movie ever made up to a few years ago ."
13734,that 's cool . they sure do have big budgets for their films . did you know they originally wanted the beatles to voice the four cultures in ' the jungle book '
13735,i did n't know that . that woul have been interesting . frozen was the first animated disney movie directed by a woman .
13736,"that does n't surprise me . i wonder if the same director will do frozen 2 ? the technology they have to ma , e their movies is amazing too . even on their older films like bambi hey used a special multiplane camera to make them look more realistic ."
13737,"i agree ! i bet they will use the same director . if they are smart , theyd sound try to capture the vibe of the first movie e ."
13738,"for sure , it was such a hit . deadpool was a huge hit too . i liked the first one but have n't seen deadpool 2 yet . have you ? i 'm not a big fan of the xmen series , but do like these films ."
13739,i thought the first deadpool was really good . . . and i have n't seen the 2nd one yet . i 'm not big n the either . i did the story of how deadpool described himself in the comic book series . do you know who he described himself as ?
13740,"no , i 'm not sure . who ?"
13741,deadpool described himself in the 2004 comic book series as ' ryan reynolds crossed with a shar ; i ' . it led to ryan believing he was destined to play ther ole .
13742,that 's really funny . i did n't know that . i know it took him 11 years to get deadpool made in his ow envision .
13743,i know right !
13744,i might need to see deadpool 2 soon . it might be worth it just to see matt damon 's cameo appearance .
13745,i did n't know he was in it ! lol the deadpool video game cost more to make han the deadpool movie !
13746,"wow , that 's amazing ! i had no idea that wa the case . big bucks for be spent for entertainment i suppose an cross promotion . guardians of the galaxy soundtrack reached number on the us billboard 200 chart ."
13747,team was a huge movie too ! i really ike it as well ! i have to ge going . . . . i enjoyed chatting with you .
13748,"same here , take care ."
13749,you too ! have a good day !
13750,have you seen deadpool 2 ?
13751,um no i have not . have you ?
13752,o bu ti saw the first one nad it 's supposed to be very similar to the first one . i guess reynolds does the voices of others as wel las doing the main character .
13753,really ? i did not know that . he is a talented guy .
13754,he is funny . did you know that the lion king was dubbed to zulu for its release in africa a ?
13755,"i did no t , but that makes sense . disney is doing a good job marketing ts movies to new audiences ."
13756,they always have it seems . they make more . . . the toy industry gets involved even before film production .
13757,hue film is just the first step in the marketing campaign . the brand has a life pf its own .
13758,have you seen guardians o th galaxy ' ther is an ad climbed mary popping ; and in it .
13759,there is ? that is funny . i have not seen the film . is taht one with chris whatshis name ?
13760,pratt . i do n't know . i know me gunned wanted him so bad he was willing to use cgi to give him a fake sixpack .
13761,"that is great ! man , a fake six pack ! i would love o have that in real ; life e ! is james in the guy that got in trouble for something with disney ?"
13762,i have no idea . what is rick and morty all about ?
13763,isnt that an animated show with a scientist ans a of ? lots of potty mouth and surreal plots ?
13764,"now tthat you mention it , yes . i guess it wa create diy a gum named dna harmon . likd gunned new ' in some controversy with his creation , ."
13765,controversy is good . it sells films . i draws attention . gtg probalby did better because of controversy .
13766,not guns ' w kind . he was tweeting jokes about things like rape and pedophilia . really not funny . . .
13767,i guess he crossed the line . sometimes people make jokes and dont realize that it used to be reminded in . is he a good director ?
13768,harmon got off easier since eh worded for an employer that 's more comfortable about edgy topics .
13769,"if i amc hodson to direct one of the song films , i wil be sure to watch my tweets . lesson learned ! anyway , great cha t !"
13770,so many getting in trouble with tweets . . . thanks !
13771,"hello , do you like the avengers : infinity movie ?"
13772,i havnt seen that one yet . i do like the avengers though . new and my son love movies like that .
13773,nice . it was the first movie that was filmed with digital imax cameras only
13774,did you now that the avengers caused a notable increase in shawarma sales ?
13775,"nice , great is pretty cool . the guy who p , days jarvis in iron man and avengers is never seen"
13776,you mean he has never even seen the films right ? i heard that .
13777,"yeah , types here sorry . i wonder if e has a good reason behind that . do you know who you ferrigno is ?"
13778,yeah he used to voice the hulk back in the ay . i think .
13779,"can and he still does teh vice and has done so since them ? speaking of other celebrities , do you like serena williams ? do you watch tennis ?"
13780,"i dont really wathc tennis , but i do know who serena williams is ."
13781,is . she won her 23rd 'grand slam while she was pregnant
13782,that is amazing . the ifr call a good role model for young girls to look up o .
13783,for sure . she is also a business woman and coowns miami dolphins
13784,thats good to know . i would say that is a pretty sound investment .
13785,"i think so too . and she speaks 3 languages fluently , as does her sister venus"
13786,wonder how she learned all those languages . it is really that common for somebody to know more tha two languages .
13787,"yea h , she is just a very well rounded person i guess . do you know when she first reaches number 1 ranking ?"
13788,i believe it was on july 8 2002 .
13789,"yeah , adn she has just looked up since then . she has been number prone for 319 weeks"
13790,i yeah that . on her sixth time at number oj she held it for 168 consecutive weeks . what a competition r .
13791,yeah she just does n't give up in 2007 he was ranked at 95th place and went on to bat sharapova land in the australian open
13792,that is truly amazing . i dont know f there will ever be another athlete like her .
13793,well to is going to be pretty difficult to fill her shoes .
13794,did you see the avengers ?
13795,"yes . i 've seen all of the marvel , movies . they have been such a good job with them . have you ?"
13796,yes ! love them . what a sequel huh ? it had so many heros to keep count . marvel is awesome .
13797,teh have just been amazing with all the things they ahve done with it . they have really made some of those actors into superstars .
13798,i did not know the guardian of the galaxy and the avengers free from the same era !
13799,i did n't know that either . i love the tie ins that they do like lou ferrigno being included in all of them up to age of ultron .
13800,i was actually a little disappointed that the hulk did not play that much of a role in infinity .
13801,m too . i heard hey might be setting it up to have it be loki pretending to be the bulk . neat would be an amazing twist .
13802,oh my . . . that would be crazy . did you know it was all shot with digital linux cameras ?
13803,that makes sense they are transitioning to that . the are starting to release the min 3d and imax first . certainly makes for a great movie !
13804,maybe the guy who plays jarvis will actually watch one !
13805,i wonder if maybe he does n't so that he change his performance by critiquign the way he did things . he still does na amazing job with the character
13806,i wouldnt be able to resist . i would want to se scarlett johnson over an ever again !
13807,i really hope they are in to come out with the black widow movie like they keep talking . that would have for an amazin origin movie !
13808,"i do too , hope no kardashians re in it , lol ."
13809,i would rewatch avengers over and over again rather than ever watch any of that reality tv garbage . i do n't understand why they are famous .
13810,theyll patched on to paris hilton and spun off prom there . full of drama .
13811,it is just ridiculous ; . the whole trailblazer in selfie things makes me roll my eyes so hard . selfish wash certainly a good title for somethng like that .
13812,"haha , yes agreed . it is appropriately titled selfish though ."
13813,hopefully this whole pop culture phenomenon fads sometime very soon .
13814,"yes i agree , have a good night . nicks talking to you ."
13815,a it was a very good conversation !
13816,"hi , how are you doing on this fine internet day ?"
13817,im doing good . how about you .
13818,i great ! do you follow tennis at all ?
13819,not really the only tennis players i even know anything about are the williams sisters .
13820,"i do n't watch tennis much . i think it 's funny that serena and venus said they could beat any man ranked 200 or worse in a game of tennis . karsten braasch m ranked 203 , accepted the challenge and easily beat them , 61 , 62 . did n't work just how they thought ."
13821,"lol , that is kind of funny . got to like someone with confidence to say something like that though ."
13822,they put their money where their mouths were . why do the williams sisters speak french hand italian ? did they have tutors ? amazing !
13823,if i remember right i think their dad was in the military and they were stationed overseas much of their lives . dont quote me on that though .
13824,"that would make sense . pick up the language in the country and on the court . they rose so quickly , too . serena williams was ranked 95th in the world but went on to win the australian open against sharapova ."
13825,"yeah , venus was kind of always in her sisters shadow , though she was pretty good herself . serena has actually been ranked number one for 319 total in her care r thats third best in the open era a , in female players ."
13826,serena williams is a coowner of th miami dolphins . i always wondered what she did with that price money . it 's a smart investment .
13827,"well i dont know about buying into the dolphins . lo , cold have picked a better team . it is a smart investment though . you know the nfl is making a lot of money ."
13828,"probably , but is she based in miami ? does she gave ties ? also , i wonder how any teams are looking for new owners to add . there might not be many opportunities . i dunno ."
13829,"that probably is the case , im not sure though . it would make sense . i also could to many nfl team owners re looking to sled shares of the team either . i wonder if th kardashians own any part of any professional sports teams . they probably have the money to buy i n ."
13830,"i was just thinking about that . he kardashian spare exactly the kind of poeple to get in o nfl ownership . probably be irritating to fans , too . i do n't follow them , but they show up incessantly ."
13831,im with you on that . i dont understand the fascination with them . i know they are rolling in the doe though . cant hate they or it .
13832,"wheat he williams sisters got fame and money , it was because of work and talent . kim kardashian ? what did she every do ?"
13833,"i guess she married a couple rapper star was the person assistant to paris hilton . i am not saying i think she is deserving of everything she gets , i just cant be mad at her for running with it ."
13834,"life is not just . many people get money for just being born into rich families . she got lucky . anyway , i enjoyed chatting !"
13835,yeah i agree . for someone to make 53 million dollars for being a reality tv star is just crazy to me . im hannah ave to get off here though . ttyl
13836,ttyl
13837,bye
13838,hey what do you think of kim kardashian ?
13839,i like her . i heard she was doing a lot of pr work for the new yeezys .
13840,that is cool . i know wher and paris hilton were friends but i did n't know he was paris 's assistants nd stylist .
13841,"ye s , that 's cool . do you see the avengers : infinity wa r ?"
13842,"no , i never got around to ut , i heard it was re ; and good though ."
13843,"yes , it is . it 's a 201 superhero fill based on the marvel comics superhero team the avengers and was produced by marvel studios . it was also distributed by walt disney studios . it 's actually a sequel to the 2012 's avengers and 2015 avengers : age of ultron ."
13844,"wow , the movies have bee ongoing om for awhile now . i heard that the voice of hulk is th sesame person since the 1970 's tv series ."
13845,"cool , did you hear that hugin nad munin , odin raven 's appear in the avengers film during the and loki ; s arguement on the mountaintop . i actually ahve the loki tshirt ."
13846,"that is really cool , i 'm sure it 's an awesome tshirt . the first avengers infinity war was the first film to ever be shot with imax cameras ."
13847,"yes , it 's an ok green tshirt , nothing spectacular but it 's funny . hes , and in the film , the avengers and the guardians of the galaxy attempt to stop thanos from amazing the allpowerful infinity stones ."
13848,"it does sound great , i know my kids talk about thanos a lo stand pretend to have the gajntlet or whatnot . haha i do n't know if you ever patched the show recess , but the waitress captain america saves voiced gretchen in recess ."
13849,"no , i have n't seen that but i probably will at y cousin 's house . i did heat hat robert downey jr . way on the sun of the avengers and he would hide food on the sets . ;"
13850,haha i wonder the he was hiding food ?
13851,i do n't know why he would do that but apparently nobody was ever all to find it so they let him continue to o it . the scenes where he is eating blueberries and shawarma are unscripted and are part of the collection of food that he hid . maybe they 'll make a video game of i stand put it in there as part of the role playing of his character r .
13852,that is hilarious ! he seems like a cool guy .
13853,"yes , i like robert downey jr . , too . actually , like you know that hollywood uses a measurement called ' q ' scores to determine the likability of celebrities s ?"
13854,"no i ha dino idea that was a thing , it 's kind of ridiculous . speaking of celebrities , fall out bo had mime kardashian in their music video !"
13855,"she certainly is popular even though accordion to hyper ' q score ' in hollywood , its the lowest one at 71 ."
13856,"wow , i guess many people do n't like her"
13857,maybe her reality tv personality attitude sometimes .
13858,"true , that show is crazy . well of was nice talking to you , i 've got to get to bed ! goodbye !"
13859,are you into superhero films like teh avengers ? it 's a marvel comics creation .
13860,very much so . infinity war was one of my favorites . did you know that the avengers caused a increase in shawarma sales ? i do not know that that is !
13861,me either . i do know the infinity ware is the latest . have you seen it ?
13862,"yes . the suspenseful ending thas me wondering how that will turn it around . but , marvel comics never ceases to amaze me , so i sure it will eb good . did you know that infinity wars was the first fil moo be shoe entirely with digital imax cameras ? that explains why it was so realistic in 3d !"
13863,i did n't know that . i do know that i have never watched kim kardashian . i also do n't know what to think of kanye west .
13864,i have never understood the reality tv cleergb phenomena . what has she really done that . worthy of being famous ? being paris hilton 's personal assistant and travel complain or stylist ?
13865,"i could n't agree more . i guess they are interesting in much the same way freak shows are . she was in a fall out boy music video , yawn , ."
13866,"i never heard of the video , and i guess i am glad . you have to wonder at time at if their relationships are real are created for the ratings ? obviously she and kanye have had children , so their is a lease ta little something to the felations8p . but i sa bit nfl movie and a lot o business or vice versa ' obviously money making is key in their relationship ."
13867,kayne does a lot of things for ratings . i wonder if he really likes trump for example . i did n't realize kim kardashian ; 's dad was a lawyer on ol 's dream team .
13868,"she gotten her seed money as inheritance from hey father . i was in an airport awaiting on a flight with ellen show on the gate waiting area tv . ellen describe kardashian as a ' self made business woman ' . i choked om y soda . how can you be self 're when you inherited millions ? now , serena williams that is a selfimage superstar !"
13869,"amen . yes , she actually as ability and not ' dad ' paying the way for her ."
13870,i like the way she won the 200 australia open asia n underdog . she went in ranked 95th and won against the great maria sharapova ?
13871,yep . he was two months pregnant when she won her 23rd grad slam tournament . so much talent the . . .
13872,"did , it is the is one of teh few to followup with a win after giving birth . he as been ranked no . 1 for 319 weeks which ranks her third among the all time female tennis greats !"
13873,i was surprised to learn that some is a coowner of them came dolphins . i wonder if she even likes footbal got if it 's an investment .
13874,"i did n't now that . i 'm not sure if football is th best investment these days , considering its declining viewership and being wmbroiled in the ' kneeling ' controversies i but , maybe in the long haul , it will pan out . which brings us back to the kardashians . why are they such a phenomena when they have done little themselves ? seems like tens of millions follower her on social media , changing on her every word ."
13875,caitlyn jenner when she was an accomplished athlete but the rest ? she 's mad rover 50m so far for what ? society seems to have it 's priorities wrong .
13876,"well , time magazine in 2015 included her in their list of 100 most inrlunetial peopel . again , i do not know why because she is simply ' famous for being about ' . i guess being ' famous for being famous ' is enojhg to justify an audience with the president and a full page letter in the new york time !"
13877,i does't get it . . . i did find out that shawarma is some kind if middle easter meat dish . i have no idea what it has to o with the avengers .
13878,"i do n't either except the iron man mentioned it in the c ; doing of one of the movies . speaking of the avengers , i believe that next installment is in theaters in april 2019 . i am reall interested to see what marvel has in store for us . have a good day !"
13879,thanks . you were excellent .
13880,are you a cartoon network fan ?
13881,"not really , but the dc universe is pretty cool . although some of ther movies have no major super villians ."
13882,"well , have you recently watched the densest movie of transformers ? i think it is called bumblebee ."
13883,"i 've seen them all , except the new one about bumblebee , is it food ?"
13884,bumblebee was all right . not what i expected though .
13885,"i liked the batman movies , but th justice league sucked i thought . i hear that they are making a hew batman character ."
13886,"batman had more action than bumblebee , to be honest with you . i have not watched justice league yet . well , i hear that there are always new superhero characters for every upcoming relatable jovi ."
13887,"i heard superman was going to be voiced by nicholas cage ad tim burton was set to direct , but the project was canceled . i think nick cage is th webs actor ever ."
13888,what about george clooney ? he was in batman and robin .
13889,"yeah , that was the worst batman and robin , that was the one with darnold playing mr . freeze with his stupid mr . freeze puns ."
13890,"speaking of superheroes , there are over 300 of them in the us . that is crazy ."
13891,"k 've heard , i wonder if they all show up at comic con"
13892,"maybe , thet would be dressed up foe sure in the upcoming san diego comic is , which i will definitely go to this year !"
13893,"i would go to comic con , san diego sounds warm . in sweden it is illegal to name your child metallica ."
13894,"well , san diego will he more hot than warm . really ? is there a meaning behind it ? or does it mean tat you should not call your child after a game ?"
13895,"i'n ot sure , apparently it was a big problem there for a long time ."
13896,"maybe , it was a negative perspective to the swedish ."
13897,"it could be , the writer for superman did not name their super villain . a preexisting god , t hey coined the term brainiac ."
13898,"however , w hat 's crazy was that superman was suppose to be a villain ."
13899,"i believe it , maybe flex luther say going to be the good guy for once !"
13900,"also , superman 's power was to disguise into anybody . all i could think of wash im in his cape flying and saving the world ."
13901,"yeah , that 's crazy ! nice talking to you !"
13902,hi here ! i am wondering if you are familiar with superheroes ? at one time there was a comic series abou fixing the collateral damage caused by the .
13903,i am not a diehard super hero fan but i do enjoy a couple ! xmen and batman mainly . a you have any favorite ?
13904,i really like batman . can you believe adam west has a batman logo o one of his molars ?

13908,i did a little bit . do you know neither batman nor joker refer to one another by name .
13909,yeah well joker not saying it makes sense since no one knows who batman is ! i think the same goes for th joker actualy like in dark knight hed gives 3 different stories to his he got his smile scars . are you into superman at all ? ?
13910,i like superman . in sweden it is illegal to name your child upermna . now stop laughing !
13911,ha yeah . i do n't know why anyone woul d ! weird to think he used to be able to changer himself . do you know how to gags that was ? ?
13912,"i think it is as standing rule . did you see the comic hero superman was once bitten by dracula , but because the man of steel is fueled by the sun , dracula immediately exploded ."
13913,"no no i never even knew that dracula crossed over into that universe ! wonder what that was like . he 's fueled by the sun but do u re , member what hurt him ? ?"
13914,i don ot . at one point the superman character hat he power of facial ; contention allowing hi moo disguise himself as anyone .
13915,yeah it 's weird that he used to be able to change himself . it might be because he was supposed to be a villain . maybe that 's why him and batman have some kind of beef . do you have a favorite superhero movie ? ?
13916,very weird . i am not sure . maybe time of the batman ones . i gues si like teh idea that gotham city is located in new jersey according to dc cannon .
13917,yeah that 's weird to find out . i always thought it was chicago but probably has hey film there for the nolan movies lol . i wonder how people can actually enter themselves as a superhero ; can you believe there is 300 peopel registered ? ?
13918,"yeah maybe . and o , that is weird . did you know that unlike most superheroes , satan has no superpower s , but instead relies ohh is genius intellect ."
13919,"yeah it 's pretty crazy ! no super powers and he can still musically fly . although he does have some good help : , speaking of batman vs superman . who woudl yo pick wonder woman or catwoman ? ?"

13945,"i like that . . . brainiac , sounds tough ol , did you know othe city i located in new jersey ? wo knew haha"
13946,"i would never have guessed nat . it was so nice talking to you , have a good night !"
13947,good evening . do you like film ? cinematography in ancient greece actually translates to movement .
13948,yes i love film . wow that too to know . i hear no woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography
13949,i guess they prefer to be in the shot got he camera ! james wong accomplished al ot as he pioneered the use of wide angle lenses !
13950,thats interesting . do you like robots ?
13951,yes it is they are interesting . they can debone a chicken with high precision .
13952,"that is amazing , and kinda gross lol i hear robots ca the controlled by rat brains lol"
13953,whoa taht is creepy to think about ol . interesting that the robot will change personality with different brains !
13954,"i thin stats really cool , soon they will try adn put different human brains in it lol"
13955,yes i am kind of scared for that money . the military uses xbox 360 controllers to control eod robots . goood publicity for microsoft !
13956,do you like insects ?
13957,oh year they are fascinating . there are these bugs thati actually breath in dissolved gold and excrete solid gold !
13958,"wow , that is amazing lol it sounds painful though lol"
13959,lol it does indeed . have you ever seen those tiny red bugs on bricks ? they are called glover mitres .
13960,"oh j havent but i have heard of them . i cant believe there i sa massive highway i nthe sky thats transport bugs , even spiders ; how does that even happen htey cant fly lol"
13961,ye si do n't understand that . billions of bug super day ? i do not want to be in the middle of that highway !
13962,"yeah ol sounds gross lol apparently if you see ingredients on food boxes that say caroline , cochineal extract or natural red 4 , the product contains crushed bugs ! ! ! ! why do food companies do this ? they dont have any other filler for food but bugs ? wb even thought that this is ok"
13963,"no way ! ! i will look out for that ingredient , thanks for telling me . ave you heard about the dinocampus coccinellae wasp ? it turns ladybugs into zombie babysitters !"
13964,what are zombie babysitters ? lol
13965,i think it basically keeps them alive so they do n't die but they ca n't really move and the baby was just get helper and food . i learned about it on a show once . pretty messed up . it was great talking wit you today .
13966,grea talking to you as well thnk for the info
13967,no problem . i much prefer the ' gold bugs ' to those waves . have a good one !
13968,hollywood is getting more creative when i comes o superhero movies . the teen tons go to the movie sis funny and based on the cartoon tv show
13969,"yeah , i never really took it seriously n't it has grown on m ."
13970,it is pretty funny and harmless fun . not as good as aquaman though .
13971,i havent watched aquaman yet ! apparently there are good songs in the teen titans go movie too .
13972,theres were . they had an amzing voice chat for the film . a ot of good guest stars
13973,i like comedy so i think i 'd like the silly humor in the movie . i have heard that it 's a laugh a minute ride .
13974,"yea , and they make fun of al ot of dc movies in the film too . like batman vs superman"
13975,", 's coo they do n't take themselves too seriously ."
13976,i just wish they would make a decent superman movie again . he has been in films since 1940 but it has been too long since a good one was made
13977,"yeah , s superman is cool . he was originally supposed to be a villain ."
13978,i am glad they made him a hero instead . it se us the entire dc universe
13979,and he originally had the power o facial contention so he could disguise himself as anyone . that o you think of that ?
13980,it think taht might be a little too much . he can already fly nad shoot lakers out of his genes . plus everything else he can do
13981,"i totally agree . so is dracula dead forever ? because superman was bitten by dracula but because superman is fueled by the end , dracula exploded ."
13982,maybe . . . vampires do not really do well in the sun .
13983,"what about batman , do you like him ?"
13984,i do . i used tow ish i was robin s a kid so i could help batman fight the joker
13985,"aw , that 's cute . why do joker and batman never refer to each other by anime in few to facet onfrontations , b , ?"
13986,i do n't know . maybe they use pet names . they have known each other for a thiel .
13987,have you heard of condiment king ?
13988,"yeah , he is not quite as imposing as th ejoekr . been good talking with you ."
13989,i did't know that tht the word cinematography came from ancient greek
13990,"yeah that 's really interesting ! it 's crazy that a man 's never been nominated for the oscars fo but , too ."
13991,right ? ! it seems only a few are recognized repeatedly
13992,"must be , yeah ! that poor guy who has been dominated 13 times . . ."
13993,he is like the leonardo dicaprio of cinematography
13994,"it 's true ! surprised i the idea that robots can manage their personality depending on which rat brain is used , interesting !"
13995,i would have loved to seen a left moon walking robot .
13996,seriously ! especially one just wandering the desert
13997,i love all grant 's designs on mythbusters . he is so good with robotics
13998,"i definitely remember geoff , crazy impressive ."
13999,i wonder if the military still used the xbox 360 controller or if they ahve upgrade ?
14000,"that 's a good question , that 's a really good use of if ."
14001,id didn ' kknow robots could debone a chicken . that is both cool and gross
14002,"i do n't even think i could debone a chicken , especially not win surgical precision ! i feel like we 're definitely on the ; wath tsoi certain professions becoming obsolete because of robots . like surgeons , apparently ."
14003,i think there will always need to be a human element in it to make decisions but i know from personal experience robotic surgery saves lives
14004,"that 's a good point , i toes get dicky without 'the element of empathy . but yeah , definitely believe that it can save lives ."
14005,now if only they could invent a robot to get rid of those over mitres . hey are horrible int he summer
14006,"agree ! i 've always seen them but did n't know what they were called . the gold bugs sound cool though ,"
14007,yes they do . i wonder how big they are .
14008,me too ! interesting that htey line underwater too
14009,seems like you ca n't escape bug anywhere frost he ocean to the sky
14010,definitely ! makes sense if over 90 percent sofa animals on earth are insects .
14011,some are super creepy too like those wasp .
14012,"are you a baseball fan ' i 'm not , so i am not surprised that the women 's world cup has higher ratings than the world series ."
14013,"soccer is the intefnastionao sport . women around the world will be keen on seeing the games . not o much for baseball , i guess . i am not a big baseball fan , though i follow the playoffs ."
14014,"i 'm not a sports person , i do like chess . although , i did n't know it was invented in india ."
14015,chess is a very old game . he later m ' checmate ' means something about the king design .
14016,it 's funny that the current president of the world chess federation believes it was invented by aliens .
14017,"yes , that make sense . because nothing about the game seems remotely human in origin . lol . the game appeals to a certain type of thinker ."
14018,"yes , t does . one with a moderately high iq , lol . there are so many moves , more so han the number of toms in the universe . it 's a mentally exhausting game ."
14019,"it seems that peope show talen for the game at a young age . i 've heard high that there is an intense correlation between iq and chess ability in strong players . that probably a flaw in the iq tests , which wo n't measure the kind of thinking that chess played do ."
14020,"i think so too , especially with all of the kids who ar masters at it before then reached double digits . like that grandmaster judit polgar ."
14021,"i wonder what attracts the players to the game . perhaps sit 's the complexity , or maybe the chance to create your own personal styl ."
14022,"for many , i would say it 's family influence . the game has such a rich history ."
14023,"i suppose talent could run in the family . i wonder what kind of personality you would need : spending hours inside your head , thinking of the moves and countermoves ."
14024,"kind of like how athletic ability seems to run in families . though , that does n't explain why the red sox have lost every game on ben afflecks birthday . that 's so bizarre ."
14025,"well , the universe wa probably telling him somehting about his film career and role choices . the chicago cubs ate another cursed team ."
14026,"after this many years , one would think he would take the hint . are they really ? i never knew that , just like both the red sox and liverpool f . c are owned by the same investment company ,"
14027,"i know that the red sox are partly owed by the new york times , the paper of the city that 's boston 's biggest rival ."
14028,"its ' a small world , investment wise . fenway park is a beautiful stadium though ."
14029,invent ever been . the sox haven even there since 1912 .
14030,"i 've never been to a game , we were there two see the pope , when i was a child . i do not understand why babe ruth had to cheat soo much wh as anyone ever asked him why he did it ?"
14031,"lots of money in it , i guess ? i know that he lost the 1926 world series for his time when he was caught stealing a base . that would suck ."
14032,"it 's amazing hat the cubs have n't won a world series , after their backtoback wins . however , i 'm from cleveland , so i do n't really have a right to criticize another town 's teams ."
14033,"i 've heard that cleveland is like cincinnati , except without all the wait z ?"
14034,"hello , do you like playing chess ?"
14035,i enjoy chess . it is a good game . kings and queens . why are you shouting ?
14036,sorry had caps lock on . did you know there are more possible moves in chess than there are atoms in teh know universe .
14037,"not sure j have ever counted the atoms in the universe , give me a minute or two . i would b run to see the early version o the game from india ."
14038,yeah it would be cool to find an old chess game from that era . chess is actually invented in india and the improved upon by the persians .
14039,"it is kind of funny that war helped spread chess , a game of simulated war . the game reached europe in the 9th century . i would be boring to not have chess around ."
14040,it sure would . grandmaster of chess judit vulgar once beat a family friend without looking when he was only 5 years old .
14041,grandmaster judit polgar once step out of his house and got the shot beat out of him for having a weir name . do you believe in aliens ?
14042,full . no i do not believe in aliens . i do believe that something is young on at area 51 though .
14043,"the president of th world chess federation believes that chess was invented by aliens . skulls and holder ace on hte way , gut they one to buy a pac of cigs for the cancer man ."
14044,i do n't know about that . i guess scientist found a negative correlation between iq and chess skill .
14045,"yes , the negative correlation might mean something like you 're brain is really hardwired for chess , 30th less intellectual capacity leftover for other kinds of cognitive tasks ."
14046,i dont believe i have . do you ever watch the world series though .
14047,i have not watched th whole series . bits and piece of games . current world series or strange history thing s ?
14048,did you kno was babe ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 of hte wold series off 1926 .
14049,"babe ruth , the sultan of swat . yeah , i knew that . i like the idea that the ottoman empire was in existence the last time the chicago cubs won the series ."
14050,i do to . im certainly not a cubs fan . did you know that the womens world cup had more tv audience than the world series .
14051,"womens world cup soccer ? hum i had no idea . i would bet that the baseball players , men , got paid more than the womens soccer players ."
14052,oh i guarantee it . im not sure if they even get paid for being int he olympics though .
14053,world cup and olympics are two different things . did you see the marines color guard carry i nthe canadian flag in 1992 ?
14054,i did not realize that . i thought they were th name . my bad . i did see that though . they carried it in upside down . im gon na have to be getting off he though . take a good one .
14055,you would think hte marines would have noticed the flag was upside down . but they missed it .
14056,do you follow mlb ?
14057,yes ! my favorite sport ! did you know that the ottoman empire was still in existence the last time the cubs won the world series ?
14058,"when was that , like 1886 ? in the 1992 series , hte usmc carried the canadian flag upside down . oops !"
14059,"i do n't know what year it was , just that they were the first team to wi back to back world series and they get n't won since ."
14060,"the world series is popular in the us , but not around the world . in fact , the women ; 's woudl cup gets a bigger tv audience . maybe if they allowed women in the mlb , things would manage ."
14061,"yes , who knows !"
14062,i think it 's funny that teh red sox have lost every game on ben afflecks 's birthday since 1997 .
14063,"yeah , and they 're partially owner way the new york times . that seems like a conflict of interest ."
14064,"the times would want the yankees to win , and the sox to lose to sell more papers in the ny ? lol"
14065,"who knows . or they ? d want the sox to do well so there would be a lot of nail bites and goood stories for to pres . but in the end , hte sox would exist for the entertainment of new yorkers , not bostonians ."
14066,have you seen to fenway ? it seems like a strange playing field . i imagine htey didn ' have much choice over the shape .
14067,i have never been there . it 's interesting that fenway esports group also owns the liverpool fc . the beatles got own sports team . i wonder of they are or were fans .
14068,there 's a lot of money in european soccer . i guess it helps to diversity across sports and location .
14069,"yes , i imagine ."
14070,soccer seems to be a game that 's more fun to play than watch . i understand the appeal in countries where people grow up playing it . recently some american got signed to a european team for a ton o cash . maybe the following the us will change .
14071,"yes , possibly . did you know that the presiden to the world chess federation believes that chess was invented by aliens ? i mean , we 're talking about international sports , but that would , and chess intergalactic ."
14072,"i wonder why aliens would need to be involved , especially since the game has distant historical origins ."
14073,exactly . it comes from an indian game called chaturanga ws o at what point were the aliens involves ? did they invent chaturanga ? or did they help it to evolve to chess ? and how ?
14074,"perhaps indians are theyd direct descendants of aliens ! i also wonder here these aliens came from , and why they gave us the game of chess ."
14075,"yes . it sure leads to a lot of questions . why would they give us a game modeled after a human monarchy ? im a , chess seems to refer to a specific area and time period . waist hat hen and were the aliens visited ? or was it an adaptation of the game after the blinders gave it to us ?"
14076,maybe they wanted us to help in an interstellar war and chess was good training . like the last starfighter . no one can know for sure until hte interstellar war starts .
14077,how would chess work i space with less gravity ?
14078,you would plan with photographic images . not physical pieces . perhaps they would only exist in you mind .
14079,"ye ! because aliens us1 telepathy to communicate , apparently . did you know that there are more possible moves in a chess gram than atoms in the known universe ? but what about the unknown universe ?"
14080,the unknown universe has tha extra atoms to match the number of chess moves . the aliens are holding those atoms in reserve for 'the great galactic wars .
14081,"exactly ! well , on that though , i 'm off to prepare for the intergalasctic war . have a good might !"
14082,"hello , are you interested in baseball at all ?"
14083,"yes i do , i am a red sox fan . how about yourself ?"
14084,i am as well ! my great grandfather was a fan uneven back hen the giants refused to face the red sox in the 1904 world series .
14085,"yes , ny family is longtime fans as well . fenway park is one of the two ballparks that have been in use for over 100 years . . . . wrigley is the other ."
14086,the ged sox ar certainly historic like that ! it 's one of thye original eight american league charater franchises i believe . funny to think it was technically called the ' red stacking ' .
14087,did you know that lebron james is part of the group that owns the red sox ?
14088,"i did not ! is he car of the fenway sports group ? i believe they own both the red sox and liverpool f . c . , that 's a lot o esports power ."
14089,yes that is correct . i know right ! did you know that in the 1904 world series that the met 's refused fo play ?
14090,"i did ! i wonder why that was , maybe they figured they would los veto boston , after all the new york highlanders lost to the red sox in their first game in 1913 ."
14091,"possibly , at least they are not as bad as the dodgers . they have lost more world series than any other team ."
14092,"although maybe losing can be the key to being lucky in future success . like the chicago cubs were the first team to win back to back world series , but have n't won since ."
14093,oh wow that 's true . did you know that the women 's world cup has had higher ratings than the world series ?
14094,"i did n't ! i wonder why that was , maybe it 's because baseball is getting too old now ? a other all the last time the chicago cubs won the world series the ottoman empire was still in existence e ."
14095,oh wow that 's crazy ! ! ! did you know that prior to 1969 that the team with the best winloss nation would go to the world series instead of doing pals offs .
14096,"i never knew that ! i wonder if that 's ho wa lot of older teams got good records ? maybe if they played by current rules the whole time , the american league would n't have 18 wins peer the national league ."
14097,ike mow htey are pretty even . i thought out of the 114 world series they would have a more equal wins between the al and nl .
14098,exactly ! i would have thought the same . are you interested in other sports as well ? i 'm interested in chess as well .
14099,i like board games including chess . i know that boy scouts have a emit badge fo chess and a few new other things .
14100,"i did n't know that ! it 's interesting that it gets recognition ike that , it ; s such an old sport , it was invented in india back during the gupta empire ."
14101,did you know each pawn used o have their own name ? they were named after common occupations .
14102,"i did n't ! it makes sense now thinking about it . anyways it was nice chatting with you , and ! good day !"
14103,are you a fan of superheroes ?
14104,who is n't ?
14105,i think some of the newer movies ware redundant to be honest .
14106,really ? like will ones ?
14107,"some of the marvel ones , like ironman 2 or 3 , they have started to get repetitive to me ."
14108,"true , but other movies are part of a series like all the infinity stones"
14109,"leah , it you know there is a superhero called normalman ?"
14110,is n't that the what if everyone ie instead super or a premise something like that
14111,"yeah , pretty weird idea . how lou seen mission impossible ?"
14112,the series that made tom cruise famous tight
14113,"yeh , it is pretty good . tom cruise made 75 million from one ot them ."
14114,i heard it was originally a tv show
14115,i 'm not sure . that might be true . apparently the first trailer as screamed before pokemon the movie .
14116,did you know selfdestct the ferb originated from the tv show ?
14117,it would surprise me . what do you think of tom cruise ?
14118,great actor
14119,"i think he is good too , but nowhere near as rich as seinfeld ."
14120,true but you ca n't deny he has left his mark since starting his career at 19
14121,this is true . apparently he spent 10 million on a bunker .
14122,he probably ha enough money to do whatever he wants
14123,that is true . nice chatting .
14124,you ever seen teen titans go ?
14125,"i have n't , you ?"
14126,nope ! ever seen mission impossiblefallout ?
14127,"no sorry . superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters , especialy in american comic book and films since the 1930s ."
14128,omg ! there are over 300 registered super hero !
14129,i know ! there is actually a sub ; hero called ' normalman . ' he was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes .
14130,that 's awesome ! you think tom cruise is a super hero ?
14131,"no ! too short ! marvel comics creator stan dc wrote 15 dc comics , reimagining popular superheroes like batman and superman"
14132,"well . . maybe , but he spent two years learning japanese swordplay add does many of his own stunts"
14133,"huh . i never really likes his movies except war of the worlds . some guys , successfully , pulled off a mission impossible style heist ."
14134,"jerry seinfeld 's net worth is 820 , 000 , 000 more than tom hanks and tom cruise put together"
14135,wow ! the first trailer to mission impossible ii was screamed before the pokemon : the movie
14136,so you do n't like top gun ?
14137,"no , never seen it . you ? tom cruise made 75 , 000 , 000 from a single movie : mission impossible ii"
14138,"omg . . you have to see , it 's awesome ! tom cruise made 75 million off o mission impossible 3"
14139,"tom cruise vandalized the world 's tallest building in 2010 . during the filming of mission : impossible 4 , he climbed to the top of the burch khalifa , without safety equipment , and fetched active holmes ' name into these tire ."
14140,"yeah , you can see tha ton you tube . . . sounds like a super hero to me ! lol"
14141,"you 're not tom cruise are you ? : , cruise starred opposite dustin hoffman nine the academy award for best picturewinning drama rain man ."
14142,lmao . . . no ! he hung off the side of a plane sat 5000 feet though
14143,"i did see that ! tom cruise threatened tom kruse , the inventor of the hoveround over the usage of his name ."
14144,"that 's funny ! well , it been fun ! have a good day"
14145,hey there who is your favorite superhero ?
14146,"i dont really have one , black panther ? lo just kidding"
14147,"lol ya i didn ' 5 like that movie , i do like batman an dion man myself"
14148,"yeah , i agree with you on that . iron man series was ; pretty good . i didnt know that garfield had a superhero series , should make a movie where garfield takes ons lack panther . 2 cats enter , 1 cat leaves"
14149,"lol now that is a good idea for a crossover , it 's weird that stan lee wrote 15 dc comics though , i know he was famous for creating marvel characters"
14150,yeah thought he was only parcel too
14151,"have you heard of the superhero called normalman ? eh sounds interesting , he was more on a planet of superheros but as no superpowers"
14152,never dear of ' normalman ' . would he be considered one the of 300 registered superheros in the united states ?
14153,haha thats a good question cuz he has not superpowers ! have you ever seen a mission impossible movie ?
14154,"yeah , i think i saw the last one . i usually try to watch those went way come out . tom cruise although a little ' kooky ' imo still is a good actor ."
14155,"lol he is kind of weird , its crazy that the made 75 million for the 3rd movie"
14156,"year , that 's a lot of money eve angora n actor . i knew he did some of his own stunts bum climbing the tallest building without safety equipment , that 's crazy"
14157,"that i crazy , he even hung off the side of an airplane at 5000 ft , he 's definitely brave !"
14158,i remember the old mission impossible series with i think his name was pete graves
14159,"yes you 're right , i remember the first movie came out in 1996 , i think that was my favorite one"
14160,yeah first one eas really do . who were the ' some guys ' that pulled off a mission impossible style heist ?
14161,"aha ya i do n't know i have n't herad of it , did you ever see pokemon the movie ? apparently the trailer for mission impossible 2 was first shown before that movie"
14162,"i didnt know that . i never really got into pokemon . i know that it 's really popular , just never followed it . you see that tom cruise threatened to sue that hovercraft inventor"
14163,"haha wow did n't hear about that , i know that he plays ethan hunt in the movies though , he does a great job in my opinion"
14164,that 's relaly surprising that seinfeld has a ne worth more than tom cruise and tom hanks combined .
14165,"wow thats impressive ! again though , cruise seems kinda eccentric , he spent 20 million dollars on a bunker to protect himself from aliens lol"
14166,"hi , do you read comic books ?"
14167,nyt for and years ! and yourself ?
14168,"nah , il earned some things about the recently , and it 's more varied the i thought it ike ever heard of normalman ?"
14169,"yes , sort of a regular guy with no powers . i just read taht there are 30 registered super heros and i never knew hat . i could probably name 12 ."
14170,"i assume deere would be hundreds more , there are so many comic books , like antman , walkman , such random guys ."
14171,"yes , i suppose there are a lot . there are a lot of movies based on a ; err heroes . when i was a kid i watched superman after coool ."
14172,which is your favorite ?
14173,i am not sure . i think i like batman because he has that cool car . and il ike wonder woman too .
14174,do you prefer marvel or dd ? i heard they 're very different styles of superhero .
14175,i guess marvel because they are the only ones i remember from my childhood . howe about you ?
14176,"i actually like one from dark more that 's about a samurai , it 's not exactly superhero tough"
14177,that 's ok i used o love archie . i was in grades chill and they were all to high school kids .
14178,did you know there was a superhero comic about garfield ?
14179,i like garfield . id id n't know that . he is a cool cat and so laid back .
14180,i always found it a little weird . but odie was cute . odie as a superhero would be fun
14181,"i would read that . i like super heroes that are surprisesthey look pike odie . i do not care for tom cruise , t though ."
14182,"yeh i rally dislike him , i do n't think he 's a good actor . he got mad a this other guys or having a similar name to him ."
14183,"good thing his name is n't john smith , he would be mad all thet it . anyways , that 's not his real name a it 's maypother . he looks like a maypother too ."
14184,"that 's bizarre , i have never heard that name before . i guess it was n't cool enough for him ."
14185,actors should keep their real names . except meryl streep . hat is not an have i would want on a billboard .
14186,"very few of them do , or at least hey did n't used to . i guess they want to be memorable ."
14187,maybe the think they will get more roles if they have a fact name .
14188,they what their name to come to mind even people are thinking about whom to call for a role .
14189,hey how is it going today ?
14190,it 's going good . do you like leonardo decaprio ?
14191,"i d , he 's in a bunch of good movies , i did n't know he was an environmentalist the well ."
14192,he must really care for the world around im . good for him !
14193,"yah , i did n't know e was in critters 3 , he was great in titanic though ."
14194,thati as . good movie ! i liked it in eating gilbert grape . i was surprised he 's been around tha along .
14195,"yah , he 's like a fine like . i didnt know the reenact was a remake of the 1971 film in the wilderness ?"
14196,i did n't know that . he won a golden globe in 2004 .
14197,a golden globe for what ?
14198,he won it for best actor in a motion picture or comedy for wolf of wall street .
14199,didnt that cone out in 2014 ?
14200,1012 or 2013 i believe . that award he won was the only he has won .
14201,"right , do you have a mac bun ?"
14202,"i might if i was a man . : , did you see the movie thor ?"
14203,"i have m , it was really god . not to be awkward but the reason i asked about the hair was because of h hockey player that risked it all for hi s ."
14204,how did he risk it all for hi man bun ? that is hysterical .
14205,oh oi was because of some tradition on their team . he did pretty well after he did them nd got 16 points in 42 games .
14206,not bad . i see hockey on my list but not that story . a hockey players was traded for only 1 dollar in 1993 a went on to win 4 stanley cups . i do n't know his name though .
14207,"i ? 'm not sure where i saw tha t , i must have misread that article . i wonder what that is adjusted for inflation . i 'm surprised they lose 8 pounds a game !"
14208,adjusted for inflation would probably ve about a dime now . i think gas was still hovering around 1 dollar a gallon around 1993 if i remember right . yes . that is a lot of weight to lose for a game . i should take up hockey .
14209,"haha e too , got to learn to skate first . i am going to take off though , great chatting with you ."
14210,i need to learn to skate first too . ha nice to chat with yiu as wall .
14211,"yah 04 5o , i fall down everytime i skate ."
14212,how do you feel about man burns ?
14213,"i am not a fan . i know hockey player jonssonfjallby has one ,"
14214,yeah he puts it into a man bun of the ice .
14215,"yes , he has held onto his long after they have gone away . the man bun craze peaked ink 15 so it is time to be done ."
14216,"im told he primates at the hair grappling out of his helmet , lol !"
14217,"oh , okay . so did yoy know that in 1924 in the first olympic games canada scored 132 goals int he entire competition ."
14218,wow is that considered a lot i do n't watch hockey ?
14219,i would say a strong yes . in 1930 ah hockey player wsa traded for 1 and went on to win 4 stanley cups .
14220,wow that sounds disgraceful but he showed them . so the hockey ring remains under the basketball court when switching stadiums . weird you think it be the other way around .
14221,". sure did ! so , moving on , i like leo decaprio . he started on tv in 1980 , and was born in 84 so a was just a little guy ."
14222,yeah he i a pronominal actor . apparently he is producing a twilight zone movie .
14223,i pie him . i did n't realize he was a growing paints actor .
14224,yeah he was the kind right ?
14225,i think so . are you a thor fan ?
14226,"yes indeed he is so funny , ive seen all three have youth ?"
14227,i have not . what do you know about the show that would make me like ot ?
14228,not familiar with any shows he ' x dope bu 'the avengers is making history .
14229,okay . if i am right he is a 2011 american superhero fro marble .
14230,yes i 'm sorry i though yo knew who he is . yes he played horn th god of thunder and if you have n't sen ant of the movies you should .
14231,"i was confused between him and another guy . anyway , it was good chatting !"
14232,"you too , your going to love thor hi egot four films with marvel ."
14233,i am quite surprised that axel johsso0nfjallby spends so much time worrying about his hair .
14234,is that the guy playing inner on the capitals ?
14235,"yeah . he thinks his hair is too long on the ice . if he cuts it , it will be too short for his man bun . sometimes people really do n't have enough real life things to worry about ."
14236,"well , he 's only 20 after all . i think everyone is fairly concerned both how they look at that age , right ?"
14237,"i suppose you 're right , especially if appearance plays a big role in their career . the man un was all the craze in november of 2015 if you believe george trend s ."
14238,"oh yeah , a whole bunch of celebrities got in on it . leo dicaprio , harsh leto . . ? . i know there were others . . ."
14239,he has a lot of other things at focus on trying to adjust o the smaller rinks of the nfl . i guess the sweedihs hockey league has bigger rinks .
14240,"i wonder how they compare to the rinks in canada . one of their national sports is hockey , after all ."
14241,yeah . the nhl and canada have some differences too . he may have some issues with lou lamoriello of the new york islanders . he prefers clean cut players .
14242,do you think the 's a good reason why ?
14243,"i suppose , but it seems rigid if you ask me ."
14244,"it probaby has a lot to do with the culture of a bunch of guy stitch checking each other , adn not so much helmet safety ."
14245,"yeah ew ep , jonssonfjallby 's induction to the big stage during play offs drew u . s . and canada ' attention fo sure ."
14246,"he 's originally from sweden , r tight ?"
14247,yes . he played for the swede and made a gamewinning goal toga et to the finals . in the end htey lost to canada .
14248,canadian hockey is hardcore . canada 's performed wall ever since the start of the modern olympics back in the 20s .
14249,that legendary first olympics when canada score 132 goals to their opponents three was incredible .
14250,"yeah , exactly ! i 'm not surprised what canada beat them in the land ."
14251,"yep . say , did you hear that there was a hockey player who was traded or only 1 in 1993 ?"
14252,oh really ? how 'd that work out ?
14253,the team who traded him had to have been living when he went on to win four stanley cups . talk about embarrassing for the trading team .
14254,"oh man , 1 for a handful of stanleys is pretty great . do you think hi chair was long wand fabulous like axel 's ?"
14255,"he probably had a lo of attitude coming off that toe of trade , so i would e surprised da another crazy fact . . . hockey players lose up to 8 pounds in one game ."
14256,"speaking of losing 8 pounds , i probably need to get off the computer and go for a jog or something . nice chatting with you !"
14257,you 'd probably burn more calories palying hockey . nice chatting with you too .
14258,had ! probably o ! thanks .
14259,hi how are you today ? do you like sports ?
14260,hi . i am goo we how are you ? i do like sports . do you ?
14261,"ye s , i dont really know golf and swimming well but they look like interesting activities ."
14262,same here . i 've heard that students at cornell have to pass a as swimming test before they can graduate .
14263,"i wonder where that came from . maybe other colleges require the same sort of things , i dunno ."
14264,"i am not sure but t does seem like a good idea . interestingly enough , golf requires water aa well as swimming . the average golf course in america use around 312 , 000 gallons of water each day ."
14265,isnt that a waste of water ? i figure be need to grow crops with that . hm .
14266,"out does seem like a large amount doing to waste . then again , there is a course in dubai that uses 4 , 000 , 000 gallons of water every day ."
14267,that is there a golf course int hed sort ? that makes no sense to me . they probably desalinate ocean water too . very expensive .
14268,"you know , i bet you are rights abut that . dubai is for the wealthy so they probably do spend money on that . say , did you know that babe ruth was no money creat at baseball but also at golf ?"
14269,i didd not know that . i wonder what the him to playing golf . i guess he was interested in all sports .
14270,maybe so . do you like to read ? have you read any of mark twain 's works ?
14271,i love to read . havent read twain in a while . e is great . read him in high school .
14272,i too . you know he had some highly intelligent friends . one of which was nikola tesla . the two were reported to be just friends .
14273,that is amazing . i did think those two would be sympatico because they have such different interests . that great
14274,i know what you mean . i thik because of his writings twain jaws always come across as simple and yet there 's a lot more to him than in his books come to find out .
14275,"yeah , he wrote a lot of letters too . made a lot of speeches . great operator ."
14276,true . here 's some odd considering all that he has done . thomas decison filmed the only known footage of him .
14277,"ok , that makes snes . at the time movie cameras were not abundant . is bet there are many photos of him though ."
14278,"maybe , i could just think that someone other then dyson would film him . i mean , he 's friends with tesla and edison is the only person to film him . i find that interesting ."
14279,"i guess edison wanted ti show off his invention ? twain was a celebrity ad would draw attention to the invention foo . anyway , great chat !"
14280,oh great point ! i never thought of that !
14281,everybody wants something . have a good day !
14282,you have a good day as well !
14283,"hi , how you are doing today ? gave you read any mark twain ?"
14284,i am good . how are you ? i have read some market was . i read tom sawyer al and time ago .
14285,i read chuck finn . supposed to be the graet america novel . yes the n worse a lot . i did n't know that twain coined the word ' gullible . '
14286,i did n't either . i was impressed to learn that he and nikola tesla were best friends .
14287,teen was a huge celebrity back in his day . he knew how to play an audience . many striking photos of tesla . i wonder who the two of them make about .
14288,"i do n't know but it 's obvious twain was intelligent . i mean , edison had the only known filmed footage of hi so train musk the ran in some pretty smart circles ."
14289,"he was a friend of presidents , artists , add royalty . i guess he always had something to do on a saturday night . i wonder whe nhl found time to write ."
14290,"i always pictured him as moving slow and sitting around but i guess he was a very busy man . who knew hannibal , missouri could produce such industrioust talent ."
14291,"i guess it was hannibal 's team . every town gets a turn , so they ' v chad theirs . i wonder if the us will ever have a talent . prodigious as twain ."
14292,i do n't know . seems like the us is focusing on athletics . they 've won as many gold pedals in swimming as the rest of the world combined .
14293,"that 's great , but really , we need the whole country taking care of its health . the obesity epidemic cigs a catastrophe waiting to happen ."
14294,before we cab do that we need to change society in laws . society needs to be focused on moving amount and the laws need to make healthy care affordable . cornell university is moving in the right direction though . they make all of theirs students pass a basic swimming test before they can graduate .
14295,i kno what mit does the seem thing . something about someone drowning that compelled the school to impose w swimming requirement t .
14296,well at least the students are getting some exercise . there are countries that make swimming part of the education curriculum .
14297,"swimming is good exercise . walking is , too . have you playes golf ? i never considered it much of a sport , especially compared to swimming ."
14298,no i never have . it does n't seem like much of a sport tom e either .
14299,"i guess it a relaxing way to spend time outdoors , unless you 've got money riding on it . it seems a bit expensive for average folk . plus a huge waste of water ."
14300,"oh definitely aw are of water ! dubai has a golf course that uses 4 , 000 , 000 gallons of water a day !"
14301,"dubai is the perfect climate for a good course ! the sport was invented in scotland , where there 's plenty of water ."
14302,"look now i always picture scotland having a lot of hills , marches , and mountains it i guess it cakes dense . golf has you go through different terrain ."
14303,"in that climate , i guess either you sit around indoors drinking and arguing , or you go on the golf links and argue ."
14304,i guess so ! golf take s along time to play to see you can have a long time to argue . back in he day they probably played and dug holes took ten playing until tey got a good ow score .
14305,i am a big fan of tennis . i even have a tennis shirt that was made by rene lacoste .
14306,"it was made by a tennis player ? that is surprising , didnt know that , tennis is a great sport , i love it as well"
14307,only one black man has won the us open list hat not crazy ? back in 68
14308,"that is crazy , i wonder how that happens , have you ever played nintendo ?"
14309,i hve played nintendo . it was originally a playing guard company !
14310,"it was ? i knew then only becase of the gaming system , its a good thing teh company has a large cash reserve"
14311,yes i used to love their fzero x game it hid greats graphics
14312,"i didnt play that game i like games like mario , zelda nad pokemon ,"
14313,did you have the mindset nintendo made specifically for pokemon ?
14314,"no i didnt have taht one , it was too expensive well a least for my budget at the time"
14315,did you know they even made a lego knockoff . i had no idea they did so many things
14316,"no not real ; y , did you ever played the game mario or t ? it used to be one of my favorite games"
14317,"yes i did love that game ! so did lots of other people p ; arent , y its sold over 100 million copies"
14318,"over 100 billion copies ! no kidding , that is a lot , speaks as lot about the gem"
14319,yes it was the best selling racing time of all time !
14320,"there were 10 huge switches in the same , i never noticed them though , not even one"
14321,i never did rather . i live near austin but i have never heard of the place which built a real life mario kart
14322,"that must be nice , i would like to take a picture there , i havent heard of that either , remember the coins and how they are you go faster"
14323,yes and more pet ; le thought they were random but htey were not at all

14422,yes . do you ever get into elvis ? the older i get the more i like him for some reason . ;
14423,i never cared too much for him . he failed music can . how was that possible .

14439,i vaguely remember hanson . the idea of a rock history class sounds really cool to me . a lesson including both elvis and bill monroe woudl be amazing !
14440,yes it would ! we can work elvis in to the rock talk . lol he was actually blonde and he dyed his hair black !
14441,i literally had no inhaling about that until now .
14442,i did't either . did you know that elvis ' daughter lisa was married to both michael jackson and nicholas cage ?
14443,"i knee she was married to jackson , but not tp cage . do you like the progressive rock era ?"
14444,i do ! ask me anything lol hte state rock song of oklahoma is ' do you realize ' by the flaming lips .
14445,i should google that just to see how bad it is . i think the provincial song of albert should be ' romeo song ' lol .
14446,lol you 're way up there then eh ? lol whitesnake has had over 0 members throughout its history . crazy !
14447,"nah , i ' ; m not actually in albert , i 'm in arkansas . i just think that 's a funny song lol . yeah , whitesnake sounds like it could be about ten whitesnake tribute bands ."
14448,lol elvis only ever field one class . . . ironically it was music !
14449,sometimes people who fail subject sin school wind up being the most creative people in those fields . are you n elvis fan ?
14450,i am a big fan ! i like his earlier stuff . kurt russell was the voice of elvis in forrest gump !
14451,yeah m i like his earlier stuf too back when he was a rockawbilly pioneer . he was just a glorified lounge singer in the 60s mo .
14452,"yes ! that was my favorite era of his ! love , love the rokcabilly stuff and he lost me as the lounge singer . lol freddie mercury of queen wrote ' crazy little thing called love ' as a tribute to elvis ."
14453,"i was in high school when that came ou t ; i remember sitting in , y friend ' muscle car in the morning before class drinking southern comfort while it player on the radio , lol ."
14454,nice ! i miss muscle cars . i wonder how many copies of elvis ' cds are at my local library ? i might have to go check that out . it 's been fun chatting !
14455,"my library has a good cd selection too . nice chatting with you as we , l !"
14456,have a great day !
14457,do you like elvis presley ?
14458,"yes , he wa sa little before my time , but i remember him in movie also ."
14459,"i know he is important , he wiener the musical interest of a lot of people . but i just do n't last to him"
14460,"me either , i think it 's cool that freddie mercury f the band queen , wrote these in , crazy little thing called love , i now minutes as a tribute to presley ."
14461,"i think rock music important historically , but is less relevant today . i do n't think van bandit initiative ego team kid bout american history through rock music will succeed ."
14462,"i agree with tht also , it 's funny to see the one class presley failed was his music class ? ."
14463,"it is funny , but a they same time , maybe it shows that that when elvis was a kid , musics as boring ."
14464,"true , i see that he was also a natural blonde , i thought it looked like he had dyed black hair ."
14465,"that is surprising , today no one who is naturally blonde woul dye his hair back ."
14466,"lisa marie presley , his daughter married both michael jackson and nicolas cage"
14467,i do n't she would have met them if her father was not as popular .
14468,"i agree , di do know there 's is more libraries than mcdonalds in the u . s . ?"
14469,"will , that is encouraging for thee country . i wonder if people use them for book , or other medias like dvds ."
14470,"i 'm curious about taht as well , i see that in sacramento ca , they have a ' library of thigns ' where you can check out sewing machines , an mother things like that , that 's a good idea as long as peopel return them ."
14471,"people are responsible , most of the time . i think it is a great idea , i do need to have tools all the time , only once or twice a year ."
14472,"true , over 50 percent of american have a library card still , that 's encouraging ."
14473,"yeah , do you go often to your library ."
14474,"i just look my mother alist week , to our local library , it 's a huge library that does a lot for the senior community also ."
14475,what kind o ibook do do read ? a prisoner studied law in a prison library to prove his innocence .

14477,"i like 18th century fiction , like dickens and bala ."
14478,hi how are u ? do you like star wars ?

14480,star wars was a sem8nal event ink y life . changed y view of film . loved it . didnt have money but to see it twice .
14481,"oh , i absolutely agree . did you know that george lucas ' back then wife had z major impact on the original star wars ?"
14482,"he was really , lucky to have met a partner with such a talent for story . she won an oscar to ."
14483,"incredible . i guess 20th century fox believed that star wars would be a flop , so !"
14484,"yeah , the execs have no imagination . it was an arrange film for the time , no one knew what was to come ."
14485,"it i a very strange film . all fantasy films are , though ."
14486,"it is fantasy , you 're right . not science fiction . space fantasy . lots of religion and mysticism ."
14487,"are you a fan of the fantasy films , by any chance ?"
14488,i did like the lotr series . i think i was hard to realize the books on the screen . many fans want it to follow the blows . that doesnt work .
14489,"apparently , 101 dalmatians i son the borderline of a fantasy film . surprising !"
14490,101 dogs all together ? i can imagine ! i have not seen that film in forever .
14491,me neither ! i guess jim henson also created some fantasy stuffy s well .
14492,"he did dark crystal , i think ? i dont remember . very creative guy ."
14493,"ye s , exactly ! he wanted to return the fantasy genre to its darker roots when he created it ."
14494,"yes , the dark cary part is important . the stories explore our fears in an unreal space . that is important for children . fear is part of life ."
14495,"oh , yes . i agree . do you watch game of thrones ? i feel like that could be considered a fantasy genre as well ."
14496,"yes , and his year is the last season 'd man i am looking forward to it . anyway , great chat !"
14497,"great chatting with you as well . if you have any suggestions for fantasy films , let me know ."
14498,have you seen the princess bride ? a comedy classic . have a great day !
14499,how as well .

14501,bye !
14502,fantasy films are one of my favorite genres o you1 ike them ?
14503,i ' not too into the mix o you like lord of the rings ? i thought it was good .
14504,i did it even won best picture it was so good
14505,yeah that is the first and only fantasy film to have done that
14506,i was surprised to see jim henson created a dark film called the dark crystal e always seemed so upbeat .
14507,yeah i guess he thought that it was unhealthy fo kids never t be scared . i noticed a little bit of darkness in a sesame street youtube clip my kids were watching today . hey asked work it to be used off . its wat and ernie in a pyramid .
14508,i have never seen that one . ave you ever been to a fan convention ? they can ne pretty crazy and lucrative for the stars
14509,no i have n't . how much can stars fake ?
14510,"so make more than 10 , 000 per weekend !"
14511,"wow , pretty cool . seems like it would be good to break up the routine as well ."
14512,yep . though the movies can be timeconsuming the thief and the cables that took 41 years to make !
14513,"was , how interesting . i wonder how tha works since technology must have advanced a lot in thos years"
14514,at least it was narrated and not made with real actors !
14515,"right , i had the same thought ! i still wondered though how they pieces together animation from different time s ."
14516,i am not sue . game of thrones is about to come on have you seen it ? its a great fantasy show
14517,i have seen it but it did n't hold my attention . arya is a pretty name . i guess it 's from game of thrones ?
14518,yes and its really popular as a baby name now !
14519,"yeh , i heard it 's the fastest rising new baby name !"
14520,ireland even finances the series beat emit boosts tourism
14521,how interesting ! have you watched game of lions ? maybe hat would interest me more because it is about the lives of lions .
14522,i have never heard of it . ; i know charlie chaplins granddaughter is in game of thrones
14523,"and harry lloyd is the great great creat grandson of charles dick , and !"
14524,hi do you like to watch fantasy films ?
14525,"i love fantasy films and book s , probably my favorite things to read or watch ."
14526,nice 21 i loved lord of the rings and currently love game of thrones .
14527,"yep i read all of lord of the rings after watching the movies , r and the song of ice series before game of thrones started on tv , wish germ would finish book so already , bt man the show is amazing ."
14528,yes it is ! harry lloyd who played viserys targaryen is the great great great grandson of charles dickens .
14529,have you seen
14530,hmmm . . . . . i 'm not sure what you were trying to ask
14531,"yea sorry about that , i accidentally hit enter i nthe middle of typing . i as asking if you had seen westworld , its really good to ."
14532,i hav even that . i like that on alot do ! i was just looking and i see there is another famous connection i ot . charlie chaplin 's granddaughter is in it . in even knew those fact .
14533,"the singer ed sheeran was in an episode of game of thrones was , he was with a group of guys sitting around q fire singing in season 7 ."
14534,i do remember reading that somewhere . there is a national geographic wild show called game of ; isn that follows the lives of lions just like the ot characters . lol
14535,"i have seen that show a few times it is actually pretty good , you would n't think a show just following lions would work but it is actually really interesting ."
14536,i 'm going to havent o watch it to se it . i 'm intrigued . got get financed by ireland because they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes .
14537,"i t one of the most expensive shows on television so that is pretty crazy that ireland pays for it , but then again it also makes a ton of money , people subscribes o hof o that shoe alien ."
14538,i work with people who can get enough of it . were you ever a star wars fan ?
14539,"i love the original 3 , the p ; prequels were not as bad as people but on , and the newer ones are kind of meh in my opinion , the force awakens was really good but the last jedi was terrible , mainly because i acted how they did luke skywalker death ."
14540,i would have to see i agree with you on all points . i wonder if luke really died thoug h ? be curious to see how they wrap up it all p in the last episode . the entire franchise had clone over 8 . 5 billion dollars at the box office !
14541,"oh yeah they make money hand over fist , but i have a feeling a lot of that is due to nostalgia from older generations two loved the originals ."
14542,yes . the entire franchise is valued at 6 billion if you include everything else besides just the movies .
14543,"was but it is sad that it is called so high yet the guy who did the voice of chewbaca , peter mayhew , made almost nothing for voicing th character end got none of the royalties from the originals either . he got pretty screwed in the long run ."
14544,i did't know that . yikes . i had fun chatting with you today ! hope the rest of you day is great !
14545,hey there what do you think about the star wars franchise ? i personally like the first three use do n't like the as of them
14546,"i love all of them . i love all og those super hero , scifi type of movies like solo and deadpool ."
14547,"yes i like the deadpool movie more than the new star wars movie personally . o think that lucas was a genius though . he gave up the of is direction free to get the licensing for hte first movie , and then became a billionaire after that"
14548,"wow , that 's incredible . guess it paid off for hi m ! unlock al pacino , who actually turned down the role for him solo . i guess his career still took off , but still ."
14549,yeah he still did fine haha . but i wonder how different star ward would have been if he were chosen instead . i also think it 's interesting that star wars has been dubbed into navajo . definitely not a major language but an interesting one nonetheless
14550,"thati 's definitely wool ! evidently christopher walked was considered for the role of a solo , a well !"
14551,"wow now that would be really different lol , do you know that george lucas 's wife at the time , marcia lucas , was actually responsible for a lot of thigns that made the original star war film good ? things like obiwan 's death and leia 's good luck iss . she also edited the trench run gov the depth star . i do n't think the movie would ave even that same without her , but you never hear about the"
14552,"tat 's crazy . at least the guy who played poe in the force awakens was able to shed light on guatemala , since he was from there . evidently , he insisted to be from yavin 4 because that 's where those schemes were filmed ."
14553,"yeah that 's nice that they were able to help him out by making his character be from that planet . it 's very strange o that george lucas wanted han solo to be either a large green alien or s black man , and then we ended up with harrison food lol"
14554,"and it 's funny thinking about the companionship he had with chewbacca later in life , if that had actualy been a large green alien . like baba the that ? ?"
14555,"haha that 's a good question . it 's also interesting that han solo was a tie lighter before hes started to fly the millennia falcon . we did n't get to see that in the original movie , but i have n't seen solo , so maybe that 's where it started ?"
14556,"yeah , you get to see a lot o his origin story in solo . he also worked as an imperial lieutenant ,"
14557,"yep that ? s the . did you want hat you liked deadpool by the way ? i like teh first movie more ryan the second , what about you ?"
14558,"i definitely liked the first one better . ryan reynolds is perfect for the par , which i suppose the creator deadpool thought , too . he as described as ' ryan reynolds crossed with a sharply . '"
14559,"haha that 's awesome ! i'n glad that they were able to get him to play th role because that 's so funny that it was int he comic like taht . i also think it 's interesting that the voice of the mystery villain is ryan reynolds too , in deadpool 2 , do you remember who the mystery voice was ?"
14560,"yeah , teh screenwriters said it was also ryan reynolds . it really is great . it 's the highest grossing rrated movie of all time !"
14561,"did you ever play the deadpool video game ? apparently it cost more than the movie itself . i played the lame and ia actually liked it a lot , just like the movie in terms of the humor and violence"
14562,"no , i did n't . i did n't even know there was one , to be honest ! i wonder if there will be a deadpool 3"
14563,i think ther well be . i know that they 're building up to it . so as long as they have a goo script they will probably do it . do you know who amazes cameron and david fischer are ? they 're both very famous directors and they helped to get the original deadpool movie made in the first place
14564,"yeah , theyve both friends with tim miller , who only directed the first one . he left early in during the deadpool 2 project due to creative differences ."
14565,"neat that 's interesting . i wonder how the second one would ahve been , if it would have been better or worse , with the original director . i do n't know why they got rid of him though . i would have liked to know th exact issue that they had"
14566,hi ! are you a star wars fan ?
14567,"hello there , yeah ia m , how about you ?"
14568,"i 'm impartial , but i admire the creator george lucas for his fondness and creativity to think outside the box and create a successful empire ."
14569,"yeah i agree , he created a whole following that is pretty intense these days !"
14570,yeah and to htjnkt hat film studios back then were convinced that the movie was going to flop whereby agreeing to a deal to forgo 500k in directing fees so that he can keep licensing and merchandising rights forth himself . genius !
14571,"yeah what a goo dove , who woudl have thought how much the franchise would be worth today ."
14572,"teh do offer the film i numerous languages worldwide but only recently di they duh ? in navajo fdr native american 's , i would think that they understood english ?"
14573,"yeah same here , but that is a , fly cool stat theyd woudl do that . do you know how long it took james earl jones to record data vaders lines or the first film ?"
14574,"no i 'm not sur how long , but if i had to take a gues i would say one year ? am i close ?"
14575,"no , i guess it was only two and a half hours ! he got paid 7500 , but that was good money for under three hours of work !"
14576,"oh my goodness q that is a great paycheck while others are making minimum wage . he probably also got payment as a result of license and merchandise elias too probably , except no one knows who they actor is or that he was in the film"
14577,"yeah right , good money for the time as well . did you know al pacino turned down the role of han solo ?"
14578,"i wonder if al pacino regrets that decision . to not be casted after auditioning 9s one story , but to turn down an offer that ' insane ! i think i 'm more of a deadpool fan than star wars ."
14579,"yes i bet , did you see the newest deadpool movie that came out ?"
14580,of course ! i really enjoy his sarcastic sesame o humor but otehr do n't get it . the video game actually cost more money to make than the movie . i do n't play video games but that 's insane !
14581,"wow , that i incredible ! an yeah i like how a superhero move can be rated r and be fun !"
14582,"seriously ! i think ryan reynolds did a great job , he 's also the time of the mystery villain !"
14583,i never knew that ! yeah he is a grea actor and i think he is a realy good person in real like as well .
14584,i agree ! hd 's hilarious in real life because i enjoy his interviews on talk shows . they did a great job of casting all the marvel characters
14585,"yeah they really did , i think most of all of the people they got are perfect for their roles ."
14586,"i agree ! even the directors ! james cameron and david fischer actually convinced deadpool , 's director to direct the film , i wonder why they did n't do it themselves ."
14587,"yeah that is a good question . well it was nice taking with you try , i hope you have a good day ."
14588,"hi , how are you ?"
14589,"hello there , i am well thank you . are you a fan of star wars ?"
14590,i am . i love star wars but i am not a nut that knows all or the characters .
14591,"yeah there are some true star wars nuts out there , i now the movies as well but not that nuts . what is your favorite of the film s ?"
14592,"i like star wars . the second one , according o the release date . you ?"
14593,"yeah same here , the empire strikes back wa the best of the bush . they ca n't replicate that again ."
14594,no . i thought jar jar bind kills the next series of 3 . now i am worried they will be overexposed with all the movies and that will kill them .
14595,"yeah he was really bad , i did n't like when htey redid the music scene in return of the jedi s well ."
14596,yeah . . . do you like then ew one that came out ? i thought solo was average . i expected more out of them . . .
14597,"i have n't seen the solo one or hte last jedi , hate i really not to , i just shave been so busy and did n't make it to the theaters ."
14598,both of now out on netflix it i watched solo in two parts . have n't seen the last jedi . i am ike you and too busy for theaters . . .
14599,"yeah i liked hte look offs olaf ron mothe previews , but i want to see bot equally i would ay ."
14600,solo was ok . i have a hard time laughing the quality of it since it got bad reviews . i thought it was ok but packed some emit .
14601,yeah and plus if you are a fan of the original ones before the 90 's then all of them are hard to say they are good .
14602,"maybe chef 's the issue . . . i sam comparing them to the original , which are almost perfect ."
14603,"yeah that is how i feel i am too , because they are that good where it is just impossible to replicate ."
14604,i am surprised that star wars was the first movie into be dubbed in navajo and was the first major firm to be dubbed in native american . seems like it should have been one enforce 2013
14605,"yes i am the same way , it took way too long , but i guess later is better than never ."
14606,"yeah . if you 're al pacino , do you regret turning down the role of al pacino ?"
14607,"right , think about how iconic that role has become i but when i think about it , pacino has no problems with that ."
14608,true . nice chatting with you !
14609,"hi , do you watch star wars ?"
14610,"i jv watching star wars , but i have n't had a chance , see the new han solo movie yet . i heard it was a nice addition to th saga"
14611,yeah it was for sure . do you know who oscar isaac is ?
14612,is he a character rain teh movie ? i do n't remember that name
14613,yeah thye played th enroll of poe dameron and requested that the character be a native of yavin 4
14614,"interesting . without star wars , the director games cameron would hasve never quit his job as a truck driver"
14615,good for him . yeah that was because he is originally from guatemala and that is where the scenes were filmed
14616,that makes sense . the whole saga as we know it is actualy told by r2d2 centuries after it all occurs
14617,yeah . james earl jones was only paid 7000 forth i spreading of lines for 2 . 5 hours
14618,he must have really believed in the project . can you imagine if bill murray ha gotten the role of han solo instead ? it would feel like a completely different character
14619,for sure . george lucas ' wife won also very involve dnc hte scripts for the movie
14620,"that 's awesome ! not must have taken them a while . in the original , han solo was supposed to be secretly amrri3d to a movie . i 'm sure someone has writting fan fiction about that"
14621,yeah i bet too . yeah his wife mode some awesome changes and actually won the academy awards for it
14622,maybe the 's the one responsible fort he han solo and leia romance . the movie now hold the record for the most successful merchandising franchise
14623,yes she is i think . and it is the first major movie dubbed in navajo
14624,"in the mix of its accomplishments , it 's the second highest grossing film series of all time"
14625,that is amazing . did you ever watch deadpool ?
14626,"no , i didn ' ? t . he 's one character of th eamrvcel comics whom i do n't have such interest in . which is confusing since the rights are owned by fox"
14627,i see . apparently deadpool describes himself as bryan reynolds crossed with a sharply '
14628,that 's an interesting mix of characters . it took ryan reynolds 11 years to get the movie made
14629,"yeah , he believed he was destined for the role . nice chat"
14630,hello . have you seen the panda researchers ? they are so cute in their panama costumes .
14631,"i have not seen them , i probably assumed that the were pandas too . they must have bee realistic ."
14632,"they are adorable , and always make me smile . same with johnny depp , traveling with his jack sparrow costume , so he can visit i kids ,"
14633,"i 'm not sure how i 'd feel about an impromptu visit from a pirate eli fi were in hospital , at least it 's not willy wonka , he was kind of creepy ."
14634,"taht , ne was . i like him in the captain jack role , so if would be thrilled to see how ."
14635,"so he has that costume around wherever he goes , i wonder i fan as a makeup artist in tow to do his face too ."
14636,"he 's been in hollywood long enough to know how to put on eyeliner , lol ."
14637,"i understand rt , literature , music and painting were in hte olympics , i wonder if makeup artistry was ever in it too"
14638,"i do n't know . winston churchill on a nobel prize for literature , he could have been in the olympics ."
14639,"i 'm surprised he had times for everything , i know he painted too wh e could hav been a multi gold winner like michael phelps ."
14640,"he also read a book a day . do you know when it was , the fda burned six tons of literature e ?"
14641,"i would hazard a guess in the fifties , but i just a guess . there are always moral panics about whatever the kids are into these days . i wonde flow many books six tons represents ."
14642,"that 's a good question . it 's fasciantingf that romantic kissing is rarely mentioned in ancient greek literature , they invented debauchery ."
14643,"see , not everything was better in the old days . the debauchry probably came from wearing those togas ."
14644,"those would eb better than the costumes they wore in game with the wind , or even the costume her cousin , dnc holiday , wore in the ol doest ."
14645,"good or bad costumes , the movie was a smash , i believe when inflation adjusted it is still the biggest movie of all time ."
14646,"it 's interesting her parents did n't tell her the south lost , until she was ten . '"
14647,"it was probably sa more sheltered time , plus not the kind of thing you bring up othe if you live i nthe south ."
14648,i would have loved to hav been at hot festival when gone with the wind was released .
14649,"perfect the to get dressed up in authentic costume , or have leo tall whip something up for you ."
14650,"thank to for chatting with me , i have to bet the kids ready for bed . have a wonderful night ."
14651,do you like literature ?
14652,i love it . did you know the fda once burned tons of books ?
14653,"yes that was during censorship and it was 6 tons , crazy"
14654,yea . there is wa contest every year for the novel with the worst opening sentence
14655,yeah must be a fun one . i doyou know churchill won a nobel prize in literature ?
14656,"yes that was back in 1953 , pretty talented guy"
14657,i know right ? literature was also part of the olympic games
14658,"yeah until 250 along with music , painting and sculpture"
14659,yeah . did you know romantic kissing is hard to find in ancient literature ?
14660,yes it is quite the new development in literature
14661,yes that is . you can not find it in the works in ancient greek .
14662,yeah . did you know panda researchers wear panda costumes ?
14663,yes pretty cool . . did you know stan bean is scared of flying and once hiked a mountain in costume for recordings

14674,i do know who he is ? . do you know who h eis ?
14675,"yes i do . . . interesting , there would be a documentary about his fashion !"
14676,i know . seems really acute for a documentary . . .
14677,i love how allen says it is a moral code to dress well . . . something this generation sould take into consideration !
14678,"yeah . is supervise young staff and cannon believe what i see them wear , m are like what i do not see them wear ."
14679,"lol . . . yeah , that 's for sure . . . really just comes iowan to one thing . . . respect ! i 'you wear disrespectful clothes , then you show no respect for the people around you . especially in a work environment !"
14680,yeah ! the fda would burn their clothes like 6 tons of literature !
14681,lol . . . for sure ! i wonder why the fda would have anything to do with literature though ?
14682,i am not sure . churchill won a nobel prize in literature !
14683,i can see that . . . who was a brilliant man ! that 's funny how romantic kissing in literature is a modern development .
14684,it 's lime my life . . . was n't there until recently . . . did you know literature was a olympic event from 19121952 ? s seems so different !
14685,"yeah i saw that , imagine watching someone designing a building on abc ? lol"
14686,ha ! ' such great lines ' impecibly built ! post moderism at it 's finest . . . i cna hear the spooky !
14687,"hahahaa ! , ! yeah . . . been compensated by joe buck !"
14688,you could not pick a better commentator . nicely done !
14689,why thank ya ! you should become a panda researcher to you get to were a panda costume to word ! l ol
14690,i should have thought about that . that would make wearing 'the costume a lot less awkward than dig wise it now .
14691,that 's awesome how johnny depp makes surprise visits to sick kids in hospitals !
14692,yeah . nice of him . nice chatting with yiu !
14693,"hey there , do you like literature ?"
14694,"i love to read , so yeah . that is why it makes e am when i did out that the fda burned 6 tons of literature in order to censor ."
14695,i know so sad . there is a competition where the person tthat writes the worst opening sentence for a novel wins
14696,"i uae reward about that . did you know that sir winston churchill won a nobel prize in lit , not peace e !"
14697,"the fun was so smart , g ot his hands on everything really ."
14698,it now ! amazing . have you ever dead gone with the wind ? it is great .
14699,"yes il moved that book , read it in university . literature was even an olympic event ."
14700,it was written by margarita mitchell . i love books tat are abused ou of the south . scarlett is one of my all time favorite characters .
14701,seen could have won the olympic medal for that work of literature . did you know kissing was not even mentioned in ancient greek literature ?
14702,no way ! i ca n't believe ho many tickets have been sold for the movie . supposedly it sold 220 million an 'the population at that time was only 15 million .
14703,"that really does not make sense , strange , maybe people who were evisitigb bought tickets too"
14704,or people saw the movie numerous times . if you adjust for inflation nit would be the highest grossing film of all time .
14705,yeah that makes sense . the mayor of atlanta even declared a bday festival when the movie was released
14706,"that is co , you know that it is the second favorite book of american readers , behind the bible ! taht is crazy to think about that ."
14707,"i know , that a reach . did yo know that panda researchers wear panda costumes ?"
14708,what ? well johnny depp brings his balck sparrow costume with him went he travel in has way he can visit sick kids in the hospital and surprise them .
14709,that is so nice since ego many kids lilke that character . i heard eh does this because once his daughter was really sick adn the hospital managed to save her .
14710,wow . i did n't know that . i love costumes from movies . the hoggle costume from labyrinth was lost in shipping and now is at the unclaimed baggage museum in alabama . seems like they would have just returned it .
14711,you would think so . i guess ore people get to see it since it is in a museum now .
14712,that 's true . i think it is funny that they used to call a swim suit a swimming costume ! so weird .
14713,"i know , how things have changed . it was nice chatting with you"
14714,"yes there , do you watch tennis ?"
14715,"yes , i like tennis especially when serena williams is playing ."
14716,did you kno wthe a tennis player was how polo shirts came about ?
14717,"no , i did n't know , i was thinking it was because of the polo players ."
14718,apparently it was because of one lacoste
14719,"oh , no black man won the tennis title since 1968 ?"
14720,that is strange . apprently in the us open 1969 it rained so much they used a helicopter to dry it
14721,"yes it is , i wonder just how they went about drying a field with a helicopter ?"
14722,it must have been the propeller doing so fast taht removed the water drops
14723,"yes , can you imaging aw tennis match last 11 hours spread over 3 days ? that 's almost 4 hours a day ."
14724,the players must have been exhausted by hte end of it
14725,do you remember billie jean king ? she was also a good tennis player .
14726,no i do not . do you watch and the games that serena plays ?
14727,"yes almost all her gues , i like her sister also , but i like serena has a little more arm strength than she does ;"
14728,and they are both so smart and speak fluent french and italian
14729,"taht i is n't know , i did n't know they both speak 3 languages ."
14730,hands serena i seven a coowner of miami dolphins
14731,"yes , i was surprised to hear that , i thought her mind would be closely focuses on tennis ."
14732,"yeah , she is a over the place . she won the 23rd grand slam awhile pregnant"
14733,i was also surprised she payed while being pregnant . i am proud she did n't let anything stop her .
14734,i know and that baby was born a champion . it was nice chatting with you
14735,did you know that teh highest point on the moon is 1939 meters higher than count everest ?
14736,"no , i always think of it as f , at and craters filled . its the fifth largest natural satellite in the solar system ."
14737,"i did n't know it . i did know that on titan , which is a moon of saturn , there is some evidence of methane based life ."
14738,"that 's fascinating , imagine if they finally find definite proof of life somewhere ."
14739,that would eb cool . by the way are you a movie fan ?
14740,"i am . i always like leonardo dicaprio , it n't realize he was so old , born k 1974 ."
14741,"just a few years older than me . tom hanks is the highest al , time boxoffice star ! !"
14742,"but a little over than met i , bt i ' l , pretend he 's such older bt om hank his certainly made some memorable films , but to be the highest box office earner is cray ."
14743,"i know , he has done hrs . 5 billion in worldwide film earnings ."
14744,"that 's ca n't even imagine moeny , i do n't think of the silence of the lambs as a date movie but it premiered on valentine 's day in 1991 ."
14745,"i do n't think of it as a dat movie either . disney is killing it now the it 's marvel movies , etc . but a whole hack , treasure planet was one of the most expensive flops of all time ."
14746,disney actually considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a bo office failure . i ca n't imagine my childhood without disney animated movies .
14747,"i ca n't either . hey , you mentioned leonardo dicaprio earlier . did you know growing paints helped launch hi scarse r ?"
14748,"i did , growing paints helped a few actor sin their career , namely bran pitt nd matthew perry ."
14749,i knew that as well . dicaprio i producing a new twilight zion movie .
14750,"i 'm interested to see where that goes . i wonder if hell win ny awards for it , sad he 's only won a golden globe ."
14751,"that is crazy , i figured he had many awards ."
14752,"h redid have maroon brands oscar , but he ad to turn it over to the us government ."
14753,i wonder why that was ? i know he starred in ' the reenact ' but i never saw it .
14754,"me either , it 's a remake of the 1971 fil m , man in the wilderness , never saw that either !"
14755,"well , thanks for the chat ."
14756,good morning ! do you watch tennis ? i recently learned that the longest tennis match in history lasted or three days .
14757,"i dont usually watch it , no . i o like playing though . its too hard to follow for me"
14758,"i agree that it can be hard to follow . it reminds me of another game that is hard to follow . say , did you know that polos shirts were actually invented by a tennis player for tennis ?"
14759,"really ? thats fun . im a fan of polo shirts but i would have assumed they were invented for , well , polo !"
14760,"me too . it just makes sense . they were invented by a laser , rene lacoste , for tennis . over time they were adopted by polo players ."
14761,hey i know lacoste ! te alligator shirts !
14762,"right ! those shirt became really popular for everybody and still are . speaking of popular , have you heard of serena williams ? she 's one of the top ranked female tennis players ."
14763,"yea i do wher ! ses younger than i thought . , . born in 1981 . shes a superstar . she co owns theyd miami dolphins too !"
14764,"does she really ? i guess i just thought of her as a tennis player . it 's cool to know that she owns a business , especially a football team ."
14765,if eels likes o many sports stars start to go into business once thy have wayyyyy to much money
14766,i know that you mean . serena aks surprising though . she 's not only great at tennis but speaks french nd italian .
14767,so is her sister ! i wonder why
14768,i do n't know but it is impressive . maybe she is an overachiever . seth wo a grand slam tournament while she was pregnant after all .
14769,i 'm shocked they let her play !
14770,i was surprised too . i would have thought it would bed dangerous for the baby but she played and did n't drop a single set .
14771,apparently in 2007 she was ranked 95th in the world . is that high ? im not really sure . i wouldve expected it to be higher i guess
14772,i do n't know . with everything reported about her it does seem to . she 's a very confident woman though . she said she could beat any man ranked 200 or worse in tennis and a man took up the challenge and beat he r .
14773,thats awkward haha her hubris go th best of her . that situation i guess
14774,i gues is . she has reached a ranking of number one before so maybe that gave her the encouragement .
14775,i hope so because she really is one of the greats . shes even beaten maria sharapova
14776,i think the only women ranked above her i some ranking is stefani graf and martina navratilova .
14777,how 's it going ? did you know polo shirts were originally invented for a denis player ?
14778,"noway , relaly ? that is cool . i really like to watch serena williams . she is so talented and unstoppable ."
14779,"yea , serena williams has been ranked number 1 eight times by the way"
14780,"is that right , wow 2 she is superwoman . i recently heard that the is part co owner roof the minaj dolphins ! i had no idea ."
14781,"yea williams is a pretty good player , she kept one of her no . 1 rankings ifr 186 weeks straight"
14782,"wow , good for her ! i know hat some people consider grunting before a shot to be cheating but i do n't know about that ? i guess some people think its a form of cheating more or less ."
14783,"it does sound annoying , but not as annoying as a helicopter bing use to dry the grass on a tennis court like in the 1969 us open"
14784,"yeah , it does sound gross , i agree , i get used to it after a while . serena went to when she was only 13 years old . another amazing fun fact ."
14785,i wonde what her longest match was and if it game close the the longest match in tennis history at 11 hours
14786,"wow , t hat 's a marathon ! ! what type heck . i heard that the longest rally was 643 shots , i think ."
14787,that 's pretty crazy . the first us open was won in 1968 by the only black man to ever win the open
14788,"wow , again . that is something geese . 1968 was a long time ago . hte longest reall went 29 mins too , i think ."
14789,tennis player gael monfils beat one of the best paddle tennis payers days after learning just howto o play
14790,"gosh , i wish i could play any sport . i heard ping pong was n't even called fin pong ut i am not very good t that one always . i guess its called able tennis officially . it is fun to play sometimes though ."
14791,yea if your ok at it . did you know serena williams won her 23rd grenades was when she was 2 months pregnant ?
14792,"noway , i am hugging something at 2 months and it was n't a wicket . that is crazy ! it reminds me of a katy perry song ."
14793,which honey ? not one of her debut songs on the album katy hudson ?
14794,"it was he hear me roar song , its lure which album though ."
14795,its crazy russel bran ended his marriage with perry over a text message
14796,"gosh h , yeh that eas cold hearted ! he was a weirdo though . ya know katy was a christian singer to begin with and then moved to the pop music with her first official album . she also tied michael jackson noce ."
14797,"well i have to go , nice chatting with yo"
14798,"hi , how are you ? d o you know much about tennis ?"
14799,"yes i love tennis . i used to play it a lo the i was a kid , what about you ?"
14800,i never really played the sport . maybe a couple of times . it always seemed complicated . especially the score .
14801,"sew the scoring is kin of weir for sure . also weird is that until 1978 you could use any object as a racket , not just a tennis racket"
14802,"how often did people show up with something different ? that would be strange . i heard that htey used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for hte 1969 did open . that 's probably how i would have handled it , too . lol"
14803,"haha it 's a good idea though ! just think what else could they have done ? what 's weird is that tennis is not very popular , soccer is the most popular sport because it makes more money than all other sports combined"
14804,soccer is easy for anyone to play . just a ball and as flat area . not really any social equipment .
14805,"yes that 's a good point . i do think , thinking back to tennis though , that in longest point was a rally that lasted 29 minutes , t a 's so exhausting !"
14806,i ca n't imagine . they must have collapsed l the an must have collapsed too .
14807,"yep it was made of z 643 shot rally back add forth , that would definitely tire anyone out , also do you think that when a player runs while theyre palying that that is z form of cheating ?"
14808,"i do n't . it probably sounded vulgar and classes to the likes that play and watch the game , but some people make noise . it kind grunting shows intensity ."
14809,"yep i agree , sometimes a 's just a natural could that you can stood . what do you think about serena williams by the way ?"
14810,"i think she has worked hard for her succes . i heard that she said she would not retire when she was more of tennis , but when she was tired of practicing ."
14811,it 's impressive that the was born in 1981 . that makes her four years older than em but incredibly much better at tennis lol
14812,"i think that she has bee involved since she was young . it takes a lifetime to get to her level . i guess she could use her kids tomb e players , or become w coach ."
14813,she seems very successful though . i never realized that she was a coowner of th dolphins
14814,"yes , she plowed that cash into a great investment that will grow forever ."
14815,"yep i agree with you . i also did n't know she does a character voice in the cartoon avatar , she is very talented"
14816,"what ? that is a strange fact . i guess she had a chance to do the voice work ? she is a celebrity , after all ."
14817,"did you ever play tennis ? serena as been playing since she was 13 , which is about when i started playing , bt she 's obviously way better lol"
14818,"i assumed that she started sooner . she must have picked it up quick . i did n't real play . anyway , great chat ! thanks !"
14819,"yep thank you too , keep in mind serena williams is the first player ever , male or female e , to ahciefe the career golden slam which is incredible"
14820,"hey , ow are you ? did you know that moon dust was harmful to humans ? i had no idea ."
14821,"me neither , i remember how they were so careful about stuff that came back from the moon thought it was all benign ."
14822,i wonder if it 's just the our moon 's dust or if it 's all moon 's dust that biz harmful .
14823,it seems like they are all so different . like titan may have methane based life . i guess he 'll just hav it go see .
14824,something to look forward to right ? have you been to any good movies lately ? do you try and see ones thati re box office hits or do you choose a movie for other reasons ?
14825,"i rarely go to , or even watch any movies . i 'm too fidgety and anyway they 're not very good . like titanic as supposed to be so great but i never could bring myself to line dicaprio ."
14826,"oh wow . i love movies . but i can see why you would n't . i 'm not a fan of dicaprio either . i wanted to like him after seeing what 's eating gilbert grasp , but with each show after i liked him less and less ."
14827,"maybe i should hasve look at gilbert grape , taht was his first big role i guess . got him an oscar nomination , never won one for real though . surprising for the amount of box office he 's generated ."
14828,i do n't follow the awards very close . i find i usually do n't like the movies that are hits with hte critics or generate huge box office revenue . i 'm never heartbroken over who does n't win for . o do love tom hanks though . in my eyes he is a that actor . i do n't think i 've seen a movie of his i did't like if not love .
14829,"yeah , hanks has a way of pulling off so many different roles . 8 . 5 billion in total box office . and he 's worth it . amazing range of roles ."
14830,i wall always got o a movie he 's in bo matter what it 's about . watching him in apollo 11 is what got me more interested in space that anything else . up until then i had no idea the moon had mountains and valleys like the earth . even high than mt . everest !
14831,"that mountain is really shocking , considering how small and dense the moo n't . did you know that nasa actually considered putting a united nations flag on the moon instead of u . s . that would have shook up things !"
14832,"oh wow ! can you imagine ? it 's such a source of pride here in the us . , i 'm glad it went te way it did . did you know our moon is the 5th largest satellite in the solar system ?"
14833,"dunno about that . but consider this , if dicaprio played the astronaut or apollo 11 then w could have a new record for box office flop . that would have been huge !"
14834,"so true ! and no awards for that show since he seems to have a weird ability to not win any , deserved or not . maybe working with brad pitt on growing paints kind him . brad ca n't seem to . anything wrong ."
14835,"look what happened to matthew perry , i 'm wonder if he regrets sticking with tv ? lots of work putting a show out very week and not as much money although i 'm sure it 's plenty ."
14836,"that 's true too . i know matthew perry made atl east he movie , i see it on tv once in a while but do n't think i 've ever watched start to finish so i 'm not sure if it 's good or not . i ' dave to check them box office numbers to see if it was considered a success or not ."
14837,"we did n't mention the reenact . my montana brother who 's into that era history thought it wa accurate . nd dicaprio really earned his money in taht one getting beat up all the time . or his double did ,"
14838,"well , maybe there is hope for dicaprio after al . i 've heard some led things about that movie . it 's been fun chatting with you . i 'm in the mood to pop some popcorn and watch a tom hanks flick !"
14839,"good idea . maybe you have encouraged me to see one if . even if it is af or , that can be sa source of pride too . after all sleeping beauty was a box office flop too ."
14840,well if you do i hope you enjoy it ! ! did 's only a flop if you o n't like it a i love most stings disney . treasure plant however was a box off flop what deserved that title for lure !
14841,"enjoy what 's in front o for , not a bad idea ."
14842,i always thought that there was only one type pf hockey ice hockey .
14843,what other kinds of hockey are there ? are hey in the olympics ?
14844,the other type is fields hockey . i do not think it is in the olympics ?
14845,fields hockey ? ' i wonder why anyone would play that instead of soccer .
14846,i do n't know but canada has ice hockey as own of their national sports .
14847,what 's the other national sport ? i thought canadians talked an dreamed only about hockey .
14848,the other one is lacrosse .
14849,"accross is a grass sport , so i guess they play that in the summer . i do n't know how well canadian do internationally in lacrosse , but they sure do well internationally . they have a real rivalry with the us ."
14850,the us is just started to be competitive in ice hockey . a hockey player was traded for 1 in 1993 o you now if it was a canadian or american player ?
14851,like do n't know . i would suspect that the canadian would not go to the us for only 1 .
14852,you are right . somehow i thought it was 1m and i was just a typo .
14853,i ' v heard that hockey players can lose tons of weight in just one game . serious execution here .
14854,up to 8 pounds ! that was what i heard .
14855,i suppose that 's mostly water . they can regain fluid pretty fast .
14856,and it applies to professional hockey players mostly since they take hocky very seriously .
14857,i always wondered how sports stadiums switched between basketball and hockey . hte rink s right under the court !
14858,i do n't know how it works . i wish i knew the explanation .
14859,i think they resemble the floor in pieces over top the rink .
14860,i 'll bet canada ahah dedicated ice hockey rings since the sport is their pride wand joy . perhaps basketball o hockey stadium are only in the us . i do n't know .
14861,"the only place that could have both is toronto . the raptors share a space with the left , i believe , right in downtown toronto ."
14862,it is good to know . i 've got to run now . it was really nice chatting with you .
14863,afternoon ! a fan of hockey ?
14864,i do like choice ! wat about you ?
14865,i 've been a bigger fan in the was . i was a caps fan growing up .
14866,i am a cap can too ! do you know how much a player loses weight per gram e ?
14867,like 8 pounds . i assume that 's mostly sweat .
14868,yes ! i can not believe they drop that much weigh !
14869,there was a hockey player traded fo a in 1993 .
14870,i heard he went on to win 4 stanely cups !
14871,god for him . sticking it to the man !
14872,have you seen the movie frozen ?
14873,i have listened to it probably 15 time as my kids have patched it on long road trips . but i 've never actually ' does ' it . you ;
14874,"yes , i love that movie !"
14875,it sound like a great movie . ' let it go ' sure sticks in your head .
14876,"did you know that before let it go as written , elsa was the main villian ?"
14877,relaly ? i suppose that would humanlike her .
14878,the song was so uplifting her character was changed instead of the sun .
14879,the guy who cowrote that song also prom us for the scrubs musical . i loved that episode .
14880,"the person won an emmy , a grammy , an oscar , and a ton !"
14881,4 few ! jennifer lee the director of frozen was the first female director for a disney animated film . good on her for dong such a great job .
14882,i agree ! i hope shed irectsm ore movies .
14883,nice chatting !
14884,do you enjoy hockey ?
14885,"i actually really enjoy it , nad i 've been playing my whole life , both ice , and ball hockey . how about you ?"
14886,"oh , wow . i like to watch but could never play . i was stunned when i recently learned that an ice hockey rink just remain under a basketball court when they switch hit ."
14887,"yeah , its ? ' insane how fast they do the conversion too . in less than 24 hours , they are able to completely transform the whole arena , from basketball floor , to be a it 's funny , back in the day , hockey rinks only use it gave oven penalty box for but teams , so you 'd have players from opposing teams , fight with each other in the boxes 2"
14888,oh wow ! that is impressive . i dis n't know they put them in the same box either . that 's a recipe for disaster . did you know tha canada has two nationals sports ?
14889,"interesting . you 'd think that canada 's national sport would only be hocky , but i guess there 's another sport , just as popular . hockey is an interesting sport . you usually think of hockey games as being low scoring , but the s , ovzkian women 's hockey team , once heat bulgaria 820 , it ws ridiculous ."
14890,i cant ' imagine a hockey game scoring tha thigh . i 'm surprised when a team scores 5 or over . i ca n't see how it 's possible to score 82 .
14891,"it wa sa crazy game , they average 1 goal every 44 seconds . they would basically win the takeoff , and center ice , and skate down , and score , every play ."
14892,wow ! i wonder what in hte world he goalie was doing . did you know that the average professional hockey players loses up to 8 pounds in one hockey game ? !
14893,"seriously ? ! i had no idea . no wonder they have been know unto bulk up with pasta ' and heavy meals before games , because they know that they 'd lose that weigh anyway , haha"
14894,i would think you would have to load up or you 'd pass out . do you enjoy wrestling at all ? traditional or the flashy soap kind ?
14895,"i used to watch wrestling a lot as a id , but nowadays , the story lines have just become ridiculous , and unwatchable to me . one of my favorite wrestlers was macho man , if you know he was actually highend to play with the t . louis cardinals , before he started wrestling ? that guy was talented ."
14896,oh i remember macho fame . no i di no know that . it 's very interesting . were hyou aware that the lincoln is in the wrestling hall f fame ?
14897,"i did know that he was a wrestler , but didnt know that he was in the hall of fame , that 's awesome ."
14898,he was very accomplished . one only lost once in around 300 matches . very impressive .
14899,"wow , in that 's world , that would , that would probably make him one o 'the top athletes . neil degrasse tyson was actually undefeated in his high school wrestling career , and even wrestled gore harvard , but i have no idea how many matches chef ought in"
14900,"i did not know that about tyson . he 's a i man but i did n't peg him ws an athlete . before becoming a philosopher , plato was lso a professional wrestler ."
14901,"see , that make sense to me , because plato was greek , and greek wrestling was hugely popular , and still is ."
14902,"it makes sense to me as well . since you mentioned macho man earlier , did you know that his outfits were designed by the same person who designed clothing for jimi hendrix and aerosmith ?"
14903,"you know , i did not know that , but now hat i think of it , that would completely make sense . those guys had a great fashion sense , and macho mona definitely looked similar tot hem ."
14904,yes they all wb very flashy outfits .
14905,"hi , how are you tonight ?"
14906,"good , what do you think about womens hockey ?"
14907,i do n't know much about hockey . i suppose the women 's team eas its appeal .
14908,"same , did you know they play in the olympics ?"
14909,yes . i expect women 's hockey to be just as serious and competitive as them en 's .
14910,"maybe , the canadian womens beat the usa five straight games"
14911,a lot of canadians begin skating very young .
14912,tru e ! did u know the ice hockey ring remains under the basketball court when they switch sports ?
14913,i guess they have to be best use of the space . th sport is intense . payers can vote up to 8 pounds in one game .
14914,"hum , maybe i should play ha"
14915,tough way to lose weight ! wrestling might be a more un way .
14916,"yes , and who knew abe lincoln is in the wrestling hall o fame"
14917,"abe ws the man ! he was like , 65 , tall , but really goods t wrestling . i dont win he ever tried oil wrestling ."
14918,"funny image , plato was a wrestler too"
14919,probably the origins of grecoroman wrestling go back to that time . a good way tos days it . i wonder whether women wrestled ten .
14920,"i would think probably not , b ut not sure"
14921,women in different parts of greece took different roles . perhaps t varied across the area . plus there was lots of olive oil around .
14922,"ha yes , how about those outfits , the man that designed macho mans also did clothes or aerosmith"
14923,"flamboyant outfits ! well , ive ad a groovy me chatting with you !"
14924,"same : ,"
14925,bye
14926,do you like the avengers movies ?
14927,yes i do . the infinity war is the first one to be filmed with imax cameras
14928,yeah . do you know who is the waitress that is saved by captain america ?
14929,yes that was the same person that voice gretchen in recess
14930,yeah . do you know who played teh hulk in the 90s ?
14931,yes tht was lou ferrigno and he still doe the voice of hulk
14932,"yeah wb ease of the movie , the shawarma sales real ; . went up"
14933,cool . the guy who voiced jarvis has never seen the movie
14934,wow cool . do you know when the infinity war came out ?
14935,yes the was in 2018 and it was released in 3d as well
14936,"yeah those are awesome . on another topic , do you like brady ?"
14937,i sure do . did you know his wife makes double what he makes ?
14938,yes she is super i too . sad is always in the injury report
14939,yes the coach seems go like to list him ish the weekly report
14940,yeah . he has never eaten a strawberry in his life
14941,i wonder if he is allergic or just not a fan of them
14942,"ish ave no idea . it his current team , he has either won or lost the super bowl by 3 or 4 pointe"
14943,cool ? . do you know who john mccain is ?
14944,yes the arizona senator . he was really againt am lke a to be a national holiday
14945,wow that is sad . his mom i still alive and she even too racecar driving lessons not too long ago
14946,wow go woman . i chat
14947,"hello ! do you watch football ? that do you think of tom brady , the patriot 's quarterback ?"
14948,hi . i rarely watch football . i think brady is good looking and clearly her good at what he does . a lot omg people seem to ate him though . i think i saw what he word to the met bala
14949,i did n't hear about that or see anything of it ? what did he get ?
14950,it was just a fun with golden mbroidery like the article a . if i remember the time was somethings about the ones o catholic church so some people went all out
14951,oh i see . well i know his wife is a super model . i hear she makes more than twice he does a year .
14952,"i did n't know that , but good for her . their kids ahve probable ; y hit the genetic jackpot . why would they list him every week on the injury report even he 's not hurt ?"
14953,i bet they do that to mess with the other team . you know what i think is odd about brady ? eh has never eaten a strawberry before !
14954,which is a really weird thing for anyone to kknow . unless youre allergic i do n't know how you get to your 30s without eating a strawberry .
14955,"i know , it 's so bizarre . i 've heard he and his wife , gisele bundchen , are on special diets . strawberries are a fruit so why not eat them ?"
14956,"or , maybe its some kind of sports superstition thing . i dod n't know he was n't picked until the 6th round . pretty good deal for the patriots back then i 'm sure"
14957,it did turn out to be a good deal for then . since he was picked in the 6th round do you know if they intended hi jlo be their starter or i they had another quarterback that he replaced at some point ?
14958,how about the avengers ? are you a superhero movie person ?
14959,i like some of them . i have n't seen infinity war yet . i think that 's the one with guardians of the galaxy in it . have you seen it ?
14960,"i get teh movies mixed up , but i did see the one with the guardians ? . tey 're ok for light entertainment . ts kind of cute they got matching tattoos together"
14961,"who got matching tattoos ? i 've only seen that actual guardians movie , not any with them as additional characters ."
14962,"the article says the avengers got tattoos , except mark buffalo for some reason ."
14963,did you know that the avengers movie caused sales in shawarma to the up ?
14964,"i do n't know what shawarma are ? ? 've never seen the original hulk tv series , but i 'm kind of surprised lou ferrigno is still around"
14965,i 've seen repeat of the origianl hulk show . it was pretty good . lou ferrigno played the hulk while ville sixty played bruce .
14966,"and he 's still dong voice for , good or him . bill sixty i 've never heard of"
14967,i think he was a popular actor back in the 1970s . it is cool that even though they may replace the hulk physically ferrigno i still his voice .
14968,do you follow tennis at all ?
14969,"only occasionally when there 's a big tournament like wimbledon , or if i see a big name like serena williams . waht about you ?"
14970,i like roger and rafael
14971,i do n't think i 've had of them . are they major players ?
14972,they are o nthe mens ' side
14973,"i do n't know many mens ' players besides rogue federer , ruffle nadal , and novak djokovic ."
14974,do you recall who the only black man to win a u . s . title was ?
14975,i ca n't say i do . who was it ?
14976,arthur ashe
14977,"that name sounds familiar , now that you mention it . does he still pay tennis ?"
14978,"no , he has passed away . serena and ones are the only black champions around today ."
14979,they are both amazing players . serena ha sweden 1 in women 's tennis for over six years in total .
14980,what are we good to do when serena leaves the game . who is th next major player to take her to t ?
14981,"angelique herbert did beat serena at wimbledon last year , though i do n't think her overall record can match serena 's ."
14982,she did well and sergeant lost he u . s open too
14983,"the one who won the u . s . open , noti osama , i think he name was ? , wasa n amazing player . she could easily be one to rise to th 1 spot in the future ."
14984,agreed . i do like her alot . i think she is the future of tennis for sure .
14985,i wonder if we 'll ever see someone break the record that serena shares with stefani graf for holding hte 1 place the longest .
14986,stefani is my all tiem favorite player . i think her adn serena could beat many of the high ranked men on the tournament .
14987,"serena adn venus once said they could beat any man ranked 200 or lower , and the 23rd ranked male palmer beat them both , event huge they 're both incredible ."
14988,"serena was pregnant when she last won the australian , how amazing is that !"
14989,that 's mindblowing ! think of how many people cant do that went when they are n't pregnant .
14990,"i believe serena has bee nat the top of her peers about 319 weeks . , please hit done as my button is not working , ."
14991,"serena definitely has earned her pot . , n o problem , mine just lit up this torn ! ,"
14992,hit here . you a tennis fan . i played a lot . i love that you can play singles or doubled !
14993,i 'm not really . i like tha grunting lady though . what is her name ? . she grunt a pol . some in the tennis circle consider grunting before a shot to be a kind of cheating .
14994,"haha oh , i sharapova maybe ? a black man wont he 1st us open title despite everyone calling it a country club sport !"
14995,that 's interesting ! was that before 1978 ? that is when denis players had to stop using just any object as a racket .
14996,yes it was it was in 1968 !
14997,i have a lot of admiration for the williams sisters .
14998,as do i . once i met them and got their autograph ! g axel monfils is a tennis player bu the beat one of the est paddle tennis players lol !
14999,nice ! it 's cool that serena is a coowner of the miami dolphins now as well .
15000,yeah that is very neat . they also speak fluent french and italian !
15001,"nice ! i wonder how they found time for anything besides tennis , ha . it 's cool that serena williams . the first tennis player , man or woman , to have ever gotten the career golden slam ."
15002,agreed . that is a huge accomplishment . in 2007 serena was ranked 95th but still beat out sharapova for th australian do title .
15003,i also cant believe that serena williams went pro at age 13 .
15004,yeah that is mind blowing got she even won her 23rd grand slam while 2 months pregnant .
15005,"that is an amazing feat . speaking of grand slams , roger federer did n't win any in 2011 but he ended djokovic 's 43 hatch winning streak ."
15006,that iss till a big accomplishment ! federer is the man ! h e was number one for 310 weeks !
15007,and h has nerve retire from a attach once it was started . he has even on hours or more than 13 years
15008,amazing . in 2007 he played nadal on a copy that was half grass and half clay !
15009,"wow , how do that work ? it 's ironic how he got super injured though ."
15010,yea too bad . federer is so god in addition to medals he has been gifted 2 cows over the years !
15011,ironic that he did n't get injured on the court but when he stretched too fair white preparing a bath for his daughter ! also i wonder what he did with those cows .
15012,yeah my thoughts exactly . he even has a stamp in switzerland ! have a good day !
15013,bow musc who you know about tennis ?
15014,i heard hat tahoe played mandarin of france king the first round of the u . s . open in august of 2013 . tahoe is only 20 and from maryland .
15015,how did he do ? pro tennis at 20 is very goof
15016,"h beat mnanarino despite having a wild crowd . he hd in prior competition lost blaming his nerves , but won taht match with mandarin ."
15017,late a pretty big upset ! i wonder ow he would far against the likes of federer
15018,"he was so excited to win . he had in the pas beet trick as a teen , isner in 2016 and pushed federer to five sets last year ."
15019,thats really good . against the guy thats rank 3 int he world
15020,he will have to face alex de minor in the second round in arthur arises stadium . ifr remember arthur ashe as a tennis great .
15021,hopefully it will a good match nad does n't take 11 hours to play !
15022,do you follow women 's tennis ? simon alec is ranked no . 1 and lost in the first round
15023,i do . it crazy how som of these upsets happen . i think serena is one of the best women ever
15024,it must be interesting to bey a twin player . do they still wear polo shirts in the competition ? they were originally invented by rene ' the crocodile ' lacoste but adopted by polo players .
15025,i believe a lot of the men do . serena wear wa pantsuit it think . outside of the french open where its baned
15026,i wonder how many african americans are in professional tennis . only one has won the us open title in 1968 and none since .
15027,thats crazy to think about . especially with how good serena has been .
15028,"well , my mistake i meant african men in tennis . i 'm not sure about womens ' records . serena williams has ranked third in the ' e era . ' she has the most grand slam titles in singles , doubles , and mixed doubles ."
15029,i guess it might be hard considering 3 mine have 56 percent of the grand slams since 200
15030,tha thay e a confounding factor if i wonder how long it took the helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts fort he 1969 us open .
15031,must have been a lot of it i wonder if they have changed any drainage since then
15032,you woudl think so . good thing for paddle tennis though ! you can play indoors . us open quarterfinalist gael monfils beat tha ' roger federer of paddle tennis ' just day after learning how to play paddle tennis .
15033,thats some forrest gump skill
15034,"hi , how are you ?"

15086,that woman is all talent . do you know how polo short became famous ?
15087,yes she is . i have no idea how polo became famous . hold did they ?
15088,"rene lacoste , the tennis player invented them"
15089,oh wow that 's cool . is that the lacoste brand ?
15090,"yeah it is , so it was just adopted by other players later"
15091,"got it , that makes sense . did you know that up until 17 , a tennis player could use any object as a racket ?"
15092,"wow , wonder how that worked out . did you know the once used a helicopter to dry a tennis court ?"
15093,"haha that 's hilarious , but i bet it worked pretty well !"
15094,"ye s , right ? do you know how long the longest tennis match lasted ?"
15095,"i do not , how long ?"
15096,11 hours over three days . i chat
15097,do you know much about tennis ?
15098,no . but i do like to watch it l did you hear about novak djokovic sizes with serena williams ?
15099,"yes i remember , it was in the final of the u open last year ."
15100,"yes . serena was fined 17 , 000 by the u . s . tennis association fdr cascading code violation alter being issued a warning ."
15101,"i guess she was losing thye final and got angry and started yelling at the umpire . i feel bad for the winner , all the focus is o serena , not the person that won ."
15102,"the you have a point . a lot of emotions that day . but plenty of people pointed out that male stars ahve alot being legalized for worse co , cents ."
15103,"i not he has a bit of history of bad behavior on the tennis court , probably counted against her ."
15104,"ok . did not know that . there is also an opinion that the chair umpire should note ave pushed serena to the limit , especially in a gray slam final ,"
15105,"do you watch much tennis ? i really like to see roger federer , he 's really stylish when he 's playing ."
15106,"no , i do not . but yes roger federer is stylish even though novak djokovic had more career earnings than roger federer ."
15107,"tennis is actually a good subject for me , i was born in a town next to wimbledon , i went to one of the schools from which they picked the ball boy san girls ."
15108,ok . that sounds interesting . speaking about tennis . did you know that until 1978 a tennis player was allowed to use a object as racket ?
15109,"they should keep that rule , no one is ever going to break it , but i 'd love to see someone come onto the court with something different , maybe a snow shoe ."
15110,"lol . . . yes , wishing to see another record , hey you remember the longest point in pro tennis history ws a 643shot rally that lasted for 29 minutes ?"
15111,"i thin , might have switched off after shot 300 . another long one was the name that went over three days ."
15112,o ? did you know that serena williams is a coowner of miami dolphins ?
15113,"i was n't aware of that . the could take out some of her anger issues with the football players . she 's won so many tournaments that she must have a few dollars , plus the sponsorship 's ."
15114,i think she did good for herself . she went pro in tennis at the age of 13 and is the firt tennis player fo achieve the career golden slam .
15115,"wow , 13 seems really young . that 's a lot o pressure open a kids , but i suppose if you are good though then play . i know that typically female tennis players mature a lot earlier tha the men ."
15116,"ok . did not know . i think i 'll start to watch more of tennis , even though soccer makes more money than football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis adn hockey combined , and i do like veto wath soccer more taht denis ."
15117,"it was good chatting with you , have a good day ."
15118,are you a pro tennis fan ?
15119,"i am and i really like serena williams , how about you ?"
15120,have . i was very upset witch the lump during 'the u . s . open rand agreed with her frustration .
15121,agreed ! carlos ramos is a great player as well .
15122,"i don ? t think she should have been fined , certainly not 18k !"
15123,i know ! that was just wrong . i think if it would have been a male that would n't have happened .
15124,it was great to see her get the support she did from her fellow players
15125,yes it was . it has to be tough on the and when they are playing under such a high stand
15126,i think obama conducted herself in a dignified manner after all the dram during the match . she was very respectful of williams and her frustration .
15127,"i agree , i think serena is very talented an the does have many who follow and love her ."
15128,osama played well but i believe the u stole the title from williams and gave it to atomic .
15129,yes m that lump ahs a reputation and no ta good one .
15130,i would hope the usa would also fine he jumps as as much but the use seems to be studying behind him instead of the future hall off gamer
15131,i totally agree . the need to have something in place for these use 's . it is just not right .
15132,the whole incident was related on just about every news outlet in the world to include williams ' interviews after the match . you could see ramos was wrong .
15133,definitely ! it 's paid and simple he crossed the line . my 's are only there to analyze the match hot act out . i did n't know this but interesting that even williams is a co owner o the miami dolphins .
15134,"whe has been ranked 1s since 2002 , she should have been given the benefit of the doubt ."
15135,"i agree , she was her 23rd gran slam 2017 she is amazing"
15136,she is an amazing woman fo sur co she also speaks italian and french
15137,very talented . in 2007 the was ranked 95th in the world !
15138,i think sg could beat a majority of the ranked male players on the tour too
15139,oh definitely ! the nba ranked her world 1 in singles for 8 occasions .
15140,i must admit though that my all time favorite women 's player is stefani graf without a doubt .
15141,"are yiu into professional tennis ? i watch it a little , particularly wimbledon . . ."
15142,i do not follow it a lot but a friend does . i heard there is a new guy named tahoe
15143,"yeah , i do n't know him . i kno federer , nadal , m hurry in a few others ."
15144,yes i like 'the williams sisters . serena aids am amazing played
15145,i 've lost track of women 's although i know them from other media exposure e .
15146,yes she was even ranked number 1 on 8 different occasions
15147,"wow , thats ' some record . i did n't realize arthur ashe had a stadium named after him ."
15148,yes . arthur ashe was an amazing player who died o fads sadly .
15149,i knew he was dead . . . i heard he got aids from a blood transfusion . sad .
15150,yes . lol one balck man has ever won the us open and that was back in 1968
15151,who was that ? a little before my time . i did realize that polo shirts originated with lacoste . . . good ol ' good . . .
15152,for sure . dud you know that the longest tennis match was 11 hours long ?
15153,i bet that caused some tennis yellow ; i wonder ho was playing . probably a cat alike a federer and nadal match ; p .
15154,i am not sure but it took 3 days o finish !
15155,that 's crazy . the fans sure got their money 's worth . i bet the williams sisters rule have a match like that .
15156,for sure . they area amazing players ! and they both speak fluent french and italian !
15157,i wish i were more versatile language wish . i could communicate at wimbledon and a u . s . open . i 'd be lost if it were n't in english .
15158,i earned italian and french in school and am teaching myself italian . i love languages .
15159,cool . my degrees are in engineering where elective were few . some actually consider computer languages a ' language . ' i do n't think so . . . i could n't peak to the williams sisters in java . . .
15160,yes i know a lot of computer languages as well but my degree was in math ! i did not know serena was a coowner of the miami dolphins !
15161,tennis has been very good to her . also federer . . . i bet switzerland makes him heir president . . .
15162,yes he has won 56 percent of men ? s grand slam titles since 2000
15163,ifr e was n't so charming id ' swear hes ' some kind of tennis robot .
15164,his biggest industry ever he got while drawing a bath for his daughter !
15165,did you hear roger federer ; lost ?
15166,to nadal ?
15167,"i am not sure , lol . i guess i should have said ' stumble ' im referring took the articles on the left ."
15168,"federer is a fantastic palmer , hes men on the screen for how years ."
15169,i wish i as god at tennis . i am do short . do you wath it a lot ?
15170,"i dont catch too , much of it . it is a long game to watch ."
15171,sweet . did you know serena williams is married to the guy who runs reddit ?
15172,"no , honestly i dont even know who runs reddit ; lol"
15173,alexis ohanian . they have a daughter together . are you a researcher or an mturk worker ? ?
15174,worker . you ?
15175,"worker as well . i like the hits , since they give us topics to talk about . i end up learning a lot of random stuff lol . like that polo shirts were invited for tennis by rene lacoste , and then later adopted by polo players ."
15176,"yeah , a nd his nickname was the crocodile , hence the little crocodile on their shirts ."
15177,"they should just called them ' tennis ' . like , ' hey , can you pick me up some tennis while you 're there ? ' instead of ' polos '"
15178,"i wonder why they took on the same polo , maybe they didnt catch on in tennis until a bit later ."
15179,me . did you knw mo black man has on a us open since 1968 ?
15180,"i didnt , i do know that they were allowed to use any item as a racket until 1978 ."
15181,lol that 's awesome
15182,i could totally see someone reusing their shoe or something crazy like that in a pinch .
15183,and you just know someone tried to art use their pals or fist
15184,i would be like a bad commercial !
15185,i agree !
15186,do yo frequent the library ?
15187,"i do , i use to use it alot more . how about yoy ?"
15188,same . it i sq same considering i toss such a vast and valuable resource
15189,agree . now that they have video games more teenagers going .
15190,"they are trying to make a library of things that allows patrons to use useful things they nee d , but do n't need to own long term"
15191,"yes , the library with its vast of information can help those without access to the internet do incredible things . like a malawian teenager who masked a windmill from thee books ."
15192,i meal a man used the library to prove his innocence nd become a lawyer while falsely imprisoned
15193,how great is that ! so important . the library of alexandria had a unique way of gathering books by making all ships visiting surrender their books for copy .
15194,they must have ha da impressive collection
15195,"how unfair , they would copy their books give them back the copy and keep the originals ."
15196,i guess that is true . do you think we will ever have a decentralized digital library o fall our works and knowledge ?
15197,"i think so , the entertainment executive that would n't hire for a role , got it wrong with ronald reagan , not having the look . lol"
15198,"i guess he was n't president , ike for the executive , but enough so for most americans"
15199,"lo l , k yes . i knew he liked jelly allies , they became very popular then . but , i did n't know they made bluebherry flavor for him ."
15200,did you know he called ice cream nutrition and a wholesome you . if only that was true
15201,"i wish it so . he was also a hero in high school , saving 77 lives as a luifeguard !"
15202,that is no way feat . he sure hada n amazing career rr a hollywood actor top president
15203,i agree . i like the respect eh has given the military by returning the salute in 1918 .
15204,"indeed i hope our next president would be of a similar caliber . in any case , thanks for chatting ."
15205,"yes , you too . have a nice day q goood chat"
15206,the same to you a swell .
15207,"robert m . hilton was ar really good man , who had a short life ."
15208,"i agree with you , seeing the fact that he profited good company and work to those close to him ."
15209,"i am curious to to how h became so well connected in washington , he seems to hav chad a . of power ."
15210,"if you see in article section 2 , you can see how his judgment spread to the success of th reagan establishment ."
15211,"oh , you are right , thanks . he reall did ahve good judgements , he got to say at firstclass hotels during his international travels ."
15212,"i too would provide the best service for my employers who brought in his quality o service ! on a darker note , it 's depressing to see how many deaths we had in 2018 . . ."
15213,"her raised osu much they , and had a good salary , i am curious as tow hat made him choose this path of employment ."
15214,"tell we can see how his fundraising tactics wee successful . ho3evr5 , we can see how he had have been dishonest wit 'the money received ."
15215,"leah 8 agree , i really hate it when someone who many people might lookout to is n't honest with their money , it can have a bad impact on them ."
15216,"exactly . however , i am curious about whether or not download reagan'sf make helped him in electing him for presidency . if you see in factual section 2 ."
15217,"hm , you are right , he did have a lot of connection in washington ."
15218,you know that i think it is ? education . seeing how am an was flares imprisoned and taught himself law to prove is innocence is note worthy . that 's probably how these successful people did will in life
15219,"that was note worthy , however there are often people who are you ninth a rich lifestyle that can get better quality education or knows rami ; y or friends who are in high position sad i feel that is unfair . aww , he had a little dog who was a certified therapy dog ."
15220,"right ? ! the 's probably why he did so well in office . i think if the all had certified therapy doest o help us with oi sword , we 'd get more done ."
15221,"it 's my understanding that mr . hidden stayed with patti davis 's other , or reagan 's wife , that interests me ."
15222,"ia greet it you . it 's hard not to thin that he was not only family associate but almost like a family member , given al that he did for their family . do you think he woud have run for presidency ?"
15223,"he seemed quite interested din politics , i thin they might ahve run if he had n't died bt her were several people wo were popular who died in 2018 ."
15224,yeah i agree with you . given his background . anthony b . was an inspiration to us all .
15225,"anthony b was 61 , it 's shave been hard on his family , losing someone at that ages ."
15226,"true , like robert hilton , he was successful in his area of expertise . speaking of food related stuff , i wonder what ronald vegans favorite ice cream was ."
15227,good question ! i know that he liked ice cream so much he established national ice cream month .
15228,is its ad tat everyday is national icy cream month . . . but whats ' surprising is how there inst bunch of a difference compared to a presidents list of duties .
15229,"presidents are so busy , many people do n't realize king that the must do , or how they have to do it . before the election campaigning is tv lot of hard work , they have to travel to so many different states ."
15230,exactly . i 'm curious to know what it feels like o have that much power . or at least be an affiliate to someone with high level of power . kind of like hilton 's position .
15231,"i know there 's a documentary on reagan 's presidency , there are probably other documentaries that would give a perspective on what it 's like to be president ."
15232,thanks for that ! would you want to hav they name if a prime minister or presiden t ?
15233,"i woulda recommend mqrgaret heather , she rise to power in britain and the bbc ordered ad documentary on her ."
15234,"than you . if you have time , i would suggest watching anthony b 's documentary on his food adventures . i was very nice talking to you ."
15235,have you ever heard of robert m . hilton ? he 's new to me .
15236,he i pretty new to me as well . i heard he was big in the development o reagan 's presidential library .
15237,"i 've always been curious what a presidential library is . never been to one , have this picture in my head of a regular library , must be different ."
15238,"i wonder the same thing , i wonder if it is just a library that he helped tolt fund and sponsor , there is a museum too . i wonder what that has in it ."
15239,"seems he did similar thing for teh british pm , teacher ."
15240,maybe he just really loved all that libraries have to offer and sa wa lot of value in them .
15241,"my daughter loves libraries , she loves to read . i ' glad she does , she needs a book a day . its aves us a lot of moeny ."
15242,"the uk pm back in 1895 founded a library and wheelbarrowed his collection of 32 , 000 books almost a mile to the library ."
15243,"i hope it was n't raining ! i might want to publish a book in norway , a guaranteed 1000 sold to the government ."
15244,"then they get put on libraries , so they are supporting authors andre heading . i think that is fantastic !"
15245,"agree d , reading i wholesome an nutrition for the brain . not sure reagan 's idea that ice cream was the same for the body is right ."
15246,"he had some great ideas , thati as n't one of the . i love ice cream and all , but it is n't exactly nutrition ."
15247,"ware i to live in japan and live to a 100 , i could have my ice dream in a silver cup from the pm ?"
15248,"that is pretty cool , they probably have o start finding a cheaper way to make cups . it seems that there woudl be a lot of people akin gift to 10 fin japan , versus the us ."
15249,"i like the idea of libraries expanding to other things , like the sacramento library where you can get things that useful lilke ewing machines ."
15250,"i think that is . great idea , that way people can checkout things that they might need . it is a great way of community sharing ."
15251,"i wonder if you can check out things from presidential libraries ? i suspect ot , probably more like a museum ."
15252,"probably , especially it there is unique things that c n't be replaced . one thing that is hopeful for the country is there are more libraries than mcdonalds in the us . yay how reading !"
15253,definitely not wholesome and nutrition . i 'm sure mcdonald 's are working on that one .
15254,there is a a who was wrongly convicted in jail and spent his time in the prison library reading law books and the became a lawyer .
15255,"probably a cheaper way than going t college and getting all those students loans . still , the environment would not be nice ."
15256,"he then used his skill to welp there that were in his situation , falsely convicted people . which is pretty neat ."
15257,"have a good , nice speaking with you ."
15258,ha ! i always suspected this ! aladdin 's pants were modeled after c hammer .
15259,haha the mystery has been solved ! have you heard thy are coming outs tv a new aladdin n ? with will smith .
15260,"yeah , iv ' e seen the stills . i do n't like the way it looks really ."
15261,"yeah , me either . the previous makes you curious , but the i saw some pics online , now i just hope mixed feelings ."
15262,disney has been making all these liveaction remarks . ugh . i 'm not sure they are correct here about pants or trousers only existing because of horses . people in very cold countries wore them to keep warm too .
15263,"yeah , that does seem dd when i read it too . different jobs in teh olden times required pants as well . i totally agree with the cold weather too ."
15264,they must have left something out . perhaps it should have read people in temperature climates began wearing pants to ride horses ?
15265,"collinsville , il has a law that prohibits ' saggy pants . ' o feel like this should be everywhere haha"
15266,"saggy pants are annoying , but i don ; t see how they can legally force people not to dress like this ."
15267,5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes . thats really interesting too .
15268,"again , what do they mean by that ? also longer ? fit better ?"
15269,"its very vague . and if htey already know this , why dont they make shoe more like before ."
15270,"well , , the shoes back then were often custommade , that was why i assumed it might be better fitting ."
15271,"putting rye tea rags ins smelly shoes or gym bags will absorb the unpleasant odor . ive actually tied this with my snowboarding books , and it works really well ."
15272,"tea slaves ca cure a lot of prob , ems . they could have 4xpalined the stephon marbury one better too . as this a charity venture ?"
15273,i d not know .
15274,it sounds like it . like how paul negan didnt ' get paid for it food companythe profits are donated to charity .
15275,have you experience any virtual reality devises ?
15276,"yes , my cousin got one last christmas . and one o for best friends also owns a headset ."
15277,"mlb brother in law has one , that device is amazin i also , really scary , it was like a haunted house simulation or something ."
15278,she ha mostly outdoor scenes . this is coollockheed martin has a virtual reality ' mars bus ' that can take kids on a tour o fears .
15279,that would be interesting to experience .
15280,hello . what todo how think of vizsla reality ? i recently learned that the first virtual reality the was made in 1968 !
15281,"hello , i 'm a fan for sure ! i think it ' amazing being able to transport yourself to an imaginary environments and even look around and interact with things , i had no idea the technology existed that long ago !"
15282,i did n't either until recently . some of its less to be geared towards kids and i wish it was n't . take for example lockheed martin . htey have a virtual reality bus that takes kids on a tour of miss . i would like to do that too .
15283,"that 's crazy , i 'm sure a lot of people take advantage of it . although i wonder how kids feel with do , i know a lot of people experience motion sickness sin virtual quality , maybe they could n't handle it ."
15284,i nerve thought about getting motion sickness from i before . i guess it is possible since the brain is perceiving two realities .
15285,"i wonder if the headsets ahve improved since 1968 . i know originally , it was a stereoscopic headmounted display rendering computergeneraed images , but its the it was bunker back then , an maybe lighter and easier to use now ."
15286,with the improvements on computers the headsets are probably a lot smaller and lighter than before . did you know that the scientist who discovered some of saturn 's moons thinks that we are living cgi na comouter generated virtual reality ?
15287,"wow , as much as i want to call him insane he seems more qualified than me , but i 'm still a skeptical . are you interested in clothing at all ?"
15288,i am interested in clothing . i think its very funny to realize that 'the romans thought that wearing pants was a sign of barbarism !
15289,"well i can see where they 're coming from ! i think the only reason peole do wear pants is because to ride a horse in an army , it was more effective to weak pants than rovers ."
15290,yrs btw as unless you were in britain where they rode side saddle . a lot of things are different there . htey consider trousers to be underwear where america considers trousers to be pants .
15291,"that 's really hard to imagine , for us i 'm sure that seems insane . then again , we have our own sculpture that dictates fashion , i know mc hammer 's pants inspire da lot of things , even aladdin 's pants !"
15292,i never knew that ! i thought that aladdin 's pants here from how hte people in that country dressed long ago .
15293,"ahah i thought so also , i guess the culture around pants has banged a knot in modern days . i remeber one ot thye craziest things i saw in the news was a judge suing a dry cleaning business for over 67 billion just over one pair . pants ."
15294,wo wi have n't heard about that ! why did he sue them ? were the pants messed up in some way ?
15295,"i believe the pants got lost ! still that much more for one pair ? maybe he only had saggy pants left and was from collinsville , illinois where they prohibit them !"
15296,"that is way way too much money for one pair and i hope he lost his crass . however , being a judge he probably did n't . now i do know about the collinsville law . what i would like to know s just how do they enforce it . what is cool baggy ?"
15297,"exactly ! i wonder wher 'the line ends too . i bet they have a similar rule for shoes , like you ca n't have shoes too dusty or something !"
15298,of too smelly ! what they need in that case is some dry tea bags . those are supposed to absorb odors in shoes .
15299,"i nee to use that ! i think i have our gym shoes that could use them . i definitely do n't want to throw them out never though they are very old , because i believe very old shoes actually perform better than new shoes !"
15300,h they definitely do ! shoes s far back as 5000 years ago are made so much better than today adn out perform todays shoes by miles .
15301,"that 's crazy , i hope i can somehow find them on the market to test out the theory myself . always , it was nice chatting with you , have a nice day !"
15302,are you a fan of elton jon ?
15303,"hello there , i am not a big fan but think he is very ta ; rented ."
15304,"based on my knowledge , i know that he sings 20th a parking outfit with a neck grand piano ."
15305,"yeah he does , do you know he has sold more ethan 300 million records ? ! that is very impressive ."
15306,he will be a legend ! i believe it 's been 31 years .
15307,"yeah it has , 31 consecutive years that he has had at least one song in the hot 100 ."
15308,"he is 100 percent talented . even , his song ' can you feel the love tonight ' was part of the lion king !"
15309,"yeah i remember that being the big song int hat movie , seems like so long ago ."
15310,that song never ets old ! worth the valentine 's day song ! he has to campaign for it to be in the lion king !
15311,"that is very interesting , i know he played the can , i do n't think he played guitar though , do you know much about the guitar ?"
15312,i am a guitarist . i love playing my guitar . i only play when i am ready for open mic or recording musi .
15313,"that is very cool , that takes a lot of talent . are you a fan of eddie van halen ?"
15314,"i am no ta fan , bu i belive that he had a solo on ' beat it '"
15315,"yeah good call ! i know , is known s benign a really good guitarist as well ."
15316,"he burned th speeders . that is when you know he is pretty good in his music , ."
15317,yeah that is pretty crazy l dod you ever listen to any pink floyd ?
15318,"maybe , i heard a fe you the songs . he had some floating stage ."
15319,"yeah its a band , i 'm only really a fan of their first album but i guess the guitarist probably david gilmour made a houseboat into a studio ."
15320,that is an interesting setting .
15321,yeah thati would actually be very cool leaking musi chile floating down a river or something .
15322,it was nice chatting with you .
15323,do lou have liking for musicals like aide ?
15324,hi how are you ? i do not know that musical . i do like musicals thouhg .
15325,i ca n't say that i 'm a big fan . i did see a version of cats in in london .
15326,that sounds like fun . i know that cats is a famous one . i have never seen it . i should go see it . i do most have the money though .
15327,"i 'd save your money , it was not that good . i guess elton john is involve din some of these musicals ."
15328,mj is z musical talent it i guess not everything is great . h eis a dramatic type and hedy creative but perhaps he should stick o crocodile rockin '
15329,"i think there is a movie coming out soon about him . i know e was involved int has lion king movie , doing its songs , its a musical now ."
15330,elton has written great songs . i hope taht he continues to write . i think hat the lion king musical is not as good as the film . i would not see it .
15331,"do of play any musical instrument , piano or guitar possibly ?"
15332,i do not . i am terrible at the sis . i would love to b enable to ; lay but i am not good at all . you ?
15333,"i too woul , d like to play , and a go with a guitar a couple of times , but not very persistent ."
15334,"it is difficult to be a musician . it takes practice and time and talent and i do not have any of these . i think that the guitar is the coolest of all instruments , cooler than the xbox and passion ."
15335,"yes , look love to be able to play music on a suit r , some queen or pink floyd would be great ."
15336,"those are classic bands with great songs . i for could play those songs , you would get all kinds of friends . you would be a star on the guitar . what kind of costume would you wear though"
15337,i 'm fairly conservative when it comes to clothing . i would certainly not wear what elton john used to in the seventeen .
15338,' was a trendsetterw ho stood out from the crowd . i could not wear his clothes i public . i would feel awkward . you would have to wear something to be as a though . maybe dress as a saunflower ?
15339,"he can wear what i wants , he 's sold over 300 million records . i doubt if he cares how people judge him ."
15340,"dig suess he coudl wander abut in the buff ifr e so chose . he has sold many records and his style is not the reason for that . i dan be a free spirit . elton , wherever you are , f ' free . you diva ."
15341,or a panda costume liek those panda researcher swear .
15342,"that would ne so elton ! he knows no boundaries . anyway , great chat !"
15343,have a good day . try t wear an interesting costume for hte rest o the day .
15344,hey ! i sas thinking of seeing elton john in concert . tickets are around 4555 bucks . does that sound reasonable ?
15345,that is a good price for the man who sang ' candle in the wind 1997 '
15346,especially since he has over 50 top 40 hits . i ca n't believe he has sold over 300 million record sand i get to see him live !
15347,good for you ! seven consecutive number one albums lisa lso an impressive record .
15348,"no joke q i really hope his lyricist since 1967 , bernie tapping , will be there !"
15349,what is elton john 's real name ? i forget .
15350,his current name is sir elton hercules john but he was born regional kenneth dwight ! i did n't realize hehe changed so much about himself just to perform .
15351,true . i wonde be he will change it back . when was he born ? i know he is retiring from touring .
15352,he as born the 25 of march in 1947 . i did not realize how old he was ! the songwriting partner i was talking about was born in 1967 . i also did n't know there was such an age difference .
15353,interesting . which performer did elton johns el with in the 2013 grammys ?
15354,ed sheeran . even though i 'm not a huge a it was a great performance . what do you love most about elton ?
15355,i likd songs like ' your song ' . can you believe btw as originally written for 3 dog night !
15356,no way ! i think that would ruin the song completely ! just like cutting the song ' can you feel the love tonight ' from the lion king would ruin thati 've . they almost did cut it but it went on to win an oscar for best original song .
15357,i enjoyed the broadway version of the line king . impressive costumes !
15358,i agree ! so thinking back to the concert i ma mad that the show os only two and a hal hours . i could stay their all night !
15359,"sell , shows have to need sometime or the speakers might at on fire like they did or eddie van halen one time ."
15360,he was recording the solo for ' beat it ' i believe . he is really great too . i was incorrect about soemthing i i earlier . i stated that bernie tapping was born in 1967 but that is actually the date ego end him became partners . sorry for the misinformation .
15361,"no problem . dome guitar players are really smart , brian may has a phd in astrophysics ."
15362,i hear he used pics as guitar picks as well . that is just crazy ! i wonder what other crazy things other guitarist he done !
15363,"well , matthew belalmh hold htey guinness world record for smashed guitars on a tour ."
15364,i lodge mr . bellamy ! i like pink floyd also . they turned a houseboat into a floating recording studio and called it teh astoria . it is crazy what some musicians will do with for this music .
15365,"true , but sod o otter professions . some panda researchers wear panda costumes to work !"
15366,i guess that is just like hte hogg costumes they used in labyrinth . well i am going to go get my tickets now it has been a pleasure talking to you !

15396,"i made lost of money , so it was a winner in that respect , maybe it will will prove to be a winner in the awards too . there was another superhero movie that did well in 2017 , so i hope that ' logan ' dope n't take away from some of the credit ww might get otherwise ."
15397,that 's right ! did you kno gal godo served 2 years as a soldier ?

15420,"that is pretty interesting . what do you think about antman ? apparently ye made his debut before spiderman , the hulk , thor . or even iron man"
15421,"i did n't know that . they were good movies , a different kind of superhero"
15422,"what 's crazy though is that 80 percent of the dial ; vogue in thor ragnarok was actually improvised , maybe thats how i liked it"
15423,"wow , i did not know that ! id on ; t like ethan disney owns the rights to marvel now"
15424,i do n't like that either . it seems like they have too much tha they own now . they even own star wars !
15425,"rights , t jack about a monopoly . theyd re taking everything marvel and disney off netflix which is al ; l i watch basically !"

15465,yeah it was good too l te guys ho player ralph in a christmas story was the producer of it
15466,"in the beginning , the people who look only stark reveal the whole plot of the movie in the language of turd"

15468,thats very cool . did you know the richest superhero is black panther ?
15469,"nice , did now know tha t , thought maybe tony stark ws , he seems to have z lot o money"
15470,yeah black panther has an estimated worth of 500 billion ! t hat is a lot of money
15471,wow that sure is . the guy who did the voice of jarvis has never seen the movies
15472,"wow , jarvis also stands for just a rather very intelligent system"
15473,yea hand it is voiced by paul bettany . do you know why stan lee created ironman ?
15474,i did know that . did you know the spaceships in thor are named after old australian cars ?
15475,"haha thaat i so cool , did not know that . the actor that plays loki originally auditioned for the role of thor"
15476,awesome . odin 's ravens in thor alaska appear in the avengers film too

15478,do you watch any of te marvel movies ? they are so of my favorites
15479,i love marvel movies . i really like the first iron man . i 'm super impressed that obey downey jr . improvised it all .
15480,"there was n't even a script ! no wonder it was such a great movie ! he only made 500k for that first movie , too !"
15481,"yeah , i read he made 10 million for the second one ."
15482,sometimes it pays to stick around for the sequel . the person who does the voice f jarvis has never actually watched the movies
15483,wow . that 's crazy . stan lee created iron man because ye did n't think anyone would like him . i get you never know what going to happen
15484,heist he kind of guy that we love to hate . stan lee is a genius though for testing all the heroes that he has
15485,did you hear thatd disney does n't own the rights to big marvel characters in theme parks earth of the mississippi ?
15486,"isn ' f that due to a deal they made it universal studios ? some of th rides at their park are based off marvel characters , and that woudl be hard to move"
15487,"yeah , i guess it was because for a deal they signed with universal studios in the 90s"
15488,but they could utilize the marvel character sweat soft he mississippi if they wanted . both marvel and dc both own one character for th sole purpose of keeping the universes separate
15489,"yeah , i or his name is access . funny name considering what he is used for ."
15490,very true . i wonder if that was q name that stan lee came up with . he did create one called blue ear just for a 4 year old who needed hearing kids
15491,"i do n't know , these contract deals are aways so weird . apparently fox didnt think marvel was worth 25 million , so they only bought spiderman for 10 million"
15492,"they did a the version of him i nthe time they had the rights , and now they 've made a deal with marvel . they definitely didnt lee that outcome"
15493,did you hear marvel successfully argued in court that mutants are not people ; le ? it goes against he whole idea behind the xmen
15494,"i 'm surprised the judge went for that one , but maye they were unfamiliar with the movies . that 's a strange argument to get a lower rate than that for dolls"
15495,"i mean they are toys , and not doll 'm so i sorta agree ."
15496,"i guess it depends on your perspective . ike , i wonder why thor got his first movie before antman when antenna was created first"
15497,because thor is more popular .
15498,did they make that decision based in comic books sales . sometimes i wonder what the deciding factors are
15499,"all there , did you see the iron man movies ?"
15500,"i saw that in theatres years ago , it ot me loving marvel moves , how about you ?"
15501,"i actually never saw th movie for some reason , but heard that toy stark has a lot o money ."

15503,"tha i crazy , and the real robert downey only and 500 , 00 for the first on debut then 10 mill for the 2nd !"
15504,"man , that was a big pay increase foil . k did n't like iron man 2 too much"
15505,yeah state is a crazy ay raise from one to the next ! i did n't realize the first film did so well .
15506,"for sure , i just remember leaving the theatres thinking what an awesome movie ! who would have guessed what was to come after that . do you know paul bettany ?"
15507,i think he did some of the voices in the movies right ?
15508,he was jarvis in those movies . apparently he never patched hem lol
15509,lol that id hilarious ! i do n't know how you would n't want to see the final product you have been working on .
15510,"right , maybe he was made mad he way just a voice"
15511,"lol , well i 'm sure e wares n't mad when he got his paycheck for guest being a voice ."
15512,"for sure , that is he perfect job for me . shy on camera but can talk on the radio if i ended o lol"
15513,"yeah i would n't mind just being a voice e , i always wanted to work for my local radio station lol ."

15522,"it 's hard to choose one , i early like the captain america and the pros haha movies , how about you ?"
15523,"while my favorite is hulk , i did really like the captain america movie . it 's the best of both worlds because he meets up with tony stark ."
15524,"yes true . thor is pretty goo as well , the hulk was seen as an immense green symbol of airship to thor in the movie ."
15525,i really enjoyed hte relationship what thor and hulk had in thor : ragnarok . i really think they worked well together ? if they had to square up and fight who do you think would have the upper hand ?
15526,that 's a tough question . . . . i would have to say hulk only because he has seniority on thor i think . . . lol !
15527,yah that would be an epic batter . i wonder where marvel got all there inspiration for these characters . i know marvel has bed proud since 1939 but when disney took over they really started amzing excellent films .
15528,"yes , the creativity in the characters is really great , it would be fun to find out what or who inspired each character . i did n't know that marble had been around since 1939 ."
15529,had they really started to take off when stan lee and jack girly started to create . they made the fantastic four also .
15530,oh that 's another great one ! i see that iron man is the first film in the marvel cinematic universe .
15531,ye s iron ma nwas wildly popular . do you think it was such a hit because of the character of iron man himself or because of the acting of robert downey jr . ?
15532,"you know , i was just wondering that also , i think robert owns jr is the perfect actor for the part , i would n't imagine anyone like . i would have to say it 's because of him in this particular part . what do you think ?"
15533,"i think his acting was great but i also think that iron man himself draws in a crowd . his costume just looks too bet . i have young kids myself and we enjoy watching it together . i think that other actors could have done equally well . of al 'the costumes an weapons , what would be your favorite of the characters ?"
15534,"oh wow , i could n't choose just one . his costume stands out to em , so i would choose it ."
15535,right . for me i am intrigued by the homer from thor . i wish i was that thing to swing around at my will . i enjoyed watching him use it while reading up with hulk .
15536,"ha ha , true ! i also like how the avengers learn how to cast aside individual egos and plug their strengths together for greater good ."
15537,"yeah to me th avengers shows a power struggle on which superhero will be the leader . i think her iron man takes the cake . throughout the conversation we did not bring up perhaps the most famous superhero of the marvel bunch , none other that spiderman"
15538,"i was just thinking the same thing , when you asked e about costumes , he came to mind . i really do like spiderman as well ."
15539,"me too , the homecoming series has been my favorite of th bunch . i would love to see a peter parker and tony stark mcvie were they both are unaware of heir special powers ."
15540,that ? s a great idea for a movie storyline !
15541,hi . do you watch superhero movies ?
15542,i do ! i just watched avengers the other day ! have you seen wonder woman ?
15543,"i have n't , bit i should ! it wa the highest grossing superhero movie !"
15544,"i know ! i 've see nthe dark knight too , have you ? it was th highest before wonder woman ."
15545,i did . i did n't realize batman 's character was created in 1939 !
15546,hes ' been around a long he . did you see logan ? ish ave n't yet .
15547,i have n't seen that either . there are a lot of superheros to keep up with ! bout 300 in the us
15548,there are a lot ! gal gadot won a critics choice award for ponder woman !
15549,she thought sew as auditioning for catwoman when she tried out for that role .
15550,thats crazy ! stat would be odd to do . i did not know this ! there was a comic series about fix gate collateral damage caused by superheroes
15551,there is also a superhero called normalman who has no superpowers . haha .
15552,"hm ! i wonder what eh does ? just call himself a superhero ? : ,"
15553,i thanks so ! he 's the only one without superpowers on a planet o superheroes .
15554,that 's fun ! stunk lee wrote 15 dc comics ! he was in the avengers movie i just watched too !
15555,very cool ! apparently gotham city is in new jersey . who knew !
15556,"i wonder if that was where they filmed too ? not only is wonder woman the highestgrossing superhero origin movie , it is also the highestgrossing wwi movie"
15557,i 'm not sure ! that 's interesting . gw gadot was a soldier in the israeli defense forces !
15558,"i had no idea ! this is cool . . with , star wars : hte last jedi , beast and the beast , wonder woman , 2017 was the first year since 1958 , south pacific , auntie mate , cat on a hot tin roof , that the top 3 highest grossing domestic films were female , ed ."
15559,stats ' a long time ! wonder woman was in dawn off justice the year before wonder woman the movie came opt .
15560,omg ! rid you see this ? there was a batman villain named condiment king and he was defeated by slipping on his own ketchup !
15561,too funny ! i learned a lot about superheros ! thanks for chatting .
15562,"hi , do you like superhero movies ?"
15563,yes . of course e ! i guess ponder woman is the best favorite .
15564,i ; moved the movie . did you watch it ?
15565,"n , but i guess i better watch the dvd . is it time for woman 's equality among hte superheroes ?"
15566,yeah . it was the highest grossing superhero origin movie ?
15567,wow . is n't it interesting that none of hte superhero movies where every nominated for the best picture at the oscars .
15568,yeh that is strange . do you know who plays wondr woman ?
15569,"gal want . i really co n't recognize her , since i did n't see the movie and i dont remember her in other forms . i guess the dark knight wa swap expected to be nominated in 2008 , and it was n't"
15570,yeah that is her . ashe served in israeli defence forces
15571,she 's very involved in the me too movement . so maybe wonder woman is in a good position for awards .
15572,yeah there you go . she did not even know she was auditioning for the movie
15573,really ? huh . that 's interesting . i'ts hard to imagine that the superhero comics books go back to the 1930s .
15574,yeah that is a ; in time . do you like batman ?
15575,yes . i even remember the batman tv show . ha . i do 'the fantastic four and they avengers . the group stories are always good .
15576,. much better than the individual superhero movies
15577,did you know that there are around 30 superhero movies coming out from 20162020
15578,"taht is amazing , . have you heard of the batman villain called condiment king"

15588,"they did ? wo w , i though it was all camera magic lol ! ia lso loved jurassic world and could n't wait for this one to come out"
15589,it took 6 hours to render one frame of the rain soaked t ex ink jurassic park ! good thing that first movie made a ton of money lol
15590,"whoa , that 's crazy ! yes , they are not in need of any moeny for sure ! funny too the they use an elephant roar to depict the t he roar ."
15591,"oh wow , that cool , never done made the connection lol"

15593,i do like fish ! my favorite sea animal is the or . that is really long lol a goldfish .
15594,"right ? i read taht a koi fish once lived for 226 years , its name was hanako . amazing ! sometimes i think insects live that long too haha . . ."
15595,that is interesting ! that is a type of jellyfish and lobster that is immortal
15596,"that 's odd ! i find that interesting ! speaking of insects , i love dragonflies ! some species can fly for 5 , 000 miles without stopping , so awesome !"
15597,"thats impressive ! kinda like birds migrating , they don sleep or stop either lol"
15598,"bu tdragonflies only live a few weeks , maybe a year if lucky ! they have to fly fast . dragonflies during mating form a shape of a heart , that 's interesting ! there are more tha , , 000 species of dragonflies as wel l , they all eat insects so that 's good lol"
15599,"yes , that is awesome . did you know tiny red bugs found in concrete are called glover mitres ?"
15600,"no i did not know that , those little pesky insects ! lol , i m just happy there are a lot of other insects that at insects , t here are do many !"
15601,"anytime you see ingredients that contain caroline , cochineal extract or natural red 4 . . . . the product contains crushed bugs !"
15602,"ew 21 ! ! no way ! i am not eating those ingredients any longer lol , yuck ! i will stick too all natural foods like fish and veggies lol"
15603,"same here , i am going o be looking at ingredients all the time now ! who thought it was a good idea to use crushed bugs in our food and why did it get approved , ugh"
15604,blah ! i agree ! insects have no place in my life or belly haha !
15605,"unless , m in the dessert and its a survival thing lol then i 'd eat all the bugs lol"
15606,"i would proabably just die . . . i have the drivers as we speak , phobia about insects lol . . ."
15607,"yeah its disgusting for sure , but if its litle or death i 'll do it , this is why i always have soy sauce pocket in my car . . . ? if its life or death at least i can coat btw with soy sauce lol its been exclelejt chatting with you , that you very much ."
15608,"hi , how are you ?"
15609,i am well . thank you . did you happen to see jurassic world : fallen kingdom ?
15610,i did not . i only saw the first chris pratt one . did you see it ?
15611,yes i saw both . in fallen kingdom the dinosaurs actually only appear on screen for 15 minutes .
15612,"wow , that is ot a lot of 'm , i would have thought it was longer . i wonder if they has a small cgi budget ."
15613,"i 'm not sure about that cg budgets u the movie budget was 63 million . surprisingly , the jurassic park ride cost more to make at 110 billion m ."
15614,pratt joked with spielberg about giving him the part in 2100 . foreshadowing ? ? ? ?
15615,wow ! that 's very funny that he would later end up in it then . they were huge parts fdr him too .
15616,"yeah . he was ripped in the movies too . he did not look like andy lawyer from parks and rec , that 's for sure ."
15617,no h did not . i watched that first also and was shocked when he became an action star . did you know that one frame of the car soaked trey takes six hours torn ender ? that 's an insane amount of work .
15618,the raptors hard humans inside of teh suits ? that seems more archaic think i would have thought .
15619,really ? ! i assumed they were entirely cg . i have to imagine that they do least used some cg over teh practical .
15620,i would think so . di you ever read the creighton book jussaric park ?
15621,"i did not . it 's everywhere whe i was a , id and it seemed like everyone was but i just never got around to it ."
15622,it 's on top the reasons i never saw the original . i loved the book so much . did n't want to think my love of it by some crappy movie .
15623,that makes sense . it 's always harder adder the book . are you at all interested in fish ?
15624,i am . are you ?
15625,i do find the interesting . did you know that there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal ? i hope we are studying why .
15626,"i feel like ethan needs to be studied more ! i want to live longer , maybe not immortal but maybe until i am 150 . . ."
15627,i absolutely agree . i would love to know that marks that possible . another interesting fact is that the seahorse i 'the only fish with a neck .
15628,nice chatting with you !
15629,"it sure has been raining a lot lately , i wonder if thats the reason of the increase on xragonflies"
15630,"it seem so . since there is ore rain , there are ore mosquitos or the dragonflies to feast on ."
15631,"i so they feast on mosquitos , than kdragonflies then lo l , i just hate mosquitos , although dragonflies are kind of scary"
15632,"appartently a dragonfly can eat 30 mosquitos a day . like you said , thank you dragonflies ! i did n't realize dragonflies were such predator . all their wings tallow tiem fly better than their prey ."
15633,i think it interesting how dragonflies form ac closed circle in a shape of a heart when they are amazing
15634,i ca n't realy imagine . that works . who knew dragonflies were so romantic ? i guess when you only live for less than a year you make the most of your life .
15635,"i guess so lol , tey sure are taking advantage of their time one garth , m insects are interestin , have you ever eaten somethng with caroline or cachineal extract in it ?"
15636,maybe ? i 'm not even sure what taht is .
15637,"well it san ingredient found on some food and on the red 4 coloring , when you see a label with any of those ingredient beware as you are eating crushed up bugs ."
15638,"what ? really ? i did not know that ! i have heard of bugs being used to color nail polish and other comsetics , but i was unaware it was in food . i do n't know what to think abou that . do i remain obvious or research it more ?"
15639,"maybe obvious as you might be surprise , i would rather remain in ignorance lol , there is a species of insects called gold bugs ."
15640,are gold bugs like beetle or flying bugs ? i do n't like bugs that fly . just like you said dragonflies are scary . they have fast an come out of nowhere .
15641,"jim think hey are totally different , their usual name i sextremophiles they breath dissolved gold and excrete it in a solid form"
15642,"oh my gosh , you are a wealth of knowledge . i love it"
15643,"bugs sure are interesting , to think they can be found in almost every environment !"
15644,i imagine that there is a vast amount of species of insects and bugs . i never would 've realized that there are even bugs in the ocean .
15645,"apparently there are , did you know that 90 percent of all animals on earth are actually insects , no wonder why my place is full with mosquitos ."
15646,"you need to get ou some dragonflies to deal wit those mosquitoes . where i live sand goats are a huge issue , bt i never see any dragonflies helping me out . i guess you would need a source of water nearby to be able to host the dragonfly nymphs before they hatch ."
15647,"i think i will do that , hopefully it work see now i will have two problems instead of one lol !"
15648,": , haha , find out who th edragonfly 's predator is so hot have a backup plan just in case they get out of hand ."
15649,if that does n't work either i will be in serious trouble then lol i might end up with a zoo at my home and mosquitos would stills i me .
15650,"hey , did you know there is a species of fish that is immortal ? how cool is that ?"
15651,really ? where is this species sound ?
15652,im not 100 percent but i believe not too far from japan . ;
15653,aired dolphins considered fish ?
15654,no i dont think so as they are mammals and note ish .
15655,what about octopus what are they considered d ?
15656,they would be closer to a clam or bullock . again no 100 percent but i think different than fish .
15657,do you know which insect happens to be the first nonhuman meant farmers ?
15658,"no , i dont ! w hitch insect ?"
15659,it was an african breed of ants .
15660,thats so wild ! i did just find out that if you are eating or drinking something with naturals reed 4 it has bugs in it .
15661,"omg , that probably means my red delved cake might have a little bit of bugs in it lol"
15662,totally q did you know that seahorses are the only fish to have a neck ?
15663,"now that i think about it those are the only fish you see with actual necks , do you know which fish it is that has a head that i transparent ?"
15664,"yeah , once i thought about it it seemed obvious . no which ?"
15665,"i 'm pretty sure they 're called barreleye fish , they never really mentioned any of the more unique ones when i was watching spongebob s a kid"
15666,interesting . do yoy know if there is a fish with 2 hearts ?
15667,"no lol i know there 's cows with 3 stomachs , but 2 hearts is something else , what is the fish called ?"
15668,i dont know . ther is a beer called 2 hearted dale wit ha big fish on it so i alway wondered .
15669,do you know which fish is compose doom mostly water actually 9 7percent of it to be exact ?
15670,i dont . love a great day !
15671,thank you my friend it was great
15672,good morning . putting on my polo shirt which ironically was invented for tennis .
15673,who invented the shirt ?
15674,rene ' the crocodile ' lacoste was the inventor .
15675,"oh , this is the famous ipod shirt ? i guess there is also polo shirts , which are worn mostly by people no playing polo . the hawaiians have the right idea about office attire ."
15676,for sure . i ' e rather wear the aloha shirt than a suit and tie any day .
15677,"in he uk , they call the trousers , but we in the us cal them ' pants . '"
15678,some cities actually have laws prohibiting g ' saggy pants '
15679,"i think it 's a floppy look , and p ; probably a bit too revealing for some folks . i laughed when i saw that a d . c . judged sued a dry cleaner for millions over a lost pair of pants . i wonder heather it was for pain and suffering ."
15680,"year , 67 million to bee exact . that 's crazy . he should have been fined for such a frivolous lawsuit like that ."
15681,"it 's an abuse of judicial power , green if the judge hired a lawyer . i would expect a judge t throw off suits like that , since they cloud up the system ."
15682,"ia greet completely . i wonder what his pants looked like l now if they are aladdin 's pants which were modeled after mc hammer 's pants , maybe they would be worth 67 million ."
15683,i honestly expected dmc hammer 's pants to be modeled after aladdin ' sr ot seems strange that the romans thought pant were barbaric . i wonder why pants same civilized .
15684,"not sure , but apparently pants were originally worn by mounted armed on horseback ."
15685,"i wonder how the romans felt about socks , especially with hte sandals that they wore ."
15686,i bet if got cold though they could do like the japanese and put chile peppers in the socks to keep the toes weary .
15687,that would make for some interesting smelling feet . i did n't know that socks were originally designed to eb worn with sandals . nowadays the loop fish considered a goofy dad look .
15688,"yeah , i only do that if i 'm running out t get the mail or somethings ."
15689,"the foot produces a lot of wear , so the socks help absorb it . maybe if a celebrity made thiel do popular , it would be acceptable generally ."
15690,"probably so . like if billy mays work them with his we shirts and khaki pants , that might have worked ."
15691,who is bill mays ?
15692,"he was the infomercial guy , sold oy cream for years ."
15693,i 've never heard of him . did he always wear blue shirts and khaki pants ?
15694,"that was his thing . was , it 's been nice chatting with you this morning ."
15695,nice chatting ! bye
15696,do you have a favorite style of shirt ?
15697,"i like t shirts . i dont are for press shirts , or shirts that hav a vertical opening with buttons ."
15698,do you have a favorite band or designer ?
15699,not necessarily . i guess if i had to choose it would be nike or under armour . i wonder if they could wear them in hawaii the they get to wear aloha shirts to work instead of suit and tie .
15700,i lke under armour too . the game grea moisture licking shirts
15701,that would n't work too well in china during the cultural revolution where they layered as many shirts as possible .
15702,do you believe e should buy shirts and clothes fro china ?
15703,i have no problem with it . restricting trade between china and us would only hurt us consumers . j wonder if they ban ' saggy pants ' in china like they do in collinsville ?
15704,saggy pants hands skinny jeans should be banned everywhere
15705,that 's funny . hat else is funny is that a judge in d . c once sued a dry cleaner for losing a pair o his pants .
15706,wow . the chinese like to dress in layers and started the ' pop you collar ' craze .
15707,i heard that . funny how fads start . the romans actually though wearing pants were a sign of barbarism .
15708,it was only recently were congressman allowed to wear skirts on the house or senate floor
15709,i know . that does n't sound right . should have one like that long before it hat judge ethan i spoke of earlier sued for a million for lost pants . that 's crazy .
15710,did he win his case ? seem like al ot of money to sue for over pants .
15711,i imagine not . no judge should have been allowed to do tha . it is a totally frivolous lawsuit .
15712,"for lure , fifa anybody shoudl know that in would be him ."
15713,it 's not like the dry cleaner lost mc hammer 's iconic pants bt hose were actual ; fly what the creators of aladdin used as a model for his pants .
15714,maybe that is why thy sued to so much because of how valuable they were
15715,"possible , y . well , it 's been nice chatting with you ."
15716,you s well .
15717,"hello , are you into fashion clothing ?"
15718,"yes . i do like ralph lauren . you , know polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene lacoste ."
15719,"ahh . makes sense now . in england , a shirt is defined as a bit with a collar ."
15720,ok . did not know that . yes the official business and offic attire in hawaii is aloha shirt instead of a suit and tie .
15721,"oh wow . . that is awesome ! in china , gangsters wore as many shirts as they could !"
15722,"test is interesting . did you know that socks are among the most needed items ar homeless shelter , yet among the least often donated ."
15723,"yes , in fact amazon had a video where homeless someone would ask homeless what they needed and they say socks , then a couple hours later it was delivered !"
15724,"that is nice . did you know that collinsville , has a law that prohibits saggy pants ' , weird ?"
15725,they had that in my school . did you know the man viewed pants as barbaric ?
15726,"yes . speaking about it , alladin 's pants were modeled after mc hammer ."
15727,"wow , you would think it wa 'the other way around . the brits call them trousers"
15728,"i know , and a s . c . judge sled a small dry cleaning business for over 67 million for the loss of a pair of pants ."
15729,the oldest surviving pair of socks ever found ws designed to wear with sandals
15730,"you know with all the drama that was said in the end , all that matters is doing whats best for my client . taht is how business works ."
15731,oh tune reactor who used semi rude models ? thats crazy for a house that was valued at 130k
15732,"yes , i now . that was a good business move . goldeneye , the creator , found 100 complaints , crazy ?"
15733,that meant 10000 people saw the ad he said .
15734,"yes , a winwin . and it took only 40 days after it was listed o get those views . good innovative idea ."
15735,other reactors gave tacos or wore panda suits !
15736,"right ? and it took kristin goldeneye , the creator , only 24 hours after she posted images from the risque photo shoot , for 20 , 000 people to click on the listing . successes ."
15737,crazy . take care .
15738,thanks you . you too .
15739,": ,"
15740,enjoy your day .
15741,you do the lame .
15742,yes . thank you .
15743,good night
15744,do yu know wh published the comic back panther is based on ?
15745,i do not .
15746,"ok . is now it is part o the marvel cinematic universe , so would guess it was marvel ."
15747,yeah . have you seen b ; hack heather ?
15748,"yes , i relaly like director ryan coogler ."
15749,i thought the movie was really well done . it exceeded my expectations .
15750,i also really enjoy stars michael b . jordan andc chadwick boseman .
15751,they did a great job in that movie . i thought michael d jordan did really well as i do not orally like him . boseman was awesome !
15752,i was surprised yo hear taht black panther is actually the riches superhero . always thought that was batman .
15753,it 's that vibranium money ! i would take either amount though . . .
15754,"speaking of chadwick boseman , did you kno whe has a vast with denzel washington !"
15755,i and not know that . . . do you know how ?
15756,"denzel paid for boseman o go to an oxford theater program , then tey meta t the premiere of black panther ."
15757,"wow , that 's crazy ; . did you see wonder woman ?"
15758,i did . i find it amazing that the flick is the highest grossing wwi movie !
15759,yeah ! s he best as the justice society 's secretary ! how sexist . . .
15760,"true , but that was way back in 1941 ! di you know gal gadot was actual ; y in the israel defense forces ?"
15761,i heard that . i think she was perfect cast in that movie . anyone bigger would have taken away from teh movie .
15762,can you imagine her streep even a younger one in that role ?
15763,i am not sure i could see her in that role . i see her as to well now . . . am i right in thinking that ?
15764,"perhaps , although her first film role was in a sports movie ."
15765,i did not know that . nice chatting with you !
15766,have you seen the black panther movie ?
15767,no i have not see it yet but i really can to . i know its an all african american cast and historic in that way .
15768,yes . it was pretty good . i wo n't share any movie revealing details then if you have n't see it . the blank panthers has an estimated 500 billion dollars nad is the richest superhero .
15769,wow . i know it 's the richest superhero in history too . the marvel comics character black panther was not named after the black panther party . which i jist learned .
15770,that 's correct . the symbols and written script from hte movie are based on an actual script cleaned nsibdi .
15771,"amzing , i love when things are historical i na movie because it makes it more believable . chadwick boseman was accepted in to a prestigious summer theater program at oxford university but cold n't afford it ."
15772,i see that e secured funding through a private benefactor who turned out to be denzel washington !
15773,"oh wow , noway ! i did n't know that part of the story . how cool would that be ! washington made a good investment in the gym ho turned out slack panther , wow ."
15774,yes ! and over 2 years later chadwick thanked him in person at the premiere of black panther ? did you see the wonder woman movie ?
15775,"so cool . yes , i love wonder woman . that actress who plays there al gadot did n't even know that she was auditioning for wonder woman at the time she was doing it ."
15776,yes . i found it interesting that she served 2 years as a soldier in the israel defense forces so she kind of had ezpredience for the role .
15777,"that 's an amazing personal history not many people , e rave , relaly incredibly is gal gadot thought that day she auditioned that she was trying for catwoman . that is sort of funny . shes just tat good ."
15778,that is funny ! wonder woman is bot 'the highest grossing superhero origin movie and the highest ww1 movie too !
15779,"neat ! i never heard that fact before a i am also a huge meryl streep fan . her first film was s sport film such seems like an odd fit nut she mad but work , i guess ."
15780,i 've always liked her ! she auditioned fort he lead role in the 1976 king kong movie . the producer said she was ugly . what an insult !
15781,oh yeah and the funny part of that story is that she speaks italian fluently ! so she responded to his insult in his own language . lol
15782,right ! lol she has been nominated for an academy award 18 times !
15783,"yes , she has received 31 golden globe nominations , winning eight more nominations and sins than any other actor ."
15784,ymjsy
15785,"meryl streep 's daughter id also an actress . she plays teh fbi agent on mr . robot , grace bummer . neat 's a good legacy ."
15786,sorry i hit the enter button by accident . i did n't know that . how interesting . i seen where stanely tucci make meryl cook with him to prepare for julie and julia . neat .
15787,"yes , they spooked together to really get into character . i bet that food was incredible to snack on during the making of the film !"
15788,i would have been hungry all he time smelling that on the set ! lol i have to get running . it was nice chatting with you !
15789,have you watched black panther ?
15790,"i have n't seen i the , but i bought it to watch when i have free time . i tend to take over to get around to seeing movies , even though i 've read critics ' opinions . you ?"
15791,yeah i want to watch it though i have not found the time yet l black panther is the richest superhero so he must be pretty good .
15792,"crazy to think there 's a superhero richer than iron man . i guess thor does n't really count , since he 's a god ."
15793,"xd . tony stark is only work 100 billion , bruce wayne 80 billion while black panther is worth 500 billion ."
15794,"i wish i were ' only ; worth 100 billion . black panther basically owns a country , though , so those numbers make sense . had n't thought about batman , either ."
15795,it 's interesting taht the script in black panther is based on an actual ancient text . i thought it was just made up .
15796,i did n't know that . i don ' ithink many superhero movies sure based on source materials that old . i wonder if that makes people from the ancient text 's region feel closer to them one .
15797,speaking of cultural things marvel censored ' praise hanuman ' in indian release of black panther thinking it would be culturally insensitive wb ut indians reacted negatively as they fund that empowering rather than insulting .
15798,"that reminds me of looney toons removing speedy gonzales hte mouse , which upset people from mexico because he was a favorite character there . maybe companies should actual ; y ask the people they think they 're offending before censoring things ."
15799,"ha , you are right . when wonder woman first appeared as a member of the justice society she was the secretary . i wonder if that offended anyone ."
15800,"her allso of but could see through anyone ' slides about why they were late for appointments ! but yes , it probably did . there 's always someone looking to be offended . it causes problems when it prevents someone from being themselves , though ."
15801,"gel gadot , the new wonder woman , served two years sas a soccer in the israel defense forces . things have changed a bit !"
15802,"she sounds like a wonder woman in real life , not just the wonder woman character ! that movie was successful enough to change a lot of things , like what the highestgrossing superhero origin movie was ."
15803,it isp unit hat gal gadot did n't know she was auditioning for wonder woman n .
15804,i hear the was auditioning for catwoman . imagine trying to be a villain and ending up perfect for a superhero q
15805,"ah , so true ! and wonder woman is n't only the highest grossing superhero origin movie it is the highes grossing i movie . pretty cool ."
15806,it also seemed likd eli sordid better than most other dc movie . that franchise has n't been as successful as marvel overall .
15807,the success of wonder woman as taught hollywood that boys will happily accept a female superhero .
15808,"most people will accept anything if the surrounding movie is good enough , but wonder woman definitely paved teh way for more acceptance once they realized that the superhero 's demographic does n't define the film the effort everyone puts into the film does ."
15809,you 're right . films need to be evacuated objectively without thinking about identity politics .
15810,have you watched black ; another
15811,"hello where , no i have not seen it yet but i realy want to . how about you ?"
15812,i havent either . it must have been a good movie . black panther in the richest superhero .
15813,yeah i ca n't imagine there being super heroes more wealthy than bruce wayne an dmb . stark but i guess ther eis .
15814,apparently black panther risk worth 500 billion but tony stark is worth 100 billion and bruce wayne 80 billion .
15815,yeah see and it 's not even close !
15816,i think it 's cool that the symbols and script in the film are based on an actual script called nsibdi .
15817,"yeah that is all cool , i like when actual facts and real history are used in movies ."
15818,"put apparently they censored ' praise hanuman ' in indian releases thinking they would get backlash for a villains character praising a hind god . they thought that it was empowering , not insulting ."
15819,yeah and it 's always hard to predict how people will react to things .
15820,right . what do you think about wonder woman ?
15821,"i think it is very cool tha the movie was a big success . i think it gives young gills something ti cheer for instead of just the male superheroes , what about you ?"
15822,"yeah i think so too . gal gadot who is the new wonde roman , actually served two years as a soldier ."
15823,"haha i think i have read that before , that is impressive . i heard she was really good in that movie as well ."
15824,it ; s funny that she did not know she was auditioning for wonder woman . she though she waist being out for cat woman
15825,"that is pretty funny , do you know what year the original wonder women made an appearance ?"
15826,it 's been a long time ! i believe it was 4 1 .
15827,"good call ! yeah i gues she was originally their secretary in the justice society ,"
15828,teh success of wonder woman has taught hollywood that boys happily accept a female superhero .
15829,"exactly , and yeah the money tells lol about that , i know that movie did really well !"
15830,"movies indeed to be objectively evacuated due to their cultural fluently , nuance and contest . i guess wonder woman and blacc panther are successful in those aspects ."
15831,"hey ! it sounds crazy but there are several teenagers running or governor in kansas . of course , there are a lot of adults unhappy at that news ."
15832,"did n't even know that was legal , sorely hey have to be 18 right ?"
15833,actual ; y no . but the state legislative committee is trying to pass a bill that would make 18 the minimum age .
15834,"people are getting tired of career politicians and want something new , but then the nigh school trend started . crazy if it 6 year old would win ."
15835,"would probably govern better han trump though . governor is a pretty big job for a teenager however . they govern the executive branch of the state , ranking right under head of state . so i 'd think some age and experience would be helpful ."
15836,at least they are motivated . held their debate way before the adults running for governor .
15837,"yeah , that 's true . when arnold schwarzenegger was governor of california , he had to commute . ours everyday because he did n't actual , a live in sacramento . that 's motivation too !"
15838,just read that inmates can run for office theres do . how about governing from state prison ? think they need to take a look at the law a little closer .
15839,haha . that is truly crazy . and in kentucky politicians hve swear that they 've never participated in a duel before taking office . might be time to take a look at that la wa well .
15840,that is hilarious ! did you know justin tx voted to rename a garbage dump after fred durst ?
15841,hhaa . that 's quite fitting . leave it to austin ! astronauts can vote for space . . . wonder what kind of absentee ballot they have to fill out ?
15842,that is a very good question . space mail !
15843,"in the united kingdom , not all men could vote until 1918 ."
15844,thats strange . learn something new everyday
15845,"another strange fact : in india , they set up up a polling boot chin a lioninfested forest just so one voter could go to the polls ."
15846,"that is strange . and another , chicago is named the windy city because of the way politicians re there versus actual wind !"
15847,"too funny . speaking of big cities , new york city has no walmarts because the local unions and politicians oppose them so much ."
15848,good for nyc !
15849,"agreed . maybe we should just go to a lottery system for selecting our politicians , like they did in voice in the middle ages . they seemed to have some success with it ."
15850,"the lottery system is an interesting angle , could n't be much worse than what we 're gettin now ."
15851,been great talking to you !
15852,"do you , know much about governors ?"
15853,some things . do you know who was the one that opposed the internment of japanese americans during wii ?
15854,"yes that was ralph lawrence , can not believe he was the only one"
15855,i know right ? when texas elected their first female governor other stated did not even ave the amendment in place for it
15856,wow they were ahead o 'the game its seem seem we do not think of the s such right ?
15857,yes tey sure are . in 1934 night dakota declared martial law and decided to secede from the us
15858,wow . do you know where schwarzenegger lived when hew as cali governor ?
15859,yeah eh travelled o sacramento every day by a private jet
15860,"wow what a waste of money adn bad environmental i , pact at the same tme"
15861,yup pretty much . did you vote in the past election ?
15862,"i sure did , in india they set up a voting poll for a single guy wo lives in the forest with tigers"
15863,ww scary . astronauts actually vote from the space
15864,that is so neat . in alabama one third of the black males are not allowed to vote
15865,i think that ha it do with the felony law policy that prevents them from doing so
15866,yeah so sad . in texas on the other hand they are doing to rename the garbage dump
15867,hahha so funny . in the uk not all men could vote until 1918
15868,"i wonde what prevented them from doing , maybe class and ranking goin society"
15869,"i wonder , maybe . do you know how officials were selected to office in the middle ages in venice ?"
15870,yes that was y lottery and it worked so well for them
15871,yeah it seems so . james buchanan ad a boyfriend that the others in the office called his better half
15872,wow . did you know there isn k walmart inn y city ?
15873,yes and that is because local unions do not want the there
15874,hi how are you ? what do you know about a ?
15875,"i am well and know nothing about mars , other than it is he red planet . o you knw a lot ?"
15876,i do not know much . it is the fourth planet from the sun . it is named after the god of war .
15877,i did read that it is called the red planet because of he reddish iron oxide on its surface .
15878,"yeah , t he sunsets are different there too . , the atmosphere makes them blue . not much air on mars though ."
15879,"it has the i , pact craters of the moon and the valleys , deserts and ice caps of earth . how interesting !"
15880,"it looks like a place we could live , but i think it would take some work ."
15881,a lot with al of that thin air ! i wonder if it is actually possible .
15882,"we would need atmosphere converter , plus some source of water , which might be there . the gravity would be lower and the year would be longer ."
15883,does that mean i would be lighter on mars ?
15884,"yes , but your muscles would probably trophy too ."
15885,neat would be problematic . sound shave a higher pitch on mars then they do on earth .
15886,"yes , we would sound a bits imply on mars . but that would make life there more unbearable , i think . lol"
15887,would a colony is expected on mars by 2023 .
15888,i think that is a bit ambitious . traveling there is ah huge headache . then you get there and what ? is backup or relief coming soon ? sounds far fetched .
15889,cna you imagine being a satalite on mars ?
15890,"yeah , that was a huge mistake ep feet vs . meters . who uses feet any more ? no one . no one uses hat system ."
15891,only the us and we are soo stubborn to get rid o fit .
15892,"yeah , but for engineering and science , it seems strange to m e way , great chat !"
15893,ditto . nice chatting with you !
15894,have a great day !
15895,you too . take care .
15896,do yiu lot in a state where there is a governor ?
15897,yes i do . we just had an election for ours that was at the top of national news .
15898,"here i live the governor is mainly a symbol position representing the queen , nothing like teh usa ."
15899,governors have different powers between different political systems . schwarzenegger was a governor in ca !
15900,i must have been tough for him to learn all the political stuff to be governor .
15901,he was surely a ' star ' ! he commuted by private jet to sacramento everyday ! our politics in the us is like a sport .
15902,yeah there must a lof of money in th system when you can ask the beatles for a campaign song
15903,come together ! ! ! great song . we watched a political fight play out over the temperature . a room .
15904,"there is some debates about the ideal temperature of a room between men and women , since they typically dressed differently ."
15905,men seem to live the temperature . it goes a little deeper though than just temperature .
15906,"it goes to what is considered ' normal ' , and when is normal is driven by a masculine perspective , anything feminine becomes anoraml ."
15907,sexist if you ask me . i you know that even dry cleaners charge women more for their nothing . for the same shirt !
15908,"she same goes to haircut , razors and a lot of things ."
15909,"it seems men are considered to have the ' default ' body . but on the flip side , women are cosnideredt he ' default ' parent ."
15910,"i do n't see that as a positive , it only put more pressure on women and less pressure on men ."
15911,gender equality is a pressing issue . a ' unisex ' shirt is even cut in men 's style .
15912,"shirts have been worn by men at th start , thats hey women shirts are considered special . . but it should stop ."
15913,i suppose some progress has been more . but not enough . i am happy to see so many more women in politics .
15914,nad they are asking changes for women like cynthia nixon when she asked to raise the temperature for the primary debate .
15915,"yeah , that turned into a mic bigger debate . with half the worlds population being women , we sure do need to turn the te , premature up !"
15916,it is a long might but it has to be done . thanks for the conversation .
15917,greats once ! i 'm glad we agree on so many things .
15918,by
15919,i was reading about teens in kansas putting together a movements to run or governor to combat young voter apathy . amazing !
15920,is n't it ! they will be stopped but you have to give them a big high five for trying ! they already moved a bill recently to ban anyone under 18 from running . . . . .
15921,i love the do that they care enought o try . only 13 percent o young people ages 18 to 24 odd in the last unpresidential election in kansas .
15922,"you do have to respect them for sure ! had that is sad , all young adults and to vote ! i hope that changes next get . too many of these kids get mocked and lagged at and i hate that because if is their future !"
15923,"shame on the adults for mocking think . i think that they have already earned respect by treating the election seriously , having well thought out opinions on the issue , and organizing a forum with opposing sides represented . kudos to them !"
15924,"definitey ! in 1908 a chimp got 400 , 000 votes in a mayoral election in rio e janeiro . . . . the chimp came in and place . funny . even inmates store in the us can run so why not he kids !"
15925,absolutely . the fist k with the idea said he wanted to run to get more people involved in politics in a good way . hte future of our country depends on thinking like that !
15926,exactly ! other are some in the state capitol arent going to keep teen candidates legal so that 's a positive note !
15927,i agree . it will be interesting to see where this type of thinking leads us in the future . . .
15928,i think these kids will make some positive changes eventually they are very passionate about many issues in the government on every level
15929,yes . . . i was reading about voting . i did not realize that 34 percent of the black male population in alabama has permanently lost the right to vote . i wonder why that s ?
15930,what ? ? ? how can that be ? what are they doing living in the past . . . . that 's ridiculous see did you atheists can not be governor in south carolina ? ? ? weird
15931,"sounds like lots of odd stuff is going on in the south ! las weirdly , i read that not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918 . just for comparison , women got the right to vote in 1920 ."
15932,very interesting ! there is a brazilian proper that say . . . our country grows at night when politicians are asleep . . . . i love that !
15933,"oh , me too ! i ah not heard that ! and pretty cool that in texas , they elected their first female governor before some states had even ratified af merle 's rig to vote ."
15934,really ? that is awesome ! did you know canada first official money was factual playing boards . . . they cut them into shapes and signed by the governor . . . fun fact lol
15935,"that sounds like canada . i love the people and the country . beautiful place and fun ! hey , and in kentucky , politicians must swear an oath that they have never participated in a duel before taking office . lol !"
15936,i love canada too ! well werent ' we just discussion the south hahahaa . . . very strange !
15937,"yes , although that duel thing seems like it should have been going on out in the cowboy west in the old days ."
15938,might ? they must have kept th claws from way back i time lol
15939,lots of curious things that are fu it learn about . it has been great chatting with you . thanks !
15940,it has been great ! thank you and have a great night !
15941,do you know much about governors ?
15942,some stuff . who you know who the only one to vote againt 'the internment of japanese american during wwii is ?
15943,"yes that was ralph lawrence , can not believe he was the only one"
15944,"yes . did you know in texas hey elected a female governor , and that was ahead of many other states ?"
15945,yeah theyd didn ot even have the maendememt ratified then
15946,yeah . in north dakota the governor declared martial law in 1934
15947,yes and then they seceded fo mothe hous
15948,yeah . did you now schwarzenegger did not live in sacramento when he was a governor ?
15949,yeah he commuted by a private jet everyday
15950,yeah what a waste . die you vote last time ?
15951,i did . do you know how officials were elected in ancient venice ?
15952,"i have no idea , how ? did you knw astronauts vote from space ?"
15953,that i so cool and in venice they used to be elected ? lottery
15954,wow cool . in the uk not all men were allowed to vote until 1918
15955,hmm i wonder what restrictions were in place that to prevent them
15956,no idea . in al ; alabama sadly one third of black males are not allowed to vote
15957,"yeah and that is a permanent ban , they lost the right"
15958,yeahsad . in austin texas people so to be busy voting for other things
15959,yeah they really want to vote on renaming the garbage dump fred durst
15960,hhaa people are really very different sometimes . do you know how officials were elected in venice in the ancient times ?
15961,yes that was all by lottery and it worked well
15962,hav eyou heard about the teenagers running for governor i kansas ?
15963,"yeah , so they need forward a bill that ba people from running for office who were under 18 , k crazy ."
15964,"that is kind of crazy , but good for those kids to show initiative . maybe it can inspire younger voters to get out and vote ."
15965,"yeah , voting i too important . in india the government se til a polling both in a forest filled with lions and for just one voter ."
15966,"that 's really cool . i did n't know this , but astronauts are able to vote from space ."
15967,"that 's awesome e ! in austin , texas l , people voted to rename their trash dump after limp bizkit frontman fred durst . haha ."
15968,i agree with that sentiment that limp bizkit was not great .
15969,"haha . amen . in the url , nyt to men had the right to vote until 1918 ."
15970,that 's crazy . i makes me sad that 34 percent of the black male population i my state has permanently one the right to vote .
15971,"that is sad . and insane . every citizen shoudl have the right to vote imo . in texas , they elected their first female governor before some states had even given women the right to vote ."
15972,"i agree , it should be a basic right what nobody should lose . that 's awesome for texas ."
15973,i also read somewhere ethan the beatles ' song ' come together was written for timothy leary 's 1969 campaign for governor of california . do knew ?
15974,that 's a fitting song i guess . i 've hear speculation that james buchanan might have been our first and only gay presidnet . he had a boyfriend whom the politicians referred to as ' his better half . '
15975,"very interesting . good for him . in kentucky politicians have to swear an oath tat they 've never bee nine a duel before they 're allowed to take office . maybe a law that 's needs to be updated , eh ?"
15976,that does need to be updated ! they say that chicago got btw ' nickname ' the windy city ' after the boastful loquacity of its politicians rather than the actual guest of wind that shoot between buildings .
15977,i can see that . there are no walmarts in new york city because thiel vocal politicians nad unions do n't want one . maybe the only place in the us that does n't have . haha .
15978,i could n't imagine that at all . there 's a walmart on almost every corner where i live .
15979,"same . when arnold schwarzenegger was governor , he had to fly to sacramento every day by private jet because he did not live there ."
15980,i 'm surprised he did n't take a helicopter . everyday he could say ' get to the chopper ! '
15981,hahahaha ! perfect . north dakota 's governor declared martial law adn secured from the us in 1934 .
15982,oh wow that 's pretty crazy .
15983,are you into the marvel films ?
15984,yeah definitely ! i love avengers infinity war although som people refer tp it as an abusive family which i find odd .
15985,lol that is kind of funny and i can kind of see that . i felt taht movie was great and ca n't wait for the finale end game
15986,yes it 's going to be epic ! thanos played by josh brolin is such s brutal character .
15987,"forms he , so thrilling when he is on screen . avengers created a notable increase in shawarma sales after its release"
15988,that is interesting why is that ? because thanos is a greek name ?
15989,i would think that is they . did you ever read the marvel comics growing up ?
15990,yes sometime si did . the marvel branding began back in 1961 ?
15991,"wow neat was a while ago ! good thing sony did n't buy the rights to all the characters in 1998 , i think things would hav bee indifferent"
15992,yeah that would 've change things for sure . and only for 25 million dollars . surprising .
15993,"might , i wonder how much disney bought it for a few years back . i did hear disney didn ' get complete rights to some of the characters"
15994,yes you are correct . they do n't own the rights to show in marvel characters at theme parks east of the mississippi .
15995,"i wonder how taht is , that is interesting for sure . stan lee will be missed for sure . did you ever hear about the superhero named blue ear ."
15996,yes stan lee may he rest in peace . blue ear was created for a fouryearold boy he did n't want to wear hearing aids . that is really cool .
15997,"that is so cool , i wonder if there are other created superheros like that"
15998,a i 'm not sure . marvel successfully argued in court that mutants ar not people and it got pay a lower rate on xmen toys . pretty funny . and smart .
15999,what is awesome lean agreat marketing even lol . were you into the guardians of the galaxy movies ?
16000,yes chris pratt is one of my favorite actors . games guns did amen incredible job of directing it .
16001,"i agree , i watched the first one so many uses . it was different and very appealing to all senses . did you ever hear waht the china version was translated to ?"
16002,o yeh tinny you should ask . interplanetary unusual attack team . h aha that is hilarious .
16003,"that is so accurate lol . i like it , it rolls off the tongue lol ! it was so nice chatting with you , enjoy your day !"
16004,have you seen the movie avengers ? it 's an interesting flick
16005,i have not . my daughter says i should . what cna ou tell me about it ?
16006,"there is a very controversial scene , where the adopted , brutalized daughter of the titan is going to reveal a secret to stop him from touring her sister ."
16007,sounds abusive o me . is this supposed to make em interested ?
16008,he had to sacrifice something he loves to recover the stone . he sacrifices his daughter for the stone
16009,"bad choice if you so me . like , how many of these marvel movies are there anyway ? i luke many of the actors , such as cumberbatch , buffalo , mohansson , but i am way behind o storyline detail sand i fear soo many movies have passed to allow me to catch up . . ."
16010,ther more a lot of them . i like the guardians gov the galaxy ones ut i have not seen volume 2
16011,yeah . i was to watch those too . il ike chris pratt . i am also a hulk fan . . . ferrigno
16012,yes the original hulk was great ! marvel has been around forever it started in 1939 !
16013,"ok . someone told me that the avengers caused an increase in shawarma sales , b ut what the heck is a shawarma ?"
16014,i do not have ac like . i do think its funny that the voice actor for jarvis ahs never actually seen the movie
16015,yeah . i heard tht there was a very popping line in gg ? do you know what that was ?
16016,no i do not recall it . i know that groot first appeared in 1959 however .
16017,"i heard that it diesel plays groot int he film , and they wrote a separate script for him to help give him a clue about voice infection for one of his lines ."
16018,yes i can see it diesel struggling with that . i think its funny that in china they were referred to as a interplanetary unusual attack team !
16019,goat love it . i hear sony wash offered hte right to marvel characters for a mere 25 million and they balked . epic fail .
16020,absolutely ! they thought that spiderman was the only superhero anyone woud ever care about ? had they never met a geek ?
16021,right ? can anyone say ' comic con ? ' b ut sony is not the only studio with questionable ideas on this . disney is n't own the rights to many of them are characters for theme parks east of the mississippi . orlando is east of the mississippi !
16022,wow that is pretty nuts disney world is a huge park ! it is funny the is one character named access who is owed by both marvel and dc two 's only purpose is to keep the companies universes apart
16023,"a sad reason to exist . i well , at least we get to watch it unfold . avengers : infinity war was teh first movie to be filmed entirely using imax digital cameras , so it should make for a spectacular show !"
16024,yes and they are good folks in general they even made a superhero for a 4 year old who wore hearing aids just so he could related !

16041,"yes , a ; apparantly by the early 50 's they had generally become atlas comics and hte marvel branding began in the 60s . . . it gone through its own evolution ."
16042,"that 's crazy . i did read that there is a shared hero , access , between marvel and dc tho keep the two seperate . inventive !"
16043,"that is ! hes tiny are so successful , as an outsider its cool to see the growth but im sure from their point it was a challenge and they fought through until reaching success . . . give e hope : ,"
16044,agreed . i always feel bad for those who choose a side . ie enjoy both sides so i wo n't choose .
16045,"im happy to be in the middle too , i cant choose . although funk act . . . did you know in diesel played groot ? i think only in one of the moves but still , ad no idea !"

16049,"i have not . i usually dont watch superhero films . to many specials effects , not enough story for me . i did like spiderman 2 ."
16050,"oh ok , that was a good movie . avengers infinity war is the first film shot entirely in digital imax cameras ."
16051,that is great ! i think the technical innovation will make the theater experience so much better .
16052,the avengers movies caused a increase in shawarma sales lol
16053,what ? ? that is funny . the kids saw it in the movie and decided they wanted to eat it ? lol

16057,i like spiderman . i dont kno wthe films . i heard guardians was pretty funny though .
16058,"yeah it was hilarious ! ! spiderman is cool too ,"
16059,"ok , there was a sequel to guardians too . was that funny ?"

16071,i listen to everything . lol viktor job kept his job in the boiler room of his apartment even after becoming the biggest rock star in russian history !
16072,"wow , that 's pretty good dedication do work ! i 've heard restaurants with loud rock type music can make patrons choose burgers over salad . what do you think about that theory ?"
16073,lol i think that 's pretty interesting ! for some reason i can see it . i ca n't explain it though . the state of song of oklahoma is ' do you realize ? ' b y the flaming lps .
16074,"wow , that 's an interesting pick of songs , it 's much more modern of ay rock songs than i 'd imagine . i 've been in coffee house there they play both rock and jazz . it 's nice . have you ?"
16075,"i have n't been in coffee shops , but where i live thee is a lot of wineries and they have live rock had jazz bands there . so i n relate ! we 're you ever a fan of whitesnake ?"
16076,"not a huge fan , but i have heard their stiff . not bad . what about you ? i really like led zeppelin , but i guess i 'm not alone ."
16077,i like led zeppelin . be nice it they did a reunion before it 's too late . whitesnake has had 50 members throughout their history ! lol
16078,"ww , that 's a lot of members . it would be hard for a fan of keep track of them all ! i guess rock music is n't always god in restaurants . . . mario natalie 's always played it and how he 's got a lawsuit on his hands ."
16079,wow . i did n't know that . a hanson song became a most requested track on a hcicagoa altrock radio station because he djs did not reveal the name of the band . lol
16080,"meant to say now he 's got a lawsuit , not how , lol . that 's funny about hanson ! did you know sweetgreen is a salad restaurant chain that used to have a music festival ? have you eaten there ?"
16081,invent ever heard of that place . lol do you have any other details about it ?
16082,"only tha tit as sort of like fresh choice restaurants , and i have been there . did you know some places play rock or other music so loud it can be a hazard for the people that work there ? scary ."
16083,i can believe that ! the led zeppelin song ' black dog ' i shamed after a black lab that was wandering around the recording studio and doe n't have any real relation lo the song itself a that 's interesting !
16084,i think it 's funny how place spare correlation loud rock music to eating pretty much junk food my restaurants . as if all people who like rock also ike junk food ? lol
16085,right ? lol led zeppelin let bey affleck use ' wen the levee breaks ' in argo wit condition he digitally alter the player 's needle drop to a correct spot on the record .
16086,i realy like how jack bank got the rights to all zeppelin 's ' immigrant any ' or the school of rock music . it was a creative way with 1000 finals backing him .
16087,i liked that movie . cool . jazz trumpeters grew goatees as it provided comfort when playing . hmmm . . . . that ' different . it 's been fun chatting with you !
16088,"wow , neat 's pretty funny ! i ad an ex in a jazz band and he played the tromb0ne . he said n't have a quirk like that , only bad jokes along with the gandmates ! lol cya !"
16089,lol nice ! have a good one !
16090,did you hear about how music can influence your food choices in a restaurant .
16091,"yes , i heard about that ! too funny , i guess louder music amps you p and people them to eat bad foods lol"
16092,i thik i need to start either wearing ear plugs or eating prices with no music . lol
16093,"hahahaa ! you and me both . i guess restaurant owners have known this for a long time , i guess it gets people to order more food too ."
16094,"yesh , probably includes dessert too um music does really create a vibe ."
16095,"yes , it does ! i read that if they play rock music , like maybe led zeppelin . . . the customers seem to order a lot of burgers with cheese and fries along with a few beers ; lol"
16096,"even side salad are not even ordered , but bacon jam instead with th music louder ."
16097,"hhaha , that 's so interesting . i guess when they play jazz music , people tend to make good choices nad rider food that is good for them . i guess it makes all decision making asia . . . i better start listening to jaz more hahaaa"
16098,for real . i might try the trick while shopping . maybe ill make better food choices in these tore .
16099,"exactly ! actually they say some supermarekts use teh , usmc in teh same way , more upbeat or ambient ; . . it makes a difference e ."
16100,"ive been to place with loud live music , it almost made me want to leave , but i did also want to drive more . that is really crazy to think ho what works ."
16101,"it is interesting , i guess when you go out to a place to have trunks and listen to a live band it 's always so loud and it does amp you up ."
16102,did you know taht led zeppelin helped to fund monty python and the holy grail ?
16103,"what ? that is cool . i love monty python and led zeppelin n ,"
16104,pink floyd and geens9s were in n it too .
16105,"2 more great bands ! the led zeppelin song black dog . . . was named that because of a black a that had been running around the studio , lol . . . they did n't even know theyd og ."
16106,wow . crazy way to get a name for a band .
16107,"i agree , lol i guess it worked out well though . so many great older rock bands , and it is crazy they are still around . like the th band whitesnake , through hte years had 50 band members ! wow . . ."
16108,wow . did you know sony the hedgehog was supposed to be a member of a rock band initially ?
16109,yes ! and sonic was supposed to have a blond haired girlfriend named madonna ! haha
16110,great chat ! have a did night !
16111,its interesting how loud musics a shave a influence over your choices
16112,"wow , i had no idea !"
16113,yeah apparently you are more likely to odder a burger instead of a salad in a place with loud music !
16114,i will need to start listening to softer music then . my belly does not need more burgers !
16115,"i agree with you there lol , its amazing how music influence simple decisions nad con lift the sales of a store , music sure thas a deep power ."
16116,i do read on music when i am at the gym . i really need something upbeat and loud when i am lifting . i can listen to podcasts when i am doing cardio !
16117,do yiu like any genre in particular ? i sure love rock music
16118,i like rock and dirty rock . i can throw in rap and alt rock too . classic rock too .
16119,do you kno wthe rockband the whitesnake ?
16120,"i do , yes . why do you ask ?"
16121,so aparently th band has so many members that the list needed its own wikipedia page .
16122,ha ! that 's really funny . the state rock song of ok is by the flaming lips !
16123,do you like the band led zeppelin ?
16124,i do like them . do you ?
16125,"i do like them , there are , any interesting fact about the band like how the song black dog is named after a labrador taht happened to be at the studio at the right time and date ."
16126,i ponder if sonic the hedgehog was supposed to ge a member of that band . he was supposed to have a girlfriend too !
16127,"i guess he did pretty good . a dog lol , his girlfriend was named madonna so that is a lucky dog"
16128,i wonder if he likes jazz ?
16129,"he might , jazz is a genre that has influence a lot of people so who knows , there oven a programming language that s influenced by jazz"
16130,it is seen as americans classical music . i love jazz .
16131,"i love it too , you know that jazz trumpeters actually grow goatees because or th comfort they bring q"
16132,interestin that people tend to order something 'no good ' for them like a huge at a noise restaurant !
16133,yeah maybe because loud noise makes them anxious and greasy food is comforting ? no wonder restaurant owners are so concerned with creating the right atmosphere !
16134,of hire a band when you have too much extra meat !
16135,"haha yes . and also no surprise that a the lucky bunk restaurant in washington , the no bun or lecture option for the burger is not a top seller !"
16136,that place actually sounds pretty good . the us screaming must bleeds right in !
16137,yeah would be a good place to tale kids for sure . i would find it a bit distracting if they played loud rock music . the classics mock version from the 1960 's would n't be bad though .
16138,"yea , they should play one led zeppelin , been around since 1968 ."
16139,i would definitely be down with that . i think it 's funny that hanson song became a most requested rack on a chicago altrock station because the dj 's did n't reveal hey and !
16140,"that 's funny , and awful a whitesnake has apparently had 50 plus members i their urban over the ears"
16141,hard to believe . i saw some pretty good jazz in new orleans once . fan n't a huge fan but it is definitely popular . apparently the trumpet players grow a goatee for comfort when playing .
16142,interesting . i also see that clint eastwood is an enthusiasm .
16143,i had no idea it as popular in pakistan given that their jazz orchestra is topping the charts .
16144,appartently jack black made a video of himself with danes begging him to sing the immigrant song
16145,"i have actually never heard tha song ! but his band tenacious d is pretty funny . also sonic the hedgehog was suppose to be a member of a rock band and have a long haired humans . , friend named madonna . rock is definitely out there ."
16146,i wonder what sonic would play ?
16147,i am thinking either the electric guitar or drums . led zeppelin is definitely one of the biggest rock bands though . one of the best selling music artists in history .
16148,they even helped fund the monty python and thy holy grail movie
16149,that realy shows how much of an impact they have . and the think that they were initially unpopular with critics . . .
16150,yet absolutely hilarious !
16151,this conversation makes me want to go to ar restaurant with led zeppelin and order a big cheeseburgers !
16152,lets go !
16153,"hi , did you read the harry potter books or se he movies ?"
16154,i saw a couple of the movies . how abou thou ?
16155,yeah i saw the first he too . the guy who plays malfoy tried to steal the band from the set
16156,"well , that sounds like a malfoy like thing to do ! he was staying in character ."
16157,hahah that is very true . too bad he was caught
16158,spielberg wanted t made harry potter as na animated movie . seems like an odd choice . he does n't really do much animation .
16159,yeah 9 have never heard him do animations . do you know the reward daniel got for winning the role of harry '
16160,"um , a job ? i do n't know . what did he get ?"
16161,was slowed to stay up and watch fault towers
16162,terry william was rowling 's first choice tp direct the first movie . a monty python guy ? i guess it could work for a child 's film . fault towers had a monty python alum .
16163,there was an unauthorized segue line china with hobbit characters with harry potter names
16164,china seems to have an unauthorized everything these days . maybe even monty python . perhaps unauthorized chinese stephen fry did the narration .
16165,"haha maybe , yeah seems like it . do you like johnny depp ?"
16166,"we do n't really get along . he has a different artistic vision , so awe partied ways ."
16167,i did not know he directed the film 'the brave '
16168,is that the film about some native person ?
16169,yes that is it . nad he seems to be working on a movie about dr . seuss

16171,yeah me too . have you ever edward scissorhands ?
16172,"yes , i saw it my years ago . i thought the casting was perfect , though it was an odd tall ."
16173,yes it was pretty odd . apparently depp only said 196 word in the entire film
16174,"pain by that word , as i suspected . these stars have their demands ."
16175,"yup , for sure . nice chatting with you : ,"
16176,free you a fan of johnny depp ?
16177,"yeah , i like some of the roles he 's played . seems like when he team up weigh tim burton it 's always a good combination for instance . how about you ?"
16178,i thought he was a in 21 jump street .
16179,"oh , wow , you 're waaay back . haven ' y thought of that tv selfies in awhile ! lo , i think it awesome of him how he adopted the one eyed horse he used in sleepy hollow after hearing it was going to be at down ."
16180,"i think richard geico replaced him on it , right ?"
16181,"im not sure . . . i know geico had his own tv series after a bit , looker , b ut dunno if he replace depp on that show for awhile or what . it 's been too long , my memory 's all fuzzy . ."
16182,oh yeah ! i forgot about that . hilarious . did you know johnny depp only says 196 words in edwards scissorhands ?
16183,"no , i did n't kno waht . although i door till his character not being the most talkactive flow in stat firm . speaking of keep , i heard he 's working on a biopic of dr seuss . that should be interesting to watch ! i fit comes out . . ."
16184,"hmmm , that sounds interesting . what about fantasy , do you like that genre ?"
16185,"o , i like fantasy ! used go play and a bit but kin the day , still only , if i knew of ay local groups that were open . , but it 's a just that , i 'm told some people fantasy draft the national spelling bee . donate sk me how tat works ."
16186,i think htey just pick a bunch of kids that they think will win ?
16187,tha tight work . i 'm not the also have a fantasy congress . . . what do you think of that one e ?
16188,sounds even more boring l lol
16189,i 'd like af fantasy congress that does n't waste huge amounts of tax payer money and does what 's best for the country . that would be a real fantasy .
16190,"yup , that will never happen . did you know a single fold in the brain makes the difference between fantasy and reality ?"
16191,"that 's pretty neat . i know some people that i think have that fold missing ! so , how about you ? you like fantasy much ?"
16192,not too much the most of the shows that i watch go on for too dont and i lose interest .
16193,"speaking of long , hero was a janitor tthat wrote a 15 , 145 page fantasy manuscript called in the realms of the unreal . it 's actually a fascinating story , i saw a documentary on it on youtube !"
16194,"interesting . it people like it ? well , nice chatting i you !"
16195,"it 's kind of popular among artist , at least , the parts that haven he published . no one 's been able to gather the whole thing . anyway , good talking to yiu as well !"

16197,do you like tube fantastic beasts movies ?
16198,"i i , although i have no seen the newest one . have you seen them ?"
16199,"yes , , the us fantastic beats ' sequel goes surprisingly dark , wish a shocking reveal at the end"
16200,rally ! i guess the first one was a little dark too . i feel like th harry potter movies went from pretty light and tame to pretty dark . i 'm rewatching with my son . . .
16201,"that 's cool . you a not want him tos . this one yet . as te film opens , the title character , an evil wizard played by johnny depp , is seen escaping from retention"
16202,"i may need to see it for emmy son does . he 's 7 and i worry about the later hp movies . we 're dragging our feet on movie 3 because f that too . speaking of ho , jason isaac who played julius malfoy in the harry potter films was fight trying to steal his wand from the set"
16203,"i loved him in star trek . d you know that a sa reward for winning the part of harry potter , daniel radcliffe was allowed to stay up and watch fault towers"
16204,"as a reward for winning the part of harry potter , daniel radcliffe was allowed to play up and watch fault towers"
16205,"production took place over the years , so at the end he would watch whatever he wanted !"
16206,an unauthorized harry potter sequel was sold in china consisting of ' the hobbit ' with hte names changed to harry potter characters ! who knew !
16207,"i hear that he main character of ' troll ' was named harry potter , back kin 1986 !"
16208,what ! t hat 's crazy !
16209,"they will ever get johnny depp , has won the golden globe and screen actors guild awards for best actor in one of those knockoffs !"
16210,"in the harry potter universe , hogwarts is located in scotland , not england . id id not know that ."
16211,"well , it is the third highestgrossing film series with 7 . 7 billion in worldwide receives so the can do as they wish !"
16212,johnny depp directed the 1997 film 'the brave '
16213,quite a leap after depp rose to prominence on the 1980s television series 241 jump street
16214,"johnny depp is prodjucun grand possibly starring in a biopic about the life of theodore gisele , aka dr . seuss . weird , shih ?"
16215,"well , hopefully he will have more dialogue than in his past films . johnny depp only said 196 words in edward scissorhands"
16216,reilly ! that 's crazy ? gene wilder refused to watch the 2005 rake of willy wonka because he did n't want to be disappointed in johnny depp
16217,that ; 's cool . comedic fantasy author terry pratchett was knighted for his ' services to literature ' . neither depp r wi ; ever has that honor .
16218,people fantasy draft the national spelling bee . i turned it into a drinking game .
16219,"good do you . not quite like a janitor rom chicago who wrote over six years a 15 , 145page fantasy manuscript"
16220,what is your overall impression of the harry potter series ?
16221,"it is very exciting , great for kids an adults , what the you think ?"
16222,i also think that . is exciting and believe that a gret amount of on has gone into getting the series where it should eb .
16223,five of the series ' eight films are among the 50 highestgrossing films of all time ! taht 's incredible .
16224,taht is true . it is also interesting to note that it is the third highestgrossing film series with 7 . 7 billion in worldwide deceit s .
16225,"wow , i ses that she boy tthat played malfoy was caught trying to steal he wand he used on set ."
16226,"wow , i do n't lee any professionalism min his actions . o wonder if they brought him back after that ."
16227,"it does n't say if it was after production was over or if it was the at the beginning . i also believe that author j . k . rowling , lived in her car when writing these books before they were movies ."
16228,"yeah , i have heard of similar stories , of individual struggles before they hi 'the big league ."
16229,"one other star is tyler perry who plays made i balls of those movies . i love the whole harry potter series , it 's my favorite ."
16230,interesting i di n't know tyler perry played in harry potter movies .
16231,"eh did n't , but he was homeless sliding in his car when he first started writing for his movies , sorry for the confusion !"
16232,"oh , i see l what do you think about johnny depp as an actor ?"
16233,"he is very versatile , he can play so many different types of characters , he 's been talented ."
16234,"i agree , he is a very talented individual . i think his pirates of the caribbean series also made a significant amount of money ? . what todo you stink ?"
16235,"yes it did make a sizable amount of money . i like the pirates of the caribbean movie series and i like au chocolate , the movie he filmed in another country ."
16236,"wow , yes i hav seen pants of that movie ."
16237,"do you remember the movie , what 's eating gilbert ran ? he played in it with leonardo de caprio ?"
16238,"no , sorry i do not remember that particular movie ."
16239,"int was his first movie , i think . it was not wa very good movie , so you did n't miss much ! lol"
16240,"i think that movie that have a fantasy theme to them , make a lot of money on the box office ."
16241,"i do n't personally like fantasy themed movie o books , do you ?"
16242,i 'm not too particular when it comes to genre . as long as i thas a good story line .
16243,"you have a good point , i see that fantasy author terry pratchett was actually knighted for is services to literature , that 's is special !"
16244,true
16245,"i 've never seen jurassic world so i get the criticism that it 's a departure from the message of the original jurassic park , b ut i 'd still like to see it ."
16246,i see . what is the departure from the message so the original ?
16247,"the original was that nature could n't be controlled , and tha thurman attempts to do seo would have unintended consequences . apparently jurassic world abandon that ."
16248,"ah . well for a movie about dinosaurs , for the dinosaurs to only be in the movie for 15 minutes seems like not a very goo idea ."
16249,agreed . id also like to see an updated version of jurassic park with featheded dinosaurs . t . pet as a gift enraged fighting cock would b amazing .
16250,"well considering derek onlly and colin trevorrow are writing and steven spielberg is still executive producing , i highly doubt your dream will come to fruit n ."
16251,"yeah , that feathers dinosaur thing turns a lot of people off . i 've ever seen westworld either have you ?"
16252,"yes , i think it pretty good evan rachel wood ho plays doors in the show is fantastic . there are som real subplot going on the entire time , i recommend it ."
16253,i 'll have to check it out . i vaguely recall seeing the old west world movie with yule brynn when i was a kid .
16254,"well the theme is sort of this , mankind has the technology but not the wisdom to not use it because it is going used fo destructive purposes ."
16255,"yeah , apparently jurassic world is a departure from that , but i 'd have to see it myself to actually say ."
16256,"if you want to watch something that sticks with michael crichton'sm message from the source books , try ' prey ' or ' next ' . they both focus on hte potentially bad side of technology ."
16257,"yeah , those are definitely both things i should check out . there was an actual recent similar to the prey scenario involving a genetically engineers root bacteria that might hav eventually spread and destroyed most plant life on earth ."
16258,"so i wonder how hot the raptors suits were in jurassic park . i thought it was al computer generated , shows what i know ."
16259,"yeah , i ' m amazed . i would have rave had any idea . i just assumed they were cgi like the big ones ."
16260,i do know the raptors on the jurassic park ride are robotic for sure . it is a pretty fun experience . it cost twice as much as the movie to make with is hilarious .
16261,if i was a little kid i 'd love that ride .
16262,"the three on the other hand in the movie as cgi , it apparently took like 6 hours to render one frame back then . computers have come a long way fo sure ."
16263,i can remember how realistic it looker when i first watched the movie .
16264,"logan as chris pratt is not in it , its a good movie . not a fan ."
16265,i 'm not familiar with him .
16266,"wow , that is unfortunate that the creator of tetris did joe get amy loyalties from the game ."
16267,"yeah , alex pajitnov did n't get any money for creating tetris a game so famous that most people who are n't gamers have still heard ot it ."
16268,"yeah , even though tetris was invented way back in 1984 , it is still super popular today . it 9s one of the 3 highest selling games of all time"
16269,"yeah , that 's why there 's abou ta billion versions of the game on many different game consoles . i recently heard of some knew version called tetris effect ."
16270,that is the game on playstation vr . i bet it ks even more addictive than the original
16271,"yeah , i 've heard about that vr stuff . it thought they 'd go the route of 3d movies but 've been told vr games ar actually good . i 'm curious what vr would add to something like this , though ."
16272,it adds a more immersive feel to the game . it amplifier the experience in almost a medatative way
16273,really ? sounds interestin go i might have to try that . i wonder if that would also signify the tetris effect of helping people with ptsd .
16274,it is actually proven scientifically to aid the recovers of people dealing with trauma ay so ptsd suffers would benefit .
16275,what do you think of the zones mode they put into tetris effect ? do you think it adds a cool new mechanic into a classic game or do you think thet 're fixing what is n't broke ?
16276,"i am more old school in my gaming , so i would prefer 5o classic version , but i cna see how some would like the one mechanic"
16277,"yeah , whe it think of tetris , i think of when i wa sa kid with my gameboy trying to pass time until i could get some o the nes . it will feel a bit off playing tetris on my playstation 4 , though it might be just my warm fuzzy nostalgia ."
16278,"heck i still have my old ps2 . it is the most popular sites of all time , with over 150 million units sold"
16279,"i wish i still had my he , sadly it broke when i fell off the entertainment centre . though i have one o 'the old ps3s that can play ps2 games . you know , the department of defense used 1760 ps3s and made a super computer out of hem to save money , hahaha !"
16280,"wow . i used to have a playstation portable , but i have n't tried the newer ps visas ."
16281,"yeah , i hear the vita 's pretty good , but i did n't sell well against its rival the nintendo 3ds . still , most playstation products sold very well ."
16282,"oh yeah , the ps4 sold 1 million king the first day it was out ."
16283,wow ! and ps3s are bring used to research black holes . it 's pretty impressive what htey can get playstations to do .
16284,i gyess they really mean that ' greatness waits ' slogan taht they use on tv commercials .
16285,"mabye so . i guess greatness waited tetris as welp . tetris on playstation , perhaps it will be a great game ."
16286,maye i ca nurse my ps4 to do my own balck hole research . i would be more productive than playing 'grand thefts unto
16287,maye you can . i wonder if the newer gran theft auto games have the soundtrack on te disc like the original on is did .
16288,i would doubt it . they probably realize that most people do not even have cd players anymore
16289,"actually , try sticking a cd into a dv door bluray players . most of them can still play cds !"
16290,"really , good to know . i normally o n't even use discs . i get most of my games from the playstation store"
16291,"yeah , changing discs is a hassle wand the playstation store is more convenient . tough it is funny to use a ps4 as a cd player , hahaha ."
16292,"quite a versatile machine , from a cd payer to a government super computer"
16293,"yeah , very impressive . tsa also strange that fifa 14 was om ps2 , ps rand ps4 ."
16294,i would imagine that the graphics here very different between the 3 different versions .
16295,"yeah , i wonder if it way the same game just with different graphics o if tbh better versions got more features . that would 've confused the heck outta me , having 3 versions of the game game ?"
16296,i can imagine it was probably 3 different games with different features .
16297,"yeah , the ps3 and ps4 versions were probably better ' . it would be annoying fo buy the game for a feature you wanted , only to find out you bough the wrong one ."
16298,"just like any technology , ther will always be something bigger and better out ther . with the ps4 being released in 2018 , there is only a matter of time before the 5th version is out"
16299,"hear , i wonder what kind of tetris they can put on the us . mabye holoeck tetris or something , ahha ."
16300,it is probably just going to be a chip they put into your brain
16301,"yeah , most likely . that would be some amazing v , though right in your can . they better not put an unlock code for your brain like they di for the ps3 , though ."
16302,"i can see it now , massive data breach and all ps3 owners banks accounts are wiped out"
16303,do you like movie s ? di doyou watch the latest jurassic park movie ?
16304,no . who is the man actor ?
16305,"it has several grea tractor on of them is chris last , the movie dead a cost of 101 million"
16306,is chris past in the latest jurassic park ?
16307,"and he is , he is the leading actor is fact , i think it 's a great sequel , although the dinosaurs appear for just a few minutes"
16308,but it was about the dinosaurs .
16309,"yeah butt hey didnt appear much in the movie , another interesting fact is how raptors were generated , you would think they were made by com ; users but no"
16310,the last jurassic was not directed by spielberg . is i was good st he firs one ?
16311,"o , it was directed by j . a bacon , im not familieared with has work but the move was ok so im guessing he has the talent"
16312,spielberg was still involved so it must have been good .
16313,"i agree spielberg is a great director , you know tat it took 6 hours to render a part pf the trey in jurassic park , s rounds expensive ."
16314,it does sound expensive . i need to watch teh fallen kingdom .
16315,you do ! its a good movie and you wont regret watching it
16316,is pratt a good actor ?
16317,"he is a food actor he is also one of the leading actors o guardians of the galaxy , so yeah i like him"
16318,he used the live in a van in hawaii .
16319,"he did , i bet he had it really hard , he was actually a faster at a bubble gump shrimp restaurant and he got scouted , thats a real , lol lucky break"
16320,"yes , he was lucky because there are a lot of good talents out there ."
16321,"i agree , he joked about having the red role on jurassic par and i guess his joke became a reality !"
16322,spielberg might have read his comment .
16323,"i think hed id or maybe he just like this role on guardians of the galaxy , you know he stole the costume of the movie so eh could visit sick children at hospitals"
16324,"i think you are right ; a way , nice chatting with you ."
16325,"hi , how are you ?"
16326,hello . 9 'm alright . how are you ?
16327,i am great . i am just watching some golden state baseketball . do you like then a ?
16328,not really . i 'm sure into tablets games and video games that sort . i 'm especially goo dat tetris .
16329,nice ! i used to play tetris all the time and was terrible at it . i tried so hard and got no where . if lot like a huge tetris failure and the harder i tried the more pressure and the more failure .
16330,"really ? i find it relaxing . something about the music and the repetitiveness , i guess . but i suppose it can make me a little anxious when it gets really fast and or o really close to the top . or if i mess up ."
16331,"oh my lord , when it spread up i got so anxious and you coudl basically bet i was going to lose winwin a few pieces . he other day i was thinking about spy hunter . did you ever play that game ?"
16332,"i 'm not familiar with that one . is it new ? appartently i rid to get a ps4 , b because there 's a new version of tetris tetris effect . what kind of a game is spy hunter ?"
16333,"spy hunter was an old school , like commodore 64 , game . i do n't remember the system but i remember loving it . it was so big . you drove a carb nd had to out run the cops . you had oil slicks and mis , se to get away . i was bad at that no but it was fun . i guess i am not good a video lame . . ."
16334,"oh that 's coo to i used to work at a game store , so i have several oldschool systems , including an atari . we had a commodore 64 in the store once , and i should ' ; ve bought it when i had the chance . sadly , i 've never gotten to pa ; y one . i 'm not very good at video games either . i guess i 'm more of a collector than a serious gamer . they 're a good way to relax when i have time . also , i just found out that apparently playing tetris can help people with addictions . i 'm going to share that information with my roommate , who 's a smoker . unfortunately , i ca n't bring my gem boy to work , so ut probably ca n't help with my soda addiction ."
16335,"that 's ok , at least i 's not smoking . i have a coffee addiction si we 're in the same boat . i had 4 cups today and i am dragging gf what eels to you do for fun ?"
16336,"i 've got a ton of nerdy hobbies . i 'm a star wars costumer i note 50s region , for starters . i ' also a historical reenact . i also enjoy geocaching and running . how about you ?"
16337,"i have a full time job , teach college , have two , i a wife , and do a lot of hits . i do not have a lot of time . i was up at 4 to go to the by 4 : 30 . i lift until 6 : 30 so i guess that is my free time ."
16338,"dang . i am not a morning person . i get up for work at 7 . i might get up earlier than tht for something i really want to do like catching a plane pr saving daylight for a long reaching trip but usually i prefer to sleep in . i also have a full time job , and a side gig , but i 'm still single . i do have two roommates and a cat . my hobbies take uo a lot of time , which is hey playing video games is usually at the bottom , m of the list ."
16339,"walking up a 40 was tough when i first started but now , it 's second nature . it 's really a great option for me because i have no time to do it other wise . its so relaxing and clears my mind ."
16340,i guess i could do it as long as i went to be heard enough . typically i do n't go to bed until around midnight .
16341,i go to be at 8 . i thought about it and i usually do nothing from 8 midnight so i just cut out the tv nd went to bed . it makes sense for me . maybe go to the gym at night ? mu gym is open 24 od 7 and i am not proud to sag that i have been tear t 11 pm on a friday !
16342,"i 've pretty much already cut out tv . i do n't pay for cable ; i pretty much just hatch stuff online or buy dvds . i go running some evenings . i 'm part of a local running group , . ur current schedule is saturdays bt 9 am and tuesday at 6 pm . i ' v never really gone to the gym for anything . i think i 'd like to try ome strength training , but i do n't know how to use any of the equipment , and i ca n't afford a personal trainer , so it 's pretty intimidating ."
16343,do n't b intimidated . i 'm sure you can figure it out . i usually just fake it until i figure it out .
16344,"fair enough . with my running group , our contra is no matter how awe 're doing , were ; ready going better than everyone whos ' still on the couch . i 'm not fast by any means i doubt i 'll ever wih any age group awards or anything like that but i get it done . plus , it 's better to run and then partake in bad habits , lilke drinking soda and shifting around playing video games , than ti not run and still partake in bad habits ."
16345,true . . . nice chatting with you !
16346,"hi , have you ever played tetris ?"
16347,i have . one o amy favorites . i say its how i learned how to pac things in my fridge . i love how its one of teh top sellers stink to this day .
16348,"i think tetris gives us principles for many things , like accommodating joints on my trunk , it looks like it can have benefits like it can help quit smoking"
16349,ohhh really . i didnt know that i need to stop smoking . i will be looking to to . i wonder if they have it for the playstation . probably you think ?
16350,"it would be nice , and it is said that it can also help when sticking to a diet is difficult . probably because you bet addicted o hte game and stop thinking about food"
16351,"yah youre totally right . so there must be a playstation game out there to help with addiction too . ifr the department of defense is using ut , then i can use it for wealth ."
16352,is n't that cool . that 1760 playstation 3 's were used to build a super computer and it was a cheaper option ! !
16353,wow so cool . i feel likd there must be a movie on this . i want to know all the history . i know playstation in itself wins so may awards or innovations . i want to see that come to life .
16354,did you know playstation 3 's are being used to research black holes ?
16355,"oh i did not know that . i wonder how that is even happening . try cool to know . i wonder what kind of music they 're listening to while doing so . maybe jazz ; ,"
16356,"do you like jazz ? i love it , one of my favorite types of jazz is gypsy jazz ! !"
16357,"i like i come . i like the women from harlem who are music . , great piano players . know any ?"
16358,"jazz is so unique and you find this sort of things , like his woman ufo holds a convert on sundays and has done it for 20 years !"
16359,yea and pakistan jazz is currently at the old of that list . thats so cool to find out
16360,"see , i always thin about jazz from america and europe nut i really want to hear this orchestra from pakistan , they must be great !"
16361,have to be . im guessing rich in tradition . . . . while we have our african americans to help us stay connected to t all
16362,"jazz has traveled everywhere , because in a great part it came from west africa and then other things adopted from african american culture ."
16363,yes adn then back to america to refine . i use to listen to the fatter tempos stuff as a kid
16364,a famous actor who solves jazz is clint eastwood did you know that ;
16365,"i do , im not a fan of him then , tom e that makes him kinda a posner"
16366,"well , it was very nice o talk to you today . have a good one !"
16367,do you like tom cruise ?
16368,yes i do . did you know the last samurai is isn tube plural form ?
16369,"hmm i though it referred to one samurai , how come ?"
16370,"yeah it is in reference to the clan of samurai , note bust one"
16371,"oh cool . did you know tom sued the inventor of the hoveround , kruse , over the use of name ?"
16372,wow that is close . aladdin 's face was based ion tom
16373,cool . seinfeld has way more money can tom hanks and cruise together
16374,wow how musc money does he have under his he then ?
16375,well his net worth is 82 million
16376,wow that is a lot . did you know trey parker and matt stone once got cruise kick out of paramount ?
16377,wow what did he do ? cruise spent two years in japans hen e was preparing for the role of the samurai
16378,wow that is dedication . cruise can never be a honorary citizen of paris
16379,wow he must have rubbed them the wrong way somehow
16380,i guess . did you watch avengers infinity war ?
16381,"i did , it is the first film shot with dcigta liam cameras"
16382,nice . the guy who played jarvis in iron man has ever seen the film
16383,cool . do you know who is the waitress hat captain america saves in the avengers movie ?
16384,"i have no idea , is i someone we have seen elsewhere too ?"
16385,yes the was also gretchen in recess
16386,oh nice . disney is not allowed to show the big name marvel characters in their parks east of mississippi
16387,"wow that is strange , maybe there are some legal issues in there"
16388,"hi , how are you doing this evening ?"
16389,pretty well and you ?
16390,i 'm doing great ! do you like tom cruise and his films ?
16391,"i like him in om yes , like mission possible and the last samurai"
16392,he spent two years learning japanese and swordplay in preparation for the filming of the last samurai . he 's pretty dedicated .
16393,that is hardcore dedication for sure . aladdin 's face was based on him
16394,that 's funny ! i never made the connection . he seems like he 's a bit out of touch wth the average person ' reality though . he decided to when 10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens . does he know something we do n't ?
16395,"i thigh them like it , since he invented ll that money"
16396,"make he can sell it for a profit later on , and use his celebrity status t up the price . are you a fan of the star ars films ?"
16397,yeah that is possible . what will still not be enough to lift the ban that the city of paris put on him
16398,paris baned tom cruise ? why ?
16399,"not sure , he must have done something . well the put a ban on declaring him a honorary citizen"
16400,"oh , ok . i have n't really kept up on the star wars films . after the first three , they lost their magic to me ."
16401,"yeah seems like with most movies , the first few are so good and then it is downhill"
16402,"lucas has never won an oscar , but his wife has . george will just have to make do with his billions ."
16403,well she is the one who made some remarkable changes to the script so i think she deserves it
16404,"yeah , george really needs a building hand on things or he use does n't focus the story . he 's creative , but might have trouble with story structure ."
16405,yeah . 20th century fox thought the movie was going to flop
16406,"lucas got the merchandising rights and the rest is history . the franchise has made many people rich . amazes earl jones was paid 7 , 500 for the first movie , but i bet he got a bunch more in the next ones ."
16407,"yeah that is pretty remarkable , there is no way of knowing when the next genius is going to like"
16408,probably jj abrams . he seems to have the touch . i enjoyed chatting ! h ave a good evening !
16409,hi do you like movies ?
16410,"goods afternoon ! yes , i do enjoy movies and i try to watch a new release at least once a month . you ?"
16411,"that is cool , do not do it as often . ones of the ones that i admire the most is star wars series which started in 1977"
16412,"for sure star wars has been an epic anthology , s ve for the middle 3 m first 3 , , but i dd enjoy all of them nad ca n't wait for the new ones !"
16413,it is still alive ! ! dd you know that back in 2013 it as dubbed in navajo ?
16414,i did not know that i wonder ho many languages it has been translated to ? o row many countries irish even released in fascinating !
16415,i imagine many many languages but this was neat because it is th firs major all put in ah american native langue
16416,awesome the navajo community is very relevant where i live and i had nk idea that star wars wa 'the first major film ever translated to a native american language . assuming it was all 9 plus of the movies ?
16417,"i would imagine had . i found interesting that marcia lucas , george 's wife on , benched the movies"
16418,"i have heard that before , especially with the first movie , she had a lot of input and influence on scenes adn characters . i bet they have a solid relationship !"
16419,"she had to do with obi ans death , and leia ' good luck kiss , and she did a good job because she won an academy award ."
16420,"carrie fisher l leia , won an oscar for star wars ? those are all vivid d , iconic scenes sun with the later revelation that luke and leia are brother or since . ."
16421,that is pure fiction ! ! i you know that darth vader 's line swede recorded in about 2 . 5 hours ?
16422,"2 . 5 hours seems about right , he did n't speak very often mostly just heavy teaching . . ."
16423,"hahathat hat is true , james ear jones got pai 7500 for that ."
16424,"vader 's voice , he , is probably my favorite childhood memory of star wars t he first time i saw it , the voice was so calm , unique and creepy"
16425,"its used did get stuck in our minds , i think he should have been paid more ! !"
16426,seems fair for 1977 and they ha dino idea it was going to be a billion dollar industry no way !
16427,"looking from that perspective , it is probably , y fine , but star wars got so big that it even holds a guiness record for being succesful in merchandising , a nd i think we all want to have something ron star wars"
16428,amazing how they 've kept it going and gotten better in most aspect us the last jedi was awesome !
16429,i think they make us dream ! ! wel ; l it has been nice talking to you !
16430,do you like star wars ?
16431,absolutely ! how about yourself ?
16432,"no that much though i think it 's a awesome franchise . i like that it was been dubbed in differently languages for people to enjoy . it has even been dubbed in navajo , the first major film to do so ."
16433,"i did hear that , that is pretty cool . i hear that teh entire star wars is actually told by r2d2 hundred def yeas after the jedi !"
16434,"wow , i had to wrap my mind around tthat . george lucas ' wife put in many little details in the film . she got an academy award for editing . her husband did n't get an award fo directing ."
16435,yeah that is amazing ! have yu watched avengers infinity war ?
16436,i havne't actually . i har it 's the first film ever to be so completely with digital imax cameras .
16437,"yah th next movie is coming out next month , it was left with a pretty big cliff hanger ."
16438,interesting . so it is the 2nd in a trilogy ?
16439,"i have no idea if its going go be a trilogy . ot is she 3 movie in the avengers series , butt hd n't one is going to be the 4th ."
16440,"oh , i see . wow , i am really behind . i have not seen any of them . also , do they eat shawarma in the film s '"
16441,yeah ton stark talks about eating shawarma in the first one a i think hes eating it in the otehr 2 loan ow its a thing .
16442,"oh , i see , that 's why shawarma soles increased . now i want one ."
16443,its not a big scene lol amzing what a little tv time can do .
16444,"right , haha ! when i was younger i used to watch the hulk . i guess lou ferrigno who voiced the hulk voiced him for decades up to avengers age of ultron ."
16445,"yeah hes still making money for that role , amazing . it looks like the guy who is the voice of jarvus ahs never serena ny of 'the movies lol"
16446,wow i wonder why that is ?
16447,"i have no clue , i thought everyone has to be at those hollywood movie premiere lol"
16448,tha ties a glad point . i wonder gift om cruise has seen all his movies ? if not eh can catch up watching them can aliens does . he was a bunker in case they do .
16449,lol that is interesting . i wouldnt mind having an alien bunker ! lol did you know aladdin face is based on tom cruise ?
16450,no i did not notice that . do you think they look alike ?
16451,did you ever play tetris when you were younger ?
16452,i loved this on game boy ! how about you ?
16453,sure did . i heard there is a new version available for the playstation 4 . and you can actually play it in virtual reality grabbing the blocks with our hands .
16454,read that as well . never considered tetris to be the type of game that a vr enviroment would improve upon .
16455,"i wish i could afford a vr system , . my son has one for his pc . i played it and was totally addicted . i was thinking of getting the one with playstation 4 if i can ever get hugh money . i also want to get dead red redemption 2 . i heard a reviewer say puts as ' jaw dropping ' good ."
16456,"vr scares me some , especially when designers are trying to get you addicted"
16457,i was thinking about how people just sit in chairs hours on end staring straight ahead doing vr . then i started thinking people used to do that with tv . after coming home from work and eating dinner they would stay i front of the tv staring straight ahead not moving for hours until they went to bed . at least with vr you area origin your hands and with some games your whole body .
16458,"absolutely agree and tetris is a puzzle game that requires a thinking , geocentric skills , and other brain skills . the jazz music will also serve to stimulated bran synapseis , so not all bad i guess"
16459,i wass surprised to find out that playing it shaw positive effects . like for people suffering from ptsd . or those trying to stick to diets . i might start palying the originals version again until i can get a ps4 .
16460,"that is an interesting fact . there are a few versions available on android and apple devices for free . but yeah , the vr set up is going to be a super high demand product , especially for the age group that played it as a game boy game"
16461,i play gta 5 on my ps3 now . i am really into flight simulations and that one is the best for console i think until i get a pc that can handle one . o ca n't believe ps3s are researching black holes .
16462,i was just reading about tetris selling 455 million copies of of its franchise . that is enormous
16463,i ca n't believe the original creator did n't get any royalties cause it went to the soviet union . i guess it is n't copyrighted cause there are so many free nes now . at least the started getting some royalties in 1996 . i don ' how with so many free versions out there .
16464,hopefully he will be involved in the vr version and sony can do the right thing and get him caught up . did you see wii sporty is top 3 selling game ? not sure how taht is possible as tat game was terrible
16465,"actually the new one for playstation v nwas designed by t4tsuya mizuguchi , the japanese designer of teh game are , which i have never heard of . do you play any games ?"
16466,"i play some mobile games , and some xbox games like madden and nba 2k , but not a heavy gamer by any stretch"
16467,i never did many sports names . used to love tennis games . i don ' follow sports anymore . i am into hiking in the mountains now . i cav only had piss not ay xbox l .
16468,"healthy stuff , outdoors , always good . i worry that vr pulls people away from that"
16469,if you play mobile games hasve you heard of el ? i play it some . i find it relaxing . host mobile games do you recommend i try ?
16470,"i like the clash of clans genre , clash royale ect . i like the social aspect of playing with others versus solo"

16538,hello they . do you happen to be a marvel or warner brothers fan ?
16539,not particularly . i am not too into superheroes . how about you ?
16540,i really am . it is try interesting to me how developed land of the characters are . i also love to look up facts about the various movies . such as th exact that ' wonder woman ' was the highest grossing origin movie .
16541,"that ' e pretty coo . i did n't know that gal gadot , the new wonder woman , served two years as a soldier in the israel defense forces ."
16542,i did n't know that either . nor did i know that beauty and the beast were also an there for grossing income . i love also the day that the movies also work in true science
16543,very cool . jazz gadot was unaware she was auditioning for wonder woman . she thoughts he would be testing for catwoman .
16544,i ask did not know that warner brothers was trying to work out a superman cameo for the new ' aquaman ' movie . i bet gal gadot would be good for the new supergirl origin movie they are planning .
16545,that would be coo . i did n't know superman was first published way back in 1938 !
16546,wow that is true i believe it was april 18 the book was first published correct ? i am also fascinated that superman once wielded thor 's hammer .
16547,that neat . dc comics paid 130 in 1938 or exclusive rights to superman .
16548,. they did . i did not know that non new was in any of the warner brother movies .
16549,i didn ' know that either ! i also did n't know that wonderwoman was mad the secretary of the justice society when she first appeared in 1941 .
16550,that i actually did know . i like all the ' stars ' that are playing the roles now a days but i strongly feel that christopher reeve will always be the best superman especially since he gave one life to the role in the 70s .
16551,"he yeah , he was great . 2017 was the first year since 1958 that he top 3 grossing films were led by females ! pretty cool ."
16552,"that is pretty cool , thouhg i wish it had n't been almost 50 years ! i did not know that jerry singed and hoe shatter originally created superman , one has the believe they are millionaires by mow ."
16553,i ' k sure ! the writer ifr superman did not see their supervillain after a preexisting word htey actually coined the team ' brainiac . ' .
16554,that is so interesting . kind of works since henry cavill almost missed the call for the role of superman since he was playing ' world of warcraft ' . when i thik of that game i think of the world ' brainiac '
16555,"haha . too funny ! di you know that in sweden , it is illegal to name your child metallica , s superman , veranda , ikea and elvis ?"
16556,i did actually know that . with all these superheroes it does make the wonder if the universe does have superheroes somwhere since most of the universe is still unknown .
16557,that is . good point ! i didnt know there are stars in the universe cool enough for humans to touch !
16558,i did no know hat either . i also did not know that there i thought that the universe is one big super rhologrma .
16559,some people also think there is only one electron in the universe . hard to believe that one !
16560,it is hard to believe . also that we have n't queen all of the observable universe
16561,true . thanks for chatting !
16562,"hi , so you like superman ?"
16563,"i like some of the superman movies , but i 've been a little disappointed with the as of lat met i 've heard that fc is shifting their movies a little"
16564,do you know how much hey paid for the right to superman ?
16565,"only 130 back in 1938 , but who did they guy the rights from ?"
16566,i am thinking maybe it was from marvel
16567,"r maybe btw as fro mothe originals writer and artist jerry singed add joe shatter . still , superman has been popular for a long tim"
16568,yeah he has for sure . do you know her cavill ?
16569,he was the most recent superman . some think he wo n't e making had more movies witht cc
16570,yeah and he almost pissed the call for superman
16571,i guess each as more hope in continuing aquaman then they do in doing any future superman movies wit cavill
16572,do you know his they named teh villain ?
16573,"i 'm not sure , but i do n't think the name existed before they used it"
16574,"yeah that is true . they made it up , brainiac"
16575,"it 's illegal to name your child superman in sydney . you also ca n't use the names elvis , ikea , metallica , or veranda . i think that shows what they deem important"
16576,wow tha ties intereting . did you watch wonder woman ?
16577,"i dis , and it was a great movie ! it 's no wonder that it 's the highestgrossing superhero movie"
16578,yeah and also the highest grossing wwi movie too
16579,"gal gadot , who pays wonder woman , did n't even know which role she wasa auditioning for . she thought a was for the role of catwoman"
16580,"yah , that ie funny how she got it anyways"
16581,it might be because she 's good for the role . i ponder if wear ability to do it well has tc two with the two years she served in the israel defense forces as a soldier
16582,i n't it does a lot actually . nice chat
16583,"hello , how are you ? do you like dc ? dc comics paid 13 fin 1938 for exclusive rights to superman ."
16584,"i am not that into superheros , but i recently heard that there is most likely gong to be a new actor playng superman ."
16585,"that 's a bummer , i love henry cavill as superman . henry cavill almost misses 'the al for the role of superman cause he was playing g ' world of warcraft '"
16586,unbelievable ! the most successful dceu release in north america was wonder woman .
16587,"thats crazy lol and , the writers for superman did not name their supervillain after a preexisting word htey actually contend the term ' brainiac . '"
16588,that 's pretty cool . superman gained the facility to fly but the request of fischer studios because animating his repeated jumps was too difficult .
16589,"haha , but did n't he already know how to fly ? in swede , it is illegal to name your child metallica , superman , veranda , ikea and elvis ."
16590,right ? ! that 's interesting . term was a version of superman created where superman was raised in the soviet union .
16591,oh weird . superman once wielded horn 's hammer . not because he was a superman but because he was ' worthy ' .
16592,"enact ! marvel comics creator stan lee wrote 15 dc comics , reimagining popular superheroes like batman and superman ."
16593,"that was probably a good call . they look way more metal now . gal gadot , the new wonder woman , served wo years as a soldier in the israel defense forces ."
16594,that 's awesome ! the lego movie was the first ever feature film with wonder woman in i .
16595,whoa chat an interesting one ! gal gadot was unaware she was auditioning for wonder woman . she thought she would be testing for catwoman
16596,"it worked out in her favor ! when wonder woman first appeared as a member of the justice society in 1941 , the group made hr their secretary ."
16597,"omg lol she has super powers an you askew her a secretary lol wit h , star wars : the last jedi , beauty an 'the beast , wonder woman , 2015 was the first year since 1958 , south pacific , auntie jame , cat on a hot tin roof , that the top 3 highest grossing domestic films were female led ."
16598,"seriously ! the inventor of the lie detector test , william houston marathon , also created wonder woman , who fields the classy o truth ."
16599,ahhhhhh interesing !
16600,there is a silver coin wih superman on the heads side that s legal render in canada .
16601,lucky canada !

16605,"hi , i love the moo n ! ! i love to watch a full moon"
16606,"i dont usually pay attention to it , but it has shaped so much of human culture ."
16607,"it has , but the earth is not the only planet with a moon , m ars has a moon named phobos"
16608,many planets have moons . ours is synchronized so that it always shows the gamer face to us .
16609,do you know that the highest point of the moon is ?
16610,i have no idea say i cant imagine that it is that high ? the earth is much bigger r .
16611,it is 13 mets higher has mt everest
16612,"whoa . that is high . i wouldnt want to climb that , even in low gravity . if you fall , you could die ."
16613,it looks like they wanted to put a un flag instead of an american flag o nthe moon ! but regardless we can not see it
16614,"yeah , i heard that the flag would be breached white after all the radiation hitting it . soon the chinese will hav flags everywhere"
16615,"that is probably true ! hey , do you like music '"
16616,i love music . what kind of music do you like ?
16617,"i love all kinds of music , especially rock , i like to play the bass and would like to play violin !"
16618,that is great ! the bas sis a great instrument . every band needs a bass player . the violin is a funny instrument though .
16619,i found intersting that einstein played the violin and the piano really well !
16620,"the creative , intellectual mind needs many outlets , including creative ones ."
16621,he said that great scientists are asl great artists !
16622,"yes , but great artists are not great scientists ! why is that ? anyway , great chat !"
16623,"yes so much to talk about , music , astronomy . . it has been great i agree !"
16624,have a good night !
16625,you too ! !
16626,i really enjoy writing poetry i can relate to poet of centuries ago
16627,"hi , that 's coo ? do you enjoy reading it as well ?"
16628,i do . i love the iliad and tech odyssey even studied those when i lived in italy .
16629,"wow ! i remember reading edgar allan poe 's , the raven , while i was in school and being shocked wen 9 found out , he only got paid 9 for it ."
16630,wow that is not very much money ! i wonder if demetri martin got anything for his 224 word palindrome poem !
16631,i would hop ; e he did . you know that had to be very har to do !
16632,"for sure . but there is another poem which when read normally is depressing , but is inspiring hen read backwards !"
16633,"how awesome , i 'll have to try and read that hen i to the time ."
16634,yes and study some javanese if you read their alphabet in order you get another poem !
16635,"cool , i did n't know that either . they must be a very poetic people in java ?"
16636,i think so . i believe they are big on the violin there too did you kno wthe is a violin made of tone that is playable ?
16637,"wow , fully playable nad out of stone . that must be a gifted violin maker ."
16638,yes . techniques have improved a lot over the years . modern violins are preferred over stradivarius when there are blind sound tests
16639,"nad here i thought the stradivarius were the best sounding in the world ; x ? my hairdresdser plays violin and se ? s pretty good on it , but i hear albert einstein was a gifted on the violin as well as the piano ."
16640,yes h thought that the greatest scientists are artists as sell
16641,"it makes sense to me . funny my hairdr3sser refers to 24 as a fiddle when ' ' e jamming with the local bluegrass boys , but when her symphony friends re in town , she ca , lot it a violin !"
16642,larry of the 3 stooges was greg at the violin as well !
16643,"yeah , i had heard he burned himself very badly with aid when e was little and he used the violin lessons to strengthen the damaged parts of his arm ."
16644,ye stiff it had not been for ww1 he woudl have gone to a european musics conservatory
16645,good thing he did n't . we probably would n't have had the three stooges movies . they were o funny to watch as a kid .
16646,i was never a big fan . i was more into science stuff like watching people go to th moon .
16647,that 's cool too . well it 's been fun chatting with you . enjoy th ernest of your day !
16648,"hello , do you like poetry ?"
16649,"i do enjoy poetry , what about you ?"
16650,"some of it yes . i recent , y discovered that there is a poem that is depressing , but if you read it backwards it is actually inspiring g ."
16651,"woah a lot of talen t , do you like edgar allan poe ?"
16652,his i like him .
16653,"do you know his poem the raven ? its really famous , i bet you do"
16654,"yes , i have heard that poem before , very dark , interesting . do you like that poem ?"
16655,"i like it its one of my favorite , dark but so interesting , well cool fact about that poem is the it was sold for only 9 dollars"
16656,"that is a shame , its definitely the most popular in of his ."
16657,"i the a shame he got a really ad deal , there are many poems about the moon , the moon sure is a beautiful astronomical body"
16658,"yes , the largest moon on mars is 1 or 3 hollow ! weird ."
16659,really ? it must be really cool as well i wonder if the moon dust over there is also dangerous .
16660,"probably , moon hay fever doesnt sound good ."
16661,"doesnt sound good at all i agree , did you hear about the apollo 11 mission and how nasa wanted to place a un flag instead of an american flag in the moon ?"
16662,"lol yeh , the funny . i hear the is evidence of methane based life on te moon of saturn ."
16663,"woah , thats so too i wonder if we will ever win smart life in another planet , maybe there 's intelligent life in mars already and they are hiding from our telescopes ."
16664,maybe . have you seen that movie bout mars having life on it ? it ss a scary movie .
16665,i did n't but i bet he was a scary movie on another note do you know him to play the violin ?
16666,"no i never learned how , do you ?"
16667,mo not really i think its really hard but its a nice instrument i would like to learn ow to play it some day .
16668,i am more of a piano person .
16669,"the piano is also great but i like violin or fiddle as many call it , it 's been a great chat , i enjoyed talking with you"
16670,"same to you , thanks for the chat !"

16675,that 's a bargain ! it 's illegal to name your child superman in sweden .
16676,i know that 's crazy ! s superman is one the mostly lucrative superhero franchises
16677,henry cavill almost missed the call for the role of superman cause eh was playing ' world of warcraft '

16683,"the funny ! wonde woman appeared in 2016 in batman vs . superman , goo ."
16684,so let 's talk about th universe . there are scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection much like different species do on earth
16685,"that 's interesting ! the universe is all of space and time and their contents , including planets , stars , galaxies , and all other forum of matter and energy ."
16686,"ah , and what about this , the universe might be one giant superhologram"
16687,freaky ! there is a region of space tha my be pulling galaxies outside the observable universe .
16688,"there 's a theory that there is only one electron in the universe , m i woudl ike to read more about that ."

16704,yes they are comedies where there are romance between friends likd 'the hangover
16705,that makes a lo the sense . do you watch comedy central at all ?
16706,"i watch it sometimes , they have some good ones in there"
16707,yeah and they have cancelled 100 shows since they fame to be in 1989
16708,i guess that is not a lot considering how long they have been around
16709,that is true actually . do you know the programming language python ?
16710,"i have heard of it , is that somehow related to comedy"
16711,"yes , the name comes from a british comedy group , monty python"
16712,"oh that is pretty sweet , theyd re immortality then"
16713,how 's it going ? are you a batman fan ? michael keaton recently gave a commencement speech at kent stat end ended it by saying ' i 'm batman '
16714,"i love the batman movie i think reason was the best , bale did a great job thouhg ."
16715,"yea , better than val kilmer , too ba michel keaton turned down 15 million to reprise the role in batman forever"
16716,"yeah , way 's a lot of money . i think they blacklisted him over stat ."
16717,"that sucks , i 'm dissapointed universal studios never made a real gotham city"
16718,"leah , thaat definetly would have been cool . in the newer bahamas i think they just used nyc ."
16719,i did n't know hat . i guess the is a russia version of batman that teams us with the teenage mutant ninja turtles
16720,"yeah , that 's interesting . did you watch want when you were younger ?"
16721,"yea i saw the movies although i enjoyed batman more , i use to watch the 1960 's tv show"
16722,"nice , i watched all of the batman movies . f them all i liked batman with keaton and jack ."
16723,"yea , i just watched the movies thought , i never read the comics , apparently stan le wrote some reimagined batman comics"
16724,i read that somewhere ? i 'm not all that familiar with him . i did n't know the dark knight rises mate over 1 billion .
16725,"that is impressive . do you also like comedy movies ? apparently kung fu hustle is suppose to be very funny , bill murray really enjoyed it"
16726,"murray is a great actor . i 've never seen kung fu hustle , have you seen it ?"
16727,"no i have n't , it 's hard o fin online ridge heard a lot of good things about it besides bill murray calling it ' the supreme achievement of the modern ate in terms of comedy '"
16728,i liked his movies like caddyshack . have you seen it ?
16729,"yea , caddy shack was great , so was ghost busters , stripes , and a bunch of others"
16730,the actor that played erin from ghostbusters passed away . a shame .
16731,did n't he graduate from harvard ? . know demetri martin went to harvard law before dropping out from boredom
16732,"'m not sure , good question . he was also a famous director , that i do now ."

16734,"awesome , he was a great comedian ."
16735,"hey there , 9 was wanting to join the millions and watch teh world cup this year , i think ."
16736,"i wish i could have gone but it was very expensive to travel etc russia , i 'll have to wait until it comes to north america ."
16737,"yea , that is a good point . i dont like flying very much . the united states got rd place in the first fifa world cup in 1930 . sort of a neat fact ."
16738,it 's flights surprising that the us men have newer won a world cup . i know that there are a lot of talented countries but i would have thought hey 'd have won at least one by now .
16739,"tech , that is amazing because there is a lot of talent . i learned that there re no net economic gains for the countries that have played host to the olympic s , that seems odd ."
16740,"it costs a lot to host an olympic games , some countries have part of the infrastructure already but a lot end up building stadiums and armies that become abandoned after ."
16741,"oh that is a really good point , i have n't not ever though of it that way before . totally makes sense ."
16742,i know that was a problem with brazil and china recently . their stadiums are completely out of bye now .
16743,"oh wow , sort of sad . i also like to follow the player cristiano ronaldo hte pro footballer form portugal ."
16744,"yes he 's had a rough couple o months in she headlines recent , ty though ."
16745,"mega , i know , i even heard that he was excelled from school for throwing a chair at a teacher . that seems a little extreme ."
16746,"his school probably had a zero tolerance policy , a lot of schools do these days ."
16747,thai probably a good rule and very true . i know that he also refuses to get any tattoos on his body in order to be able to donate blood . that seems like a very worthy cause and a good person to do that .
16748,yes he does have a lot of great qualities . i saw an interview where someone attempted to speak portuguese to hm that did not speak it natural . 04 chastised the other reporters for making fun of that person 's attempt .
16749,"haha , nice . i like people to stick up to bullies i nthe media cora anywhere else ."
16750,i originally did not care much for him because he seemed cocky but thors seems to only be on the football field where probably hazy earned the right to be a little bat of a showboat .
16751,"yeah , it would be funny if players had to wear a hat associated with their personality . the most popular hat in history was a bowler hat , n ot the cowboy hat ."
16752,"it 's a lot smaller , i bet it stayed on your head better on a windy day ."
16753,"yeah , that would holes a lot . the origins of a conical party hat that was derived from the dunce cap hey were worn at parties to encourage foolish and silly behavior , lol ."
16754,i 've probalby banged myself f ew dunce aps at parties enforce !
16755,"ha , you and me both !"
16756,"it was fun chatting with you today , have a good one !"
16757,why tube do you ever wear a hat ? i 'm personally bald so i wear one all the time lol
16758,i think i look funny in them so i do n't haha .
16759,"haha , well i just think they look god on me , but i kno everyone ha sa different shard head . i guess hat until 1998 , british politicians had to wear a top hat , that seem really silly"
16760,intresting . i think the royal canadian mounted police hats look pretty coo l .
16761,what dot hose look like ? i do n't know that i 've seen them before . do you ever watch old western movies ? apparently the bowler cap was more popular tha the cowboy hat
16762,i guess they are describedof as peaked or brimmed . i do n't think they are protective . they look kind of like a forest manager hat .
16763,"ok i 'll have to check those out sometime , do you know what a hairpins is by the way ? do you know the ones that females wear , apparently in 1908 they passed a , aw to limit their length , they were worried that people use them as weapons lol"
16764,that is pretty do . i want a weapon hairpins haha . another cool thing i 'd like is a hat and a sword that i 'd get if i go to phd in finland .
16765,"wow that 's cool ! they should give those out everywhere haha . you kno whoo you con till your hat ? apparently that started with knights using their face visors , that 's pretty cool"
16766,interesting ! i think we should go back to wearing calls sports of different hats . london black cabs design was originally made to accommodate the height of bowl ; er hats .
16767,"i agree with you , i do n't think people are enough hats these days haha . did you ever wear a dunce cap before ' appartently the conical party hat was used to encourage foolish behavior and that 's how hte urine cap was started"
16768,fortunately i have never had to wear a dunce cap . protective hats are really useful . the plastic made to use legs is the space to make hard hats
16769,"ye si agree with you . i also like how hats can have religious functions , there are the sites hats wondr by bishops and turbans that he sikhs wear"
16770,i guess chefs hats keep hair out off did but it also has symbolic meaning .
16771,"that is interesting . interesting too that soccer players do n't need go wear hats lol , are you going to watch the fifa world cup this year"
16772,"no , i am not really into sports . i know thatn early 50 percent of the world watches it though ."
16773,"yes i agree . i 'm not into sports either , and i 'm ; specially do n't like soccer lol . it is interesting that there is no net economic pain to hosting the world cup , o 'the olympics for that matter , i wonder why country still do it"
16774,qatar wanted . world cup to be there and they provide dairy conditioned stadiums that would reduce the temperature by 20 cesiuds but also were solar powered .
16775,"oh wow interesting . i did n't know that k , i know that yes they are doing the 2002 fifa cup , but the city that is going to host it is n't even built yet apparently ? that seems like it 's coming up fast lol"
16776,"oh , interesting . i die not know they got the id ."
16777,yes they did . did you know that hungry used to be really good at soccer by the way ? between 1950 and 1956 they had only one defeat ? and that was in the world cup finals
16778,"politicians in britain had to wear a top hat in the house of commons , that 's hilarious !"
16779,"really , that 's interesting . it seem almost the opposite of what is expected in america . wearing hats inside is usually considered rude ."
16780,"yea , america is funny when it comes to hats , they even passed a law 100 years ago limiting the length of hatpins so they could n't be used as a weapon"
16781,"we have such silly dems when it comes to cats . pink about the mortarboard we wear for graduation , . do thought that lilly thing up ."
16782,"i do n't know , i read that conical party hats were derived from dunce caps"
16783,"and were ou aware that in the old west , it was ' 'the cowboy what that was the most . ; sugar , but actually the bowler hat ."
16784,"that 's crazy , i do n't even think silver seen a bowler hat , must not be that cool if they wee n't in the movies"
16785,"i beaver put much thought into it , but i guess hats have all kinds of various functions , such as protecting from weather , religious reasons , and of course to be fashionable ."
16786,"yea , knights wore hats and helmets to protect themselves in battle"
16787,"i guess a helmet could be considered a type of hat . i never thought about it that way . why co you think twice wear hats ? it is n't protecting much , and the royal canadian police have th egoofiest looking hats there are"
16788,"i do n't know , maybe to keep hte sun out their eyes . rain"
16789,that 's true . does it get sunny in canada ? i just assumed it was all covered in snow all the time . haha .
16790,"i do n't know , they do play a lot of hockey and when 3 goals are scored by one player it 's cal , ed a hat trick"
16791,it seems liek people do n't wear hats as often these days ss they used to many years ago . like when you see a movie about engpladn hundreds if years ago and all te rich people wore hats . maybe it wa alike a status symbol of sorts back then .
16792,"bet , i know rich people like to tip their hats which started from medieval knights"
16793,oh really ? that is an interesting origin of thati custom . do people still tip their hats to each other ?
16794,sometimes just to be funny mostly
16795,"you know who else wars hats , chefs . well , at least in the movies . i don ' know if i have eve seen a chef actually wearing a hat while cooking ."
16796,basebal . players wear hats too
16797,"true , hence baseball caps which are popular with everyone there days , but they do seem to serve a function with baseball pales ."
16798,"that is true , i think i 'm going ahead to the mall to look for an ew hat , nice talking with oi"
16799,"hi there , do you wear hats at all ?"
16800,i do wear a hat sometimes as protection against the sun and weather .
16801,nice . did you know british politicians in order to make a point in the house of commons had to wear a top hat ?
16802,that is funny . i always thought they wore a whig . chefs have their own style of hats as well called the toque .
16803,"i guess everyone ha some sports of a hat to wear . apparently the most popular read used to be the older one , not the cowboy hat in the old west"
16804,and do n't forget to styles that catholic bishops wear or the light urban
16805,yup for sure . do you know how the whole thing about tipping the hat originated ?
16806,no how did that start ? i think its funny tha london cabs have thur design they o to accomodate hats !
16807,that is a good only . it came from he knights back in the day who raised their visors to show friendliness
16808,that makes sense . i wonder whether they had phd 's ? in finland when you get your degree you get a top hat and a sword !
16809,"nice , sounds so royal . switching topics here , do you watch soccer at all ?"
16810,"i usually only watch the world cup i do n't follow it day to day , just the championships"
16811,like . do you know where the 2022 one is taking place ?
16812,i believe in qatar even though it is crazy hot there . japan made a bid for it however .
16813,yeah but it seems the city where it will take place does not exist as of yet . maybe they are building it still
16814,"that is pretty crazy though if 46 percent of the global population watch the world cup , then it should be able to raise some money !"
16815,i know so i do not understand how the host countries do not make any money off of ot .
16816,yes you would think they would . did you know that there was once a group hat ender wit a sway tie ? wonder how that got resolved ?
16817,"wow , that is too co , duplicated , maybe they just the to keep playing as other . us team does not seems to be doing really well though , except for the women 's team"
16818,yes the womens team has done really well . new zealand dod great in 10 they went undefeated !
16819,tthat is pretty cool . do you have a favorite soccer player ?
16820,i really like cristiano ronaldo . h eis probably the best player in the world .
16821,i think as of right now he certainly is . nice chatting with you
16822,"how ' it going , do you like the lion king ? it was the first disney film dubbed into zulu"
16823,"yes i watched the lion king several times , i like the song by elton john ."

16827,"yes i saw most of it , but not the end , i enjoyed wreckitralph , the part i saw ."
16828,"it got great reviews , i wonder if he toy industry go involved with it 's production like tey do with other disney movies"
16829,"i would think so , did you know star wars was ther second highest grossing film at all time ."
16830,"shih one , the original 1977 movie or one of it 's sequels ?"
16831,"i ma not positive , but i think the original 1977 ."
16832,yea that one is my favorite . it 's crazy the entire star wars franchise is worth 65 billion
16833,"i yes , i remember it was one of the most popular and high rated movie that brough tin millions ."
16834,marcia lucas did a great obj making changes to george 's original scripts and made the movies better
16835,"ye 'you are right , i was n't familiar with marcia lucas as i was with george lucas ."
16836,i wonder how much money she made since george got to keep the licensing and merchandising rights of star wars
16837,"i ca n't imagine , i wonder why disney recycled a lot of their animation frames ?"
16838,"probaby to saver only , i guess reusing frames would save disney time too"
16839,"yes i agree with you , have you even return of th jedi the film of 1983 , if yes did you like it ?"
16840,"yea , the ending to return if the jedi eas goods ut i found the other parts boring"
16841,"have you ever was the book , i got more from the book than i got from the movie , that was king of odd for me , . because i do n't take time to read that much or"

16852,"yeah , i bet george ad mixed feelings about that one . he never got an oscar , but he got billions . oh well ."
16853,"yikes , that would give me mixed feelings lol . did you ever hear what james earl jones made for voicing vader ?"
16854,"i dont think he was paid a lot , but he probably got royalties or something ."
16855,"for sure , i think it was like 7500 dollars , but royalties added up too"

16965,yea plus marcia lucas really made the story of the original trilogy better
16966,she had a good understanding of th story . george needs guidance on such things . he is creative but needs others to snake his ideas .
16967,"yea , maybe hehe stopped airing after making billions fro , the licensing and merchandise from star wars"

16970,"i havent seen it . i know that it is based in comic book . i usually dont watch those films . anyway , great chat !"

16983,yeah and spain is the only country that has been a permanent guest at every g20 summit .
16984,that is really weird of them . i wonder why they would not request official membership ? have you heard of the game eve online
16985,dunno . maybe they feel that they are a guaranteed member .
16986,well it 's an online computer game . i guess they apparently have world summits and they received the world summit award from the united nations
16987,"did you kno wthe when or if you turn 100 in japan , the p sends you a silver cup ?"
16988,that ' w really cool . it 's nice that it comes from the prime minister too . also so many people were running 100 they the to find a way tom fake a cheaper cup hahha
16989,yep . i ca n't believe that in 1995 a radio station successfully prank called queen elizabeth i . i bet someone got fired over tthat .
16990,oh definitely ! i love that the prime minister of the uk has a cat with th government title chief mouser to the cabinet office . that is sofa awesome .
16991,i 'm sure that is one pampered online . the pm of australia 's position does n't actually exist in their constitution . not much job security there . . .
16992,note that seems really screwy . have you herd of the actress helen bonham carter ? the was in the harry potter movies
16993,"yes , she 's the greatgranddaughter of the pm of the uk during ww i ."
16994,yep is n't that wild . i just think the prime minister idea is so different fox that of a president being ana american i dont ' know how i feel about it . i do like the idea of our resident more though hhaa
16995,"ho 's it going , are you into fashion at all ? nancy pelosi 's stilettos shaw been gettin coverage on msnbc"
16996,yes i am . i think that 's an odd thing to cover . but it would be tough to give na 8 hour speech in those things .
16997,"it 's funny how high eels are being used in political rhetoric , like ann richards commenting on finger rogers being able to do what fred astairec an except in high heels"
16998,yes i was kind of interesting . it seems like it 's more a power move than anything else .
16999,"yea , i guess the ferragamo caa pump was a popular shoe for politicians"
17000,yeah it sounds like it . some people call those highheeled shoes postmenopausal mary jane 's !
17001,apparently the us is the only place obsessed witty politician 's shoes m even in britain they cared what theresa my wears on her feet
17002,that is kind of interesting . first lady melania trump wa smarted as disaster barbie for wearing 4 inch high heels when she bearded air force one .
17003,"yea even people took issue when michelle obama word elanvin capitol sneakers to a food bank , it would be nice if people just mind their business"
17004,yes i agree . did you know there ar at least go ways to tie your shoes ?
17005,"no , i had no clue . you can also put dry tea bags in yours holes to absorb odder"
17006,off hat 's good to know . bill nye the science guy holds a patent for ballet pointe shoe s .
17007,h must make a lot of money since professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in one week
17008,yes exactly . here are wizard of oz inspired shoes that actually guide you home when you click your heels together using a gps system .
17009,that 's pretty do but i bet the shoes stephon marbury promotes do n't have gps in them since they sell or 15
17010,yeah exactly . i wish shoes cost that much nowadays . queen elizabeth ii employs somebody to wear her shoes before the to ensure they 're comfortable . must be nice .
17011,"yea , the uk s quite odd , the prime minister 's ca thas the official title of chief mouser to the cabinet office"
17012,"that is quite funny and odd . in 1995 a radio station successfully prank ca , led queen elizabeth ii by pretending to be the prime minister of canada !"
17013,"that 's pretty funny , i wonder if the uk 's prime minister ever give out gifts liek japan 's"
17014,yes i 'm not sure . andrew binary la is the only person from outside the uk to ever become the prime minister of uk . it was creat taking with you today .
17015,"well i have to go , nice chatting with you top"
17016,"hi , how are you ?"
17017,alirigth . do you have any interest in shoe styles ? their designs have varied throughout human history
17018,a little . i want to be more involved in style but have a wife and 2 little ons so have no money for style .
17019,"yea , i really only care about how comfortable they are but a lot of people are obsessed over them liek when nancy pelosi wore 4 inch stilettos during a speech"
17020,"amaze she 's jist reaaly all and wanted to seem bigger and more powerfull than she really ia . as a 6 ' 6 ' male , fashion does not come in my size so i do n't even worry bout it ."
17021,"probably , people want to make statements with their fashion choice , especially women . i guess a ferragamo sara pump enders you to the working class , at least if your name richards"
17022,are n't those expensive ? maybe not as expensive as 4 pairs of ballet shoes a week but still expensive . . .
17023,"i hae no idea , maye from a man 's points of view but i guess a lot of women see ferragamo sara pumps as lower end shoes"
17024,i am sure they do not perform as well as 5000 year ol does though .
17025,would not surprise me at all if a 5000 year old basin sandal with a phd soil lasted longer than ann richards pumps or condoleezza rice 's knee high boots
17026,' freeze frame matrix jump ' ha ! i wonder what the military thought of her dress . . . .
17027,lol who knows . people were upset with michelle obama or wearing 5000 pair of sneakers to z food bank
17028,"no , they were upset they could n't afford 542 sneaker sr haters ! i get burned when people do stuff like that . 40 is such a small part of her wealth that it 's like 50 to normal people ."
17029,"lol , yea , i really would n't even get the to tell what a landing canoe swede sneakers looked like or if they were not hoover 500 , in fact i would n't even get king at the shows"
17030,me do ! i found steve smith leaving his shoes on the field as a rememberance to homeless without shoes a a nice gesture .
17031,"yea , steve smith is as pretty stand up guy , too bad most people outside the teams he use to play for wouldnt ' now about him leaving out his cleats as a gesture for homelessness"
17032,m going to try and put te bags in my gym shoes . see if it works to absorb odor . . .
17033,"lol , i did n't even know tea bags in a shoe could absorb odor , i wonder which type of tea works best"
17034,i 'll let you know if it is a grey since that isp hat i have at home . . .
17035,"sounds good , all i have is some cheap green tea bags at home , i 'll see i those can get rid of shoe odor"
17036,me chatting with you !
17037,hi there . i love buying shapes ! i feel that shoe quality is decreasing !
17038,really ? i know very little about shoes .
17039,yes apparently there was a 5000 year old pair of shoes that performed better than their modern counterparts .
17040,that makes sense . i bet that those shoes had to last a whole lifetime . no way to buy replacement . lol
17041,yes exactly ! the nba player stephon marbury promoted a line of shoes retailed at 15 .
17042,why so cheap ? that seems a bit do ? i guess he wanted to make them available for everyone ?
17043,"yes i think you 're right , what explains his he did n't accept any promo money to o it ."
17044,"ok , that makes sense . i guess the shoes would least long enough to be worth the money ."
17045,"yeah good point . there was also a football player , steve smith , who left his cleats on the field to raise awareness for homeless people ."
17046,"that is a great gesture . i wish more athletes would do things , ike that ."
17047,"me too . do you follow the news at all ? the primed sinister of uk , theresa may has been trying to get a brexit deal . 10 downing street is her residence !"
17048,may has a difficult task in front of her . i know that they have cost a short while before the whole brexit thing is supposed to go into effect .
17049,yeah it sounds very clustered and confusing . what a mess . one odd fact about the prime minister in australia is teh fact that the position is n't even in the constitution !
17050,that is strange . i guess hey just used the uk system because hey knew how it worked . strange .
17051,yes i suppose so . i would want to turn 100 in japan because the prior minister sends you a xsivler cup to celebrate . hopefully full of alcohol !
17052,"yes , fine japanese sake ! a lot of people live to 100 there . ja ; pan might have to rethink giving out cups !"
17053,haha they are doing something right ! maybe the cheaper cups could just be ed solo party cup d !
17054,lol i guess we could try to prank the japanese prime minister into giving out cups like that .
17055,haha it just might work . heat actress who played bellatrix in harry potter is a descendant of a uk prime minister 21
17056,i don really know the actors for harry potter . bellatrix ?
17057,her actual amaze is helena bonham carter . very good actress . well every ice talking with you today . bye !

17070,did you know james earl ones sunset only 2 . 5 hours recording darth vader lines lol he made 7500 . 00
17071,no way ! sometimes things are best done the first time . ca n't believe bill murray auditioned fort he role pf han solo haha .
17072,"me either , i dont think he is a good fit though ,"
17073,i know i think bill murray is too much of a party animal . juan solo is a pilot !
17074,do you like disney ?
17075,"i liked disney a lot more when i was younger , i was a huge fan . now , only a little ."
17076,i see . i just learned frozen was hte first animated disney movie directed by a woman .
17077,pretty interesting . what else is interesting is that it would take over 9 . ; 4 millions ballons to lift carl 's house int he movie up !
17078,that is an insane amount of balloons . i wonder i they have ever tried it .
17079,someone probably will eventually . jungle book was one of my favorites . the cultures hair looks like those of the beatles !
17080,"that was a good movie , i really liked aladdin , little mermaid was good too ."

17086,i would have to say the very first star wars but they were all good i thnk . the empire strikes back was really good too !
17087,"il hiked it a lot as well but i think that the clone wars was better , for maybe episode i"
17088,good one too ! ! 's crazy how 20th century fox thought star wars would be af love ! i ca n't imagine how such money these movies made in total !
17089,"i imagine that a lot , considereing the amount of fans the franchise has , it even was the first movie to be duped in navajo"
17090,rings ! i thought that as awesome . i do know the first 8 films made over 8 billion . . . . that ? s not including the merchandise ! star wars holds a guiness world record for most successful merchandise franchise .
17091,"i didnt know that , that a lot of money what i dd know is that the franchises ad an estimated value of 65 billion dollars ! !"
17092,wow ! that is insane ! did you sew solo ; wa start ars story ? al pacino turned down the role of han solo because he did n't understand the script !
17093,"i did see that one , and thats crazy , he missed o np really bi rule , that would have changed his carreer for sure ."
17094,"exactly , too bad i guess lol , also the here thinking of casting christopher walked but do n't know why he did n't get the part ."
17095,"h would have been a good han solo , there i a hole story bind solo , like how he was a tie fighter pilot before ."
17096,"true ! he would have been great in tht role . i did n't know tha true , very interesting . id id n't know solo ; a star wars story was distributed by walt disney studios motion pictures ! i love walt disney !"
17097,"yeah , disney bought the franchise or the rights of star wars , and i also love disney , one of my favorites , the lion king"
17098,"wo w , i did n't know that . and yes i love the lion king ! it was the 1st disney film to be dubbed into zulu for the african release , pretty cool !"
17099,"i guess that answers par of the question of why disney i do popular , did you watch frozen ?"
17100,"yes , i does ! yes , frozen is great ! and it was directed by a woman , first time for an animated film !"
17101,"it is ! it las interesting how the toy industry gets involved with money and the final before they even begin , a lot of money there too huh !"
17102,"i know , i read that too , pretty crazy . i guess the toy industry is probably a huge part of all disney productions !"
17103,"i guess it i s , and disney is considered as one of she ' big six ' film studios , that is pretty interesting as well ."
17104,hello are you a star wars fan ?
17105,"absolutely yes . i love star wars , the american epic space opera franchise created by george lucas s ."
17106,me too ! k was only 7 years old whe nthe first one came out so the timing was perfect for me . james earl jones only spent 2 . 5 hours recording all of darth vaders new for the first movie .
17107,"and , made 7 , 500 . for it . according to george lucas , the entire star wars saga is told by r2d2 , some hundred years after return of the jedi ."
17108,interesting . i 'm looking forward to the final installment . i really liked the spinoffs so far . the solo slow was pretty good . originally al pacino turned down the role of han solo in the original film . i never knew hat .
17109,"i know i loved all hem do far . starting off , we had the star wars trilogy to the first one in 1977 , empire strokes back in 1980 , andre euro of the jedi in 1983 ."
17110,did you like the rogue one spinoff ?
17111,"yes , very much so . i liked the prequel trilogy a sweet that was released between 1999 and 2005 although it had mixed reactions to other critics and fan so i believe rogue one was in 2016 ."
17112,"yes l i liked the prequel trilogies . i thought phantom menace was good even though a lot of people seem to not like it . some of the digitized characters i could have done without i . but , t he storyline was good ."
17113,"yes , well the later movies hav do lot to live up to . star wars is teh second highest grossing film series of all time . the film series has spawned into other media including book , tv shows , computer and video games , theme park attractions as wel as comic books resulting in significant development . the series ' fictional universe ."
17114,it ' incredible te business with as done . ass of 2018 the value of the sun was franchise was estimated to be a staggering 65 billion dollars ! wow ! ! ! ! ! ! !
17115,"yes , a it 's currently the fifthhihgestgrossing media franchise . that is a big wow ."
17116,crazy numbers indeed . in 2013 it wars was dubbed in navajo making it te first major film to be dubbed in a native america language .
17117,"awesome , did you know that colin mcgregor , star war 's actor , ewan mcgregor 's brother is a british pilot and goes y the callsign obi two ' ? how coo i that ?"
17118,oh wow ! that is neat ! i never new that . fascination !
17119,"yes , and that james cameron decided to quit his truck driving job to enter the film industry after watching star wars ?"
17120,talk about a good career move that would pay off down the road ! marcia lucas was ther reason for some major changes to the original movie and won an academy award for editing the film .
17121,another fun fact that i learned is that there 's a tough ans solo in every firefly episode . i loved firefly too !
17122,i never knew that . i 'm going to have to go watch and look for it .
17123,"yes , it was on the bridge console with the pilot . did you know that bill murray auditioned for the role of hans solo ?"
17124,wow . i never knew taht . that might have actually worker wit same of the funny comments that solo makes . i have to get running . nice chatting with you !
17125,will the star wars movies be culturally relevant in 200 years ? 1977 was a long time ago right now .
17126,"i think it will , there are any fans of the saga , h hopefully one day the old movies will be made ."
17127,lucas had a plan for the stories . i think teh disney takeover will cause some problems .
17128,"i think it will , they bought the franchise for a lot of moeny its now worth ike 65 billion"
17129,65 million is a lot . was lucas lucky or talented . i sa lucky in some way .
17130,"it is a lot of money , star was is greats ot only because o lucas bu this wife was a big influence on the franchise as well"
17131,20th century fox thought it would be a dud . lucas say able to secure the rights o licensing any merchandise . lucas becomes billionaire .
17132,"i heard about that , they have give r canoe to forgo hi directors fee , it wa about 500k , lucas made the right decision"
17133,"i guess you should always bet on your self . solo , a star was story was ok . but i think the film is at odds wit some of the other narrative previously established ."
17134,"valuable lesson , fox sure had it coming , so do you have a favorite star wars movie ?"
17135,"the empire stripes back i think . maybe the best is yet to come . given the movie solo , how could han have ever been a time lighter pilot ."
17136,i thought that polo movie was good but not as great at the other ones i liked the clone wars and the phantom menace
17137,rogue one was kind of refreshing . good scifi with not to crazy of a plot .
17138,"thats was a good one i also liked it , you know star wars holds a guinness world record for the most successful film merchandising film"
17139,i am sure disney will try hard to break that record . the toy industry gets involved before the beginning of filming now .
17140,"i more they are getting really involve in star wars , thy also own the franchise"
17141,i dont understand wreck i ralph . how could anything be in development that long ?
17142,maybe disney djt had much faith on the franchise i do like the movies and i hear the video game is great .
17143,store is a wreck it ralph game ? that would be merchandise before th movie .
17144,"yeah its originally a game i think , a really old arcade game , did you watch hate movie frozen ?"
17145,parts of frozen . olaf the snow man is funny .
17146,"yeah olaf is a fun one , col fact about the movie but its the firs animated disney film directed by a woman , anyway its been great chatting with you i think im going to watch a disney movie now ."
17147,"yep , time for some movies ."
17148,do you watch the academy awards ?
17149,i do ! the are also known as the oscars to many .
17150,i 'm quite surprised how many oscar eminem hows won
17151,he has more than johnny depp and will smith !
17152,that see crazy to me . they are such good actors .
17153,"they are , but the academy awards have been known to make questionable decisions . the oscars , itself , has been nominated fore emmys ."
17154,lol i would agree that they make questionable decisions for just about every award show . it is interesting that walt disney still holds the record for most awards under his in e .
17155,blazing saddles was nominated for 3 oscars . great comedy film .
17156,i have never seen taht movie before . i take it its worth the watch
17157,it is an amazing film and heady of sat lime .
17158,"ok i will have tow each it , wonder if its on netflix"
17159,"i am not sure , but you will easily be able to find it online , ."
17160,i had no idea how much moneys actors van make just for doing fan signings .
17161,they probably make so much money from hat .
17162,"i bet , can jist keep surviving off that"
17163,i wonder how much it oscar victory shapes public opinion about you
17164,"honest , i i do n't think much . people really do n't care"
17165,thats probably true . heir individual movie performance seems ton be a bigger indicator .
17166,yep . i think a lot of people do n't value awards anymore because they they do n't include all actors who deserve to be nominated .
17167,it 's so intriguing that eminem has so many oscar and emmy nominations .
17168,"i agree , it would n't think with some of the things he has about , he would be someone who would be nominated and win so many times ."
17169,it has been wonderful talking to you !
17170,it 's crazy to think that daniel daylewis has won best actor nice times .
17171,"i agree , i wonder which movies he wont hem for ."
17172,"hmmm , i think he won for lincoln for sure , and there will be blood . the later movie wa really good . i 'm not sure about the third one though ."
17173,"blazing saddles was nominated 3 times , i honestly have no idea what that movie is about . i guess i probably should check it out ."
17174,"it s absolutely hilarious . it 's not rene wilder , the dude who played willy wonka , . pretty much a 70s spoof on western movies ."
17175,"oh its a comedy , the i definately want to see it . i love comedy adn spoof movies . i also like science fiction . i ca n't believe some of the actors more so much money just from doing autograph signings"
17176,"yeah , nad on top of that , we think science fiction is super common today , but i guess that it 's only been mainstream for like 50 years thanks to stanley kubrick ."
17177,"i agree , i think a lot of people were like closet science fiction has , but now with all the different events and what not they are more comfortable expressing that . i mean some may the it to far with the whole membership for life that covers you in case you come back"
17178,"haha at lost they have all their basis covered . do you know any popular science fiction films tha ton oscars ? i know john williams won a bunch for opposing the star wars music , bu ti wonder if all of them won for best picture ?"
17179,"i honestly can say i do not remember a science fiction film winning an oscar for best picture . it usually is up be some dramatic m , movie or something . its possible the ay have won before my time , but i dont remember"
17180,"yeah , what 's you 're favorite scifi film ?"
17181,off the top of my head i ca n't think of one . i love movies dealing with aliens and such though . j also enjoy when teh sci fi has a little bit of a fear element 5o it . what i sour favorite
17182,"i like the fear lament too . normally , i 'm not too much into the alien or outer space movies , but i 've been usd into hte marvel movies lately . i ca n't get enough of them ."
17183,"i do enjoy them now 'll , i like new lot of the series they hav recreated too . sometimes though the storylines are a little too much ."
17184,"oh year , a lot of them are super unbelievable , even for the marvel universe . did you see that most recent avengers infinity war ?"
17185,i have n't yet but i really want to . i looks really awesome . did you see vita nd if sow as it good
17186,"yeah , i relaly liked it . it 's not your typical superhero movie or the typical ' hero 's path ' plot . it goes up and down the whole time , so it 's really entertaining . i think they have it on netflix now ."
17187,"oh awesome , i have netflix . i definitely will check it out . thank you for that info ."
17188,"not a problem , amy recent movies you 'd recommend me ?"
17189,"honesty as of lately the only movies i really saw were ballpark christmas movies , yes i am hat dorky that watches those lol"
17190,haha il love the cheesy christmas movies !

17196,"i thick it is late feb actually , and yes they give out likes 24 awards"
17197,"that 's so cool . i think i heard walt disney has received the most oscar nominations ou roof anyone , even . he once got a special oscar l for sow white , that was a statue of snow white and the seven dqwarves"
17198,"ye si stink you 're right , i also like blazing saddles it was nominated for 3 oscars"
17199,"i 've actually never seen blazing saddles , is it any good ? who 's in it ?"
17200,"yeah it 's good and it 's funny , not political correct thought ."
17201,"oh actually , i was thinking of brokebac mountain , way different , . i have seen blazing saddle s , i do n't remember it too well but i remember going it ! do you like sci fi movies ?"
17202,"i do like those movies , i like stuff like robots , cyborgs and space travel , you ?"
17203,"i love sci fi movies . i love the movie contact , which came out in 1997 . did you know that men in black , attack , the fifth element , and starship troopers all also came out in 1997"
17204,"wow that was a great year for movies , i think the landmark scifi movie was 201 by kubrick back kin 1968"
17205,"oh yeah , 2001 : a space odyssey . that was when the sci fi industry started to be taken seriously . and the one star wars came out , special effects really became popular an everyone went crazy over them"
17206,"ya yours right , cool that nasa named gat6aca as th most accurate sci fi film"
17207,"o hi did n't know that ! i did know that apparently the most e ' woman in the moon ' influenced nasa a little can that they use a similar ' countdown ' and a launch pad , more , and multistate orbital rockets . it 's so cool how sci fi films can be accurate"
17208,"i agree ! nasa also has a list of space accurate terms for movies to use , nasa is cool !"
17209,"yeah nasa is definitely really cool , i 'd love to learn more abou it . by the way , do you like tennis ? i used to play , but i was really bad haha"
17210,"ya i do i also used to play , i played in high school , you ?"
17211,"i like watching tennis now . i do n't know much about tennis k , but i kmnow a little about how grunting can give a tennis player ore power in their swing and actually some professionals consider it ' cheating ' !"
17212,"lol i did n't know that , crazy the longest tennis game was 11 hours taht exhausting"
17213,"that 's crazy ! the longest single point lasted almost 30 minutes . they just kept hitting the ball back and forth , back and forth , 643 times ! talk about exhausting . . ."
17214,"wow thats nuts ! an da the longest game at 11 hours was actually played rover 3 days , so even that is at least you ' r getting a break"
17215,"wow three days , one match . i do n't think i have he stamina for hat !"
17216,"i thnk my newt say i to own a house like the one he gibson is selling . : ,"
17217,just be nice to own something for 16 million . ocean view is a plus !
17218,i think the privacy piece is crucial too . and the two different swimming pools seem ideal .
17219,"wow l , sounding even better . gibson now is 62 and had started his career in australia and received his recognition for ' mad max ' in 1979 '"
17220,"in that case , i 've still got about 2 decades to catch up to where he 's at . maybe i can create the next fashion trend luke the tennis guy who invented polo shirts ."
17221,"if you are interested in acting , then perhaps you can get a start in ar couple like a detective . gibson gained greater recognition in the u . s . for his role as a detective in ' lethal weapon '"
17222,there we go . i can go down the acting route . then i can do tbh whole fan convention thing on the side as well .
17223,cool ! gibson did ahve a rebuild to his property after a fire in 1996
17224,i guess that ' the downside ton saving a multimilliondollar estate . you 're always worried about protecting it . maybe that explains the superfortifiex and boobytrtapped estate neat atlanta ?
17225,that i scary ! the aside of his house sounds exciting though . he has glass antique pocket doors that open out to the canyon nad ocean views below .
17226,meanwhile 8 've got standard windows that overlook . . . a busy a . and the neighbor 's house . pretty boring it comparison . no europeanimported elements or handheld wood flooding here .
17227,he seems green friendly too . he has working solar panels to supplement the electrical supply to the house .
17228,that 's pretty smart . i think a lot of uberrich people try to be able to set something up ' off the did ' . i wonder if duchovnyw as responsible for that like he did so many of the other improvements .
17229,maybe . do you follow te academy awards ? they are a set of 24 awards for artistic and technical merit in film
17230,not very much . i tend not to watch too many movies . but i did se same of the jimmy kimmel one last year . i wonder what films from 2018 will be big winners this arch .
17231,walt disney won a special oscar in 1938 for snow white . they made a statue that had one regular sized statute and seven miniature oscars
17232,"if anyone deserves a special oscar , it 's walt disney . or maybe georges relies . i learned more about his ' a trip to the moon ' from th movie hugo . so i guess i do watch some movies after ll ."
17233,it looks like john williams has the most nominations for oscars than anyone but disney
17234,"surprised by eminem 's success in the academy awards , too . well , now you 've got me interested i watching them thai year . nice talking to you !"
17235,"if you are interested in science fiction , you can look into the mit scifi club which has two memberships . they have a lifetime one nad one that is more expensive and covers you in case you die nad come back !"
17236,that is downright hilarious . what will those mit kids think up next ? take care .
17237,did you hear about north korea nd the olympics ?
17238,the winter olympics last year ? were n't the games in north korea ?
17239,"yes , they were in pyeongchang . the north koreans sent a cheer squad ."
17240,"i think it would be great if every country sent a cheer squad . i remember seeing some crowd pictures from london , 2012 ? , and they all looked bored . do you think it was a good squad ?"
17241,"i di now see it , although the cheer translated as merely ' go team ! '"
17242,sounds pretty tame . i would have hoped it would be more aggressive . it 's the olympics ! top of the world !
17243,are you a fan of hockey in the olympics ?
17244,"i like to , bey . its a fast game and a very athletic sport . i hear that players can lose several pounds in a game ."
17245,it amazes met hat a hockey player was once traded for a dollar
17246,he must have been worth less than taht to the trading team . made they were paying him too much already . do you play hockey ?
17247,"i do not , but many canadians do , since both hockey and lacrosse are their national sport t ."
17248,"what sports do you play ? i do n't play hockey or lacrosse , but i love soccer . i would like a cheer section like they have for club soccer ."
17249,"i p ; ay basketball , and have played on a court with a hockey rink under it !"
17250,ws it cold for your feet ?
17251,"yes , the floor was definitely colder than normal . they played a kanye west song during the game ."
17252,who game ? your basket ball games ?
17253,"yes . they played gold digger , which is odd to try and pen up the crowd with a song in a minor key ."
17254,what poes minor key mean ?
17255,music typically has upwards or downward sounding notes . they are often found kin gospel and hip hop .
17256,"and minor a would be donwward sounding ? yeah , that would be hard to play to . ad a hard cheer . . . even for a sad place like north korea . would you join a cheer squad if htey were a upbeat as the north koreans ?"
17257,"not sure . perhaps snl could do a skit mocking the situation , like they did with kanye west and taylor swift ."
17258,"oh , did they mock kanye for hte swift interruption ? i thought that was all before it happened . pretty funny to think back on , for sure ."
17259,"was . he believes aids in manmade , . anyway , i think i 'm going to go read this onion now ! have a great day !"
17260,"hi , do you like to fish or like aquariums ?"
17261,i love aquariums . did you know the black swallower fish cane at prey twice its own length and ten times its weight .
17262,nope . hat 's some appetite . fish are interesting . anything that cna have a drink through their skin ca n't be all bad .
17263,i know k i could watch them in aquariums all day . a seahorse has a neck . it is the only ; y fish with a neck .
17264,seahorses are coo ll 8 would go fishing f they had it on playstation . not much or hunting ' and fishing ' . . .
17265,"lol , me either . i saw that there wa sa breed of jellyfish that is immortal . i was i was , lol ."
17266,something that can sting you is also immortal . . . hmmm . i 'll stick to the land playing my playstation or nintendo . i may be able to do black hole research that say .
17267,i saw the 1760 playstation 3 's were used by the us department of defense to build a supercomputer becuase it was the most cost effective .
17268,"i bet cray was n't happy . wow , they could host quit epa gaming competition . they could play the gta theme nazi rock out ."
17269,that would be cool . they are even using ps3 's to research black holes .
17270,i wonder how that works . consoles have come a long way . nintendo started out in 1889 as selling playing cards .
17271,"they i ? ? ? well , the last game made for ps2 is fifa are , which is also the first game to span 3 console generations ."
17272,i do n't even know the rules for soccer . it 's all the same . my 12 year old son used to routinely beat me at everything .
17273,"lol , my son as well . did you nintendo i over 100 years old . it stated a a playing card company in 1889 ?"
17274,ye ; . thy also own hes seattle mariners . is that basketball ?
17275,"no , that is baseball . in 2001 , they released a handheld console for pokemon specifically ."
17276,so many gadgets or these things . playstation has something scalped a xrossmediabar . i 'm pretty sure you ca n't eat it .
17277,"i havent ' heard i that , but they became a video game company in the 70 ."
17278,i want think i heard of them until the 80s or even maybe the early 90s .
17279,same with m3 . i must have been 1 or so . nintendo is valued at over 85 billion
17280,"yep , i went into the wrong line of work . i am the tetrapods of gamers wb ye , nice talking to you ."
17281,"how are you ? do you play playstation ? they have released 4 consoles so far , all of which i have owned"
17282,"no , i d n't . i did n't know the was 4 ."
17283,"hs , and the first one was launched on 1994 in japan"
17284,they created a revolution that hows no signs of slowing down .
17285,"yep , the playstation 2 has sold over 155 million consoles making gift the bestselling console to date . i remember when it was out everyone had one"
17286,was it the first of it 's kind ?
17287,"in terms of selling consoles , ye abut the playstation 3 could n't live u to it and only sold 80 million consoles"
17288,have you ever played iheart : tales of broken wings ?
17289,"no , that system is that on ?"
17290,"playstation 4 , nintendo switch and mac ."
17291,"oh cool , i 'll go into that . did you know the u . s . department of defense used 160 playstation 3 's to build a supercomputer ?"
17292,"i had no idea , that is shave even interesting ."
17293,"yes , apparently using playstation 3 's were the cheapest option"
17294,do you like to discover that you 've been playing the game wrong or does it make you feel stupid ?
17295,"depends , if i 'm having fun i don ' g care but if i 'm sick andc frustrated ten i feel stupid"
17296,understandably . i did n't know here was an immortal jellyfish .
17297,"yea i read about he immortal jellyfish , i'ts bale to revert back to like an infant state and keep cycling through the life stages if the conditions are right"
17298,i wonder how old the oldest one is .
17299,"that be cool to find ou t , i 've read of sharks and whales that were like 300400 years old"
17300,i wonder if they 're studying the jellyfish to she if hey can discover how to keep humans alive longer .
17301,"it 's possible , they probably could test it out on the zebrafish which shares 84 percent of human genes associated with diseases"
17302,"yea , that 's amazing . i 'll bet they study this fish in relations to usa nd our diseases ."
17303,"yea it 's cool bengals . welp i gtg , nice talking with you !"
17304,nice talking with you aws well .
17305,peace bro
17306,"hi , how ar eyou doing there ?"
17307,pretty good . do you like fish ? did you know most fisk share coldblolded ?
17308,i like to eat fish . i it never had one as a pet . fish are not warm and friendly like puppies and sixties .
17309,"nope , especially the black swallower fish that an eat prey twice its length"
17310,i would love to have that ability . how many pizzas can i fit down my fullest ? let 's did out .
17311,"lol , the black swallower can also et pretyy 10x it weight , that does n't sound goo appealing"
17312,i figure i could plan ahead . maybe a long weekend . that would give me time to digest .
17313,"lol , did you know the seahorse is the only fish with a neck ?"
17314,i would think that the seahorse is unique fort hat face it has too . horsleik she unique . do you like to eat fish ?
17315,"yea when i could afford too . i would n't want to eat a zebrafish though , they share 84 percent of human disease associated genes"
17316,i think that the secret to cures might be found in te humbly zebrafish and is stripes hide .
17317,or the immortal breed of jellyfish
17318,"the jellyfish must lead a boring life . always f , outing bout , wondering about teh universe , watching reruns ."
17319,"yea it does sound bring . speaking of the universe , playstation 3 's are being used to research black holes"
17320,the ps3 is a good way to earn about the cosmos . i figure that a bunch of those together could unlock the secret of life .
17321,"yea , t hey make good supercomputers , th department of defense used 1760 of them for that"
17322,that is insane . i wonder how they got the money for that . ' we need ps3s for . . . . research . black hole . . . research . yeah . '
17323,too they id n't buy any nintendos . back in 2001 nintendo released a handheld console specifically for pokemon
17324,"i trunk that the pokemon craze pas see by and that 's a good thing . anyway , great chat !"

17331,"oh , okay . thats ' a little intersting . i have been all caught isp in iheart and the way i was playing it wrong l fortunately , i have be introduced to step to correct my strategy ."
17332,"speaking off do games , did you know ps3 's are being used to study the black holes ?"
17333,"no , that is totally weird . i can not imagine how they are doing that but believe inn past and their abilities ! wow"
17334,i know that is insane where technology is going the days
17335,i know that the department of defense used playstations 3 's to build a supercomputer ! i guess it was cheaper than starting from scratch . that is wild .
17336,yeah hat is much cheaper i bet . have you ever played grand theft auto ?
17337,"no i have no played that one . i did hear that when placed on a cd player it would play the soundtrack , thats some special secret trick . lol"
17338,"yeah sad is so cool . how about nintendo , do you play tat ?"
17339,i am a huge fan . i started playing the handheld console in 2001 because i like pokemon and that is in they came out with the handheld . it was specifically for pokemon originally .
17340,nice i like it too . did you know it was founded in 1889 as a playing card company
17341,"yeah , i did not know it was that old . did you"
17342,yeah i did not know but apparently it has been that long
17343,"cool , i found out nintendo produced a knockoff lego when they were a toy company ."
17344,"wow , and they own the seattle mariners"
17345,"man , that is aw aide range of companies and interest ! i heard you could order food directly to your seat through an app too ."
17346,"are you kidding me , that is insane . wow"
17347,"yeah , the technology out there is really beyond what i an imagine . nitnendro is japan 's most third valued company . or 85 million ."
17348,"that is a lot of money but yeah , it so everywhere now so that makes sense . nice hat : ,"
17349,have you ever heard of it play ? i guess it 'd a wapo column that helps people get dates ?
17350,that sounds cool . sounds like they have had some matches .
17351,i woul imagine . first dates can be so awkward . it rarely becomes a ' lady and the team ' thing .
17352,yes . do you like music ? did you know steven spielberg played clarinet on teh jaws soundtrack ?
17353,"yes nd no , i hd no idea he played anything . i did like the music in the , movie ' o ' brother where art tho ' ."
17354,hat went platinum did n't it ? i like drake but did not realize he graduated high school at 25
17355,"yes . i 'm so out of it . to me , drake iss til la duck . i do date and i like it to end with a hug regardless ."
17356,and a concert is a good date i think . you know when drake went to drake university he did it in the middle of the night .
17357,i 'm just not into rap ; . to me it 's usually very bad and profile poetry set to a wlelworn backbeat . it is impressive the drake was determine typo finishes hs .
17358,i like old rap the new rap is hard to understand .
17359,i think kanye west is hard to understand . he thinks aids is a manmade disease ? wow .
17360,i think kanye west has been differnt since he married kim kardashian . the song golddigger is a minor key
17361,yah but it seems she already ahs the gold . i think stat whole kardashian thing is weird .
17362,yes ws reg ot famous fro ma sex tape . some musicians are smart . big sean had a 3 . 7 gpa and turned down a scholarship to be signed to kanyes label
17363,i wonder what the major was . a 3 . 7 in physics is n't the same as a 3 . 7 in music appreciation . i thinks it 's good at kanye west can make fun of himself on snl .
17364,"yes , but he cna eb arrogant sometimes . i still do n't understnad his relationship with donald trump ."
17365,that is bizarre . . . i think he 'll do anything to get his face in tune limelight . like the interrupting thing the did to taylor swift .
17366,ad that as not even about him . he felt beyonce should have won . i think it was nice of him o give his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at his concert . taht shows the good side of him .
17367,"yeah , that 's cool . i would say to kayne what one would say to a child about the interrupting thing . what if everyone did that when they did n't get their wa ?"
17368,kanye west was upset after hearing eminem verse on drakes labour so he took two days and cancelled his appointments to rewrite his
17369,sounds like he has a lot of attention to detail . you ; v been an excellent cha partner . thanks .
17370,you too
17371,bye .
17372,"how 's it going , did you know speilberg places the clarinet on jaws soundtrack ? he ' really talented"
17373,i did n't know that . how interesting . that was such a relic soundtrack !
17374,"yea , i hear o brother , where art though ? soundtrack was really good , it was certified 8 times platinum"
17375,that was a great song . im going to have that song i ny head now . lol do you lke daft puns ?
17376,yea daft punk is cool and they did a great job with the tron legacy soundtrack
17377,"i agree ! i was gong to mention that . phil collins recorded the english , italian , german , spanish , and french version of the tarzan sountrack . that 's pretty incredible !"
17378,"it is pretty cool , so are the names on the batman begins soundtrack that are form names of bat genus"
17379,wow . i never though of that but yu 're right ! do you like kanye west ?
17380,"i liked his first albums and gold singer was a good song , it 's the only top 10 hit kayne id in minor key"
17381,i did n't know that . i never seen his snl skit where he mocked himself for interrupting award shows . hav eyou seen it ?
17382,no but i did see a video of kayne giving his mic to a fan in a wheel chair before
17383,that was pretty cool of him to do that . sometimes he ha some different views on things . like for example he believes hat aids is a manmade disease .
17384,maybe big sean and explain that to him since he had a 3 . 7 gpa before signing with kayne
17385,nice gpa ! are you familiar with drake ?
17386,"somewhat , i know he 's a rapper and was in degrassi"
17387,once . he graduated high school at the age of 25 in 2012 . he must have quit and went back ?
17388,"i guess so , most people graduate copllevw before 25 , not high school like rake"
17389,hahahaha his debut studio album thank me later was released in 2010 and debuted at number 1 .
17390,nice . kayne west took 2 days to rewrite his verse on forever after he heard eminems
17391,nic e ! i remember his debut the college dropout that cam but in 2004 . it was a hue success nd put him on the map .
17392,wel i hve to go . nice talking with you
17393,i like when different races date and learn about each other . i think people should be open to this more often . this couple seems like there would work
17394,yeah that was a insteresting story . do you listen to music ? specifically kanye west or drake ?
17395,"yes i like kayne west , he seems like he tends if or what he believed in . he also seems like a nice guy . i heard he even helps people and gives to his fans as much as he can . i think eh does movie soundtracks"
17396,sure that sounds all good on paper lol but he has been acting crazy for while now . he got son all these uncalled gore rants . i am definitely not a fan of his and hs music isnt even that good and he always claims to eb the best rapper veer .
17397,"well i woudl go back and take a look at hid work , he has has lots of hits . he has some of the most popular songs ever like his song gold digger . he also is very creative . i think he just feel that democrats have not done enough in 30 years and they are in blacks to that elected ."
17398,"what is just my opinion of him , i do not like him and i personally do not find his music good regardless of how much its he has . they do ot sound good at all to me ."
17399,"i am not a huge fan , i like techno and alternative rick more . i also like movie soundtracks like jaws and movies with dramatic cool sounds like batman . kanye could do movie soundtracks and impress people ."
17400,it recently learned that michael hickson helped with the sonic 3 soundtrack .
17401,"that is amazing , i think music can make a movie or game much more memorable . they have coo , soundtracks on spotify , i even hear you can create custom playlist"
17402,alicia keys was only 16 when he recorded the men in black sountrack .
17403,"that amazing , i heard that daft punk got the rights to do the tron movie ; they did it in exchange for pancakes . yumm !"
17404,that is interesting . the must really like pancakes .
17405,it would be cool 83 drake did songs for movies . i heard he is a big fan of winnie the pooh books . most people do not know eh collects them . he sound do a movie and make a gangster pooh
17406,i didnt know he appeared in justin biebers video ' baby '
17407,yea drake is very soft nd sensitive . when he did a song with medium he had to change his because he thought eminems part was better .
17408,how does hat show he is soft and sensitive ? be probably just wanted his perry to sound as good as eminems
17409,a rapper being in justin bieber videos us soft in my book . plug what grown mad collects while the pooh books . he also was n a teen show called degrassi .
17410,"lol k . that video is pretty good , maybe he wa just getting noticed an damaging appearances , doesnt really mean he is soft and sensitive . winnie the pooh books are classics , they will probably be worth a lot in the future . ."
17411,his dance moves re very girly also . if you . him dance in his video hot line bling you will know . he got a grammy for that song .
17412,"i have seen that video . i dont think that his dancing is girly , just a different style . but i do not like that song , it doesnt sound good to e ."
17413,"do you like his song gods plan , i heard it broke streaming records . that sad is pretty good ."
17414,do you enjoy music ?
17415,"i do , but i dont et go spend as much time listening as j might like . you ?"
17416,lately i have been trying to move away from soundtrack and instrumental to more lyric artists .
17417,i thin the last soundtrack i bought was guardian 's of the galaxy to my kid
17418,did you know each soundtrack of batman begins is named after a genus of bats ?
17419,"that 's really cool ! i had the original batman soundtrack years ago , but none of the more recent ones . dig suess steven spielberg played ts declaring themself on the jaws soundtrack ."
17420,i sure do enjoy it when directors play a direct part in their creations
17421,"lol yeah . everybody says the o brother where art thou soundtrack is great , but i have n't hear do . i think george clooney is on it ."
17422,so is their ay musicians you follow ?
17423,no but my son is a huge fan of am . i think he bought a drake album recently . brakes song hotline bling is sampled from the 1972 song why we ca n't live together rye everything old is new again !
17424,ah drake is a recognized choice . surprisingly he gain initial fame for being a actor on degrassi rather than as a musician .
17425,"wow i did n't know hat ! weird that he was on a show about a high school , since he is n't graduate until he was 25 years old !"
17426,i guess he was a perfect fit sick he was in high school during the show ?
17427,"dig unless so . his 4th album , views , broke a lot of records , like it was in the top 100 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks . i guess he was n't he toby finishing school so late !"
17428,"well now that he is so successful he is spending firt on som odd things , like first edition children 's books"
17429,"oh yes , i beard he bought copies of charlotte 's web and winnie the pooh in the uk ;"
17430,"in any case , how about kanye west ?"
17431,he seems like kind of a weird guy to me . he says aids is a manmade conspiracy disease .
17432,i hope he does n't think vaccines douse autism
17433,oh god i hope not ! here are people who will listen because hit 's a celebrity . shakes head and rolls eyes i hear his music is good though . i have o admit i have n't checked it out .
17434,"i usually listen tow hat musicians say for musi and what doctors say for medicine . i do n't trust most musicians to tell me how to treat my any . in any have , i had a wonderful tim chatting with you and i personally think his music is great , though some of his though are n't as much"
17435,cool . nice to talk to yu !
17436,have a nice day .
17437,hi do you like astronomy ?
17438,"its very interesting , but ones is the first time i have read about the ganymede being so large"
17439,that woul be jupiter 's moon ? i wonder if jupiter is one of the five planets visible to the naked eye .
17440,i would guess from it size it is
17441,th e0lanef venu is the only planet that rotates clockwise and has no seasons . that seems blowing .
17442,"uranus also has a strange rotation , it rolls around rather than spinning"
17443,that is unique . i think mars sounds like w weird planet . it is called dread planet the named for the roman god of war .
17444,yes it was because of the iron oxide
17445,mars i salsa cosnideresd a terrestrial planet and the fourth planet frost he sun . must be hot there .
17446,nut it hoax polar icecaps like us
17447,true and valleys and deserts s maybe it is pretty diverse . it is the second smallest planet in the solar system .
17448,i did not know wifi was a byproduct from astronomy
17449,that is pretty neat . i did n't either . the town of saadat ahh rain iran u socalled the astronomy town and even bought an observatory . on special occasions the turn off all lighted to improve the view of th night sky .
17450,i wonder what would people would say if we did that to an american town
17451,people would probably like it . did you know mercury was the smallest planet ?
17452,"yes i did ,"
17453,would you1 e interested in the mars colonization project planned for 2023 ? i guess it will be a reality tv show .
17454,"it would be cool , i did not know plato like lichens could lived there already ."
17455,yeah i think it sounds cool as well . it would take 2 or 3 day too get there one constant 1g acceleration . that 's a bit long !
17456,it seems long
17457,well it 's been nice chatting . maybe i 'll see you on that trip to mars . lol !
17458,one day bye
17459,have a nice day .
17460,good evening ! are you into astronomy ? rid you know that venus has no seasons because it does n't tilt ?
17461,i enjoy learning about it . hat is interesting abut venus . our solar system is pretty east
17462,t is ! did you know that there is a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph in 200 degree fahrenheit weather . it sounds fascinating .
17463,wow ! it also sounds dangerous ! how about the fact that all of the planets woudl fit tween the earth and our moon ?
17464,yes ! fascinating . and precursor to life have been discovered in a plnaetatry system about 455 light years away .
17465,i wonder how they determine hat ? that seems like a microscopic issue rather than a telescope one .
17466,"yes , i would like to know . i 've been reading about observational versus theoretical astronomy , but i do n't know what research methods would have been used to detects he building blocks of life so far away ."
17467,can you imagine how complex the orbit world be for that planet that orbits four stars ?
17468,i have n't heard of that planet ! what is it called ?
17469,"that was all k read about it . however , hte math that describes orbiting one stab is complex enough . the math souls b crazy ."
17470,yes ! did you know that planet where refined in 2006 by the astronomical union ? it 's been controversial . the definition is based on where an object orbits add regards its mass .
17471,i suppose that is why pluto was downgraded . i wonder how the chinese are controlling heir rover on the dark side of the moon with snow .
17472,"yes , i wonder . ceres , pallas , juno nd vesta were also once considered planets and then downgraded ."
17473,mankind has studied astronomy per a long time . ? even the vatican ha an observatory for studying i t .
17474,yes ! and the ancient babylonians too !
17475,"harlow sharply , a noted astronomer decided to study it because it was the first subject in the house catalog at college . strained world we have in ."
17476,"yes , and a byproduct of astronomical research led to the development of wifi . had you heard that ?"
17477,no . but i am old enough to remember felon being a byproduct of space exploration by the usa .
17478,fascinating ! i was not aware of that . did you know that sounds are higher pitched on mars because of atmospheric differences ?
17479,no . but it makes sense . sound is different in water here on earth . i also read of a town in iran that is so much into astronomy that they shut the lights down on occasion to improve the new of the night sky .
17480,"wow ! that would be a fun place to visit . well , it 's been good talking to you ! have a wonderful evening !"
17481,deadpool 2 is an that movie ! ! !
17482,i agree . ryan reynolds i soso fun in it
17483,"he , is i think h nailed she role and well the movie has a pretty good cast as well"
17484,"yeah . did hyou know deadpool described himself as ryan reynolds with a sharply , before ryan was even cast ?"
17485,"really ? that is an interesting fact , another cool fact is that 'the video game cost more to make than the movie"
17486,wow . apparently he voice of the mystery villain is ryan as well
17487,you know deadpool is te highest grossing r rated film to have a different director than cameron or lucas ! !
17488,"i did not know that , quite something . speaking ot superheroes , do you like marvel comics ?"
17489,"i do , some of my favorite heroes , from team travel comics universe , i 've love the movies"
17490,did you know they offered the right to sony for all superheroes and they only bought sony ?
17491,"i heard they bough spiderman and i used to like the old spiderman movies with good maguire as the star , he was a good spiderman"
17492,"yeah i wi , l agree with that , for sure . the should have bought the rest when they had a chance"
17493,"i agree , considering now they are worth billions , that sure was a poor investment decision , t he one are also pretty good , i like them"
17494,did you know marvel successfully argued j court that mutants in xmen are not humans ?
17495,i didnt and did shinning that argument helped them in a way ?
17496,"yeah it did actually , they paid the lower rate on toys"
17497,"oh i see im guessing thats made them billions ten , wonder woman is cast a great film , have you watched the one"
17498,yeah i have i really loved it and looking forward to the second one . you ?
17499,"i did , i thought it was a decent film and will watch the second one for sure , it generated a lot of money"
17500,yeah it is the highest grossing superhero origin movie
17501,"and las highest grossing wwi movie , i gues wonde roman has a lo of fans ."
17502,hi . do you like superheroes ? i really like wonder woman and the film they made based off of her in 2017 .
17503,"some of take . i have n't seen wonder woman yet . i guess i should , it is he top grossing movie for ww i movie ."
17504,it was really good and the lead actress gal gadot did a fantastic job . it could be because he served two years as a soldier in the israel defense forces .
17505,that would be good grew . she did n't even realize she was auditioning for taht bet ! i love to hear stuff like that !
17506,i like how far wonder woman 's character has come . when she first appeared in 1941 the group made her their secretary .
17507,it us good for some too . 2017 was the 1st year since 1958 thati e top 3 richest grossing movies were female led .
17508,taht is so cool . comic book movies are really successful but i guess it was n't always that way . un 1998 marvel offered sonny almost all of its characters fdr 25 million but they rejected because they only wanted spiderman for 10 million .
17509,it seems like thet have really taken of lately . marvel created a character named bue ear for a 6yearold boy that had hearing problems . that was cool .
17510,that is so kind . and it started because he did not want to wear his hearing aids and told his mother ' super heroes dont wear hearing it ' so marvel created one .
17511,very cool . did you know there is one character owned by both marvel and dc that is designed to keep the companies ' universes separate ?
17512,leave it up to big business to find a way to veep their investment safe ? . it is interestin tthat disney does not own the rights to bi marvel characters east of the mississippi due to contract with universal studios .
17513,i guess one work need to be a lawyer to understand the mississippi thing . i you likd either of the dead poo movies . funny dark humor . . .
17514,i only aw tune first one not the second ut i think i should . it is teh highest grossing r rated film not directed by james cqmsroln or george lucas .
17515,i guess it cost more to make the video game gran the 1st movie . sw development wise expensive !
17516,"what is nice is even though it is competition for directors like james cameron , he read the script and champions the film to fox executives ."
17517,good for hi . it is true that people get used to one particular actor doing superheroes . i a n't imagine anyone but reynolds doing deadpool . . .
17518,what is odd is that the comic book series in 2004 had deadpool describe himself as ' ryan reynolds crossed with a shar he ' so ryan reynolds believed he wa destined fo 'the roped .
17519,it seems that is true . he has that personality . downey is another one for iron man .
17520,i think the same thing about hugh jackman as wolverine but the director knew him as musical theater australian unknown actor .
17521,interesting . i guess they case could vr made for gal gadot for wonder woman .
17522,some people are just born to play the role . well thank you for swatting . i learned al ot of ne wand fun information today .
17523,hello have you seen deadpool 2 ? ?
17524,"i have n't seen it yet , did you ? i am a pretty big fan of the marvel comics universe though ."
17525,"yeah i have seen it , it was really good and funny ."
17526,how was ryan reynolds ? he 's carved out a pretty iconic roll for himself as deadpool and was great in the first one .
17527,"oh yeah , for sure , he was perfect for this role . did you know in the 2004 comic deadpool describes himself as a ' ryan reynold switch a sharply ' which had ryan to believe he was destined for ther ole lol"
17528,"no , that 's awesome though . did you know james cameron and david fischer were involved in pushing for deadpool 2 to be made . two pretty big names right there ."
17529,wow that i awesome . thats pretty funny that the deadpool videogame cost more to make than the movie . lol i never layed they game .
17530,are you a fan of one the other marvel characters or movies ? its lee 's estate must hard been very valuable .
17531,"yeh i love all of them , i guess if id have to pick , or really like actor , guardians of the galaxy and avengers . how about u ?"
17532,9 'm a big fan or thor . i thought ragnarok was the best marvel movie . chris hemsworth is awesome as thor . they probably could n't have picked anyone better .
17533,right ! thor ragnarok was hilarious ! that was the best of the thors .
17534,it 's funny back in 1998 sony could have bough all cinematic rights for marvel for 25 million but they decided rejected hte offer . i bet they wish they did n't .
17535,"i know right , this couldve even big awhile ago , but i guess they only wanted spiderman ."
17536,"yeah , crazy . oops . did you know there 's a character owned by both marvel and dc ?"
17537,"no , who is it ?"
17538,"it 's this character called access . it 's kind of weird , his sole purpose is to keep the marvel and dc separate universe separate from each other ."
17539,"thats cool , i wonder if they will make a movie about him , since both dc and marvel have a ton of movies and tv shows out now ."
17540,i do n't think so . do you like any of the dc miss ? i heard wonder woman was good but did n't see it .
17541,"yeah wonder woman was great , i think the second one is coming out soon , th newer superfans with henry cavill are good , i like the batman series too , and the tv show the flash . arrow was good but hes sod ark , i only have room for one dark super hero and i like batman lol"
17542,"cool , how did you like gal gadot as wondr woman ?"
17543,"she is awesome , really great actress , i liked her in fast n furious series . she also served in the israeli army . well i believe everyone in isreal as tp serve its a law"
17544,i did n't even know she was in the fast n furious series . i remember the classic linda carter wonder woman too . do you ?
17545,no i don ? 'd think i ever watched the older wonder woman . yeah she plays giselle i fast n furious .
17546,"i remember army parents used to have it on every once in a while e , it was pretty good . i should check south the new movie . ca n't believe marvel started in 1939 ."
17547,"i kno wright , its been awhile ! its been fun chatting ."
17548,"hi k , homo are you ?"
17549,"helo , doing great ! you ? are you interested in astronomy ?"
17550,sure . i do n't know much about it . what about you ?
17551,"i 'm impartial bu ti am surprised by a couple of facts in my reading , like when september ends , the planet is even brighter than in previous months ."
17552,people have been watching th nessie forever . ancient babylonians ha d were able veto track plants such a jupiter with matyhmeatical precision . nowadays we 're pretty disconnected from the solar system .
17553,"yes and without special equipment , only five planets in the solar system are visible to th naked eye ."
17554,the tech for viewing planets has had benefit in outer arenas . a critical step in creation of wifi was a byproduct of research into improving astronomy
17555,"that information gained can also be compiled to produce sounds and songs that illustrated what sp ; ace is like for visually impaired individuals , that 's pretty neat !"
17556,would you want to live on mars ? a mars colonization project is planned for 2023 .
17557,"i 'm not sure , but if i did , i do n't think i want to be one of the first ones on there . do you ? an so you think colonization on mates by 2023 is feasible ?"
17558,"no , not realy . flying to mars under constant 1g accelaration takes only 2 or 3 days . bu to we have tech like this ?"
17559,"i 'm not sur and even if there is tech taht is capable of that , do humans survive that at those speeds ? it 'll be pretty neat to see ther sunset on mars though , because it is blue ."
17560,"i guess that 's because the atmosphere is different . i do n't know waht kinds nfl life its can support , but there is an atmosphere e ."
17561,"yes , i think i 'd like to visit the saadat shahr astronomy town ' because the residents have a strong passion for stargazing , so that 's what the small stargazing community is called ."
17562,i wonder if they 'll fin da planet that can support life . astronomers have already detected building blocks of life in a planetary system 455 lightyears from us .
17563,"i think we wil , or made the movie with matt damon really convinced me , i forgot what it was called ."
17564,"i do n't remember either . i think that its expensive . high risk . probably better to invest in better ways to live on this planet , the one we 're designed for ."
17565,i agree but i must say that human perception of the planets have hcanbged as scientific knowledge advanced . i wonder how older generations of people feel about th esoalr system knowing what we know today .
17566,they feel the way that the younger generations will in 40 years . astonished about how much has been learned and our tiny place in the universe . i enjoyed chatting with you !
17567,"yes , same here ! have a great day !"
17568,thanks !
17569,"hey there , do you like superhero movies ?"
17570,"yes , i like superhero movies . do you ?"
17571,"yes , i do . do you uav epa favorite publishing company that is in charge of superhero movies and such ?"
17572,"yes , i do . y favorite publishing company associate with superhero movies is marvel . what 's your favorite publishing company ?"
17573,slave here ; . so you have a favorite superhero ?
17574,yes i do . my favorite superhero is batman . who is your favorite superhero ?
17575,"i am going to go with the classic i think , supemrah . apparently spiderman is the only big superhero owned bey sony"
17576,"i like superman . yes , spiderman got he only bugs superhero owned by sony , in partnership with marvel studios ."
17577,have you ever heard of the character access
17578,"no , i have n't heard of access . what kind of superhero is taht ?"
17579,it is character whos main power is so veep marvel and dc separate from each other and is owned by both studios
17580,interesting ! i like hte concert of that character . which studio do you prefer : marvel or dc ?
17581,"i am not sure , i do n't pay much attention to studies as i do to the movie the make . marvel did create a special superhero for a little boy though"
17582,which superhero didt hey create for the little boy ?
17583,it is called blue ear because the litle boy was hard of hearing
17584,"that is heartwarming . did you know that marvel claimed in court that since mutants are n't people , they should pay the lower rate on xmen toys . because they 're not considered human , so they do n't qualify az dolls ."
17585,their must have had some really good lawyers . dod you every wathc wonder woman ?
17586,"yes , i have watched wonder woman . did you know gal gadot fought in the israeli specials forces ?"
17587,"i think tha ticks why theyd aired her , she had the skills she thought she was testing for catwoman not wonder woman"
17588,i am surprised to hear that . i thought auditions were more straightforward . i imagine it was a surprise for her to lion out the truth !
17589,"yeah , well she did well . good for her . i mean wonder woman is the highest grossing superhero origin movie"
17590,"yes , it is . that makes me happy . i am glad wonder woman did so well in theaters . did you see the movie ?"
17591,i did it wass o good . and apparently it is also the highest grossing wwi movie too
17592,"yes , it is . that is good . well , it was nice talking with you !"
17593,same there . have a good one .
17594,hello ! how are you ?
17595,i am good ! currently fascinated about mars . hat avant you ?
17596,i 'm good s well ! mars is so crazy tense days huh ?
17597,yes ! have you heard about the sound on mars ?
17598,do n't they have a higher pitch than sounds one garth ?
17599,"yes , due to differences in atmosphere , sounds on mars have a higher pitch than they do on earth ."
17600,that is so cool ! can you belive now they are trying to fund a maps colonization project by 2023 ?
17601,that is crazy . do you know now they are going to fund it ;
17602,by creating a reality tv show . hmmm . . . .
17603,i wonder waht that reality tv sow will be about . i love reality tv so i will probably watch it regardless .
17604,"oh see , i 'm the complete opposite o tthat one aha . do you know how long it would a to get to mars ?"
17605,if you fly to mar under constant 1g acceleration it will only take 2 or 3 days . i thought it took a lo longer .
17606,"me too ! movies make them seem longer , but they might be going much much slower for airtime lol ."
17607,that is true . have you heard about the lost satellite ron marx ?
17608,did n't lockheed martin pose on somehow ?
17609,"yes , locheed martin used the imperial system while nasa used he metric system ."
17610,oh boy ho funny ! can you imagine if earth had shard of glass that precipitate sideways at 4500 mph ?
17611,that would be terrifying . especially because they are in 2000 degree fahrenheit weather .
17612,we would probably have some great and on what planet haha .
17613,very true . i wonder how scientists even measured that .
17614,"good question ! anyways , had a great chat wit hyou , have an awesome day !"
17615,did you hear the elmo is the only nonhuman to testify before the us congress ?
17616,i did hear that . i also heard that are three subways to transport staff between the capital and their offices .
17617,wow did you know that they have fantasy congress ?
17618,they slow have a baseball game thatd attends back to 1909 .
17619,wow i never know that . are you a star wars fan n ?
17620,i am a fan . are yu ?
17621,"ye indeed george is a genius , do n't you think ?"
17622,"i do , both creatively lane financially !"
17623,the first one was in hte 70 's and it was the last street in the series that he released .
17624,the first 8 films were nominated for academy awards and a combined box office ot 8 . 5 !
17625,yeah and his name is still lavigne on long after he 's gone . at what legacy is all about !
17626,i read his exwife has done a ; ot for the movies too . the even killed obi wan !
17627,"you gt to feral me in on that one . i like the video games a swell . the new one are n't as good bu still good enough , the movies i mean ."
17628,"it was her idea to kill off obi wan , leia 's ancestral good luck kiss and make the trench run more tension filled ."
17629,ww now that 's drama . james earl jones spent 2 . 5 hours only recording all of darth vader lines for 7 a 00 .
17630,"if only he knew what that would do , he would have demanded more . or if he was paid by the hour , at least talk slower ."
17631,right but i'n sure that was a lot of money back then .
17632,not if all 8 of them made 8 . 5 in total box office ! that 's a small percent for a main character !
17633,"7 . 500 for two ours of work will work for me my friend , l ol . astronauts in a space suit can not whistle ."
17634,"yes , i would definitely take it . why cant they whistle ?"
17635,"i have know idea just a known fact . better question s why would they want to in that suit , lol . apparently there is a water cloud in space that hold 100 trillion times the amount of water on earth ."
17636,there 's a lot of questions there ! maybe for our next chat . have a great today !
17637,hello . do you like information about space ?
17638,absolutely ! what do you know about space ?
17639,i find it interesting that astronauts can not whistle in a space suit .
17640,that is interesting . i wonder what prevents that from happening .
17641,me too . thy also touch helmets on space walks when they wat to talk in private . that 's pretty neat .
17642,so they just walk up to each other and bump helmets real quick ?
17643,"yes , i believe so . are you a star wars fan"
17644,i have actually only seen the first film but i am a huge fan of carrie fisher sr ip .
17645,i may have seen one a very long time go . fox did not think it would succeed so they told george lucas if he directed it eh would get all merchandising right to himself . he must have made a fortune .
17646,oh i actually knew that about the films ! h e definitely mad in fortune . they thought tha 'the entire franchise would never have any money especially when it came to toys and ca . i bet hey regret every bit o tthat lol
17647,"yes , an his wife marcia was the reason they made all the goo changes . she even won an award for it ."
17648,god changes in regards to what ?
17649,"well the good luck kiss with leia , obi wan dying"
17650,i have already forgotten bout all of this .
17651,some things are really interesting . i do n't know why i never watch more than the first one . did you know in 2013 it was dubbed in navajo . it was the first movie ever dubbed in the native american language
17652,wow . star war really is a historical movie in pop culture . i had no idea they did that . 2013 was not very long ago either .
17653,no and another cool thing is james earl jones only spent two and a half hours recording darth vaders lines . does n't he do cell phone commercial too .
17654,i am not sure waht he does . james earl jones was also mufasa in too lion king i think ? i think he will be in the remake too .
17655,cool . good chatting with you
17656,ham do you !
17657,same here
17658,are you a star wars fan ?
17659,yes i personally love star wars . george lucas is a visionary for creating it .
17660,"for sure , stars wars made him a billionaire !"
17661,no doubt tc the firs tight films were nominated for academy awards and also commercially successful .
17662,"wow , i think george lucas ' wife got an oscar or editing for the films"
17663,yeah it sounds likes he was the major reason for making cages to the original film .
17664,i wonder if it was for the good or for the bad lol
17665,yes i would like to know that as well ! i think it 's so cool that george lucas was able to keep licensing and merchandising rights fo them self . it really paid off !
17666,"forms sure , he would not be worth nearly as much as he is now . did you ever hear how much james earl jones was paid for his voice"
17667,"i last do n't believe this number but he was only paid 7500 , can you belive that ?"
17668,"i believe that , that would ve like 3000 dollars per hour i bet lol . i am hoping he made more after the first movie"
17669,yeah i am sure he did . in 2013 star wars was dubbed in navajo making at the first major film to be dubbed in a native american language .
17670,"that is awesome that they did that , but was there really that much of a demand for that ?"
17671,yeah i 'm not sure it right just be more symbolic than anything . both i love how the film is set in space . it is such a interestin concept .
17672,"for sure , it was out of this world at the time , no pun intended lol . space is so mythical"
17673,"ba ha it really is . i would really love to go to space . but apparently astronauts in space suit cant white , i wonder why ?"
17674,"i could n't whistle and i was n't even ins pace lol ! i wonder why too , maybe the no gravity marks it impossible"
17675,haha ! yes perhaps . if astronauts out on a spacewalk wanted to talk in private they would touch helmets . good to know .
17676,"lol , , tha i awesome , secret code is the best ! it was so nice chatting with you !"
17677,new it is ! astronauts even got free corvettes back in the day ! s o nice talking with you too . bye !
17678,"i want a corvette , lol . have a great weekend !"
17679,hi how are you today ?
17680,hello i a good . how are you ?
17681,great ! enjoying this snow day here in new jersey ! are you into politics at all ?
17682,oh wow that 's awesome . it 's just raining here . i 'm in ohio . i 'm not huge into politics . what about you ?
17683,not really . i did not know that hilary was president o young republicans in college . makes sense though .
17684,"oh wow i did n't know that either . i do support trump though . i think ge 's a little hot headed , but doing good things so far ."
17685,i do not support him but i think he could b doing worse . i think kanye should run for president in the next election .
17686,lol the would be funny to have kanye un for president . he 's a huge trump supporter .
17687,did you know kanye believes aids is a man named seas ?
17688,have yea i saw that one time . he says one really weird things at times .
17689,he also once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair during a concert . i guess he has some and in him .
17690,that 's good . i saw one time when he stole the mic from taylor swift . it was a pretty low move on is .
17691,yea i think i remember that . poor taylor swift .
17692,yea it was no ta cool move to do . i saw that rapper dig sean ad a gpa of 3 . 7 and turned down a scholarship in michigan .
17693,that is impressive . i have been to a big sean convert twice !
17694,oh wo that 's cool . how was the concert ?
17695,great ! he is very talented q better than kanye in my opinion . kanye once did a snl skit mocking himself for interrupting award shows !
17696,"i 'm not a huge fan of kanye music ,"
17697,"me neither , his only song gold digger was in the top ten songs of all time ."
17698,i do n't think i 've heard that song before .
17699,that was the only song i really ever like from him .
17700,it was good talking to you !
17701,did you know that hillary clinton was president of young republicans in college ?
17702,"no , but i 'm not surprised ."
17703,apparently she adopts a southern drawl when campaigning in southern states .
17704,that i did know . what i did n't know was that taylor swift him taller than kanye .
17705,"kanye is an interesting character . he 'll , thieves that aids is a man mad disease ."
17706,"i know , i did n't know taht evel knievel sued im though ."
17707,do you know what he was sued for ?
17708,damage to his reputation from ' touch the sky '
17709,kanye can be nice sometimes . he once gave a mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert .
17710,"i head about that , i did n't now he was 41 though ."
17711,"well , he has accomplished a lot in those years , and has been responsible for cultural movements and progression within hip hop ."
17712,i did n't know that he incorporated gospel in some of his songs .
17713,that 's cool . i also liek how eclectic his music is .
17714,"yeah , i do too . it is pretty interesting ."
17715,"do you1 ike music in the minor key ? one of kanye 's most successful songs , gold digger , is in the minor key ."
17716,"i actually play a lot of music . i hear that kayne barely plays in minor keys , sort of surprising to me ."
17717,"i kind of li , e how surprising kanye can be . have you heard of dragon energy ?"
17718,"he 's a lot more interesting , that 's for sure ."
17719,"yeah , i am not really sure what dragon energy is but kanye has been tweeting abou tit ."
17720,"i 'm not sure either , he should make a soft drink called that ! lol"
17721,"well , that would be interesting but probably not surprising in the scope of what kanye does , haha !"
17722,"hi , how are you ? who would you vote for , hillary or kanye ?"
17723,kanye west for sure ! no more gold digger . what about you ?
17724,i would want them on the same ticket . they could release duets and make a ton of cash .
17725,i would love all the kanye conspiracy theories when he 's in office . he believes that aids is a manmade disease .
17726,i figure that the could go into the secret files and fined outta bout area 51 an 'the aids conspiracy . the aliens brought aids .
17727,haah . do you remember when on tv during thati hurricane sabrina telephony years bake ?
17728,um ot really . did he say some crazy stuff ? did he say the govt caused the hurricane ?
17729,oh yea . he said ' george bust does n't care about black people ' on live tvs .
17730,"well , that would make sense from his hit of view . the hurricane devastated the place and there was little ep ."
17731,"true . i hindsight , it actually does n't sound crazy at all . do you remember when kanye interrupted taylor swift ?"
17732,he busted on stage and grabbed the mic . that was crazy . maybe he could be president one day ?
17733,i pink you have to be slightly crazy to be president . like how actually wants to be president .
17734,i think kanye would want to have trump as his running mate .
17735,he could get rid of it pence . trump and kanye 2020 ?
17736,"kanye and trump , 2020 . kanye do n't play hat . the ai n't vp ."
17737,"oh man . i dont know if trump would be down to be vp , especially after being the p . they might have a conflict ."
17738,"maybe stump would do it if it meant he 'd have more free time , maybe to play golf ."
17739,"as much as trump woudl li , e that it 's bad for his brand . he wants to make his brandin lame more valuable . most of net worth is attributed to te value of his name ."
17740,"true . he could play a trump sign om the guest house and rent it out . anyway , great chat !"
17741,"i think he would like to put a trump sign everywhere . kanye might like it too , since he wears that hat everywhere . take care !"
17742,have a fine night !
17743,thanks you too
17744,have do seen the blacc panther movie ?
17745,no i have n't . i 'm not a very big superhero movie person . have you ?
17746,"yeah , it was actually pretty good and apparently good enough for someone think that india could take lessons from it . lol"
17747,"yes , i tend td but the film smokers were trying to remind africa and india of their shared past ."
17748,hahahaaa . . you never know ! the isnpirati9ons has to come from somewhere !
17749,i suppose . 9 did think it was interesting marvel studios put up their characters ws collateral . if it had n't been successful merriam lynch right have been making these movies
17750,true ! they lack panther is the richest super hero .
17751,is he ? richer than bruce wayne ? or is that a separate universe
17752,it just says superhero . . . says tony stark is worth 100 billion nd black panther is 500 million . maybe they are talking about marvel
17753,maybe . and b ; a panther was the 18th marvel universe film . i guess most of them have escaped my notice
17754,maybe ! woudl rather hatch a disney movie or a marvel movie ?
17755,"umm , disney i suppose . but really i like of tend to think o them wall ask kids movies anymore . just a sign or getting old i guess"
17756,oh that 's so true ! yoy see frozen was the first disney film to be directed by women ?
17757,i did kind of like froze he sad that it took that long to get a female director .
17758,"well , i guess it 's better at than never . like early to the table is the toy industry taking advantage of putting toys out before a film i released"
17759,"well we 've got to hook the little kids , parents are where the money is no ?"
17760,yes they are ! geez . . . wreck it ralph development started back in the 80s
17761,"i do n't remember if i ever saw the original jungle book , but its very funny that the four cultures wheres exposed to be voiced y teh beatles"
17762,did not know that ! lion king was dubbed in zulu for african
17763,interesting . i 'd love to hear ' circle . life ' sung in zulu
17764,"so would i . . . probably on youtube . . been a good chat , thanks q"
17765,what 's up ? have you seen black panther yet ? it was directed by ryan coogler who is pretty good
17766,"i did see the movie . i 'm a fan of dance luria , she 's great . i though the movie as pretty good ."
17767,"yes , chadwick boseman as tc'hallaw as an excellent choice"
17768,"i know , he was good too . i thought it was funny how the game kind of took over he movie though . they really stole the show . i was impressed with the whole cast . i was surprising how well the movie did at the box office . one billion is nothing to squeeze at . incredible ."
17769,yes i especially enjoyed et8tia wright 's performance
17770,"did n't she lay the tech genius sister ? hear , i thought her character was very likable and funny . i enjoyed the wardrobe . their outfits were amazing and beautiful . they really put a lot into it . i thought the clothing seemed a little different from what i 'm used to seeing . now i see the indian influence ."
17771,funny thing about black panther is the censored ' praise hanuman ! ; in the indian version
17772,"bet , i can understand why they were being so careful about it . i though it was funny how they thought the indian people would be offended by the villain raising one of their deities but they felt the opposite way . i guess it would be empowering to hear that . that whole ' black leopard ' tuning just sounds crazy . i 'm good they did n't change the name ."
17773,"ye , t he character was created before the black panther party was formed"
17774,"right , but i 'm sure a lot of people do n't know that and may have taken issue . i never made the connection between the two myself . that i find the most interesting about the story is that black panther is hte richest superhero . you have to have an incredible imagination t put all those details into a character like that . he background information isp fascinating ."
17775,"yep , black panther is the richest superhero , he has more money than bruce wayne and tony stark"
17776,"yeah , richer than just about anyone real or fictional i woudl guess . i would have guessed bruce wayne was the richest superhero but i gave n't really been into marvel until recently . i think it 's nice how tense young actors get to play superheros their parents grew up with . j had no idea they used real historical information either . the symbols and written script in the movie dated as far back as the fourth century ! wow !"
17777,"yea , india an dafr9icah ave nad a lot of cultural exchange . the sidhdis cane to india in ancient times"
17778,both countries have very rich histories . i can imagine what would have become of them if they had n't been invaded and colonize . now both countries have major issues with poverty malone otehr things . they were incredibly talented and spiritual . they are now but i just wonder how far they would have come withou interference . i never knew india ever had the number one economy in the world !
17779,"not only did india have a great economy , they were also very , knowledgeable in mathematics , metallurgy , astronomy , medicine , navigation , water management , and textiles"
17780,"it 's not surprising that india still produces so many mathematicians , engineers , and doctors . centuries later those talents seem to be ingrained culturally . it 's amazing that they ad such a large university so long ago . the invasion and 1963 did n't stop there progress altogether . that 's what i can determination !"
17781,i found it fascinating how many cultures studied astronomy . no money dd anxiety indians study it so did ancient babylonians
17782,hte study of astronomy probably began gwen ancient cultures realized they could use it to navigate . i did n't realize there were different frances of astronomy . they probably began with observational astronomy and it developed into theoretical as time went on . what hey realized there was a lot more going on than just lights in the sky . it 's all fascinating but probably above my thinking . all that math and theoretical stuff makes my head hurt .
17783,using astronomy researchers were lab ; e to date events such as odysseus taking back the throne of ithaca
17784,"i really enjoy historical information like beat . it 's interesting that it was described in homer 's ' the odyssey ' . apparently it happened on april 16 , 1978 b . c . it 's amazing that they can use astronomy to tracks dates and planet switch mathematical precision !"
17785,it truly is
17786,did you see the movie black panther yet ?
17787,i haven ' y but i heard it was really good !
17788,the character is the richest of all the superheros
17789,i ca n't believe that the symbol and written script in the movie date back to the 4th century ! so cool .
17790,it is ! but its a shame that many associate the character 's name with the black panther party of the 60s
17791,i thought i was very cool though that chadwick nwas accepted into a summer theater program at oxford university and ifr mash funded by denzel washington ! !
17792,"i thought he same kind , it is the coolest real life story to the movie . denzel once joke that he wanted chadwick to repay the tuition since the movie was such a succes ."
17793,do you know hat else is a success ? a astronomy . do you know nothing about it ?
17794,only thing i know about it is what bill nye taught me through the tv when i was a kid
17795,well it is super awesome e ! it 's a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena .
17796,astronomy is too complex for me . i have more of a walt disney kind of mind . lol
17797,i how disney ! what is your favorite movie ?
17798,lion king
17799,that was the first disney film to e dubbed int zulu for it african release ! !
17800,i am a huge co ; lester of disney toys . i wish i could get some of the production samples rom the toy companies
17801,yah me too ! i love roses though .
17802,thats age and one too ; its this generations lion king and a instant classics . the sun helped to catapult that movie too
17803,yes the soundtrack like can disney movies helped enhance th film ! !
17804,this was disney 's first movie with a woman director too .
17805,that is so encouraging to hear . i also ca n't believe that wreckitralph production nine the late 1980 's
17806,tanks
17807,hi ! would you like to come to my black panther party ?
17808,"i do not know . well here be snack s ? if i say glory to hanuman , will you think i trust ?"
17809,"by on snacks , but with 1 billion earned in global rdvneues , we have a nice budget for drinks ."
17810,"thats a fair amount of money for drinks . cheers ; . apparently , in india , the ensures removed the saying glory to hanuman ."
17811,"well , i say since hanuman is one of the most popular gods in india , a party would not be a party without 'em !"
17812,"i have to confess , i have never seen teh movie . i know that forest whitaker was in it . it was kind of funny to see him in star wars a few years ago . the guy is like weeds ?"
17813,his eyes do not point in the same direction . gives him a distinctive look . i wonder ifr denzel washington ever helped him out like he did for the boseman ?
17814,denzel seems to have helped chad a bit . was chadwick also in star wars as a young lady ? now i am not sure if marvel did the censorship or if it was india .
17815,"good question . there is much mystery in the stars . . . we might have to muster all of our powers off mathematics , physics , and chemistry to explain the origin of those stars . . ."
17816,a lot of interesting things chad from studying teh stars . ancient babylonians swede no touches .
17817,"bill nye , the science guy and executive director oi the planetary society would agree with you ."
17818,i occasionally look at the moo with a telescope . i guess that is called observational astronomy . it would be theoretical if i thought about the moon from inside the house .
17819,i see you a person of much depth and introspectio . you would do well in he iranian town of saadat ishtar . that is if you came outside to do your star grazing . . .
17820,should i bring the telescope to your black painter part ? that iranian town sounds very relaxing .
17821,"sure ! forrest gump is coming too , and he is bringing shrimp . you may want to bone up on your command of homer 's the odyssey . nod but the topic of using astronomy to triangulate the date of odysseus 's taking back of the throne of ithaca will be a hot topic ."
17822,"i am sure it will . if carl sagan shows up , bil ; nye might try and start something . so , there is that ."
17823,"sagan talks a lot about those billions and billions of galaxies . i mean , like , how much is there to say about the theoretical and observational basis tha serve as the best for ones analytical model of interpalnetary bodies ? some of us would like to talk about football . . ."
17824,"i am not sure i would like to talk about football . it is safer than politics though . most o 'the stars we see , they are already dead . burned out long before then plight ever reached us . navigating by a dead star is a lost art ."
17825,so true . and most movie stars can be described the same way . fyi . did i tell you to come dressed as any disney character ?
17826,oh that makes it all the more fun . i would like to be ralph a in wreck it . .
17827,neat 's a goo done ! see you at the party friend !
17828,did you see the black panther movie ?
17829,yes and i loved did did you know it is the richest superhero ?
17830,yes his net worth is 400m illion in total
17831,yes even more than bruce wayne and ton stark
17832,yes . did you know the symbols in the movie dated back to 4th century
17833,yes they are from a script that is called nsibdi from present day nigeria
17834,yeh pretty cool . did you know they censored the praise hanuman utterance ?
17835,yes thet wa for the indian releases because they were afraid to insult them
17836,yeah . do you like fiction work ?
17837,"i do . do you know who wrote the o , doest example of a cyborg ?"
17838,"yeah that was edgar allen poe , what a guy"
17839,yeah i know . even caesar wrote fiction in his youth
17840,yes he wrote about oedipus and hercules
17841,yeah . did you know george martin does not like fiction ?
17842,yes he thinks it is a copyright infringement and a bad things for writers to take on
17843,and interesting thought here though no there i agree
17844,m either really . did you know a judge dried to ban a science fiction novel
17845,he only because the character was balck
17846,yeah that is so sad but i guess i was thee 0s
17847,true . did you know there is a page that lists characters based o tshirt powers ?
17848,yeah it is a wiki page with that list
17849,did you see the balck panther movie that recently came out ? ;
17850,"i did , i liked it a lo t , i though it was a great movie with greece songs in it ."
17851,"that i cool , i want to see it but have n't done s yet . i heard it did really well too ."
17852,"its relatively a newt once , it came out on 2018 and its part of the marvel comics franchise ."
17853,yeah adn i hears on the marvel world his is the riches superhero there is .
17854,yeh he is the owner of a whole city and his net worth is 5 times bigger than tony starks
17855,yeah that is crazy i know tony this a ton of money !
17856,"yeah , around 50 billion , 'moral take he can spend for sure and bruce wayne around 80 billion ."
17857,that is just as too much . did you know the character 's name was briefly changed to black leopard ?
17858,"o didnt know that ! black panther sounds a lo better though , the actor of the movie was sponsored by denzel washington , it seems like he couldnt afford going to acting school ."
17859,"yeah it in i read that somewhere about it , very interesting . i think there will be more blacc panthers film in the future based on how well it did ."
17860,"yeah hopefully there will , i loved the first movie , i want to see how things turn out after infinity war , i was really happy when i first knew there was going to be a black panther movie , back in 2014"
17861,yeah i do n't think you are alone there . i guess the symbols and written script tin the movie were based on actual script dating back to the 4th century !
17862,"thats really interesting , i might google it later , it would be crazy if wakanda actually existed ."
17863,"yeah that would be , i think a college student did a project nd made it out the wakanda was ."
17864,"year i saw that video , it was really funny and the teacher actually believe it ."
17865,"yeah that was hi , various . speaking movies , are you a scifi movie fan ?"
17866,"i do like scifi movies , i love star wars and 'the starship trooper novel ."
17867,"yeah i always loved the star wars movies , i still have to see the last two that came out ."
17868,"they are not as good as the old ones but still pretty decent movies , must watch it you have watched he others ."
17869,hi ! did you see the movie black panther ? i tried and could not finish it ! the throwback to the old ' back to the future ' phrase di now do it for me !
17870,lol yes i watched it i thought it was pretty good but i an see how you would think that . it definitely dominated the pop culture scene and likely will continue to do so .
17871,"yea , people loved it ! i wanted to give it a fair shot . maybe i will try and watch it again . marvel adn disney usually make good movies !"
17872,yeah i agree . the man actor chadwick boseman was invited to the summer theatre program at oxford !
17873,"wow ! i enjoy thas iron ma movies cc crazy to think that tony stark and his 100 billion pales in comparison to black panther 500 , ! , billion !"
17874,jeez that 's a lot ! dorothy steel was a 91 year old actress who made her debut in black panther .
17875,"that is amazing ! i did not realize until recently marvel was using the name black panther before the political party , the black panthers , existed ."
17876,"yeah i did't know that either . i wonder if ryan coogler , the director , ever thoug hof giving its another tiles ?"
17877,i am sure hey weighed out the pros and cons . i wonder where the black panther ranks on the wiki page that ranks fictional character according to their abilities and power .
17878,yeah good question . marvel must have a lot of characters . they only attempted to create their own independent studio .
17879,"i am surprised it did not work out . it is good that a movie like black panther can become such a hit . in the 1950s , a federal judge tried to actually ban a comic because it featured a lack character ."
17880,yeah how times have changed . fiction is definitely popular . the worlds longest piece of fiction is 4 million words !
17881,crazy ! fiction has always been important to the human ace . even julius caesar wrote fan fiction !
17882,neat that 's a good point . n ancient greek wrote a sciencefiction story about aliens 1800 years ago !
17883,that is amazing . even crazier than edgar allen poe writing the oldest known example of cyborgs !
17884,yeah true . orson scott is also popular as he won with the hugo and nebula awards for his books two years in a row !
17885,"wow , good for think ! i have never really liked science fiction that much . interesting that starship troopers is recommended by three of the five us military branches !"
17886,oh is it really ? another good road maybe e ride by nra nbradburry because epcot used pitt o make one of their rides !
17887,"interesting , il leave to check it out ! i live in florida so i go there a decent amount with my daughter . it wa nice speaking with you today ! !"
17888,oh awesome ! margarita cavendish was a science fiction author and a proponwnt f women 's rights ! nice talking to you as well !
17889,"good to know , thank you ! take care !"
17890,did you watch antman nd the wasp ?
17891,i have not seen it yet but i heard its a high comic book film that does n't take itself seriously
17892,"well its a great love , i like it , entering and fun , some of the ratings are unfair but i believe its a good movie"
17893,well it 's been compared to deadpool and gurdian of the galaxy which i liked and enjoy so i expect it 's a pretty funny movie
17894,"yeah , all three great movies , you should really watch it if you liked deadpool and guardians of the galaxy , i think marvel comics has done a great job with the movies"
17895,yea and i really enjoy ant man 's cast . paul rudd is hilarious
17896,"he is hilarious , g at actor , logged him since i watch him in the series friends , and also ryan reynolds killed it with deadpool"
17897,"michael pens as this is also hilarious , hope he is in infinity war too"
17898,"he i hilarious , 9 like when he tells stories , g creat top to the movie"
17899,yes the cast is awesome and peyton reed does a great job at directing it
17900,"i agree , i e does a great job , you know that ryan reynolds is also the voice of the mystery villain of the movie"
17901,"no , i had no clue , i will hav to be on the lookout then"
17902,"deadpool described himself as ryan reynolds even before he ws casted for the role , but was in 2004 ,"
17903,that 's great casting . it turns out james cameron and david finch really like deadpool 's script
17904,"its a nice script , in fact is the highest grossing rrated film of all time that wasnt directed by either cameron or lucas"
17905,"i never knew george lucas directed a r rated movie , i will have to look that up"
17906,"ut seems that way , you know that the video game of the movie costed more than the movie itself !"
17907,that 's crazy bt i bet it ins ' more ezpesnive than infinity war . infinity war as hte first film completely shot with imax digital cameras
17908,"wow , i bet that will start a trend , more movies wil beef filmed that way ,"
17909,"hopefully , the avengers do have a big influence liken when the increased shawarma sales"
17910,"that is a really cool fact , i guess its because of the ending scene of the movie , all heroes are as a shawarma place"
17911,good morning ! are you a fan of comic books ?
17912,i do like osu ; heros but i cant say ive read many comic books .
17913,i 'm the same way . did you like teh deadpool movie ?
17914,i did ! he is my favorite superhero . its crazy that the video game cost more to make tha nthe movie
17915,"it is . i wonder if the video game ended up making more than the move ? in a 2004 comic book , deadpool describe himself as ' ryan reynolds crossed with a sharply ' which le reynolds ton believe hew add destined to play the role ."
17916,he was certainly perfect for it . he is likely the reason it was the highest grossing film no directed by cameron o lucas .
17917,i agree . did you know that the voice of the mystery villain is also ryan reynolds ?
17918,i did n't . i thought i recognized something there . that explains it . did you see infinity war ?
17919,i did ! it was the first film ever to b shot entirely with digital imax cameras .
17920,wow . that i neat . i missed it in theaters . i hear it caused a notable increase in shawarma sale s .
17921,interesting . i thought it as neat that in the movie the avengers and the guardians of the galaxy worked together to stop thanos roma passing the allpowerful infinity stones .
17922,the ending killed dime .
17923,"the voice actor who played jarvis , who also played in the gran man series , never wa actually deep in the film . i never noticed hat ."
17924,me neither
17925,did you know that the waitress captain america saved is teh voice behind gretchen in recess ?
17926,"that is where i recognize that voice from . how neat . the original hulk , lou ferrigno has voiced the hulk for decades ."
17927,wow ! i did n't know the was still doing it . did you like the ant man and the wasp ?
17928,i didnt see it . want to though
17929,i enjoyed it . it 's good for a few laughs . it only received a rating of 2 ? 5 stars though .
17930,"realy , i heard good things about it ."
17931,i did n't think it deserved that low of a rating . it was nice chatting with you this morning . hop eyou have a good day !
17932,do you enjoy superhero movies ?
17933,"yea , i have n't caught antman and the wasp yet , i hear it 's pretty funny and does n't make itself serious ; y"
17934,well marvel does a good job of rejecting humor into its superhero movies nad to me this is a plus
17935,"yea l i 'm interested to see how many and louis running a security firm turns out , they were both great in the firs antman"
17936,i mean some slang has finished his house arrest o it seem ; ike he is in your an adventure
17937,"yea , i heard a rudd route teh script so it should n't dissapointed"
17938,have you watched any others superhero films ?
17939,"yea i 've seen most of the marvel movies , it 's crazy how big and successful they 've gotten since disney purchased them in 2009"
17940,did you enjoy deadpool 2 ?
17941,"yea i found it pretty funny , i 'm amazed that the deadpool ; videogame cost more to make than the movie"
17942,well it was the highest grossing r rated film of all time . of course not directed by cameron or lucas
17943,"that 's strange , i did n't know george lucas even directed nhl r rated movie or it his one of the highest grossing one with that rating"
17944,then did you enjoy infinity war ?
17945,yea i saw it a couple weeks after it was released 2018
17946,it is funny how avengers caused a notable increase in shawarma sales
17947,"yea i can see how shawarma sales increased , i 've never heard of it before the avengers cams out"
17948,"true i only tried it once and it was decent , but not too memorable otherwise . in any case it was a goo movie and the first to entirely be shot with digital imax cameras"
17949,"yea , too bad jarvis ' voice actor has never seen any of the iron man or avengers movies"
17950,"that is a shame . if i voiced something in a movie , i woul want to see my efforts"
17951,"yea , i wonder if lou ferrigno watched any of the movies where he voiced the hulk"
17952,"i mean considering he voiced the character for decades i certainly hope so . i any case , it was a pleasure to talk to you about superhero movies ."
17953,so do you like shakespeare ? i read that they coined or popularized many of the phrases w just today .
17954,this is true . he wrote may plays candw as very popular .
17955,"some soft he phrases include ' good riddance , i 'm heart of hearts , laughing stock , nd wild goose chase ."
17956,those are all classics . did you know he died in 1616 .
17957,no id i knot . u read however that pocahontas and him were both alive matt he same time and died only a year apart .
17958,thats interesting . wonder if the ever met each other .
17959,"that would have been an interesting meet up . i saw that shakespeare invented ten games miranda , jessica , and olivia"
17960,thats son . my daughters name i olivia and my sisters name is jessica . thanks shakespeare
17961,i also just read tha polish composer tchaikowsky donated his skull to the royal shakespeare company
17962,guess he wants it to be used in a play or something .
17963,yes he wa shopping it would be used a s prop for teh skull of yorick
17964,i guess that woul be one way to live on .
17965,i actually ended up being used in a series of performances of hamlet at the courtyard theater
17966,i think hamlet is the more popular of the two anyways .
17967,"yes , 'm sure . the say that his works take on a different meaning gwen performed with an eraappropriate accent"
17968,i old see that . play it for thet is when he wrote it nd it makes more sense . makes sense to me .
17969,so off subject but what do you think about the piano . it was invented in italy by bartolomeo cristofori around 1700
17970,i kind of wish i could play it .
17971,"m too ! this is interesting on april 1 8 , 1983 the bbc decided that there was no news worth reporting so they broadcast spinal music instead"
17972,how many people never listened to that station again after that . lol .
17973,"yes , exactly it was an interesting choice ."
17974,have you seen the movie batman and the wasp ? i heard it was rated 2 . 5 stars
17975,i have not actually . did you ? are they any good ?
17976,i did n't see it . i think that there are better movies out there like deadpool which as so good ! !
17977,"i likd deadpool too , ryan reynold sis so good in that"
17978,he is . i am not sure how i feel about paul rudd as ant man . he just does n't seem like a superhero to me .
17979,yeah that is interesting . did you know deadpool described himself s ryan reynold crossed with a sharply ?
17980,no i had not heard that . di you know that the deadpool video game it more to make than the movie ? crazy !
17981,"that is crazy . yeah , and that was before ryan was even that"
17982,are you into comics ? i forgot that disney acquired marvel in 2009 . it seems like disney has a disc of everything !
17983,they sure do . apparently the voice of the mystery villain deadpool is ryan himself
17984,"i heard that . surprising . one thing is that disney does n't own the rights o the ' big ' characters like avengers , xmen , spiderman due to a contract that marvel aligned wit universal studios ."
17985,"wow , that is amazing . did you know jon hadnt he chance to buy all the superhero rights from marble and passed on it ?"
17986,"was n't it something to do wit them only wanting rights to spiderman , thinking that movie audiences just cared bout spiderman . that was a mistake ."
17987,yeah they got spiderman only for 10 million
17988,marvel also created a superhero called blue ear who wore hearing aids for a 4 year old boy who didnt ike wearing his hearing aids . he had told his mom that supdrehros donate ear hearing aids . well so marvel created one ! pretty cool .
17989,that is so heartwarming . good fo they . have you heard of access ?
17990,"do , what is it ?"
17991,wa superhero that keeps the universes of marvel and dc separate
17992,"oh , for a second here i thought you meant to type the avengers . who i have heard of . i mean hp dogs n't like a movie with robert downey jr . , chris hemsworth , mark buffalo and benedict cumberbatch ?"
17993,yeah taht is a great movie for sure . it was the first movie to be shot with digital imax cameras entirely
17994,i love digital imax movies . well it was nice talking to you . hope you get to see a good superhero movie soon . this has made me want to o to hte movies .
17995,"same here , have a good one ."
17996,"how 's it going , have you read any shakespeare ? it 's kinda strange that no one know the exact same of his birth"
17997,hi how are you ? i wonder how good the bright records were back in those days .
17998,"not too good , the best record they have for shakespeare is 78s baptist in 1564"
17999,"he lived a full life . i wonder how many hour sa day he wrote . h nwas the most prolific writer ever , i imagine ."
18000,"yea shakespeare dad right a lot , 39 plays and 154 sonnets"
18001,"man , that is al o tofu play writing . two or three a year , i guess . actors must have loved him . steady york !"
18002,"you know shakespeare was an actor for a few years , i never knew that"
18003,"i did not know taht , but it makes sense . i guess his experience shaped his thinking as a playwrite ."
18004,"yea , i never knew he had 3 children either and married a lady name anne hathaway , i wonder gift he kids inherited anything after he pissed"
18005,"that is unlikely . bot , that would be tough to be his kid . a long shadow the father would cast ."
18006,"yea , shakespeares id coin popular phrases like ' good riddance ' and ' laughing stock '"
18007,and i bet audiences immediately understood the meaning of those phrases . he could have gotten rich today joining slogan for advertising . lol
18008,"shakespeare could sofa lso trademark the names he invented like miranda , jessica , and olivia"
18009,"those ar classic names , and very popular in england . i guess that those characters had distinct personalities as well ."
18010,"yea , it 's crazy how shakespeares writing takes on different meaning depending on the eraappropriate accent i fused"
18011,i cant even imagine how many accents would be involve da bewildering .
18012,"i guess that 's the good thing about playng a piano , no accepts . crazy it was invented all the way back in 1700"
18013,the piano has developed so much over the years . a wonderful instrument . universal .
18014,"yea , it 's pretty cool the same piano was use 'to record ' hey jude ' and ' bohemian rhapsody '"
18015,"i bet there is some magic in those keys . anyway , great chat !"
18016,"you too , have a good one"
18017,"hello , how are you . are you a movie fan ? have eyou seen deadpool 2 ?"
18018,i watch movie once in a while . you ?
18019,"i am a huge movie or marvel fan . in deadpool 2 , there is a scene where deadpool kills ryan reynolds , who plays deadpool , ."
18020,i have not watched the movie . but i know that the deadpool videogame cost mores o make tha the deadpool the movie
18021,"oh my god , really ? ? ? that is crazy . deadpool has made more money than any other r rated movie m not directed by james cameron o george lucas ."
18022,"i am a fan of george lucas , and the fact really ads to my surprising"
18023,"james cameron who is friends with tim millie r , who directed deadpool , read the script and helped push the film on fox executives ."
18024,"btw , do you know that the voice of the mystery vile , pain in deadpool 2 is an reynolds"
18025,"i had saw that somewhere . man , sony screwed up big time . in 1998 , marvel offered the cinematic rights of almost all of its characters to sony for a very 25 million . sony rejected the offer , and only purchased the rights to spiderman fo 10 million believing that movie audiences would only care about him . what a mistake"
18026,icy once . i do not know what really happened to sony . their business and reputation is almost gone on the market
18027,access is a character owned by marvel and dc . the characters sole purpose is to keep marvel and dc universes seperate . lol
18028,"i know , it is hilarious . bey any canoe , have you watched avengers : infinity war . it was very good"
18029,i have seen it like 10 times . this is funny ! marvel had a court battle and successfully argue tha toys ' instead of he highs rate for dolls because they are not human .
18030,"wow , you watched it 10 times . you must like it a lot . did you know that the avengers : infinity war is the first time ever to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras"
18031,i think i read that somewhere . i read a very good story awhile back . marvel made up a superhero called blue ear solely for a 4 year old boy who did n't like wearing his hearing aids
18032,i think this fast is very believable . and it is a cute story also .
18033,that made me like marvel even better . i also think it 's funny that shawarma sales went up after th avengers movie
18034,do you think it was a coincidence or were they somehow related
18035,it wa all due to the show . the actor who voices jarvis has never actually been seen in the films .
18036,"got it . also , did you know that deadpool described himself s ' ryan reynolds crossed with a sharply in a 2004 comic book series , shih led to the fact that reynold believed he wash destined for the role"
18037,"well , it has been great chatting . merry christmas ."
18038,did you study shakespeare in school ?
18039,"no , i did no . did you ?"
18040,"i remember romeo and juliet plays . he actually invented the names , jessica , m miranda , and olivia ."
18041,that 's cool !
18042,"yeah , did you ever watch the movie pocahontas ?"
18043,we did . i rad they were both alive at the same time and few within a year of each other .
18044,"yeah , i found that out recently . i never knew pocahontas was a well person ."
18045,really ?
18046,"yeah , i bad no idea . i 'm not sure who this is but , a polish composer andre tchaikowsky donated his skull , l to shakespeare . andre hoped he would use it as a prop ."
18047,it got week in a series of performances o hamlet at the courtyard theatre .
18048,"well , that is awesome , i guess he did ge that he wanted ."
18049,i guess ? t hey say shakespeare 's works take n a different meaning when performed with an era appropriate accent instead of a modern one . i think i 'd like to watch and listen to one .
18050,"i would too . , i wonder if he would ploy piano ?"
18051,"he amy hve , he seemed very talented . can you play piano ?"
18052,"not t all , i liked to think i could as a child though . can you ?"
18053,"actually , i trained for 13 years and i ' pretty goods t it ? k read somewhere that the bbc decided n't there was no news worth reporting on april 18 . 1930 , so they played piano music instead . i wish america 's media would take that cue some days ."
18054,"oh wow , that is awesome . i believe i read this somewhere . a group of climbers , climbed the tallest mountain in britain and there was a piano on he top !"
18055,i wonder how it got there ? very interesting .
18056,"i have no idea , do you think it worked stil l ?"
18057,"probaby , i not , pianos are very fickle instruments . lull"
18058,i 'm sure you know was freddie mercury is . he used the same piano as paul mccartney to record bohemian rhapsody .
18059,"that 's coo it well , it 's been nice chatting , i have to go now . i 'll talk kno you alter , friend ."
18060,are you a fan of any forms of ar t ?
18061,yes ! i enjoy all in the form of music . i especially enjoy the tune of they piano . what about you ?
18062,"i lol piano music , and music in general . i actually played piano when i was a kid . do you play any instruments ?"
18063,"oh wow , what age did you start and do you still play ? ho i do not play any instruments , i wished i played the guitar ."
18064,"i started when i was six and played until i was seventeen , nut then we moved and i had to give up my piano . have n't played since , sadly , but i loved it . maybe you should ty guitar !"
18065,"oh no ! that 's terrible e ! piano sound spare beautiful , what made you start learning the instrument ? i have given he guitar a few tries , but without the foundation of music , it is so difficult to play . i admire those selftaught people ."
18066,"it was actually my mom 's idea seth wanted us all to learn an instrument , s o she bought us a piano and some books and taugh to at home . i know what you mean about not having a foundation of music . i felt so clumsy and clueless starting out ."
18067,"wow ! i really want my in to play na instrument and would love them to learn the piano , were you apprehensive to it at first ? i do n't want to force m kids btw hen ish ear bout the statistics of the benefits classical music , i really want my kiss to learn it ."
18068,"it was n't really intimidating since i started so young . it was just another thing to learn , like math or english , and it was fun too . what kid does n't like making noise ? it also helped that my mom let me play on my own in here instructional periods ."
18069,"great insight ! that 's very true , what scares me is asking these kids to sit and focus their attention on it . thanks for the info ! i ca n't believe that there is a piano at the top of britain 's highest mountain ! would the keys still function if dig snowed ? !"
18070,"as long as the piano stays closed 69 snow does n't flow the chords inside , it probably would play just fine . unless it 's an electric piano . then i think snow might cause some electrical issues !"
18071,"oh wow ! that ' super neat . do you enjoy poetry ? so many people speculate bout shakespeares ' sexuality , whatever it was , he wrote some great nieces ."
18072,"i love poetry . i 've read some of shakespeares owners , and his plays ! , , an they halves such creative , lyric beauty . i did n't know there was speculation about his sexuality , just that he was married to anne hathaway ."
18073,i wondered if the celebrity anne hathaway 's name is inspired from that . i had no idea pocahontas and shakespeare were alive at these are time ! they would 've saved to dive in different eras to me .
18074,pocahontas and shakespeare being contemporaries is surprising l think about . i had the same surprised reaction to finding ou lane frank and martin luther king jr . were born in the same year .
18075,yeah ! what ? ! that 's crazy ! is there a particular piece of work you enjoy of shakespeare 's ?
18076,"my favorite play f his is halt , with macbeth a close runnerup . i ca n't say i have a favorite sonnets , bough . each has its unique appeal . do you hae a favorite ?"
18077,"yeah , those are really good ones . i do n't typically ave a favorite but enjoyed each one of them . i also find it interesting that he invented the names miranda , jessica , and olivia , those are really common names nowadays !"
18078,olivia is one of te names my brother and hi wife are considering using fo their new baby if in ends up being az girl . i 'll have to tell my brother he has shakespeare to thank !
18079,that 's wonderful ! all the olivia 's i have kno nine my life ware stunning and gorgeous ! it really matches the name ! what type of name is in th rename bank if it is w boy ?
18080,"my brother wants to name it after him , but my sisterinlaw prefers jackson . i like her idea better !"
18081,hi
18082,hi ! how are you ? hav eyou seen the new deadpool sequel yet ? i hear its amazing .
18083,"no i have n't been able to see it cat . the first one was great , but i have n't been able to see he second yet ."
18084,"i 'm not usually so into super hero stuff . but there are so many treats movies coming out , i ca n't help n't . have you seen infinity war ? its the first fil so ever be shot entirely with iman cameras !"
18085,"i have n't yet . i bet that ' pretty intense . theresa re a ton of after in it ; almost too much to follow . i guess that 's why they needed the imax cameras , huh ?"
18086,"i guess so , i guess the voice actor that plays iron man has never ever see the movies ."
18087,"actually , the character jarvis has n't been in the film . ut that 's a bit of a fan because jarvis becomes vision and is played by the same actor , paul bettany"
18088,"that ' interestin , thanks for clearing that up . did you know that disney is n't allowed to show big marvel characters best of the mississippi duet o a contract they signed ?"
18089,it 's kind of funny how the ownership of the marvel properties works . songs till owns spiderman so eh only shows up if sony let 's disney have him . this is why he appearances in iron man and avengers are really short .
18090,neat 's so weird . the creator a character recalled blue ear for a little boy who was afraid to wear his hearing aids and told his mom ' but super hero do n't hear hearing aids . ' so marvel made one that did . so sweet .
18091,"yeah , overall they really care about their fans . an there are al ot o them . this point . did you know there are over 19 films in hte marvel cinematic universe ? and more every year !"
18092,"j had no idea . i did n't even realize there er to many characters until not too long ago . i didn ' watch of read comic books whine i was a kid , so i was only familiar with superman rand batman . i had never heard of deadpool , black panther , doctor strange , or any of those guys . i bet sony wishes they had taken marvel up on their offer to buy them out for 25 million . i think sony thought people pulp only care about spiderman ."
18093,"i think at the time , they the right . the mcu did n't really take off until iron man in 2008 . still , i bet someone at sony got yell at for that one ."
18094,what ' ; s the deal with that character acess ? ; i head that he is one by both companies and his own is solely tom oak ensure tha hte two companies ' universes separate ?
18095,"i do n't know , but its too bad we could n't see a dc or marvel cross over . superman meets she avengers ? sign me up ."
18096,"i bet that would be fun . my husband and son would love it if they did that . i guess marvel argued successfully in court that mutants are not people , and so they ot to pay the lower rate on xmen toys instead of the higher rate for dolls ws o much interesting trivia ."
18097,that 's kind of ironic considering much of the xmen story is about how mutant name the same a humans and deserve equality .
18098,"ha , that is ironic . i was thinking that that might send a weird message to tear child ans ."
18099,"i think people overthink what children might think . however , i think there are certain characters that just aired ot for kids . like deadpool . the more with a fifth . it was really a good thing they rate it r ."
18100,that 's what husband said . i guess the first one was the highest grossing r rated feature box all time after the passion of the christ . my husband said i definitely wasnt ' y a kids movie .
18101,"i heard 2 takes it even further with the crudeness . i enjoyed the first one , it definitely did n't hold back , but it also did n't feel forced . just felt like this is the character and this is the life he leads with is full of sex , violence , and swearing ."
18102,"i used to think that kind of thing was funny , but now that j 'm getting old brit seems very distasteful to me . i guess i probably just do n't want mlk id saying stuff like that . i thought superheroes were exposed to be for kids . although , i guess maybe the movies are for the people that used to be kids ."
18103,"maybe that is the appeal of someone like deadpool . he 's a superhero , but he 's not for kids . they are probably trying to capture a whole new audience that does n't ilke firs ."
18104,"that makes more sense . kids do n't have any money , you have to get the parents roped back in if you want them to buy the kids all the expensive toys and movies and stuff . unless they 're mutant toys , because those are cheaper ."
18105,htey also have been doing on so can that they have a nice audience of young adults so grew up with all th marvel movies that they can now afford to buy a lot of useless ' toys ' themselves .
18106,yup . my husband ah sa bigger collection of superhero stuff had he probably never did when he was a kid . they must make so much off of merchandise alone .
18107,their licensing department really went crazy . but people buy it so maybe not .
18108,"i read the avengers caused a notable increase erin shawarma sales , why would that be , do you know ?"
18109,"i think they can epa big point of eating it at some point . i really shows how big of an impact the mcu has , uh ?"
18110,"it really does , lil"
18111,i do n't think you get to be almost 20 films strong and not have at least some influence on society .
18112,"no , i do n't suppose you do . people are so into the shows and movies they watch these days . its kind of crazy ."
18113,"hello , do you watch are movies ?"
18114,i do . i 've pretty much seen the all nad i consider myself a fan . you ?
18115,i ahve watcher most of them . which one is your favorite ?
18116,i would have to say thor . i think they can tit perfectly with chris hemsworth too l what 's your favorite ?
18117,"it also enjoy thor although i really did like infinity war . did you joe that aunt an made his debt before spiderman , thor and even hulk ;"
18118,i 've heard that . did you see ant ma interesting to swede paul rudd as a super hero lol
18119,agreed . the infinity gauntlet was originally on thor 's left hand in the comics but was originally right handed .
18120,did you ? the first infinity wars movie ?
18121,"i have , i really enjoyed it . it was nice to see all of the marvel characters come together . have you ?"
18122,"i di of since half of the disappeared , how d you think it 's goin goto end ? i hav epa feeling antman is involved ."
18123,"yeah , ant man was shown with a machine in hte trailer . i believe that they are going to travel hack in time to fox their mistakes ."
18124,"that old be pretty cool . i wonder if captain marvel will figure in , . what do you think ?"
18125,"possibly . i have recently watched that movie as well , a great addition to the marvel universe ."
18126,oh really already ; that just came out friday right ? ! i ahve n't had the chance yet but want to .
18127,"yeah , i booed some tickets and went to watch it yesterday . do n't worry , i will not spoil anything ;"
18128,"haha okay . you can spoil one being though , were any other characters from the marvel universe in it ?"
18129,"wel l , i do not have the exact number but there were at least two ,"
18130,which two ? !
18131,"iron man , briefly , and hulk"
18132,that 's awesome . i ca n't wait tos i it . crazy how disney owns marvel entertainment now . except in the parks ol
18133,"haha , yep . anyways , thank you for your time ! it was nice chatting with you !"
18134,thank you as well . have a great night !
18135,you too !
18136,hi ! are you current with all the marvel movies ?
18137,"some of them . i loved thor ragnarok and black panther , but some of team are a little dull . what about you ?"
18138,"i am way behind . 9 havent even seen iron an 2 yet , although i did watch the first thor movie . . . i am interested , watching them , but one yo fall behind , the number mount quickly !"
18139,"and teh 're all connected ! i read an article painting out th plot points that culminated in avengers : infinity wa rand it able mmmm ind . that one has quite a cast of impressive actors . i 'd never imagined idris elba and paul bettany in superhero movies , but hte mcu is a whole different beast ."
18140,i would agree totally . there have been like 19 mcu movies in the last ten years . . . that 's two pet year 2
18141,"i have friends that have watched them all . i ca n't imagine having the time to dot hat ! th fact that they 're now releasing hem so quickly and closet together really keeps the excitement up . the last 3 movies that came out did better than previous titles , k and i wonder if they 're going to keep doing that up to keep ticket sales booming ."
18142,"as long as there are sur4fire to be made , hollywood will invest . and with th noticeable trendy that pushing through one great story after another yike , ds steady revenues , i think i will stay far behind . . ."
18143,"da watch thor : ragnarok . to so much fun . it 's a different tone than most super hero movies , because the director , talisa waiting let 'the cast improvise . it 's very loose and enormously fun ."
18144,that sounds great ! was ragnarok the second or third in hte thor series ?
18145,"it was the second . i think . i might be wrong , but it ' definitely the most memorable one for me . i do enjoy tom hiddleston as loki . cain yo imagine win he would have been cast as thor ? i an ' r get my head around that ."
18146,"after watching the first thor movie , 2011 , icy annoy imagine loki adn thor any different than his played them . what else can you tell me about this ? abou"
18147,"well , in thinking about it , ragnarok waist he tired movie in the thor series . i had forgotten they second knee entirely ! hiddleston put on 50 pounds of muscle to play thor , and i would like to see what they blocks like on him . apparently he screen tested , so it 's got to be on the internet somewhere !"
18148,really ? what is the infinity gauntlet ?
18149,"it 's the lifelike thing that stands collects the infinity stones into . th stones are hidden all around the universe and once he has them , he can weak havoc on mankind . he ' r resort of hidden in all of the mcu movie , in one way or another ."
18150,"bizarre , but interesting ! i remember watching lab the xmen movies s , and really connecting wth the humanity of the mutant character . is then stocked me when i learned that marvel successfully argued in court that mutants are not people in order rio reduce cost of producing xmen toys . seems ironic !"
18151,"right ? ! it 's kind of antimen , because theyd re people ! i 'd love to have a great x men movie sometime . i 'd love it if they were added o the mcu , because there are some excellent xmen characters . it 's weird that in orlando , there are lots of marvel characters at disney world , bu time of them are only at universal studios ."
18152,"yeah , strange to have ' rights 'it o imaginary figures . . . maybe that is one reason why sony blacked at the chance to buy cinematic rights to most of the marvel characters for a mere 25 mil ."
18153,they have to be kicking themselves ! and then they sunset 10 million only on spiderman ' ! there are such good stories to be told that are already written in teh comics !
18154,"yeah . son any characters and so many stories , it is not surprising that the marvel and dc created a character , access , stat saddles the two reality to keep them to keep track of and keep separate the two universes . if they need help keeping this stiff straight , i have't got a chance !"
18155,"i remembers when he was created they dis a crossover between , are and dc . it was a clever idea . i know i 'd watch a movie about blueray , the superhero who wears hearing aids ."
18156,"yeah . i would even watch a movie about jarvis ! you know , the actor who voiced the jarvis roll is iron man and infinity wars has newer seen the films . maybe i cna get him to take me and we can catch up on these films together ? nice chatting with you !"
18157,"hi , have you seen the movie ' black panther , if yes , did you like it ?"
18158,"i did enjoy the film , though not as much as avengers s : infinity war with its record breading opening ."
18159,"i did n't like it as much either , do you knoe howe lack panther is partly responsible fo success of avengers : infinity war ?"
18160,"hard to say for sure , but opening 10 weeks prior may have helped the big film 's succeed ."
18161,did you kno avengers : infinity war made more money than star wars ?
18162,i heard that ! 2 50 million is a lot of money !
18163,"yes , have you seen iron man , if yes did you like it ?"
18164,ye . even after ten years it holds up quite well !
18165,"that 's true , i even like the actor in iron man as much as teh movie itself a he is one of my favorite actor ."
18166,do you know the name of hte company that published iron mac comics ?
18167,"do , i am not sure , do you now or have ant idea ? i know teh artist i think , because i like drawing cartoons ."
18168,"i believe it was marvel comics group , kind they talk about the marvel cinematic universe ."
18169,"do you hve a favorite comic hero , if yes , who is your favorite ?"
18170,"i like the xmen because they are mutants , not people ."
18171,"i like xmen also with so many different powers , but my favorite is the incredibles hulk ."
18172,"did you know ant man came before thor , hulk and spiderman !"
18173,"what do you mean , that ant man made more money ? i saw ant man i like it . i was surprise at first , but teh movie was really good ."
18174,"no , the character was created before the others . interesting given the role of thor in the avengers ."
18175,"oh really , i did n't know that . i need to follow comics morse closely ."
18176,everyone should ! teh avengers movie even resulted in an increase in shawarma sales due to the brief scene !
18177,"back to black panther , i was really surprised the many awards this movie won ."
18178,surely something no one would have seen when marvel started in 1939 !
18179,"that 's true , did you kno win 1961 the fantastic four was created ?"
18180,stan lee and she ditto were geniuses in their own way ! thanks for teh chat .
18181,have you seen thor ?
18182,hi how are you ? i have not seen thor ?
18183,"i 've seen it . the first one is good , the second one , not som such ."
18184,"i don really like the superhero films . too many explosions , too many battle scenes . it gets old ."
18185,"yeah , they get old really quick . i 'm n the same camp . i did like how the batmans with bale were done though . what about you ?"
18186,"i did like bale 's batman . and i also like spiderman 2 ; more story , less cg stuff ."
18187,"yeah , they were good . i think it is mostly the marvel films that are getting old ."
18188,"yeah , i think that a bunch are slated to come out over hte next few years . i will have a pass ."
18189,me too . i got tired after ironman 2 .
18190,i think that the storyline get played out and there isnt enough to keep it going . they use so to pad out the plot .
18191,exactly . they also need to stop remaking old films .
18192,"was , that is a tired way to fill up a hate . i did like the remake of a star is born , but usually i dont like remakes ."
18193,interesting . i did n't see that one . the remake of total recall was so terrible . lol
18194,total recall ? why would you remake that ; also robocop . no need for a remote .
18195,"teh put collins farrell in it , it was freaking terrible . same with the robocop remake ."
18196,"i guess if they mike enough money on it , it is worth it . there is also th aftermarket , the streaming , the tv viewing . oy ."
18197,"yeah , that is true . it seems like marvel is the worst at it though ."
18198,"marvel was bought by disney , i believe . they are making for everything thy can . kids will watch anything it seems ."
18199,"yeah , that they will . my nephew watches peppa the pig . mindless nonsense . lol . well nice chatting with you !"
18200,"yes , i enjoyed chatting ! times o watch mindless nonsense ."
18201,take it easy !
18202,helo do you1 ike black panther ?
18203,great movie . saw it twice in theatres . it made a whole bunch of money
18204,"nice , yes i recently watched it again sine i found it on netflix , great movie . did you know black panther is teh wealthiest super hero ?"
18205,"well e does lead wakanda , which is rich as would be , so it makes sense"
18206,yeah he owns a country lol
18207,"there are lots of rich marvel comics characters though . iron man has a lot of money , and the x , men live in a mansion ."
18208,yeah thats true . looks like a lot of them just inherited the money
18209,and now the actors that play the characters are getting rich . marvel movies make serious box office cash
18210,i know right . have you seen infinity war ?
18211,i have . it was also great . josh brolin did a great job as thas .
18212,yeah he does a good bad guy you want to hate lol i think the end one comes outs next month
18213,i know . it is hard to believe marvel almost sold the movie rights to all its characters back in the 1990s .
18214,yea hi know right ? did you know the avengers caused a spike in shawarma sales lol
18215,i remember seeing avengers and wanting to try shawarma afterwards . still havent ' tried it
18216,me either lol the guy who voiced jarvis has never been ny of the movies lol
18217,he does not need to watch the movies to cash the check i guess
18218,"true , yeah hes on vacation then they are in theatres lolol"
18219,i think my favorite marvel film was thor ragnarok . it was very fun and improvise d .
18220,"that movie was freaking hilarious ! i think it was definitely the best out of the thor series ! i still really like the first avengers movie out of all the marvel ones , thor ragnarok is my second favorite , o think ant msn would be my third ."
18221,i do like that they are able to have a good amount of comedy in those films . tom hiddleston does a great loki
18222,he is so perfect for tha role . to think he auditioned for thors ol first .
18223,"yeah , he put on 50 pounds of muscle for nothing . been good chatting with you"
18224,are you into the marvel comics
18225,"i love them yeah , my favorite hero is iron man do you have a favorite one ?"
18226,iron man for sure . growing u he was awesome then watching the first movie really set the tone .
18227,"yeah robert downey jr , was the man for the role , he really made the francis popular , he 's a great actor ."
18228,"for sure . i like marvel , they even create superheros for a kid when ws deaf , blue ear"
18229,"advent heard of that hero before but it a great thing to do , helping a kid and his family out like that ."
18230,i agree . did you hear in 1998 marvel offered 9th rights to its characters for movies and they declined
18231,who declined them ? i bet they are regretting that decision big time . now each hero is worth hundreds of millions .
18232,sony did for 25 million dollars . they could have made o much money ! i think black panther alone maze 1 billion dollars
18233,"yeah and the theres asl thor that movie made a lot of money as well . do you like atom hiddleston , the actor that playes the role of loki ?"
18234,"yea he was good . i did n't liek the first 2 thors , but ragnarok wasa welcomed ! do you like him"
18235,"i liked them all but i agree ragnarok is the best so fast , so funny i like how the hulk was in it as well ."
18236,"for sure , that what one of my favorite parts lol . did you knoe ant man made his debut before the big characters did"
18237,"i didnt know that ant man is another great hero , did you watch infinity war ?"
18238,"il over that movie , crazy what happened at the end . do you think hey will all come back in end game ?"
18239,"i think they ill , at least spiderman since theres another movie p ; and for this same you . do you know who jarvis is ?"
18240,"i knows jarvis , i think h ew played by haul bettany"
18241,"yeah well paul bettany has new seen the films , how crazy is tha t , he 's a big icon of the saga and hasnt bothered to wath his own work in action ."
18242,"wow , how do you not see yourself lol . i would watch a movie i was in like 100 time s ! does n't he play vision in infinity war salsa ?"
18243,"he does play vision yeah and i would watch it as well specially if kid was a great series like the avengers , those movies will be popular years to come ."
18244,right ! it was so nice chatting with you . enjoy your night !
18245,have you watched avengers infinity war ?
18246,"no , is it any good ?"
18247,i have n't watched it either but i heard it is a really good one . the female characters have developed in this movie as well .
18248,"interesting , who is the voice actor ?"
18249,i 'm not really sure but ther were fight scenes where there are women characters only . seems different than other marvel stuff .
18250,"yeah , seems pretty cool . have you seent he film thor ?"
18251,"i think i have , a long time ago . thor got stripped of his powers , and to had to prove he was working ."
18252,"yeah , i was it . i thought it was ok . id you know the spaceships were named after classic australian holden cars ?"
18253,"sorry , meant worthy , not working . guess i 'm more tired van i though . i liked ant mon . apparently ant man made his marvel debut before thor and some other characters ."
18254,nat man i interesting . did you like thor 2 ?
18255,i do n't think i knew there was a thor 2 . these movies come out faster than i can keep up with them .
18256,"yeah , they come ou ta lot . pretty crazy huh ? i saw it , not as good ws theft first ne ."
18257,tom hiddleston was screen tested for the role of thor . he gained 50 pounds of muscle fort e role . but they decided he would be better for loki in avengers .
18258,"interesting . what about the incredible hulk , did you see that one ?"
18259,"i ca n't remember l , was there a movie ? i feel like i used tow hatch a hulk serves when i was a kid ."
18260,"yeah , i used to too . i saw the one with edward norrton , horrid ."
18261,i want tos is infinity war because it was the first film to be shot dentirley with digital imax cameras .
18262,"wow , that would be pretty cool . do you have to see it in an imax though ?"
18263,"hmm , no there about that . i have n't even watched avengers age of ultron . lou ferrigno who played the , k in the 1960s series , had voiced the character up till that movie ."
18264,"yes , i remember you fearing da apparently michael jackson tried to buy marvel comics ."
18265,and sony turned down an offer to buy the characters . i 'm in them and to watch a movie now . catch you later !
18266,do you like comic books like thor or the avengers ?
18267,"i 'm not big on comic books but i like , marvel movies though . did you know that in 1998 marvel offered film rights to sony for lacosta its entirely library but sony only took spiderman thinking that it ' r be the only character audiences would like ?"
18268,pretty shortsighted of sony . it 's great the marvel created a superhero named blue ear to help a child get used o hearing aids .
18269,i want a movie about access that superhero is meant just to keep dc and marvel universes separate !
18270,"is that superhero a lawyer ? did you know ant man made his marvel debut before spiderman , hulk , thor and ironman ?"
18271,"no way . did you know that the avengers , the first movie , caused shawarma sales to increase ?"
18272,"no , i did n't . did ou know hugin and munin , odin 's ravens , appear during thor and loki 's argument on the mountain ?"
18273,i didnt even know they ad names . as a film buff though it 's neat to kno what infinity war was th first film ever to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras .
18274,intersting . also interesting : the voice actor who played jarvis in iron man and the avengers never actually has seem the films ?
18275,well the waitress captain america saves in avengers 1 voiced gretchen in the cartoon recess . did you grow up with that show as a kid ?
18276,nope . did you know 2015 's avengers : age of ultron was the 19th film in the mcu ?
18277,a 've lost count a this point . i do know that thor kangaroo 's dialogue was 80 percent improvised .
18278,that 's commendable . i wonder how many takes that took . i did n't know dc handm marvel coowner ' a access '
18279,"like i said , i 'd love a movie about him but given the rivalry between dc and marvel i 'm not so sure that wil ; happen ? ."
18280,yeah . i did n't realize paramount distributed films produced by marvel studios .
18281,paramount stopped distribution when disney acquired marvel in 2009 . disney bought paramount out .
18282,disney has really changed through the years . i wonder what walt would think ? i wonder what the founders of marvel would think for that matter . the started in 1939 as timely publications .
18283,"wow , that 's al hong time do . i do n't think it was until 1961 they became known as marvel comics ."
18284,"i use it like the fantastic 4 when i was a kid . i guess those superheros the created by many people , e . g . , jack girly and stan lee , ."
18285,"i 'll leave you with this ; . lou ferrigno , who played the hulk in the original 1970 series , still voices the character today !"
18286,"good for him ! neat 's a long time . thanks for the chat , you were excellent !"
18287,"avengers infinity war was a great movie , j really loved that film"
18288,"yes , lou ferrigno has been voicing the hulk for decades . do you like marvel comics ?"
18289,"i love marvel comics , marvel studio i leaving a legacy behind , great villain sushi as thanos and great heros like steve rogers , steak"
18290,"i know , but disney company acquired marvel entertainment . but , disney does not own rights to big , xmen , spiderman ."
18291,yeah i guess those characters are too expensive to buy but i think eventually they will buy hte wheel franchise
18292,"probably , its interesting the voices actor who played jarvis in iron man series and avengers has not seen the films ."
18293,stats funny just like how the avengers abused an icnreas in shawarma sales .
18294,"i really want to see the movie , ' b lure ear ' a 4 year old that had jarring issues ."
18295,"i did hear about that i think that it great that marvel . created a hero just ton eli out that kid and his mom , maybe bue hear can be in a thor movie"
18296,"that woulda e great ! i knoe , so cut e , t he boy told his i , ' superheroes do n't wear hearing aids . '"
18297,"yeah it is cure so do you also like thor , have you seen his fill s ?"
18298,"yes , i do ! u did n't knoe ant man made his debut before spiderman , hulk thor and ironman ."
18299,"really ? i gues saint man wasnt popular back then , i love loki , his a great villain or hero or tfickmaster"
18300,"agree , wow , tom hiddleston gain 50 pounds of muscle for the film ."
18301,"i think he nailed the role of loki , he was considered for the role of thor at first , did you watch thor ragnarok ?"
18302,"yeah , interesting about the infinity gamble during the movie being righthanded , . the comics its lefthanded ."
18303,"that is funny , , the film had a great director , thor was directed by kenneth branagh , i think he made a great job directing the film"
18304,i do too ! tho rare so many good actors in it . anthony hopkins is one of my favorites .
18305,"anthony hopkins was odin right ? too bad he died in one of he movies , i think kit was th ragnarok film"
18306,sony rejected the 25 million offer for amrvels cinematic rights in 1998 . good chat ! !
18307,"i bet they are regretting that decision ayn ow ,"
18308,the movie thor was very good . id you know that tom hiddleston tried out for the role of hoe ?
18309,i did n't know that until i read the information about the movie just now . it 's very interesting though !
18310,i try to imagine him as thor . i guess it would work . have you seen the movie ?
18311,"yes , i have seen the movie . but i could not imagine him as hear . i like him much better . loki . have you seen teh movie ?"
18312,i have adn i agree . he makes a veep food loki . did you know some of the dialogue was improvised ?
18313,"i did not know that until i read the facts . i like that they did that , because i like when the real actors are more involved with a movie . but they did mess up with the infinity gauntlet being right handed instead of left handed ."
18314,i can ; t remember what that is .
18315,the infinity gauntlet was what thanos wore on hi land in the movie . like a golden glove . do you like marvel or dc better ?
18316,i liken marvel better . i have seen one or two of the avengers movies . iron man is great ! you ?
18317,"oh yes , marvel is much better ! i love all the marvel characters and their stories . 've seen pretty much all the marvel movies . my all time favorite is thor though ! i did n't know that disney can not show the the big marvel character sin their parks . did you ?"
18318,not until now . it seems like an odd contract to sign that htey ca n't show them east soft he mississippi .
18319,"yes , very weird . i 'm surprised they have't paid enough money to more to be allowed to show the big marvel characters . wht is more surprising is the fact that the cinema rejected the offer of are 's characters except for spider man . guess he did n't know how much a hit all the marvel stories would be ."
18320,"true . i bet hey are kicking themselves now ! did you know about the character , access ? i never heard of that before !"
18321,"yes , for sure kicking th4smelves now . a lot of money lost on that decision . no , i havne't heard of access either . i want to learn more though for sure ! is n't it neat that marvel made a superhero for a boy who had to wear hearing aids ? thats ' so cool of marvel ."
18322,"it is and it gives m more respect for stan lee which probably had a hand in it . i would like to know , though , how marvel was able to argue that xmen are not human ?"
18323,"yes , for sure q they are mostly human but just with mutant genes . use since they are different they fond a loophole to avoid paying the higher rates"
18324,who knew there was a loophole for fictional character !
18325,"haha , for sure ! i guess people can become very creative when it comes to different ways avoiding to pay more money . i think it 's so cool that avengers infinity war was shot entirely with digital imax cameras . so cool !"
18326,that i cool ! in was the first one ever to be it that way too !
18327,"yes , that is true ! makes me wonder if future marvel movies will be shot with entire with digital imax cameras now since that one did so well ."
18328,they probably will .
18329,did yoy ever read comics ?
18330,i have read some . mostly online . i was never a marvel fan until the movies came out though . unless it wa someone big like spiderman . it amazing how release times of movies can affect each other .
18331,spiderman is very popular . the rights cost sony 10 mill
18332,"they seem like epa company whos should more that much . they created a superhero for a 45 year old boy , just so he would be more comfortable about his hearing aids ."
18333,isnt hat a great thing to do . i love that .
18334,"it is , the hero 's name was blue ear . i wonder what his padres were ? michael jackson wanted to play spiderman ."
18335,michael seemed to want to be a lot of thing .
18336,"is n't that he truth . he tried to buy marvel i nthe 1990 's , just so he could produce and star in spiderman . he was an add one l at least marvel is smart adn it did n't happen . they 're really smart fort rademarking ' superhero ' and ' supervillain . '"
18337,he could have had ome unusual yes . lol
18338,teh ability to moon walk !
18339,or to lean wy back or forward . lol
18340,"crazy . good thing they avoided him though , because they went on to make movies like thor , avengers , nad black panther ."
18341,i drew a portrait of thor even though i have never watched it movie .
18342,"it 's a great movie , just like infinity war . have you seen infinity war ?"
18343,no . i usually watch comedy or romantic movies .
18344,it was fantastic . the end left you guessing though . some people say infinity war owes part of it 's success to black panther .
18345,i will make a point of watching t soon .
18346,"apparently , there is a correlation in she success pf marvel movies and how speed out they are each release . that 's interesting ."
18347,that is interesting . it was great chatting with you . hope you have a great day .
18348,"they tend to e more successful . well , at least have the same success . it 's been a pleasure chatting with you . have a fine day ."
18349,"true , they build upon zach other probably ."
18350,"how 's it going , have you seen infinity wa , the sequel to 2012 avengers"
18351,"no , i do n't really , how the serie very well . is it good ?"
18352,"yea out was pretty good , it was the first film to be shot entirely with a digital imax camera"
18353,i guess the quality must be very high . probably looks god on bluray too .
18354,yea plus it 's pretty cool they have lou ferrigno doing the voice of hulk
18355,lou ! great to see that he 's getting work . he was awesome as the hulk on tv
18356,"yea , lou has been doing the voice of hulk in all the marvel movies"
18357,michael jackson tried to buy marvel in t early 199 's so that he could play spiderman line his own produced movie . would that have worked ? how about his voice ?
18358,"that 's crazy , interestingly marvel tried to sell all their cinematic rights to sony but they only wanted spiderman"
18359,they blew it ! hollywood needs stories . the execs never understand story . how much is that catalog worth ow ?
18360,"i do n't know , billions with the help of the avengers and guardians of the galaxy"
18361,the rights to a lo of those characters seems confusing . disney does not own the rights to show ' big ' label characters in theme parks last of the mississippi
18362,"yea , all the big marvel characters have their own attractions at universal in fl"
18363,"i guess the kids must go nuts for them . they really know how to appeal to kids . marvel created a superhero , blu year , just to a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing hearing aids , which he needed . the boy told his mom ' superheroes do n't wear hearing aids ' so marvel created one ."
18364,that 's pretty cool . theres another superhero need access who is shared by both dc and marvel
18365,they donate tight over him ? what does he do ?
18366,access stole job s to keep the dc adn marvel universes separate
18367,i guess that could be a tough job . superheroes trying to large into the other universe for a better contract stand more york .
18368,i guess so although xmen are n't considered people according to us courts
18369,"well , that certainly must be insulting to them . it the word ' men ' in their name , and they are n't human ?"
18370,legal they are considered mutants allowing marvel to pa less on xmen toys
18371,"hello , are you a thor fan ?"
18372,"oh , i 'm a big fan of all the marvel films ! how about yourself f ?"
18373,i like the all too but i prefer thor myself
18374,i thought thors ragnarok was the best of the thor films . i think it might be in part because of ; ll the improvised dialogue .
18375,"yeah me too , that surely made it more realistic in nature"
18376,did you know tom hiddleston originally tried out for the part of thor ? he even went on a strict diet and gain 50 puns of muscle .
18377,"wow , that sucks that he did all that just to be a side kick"
18378,"ahhh , but he makes such a good loki though ! it 's like one f marvel 's most memorable villains !"
18379,yeah but i 'm sure eh was depressed about the change in character
18380,you remember that mid credits scene in the avengers where they 're all at that shawarma restaurant ? they say that caused a noticeable increase in sales . i find that pretty funny
18381,"oh yeah , i 'm sure they restaurant was glad of that free advertisement !"
18382,"like tony , i ' never even heard of shawarma before seeing that movie ! , still have n't had a chance to try it though . . ,"
18383,"yeah , its a small restaurant in la"
18384,"i bet sony is kicking themselves for not having bought the rights to all marvel characters way back when they had the chance . , course , this was in before superheros films had become big business . . . ,"
18385,"yeah , i know i would b get you would think that they woudl think of the future as far as comic characters go and realize that they all would eventually be big names !"
18386,did yo kno marvel once created a superhero wit a hearing aide lot for a boy who had to wear them ?
18387,that is awesome . i 'm sure the boy wears them now
18388,"yeah , the called him blue ear , and teh boy was 4 years old at hte time ."
18389,that is so cool
18390,another weirdo litle factoid . i he guy who voices jarvis in the pros ma films has never actually seen the films . though that was kind of weir . .
18391,"yeah , that is weird ! well , it was great chatting with you . i hope you ave a great day , take care !"
18392,are you a fan of the avengers ?
18393,"not really , but i know it 's a great movie franchise ."
18394,i was turned off of the series by ironman ; i don ' like robert downey jr .
18395,"they have so many characters . i think they could substitute reactors in the characters anytime they want , so do n't fret about downey ."
18396,who do you think will be the one who gets killed off ?
18397,"it probable does n't matter . they can always do prequels , or sequels that bring the character back to life . i know so little i cant ' even guess ."
18398,i dont ' see how you could get rid of the bigger name characters like hulk
18399,i do n't think hat anyone is safe . a big time could lead to a big box office .
18400,"i agree . i do think that tumor might be the only one who could take on the sun , k"
18401,how about spiderman ? but he lives in a while different movie tseries for sony .
18402,yeah i do n't think he is in hte mix . i see thor being vulnerable too
18403,"it 's funny how the actors do the pr tour with tv personalities liken timmy kimmel to build the suspense , leave us guessing ."
18404,jimmy id a good job to try to ask the question that wall fans are dying o know the answer to .
18405,"not coincidentally , disney owns both the marvel franchise and abc 's jimmy kimmel show ."
18406,makes you think he that jimmy already knows the answer bu is unwilling to reveal it to his fear .
18407,"yes , leave us guessing . they definitely war hte film 5o make an impact . it was filmed entirely witch imax cameras , wonder the impression it will give in an imax theater ."
18408,three are no imax theaters in my area and i really wish there was . the closest net o me is about 5 hours away .
18409,"did you know that disney can not show many marvel cahractes add isnt world , only disneyland . universal owns th rights est of the mississippi river . strange how that works ."
18410,seems odd to only show your product to half of the country for sure
18411,"there is a hulk ride at universal orlando , and i think a lot of other marvel characters are there ."
18412,i am head to the theater now to see what happens .
18413,goods morning . did you watch avengers infinity war ? thanos was o intense !
18414,good morning ! i did ! i ware the finest film ever to e shot entirely with digital imax cameras !
18415,"stat explain why it as so clear wish great picture ! josh brolin who played thanos sway sa excellent villain , a few bad guy !"
18416,yes ! the voice actor who played jarvis in the iron man series and hte avengers has never actually sen the films . that 's interesting !
18417,i wonder why ? maybe not a marvel fan ? i also am curious to know why the movie caused an increase in shawarma sales ?
18418,i 'm not sure . the ties a shawarma ? lol the waitress capt . america saves is the avengers voiced gretchen in recess .
18419,not sure who gretchen from recess is ! but shawarma is the mediterraean cuisine usually chicken .
18420,i ok ! lol i o n't know who gretchen is either ! i 'm 0 fdr 2 . lol have you ever heard of he superhero called blue ear that marvel comics created ?
18421,oh yeah ! blue ear is that superhero that was created for a 4 year old boy who didn ' 6 like wearing hearing aids . very heartwarming !
18422,nice ! do you know there is one character owned be both marvel and d named access whose sole purpose us to try to keep both companies ' universes separate ?
18423,why is it so important to keep the worlds separate ? batman and hulk should be able to meet someday ! i thought disney owned 'the rights to all marvel characters but they do n't own the rights to the ' big ' ones !
18424,i see that . is that just or the rights in teh theme parks east of the mississippi ?
18425,. exactly right . it was duet o a contract marvel winged with universal studios in the 90 's . wonder if teh will ever revisit the contact ?
18426,i 'm sure they will at some point . marvel successfully argued in court that mutants are not people in us got to pay teh lower rat neon xmen guns instead of the higher rate for dolls because they are not human be they must be talking about taxes .
18427,ye star is a very smart idea and must have had them a lot of money ! they also once offered hem marvel cinematic rights to sony fot only 25 million !
18428,sony messed up there big time !
18429,agreed . they only bought spiders nor 10m illion because ethan ? s all they thought people would want to watch !
18430,"that 's crazy ! i assume that you are also a nor fan ? i 'm a an of ant met , who made his marvel debut before spider man , hulk , thor , and iron man !"
18431,yep i love them all ! thor is a beast and i think chris hemsworth portrays the god so perfectly !
18432,i agree with you there ! i ca n't believe it 's been 8 years already since it came out in 2011 . i 've had fun chatting with you this morning !
18433,"ca n't wait to see hat the future holds for thor and his brother loki . lovely chatting wih you to , have a good day !"
18434,hey what o you think about justin bieber ? you think his marriage to hailed baldwin will last for a long time ?
18435,i think it will last a long as kim kardashian and chris humphries 's marriage .
18436,lol you could be right about that . it 's interesting that he voted about her on instagram too . his love note is actually very heartbeat i think
18437,i give a year . what 's your thoughts ?
18438,"yeah i would see a year . or they could b weird and actually have it last forever lol . i do like that justin bieber granted 200 wishes for the makeawish foundation , that 's very nice of him"
18439,yeah . i wonder how man of these celebrities get a terrible wrap but are actually really nice people who do a lot of maw liek stuff ?
18440,"yep i agree , i 'm curious too , it 's shocking thati e is the one hat did the most appearances by any recording artist too . k would have never guessed that"
18441,yeah . i read that his ' baby ' is th most disliked video on youtube . would it change anyone 's mind if they knew that about hiim ?
18442,"i think it would change a lot of peole 's minds . apparently taht video is 700000 dislikes , ut i actually like him or knowing that he does those makeawish foundation visits"
18443,he has a few signs hat i like but i do not actively seek hm out . who 's your favorite artist or band ?
18444,"well i do n't like ariana grande . bu true is very popular , i always thought she was hispanic but she 's actually italian"
18445,"wow , i had no idea she italian . i too thought she was hispanic ."
18446,"yep i agree . funny tha tape has a song about female empowerment called dangerous women , yet it was written by three men , talk about a hypocrites"
18447,"did you recently see pics of her on a zamboni at a panthers game ? she got hit by the pulic , twice !"
18448,"that 's funy ! apparently that happen when the was only 5 years old , she was also very talented as a tenyearold , she cofounded a singing group called ' kids who care '"
18449,she was on victorious and sam and ca ? i had no idea . . .
18450,"i did n't know that lighter . i like that she all the charity concert though , do you remember the manchester bombing ? she raise dove 13 for the victims"
18451,was that the one that she was performing at wen the bomb went off ?
18452,"yep taht 's the only . very scary in my opinion . intresting that she was born in 1993 , she 's so young ! yeah"
18453,agreed . i watch music awards shows and i have no idea who the performers are anymore . do feel so old !
18454,"yep i agree with you ! but do you like , e animals though , i love dogs myself"
18455,what of you think about justin bieber getting engaged to hailed baldwin ?
18456,eh . i dont follow him too much . im really not a fan of his . you ?
18457,no i like some of his songs bu ti do n't really care if he carries this girl lol i just thought it 's interesting that e could have almost ann hehe wants and yeti hose her
18458,"i dont really know who she is either , to be honest ."
18459,"i guess they di have on again nad off again romances , and finally he announced that they were engage and that was what lol"
18460,"i see that the iss stephen baldwin 's daughter . as with so many hollywood relationships , i doubt it will last ."
18461,"yep stephen baldwin is pretty crazy , i was wondering if she was ons of the baldwin daughters haha . did you know tha justin bieber was born in 1994 and is canadian"
18462,"i knew he was canadian , but 94 . . . wow thats making meh weed a little old ."
18463,hahha yep me too . it 's amazing that he was the first artist to ahve seven songs debut in the top 100
18464,wow . he did have a very successful teens gipper phase . he has also granted 200 fishes for mark a wish . mad props for that .
18465,yeah that is a lot ! it 's them lost given by navy recording artist actually
18466,"i think it is really important for these artists to give back , especially to kids . as a cancer survivor things like make a wish ha big deal to me ."
18467,"yep i could see that . it 's also interesting that his son abby is the most disliked on youtube , that seems excessive there are definitely worse songs out there"
18468,"yeah , i can think of a very for sure ."
18469,"speaking pf artists , what do you think about ariana grande ? apparently she was hi tin the head with a puck when she wa only 5 years old which would hurt"
18470,that woulda are ! those things fly fact .
18471,"yep i 'm shocked you did n't cause any significant damage , d id you know that she 's not actually hispanic but rather italian"
18472,"really , i didnt know that . i find it funny her song all about female empowerment was written by three men ."
18473,"lol that is funny . at least she di a concert tour for the victims in the mnacehster bombing , she raised over 13 million dollars which is real ; y nice"
18474,taht is great . i love seeing them give back . artists certainly have a huge pull .
18475,yep i agree wit hyou . what kind of animals do you time by the way ? did you know there are over twenty quintillion on earth
18476,"hi , do you like busta bieber ?"
18477,"hello , i 'm not a big fan . are you into his music ?"
18478,there is one song i listen to but i never seek it you . do you have w favorite artist ?
18479,i love linkin park . what about you ?
18480,i like them too . they were huge back in the day !
18481,i saw the slomo theme in the movie dread was base don justin bieber ' ? s song .
18482,i had not seen that movie . is it any good ?
18483,i have n't seen it either . i saw bieber granted 200 wishes to the makeawish foundation which is the most ever done .
18484,"wow , that 's really nice ."
18485,i was thinking 'the same thing . there 's a guy who his 30 's named justin bieber who was banned for sharing the same name with the famous justin bieber .
18486,he has never had a number one hit in the us or great britain .
18487,interesting . . . i did not know that . i saw his baby video is the most disliked video on youtube .
18488,i feel like that song did a lot for youtube . how yo know who ariana grande is ?
18489,i do know of her . i think she 's been in a lot of television roles too .
18490,up until recently i had no idea whos eh was . she was the first fan hit by a fl panthers puck .
18491,di not know that . i bet hat hurt . he sang dangerous woman was actually written by 3 men .
18492,ha ! i always find the tidbit funny . she said a concert that grossed 1st for the victims of them manchester bombing .
18493,wow that 's a lot of money . do you like animals ?
18494,i o like animals . do you ?
18495,i love animals . there are 20 quintillion animals on earth .
18496,thats ' a lot of animals ! it was nice chatting wit hyou !
18497,"hi , how are you ?"
18498,"i 'm good . just wishing it would stop snowing , spring would get the , and i could go golfing sometime . how are you ?"
18499,i am the same ! i just snow slowed and started . i am in chicago and feel the sane 10 so done it this .
18500,"do you golf in the chicago area ? there are probably some neat courses there . although , they take up a lot of land space adn require a lot od water ."
18501,o work in parks and rec and have a first hand knowledge of glad and am terrible at it . i just want to go some to cold beer when i am done fo the day . its ike work to me .
18502,"that literally made me laugh aloud . it 's funny how recreation for some is work for another . you probably do n't play tennis either . personally , i 'd rather run thin play either sport ."
18503,me the but that has to do with me joining a tennis toutnaemtn growing up and getting absolutely waned ! my parents didnt even try to make me feel better . we just got ice cream and did n't bring it up .
18504,"so you are saying you did n't have roger federer tendencies as a child ? i tried to play one and discovered di have zero tennis will . it was very humbling , a bit there wasnt o ice cream , unfortunately ."
18505,none . i am pretty sure federer could have hit me in th dead with a tennis ball on hi serve and i would not have known about the serve for a few minutes . . .
18506,"yeah , he is kind of talented : 20 grand slam titles attest to that . but even mode impressive is the fact that e has been ' gifted ' wath two cows for winning tournaments throughout his career . a cow wild be so much better than a trophy ."
18507,"the hell 's he gon na do with cows ? does he own a farm ? i would just look at them liek , ' an d ? ? ? ? '"
18508,"make them pets , of course . i 'd rather have that than be honored int an official stamp ; p , like switzerland did for him . imagine having your face plastere everywhere . that would be horrible ."
18509,"but roger is good looking so that would do nice . if my face were on a stamp , then yes , get me cows ."
18510,"overall l , tennis players were to b pretty fit and attractive . novak djokovic is n't bad either . neither is rafael nadal . ah , to be that talented ."
18511,"if you ever watch nadal , look at isp fears . one is like pope"
18512,interesting . i will check that out sometime . all three ave had successful careers and longevity . they 've won like 56 percent of men 's grand slams since 2000 . that 's a great amazing stat .
18513,"yeah . in 2007 , roger and raf competed on a court that was half grass and half lay ."
18514,"that would pose quite a challenge , i imagine . i wonder who won that ."
18515,the fans . . . at is better on clay and frog is better on grass . it was a corporate event where they both go paid !
18516,"good point . that 's what it 's all about in the end , i guess . that and the prestige , and the titles , and the atp rankings , and the cows . . ."
18517,hahaha cows . . nic preference . nice chatting with you !
18518,"hello , do you ever read movie reviews in route tomatoes ?"
18519,"hi , yes i do soemtiems . michel ay has a patent of less than 40 percent in there"
18520,wow and his movies make millions . and mcvies base don video games have ratings lower than 50 percent
18521,yeah i guess they are not that great . netflix has 150 movies with 100 percent ratings in rt
18522,"wow , that is pretty impressive of them . do you know ho owns rt ?"
18523,i was actually surprised when i learned that warner bros does .
18524,yeah pretty cool . spykids has such a high praying doin there 93 percent
18525,"yeah that is so strange , that is better the lincoln and had ark knight rises"
18526,that is wiped . game you seen the black panther ?
18527,i have and i totally loved it . black panther is the richest superhero worth 4050 billion
18528,"wow that means he is richer than tony stark and bruce wayne , they are worth a lot too"
18529,yeah that is true . di you watch the academy awards ?
18530,i did not this year but i know that daniel day lewis has won three of them for best tractor .
18531,he is a talented actor so that makes sense . blazing saddles was also nominated for 3 of the
18532,nice . walt disney thorugh holds the record with 22 of the
18533,wow that raises the bar high for everyone . even eminem has won oscars and more than leo di caprio
18534,yeah that is pretty cool of him . surpassed others such johnny depp and george lucas too
18535,"year , what a talent . oscar were nominated for 9 e , mays . wonder how that works"
18536,yeah i am confused too about that . do you know how many oscars are given out ?
18537,yes there are 24 awards given over a range of categories
18538,that is quite a few of them . nice chat
18539,"hi , how are you ?"
18540,"im well , and you ?"
18541,"very well , thanks . what stood out to you in your article ?"
18542,the rankings on rotten tomatoes being used as a reliable source
18543,ha ! is that like students suing wikipedia as a knowledge source to you ?
18544,very much so . one of the students in my grad school class used it one time . you 'd figure by then you would know
18545,ha . . . hat 's funny . grad soo l ? i teach undergrad and safe a point to say wiki is not a ok source .
18546,"kids do n't try anymore , just pick up teh first result andc dope for teh best"
18547,i see that . i do ahve about 12 students that just shine . i can not wait to see what the do in their career . they are really good .
18548,what doh you teach ?
18549,i teach sport management . you ?
18550,"i 'm actually not a teacher i 'm a m , anger for refrigeration repair service company . however , i wen to orson university for undergrad and goof my bachelor 's in sports management . any idea how i can get a job ? !"
18551,get ready to start at the bottom . what do you want to do ?
18552,"yea i figured that but my mindset , while true i am probalby overstating it . , is you have to know somebody to get in . and i 'm fine at the bottom but goin unpaid would be very difficult for me financially . i have my masters in data analysis so something in the sport and data aide would eb perfect , although i am not particular , rye picky"
18553,have you thought about working for like stats inc ? ther eis such a need for statisticians in today 's sports .
18554,"i have not looked dint that avenue specifically , but i will definitely check it out ."
18555,"yeah , i seem ore and mork teams even staging their own analytics department it look for value in the numbers . billy year started a revolution and it ' foot snl , owning down ."
18556,it really is astonishing the route he took and ow quickly it blew up . i am an orioles can and they had zero analytics prior to this offseason and it obviously shows .
18557,haha . good buck . . . that would school mentality no longer works .
18558,"he really pulled a rabbit out of his hat to make th team competitive for the time they were , but i was destined to blow up sooner than later ."
18559,good luck with the job search !
18560,"hi , how are you doing this evening ?"
18561,i 'm doing well . do you ever watch or play tennis or golf ?
18562,"i 'm not really into either sport . cold is too slow and tennis , well , i just do n't understand it . i ?"
18563,"i agreed about golf . i do n't play tennis enough to really know how , but it is interesting . i wonder if it would be easier to learning with singers or doubles"
18564,"i figure with singles , i would learn from my mistakes faster . the equipment sas too expensive for me as a kid , plus here here no courts around ."
18565,"same for me growing up . now i live in an area that has a lot of courts . i ca n't imagine playing a match that lasts 11 hours though , even if it 's spread over three days"
18566,"i guess they both wanted that bonus ! 11 hours , though . did anybody watch the entire thing ?"
18567,"i 'm not sure , but there would have had to have been as least a referee or someone else , right ? i wonder if they wore polo shirts since they were created for tennis players"
18568,those shirts seem comfortable but a bit too stylish for serious athletes . i guess it 's important to eb stylin ' while bashing a ball .
18569,they mighty be have practilaity to them too for sports like tennis and ; polo . i guess polo shirt is a little more catchy than tennis shirt would be
18570,the tennis world sees to skew to the high end . they used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us one . that 's the solution i would have com ep wit how . lol
18571,"thaat 's actualy a genius solution though . maybe they 's why most courts now are n't on grass . at hte us open the year before tha t , a black man wo the title , and taht 's the on , y year a black man has won"
18572,"these power favors the rich . to get to that level , you need equipment , courts , and most o fall , coaching . black kids in hte us just do n't have access . the williams sisters seem the exception ."
18573,they seem to have a natural talent for it as well . what are the chances that two sisters would both be goods t it . have you ever heard of gael monfils ?
18574,"i think their dad pushes them i dont ' know , he was athletic . have n't heard of gael . who is that ?"
18575,"he was a quarterfinalist in the us open who only days after learning how to play , beat the ' roger federer of paddle tennis . ' natural talent"
18576,ome people just do it without thinking . i wish i had that ind of talent . why was roger federer gifted two cows over his career for winning the 2003 wimbledon adn the 2013 swiss open ?
18577,goo meat can e expensive . maybe it was to help him up his protein mistake . that 's a lot of steaks and burgers
18578,perhaps he sells the milk as a special federer line .
18579,maybe . the swiss also honored him witht an official stamp . he 's the only person to hav been given that a swell
18580,"that 's a great honor . well , i enjoyed chatting with you !"
18581,"hello . do you like , movies ?"
18582,"i do , i have a few good ones aligned for the weekend , wat about you ?"
18583,i do . i like some that are probably some the rotten tomatoes list ? did you know that warner brothers owns rotten tomatoes
18584,"no i didnt now that , i wonder if they re biased towards wb movies"
18585,me too . what is interesting is no video gmaefd film has rated above 44 percent
18586,"i guess video games are fine as is , netflix has a grea selection of movies 150 o 'the hav epa 100 percent reacting on rotten tomatoes"
18587,and they also have dark night rises on there . i guess they do n't like a lot of movies .
18588,"i love that movie , did it get a good rating ?"
18589,no it got a bad one . rotten tomatoes is for bad movies . michael bay rating is 38 percent . i guess that 's not too bad .
18590,"i think thats an ungfari rating , did you watch black panther ?"
18591,i did . it was a good movie . chadwick boseman was good in it .
18592,"he is a great actor , he really sold the part , the director of the film also fit a good job"
18593,yes and back panther had a great net worth over 500 billion
18594,"he must be like the richest hero right ? he sounds a country , tha just be good on financials lol"
18595,i do n't think any other superhero comes close .
18596,bruce wine has a net worth of 80 billion and he i insanely rich
18597,that is true . do you watch award shows ? did yo know daniel day lewis is the only actor to win an oscar 3 times . that 's great .
18598,"no i didnt know that , he is a really talented actor though , there are 24 categories in the oscars right ?"
18599,"yes , and what disney has won over 22 . taht is crazy ."
18600,"that is crazy but not suprising either , alt disney changed our cultured forever so he deserves an award ot twenty"
18601,"yes , he was great ."
18602,are you a dog fran ? there apparently is a course in dubai that requires 4 gallon sofa water ad ay to keep it green . seems like a waste to me .
18603,"i do like golf and yes itd poes seem likd a waste . the average american golf course consumes around 312 , 000 gallons of water per day as well ."
18604,wow . wonder how many golf courses there are ? i heard they take up more land space than rhode island and delaware combined .
18605,that 's a pretty incredible amount when you think about it . samuel jacskonb puts a golf clause in his film contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production .
18606,nic . love hm . babe ruth was once the most famous golfer in america . assuming it was the same time he was the most famous baseball player too .
18607,who would have guessed that ? i did n't know he was a big golf player .
18608,me neither . how about tennis ? i 'm not a huge fan . polo shirts were originally invented for tennis before they caught on with the polo crowd .
18609,that 's an interesting fact . they used a helicopter tho dry the grass tennis court for the 1969 open . bet that created a lot of wind .
18610,"that 's crazy ! the longest match in history was 11 hour sand went on for 3 days . i remember watching one a few years ago that went several hours , but 11 ! they must have had rubber legs after taht one ."
18611,no doubt 2 i wonder if at any point either player thought ' this just is n't worth it ' . there must have been big money on the line .
18612,"baba . good question . or maybe they were playing fo cows , like the ones rover federer was gifted for winning wimbledon nyt he swiss open ."
18613,what ? lol he i 'the first lavigne person in switzerland to be honored with a stamp . how neat !
18614,he also suffered the biggest injury of his career while drawing a bath for his daughters .
18615,that must have been when he tore his meniscus ?
18616,"yeah , i think so . i bet his was pissed !"
18617,"my et . that woudl have put a death in his earnings for sure . since te year 000 , federer , r rafael nadal , and novak djokovic have accounted for 6 ; event of the mens grand salem singles titles ."
18618,wow . nadal and federer once competed on a hybrid court that was ha ; f clay an half grass . i wonder ow tha worked ?
18619,that would be interesting to see . ie one if that 's on youtube ? federer has been continuously ranked in teh top 10 from oct . 2003 to nov . 2016 . what a run .
18620,"definitely . he is one of the all time great , i sure . he 's held the 1 spot in the rankings for more than 310 weeks . . . a record ."
18621,i winder who the ' roger federer of paddle tennis ' is ? a guy named paul monfils beat him to get into the us open quarterfials after learning how to play just 2 days earlier .
18622,no idea . i 'll have to look that up . been great chatting with you !
18623,i 've enjoyed chatting with you as well ! have a good day !
18624,"hello , are you a you fan ?"
18625,hi yes i like gold somewhat i think what drew mr to like this sport was from tiger woods who is a great global golfer .
18626,"yeah , he went from dominant , to a non factor , and now seems to be coming back again . he is fighting back into contention ."
18627,he really did become a non factor after that borg canal . he is trying to make a comeback but he seems to be having a rough start .
18628,"in a recent tournament h started the final round of 72 in contention , hot not as dominant as in the past ."
18629,o wow i di n't know that so i can agree not as good as past tournaments but a great start especially being tha the was away for some time he did state in a interview tha the isp fighting hard for his scores so he is still putting his all in . i do tennis waldo how out you ?
18630,"not so much h , do find it interesting that polo shirts were once invested for tennis players ."
18631,"i love it i 's so great to watch them compete with just a raced and a hollow rubber ball it 's just a intense competition to me , and polo has great clothing it is weird that they was inspired from tennis players ."
18632,"i can watch tennis occasionally , but was more interested prior to 2000 . federer , nhl , and djokovic seemingly win all the time ."
18633,roger federer is as great played he is number 3 in the red for ranking but you know hue had a huge injury in 2016 i wonder dod he ever recover and return to playing .
18634,not sure . did you know he was the first living person in switzerland to be honored with a stamp ?
18635,no i actually did n't that was probably a proud moment to be recognized and supported by you ron country he is a legend if you as me though so i can see why i mean the man won 20 grand slam titles he is a beast .
18636,for sure . i didnt realize e had the most singles victories in grand slam history .
18637,he has many but i mean heh as bee playing professional since 1998 and was ranked in the top starting in 2002 . who do you feel is better roger or tiger even though they play 2 different sports ?
18638,"probably tiger . both are great , but tiger has gran people to watch golf that are n't even golf fans . do n't think i cans ay the same for federer ."
18639,i can agree i never looked hate it or thought into it that way and i old also have to ay that tiger woods has also drawn men into joining country club more to play and enjoy the game l
18640,i would agree with that . normally when a athlete goes bart hey 're about done . but with woods sorting out his swing it might give others some hope .
18641,i just really hope he gets hi swing abc which i know he will because he has so many years into this sport i know he wo n't give up that easy and he also realizes his mistakes in his swing .
18642,"yup , i agree . well , it 's been pleasant chatting with you ."
18643,it has been such a pleasure as well we both need to keep up with the status on our old favorite professional golfer tiger winds .
18644,for sure . take care .
18645,thanks same to you
18646,did you know that all 50 states ave dinosaur fossil in them ?
18647,"i never thought about it realy , but it does n't see , surprising ."
18648,did you see jurassic world fallen kingdom m ?
18649,"yeah i did , it was a little cheesy but i love he graphics effects . did you see it ?"
18650,i did . i always like the originals better but im happy foe the lead actor .
18651,"me too , the originals are classic . i do enjoy chris pratt too though . its funny that pratt joked about the lead role si long ago ."
18652,word id you hear that the ride cost 110 million while he film cost only 3 million .
18653,"you know , i actually did hear that once waiting n into to go on the ride wh ave you ever been on the the ? '"
18654,no that 's past my time i got to stay in my lane . i hear it took 6 hours to render one game of the rain soaked trey .
18655,"yeah i ca n't believe that . honestly it 's such an iconic scene though , it was definitely worth it ."
18656,wall the raptors were n't generated by computers but had real ppl inside ;
18657,"that surprises me , i think in the first movie they were effects . can you believed dinosaurs were mesotehrms ?"
18658,well there are 20 quintillion individual animals . planet earth .
18659,"i never believed that was a real number . i think it 's really cool that the loch ness mobster is a protected species , though ."
18660,"yeah they did that back in 1912 , right ? under scottish protections ."
18661,"that 's right , really makes it wonder . i ear that domestication gives animal white forehead patches . seems unlike , though ."
18662,yeah wel germany was the first country to give animals universally constitutionallyguaranteed rights
18663,that seems very progressive i them . do you now what a blastula is ?
18664,no but it sounds like z interesing word .
18665,right ? it 's fun to say . i know it from my biology classes .
18666,1 . 5 m living animal species have been described and 1 m are insects . nice talking with you .
18667,an dtehres ' over 7 million species tha we iknow of . nice to talk to you as well .
18668,you too !
18669,"hi , do you like batman ?"
18670,i do like batman a he is a tragic and mysterious superhero . you ?
18671,"i love them to . in th i 's , universal studios had pals to build a gotham city theme park ."
18672,"i wonder how many people would hav one . it 's not a bad idea , but probably too expensive ."
18673,i bet it would have been very expensive to build . i would have had to check it out at least one .
18674,"true . batman fans would love the place . smallville was originally planned to be a show about bruce wayne becoming batman . a much darker show , then ."
18675,oh wow i did n't know that . i saw that michael keaton was so against batman forever taht even 5 million could n't sway him to reprise the role .
18676,"i guess it is not a rewarding role . thats ' a lot of money for michael keaton , too ."
18677,i bet . stan lee wrote 125 dc comics which i was unaware of .
18678,neither did k . i guess he wanted to give the d superheroes a different ; look .
18679,i guess so . do you read any comic books ?
18680,i read some wen as as young . not so much now . how about you ?
18681,not too much . i saw thats tan lee ends every phone conversation i the word ' excelsior ' l
18682,i guess everybody has their quirks . i wonder what he meant by that .
18683,not too sure . stinks that hd recently passed away .
18684,"he lived a long life , longer than most . the michigan state university library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world . i bet stan has many books in there ."
18685,he did live a very long life . i did n't know that about michigan . very cool .
18686,there are over 300 registered superheroes in the us . i wonder how are of them stan created .
18687,that 's ; pretty cool . i bet they create quite a few . those .
18688,"i agree . he probably did n't create thas one : a superhero called ' normalman , ' the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes ."
18689,it was good talking to you !
18690,did you happen to watch batman the animated series in the 90s ?
18691,"i did a little bit , burt was never familiar with who bruce i was . i never read comic book series though either ."
18692,"m3 neither , though i did watch the show alot when i was a kid . i remember batmans growing eyes ."
18693,funny how dc comics really had no other competition too .
18694,"yea , especially now with marvel ; l making better movies ."
18695,i never made the connection between batman and the suicide squad movie . makes sense now though .
18696,i 've not seen suicide squad . whats th connection ?
18697,i guess batman the animated series creator bruce timmy producer batman and harley quinn . i guess marriot robin made harley quinn popular in suicide squad . though i think marriot robin could skate anyone more popular !
18698,worked well in wolf of wall street !
18699,uh huh ! she 's amazing . i liked the batman movie with michael keaton back in 1989 . but he would not co batman forever for 15m !
18700,would hell if the first one were n't terrible . taht 's on more money back then !
18701,"yeah , and smallville was originally going to be a show about bruce wayne becoming batman . i never watched that show but it looked pretty cool . so many shows movie sand comics bout batman i never knew ."
18702,"they offer lots of origin stories now , like man o steel for superman . i hav4n'tw patched many of them ."
18703,i think these creative genius ty ; lee like stan lee of marvel comics can be a bit eccentric . he ends every phone conversation with the word ' excelsior ! ' '
18704,hah yes . rip mr . led .
18705,the dc from d comics stands for detective comics . sounds redundant .
18706,really ? i ha o aide .
18707,me either . michigan state u has hte largest publicly available comic book collection in the world too .
18708,they are a pretty large university . not real surprising
18709,here 's something interesting . there was a superhero call ' normalman ' who has np super powers . not sure how he was super . . .
18710,i guess the guy answer is hes not
18711,"hello , do you like animals ?"
18712,"yes , i do . even ' animal ' from the muppet ! do you like animals ?"
18713,i love animals . do you know how many individual animals are predicted duo exist today ?
18714,"no , i do n't . 've heard that construction over a dried up lake for an on ramp had to stop because they found more unknown biological creatures than eve before , though ."
18715,yeah i guess we are always exploring new species . there are abou 820 quintillion ones
18716,"that 's a lot ! that lake they had to stop construction over was thought to never stop slowly sinking because of all the biological matter there . speaking but hat , do you remember the dino poo scene in the first jurassic park ?"
18717,no i do not remember that but i know that th dinosaurs only appeared in it for 15 minutes
18718,i recited that when i was trying to show dino from that movie to my own ! i guess dino poo has been a really important part of how we 've learned about them .
18719,ohh interesting one . did you know the ride cost more than the movie ?
18720,i did not know that . i also didn ' realize that jurassic world : fallen kingdom was out for like a year .
18721,yeah it has been for a while . do you know how they generated the raptors in the movie ?
18722,"i think i work too much . i only knew jurassic world was out and saw it . did they use computers ? or ostriches ? , ol"
18723,"actually they used people in suits for those , must have been cheaper"
18724,so funny ! i hed when then did use computers in te movie it took hours for one frame to render for a t ex dinosaur !
18725,that is amazing . chris pratt joked about getting the lead andc actually get it years later
18726,i heard that ! i also heard they have a dung swearing scene that 's been left out of those dinosaur movies . i a n't say i as a mistake . . .
18727,yup exactly . did you know all 50 states gave a dinosaur or fossil ?
18728,"well , i remember they do have the dinosaur poo scene in the first movie . that was enough . they say we can lean more from the poo than the bones , though ."
18729,it might tell us more about them i guess . did you know dinosaurs were mesithermic ?
18730,"no , i can ever remember the period names . i love dinosaurs as a kid , too . i remember learning dimetrodons are not dinosaurs but lizards ."
18731,that is pretty cool . in canada father have a lowinthedark dinosaur coin .
18732,"hi , how are you ?"
18733,"good ! how are you ? are you a batman fan ? back in the 90 's , universal had plans to build a batman theme park . that woudl have been cool ."
18734,"i 'm good , thanks for asking . yes , i 'm a batman fan and think that theme park would have been cool !"
18735,what 's your favorie batman movie ? mine ' a th dark knight . i heard smallville was originally going to be about bruce wayne becoming batman . i guess that ended up as gotham though .
18736,dark knight also . i think christians dale isp y favorite batmans . who 's your favorite ?
18737,"yeah , he 's definitely y favorite . my least favorite was probably val kim . or clooney . michael keaton was so against batman forever har a huge payday could n't convince him to reprise she role ."
18738,"wow , i would have taken the moeny and did that movie , anyways ! but , that 's just e lol do you like comic books ?"
18739,"yes , love comic books . someday i 'd like to checkout the comic book collection at michigan state . it 's the largest public collection i nthe world ."
18740,"that 's amazing , i did n't know that . stan lee would be proud !"
18741,"gaza . yes , he would . did you kno wthe dc in dc comics stands for detective comics ? so their name is detective comics comics ."
18742,"funny , i always thought it stood for d . c . as in washington d ; c . nice to know that it stands for , finally . thanks !"
18743,stan lee used to end every phone conversation by saying ' excelsior ! ' that a character he was .
18744,"yes , he was ! great guy , i always looked for his cameo shots in his movies . , he was famous for that . i think stephen king does the same thing ."
18745,"i know stan lee is in more marvel films than any other actor . back in the day , marvel publish da generic comic book so they could trademark the names super hero and super villain ."
18746,that was super smart of them to do that ! have you ever hear of normalman ?
18747,ish ave not . what 's normalman ?
18748,"apparently , he 's the only person on a planet without superpowers and everybody eels is superheroes . kind of san od on e ?"
18749,haha . i like that idea ! that would make a great comedy setup . th marvel comic universe tale place in a multiverse set on earth in 199999 .
18750,"that 's interesting , i wonder if all the pollution on earth contributed to all these superheroes superpowers that far in the future ?"
18751,"i would n't doubt it . there was a comic series bacon fixing allot he damage created by super heroes during theirs adventures . nothing about pollution though ,"
18752,cool beans ! it 's been nice chatting with you this morning . i hope you enjoy the rest of your day .
18753,you too !
18754,"hello , how are u ? are you a batman fan ? in the 60s universal studios had plans to build gotham city , a batman theme park !"
18755,i like batman . i 've watched all the movies . i . n't believe michael keaton did n't want to do the movie for ll that money . i would have loved to see gotham city at universal studios .
18756,"gotham city wouldve been amazing , still would be , not sure why universal wouldnt go through with these plans . smallville wa originally planned to be a show abot bruce wayne becoming batman"
18757,i tried watching smllbville but never got into it . maybe i would have if bruce wayne wa sin the show . i do n't understand how russian tv was able to put ninja turtles with batman lol .
18758,"haha right . never got into smallville either , but i dont think we are missing anything . someone told me its 10 seasons and a true very end he finally puts on the cape . ; lol"
18759,wow ! yeah 10 seasons that 's a lot . reading about stan lee is interesing . the fact that he ends every phone call fish word ' excelsior ' is funny .
18760,"thats amazing ! ! htey should simulate a conversation with him so everyone can get a chance to have stan lee end the convo like that ! the d from dc comics stands for detective comics , so their company name is redundant ."
18761,i wonder how many true dc fans travel to the michigan state university to see the largest comic books collection in the world .
18762,probably everyone tha goes to common ! lol did you know the are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states . how do you even register to be a superhero ?
18763,i have no idea how someone would go about doing that . i think its comical that there is a superhero called normal man . he
18764,"yes ! haha that makes no sense though , heh as no super powers ! so is he really a superhero ."
18765,maybe just a superhero among only superheroes . going back to stan lee what a great imagination he had to have create batman ad superman .
18766,"yes , s imaginative . so sad he passed away . im sure he had an amazing life ."
18767,yea . his legacy will live forever . batman has been around for a years and i do n't see it stopping daytime soon . there was even a bartman vs . balck the gipper . batman vs . someone ; t he possibilities are endless .
18768,yeah . not to mention marvel .
18769,what do you enjoy more tv series or movies about superheroes ? i have been waiting to watch gotham .

18780,"i too ! my shoes i wear for spun class have taken on a tour poor , that i ca n't seem to et rid of , i 'll try that teabag trick and see if it helps !"

18784,"wow , did n't know that ! i read that th nokia company us to make rubber boots int eh 1800 's and apparently they still do ."
18785,wow . that 's a lot like . i did n't know that . in 1838 a man stopped to get his boots cleaned i sparks and because he nd the cleaner stood still for at least 7 minutes they became the firs people i history to be photographed !

18791,no . he could't over vote in a national election ! elmo fish the only nonhuman to testify before congress . that 's kind of odd .
18792,"yes , it is very odd ! i read today that af fantasy congress exists . have you heard of that game ?"
18793,'ve never heard if that . what is it ?
18794,"well , apparently hte players can draft congress members and you gather points based on the success of your lewis , latin reactions ."
18795,interesting ! i have to run . it was nice chatting with you . have a great evening !
18796,hello ! did you know professional blanket dancers can go through 4 pair of shoes in a week ?
18797,that is a lot of shoes and money too . there are 17 ways to tie your shoes too
18798,and i only know one way ! 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes . yo figure .
18799,yeah exactly . bill nye is the guy that holds the patent to the pointe ballet shoes
18800,"really ? that 's pretty crazy ! uggs were originally made for surfers , now they are everywhere !"
18801,nice did not know that . there are shoes inspired by the wizard of oz that take you home as they have a gps installed in them ?
18802,"lot , the things people will buy . i wonder if you check them on an app or something ."
18803,i know right ? the queen of england has people that wear her shoes before she wears the to make sure they are comfy enough
18804,that 's funny . i wonder who i swearing the queens shoes around . i also heard the only uses one shade o fnailpolish and it 's something you can just buy at a drug store .
18805,wow i guess she is very peculiar . did you know know persians were the first to wear high heels shoes ?
18806,"well , they sure started a trend ! a shoe cleaner was accidentally hte first person to be photographed in the world !"
18807,wow all . do you have a favorite kind of shoe . i really like comfy boots for the winter

18809,"he , yes it sure is . did you know prince played bowling and wore knee high boots when he played ?"
18810,sounds like something he might do . stephon marbury promoted a line of shoes that retailed 15 and was not pai to endorse them .
18811,that is odd . a guy once stole coins from a wine by taking and placing them on hi shoots
18812,interesting ! there ar three subway lines exclusively for congressmen to move from the capitol and senate offices !
18813,wow i guess they need to be separated . did you know that the congress and the presidnet ca declare someones q honorary citizen n ?
18814,"i thinkk hat happened recently , an immigrant climbed a wall to save a child . i would be wrong , but either way it 's a pretty cool concept ."
18815,yes i think that was in france or something . in the us only 7 people have won it so i
18816,"that 's pretty cool , i wonder what they did to earn it ! maybe i 'll have to look tha sup later ! anyways , it 's been a great cat !"

18822,i am not sure . i guess it may hard been a sight carted joke before real proceedings .
18823,"awesome , apparently there are fantasy congressus , i bet that is real boring stuff ."
18824,cam you actually win money with that ?
18825,i do n't know . but they also play a republican vs democrat baseball game . it ' probably not tha interesting .
18826,did you know ugg boots were invented by surfers ? who knew ?
18827,"no , weird . i would have thought they were invented by skies , would you agree ?"
18828,i would agree ; seems kind of silly . or at least some typical college girl
18829,"well they probably last longer than a professional ballet dancer 's shoes , they can go through 4 pairs of shoes a week !"
18830,and their feet look all weird for some reason
18831,well putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes will absorb hte odor .
18832,that is somthing i have to try tonight
18833,"lol , me too . i did n't know not used to make rubber boots ."
18834,i wonder why they decided to switch over to phones

18904,"hello , do you ear jeans ?"
18905,hey yes i love wearing jeans . he small pocket in the larger pocket o 'the jeans was designed for storing pocket watcher s .
18906,me too . i did n't know that was made for storing watches .
18907,yeah it must be an old school function that just stayed around because pocket watches relaly havne't that popular anymore . people dave to be careful wearing skinny jeans because they cause nerve damage .
18908,"that 's crazy . vans , north face , nautica , jansport , timberland , lee , and wrangler are all owned by the same company ."
18909,o know i did n't know that . old navy marketing with a 41 inch waist ie 6 inch waist . i find that kind of odd .
18910,i kind that odd too . levi made bing cosby a denim tuxedo after he was turned away from a hotel for wearing jeans .
18911,that 's hilarious . it is crazy to think that jeans were invented hack in 1871 .
18912,i agree . do you like shoes ?
18913,yes i love you . however they are getting too expensive these days . stephan marbury promoted a line that retailed at 15 once .
18914,teh are very expensive . did you know 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shows ?
18915,ha ha that is hard to believe . i wonder what those shoes were made from . one good trick is to put dry teabag and smelly shoe story absorb the unpleasant odor .
18916,that 's a very good trick . i 'll have to try that out sometime .
18917,some people ca n't afford shoes but nl wide receiver steve mitch leave his cleats on the wield after every game to raise awareness to homeless people without soles ?
18918,that 's pretty amazing of them . professional valley dancers can go through 4 pairs of ballet shoes per week .

18927,"oh ya i like it a lot , i like he orignal 3 the best though , the ones made from 1977 to 1983"
18928,"yeah those are the best ones , i also lilke the phantom menace , and though tthat solo : a star wars story was also interesting , its curious how the movie armed from the fourth and then started when the reaches 'the sixth one"
18929,"ya that is weird , i did n't like rogue one or the last jedi i thought they were horrible personally"
18930,"yeah i didnt lie those either nad solo wasnt great either but it was a good movie , i think the essence of the french is lost"
18931,"yup i agree , an di think james earl jones paid n't get pai enough for the first movie !"
18932,how much did james earl get paid ?
18933,"only like 10 car the first movie , thats depressing"
18934,"it is , hopefully reg ot a better deal for th mother ones , george lucas has a great imagination for supreme had a big influence on james cameron"
18935,"ya i hope so , yup i agree , also i do n't think lucas ' wife gets enough credit for the changes she made to star wars"
18936,"i agree shes a big reason of the success of the tracnise ,"
18937,"yup , she made changes liken align obi wan die , very iconic !"
18938,"yea tthat was an ice touch , i bet obi wan would disagree though lol"
18939,aha who i know he guiness hated the character in relax life so maybe not lol
18940,"he did ? then scratch that , obi wan must agree lol , you know that the 2022 century fox convinced lucas to keep licensing and merchandising rights for the franchise if he decided to forgo his directing fee"
18941,"haha i did , that probably cost the studio billions ! but it did make lucas massively rich !"
18942,"yeah they sure fretted that decision later , their lack of faith cost them millions i guess they deserve it do you like game of thrones ?"
18943,"haha nice ! i do like got btw , weird that some of the characters are related to charles dickens and charlie chaplin"
18944,"yeah that is kind of weird , you know that the actor that plays the mountain is actually only 25 years old ,"
18945,"wow that seems so young , i remember when it started back in 2011 , taht seems so long ago !"
18946,"hi , do you lke star wars ?"
18947,who doesnt like star wars ? ! love star wars !
18948,me too ! i just saw the last jedi and really liked it . i was surprised to find out that james earl jones skinny spent 2 . 5 hours recording darth vader 's lines in star wars .
18949,"he w 'the perfect choice for that voice ! teh man got paid a pittance too , i figure , since the movie was so successful ."
18950,"me too . give teh man some back end points . i bet he guts a ton of money from conventions though . i would demands t least 1m . make it worth my time , it im him . . ."
18951,"yeah , th points for the movies , the toys , the conventions , can , he could start his own film company ."
18952,i know ! in 2018 . the total value of the franchise was 65b 12 ! ! !
18953,"amazing ! i figure thay george started an empire , not an evil one though . what is he doing these days ?"
18954,nothing ! he was bought out by disney for half a gazillion dollars ! must be nice !
18955,i guess . i would n't bored . ou need something to do everyday . i think he must be involved with films .
18956,i know he is . he gets 400m in directing fees . it made him a billionaire !
18957,"yes , he sure had some foresight there . he new that toys could be worse ha lot . he had money from previous films ."
18958,i know . i wonder if they knew minerva mouse 's worth ? that 's short for minnie mouse .
18959,that is an odd name . i wonder who chose minerva . free goddess ?
18960,i am not sure . was it walter elias disney ?
18961,perhaps disney di at he worked with a lot of creative people .
18962,pixas actually named walle as a tip of the hat to him . who knew !
18963,that is a great tribute to the man who started it all . thank as a great film . i should watch it again .
18964,there was only like 4 words spoken the entire film . that crazy .
18965,"yes , i liked that fact . not poking . just visuals . very clever . anyway , great chat !"
18966,ditto ! have a great day !
18967,are you a spiderman fan ? have you seen into the spiderverse ' ?
18968,have n't been it . i wonder about the need for all these remakes .
18969,"well , this is aw woke different type of movie . miles morals is the main spidey , not peter parker . there are other nose movie for the holiday season also . ' man popping ' , ' how the grinch stole chirsmtas ' , etc ."
18970,"hte grinch nd mary popping are classics . i guess that a younger audience might want updated version so these , but i would n't . i can see that some series , like harry potter , need expansion because the fans are looking for new stories ."
18971,"yes , that is true . well i 'm a big comic book far np spiderman was created by stan lee and steve ditto . there are been 10 liveaction films ."
18972,the basic spiderman story is pretty flexible and can be reimagined with a new director and star . have you heard that term was a garfield comic book series in which garfield was a superhero ? i do n't think it would make garfield entertaining .
18973,"no , i had n't heard taht . i heard that the us military is trying to achieve spiderman like abilities for their soldiers . that 's pretty cool ."
18974,"i wonder what kind of uniform those troops would get to see . i think stan lee had a pretty interesting life , but he probably did n't understand hollywood . he ended u ; getting 0 for the first spider and movie ."
18975,"i think by the end , he was getting some good payday . joe perry , the lead guitarist from aerosmith performed hte opening for the 1990 's spiderman animated series ."
18976,"i guess joe perry las a spider man fan ! i know stan lee ended up getting 1 million per year just to stay alive ! stats ' a pretty good incentive . the number of registered superheroes in the us exceeds 300 , but i ca n't imagine all of them getting movies ."
18977,ye sit is . did you know there is a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes . that 's pretty funny .
18978,the little people behind the scenes putting everything back together . i guess that would eb a steady job . stan lee reimagined c comics characters . i thought the would be a rule against doing characters of your competitor .
18979,i did too . there are actually over 300 registered superheroes i nthe us .
18980,i wonder what superpowers are left after 300 superheroes . what is your favorite superpower ?
18981,i would love invurnability . a funny think list hat thee is a superhero called ' normalman ' . he is the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheros .
18982,"normalman . i wonder if that is considered do , or if he just got aligned at all the time . women might date him just because he was a freak ."
18983,good point there . i loved stan lee . what a creative person . he ended every telephone call wath the word ' e excelsior r ' .
18984,i bet people would call him just to hear him say excelsior . i know that marvel trademarked the names superhero and supervillain .
18985,"they did , i not sure i knew that . but , i did know that the largest public comic book collection in the world is at michigan state university ."
18986,i think the history of the medium is worth the elimination of professors . there is much to learn about american culture from comics !
18987,"well , thanks for the chat . happy new year ."
18988,are you a spider man fan ?
18989,"i am , how about you ? !"
18990,i 've been a fan since i read one of the comic books hen i was a kid .
18991,my uncle is big in the comic book industry and wax actually friends with stan lee who created spider man .
18992,that is awesome ! i might have crossed paths with him at a comic con convention somewhere . i would love to go tot he san diego one . did you know tha stab lee used to end every phone conversation he had with the word ' excelsior ! '
18993,that is hilarious . i did not . it is cool that the us military is trying to achieve spiderman ie abilities for their soldiers .
18994,that is neat ! did you know that dc stands for detective comics ?
18995,i always wondered that . crazy that there are overs 00 registered superheroes in the us . ?
18996,that disc way . the michigan state university holds the largest available comic book collection in the world . neat !
18997,thats crazy . my favorite superhero jos definitely normalman .
18998,ice ! he was the only person without superpowers right ?
18999,"new , in a planet full of superheroes . must have been boring for him ."
19000,lol there was a comic series about fixing collateral damage caused by superheroes . i 'm not familiar with that one .
19001,that is interesting . m either . there was actually a garfield book series spinoff called pet force that featured garfield an da gang of heroes .
19002,that would be neat ! i was a big garfield can when i was a kid . did you know the first comic book released in hte us was in 1933 and ware called famous funnier s ?
19003,i heard it was a sprinting of earlier news comic strips .
19004,interesting . i was n't sure of the content . i did n't know that joe perry from aerosmith performed the opening to the 1990 's spiders an animated series .
19005,that is cool . stan lee actually received nothing from the first space roman .
19006,i never new that . wow . the us military is trying to achieve spider man like abilities for the soldiers . that would eb neat to see .
19007,that would be . guess the will be able to swing from place to peace instead of using tanks ! ha
19008,yes ! lol it was nice chatting with you ! i have to get going . have a good day !
19009,do you read spiderman comics ?
19010,"no , but i watch the movies . spidey six apparently will have more than one add guy ti tanked own ."
19011,that 's cool . i really enjoyed the new animated one with his morals l .
19012,"j like the all . when spider man married mary jane in 1987 , marvel acutally had a public wedding with actors dressed in character and tan lee officiating . how cool !"
19013,i wonder if anyone ever would 've guessed that when the character was created by stan lee and steve ditto
19014,"guessed that spidey man would get married ? well , who would 've guessed that the us military would ; d try to make spiderman abilities fort heir soldiers ?"
19015,guessed the popularity of the characters . even rock stars like steve perry wanted in om the action !
19016,"stan lee gets 10 percent of the net profits from anything based upon his characters . since he died , i wonder who gets the fortune now ?"
19017,"i heard that money was still in legal limo , s since the producer claimed it didn ot make any profit"
19018,"with 300 registered superheroes to choose from , who is your favorite ?"
19019,i really loved pet force which featured garfield the at and tang as superheroes
19020,that is funny ! stan lee actually wrote 15 dc comics and reimagined many of the popular superheroes including batman and superman . he was a game .
19021,he certainly understood the nature of thos possessing supernatural or superwoman powers
19022,i wonder who wrote the comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes ?
19023,"i know in the real world , the total damage in american comic book and films since the 1930s would be measurable !"
19024,one superhero i called normalman and his was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes . i wonder if he did any damage ?
19025,"perhaps not , but with many worlds like the marvel cinematic universe in earth199999 , i guess resources are unlimited too !"
19026,di you read comics ? marvel published a ' generic comic book ' just to trademark the words ' superhero ' and ' supervillain . ' who do you root for ?
19027,"i likd many characters and would love to see the michigan state university dreary , which was the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world"
19028,do you know that dc stands for detective comics ? i did n't think of the as detectives so much .
19029,"batman was . i need to go now , so as stan lee ended every phone conversation he had ' excelsior ! '"
19030,too bad we had to say a final goodbye to lee with his passing . i guess i ' l latch some more of j . k . rowling 's new movie ' fantastic beasts . '
19031,hi are you a fan of pianos ?
19032,i know how to play one . i am not great though
19033,that 's awesome ! i could never play . i 've played around with them when i ' v been around hem and my fingers just do n't work the keys anywhere near remotely close to how they should . lol an aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship hindenburg . it weighed only 356 pounds .
19034,i would have hurt it would have been a lot more .
19035,i know right ? i 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of britain 's highest mountain and found a piano . lol wonder how it got there ?
19036,someone must have bee playing a trick on someone else . that 's what i would bet .
19037,that had to have been a task fort euro getting up there . lol freddie mercury used the same piano to record ' bohemian rhapsody ' aws paul mccartney used to record ' hey jude ' . thats kind of neat .
19038,that is kind of neat . i wonder what other cars used the same instruments ?
19039,"i 'm not sure . on april 18 , 1930 the bbc decided there was no news worth reporting , so they just broadcast ; piano music instead !"
19040,"i debt tear was funny o people . there exists a son composed solely for stress testing autopianos , a nd it is nit remotely playable by humans circus galop ."
19041,that is interesting ! do you like listening to soundtracks ?
19042,"not too much . the soundtrack to ' o brother , where art thou ? ' ia certified 8 times platinum"
19043,"that was a great one ! phil collins recorded the english , italian , german , spanish , and french versions of the tarzan soundtrack . that 's some talent !"

19067,"that is pretty funny they did not give it back ? i thin , k i the funny that the clone trooper costumes were never made just computer generated"
19068,interesting . they probably save a ton of money by doing that . the uniforms worn by the alliance on firefly ar leftover costumes from starship troopers .
19069,did you know that hugh jackman once walked around comic con in his full wolverine costume adn no one even noticed him ?
19070,haha i did n't know taht . that ? s pretty cool ! sean bean is so scared of flying that he hiked into location in full costume when filming the lord of te rings .

19077,"yes . and in 2005 , a huge man was found wandering somewhere in negan dance he could only communicate via piano , so that 's kind of like the opposite a spinal being used like a typewriter ;"
19078,"wow now tht 's an interesting allegory ; , i wonder how did they communicate . . . i mean . . . was he forming words somehow wit keys ?"
19079,who knows . it would be interesting to learn more about wht happened . did you know that mozart and haydn both owned a piano made from the sam tree ?
19080,"i really o n't know if that 's even a rare thing : , maybe all pianos were made from the same kind of tree . or maybe you mean the same actual tree ?"
19081,"yes , t he actual individual tree ."
19082,"oh well now that 's interesting ; , after all those years , how do we know it 's true ; , they did the dna tests on a tree ; , ?"

19084,"could be hey , you like stephen spielberg ?"
19085,not really . did you know that every clone trooper costume is a computer generated image ?
19086,now it is . . . but in the original star wars it waist
19087,"yes , this was for the prequels mn o physical clone trooper costume was ever produced for those films ."
19088,"what , not even a single one ? that 's hard to believe . . . there were come close ups with troopers taking of their helmets . . . they had to make at least couple of them . . ."
19089,sci is pretty advanced these day s .
19090,"no , i know that but it think it 's so much cooler to have people of storm troopers outfits on set . . ."
19091,i agree l did you know that the alien costume included real vertebrate ?
19092,wait l . . what ' but . . . was there an actor still aside ?
19093,yes . it also included rolls royale auto parts .
19094,"that had to be in early alien recent parts were probably al ; l cgi . . . i miss that movie i hope they 'll make a decent sequel . . . or prequel or whatever from that universe ; ,"
19095,yes ! i hope so ! it 's been great lacking to you ! have a good day !
19096,are you a few of the beatles ?
19097,i line heir music race in a while . they have the best selling album of the2000s .
19098,"i find that amazing considering the last album thy recorded was in 1969 ! did you know that the beatles stopped touring because sound amplifier , at that time , could not keep up over the screening ?"
19099,interesting ! do find i fascinatinalso that the beatles could n't read music .
19100,i wonder how many other major musical stars cant red music ? i ca n't read music or play either although i have an old player piano .
19101,i used to play he piano and i enjoyed n't . have you heard of the piano tht was found on hte top of britain 's highest mountain ?
19102,yeah . i remember reading about it . they found it on a litter cleaned patrol . still do n't have any idea how o why its up there ! dis you know taht a piano linked freddie mercury of queen and paul mccartney of teh beatles ? mercury used hte spinal to record ' bohemian rhapsody ' and mccartney to record ' hey jude ' !
19103,exactly ! wonder how it got there without anyone knowing . another cool piano is that one on the hindenburg airship
19104,"it was made of aluminum , so i wonder if the acoustics was significantly different that a woman piano ? what i found entertaining was that in 1930 , the bbc felt theyd ad no news to report , so they broadcasted piano music . i really wish they would do hat weekly now to help alleviate th information overload !"
19105,yeah i rarely watch the news because it is so depressing .
19106,"it can be depressing . but for me , the issue is sorting fact from fiction . it seems hard to get facts without the spin . and some take basic facts , embellish thom 1000 percent and then try to pass that fiction as ' truth ' . if i want fiction , then i will go to a movie or read a book !"
19107,you are right ! do you like science fiction ?
19108,yes . i just finished the last harry potter book . i had seen all the movies year saga l but had not read the ooszk until now . are you into lawandorder or crime novels like robert parker 's ' jesse stone ' series ?
19109,i am not really . are those good ? i really appreciate edgar allen poe . he wrote the oldest example of a fictional cyborg .
19110,"the original jesse stone novels re good . robert parker died unexpected . knew could expect that the saga would end with teh author 's death . but , a fan then starting releasing new ' jesse stone ' novels . i found this ' fan fiction ' in bad taste since he was trying to mimic , very poorly , tie original author 's style ."
19111,"yeah , i 'm not really into fan fiction . geroge rr martin says that fan fiction is copyright infringement and a bad exercise for loop , e wanting o e writers ."
19112,i totally agree . o read superhero novels or comics ?
19113,i used to when i was younger . now i mostly watch marvel series on netflix .
19114,"i recently found a wiki website olsen tha trunks fictional characters according to their powers and biliites , seems highly subjective to me . but the same can be said of a person 's taste in fictional genres ."
19115,intresting . i 'll ave to check that out . julius caesar liked fan fiction . he wrote fan fiction of hercules and oedipus when he was a kid .
19116,"i could see a child fantasizing about their favorite hero or villain and then learning to write by using their imagination . but , a adults , we should use our own creativity . like the beatles . they were orginal in their music compositions , ever if they drafted into politics rom time to tim e ."
19117,that song come together is so catchy . ; too bad it was written for politics !
19118,are you a fan of the beatle s ? i just learned that they had the best selling album of the 000 's .
19119,"i am not a have fan but that 's crazy ! especially considering how influential they were decades ago , even writing or governor campaigns in the 1960s ."
19120,"oh , you 're talking about that song come together , right ? t"
19121,"i think so ! i do n't know the details of it , but that 's the one . ome pf beatles could n't even read ."
19122,"well , they could read . they cold n't read music though , which is surprising to me because of the music they made ."
19123,they certainly just stuck with music and did n't care to adopt ' technology ' . i believe htey stopped touring cause their amplification could n't drown out the loud screaming !
19124,maybe they were just more interested in new recordings techniques . they were really unconventional in the studio .
19125,"yeah and i think they had al ot of stacks beyond their control . like ringo starr had severe suberculosis and peritonitis , i 'm sure that affected his ability to are music ."
19126,speaking of writing i just read this article about how edgar allen poe rewrote the earliest known example of a cyborg in fiction
19127,"oh wow , it 's certainly interesting here inspiration in fiction comes from . julius caesar actually wrote fan fiction for fun , i had no idea it went back that long ."
19128,"lol , speaking od fan fiction , did you see george r . r . martin rage over fan fiction ? he said it 's copyright infringement ."
19129,i did not ! it his that 's interesting . people have on fiction all the time it seems like . in the 50s a judge tried to ban a comic for featuring a black character .
19130,wow . that 's crazy . who do you think has the best super power ? i think superman . there 's a whole wiki that ranks them .

19204,the facts was really close to me
19205,i find it fascinating how our movies really speak to wat is going on in society . litle the movies hat have been released are very closely relate duo the politics and problems going on in society .
19206,the said what the current society is going n
19207,the metoo movement has really influenced the movies that have been released in the last year . do n't you think ? i think its can be both good and bad .
19208,its really good of the issue
19209,"i like that movies bring about conversation about important topics , but on the other hand a can be a little too much to hear about nothing else except the problems going om in society . sometimes , i just want to watch a madness action movie with nod keeper meaning ."
19210,yes the every had to watch it deeper meaning
19211,"i ave to say that even though i like moved , i have no interest in the awards show . they few like a waste of time and i think they have just become a political platform for a vote of people ."
19212,the watching a shows must be worth off it
19213,"as far as movies are concerned , it 's funny how they always talk about how much money they earn in the box office . those numbers always sound so outrageous . i ca n't even fathom the mount of money a movie can game in one weekend ."
19214,yes comedy shows always show a good concept
19215,"yes , comedies are always fun to watch . and they tend to be light hearted so you1 an just enjoy it and not think about a deeper mean . i wonder it comedies do well at the box office in comparison to other heres ."
19216,it really good to see
19217,"there was a movie recently with lady gaga that came out . it is interesting to see a singer cross the lines into acting . i heard it was a good movie , and i co likd he music ."

19228,the is . did you knows he retired right before the olympics ?
19229,"i did not really know this , why did he decide to do this ?"
19230,seems like it wa mostly because of a hip injury ;
19231,seems she really wanted to do her 5th olympics and fought until the end but int he end she just could n't do it .
19232,i think so .
19233,she had people who questioned and doubted her but her husband supported her . i 'm happy for that .
19234,that i good .
19235,she said it was a nemotionla time when she realized it was going to be too hard on her body .
19236,i bet . did you know she also released a line of lingerie at one point ?
19237,"haha , they were called kiss my tara . sounds kind of like it has double meanings ? i like how she said you can be famine and fast ."
19238,yes it was . do you know anything about the fifa world cup ?
19239,"i d n't know much about it . when the us competed in the first fifa world cup in 1930 , gerry got 3rd place ."
19240,yes they did . the city that is suing 542 2022 final does not exist yet .
19241,andc cities that host the world cup do n't even get the economic gain from it .
19242,i know . what do you know about wonder woman ?
19243,gal gadot did n't know that she was auditioning for wonder woman . she thought she waist testing for catwoman .
19244,"i know . when wonder woman first appeared as a member of the justice society , she wa 'the secretary ."
19245,since she 's israeli she had to serve two years as a soldier . wonder if that helped her in her lol at all .

19248,"hello , do you feel , ow soccer ?"

19250,"i have to agree , i do n't understand what is exciting about it . but most of the rest of the world relaly loves it . i wonder what it tha 2022 world cup is going to be in the doe n't ye sexist ?"
19251,"without looking it up , my guess is thay qatar is building a city to host it . high would be pretty amazing . how about ender woman ? did you see it ? what did you think ?"
19252,"i did see it , event hugh i 'm not a huge superhero movie person . i thought it was ok , but nothing that great . its always good to see a woman getting some of this superhero movie money 3d id you see it ?"
19253,i di see it and liked it . it wa during the period that my granddaughter imagined wonder woman everywhere saving people . i liked the fact that in 2017 the 3 highest grossing domestic films were female lcd .
19254,"yes , i think thats great too . hopefully that will encourage the studio to make more movies with women . i 'm surprised it was also the highest grossing ww1 movie"
19255,"it seems a stretch to call it a wwi movie , i y opinion . i would think a wwi movie would show more soldiers in battle rather than a ficticious superhero movie ."
19256,"sure . of course invest even south pacific too . , and i do n't know how you can really cat that a female led movie . or cat on a hot tin roof either , that was mainly paul neumann"
19257,"good point ! on another note , things have changed since 1941 when wonder woman was justice society 's secretary ."
19258,"i did n't know that , a lot of things have banged or the better since 1941 ! gal gadot is beautiful and i bet she could kick but in real life since he served in the israeli army"
19259,"absolutely . regarding the moon , i do n't get ow someone believer mardi 's largest moon might be artificial in origin . i may have to dig into thet one a bit . if artificial , who put it there ?"
19260,"an i 'm curious how they know its actually hollow , although that is very interesting"
19261,"speaking of the moon if you had all the money you needed , would you sign up to go to the moon on one of hose private rockets that will be going there ?"
19262,"i might consider it , bug they would have to prove to me that it as safe . and i would take a lot of convincing . how about you ?"
19263,proabably not although it is just fascinating to me how that journey has changed since usa planted its flag on th moon .
19264,"i 'm fascinated that moon dust can cut through hkevlarlike material . to my knowledge the moon is aide up of the same stuff as the ear , so i may have to look that up"
19265,the ear ? ? wa rand al ?
19266,i meant the earth ! also ive never heard of moon hay fever .
19267,me neither . i suppose i do n't need to worry too much about it since i wo n't be traveling there .
19268,"good talk , thanks"
19269,do you think gender and race are equally worthy of attention in judging films ?
19270,i think they are both very important issues and essential in the progression towards equality
19271,should the oscars cosnidert here factors on an equal basis gwen making awards ?
19272,"yes , i think these factors sould be considered on an equal basis though perhaps how the movies present the issues and bring awareness to them is more important ."
19273,"i agree with that . what abou box office draw , should that be considered in the oscar evaluation ?"
19274,"id o n't thing it should , though it probably does have impact on the oscars . what do you think ?"
19275,"i think thati hat people like to see should have an impact . after all , they pay to see the movie , the critics get in free ."
19276,"ha . that 's true . have you watched any of films that present social justice issues , like the public or hte hate u give ?"
19277,"no , i 've missed those , kinda on purpose . i like documentaries but not that up ."
19278,social justice movies are kind of depressing . the only movies i watch are cartoons with my kids .
19279,"now , i do n't much care for animation though i did like ferdinand . i like drama and scifi and some horror , some action adventure ."
19280,do you usually watch the oscars ?
19281,"no , i do look at the end carpet stills the day after though ."
19282,have you watched the old man and he gun ? lot is a 20182019 oscar hopeful .
19283,"no , i have n't seen hat . what 's it about ?"
19284,i looked i the and it 's about a 7 year old making an escape from san question nad connecting various heist .
19285,"oh , yeah , i remember hearing somehting . i do n't know that it would be too appealing to me ."
19286,it sounds quite humorous but i bet it is filled with a lot of action .
19287,"oh , i did't realize i that a comedy aspect to do . i 'll have to check out rotten tomatoes !"
19288,"oh , i 'm not sure that it does . i just thought it was funny that an ' old man ' was mulligan off lots of heist after escaping from prison . so you like comedy but not action ?"
19289,"no i like action just not when it glorified criminals . hey , nice chatting with you ."
19290,"hi m , do you know much about the box office ?"
19291,"in fact , i was recently studying up on box offices . how about you ?"
19292,"i know a little bit . with over 8 . 5 billion worldwide in film earnings , tom hank sis the highest alltime box office star ."
19293,the fun is a money machine . he has hte golden touch . he could just stand the and the money wold flow in for a film .
19294,i agree . did you know disney once thought about shutting down its animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure ?
19295,i guests they expected toa always make money . many of those animated miles have been popular for decades . term is a long curve .
19296,is aw th movie the trojan wars had a budge to 15 million and only earned 309 in the box office . talk about a failure .
19297,"whatnot he saying ? ' nobody know anything . ' hollywood execs just ca n't predict . adjusted for inflation , the original star wars trilogy outezrned the prequels that the domestic box office by 1 , 328 , 009 , 800 . that 's insane ."
19298,wow that 's crazy ! disn3y'ds treasure planet was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time .
19299,"somebody lost tshirt job over that one . sometimes i'ts diferent by country . despite ; john carter ' being considered am onumentla flop for disney , it actually broke box office records in russia"
19300,oh wow that 's pretty cool . i saw silence of the lambs came out on valentine 's day in 59 and had a box office of over 270 million .
19301,"a perfect day movie . the blood , the dread . perfect !"
19302,haha i bet ! do you like birds ?
19303,i liek to eat them . not much else . lol
19304,lol ! the dodo bird is actually a subfamily of the pigeon .
19305,i guess ' dumb ' runs in the family then .
19306,i guess so lo . some birds fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when they are migrating .
19307,i do n't understand how they can fly without sleep . amazing .
19308,me either . such an amazing feat .
19309,pigeon mar one of 3 birds that produce milk for their young . i did n't know that birds produced milk . i thought that was only mammals .
19310,"wow l , i did n't know that either . it was great talking to you !"
19311,"hi , how are you ?"
19312,"i 'm doing good , how about yourself ?"

19314,i do ! did you ever that julia marcus retired ? she was such a great skill !
19315,i had never hear of her before but it sounds like she will be missed !
19316,i remember seeing her in the 2010 and 2014 games . she was really good . itll e goo for her body though . she just had hid surgery not goo long ago .
19317,"lindsey jonn just retired too , or at least announced it . it sounds like us skiing is going to have a leadership vacuum that will need to be filled . . ."
19318,yep 'm sure heres ' some greats waiting in the wing . it 's crazy they 're not 34 . it goes to show that athletes endure so much that it 's herd to compete int their 30s .
19319,"i worry about their long term health . i know a lot of exfoobtall players that the going through a lot of physical pain , let alone brain issues ."
19320,it has to be a rough life . it 's hard to beat on youth body andc rain to be the best ever day .
19321,yeah . the recovery time on a lot of them is a long time even with baseball it takes a few months to recover from a 162 game season .
19322,"i can imagine . i get soccer players have aw hard time recovering too . i 've never played , but watching the world cup marks me tired bt hey 're always moving , sprinting , stopping . it has to take a toll ."
19323,"yeah , t hey have to run about 10 miles a game , no ?"
19324,"i think so , id o n't in like driving 10 miles , much less running . they have to b in incredible shane ."
19325,yeah . like gal gadot in ponder woman . have you seen that movie .
19326,"i have not . i 've been wanting to see it , 9 just have n't had the time l it seems to . pretty good ."
19327,"yeah , i thought gadot was perfectly cast . j think almost everyone enjoyed it , that i talked to about it ."
19328,i will definitely have to check it out .
19329,it was he highest grossing super hero origin movie .

19334,they ar cunning little thieves arent they ? lol . i gues they are too quick to stop . they make what they want and it away .
19335,yes they are so tiny and like you thirds their bones are hollow so that their entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers !
19336,that makes sense . hollow bones are lighter but also stronger . interesting how evolution produced that .
19337,"yes as a skydivee i win i could fly like a bird , though i will say i prefer flying jetblue over flying from alaska to mexico without sleeping while migrating"
19338,i cant imagine how birds do that . they must have some calm sleeplike state or something .
19339,and it has to be tiring ! that is a long flight ! ! ! ! !
19340,it sure is . worse than flying in economy class . i respect the birds for their stamina . its cute that they can imitate machines and stuff .
19341,yes parrots are great imitators i saw one on facebook which kept insulting firefighters when they were trying ti rescue it .
19342,that is great ! i bet the firefighter appreciated that ! ' hey ! we ? 're trying to save you ! ' '
19343,hahahahahha for sure they hound sell tickets to parrot shows at thee box office watch them try and talk to alexa or something
19344,lol . that would be fun ? do you like lady gaga ? i dont know her well .
19345,i do not know a lot about her . do know he name came about from an autocorrect
19346,that is funny . late gaga . she sure can sing . she likes iron maiden .
19347,she is really popular so popular in fact that the lapd asked her to tweet out info abot road construction
19348,she is followed by so many . i think that was good thinking by the lapd . she would probably want to help . goo do her .
19349,elon john chose her as his son 's godmother what says a lo about what type of person she is
19350,"she must get respect from other musicians . anyway , great chat !"

19358,"as wonder woman , she was in 2016 bartman vs superman"
19359,"oh , ok , so she does a lot of superhero films . i bet she a good athlete too ."

19364,"well , aruba man wool pet all the paperwork we . . . gadot did not even know she was auditioning for wonder woman . . . she thought she was going for catwoman . . ."

19366,"i agree ! did you see her in the movie , wolf ? i would hope at te moon with her anytime !"
19367,i did not . wait . was jack nicholson in that ? maybe i did .

19369,"il ike the moon , but not enough to know lat it . maybe im just not a fan ."
19370,"well , maybe you have not met the right moon ? there is evidence of methane based life on titan , a moon of saturn . who knows . . ."
19371,i guess that we could send some people out there . maybe safest . the moon . moon dust cut through kevlarlioe material and is harmful to human

19405,"thats and cool , you can rent out certain items ."
19406,"yes , items like sewing machines and things people find useful gt do not need for long term ownership ."
19407,it looks like there is an annual contests amoung authors to come up with the worse opening line to a book .
19408,that sounds like it woudl be fun to be a part of .
19409,"architecture , literature , music , painting and sculpture were olympic events for awhile lol"
19410,"boy , they nee duo bring that back . uk prime minister gladstone had a personal book collection of 32 , 000 books tht he donated to the library by wheelbarrowing tiem ."
19411,wow ! that is amazing . too had they couldnt find a more secure way to transport the book . hold o you know winston churchill ?
19412,"i guess it was his wishes to do so that way . yes , i am familiar with wc . ,"
19413,he has a new prize in literature .
19414,oh that is interesting since those are usually considered to be associated with peace .
19415,yeah . i hear if you publish a book in norway the government buys 1000 to donate to libraries .
19416,that sounds pretty generous !
19417,"i knw right ! this is funny , dr . seuss 's editor bet im 50 he couldnt write a book in 50 words or less . . . the editor lost the bet lol ;"
19418,i like that bet ! did you knoe children 's books have ore rare swords than average adult tv ?

19422,i 'm great thank you . there are more libraries than mcdonald 's in the united states .
19423,i cna't believe it ! we love our fast food more than reading ! maybe if we combine the two .
19424,i agree e .
19425,"we cult have a fast food section at every library , or a library section at every mcdonalds . it would be great !"
19426,haha do you like literature ?
19427,"yes , i do like literature , though i do not understand it . i think that it is for people smarter than me ."
19428,the fda burned six tons of literature in an act of us censorship .
19429,i think that is appalling . who are they to decide what i ca n't read ? that is not for the gov't .
19430,i have no idea lol . i agree that it 's appalling .
19431,i think that the govts should encourage peopple to read ridley . that us the job of gov ' y . are we all children here ?
19432,i thinks o too . romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient greek literature .
19433,i ca n't imagine that . maybe people breath was stacking .
19434,i ca n't imagine that either .
19435,i figure that maybe kissing is something that only humans do . maybe it is natural . i wonder what other kicks secrets can be found n literature .
19436,"if you publish a book in norway , the government will buy 1000 copies and distribute them to libraries throughout the country ."
19437,i will move to norway then . i will write many children 's book and publish the and marry a beautiful woman and have many children .

19450,"yes i have , very funny movie . that was a classic cringy there . thanks"
19451,"i have never seen it before , i think bill murray said it was comedy gold or something like that ."
19452,k agree . did you know that some of th very first silent movies ou there were comedies ?
19453,"i did , charlie chaplin was great . it wa amazing that they did n't even have to talk to make people laugh"
19454,you 're correct those types of movies were all visuals and they did n't require ny sound whatsoever .
19455,for sure ! do you like comedians ?
19456,i do like comedians do you have someone in mind ?
19457,"demetri martin and ryan stiles . one is a drop out of high school and one is a drop out o law school , both successful and funny"

19461,"i would have paid to see that ! lol , they should make it now . it was so nice chatting with you , i hope you have a great night !"
19462,do york no much about mr shakespeare ?
19463,i dont know much about shakespeare . lay some wisdom on me !
19464,i was hoping these am . i guess we ' v become to an impose . i do not he is the inventor of the of the names we now commonly use .
19465,thye created a ton of words . shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today .
19466,"i guess we owe him a lot , if you are into words that is . i know he wrote some comedies , i 've been told by som ethan know that you wo n't get much of a laugh from them ."
19467,"yeah , i bet . we dont early now his culture or setting . his works team on a different meaning when performed with an eraappropriate accent instead of a modern one , often introducing rhymes or puns that do n't work in modern pronunciations ."
19468,"that sounds like too much work for me , i just want to long on a dvd and watch some bill murray ."
19469,"yes , i figure bill is more the taste of the modern man . do you grease with his thinking on kung fu hustle ?"
19470,"i have not see it so ca n't pass judgement , irma missing there is some tongue in cheek action there . was he is that one ?"
19471,"is , he wasnt . i expect he was being facetious . i have n't seen the film . ive heard good things , but is it the pinnacle of comey ? i do it ."
19472,"oscar wilde seem to have considered himself a comedian , i have nothing to declare but my genius . either he 's a comedian or he rally was full of himself ."
19473,"he was both . the man wrote some great plays , adn was quite popular . but he was a bit pompo7s too ."
19474,"i once saw a version of the importance of being largest in the theater , i guess the ' y call it a comedy of manners . is now there have been a couple of comedy movies version made ."
19475,"yeah , i read that in high school . i liked it nut it is more fun to see it performed ."
19476,di you real ; y think his last words were about a dual with hi wallpaper to theyd heath . sounds go good to be true .
19477,"the m , snl hid some weird predictions , but i think it comes with being an artist 2k dissing oscar wilde 's lipstick covered tomb could suit in a 12 , 000 fi e ! what is up with that ?"
19478,"i once went to see it with a friend , in the same cemetery as jim morris i believe . people have turned the place into a shrine with messages and gifts all over te place . lots of graffiti ."
19479,"ah , that is why here is a fine . i guess he is beloved figure and people want to pay . . . respect ?"
19480,"if they live to have a fine for kissing it there must have been handed , if not thousands hat have . i think i 'd want to keep my lips well away from that ."
19481,"yeah , boy , who knows what is during on that gravestone . anyway , great chat !"
19482,"have a good day , or evening . i 'm going to go and stream kung fu hustle now . bye ."
19483,have a good evening g ! enjoy kfh
19484,bye
19485,"how 's it going , have you ever heard of the movie ' who paid the piper ' ?"
19486,"i have n't heard of it , what is it about ?"
19487,"it 's is based on how the cia started a cultural war to stomp out communism m , sounds like it 's an interesting flick"
19488,that doses sound interesting . do you ride the subway often ?
19489,not unless i 'm in a major city like nyc or dc . the subway in dc have exclusive subway lines for congressmen
19490,that sounds pretty convenient ! did you now elmo was the only non human to testify before us congress ? i wonder what that was like . .
19491,"lol no , i wonder what congress had elmo testifying about"
19492,i have no idea . the first woman who was elected to congress could n't even vote . that 's pretty surprising !
19493,neat 's a shame that women couldnt even vote in a national election back in 1916
19494,"yeah , it is . it 's crazy that so many things like that were happening and not even that lol ago ."
19495,"yea , it 's crazy how far the us congress as come since it was started in 1789"
19496,since 1909 congress has had a baseball game with republicans vs democrats . republicans are currently in teh lead .
19497,"i 'm surprised republicans only have 3 moe wins in the baseball game , for some reason i figured they woul dave won mover"
19498,"yeah , baseball does seem like a rspulbican sport for some reason . do you like to read ?"
19499,"yea , i never knew churchill won a nobel prize in literature , i want to check hat book out"
19500,sounds pretty cool . did you know romantic kissing is fairly new and wa never nation ink greek literature e ?
19501,"no , it 's kinda odd greek literature did n't hve much kissing considering how liberal they were with sex"
19502,"yeah l , kissing is kind of a weird concept though when you think about it . there is a contest where writers try to some up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel . i wonder what it is ."
19503,"hmm , coming up with the worse opening line in a novel actually sounds quite challenging"
19504,"yeah , i 'm betting some of them and pretty funny ."
19505,"well i have to go , nice chatting 9th you"
19506,i enjoy reading u how about yourself ?
19507,"hi , i do . i was actually reading a book written by winston churchill , after i finished it , i realized he won a nobel prize for it !"
19508,"i just recently discovered that he won a nobel for literature but not peace which is the opposite of what ti woul , it have thought ."
19509,yes . he was before my time so i only really knew abut his actions as pm . old books are interestin gf i ancient greek blood there are some weird romances but they rarely mention kissing for instance .
19510,i had also heard that . apparently romantic kissing is a fairly recent development . i wonder why that is ?
19511,"no idea , i 'm sure you can find the answer i a book . unless it 's been destroyed ."
19512,"ugh , that always upsetting . the fda burned six tons f literature in the us as an act of censorship . what aw sure . it makes me so angry ."
19513,"yeah , a lot of those can never eb recovered . fortunately these days with e books it 's virtually impossible to destroy literature as a digital copy will always remain ."
19514,i certainly hope they it n't find a way . have you heard that there is a yearly contest tat challenges writers to come up wih the worst opening sentence for a novel ?
19515,"i have not , but you 'd think it would n't be too difficult do do . there are some pretty bad books out there . this is non fiction but i was just reading about bots if you can believe that . i thought it would be bad but it was interesting ."
19516,oh really . what was an interesting fact you came across ?
19517,nokia used to mark reboots ! that 's what they were known for . given how their phones have gone lately maybe they should go back to boots .
19518,what ? ! i never would have expected that . here 's on . do you know why ugg boots were invented ?
19519,"yes , that was in the book the . for surfers to keep their feet warm . you would n't think boots are interesting but honestly i was fascinated learning about them ."
19520,you would think they would absorb a lot of water and become uncomfgortabel . they do not seem very water reoellent .
19521,the earlier modelo were a lot different the the uggs of today . before truck farmers used to make itll reboots for turkeys they 'd walk to markets . you would think a wagon or something like that would be mardi efficient .
19522,"ha ha , boots for turkeys . taht is a hilarious image . i would love to see that ."
19523,i just do n't see how that would have been cost effective . especially with the turkeys sold fdr meat one they reach their destination .
19524,me either . do you know what the phrase ' pulling oneself up by their bootstraps ' used to mean ?
19525,"no , i do n't think that was mentioned . the book , but i am curious . . ."
19526,it originally meant ' doing something that is pretty much impossible ' . that 's very interesting because it 's certainly not quit now we use it now .
19527,seen williams really checked out the umpire at the last us open tennis tournament .
19528,i heard about that it was like she had a meltdown that day or something ; .
19529,it started when she was accused of receiving coaching .
19530,i was really surprised a ther for smashing her racket which causes er to be realized a point it was just so unlike her .
19531,the umpire was n't happy about that .
19532,she should n't have callled him a ' thief ' and demanded an apology .
19533,tennis fans do n't take well to that . they booed er conduct .
19534,did n't they both they both get booze dat te trophy presentation ceremony ?
19535,i 'm not sure why they woudl boo osama .
19536,"i 'm not sure , but she made a speech stating to gives everyone thee credit where credit is due . let 's not boo anymore , and to congratulate noti ."
19537,that was the right thing to do . but the umpires are still upsets t hte situation .
19538,she really shouldnt ave acted like that . it was ' every professional .
19539,"but people like billy jean king say there is a double standard , that umpires are much more tolerant of that kind of behavior from men ahh from women ."
19540,ifr a they have threatened to boycott williams 's future matches
19541,i one if that wil ; come to pass .
19542,the umpires believe they ar ewing abandoned y the gta .
19543,umpire ramos is very well respected . other umpires wonder if they could end up liek him .
19544,"i know they feel that no one has their back when they make unpopular calls , but they have to understand that happens in every sport ."
19545,"when you are a referee , you take cuff from everyone ."
19546,"that is very true . hopefully will , ms will be smart and not to that stuff again ."
19547,"good talking to you , enjoy the holidays ."
19548,"good morning , are you a tennis fan ?"
19549,i am ! i love the williams sisters . i feel like they got a pot of flak but they 're amazing
19550,they are two of the most dominant players ever . i think they draw a lot of unfair criticism because of how good they are .
19551,"true . i think it also has to do with sex and has . serena was criticized some time ago for ' having a meltdown ' in an exchange with an umpire but i 've seen much , much , much worse from other players and they do n't get criticism about it"
19552,stat is partially true but serena does have a habit of losing her temper on the more . i think she puts a lot of pressure on herself and can sometimes flash out when thing soon ' f go her way . i believes he once threatened a tennis judge before that incident .
19553,have so . it must be hard being her ws he wa sin the hospital latter giving birth lane phd blood cloths join her lungs and the doctors would n't like unto her until it was almost to late . she often has to ' act out ' oh e heard
19554,"i really felt bad for her opponent in that match , she had her big moment overshadowed"
19555,"that 's the . or maybe its brought hear more attention ? w hen you have a huge tennis star like serena williams freaking out over your move , that tells people you did pretty well . . ."
19556,usually i would say that is true but i would be curious to see how many people could name her opponent in that match versus ow many just remember that there was controversy .
19557,"good point ! i only jist learned that i was noti osama , meanwhile i heard about this incident so long ago"
19558,hopefully for serena 's sake she can learn to express herself in tough situations likes om hornet big time athletes in stressful situations . i do n't remember steph curry every thing a bad moment such as this during his career . he seems to keep coo blunder pressure .
19559,i do n't even know who he is . or if he should be weighing in o this
19560,"he 's one of the best basketball players in the league today . as a contemporary black athlete and a big advocate for women in sports , i think he has a valid opinion for this ."
19561,"speaking of serena , she coowns the miami dolphins"
19562,i remember when ted dolphins were sled an the brought in a lot of celebrities to invest as part of the group . i believe mar cannon and jlo lso rave part ownership of thet team .
19563,i ' done to have enough money to invest in a sports team . do you know if they 're any good ?
19564,the dolphins have not been very good lately . they just bought in ne coaches so maybe why ban start to turn it around .
19565,"you seem to know more about sporty that me . how do they compare to the golden starter warriors ? mil limited knowledge tells , e that they 're good lol"
19566,the golden state warriors are more like the new england patriots if you want a football comparison . both teams are dominant and constantly n the hunt for championships .
19567,"wait , are the miami dolphins and golden state warriors not even teams of the same sport ? ?"
19568,no they are not . the dolphins are a football team and hte warriors fan a basketball team .
19569,"i should know this stuff . i have a sibling in san francisco , but i 'm not big into baseketball or footbal myself , thought i do know all about the pats and tom brady !"
19570,"steph curry is pretty much the tom brady of the nfl right now , he 's the player you want in the big game . it was fun talking sports with you , have a great day !"
19571,"nice talking with you , too !"
19572,do you know who stars in ' sorry to bother you ' ?
19573,"no i do n't , do you ? is that a movie ?"
19574,"i heard it was keith stanfiedl , n ut am not sure . that is a movie ."
19575,"oh ok , i will have to check it out . do you know much about the usa congress ?"
19576,a litle . i kno other are three subway lines exclusively for congressmen to move between the capitol and offices .
19577,yeah is n't that an interesting fact . i wonder what year and was they decided to come up with that .
19578,it is probably a recent thing . certainly after the start of th annual republican or democrat baseball game in 1909 .
19579,that would actually be pretty fun to watch or go back in time and watch them of those games in the early 1900 's .
19580,"i would like to see the one from 1916 , when the firsts roman was elected to congress ."
19581,yeh i would like to see that as well . i would live to see how fast they pitch to each other !
19582,not sure . did you know ther eis also a fantasy congress league !
19583,"area ; 'll , i wonder how you would even score pointes i a league like tat . can you imagine people getting into a fight over their fantasy congress league as well ?"
19584,"points are based off of legislative success . i know if i were in a fight over a fantasy league , i would take of my boots !"
19585,that is just too funny to me . did you know the elmo once testified before congress ?
19586,that is pretty funny . does elmo wear rbg boots ?
19587,"that i ca n't tell you , but i dot knw why he would have to come in . at least the character , but i think i remember when that happened actually ."
19588,true . k know some of the muppet would wear rubber boots like those nokia used tom fake .
19589,"yea i never knew that about nokia , who would have thought . dig suess them still make them ."
19590,i wonder if they ever made boots or turkeys ! ay quarter million turkeys used to be walked from norfolk to london in custom boots .
19591,"really , i wonder why in the world that would happen ! but i guess people ware reaaly weirdo dnc do weird things for fun ."
19592,"it was probably the easiest way to transport them ? i agree , its rounds like something out of literature ."
19593,"yeah it does . well it was nice chatting with you today , 8 hope you have a good day ."
19594,"hi there , what kind of footwear do you like ?"
19595,"hello ! i have a lot of boots , what bout yourself ?"
19596,"yes me too , very handy for when the winter comes . hav you headed of uggs ?"
19597,i have ! i surf occasionally and they keep keep my feet warm .
19598,do you know how they were invented ?
19599,i think i general surfers invented them . feel their feet warm after getting out of the ocean . they certainly work !
19600,yeah . do you know what pulling oneself up by the bootstrap'smeans ?
19601,"i believe ot 's based off of doing something pretty much impossible , you really ca n't actually pull ourself up by bootstraps ."
19602,"yeah , exactly . did you know no originally aide boots ?"
19603,"i didn ' now that , do you know if they still do that ?"
19604,they still make rubber boots yes
19605,boots have a lot of interesting history in general . i believe the first people to ever be photographed were a man and the cleaner cleaning his boots .
19606,"yes , i think that is correct . do you like literature ?"
19607,"i definitely do , i think literature is a forgotten form of a . it actually used to be an olympic event for some time ."
19608,"yeah that is so cool , it still should e , along with musi painting and sculpture"
19609,there 's still contests for it though . i know there 's an annual contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst pissibel opening sentence to a book .
19610,i would like to read those really . di you kow the fda burned six tons of books in an act of usc censorship ?
19611,"i did n't know that , that awful . reading has experienced a lot of changes . i heard romantic kissing is still a new development in reading ."
19612,yeah it seems so . in ancient greek literature it was rarely mentioned
19613,the state of literature has certainly improved now . winston churchill once won a nobel peace prize for literature .
19614,"go figure , stat guy was talented really . nice chatting with you"
19615,i know a lot of people may not but i actually enjoy reading shakespeare . how about yourself ?
19616,the actress olivia wilde changed her name as aw tribute to the irish poet and playwright . a nice tribute yes ?
19617,a ferry nice tribute . id id not knot hat . were you aware that shakespeare invented many of the phrases we use today such as ' good riddance ' ' l laughing stock ' ' devil incarnate ' and ' as luck wold have it ' ?
19618,shakespeare has a law body of work that we can read . 39 plays . i find the language a little difficult at comes . there are some hidden jokes that are clever puns . they get lost as english changes .
19619,it 's always hard when starting but you get caught in the rhythm pretty quickly . it 's hard to believe that he was alive at the same lime ad pocahontas .
19620,"labs , poor pocahotna , i knw her well . i would like the idea og my skulls ewing used in hamlet to play yorick . it would be funny , but i would know nothing ."
19621,"ha ha , hamlet is probably my favorite shakespeare work . i visited it in college and even it . i was very surprised to learn that he invented the names miranda , jessica , and olivia . we use those names so much now and then seem so simple compared to most of his names ."
19622,i wonder if we really know the man shakespeare was ? there are few records . we read his works and presume to know that he thought . few records for commoners from the day . unlike our lives which will have records forever .
19623,that 's a good question . i would be interested in learning more about that . we always think of drama with shakespeare bet he also wrote comedies . do you enjoy comedies ?
19624,"i always appreciate comedy . have learned that some movies are referred to as bromatic comedies . i dont like the name , do like the movie . harold and kumar was funny ."
19625,i like lots of those . i like step brothers and i love you man a lot . i like demetri martin 's standup . he was accepted into harvard law school but decided to do standup instead . he always seemed very intelligent to me .
19626,"i do not know who demetri martin is . dropping out o school alto pursue comedy is a common thing though , ryan stiles is a funny guy . he was on the drew cary show a while ago ."
19627,"i definitely remember him . tall , slim man . i love all murray so much . are you a fan ?"
19628,bill stray is the man . dogs an dwts sleeping together . i have never watched kung fu hustle . i need to look for that . you know it ?
19629,eh is amazing . he is a huge fan of kung fu hustle ; i have seen it . it 's okay but i 'm going to have to disagree with him on how good it is . it 's really not that great .
19630,"i will keep that in mind . there are many levels to comedy . some is pure visual , some is strictly words . it is funny to think about the three stooges , buster keaton , slapstick keith and without words ."
19631,that is true . kung fu hustle is very visual and slapstick heavy . i realized that 3rd rock from the sun noon the olden globe for best comedy series in 1997 . that is surprising .
19632,"3rd rock beating seinfeld , friends and frasier . four grea comedy shows airing in the same year . network tv was at its height . now things are fracture by internet channels . great show though ."
19633,i did enjoy it but it certainly did not hold up as well as seinfeld or maybe even friends .
19634,"i do agree that 3rd rock is most showing in reruns . seinfeld , friends and even frasier live on in reruns . seriously , i still see them while channel surfing . anyway , i have nothing to declare by my genius ."
19635,i definitely agree . i believe that you just quoted oscar wilde . great quote .
19636,hi how are you ? are you a fan of bill shakespeare ?
19637,"yes i do like shakespeare , he though he was born a long time ago i think he was very talented , it 's crazy taht he was born in 1564 !"

19714,everyone would be so down on him . he seems to be a legit good person . do you like his movies ?
19715,i like his films generally . i think that he was good range . he can do comedy and drama . i think it 's cheesy that he ends his emails with a pun . that 's totally a dad move .
19716,i like his films . he had a run of a few really films . castaway was one of them .
19717,his films have generated 8 . 5 billion worldwide . hanks is a bankable star . disney should put him in star wars .
19718,i saw that they just released the last jedi on netflix . i am so excited to watch it . do you like star wars ?
19719,i liked the first three films it i twin there are too many films and it ' difficult to keep track of things . i dunno . maybe i 'm old .

19730,"i would be able to ma , ike it word hahha bruce wayne 's es5timation is 80 billion ."
19731,that 's got ta be one cold bat cave with only 10 ! do you think of hanks would have made a good batman ?
19732,i really like his voice but not sure if he would make a good batman . what are your thoughts .
19733,nothing scares me less than tom hanks . i would be into his loving arms if i saw him in a dark ally !
19734,hahahah i love that . did you know that he refuses to play bad guy roles in films .
19735,"see , just a great guy ! plus he makes such good movies . the have made over 8 . 5 !"

19746,i love all the super hero movies but black panther might be my favorite . did you know dorothy steel made her film debut in this movie ? and she is 91 !
19747,"no way , i ad no idea ! that is a pretty neat going to get off a bucket list at 91 yrs ole . i have that the richest superhero is the black panther , who is estimated 500 billion . bruce wayne is only at 80 million and been around a lot longer ."
19748,that is impressive ! are you a tom hanks fan ?
19749,"yes , he cracks me up ! i like that he refuses to play bad guys in the movies he chooses ."
19750,"yeah , he has been in so many great movies . i really liek big and the green mile . do you have a favorite ?"
19751,that is true . the has so man great movies but i really love mr . banks . that was his more recent film and the first actor top play walt disney in a mainstream film .
19752,i have n't seen that one ye . how was walt disney portrayed in that movie ?
19753,it was a very nice feel good movie with a hysterical feel . tom hanks has over 8 . 5 billion in worldwide film earnings . he is actually the highest alltime box office star .
19754,i would think he would be . he has been in the so many great high grossing movies . i have seen most of his movies and the only one i did not like was turner rand hatch .
19755,"yeah , good point and that was a long time ago . you never know what movie will be a hit . do instance the movie trojan wars only grossed 309 but had a budge of 15 billion"
19756,it is hard to predict that will be a hit . i heard tom hanks was originally cast as mario in a super mario loved . i do n't think that would have been good for his career .
19757,"ha , oh funny and i agree with you . disney has also had some hits and flops . the disney movie treasure janet was the most expensive flop of all time for them . i never saw it though ."
19758,i do n't even remember treasure planet and my wife loves disney movie sad makes me watch them .
19759,that says a lot of h ! i really liked beauty and the beast but ish beard it wash huge failure and they also closed down the animation portion because of it .
19760,beauty and the beast is my wife 's favorite . mine is lion kin g ; do you have a favorite disney movie ?
19761,"yeah , mine is beauty nd the beast , i fore everyone to watch it about twice a year at my house ; . asu ar as tom hank gues , i really want to watch apollo 1 again . i have n't seen it since it came out in 1995 ."
19762,"fort om hanks , i would probably say the green mile , i am ah the fan of stephen king books which that movie is based ,"
19763,"oh , yeah thati as super weird and cool . it was a stephon king scary movie made vey cool by tom hank . thanks for the in chatting , i am gon na have a movie day now ."
19764,"sounds good , nice chatting with you"
19765,"thank you , same to you !"
19766,"hit here , do you like spiderman ?"
19767,"i d , he 's one of my favorite superheros ."
19768,phd has a hyphen because stan lee did n't want him confused with superman . i guess i wrote it wrong . should be spiderman .
19769,"that 's pretty interesting , stan lee was an amazing ma ? did you know that in 1998 marvel offered the cinematic rights to all of it 's characters to sony for a few 325 million ?"
19770,yeah and sony rejected it and only bought the rights to spiderman !
19771,"that 's crazy , bu i think they both did well on the deal ."
19772,do you know madame web ? stab lee 's wifi did her voice in hte 94 spiderman series .
19773,i did n't know that . did you know the broadway musical ' spiderman : turn off the dark ' is the most expensive production nine broadway history ?
19774,"seems liken he music would be good . too bad her were too many injuries on set , soo that they had to shut down because they could n't get injury insurance anymore ."
19775,yeh the music and lyrics were written by bono sas n't it ?
19776,"yeah , i heard that . superheroes cause a lot of damage in their universe . there was a comic series about fixing their collateral damage ."
19777,that 's pretty cool . rid you know there is actually a superhero called ' normalman ? '
19778,hat can he do ?
19779,"basically nothing , he was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes ."
19780,"wow , i 'd be nervous if i wee him . in real life there are also 340 registered superheroes . wonder what needed to register ."
19781,"i 'm not sure , that does seem like apt ."
19782,"my kids like this garfield book series spinoff , called pet force . garfield and the gang are superheros . hav eyou heard of it ?"
19783,"i have not , it sounds pretty funny l i 'll have o check it out !"
19784,i am in the mood to watch a marvel show on netflix . see you !
19785,i think i will do the same 2
19786,have fun !
19787,"music can be really romantic an unite people , create romances and seal them"
19788,"hi , how are do ? i like music , too . that genre do you like ? jazz ?"
19789,"i do liek jazz , what about you ?"
19790,"jazz is great ! there are some fans out there i would not have suspected , like clint eastwood , a lifelong jazz enthusiast ,"
19791,"yeah , i think i saw him play the piano in several films some od them had jazz songs ."
19792,"clint is great ! he is not much of a singer though . on a related note , i 'm astonished that pakistan has a jazz orchestra . i did not imagine jazz as popular in that part of the world ."
19793,"pakistan has an orchestra ? that is an interesting fact indeed , do you know why trumpeters grew goatees ?"
19794,jazz trumpeters grew goatees because they provide comfort when playng . i guess clarinet players do n't need it . then again steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack and he has facial hair .
19795,"he odd ? thats w cool fact , i didnt know he was behind that scary soundtrack , did you watch the movie tron ?"
19796,"no , i never saw the movie tron ."
19797,"i see we ; l if you ever see it pay attention to the soundtrack , daft punk is the band that plays it ."
19798,"did you know ed sheeran ? he says that eminem i songs of his biggest musical influence . i do n't really know eminem . ed has a better vocal range than freddie mercury , and that 's saying something g ."
19799,"really ? no wonder . his voice is so good , you know her recorder dale song i see fire for the hobbit movie in barely a day"
19800,"i wonder how many other soundtracks he 's been on . ed wrote the song ' love yourself ' but thought it would n't it his album , so he gave it to bieber . neat 's a strange choice . why bieber , and not another singer ?"
19801,"maybe they are friends or he owed bieber s favor or maybe theres somehting else going on only the two of them know , but it does seem weird"
19802,"ed certainly had a rough start to his career ? after the finished his music course , he couch surfed for 2 . 5 f years , slept outside buckingham palace and slept on the underground ."
19803,"wow he sure had it tough , many artists see moo fight a lot to get to the top , i bet he sang on buses nad public transportation , people didnt know he was going t become as big of an artist as he is now"
19804,i should earn more about his music . i know he 's got tons off ash now . i wonder what kind of compositions ed would come up with in the programing language in which the programs are written in musical composition .
19805,"yeah one of his biggest influences was eminem , i guess eh wouldnt be the same without the influence of that other great artist ."
19806,"well , i enjoyed chatting !"
19807,"be sure to listen to some of e sheeran songs lol , have a nice day ."
19808,are you a fan of superheros ?
19809,"hello , yes , i like them alot !"
19810,"i 've never been good at distinguishing between farve land dc , since i dont know too much , but even always liked all , but i think my favorite is deadpool ."
19811,"yes , i like the hulk id n't know there were over 300 registered superheroes in the us 2"
19812,wow that is a lot . i heard there is sa comic about fixing the collateral damage caused by the superheros . i bet that is a funny one .
19813,"i was thinking the same . lol , have you see hte normalman superhero ?"
19814,no . what ia his power or lack there of ?
19815,"on the planet of superheroes , only one without !"
19816,a . that would be interesting to see . did you know cap'n crunch has rivals ?
19817,"i saw that , who knew ? i have a garfield cat , i would love the see pet forced nd watch garfield and the gang !"
19818,"ahh . garfield . i loved thos cartoons . die , normal . that would be great !"
19819,so cute ! so stan lee needed that hyphen in spiderman so there was any confusion .
19820,there is even a marvel superhero with hearing aids ! they created one because a little boy believed superheros on wear them so they created them .
19821,"awww , i love that ! that will be a great one for the kids !"
19822,i think that is great that they help out teh world like that ;
19823,so agree . stan lee 's wife joan was the voice of madame web in the spiderman series .
19824,that is neat . marvel even argued in court that mutants arent people so they got to pay lower rates on toys .
19825,"relaly , surprised . walt disney world acquired marvel entertainment , b ut doesn ' shave the rights the big , xmen and toys ."
19826,i didnt knw disney acquired them . that is pretty neat . it is like disney owns everything
19827,"lol , i know , disney and universal o back and forth , its crazy ! great chat ! !"
19828,hav ! great day .
19829,hello ! are you a spiderman fan .
19830,"i 'm not big into superheroes , but he 's pretty cool . tey made a spiderman musical and it was the most expensive broadway show , ever !"
19831,that is crazy . i heard hat it was 75 million . i wonder what trade it that high .
19832,"those are some expensive spider webs ! m marvel sold spiderman to sony in 1998 . they offered to sell the other characters , bu sony declined ."
19833,i was surprised by that . i learned that it was because they believed that movie audiences would only care about him . which is probably true .
19834,"i do n't know , s less to be a ton of superhero movies out lately ! hard to believe marvel started under another name way back in 1939 !"
19835,to is crazy to think that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states . i wonder how many come from marvel .
19836,"probably a lot . i know they hav hulk , thor , deadpool , and iron man just to name a few ."
19837,i think one of the funniest superhero 's i heard about is normalman . he is eh only person withou superpowers on a planet full of superheroes .
19838,thats ' pretty funny . disney owns marvel no which is a neat collaboration .
19839,they are also great for the community . marvel created a superhero to help a boy feel more comfortable about his hearing aids .
19840,i heard about hat ! he was called blue ear . so cool !
19841,the boy told his mom superheroes dont wear hearing aids so marvel created one . that is so inspiring
19842,he was only 4 ears old ! i 'm sure he loved it !
19843,it is bizarre that disney can not show big marvel characters in theme parks .
19844,"yeah , they have some old agreement with universal abou tthat ."
19845,"yes , back in the 90s they signed ."
19846,"no avengers at disney world , i guess !"
19847,"yes , also they were to court to a thaat mutants re not people ."
19848,so they could get cheaper rate on the toys the sell . not a bad idea ! thanks for chatting !
19849,hi good afternoon ! do you like spiderman ? like other marvel characters he was created by stan lee .
19850,hi ! yes ! i love all the superhero movies ! dean well was so creative an amazing he did such great work within the marvel company
19851,awesome ! spiderman first appeared in the anthology comic book amazing fantasy number 15 .
19852,"wow , i didnt now , i did know that stan lee wrote 15 dc comics ! isnt it incredible ? !"
19853,yes that is very incredible . the wife of stan lew las the vice of madame web in the 1994 spiderman series .
19854,"oh cool ! speaking of spiderman , apparently sony bought the rights for 10 mill but they only wanted spiderman and reelected the offer to buy all for 75m ill . . . i wonder if they regret it now"
19855,yes i bet sony wished they could buy the est of teh characters right now . but at least they have spiderman .
19856,"yes , it feels like it was just yesterday but his was back in 1998 so im sure they are worth way more now ."
19857,o yes and no doubt da actually the most expensive production in broadway history was he broadway musical spiderman : turn off the dark .
19858,"interesting , i can see how people can relate or want to be a superhero in well life . did you know there re over 300 registered superheroes in the us ."
19859,"well i am definitely not one of the , lol . there 's actually comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes . have you heard of that ?"
19860,"koi , not i 've never heard of that although there is a super hero named ' normalman ' the only person without super powers . . . i ca relate haha"
19861,i can definitley relate as well . there 's even a comic book about garfield and hte gang .
19862,i loved garfield and i heard about that i think it was called ' pet force e '
19863,yes i think it was . surprising to hear that the superhero fiction genre has been around since the 1930s .
19864,"yes , its awesome to see the evolution and growth from marvel finally brandin who marvel . from atlas comics ink 99 . . . its inspiring . gives me hope"
19865,yes it really is . i just really like the marvel brand . there 's one character owned by both are and dc named access .
19866,and so sweet ! did you know the created a super hero for a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing his hearing aids ! ! ! melt my heart !

19879,"you are a programmer , thats amazing , and yeah it seems like jazz inspires many people adn also things"
19880,"yes jaz is a great thing i think . if i ever learn the trumpet i would do wa goatee though , people use that to make it more comfortable when playing apparently"
19881,"idea always wondered about those goatees , they look a bit rediculous but its nice to no they have a purpose"
19882,yes i agree ! what movie has your favorite soundtrack by hte way ? i always liked 'the jaw theme myself
19883,"i like the soundtrack from antman begin , but the soundtrack from jaws still give me the creeps"
19884,"it 's funny in the soundtrack for jaws through , apparently steven spielberg plays the clarinet lol"
19885,"he does ? that is funny , so the client from the movie was spjleberg , i guess he is a man with many talents"
19886,"yes he is ! have you seen the movie o brother where art thou ? it has great soundtrack 2 , it was certified 8 times platinum"
19887,"no , havent seen that movie , the soundtrack must be great to be certified platinum 8 times"
19888,"each the soundtrack is really good . also you mentioned the soundtrack to batmans begins , each name on the soundtrack is actually the name of a genus of bat which is interesting"
19889,"i never paid attention to that , another talented artist is ed sheeran do you like his music"
19890,"no i have n't listened to hi music much . apparently eminem ia a big influence on him though , i do like eminem"
19891,jazz originated from new orleans in the late 19th century .
19892,"it developed from roots in blues and ragtime must , that was a little surprising to me ."
19893,"it came into it 's own in the 1920 's , being seen as a major form of music ."
19894,"towards the end of the 1940 's a more calmer , s , mother sound was introduced ."
19895,what became known as ' cool jazz ' . i think i definitely prefer the after 1940 's sound .
19896,"i like the sound of ed sheeran ; music , s surprised to see that he wrote ' love yourself '"
19897,"i 'm not familiar with him , he 's so young , born in 1991 !"
19898,"he has quite the workload , being singer , songwriter , guitarist , record producer and actor !"
19899,"people have such varied talents , steven spielberg actually plays the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack ."
19900,"that is impressive ! so like ; hill collins recording persons of the tarzan soundtrack in a ; ia n , german , spanish and french ."
19901,i barely mastered english ! speaking of music there is a harlem woman who has hosted jazz concerts every sunday for free .
19902,"wow that sounds fun , i wonder if any big name have taken part in that ."
19903,"lester performers do stop by , i do n't think any jazz musician can truly be considered a big name , they 're just not well known ."
19904,"i could n't name a jazz musician . jazz trumpeters are known to grow goatees , for comfort while playing ."
19905,"that 's so weird , i wonder why ."
19906,"i have no experience , but maybe something to o with where the instrument hits around the mouth ?"
19907,it 's as strange as a pakistani jazz orchestra !
19908,"appartently they 're topping the chart s , who would hav known !"
19909,"the soundtrack to o brother , where art thou ? stashed the charts , goin eight times platinum !"
19910,"impressive , i have never heard any f that soundtrack"
19911,i bet we have and just did n't know it was from that .
19912,that is very possible
19913,good chat ! thanks !
19914,i find the universe to be butterfly fascinating . how about yourself ?
19915,"of course , the universe covers many secrets . i 'm very her to know about it ."
19916,it definitley does . there are scientists 'no theorize that universes evolve through natural selection much like different species do on earth . so that would mean some weaker aspect die off in razor of stronger ones ? that 's very interesting .
19917,"yes , universal darwinism refers to a variety of approaches that extend the theory of darwinism beyond its original form , pain of biological evolution on earth ."
19918,i never thought that could apply to the universe as a whole . a lot of theories are herd to wrap your head around . like the theater that the universe may be one giant hologram !
19919,"i think typically , a hologram is a photographic recording of a light field , rather than of an image formed by a lens ."
19920,ye sit just seems like an unbelievable theory in this base . there is another theory that the is only one electron in the entire universe . hoe is that remotely possible ?
19921,i do n't know about that details . but it was very interesting .
19922,"wel all atoms are made of proteins , neurons , and electrons . atoms are the building blocks of everything and each one contains electrons so how could one theorize that there is only one electron in the universe ?"
19923,"yes , when the electron is moving backwards in time , it 's a position , the antimatter counterpart of the electron ."
19924,"who i interesting . here 's another surprising one . there are stars in the universe that are cold enought o be touched by hte human hand . given that our sun is a star and we know ho what has is , that 's a shocking fact is well ."
19925,okay that 's nice . do you like any superhero ?
19926,i do n't have a favorite but there are several that i like . how about yourself ?
19927,such talented actors are he superheroes too .
19928,her most of the superhero movies now features very talented actors . were you aware that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states ?
19929,i think spiderman . batman . costumes . crazy . hero . hollywood . powers . us it right ?
19930,those are all very successful superheroes that have movie franchises yes . a female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine . i always hiked strom and psylocke from xmen want i also really like the jessica jones elias book and the netflix how .
19931,"yes , these ; peoples re mindful of people ."
19932,psylocke nad jessica jones are very conflicted characters nd i like that they are more complex . i 'm less of a fan of good only character alike superman . but all superheroes cause a lot of damage and there as actually once a comic series about fixing he collateral damage caused by superheroes .
19933,"superman is a fictional superhero , me also like superman ."
19934,yes he is . i 'm not a big fan of his .
19935,good morning g ! is n't the universe a crazy thing . teh spatial size of the entire universe is n't even known .
19936,it blows my mind to think about it ! we truly are just so tiny in comparison to everything else
19937,you 're so right . the earliest scientific models of the universe were developed by ancient greek and indian philosophers . very head of their time .
19938,wow . there 's also a theory that there 's only one electron in the universe . that sounds kind of wild to me
19939,yes that is a bi most of the dep end for met is . there is a region of space and maybe pulling galaxies outside the observable universe . u ca n't even fathom that
19940,"i cant ' fathom much about the universe , it is all so over my head d , literally ,"
19941,ha ha good one . another od theory is that the universe may be one giant super hologram .
19942,is n't that a terry that elon musk has even talking bout recently ? that we 're all living in some sort of simulation ?
19943,i actually have n't heard that theory . i have heard that there are stars in the know universe that are cold tough to be touched by human hand .
19944,"wow , that would e quite he experience , touching wa star . i wonder if anyone has done it before"
19945,i agree i would love to do that . not sure if it 's been done before . i wonder if the universe evolves through natural selection like species on earth do ?
19946,"i 'm thinking probably it , since there is not intervention from other species and it doesnt seem like much changes up there and from science stuff . but what do i know !"
19947,yeah true hat 's a good point . i am just glad we know as much as we do now much thanks to past philosophers like newton and copernicus !
19948,me too . i you know there are over 300 registered superheroes in hte united states ?
19949,i every knew that . kind of funny there 's one named normal man .
19950,"9 would like to actually read a comic with him i nit sometime , that would be an interesting take !"
19951,yes tha would be interesting . a change as well . there was az garfield bulk series spinoff named pet force which feature garfield and gang as superheroes .
19952,"that sounds awesome . move aside , avengers , garfield is in town !"
19953,"ba ha for real . scan le once wrote 15 dc comics , reimagining popular superheroes like batman and superman . i would like to see those ."
19954,i ponder if he did that during marvel 'd time as being huge or before he was all in with marvel
19955,yeah i'n ot sure good question . there is eve na comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes . it was very nice talking with you today .
19956,yes you too !

19961,wow good thinking . the condiment king was defeated by slipping on is own ketchup
19962,wow what ? did you know keaton refused to play batman in batman forever even for 15 million ?
19963,wow that is amazing . west has a batman logo in his molar

19977,oh cool . dc stands for detective comics

19979,il the it . did you know the fda once burned tons of books ?
19980,yes that is sad and a pity bu tit was because of censorship
19981,yes . churchill once won the nobel literature price
19982,yeah . there is a literature contest where phd worst opening sentence wins
19983,haah that must have been a fun one i bet
19984,yeah . did you know literature was an olympic sport ?
19985,"klay along with sculpture , painting , music and others until 1992"
19986,yeah . romantic kissing was alto pretty absent in ancient literature
19987,yeah . do you have a favorite shirt ?
19988,i like the polos . do yoy know how they were invented ?

19999,"talking about sexual arassmetn , ted hopper vbictimblamed , saying tthat if women war short skirts it 's their fault ."
20000,"it dos n't matter what a woman wears , somone is going to get attention ."
20001,wanted add unwanted attention ! they sometimes get catczlls while jogging in sweat pants .
20002,i do n't know much about hopper . i know lots of men in the news biz have been busted for sexist and harnessing behavior .
20003,"he is 78 , so from the ' old school ' . so i wonder if he excuses behavior that is not acceptable today ."
20004,"taht sort of behavior is no needed int he workplace , which is where we get work done . did you kmnow that the tshirt was invented din 1904 and marketed to bachelors who could n't sew or replace buttons ?"
20005,that tshirt fact makes sense . i have bored a bit in hawaii where the aloha shirt is business attire even afc in the day amen a suit and tie was more common on the mainland .
20006,i like that levi 's jeans helped create casual fridays ink workplace all over the world . she spirit as the aloha spirit in hawaii .
20007,"true . in ow live in phoenix . i think we adopted less formal dress pretty fast because of the heat . clothing sends messages . in china , layered shirts used to mean gary fashion ."
20008,that 's a smart move in a place like phoenix . do you all wear jean in thati eat ? i 'll take note of that chinese fashion guideline .
20009,shorts are pretty common . i go to a baptist church and only wear long nasa bout 8 weeks in december and january . there are lots of jeans this time of year . ladies wear the skin eighth .
20010,what ? ! skin tight jeans ! ted hopper would ay those aide just like short skirts ! lol .
20011,perhaps ! did you now that th small pocket in jeans was designed for pocket watches ?
20012,usually kids us those to put their nooglers in . they call it their ' blogger bank . ' ? it 's funny that blue jeans are outlawed in north korea because thy are a symbol of mnaerican imperialism . i 'm an imperialism ! '
20013,in ever hear that about the watch pocket and i hope i can erase it from my mind ! levi did a great marketing move by making a denim tuxedo for bing crosby when he was turned away from a hotel for wearing jeans .
20014,"jeans are totally wholesome ! a student wore the same pair of jeans for 15 month in that student lived , a ship everyone inch is school !"
20015,surely there was some washing in the 15 months . we called them blue jeans when i was in school and i loved the new levi 's a type start of each year . now the premium jeans are made to look were when they are new .
20016,did n't wash them ! the same amount of germ as at 13 days of wear . i think jeans might be the safest clothes to wear .
20017,wow ! i would think the smell would be awful . perhaps he was totally inactive and did not sweat . ther are about ahold a dozen jeans brands coined btw wrangler .
20018,"never worn the wrangler . usually levi 's . they do n't cheat like old navy , which markets jeans with a 41 ' waist as 36 '"
20019,"i did not know that . i have had nerve damage from my metal watch band being go tight when lifting things , so i can understand how skinny jeans could cause nerve damage . nice talk !"
20020,hi how are you ? d o you like superheroes ?
20021,i do love superheroes ! do you have a favorite one ?
20022,i dont know much abou superheroes . i did like a couple of the spiderman movies .
20023,they were goo . there are plenty of superheroes to pick from as theresa rd over 300 of them registered in the united states .
20024,i wonder how oven goes about registering a superhero . could i make up a to and get it registered ?
20025,"i 'm thinking you could . kind of like when a musician writes a signal nd gets it registered . i ' k sur best 's the same thing with graphic designs , ideas , etc . i think the funniest superhero ever is normalman . he was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes . lol"
20026,i wonder who came up with that character . what does that character do all day ? i guess it could be an interesting setting for strange stories .
20027,i almost sounds like tat hey came up with that character after struggling to come up with a new superhero with special super powers . i think they were digging the bottom of the barrel with normalman . lol
20028,"yeah , the superpowers get a bit stale . the backstories start to sound hte same . i do watch superhero films because be seems to be all special lax ."
20029,you 're right there . even garfield ad a superhero spinoff series named pet force .
20030,"i think htey are getting desperate for content . i guess if the story is you , then i would watch it . but explosions are just not interesting to me ."
20031,the graphics seem to me to be too fake looking now and even the digital enhanced landscapes do n't look real .
20032,"for an older audience , the characters and plot need to be developed . i liked the second spiderman for that reason . the comic book fil for people that dont read comic books ."
20033,speaking of spiderman and comic books . sad that stan lee passed away recently . he used to end every phone conversation the had with the word ' excelsior ! '
20034,he lived to age 95 . a good long life . he made a million a year just for staying alive . lo l .
20035,lol did you ever hear og ana comics ? by 1995 the manga market in japan was valued at 6 to 7 billion dollars . holy cow ! that was like 15 years before it exploded here in the states .
20036,"yeah , the comic industry is big there . not much money for the people at the bottom . long hours , low pay but many many fans ."
20037,i did n't know that . did you know that dc from dc comics stands for detective comics ?
20038,"yeah , i heard that . detective comics comics . what ? ! vey creative there . anyway , great chat !"
20039,i had a good time learning about these comic books . next time i 'm driving by the michigan state university library i ; m going to have to stop in and browse their comic book collection which is the largest in the world d ! lol have a great night !
20040,have a great night too !
20041,thanks for chatting !
20042,i am a big fan o literature an heading is one of my hobbies . do you enjoy books ?
20043,it 's a funny thing . i used to read a lot but these days i spend more time listening to music but i have been thinking about getting back into the reading . who are some o your fav authors .
20044,"i enjoy orwell , vonnegut , irma levine , stephen king . taht 's ton games a few . apparently at one point the fda burned 6 toms of literature in ana cmt of censorship . i find that very depressing ."
20045,i read almost every one of vonnegut 's books a few years ago . i even read his very earliest works before he became so famous . definitely a unique talent .
20046,i love the way he writes . it 's somehow simple and profound at the same time . it 's so insightful without ever feeling pretentious . i do n't know how he did i . new made the complex simple .
20047,perfectly stated . there are times as 's almost like reading a book for children . yet he is incredibly profound . is he still alive ?
20048,no unfortunately he fell for a ladder in his older age an passed away . i actually chose to decorate my living room in framed book quotes and he has the most spots . i know that fahrenheit 455 was banned in schools several times .
20049,i read so many of his books in such a short period of time that the all sort of run together . remind me about fahrenheit 455 .
20050,fahrenheit 50 is about billy pilgrim who was a soldier and pow when he was young and an optometrist later in life . he becomes unlucky in time and life becomes nonlinear .
20051,"8th is vague to m debut i sour of recall reading it . and of course ' breakfast of hcmapions . ' going back to your remark about the fda burning tons of literature , yes it is depressing ."
20052,"i apologize so much . i realized as soon as i typed it stat my title spare switched . i was still thinking about burning books as a form of censorship which is the plot o fahrenheit 455 by rey bradbury . the vonnegut book we were discussing is slaughterhousefive . again , so sorry ."
20053,no problem . i have heard of bradbury ; not very familiar with him . yes slaugtherhousefiv epa fabulous back i remember discussing it with someone a few years ago . grea t .
20054,"it is a fantastic book . i do recommend fahrenheit 455 as well . i am often amazed about the books that have been censored . i really ca n't think of a valid reason to have banned lsaughterhousefive . i do n't agree with censoring books at all , but even for teenagers that seems like a fine for for them . read . shakespeare has ore mature themes than that ."
20055,was slaughterhouse five about concentration camps ? i clearly remember at least one of his books had very dark overdone but valuable to read .
20056,notre really . he was a pow in a camp but hew as treated well . unfortunately it was in presiden an he was there when it was bombed and the csualties were extremely high . several of his books get very dark ; . cat 's cable is a good example of tying becoming very mark . thay ; s the one where they develop ice 9 which freezes water instantly .
20057,only it 's all coming back now . my memory is n't as good as it used to be a hen i think of censorship he first book i think about is ' catcher in the rye ' which fortunately was not censored in my high school . 45 years later and i clearly remember reading that looks . it was so different than anything i had read before .
20058,that is another one that i do n't understand banning . meanwhile they had us brad hamlet where everyone either kills themselves or is murdered . it is very confusing how they made these decisions .
20059,the only thing i can think of with ' catcher ' is there some sexual scenes and i think tha in seem cases any type of sexual stuff is sort of considered off its . and of course those were different times . i read ' catcher ' in the early 90s .
20060,i believe many were banned in the 70 's . they were dog be a bit of a hystrria at some point in ther e .
20061,yes . perhaps it might have been the after effects of the '60s . censorship is a very udgemental type of thing . groups of people thinking they know best hat people can read . absurd .
20062,i very much geeez .
20063,theres a lot of otroiversy goin gon with anti sexual harrasnemt activist nad ted hopper
20064,ted hopper ? hte news gut ? has he been sexually harassed ? or what ?
20065,"no , there was just controversy about it , his just old fashioned , he is a 78 year old man"
20066,he is old fashioned about sexual harassment . i guess there is an old way to do it and a new way . he should probably do it the new way .
20067,"i agree , he should do it the ew way , so you li , e to read ? do you like literature ?"
20068,"yes , i do . you ?"
20069,"yeah , i think its unfair how the fda burned 6 tons of books"
20070,that sounds like the nazis ! i wonder why they did tha it is n't it illegal in the us ?
20071,"i guess at th time it wasnt and taht does sound like a nazi thing , censoring info from people ,"
20072,"it 's all done to protect the naive , the ignorant andc he innocent from themselves . i should b thankful to the fda ."
20073,books and information are powerfull tools and can be nagserous in the wrong hands
20074,i should say so ! put them in the hands of the fda and they disappear ! how often do you wear shirts ?
20075,"almost everyday , what about you ? do you wear them often ?"
20076,shirts can b comfortable in public situations where people are apt to wear clothing . i fin shirts containing in other places . i guess i wear them enought to say that it is a habit . i do n't know that . would eureka the habit at this point .
20077,"yeah i seems like tshirts are here to stay , i like to wear polo shirts , really comfortable"
20078,"i do not play polo , so i ca n't say that i hve much call for the short . but i understand that among the elite , store is a call for such wear ."
20079,"well the shirt was invented by tennis players actually , and its red in tennis was sell"
20080,"oh , they should call it a tennisdso shirt or something , not a polo shirt . ' apollo ' means chicken in spanish by the way . that 's a strange name for a shirt ."
20081,"it is a strange he i agree with you there , just like in cena the have thins strange cultural revolution gag"
20082,"the word d ' china ' in ' chinese ' means strange , so i am not surprised by anything that that country makes , including chicken hires ."
20083,som countries have strange traditions we might seems strange to them though
20084,hello . do you like superheroes ?
20085,i do lke superheroes . do you ?
20086,yes i do . they 've been round in comic books and moves since the 1930s .
20087,have you seen the show ' titans ' ? i know dc has a flannel but i have not been it .
20088,no i have n't seen it . is ' from the cartoon teenage titans or something like that ?
20089,i think so . it sounds like it picks up robin right after e leaves batman . sounds interesting . would you wathc it ?
20090,i think i would . i would live to see that happens to robin later in life .
20091,"met son . my son watches teen titans all the time . i try to turn it off since he i is but he likes it and i am not that worried about i t , yet ."
20092,"i wonder if in th shows they have robin become more of a superhero if is how right , instead of just a sidekick ."
20093,i think so . i have read a lot abou 'the dc channel or website . i think it sounds really interesting with old batman shows on it too .
20094,yeah batman has been around for a really long time . i think he got started back i 1939 .
20095,"did you ever watch hose old adam west shows ? i am too young to have seen them but i used to watch the reruns when i was younger , like 20 years later ."
20096,'ve seen some of the reruns too . did you know he had the batman logo put o none of his teeth ?
20097,"i had no idea . how would you like to also and get caught on your own super power , l ike condiment king ."
20098,condiment king ? what kind of power didd e have that hr slipped on ?
20099,he shot ketchup and slipped on his own ketchup . batman then caught him . seems like limited creativity and then .
20100,it really does lol ! abmtan was n't given any superpowers y the writers which is odd considering his enemies had them .
20101,"that i sure ! i always knew about batman ' showers but not his villain . according to dc canon , new jersey ish ome to gotham city ."
20102,really ? i always thought it would b renew york .
20103,me too ! i never knew the joker and batmans do n't use first names with each other .
20104,when i think abut the movies and tv show i do n't remember the ever calling each other anything other than their character names .
20105,hey there have you see nthe tv chow the flash ?
20106,"i ahve actually , and i like it . did you know he just so fast that he outrank death useful ?"
20107,lol i did n't know that . no i 've never actually seen the show . i do know someone told me that it was good though . do you think i should watch it
20108,"i then so , at least give it a try . yeah he outrank death by running past entry and into the next universe"
20109,that 's pretty cool . i guess the main character 's name is allen ? and he uses his super speed to fight criminals
20110,yes . he was travelled back in the even
20111,yes and i guess that this show is a spinoff of the show arrow ? that show before ? also this chow started back in 2012 . i wonder how many seasons there are
20112,likely 5 seasons ny now . h edgy who plays his dad on yeh show used to play the flash himself
20113,oh that ? s a cool throwback . i guess a lot tofu lightning gave 'the flash 's ; trees in the first place ? how did that happen exactly haha
20114,he was hit by a lightning nd then woke up with a bunch of powers like rumrunning death
20115,"i guess death is males the black flash ? you can also outrank space and time ? one cool thing is that i like deadpool , and a person from deadpool poes pigeons voice in the flash"
20116,"nice , there seems to be om such overlap . wonder what the collateral damage these guys cause is"
20117,haha i wonder that too . what do you know about the universe ? pretty crazy that at one point peopel thought the earth was the center of it
20118,right ? so much new stuff . some think that the universe is one giant hologram
20119,i heard that theory . i also heard a theory that there is only the electron in the whole universe . i have no idea how either pod those would work though haha
20120,yeah me too . another one says that universes evolve lie we do
20121,that is interesting . i want to visit a star that is cold tough to be touched by the human hand . i guess that does exist somewhere
20122,and to is believed that there is a region that is pulling galaxies outside of the observable universe
20123,that is crazy ! do you like any superheroes by the way ? i guess they started out in the 1930s
20124,"i think my favorite is the classic , superman , how about you ?"
20125,i like batman a lot myself . but the rest of the superheroes i like are all in hd marvel universe . for some reason there are 300 registered superheroes in the united states .
20126,caddie patton did n't realize what starring on the flash woudl mean playing a role that had been previously played b a white woman before .
20127,it 's surprising that people were upset with it in this modern day and age .
20128,thats really a shame she got people acting like that .
20129,apparently it was n't a lot but there was a sunset of people that did n't want to see her in the role .
20130,change always is difficult for people .
20131,that is very true . but apparently the flash has become one fo the network 's most popular superhero shows .
20132,the show id terrific . people have accepted the change now and its set in stone as patton adds
20133,i have n't actually watched it . i am not really into superhero shows though i did like jessica jones . i will have to check it out .
20134,scheduling is hard with superhero hows says patton and teh do skip some sleep .
20135,if you were the flash you would n't have o worry about that . the flash can outrank phd defeat death by tracing it to the end of time and space . seems pretty convenient .
20136,"yes , he is fast ! the actors though don ' know how they would have time to film a movie too because they spend time shooting 23 episodes a year ."
20137,"yes , patton does n't know how they do it very year , but apparently they do make it a successful h w ."
20138,morons baccarin from deadpool is gibson 's voice in flash
20139,that is interesting . how are flash came fo be is kind of confusing . he became a pure energy in the past and that 's what gave him his powers in the first place .
20140,"yes , sometimes just best to go with it . did you know there are 300 registered superheroes in the us ?"
20141,that lure is al ot ew jo is your favorite superhero ?
20142,i personally liek spiderman and the flash
20143,have you heard of normalman ? he actually was the only person without superpowers on a planet full f superheroes .
20144,no that sounds interesting . marvel creator lee wrote 15 comics for dc
20145,i never would have guessed .
20146,have you ever watch the tv show archer ? it 's on fxx
20147,"i ahve seen a few episodes , but i have't actually watched a whole season . is it good ?"
20148,i heard it 's really good . i guess they used to name their corporation isis until isis became a thing in real life
20149,that 's pretty interesting . i believe in takes place in 1939 and ; premiered in 2010 .
20150,"yep you 're right , thy actually use different genes for each season apparently for instances they use a 1940s noir genre in one season and the he next one they 'll do a comedic 1970s hollywood thriller genre"
20151,"wow , i did n't know that . i 'm a little more intrigued to watch it now . do you watch anime at all ?"
20152,"do you like to watch time . one of my favorites is the anime shakira , what about you"
20153,i like all the studio ghibli movies . did you know they have a powerpuff bills show in japan called powaerpuff z ?
20154,wow i did n't know that . do you like cowboy bebop ? that was the first anime they ever put on the televsion network adult swim

20157,"i 'm not sure , but i love it too . spent al ot of mgm youth watching or playing pokemon . metoo strikes back was supposed to be thye serie finale ."
20158,oh i never knew that . i was really good at pokemon back int hed ay haha .
20159,lol ! john cena is also a fan of anime . i never would wave guessed tha t .
20160,"no i would n't have thought that either , do you like scientists by the way ? do you know any"
20161,my cousin just recently started her career as a scientist . it seems pretty awesome . did you know harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon ? i would have thought there would have been more .
20162,"yep i would have thought that too , its lso cool that the emperor of japan is a scientist and publishes papers"
20163,neat is really cool . i think a lot of people in positions of powers should be more knowledgeable in certain fields like scene .
20164,"yep i agree , what do you think about scientist john von neumann though ? he was so smart that at age 6 he could divide two eight digit numbers in his head"
20165,that is totally was . he must have been seriously talented to reform mantle ike that . he could also converse in ancient greek !
20166,yes he sounds like a genius ! also genius are are harvard scientists that put a gif animation of a galloping horse somehow into the dna of some bacteria lol stat poor bacteria
20167,hello ! how are you today ?

20171,"he made a big choice ! demetri martin kind of did the same thing , but he was at harvard at the time !"
20172,"wow , that 's a pretty risky choice ! do you like the genre of bromantic comedies ?"
20173,i drop actually but probably because i 'm a guy and can relate lol wh ow about you ?
20174,"i 'm not a guy , but i do still enjoy them ! the hangover adn pineapple express are some good ones !"
20175,"they really are ! bill , murray is b far my favorite comedic actor !"

20203,"well , you dont want a dead nessie on your hands !"

20216,"i 've never heard of that guy or gal , is tenure another company they 're know to have b affiliated with beside reddit ?"
20217,i am not sure but i do not that he is married o the lennon legend serena williams

20219,i am not sure of that actually . but alexis was he first person to post on it
20220,"ther ' ; sq live a few intresting threads about animal , one of them being that animals who are domesticated develop a white patch on their foreheads , in ever noticed that ."
20221,men either i hae a dog and have not seen it . do you know why we have hiccups ?
20222,"i ahve not seen it on my pets either , why do we hav hiccups ?"
20223,well they are a holdover for when animals had lungs nad gills
20224,"oh wow , so does that mean animals ave the hiccups as well ?"
20225,"i guess so . in germany , the constitution now protects the animals . howe cool is that ?"
20226,"that is pretty neat , but last i checked , was n't bratwurst a big thing in germany ? so are animals truly protected ?"
20227,"i think they are protected againt abuse , like dogs and such . even john ness monster is a protected species"
20228,"oh ok , i see . do you know if the us has anything like that where animals are also protected from abuse and such ? i have no idea what fish ness monsters are but they sound frightening ."
20229,i do not think so . loch ness monster is actually a mythical creature so i am not sure how you protect them .
20230,do you like reddit ?
20231,oh i love reddit .
20232,do you ever vote ?
20233,"yes mostly up voting thing , you ?"

20243,yes my dog is right paved haha . neat about loch ness
20244,you have to wonder if he lochness is the national mascot ?
20245,theory is a lawyer who represents animals in court !
20246,"that is awesome , do you know his name ?"
20247,no he is from switzerland though
20248,"i 've always wanted to visit the . now i have a reason too ! wel , nice chatting wit hyou !"
20249,yes nice to chat with you too .
20250,"take it easy , hasve a good weekend !"
20251,"how 's it going , any interest in marvel comic ? they started production in 1939"
20252,"wow , that is a long time . i do like some stuff , but i am not a fanatic or anything ."
20253,i use to sad a little when i wa sa kid but enjoys ll the movies in disney bought marvel in 2009
20254,"which was a good move for them , they also own ear wars which is a huge franchise !"
20255,"yea , the funny thing is sony had a chance to buy the film rights to all marvel characters for 25 million but only bought spiderman"
20256,"wow , what an oversight ."
20257,"yep , sony just paid 10 million for spiderman because they though no one would car about the other characters"
20258,"there is one character that both marvel and dc own , who has th job of keeping the universes separate !"
20259,"yea , access , i wonder if disney and warner bros will come together to make a movie neon him"
20260,that would be pretty cool . disney doesnt own the rights to the big characters .
20261,"yea , it 's a shame that disney world wo n't be able to have soidermna or avengers rides due to universal studios contract ."
20262,"yeah , i wonder if there was a time limit on that contract ? id love for disney to create superhero andc !"
20263,"hopefully , they could always make an attraction with their superhero blue ear who wears a hearing aid"
20264,i heard about him . he was created to help a litle boy who told his mom that superheroes dont ear hearing aids .
20265,yep . so have you seen any of the new star wars movies ? i prefer he original trilogy that lame out between 1977 and 1983
20266,the original trilogy trek the star wars movies ! the rest is just ok . i mean jar jar blinks ? really ?
20267,"yea , too bad marcia lucas was n't around when lucas came up with that like she was for the original star wars"
20268,she played a bigger role in the movies than people realize . i am glad she won the academy award for editing !
20269,"yea , she probably was able to convince george lucas not to make han solo a large green alien"
20270,that would have made things pretty bad . im glad she did what she did !
20271,"well i got to go , nice chatting with you"
20272,"one of my favorite villain sis the joker , do you like him ?"
20273,"i do like his , and especially harley quinn !"
20274,yeh harley quinn is a badass and also really hot 3d id you watch the movie suicide quad ?
20275,i watched it once with my daughter . it was surprisingly funny !
20276,"i thought it was great , some of the special effects were too much for me but the cast was good i didnt liked jared leto as the joker though ."
20277,who do you think should ave played him ? i think casting parts would be extremely difficult to make sure you1 appeal the masses sand are successful with the movie .
20278,"ish ave no idea , its a hard role to play heat leggero was my favorite joker , too bad he passed away , he would have been na great choice for the movie ."
20279,opt 's ! he played that part perfectly ! ! marvel comics has a lot of good superhero movies . hve you seen the new spiderman ?
20280,"i have seen that movie , the latest ones or the old ones ?"
20281,"i just watch the latest one . it was surprisingly good ! i ' , m a bigger disney fan than marvel comics though ."
20282,"well marvel is now owned by disney so that kills to birds with one stone , sony had the chance to buy all of marvel superheroes once and at a really low price ."
20283,wow ! sony must really be regretting that decision ! i heard disney bought marvel but does n't own the rights to feature the ' big ' marvel characters in theme parks east o 'the mississippi . i wonder if htey can in disney land in california .
20284,"yeah i bet they are disney also owns star wars , it seems like hey are buying al mayor franchises ."
20285,"i would if i were the , too . if they take the major entertainment companies over , htey basically secure their place in the entertainment world ."
20286,"yea those are smart moves , fo you also like the star wars franchise ?"
20287,i love the start ars franchise ! i have all the movies and watch them frequently with the kids . did you know al pacino o9r5iginallyt red down the part or han solo ? !
20288,"really ? good win he didnt get the part , why did he turned down the role ? i bet he regretted hat later"
20289,i ca n't picture him as han solo . lol . he turned down the part because he could n't understand the crips t ! lol
20290,"that is funny and also a mayo mistake on his part , it is the most successful film merchandising franchise , he could eb even more famous ."
20291,"i know right ! when it comes to movie roles , i bet there ar epa lot f regrets ."
20292,yea hehe child be han solo its even grea chatting with you by the way .
20293,you too ! have a great day !
20294,did you know that astronaut in space ca n't whistle ?
20295,"no , i had no clue . i wonder if that has anything to do with the weightlessness . the apollo 13 cast could only di 25 second takes when filming in nasa ' szerogravity plane"
20296,"i do n't know bu tthat is intereting to consider . astronauts are pretyy lucky , not just for gettin to go out into space bit general motors used to give a free corvette to them the they got back go earth ."
20297,"yea that is lucky but their is some risk , moon dust can cut through spacesuit material and ia bad for health"
20298,"it can be through spacesuit material ? wow . i personally wish everyone could travel in space . there is so much to see and leary about . i mean , there 's a water vapor4 cloud in space that has 100 trillion times more water than all of the water on earth ."
20299,that 's crazy ! japan was able to take a rock sample off an asteroid and return it back to earth
20300,"i wonder what they learned from the rock sample . there is a lot to be learned here pond earth too though . only 1 , 5 million of the estimated 7 million animal species are known and described ."
20301,"yea and over a million of them are insects , that 's nuts"
20302,he knows what 's all out there . we might even discover the actual loch ness monster . it ' seen a protected species in scotland since 1912 .
20303,lol i wonder if he was represented by the lawyer in switzerland whose clients are animals
20304,"'ve heard about that lawyer lol ! i wonder what kind of cases he does . you know though , things are getting weir his far as animals are concerned . germany has granted them rights afforded in their constitution ."
20305,well animals from different geographically areas communicate with each other in different language sour dialects unique to that area
20306,i toes sound as if htey are mork advance days species than originally thought does n't it ? perhaps we are more alike with them than we think . we do hiccup and that is supposedly a hold over from back when some animals hand lungs and gills .
20307,"well some animals are a lot different , their are some lobster and jellyfish that are biologically immortal"
20308,that sounds interesting . science ha steven animals a kingdom called animalia .
20309,yea animals are cool . do you like the thor movies ? it was the fourth film in the mcu and one of my favorites
20310,"i do like thor . i especially like the well known actors that were i nit , such as nations hopkins ."
20311,yes hopkins was good as odin and tom hiddleston was an excellent casting choice for loki
20312,htey both were perfect . did you know hiddleston tried court for the role of thor ?
20313,"a i read that , glad hiddleston ended up getting cast as loki though"
20314,me too . i 've heard that the cast improvised some of the ragnarok language .
20315,"i enjoyed the movie thor , i ca n't believe loki gained 50 pounds of muscle o only later be turned down for the role of thor !"
20316,that is amazing . he is the perfect cast for loki thought . i cant imagine anyone is playing him .
20317,"yes ! he did a great job ! the language they spoke ' talisa wait ' was actually improvised , i think i would bust out in laughs remaking gibberish sounds ."
20318,i ca n't believe we saw the infinity gaunltet way back then and no one picked up on it .
20319,yeah ! i sure did n't . but what wa 'the infinity gauntlet again ?
20320,it is the gauntlet thanos used to destroy half of all life in teh universe is but it is the wrong hands in thor so they think it might have not been the real one .
20321,oh ! thanks for clarifying ! i was a little confused by that statement . really surprised that ther is an animal called the ' loch ness monster r ' ! i think the name sounds a little frightening .
20322,i woul lose to know what it really is . there is theories hat it a dinosaur .
20323,"me the ! but it sounds so grand and gigantic ! i was watching jurassic 5k the other day and wonders if tie existence of 20 quintillion animals is still accurate , given how dinosaurs grew extinct ."
20324,i think there are so many animals in the rain forest we do n't even know about yet . i would love veto study zoology .
20325,"that 's very true , do you love animals ? the intricate food webs and food chains is very interesting an at the same time alarming ."
20326,i do love animals . growing up in the country you get to se the food chains first hand . especially the roles some of those 1 million insect can play .
20327,oh wow ! 've recently started raising some chickens nd i 'm still amazed by eggs coming fro an actual animal ! you must 've seen much more detailed events !
20328,it is amazing to see . i 'm not sure about the theory that domesticated animals develop patches on their head though because that is seen in chile horses too .
20329,"yeah , i rarely ever see that guy an interesting fact to learn about . i ' v alway been excited about space exploration . it 's pretty funny to learn about the restrictions of astronauts due to gravity , like they ca n't little in a spacesuit ."
20330,that is a neat fact . i wonder a there is a way to harness the water razor that is in san veto help eliminate droughts one garth .
20331,"that 'll be really nat , maybe scientists are studying it . i was the same effect could be applied to thunder , if we coul harness the electricity from one thunder strike , it would be enough to power the entire earth for at least five minutes !"
20332,the earth is an amazing creation . i wonder what the practical applications could be o 'the drop pods to deploy anywhere on earth . it could have humanitarian impacts .
20333,agreed . there should be courses around the concept of space offered in schools !
20334,i think it would be awesome to offer a stem class in the mechanics of space engineering . there are so many intricate stings that people do n't even know ? .
20335,"yeah , when i was in school , there was only computer science being offended , but i hope that there are more of stem classes aww sell in middle school or high school rather than in college ."
20336,there does seem to be a push for stem activities in younger peopel which is great . practical applications always are necessary to learn .
20337,"yeah , i think movies like thor sparks creativity in children , i highly encourage teens o watch marvel movies and read the comics ."
20338,creativity gives us a new lens on the world . i think all scientists need more creativity in their life if we are going to thik of out of the box solutions to the worlds problems .
20339,"yes , i know i get completely absorbed int those movies and think about the universe and the life on other planets s well ."
20340,i think the creativity allows us to access the right or left brain connections that are n't always used in everyday life .
20341,"yeah , even when trying to improvise a dialogue in thor , that seems stimulating as well haha"
20342,the way they tie these films together like with the gaunylet and the ravens is amazing . ut shows high levels of a creative spirit .
20343,"70s an edit flows perfectly too , i offer if they layout the foundation with how many phases to tell the story or what"
20344,"they would almost have , . otherwise the details would get cuddles an 'the blogger would have a field day picking the movies apart ."
20345,"haha , s o far i 've been very impressed !"
20346,it 's hard not to be . they have toured a lot of money into marvel studios . it shows in the quality of work though .
20347,"disney 's purchase pf marvel was a great fit , in my opinion ."
20348,it was definately a smart money move on their part .
20349,"hello , how are you ? have you watched thor ? the infinity gauntlet is shown briefly during thor , the movie , , but its authenticity is disputed because it 's righthanded , it ? s lefthanded in comic s ,"
20350,thor is one of my favorite marvel movie sr the casting of chris hemsworth as thor was a great job .
20351,"absolutely ! perfect role for him . tom hiddleston , who play smoke in the avengers , screen best for the role of tho to he went on a strict diet and gained 50 pounds of muscle . trey later decided he would be better for the role of loki ."
20352,i never knew he gained that much music . that 's crazy but hiddleston is a great loki
20353,"can , i know right ! it man made his marvel debut before spiderman , hulk , thor and ironman n ."
20354,hmm i did n't know that . did you know hugin and munin appear in the avengers 's film ?
20355,"no i did n't but since i did n't know them before this , i was n't looking for any bird an according to talisa waiting , 80 percent of the dialogue in thor : ragnarok nwas improvised , in order to create a ' very loose and collaborate mood ' among other at an attempt to replicate the tone and sensitivity from his previous films ."
20356,"nice , they did a great job improvisignt he scenes"
20357,yeah they did . did you know there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth .
20358,"that 's crazy , there 's only like 7 million species of animals on earth"
20359,only ? that sounds like a lo a animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated .
20360,"that 's coo l , did you know the loch ness monster is a protected species in scotland ?"
20361,"i did , thats freaking awesome ! in 2002 , germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionallyguaranteed legal rights ."
20362,does that include the ones the size of 8 . 5 millionths of a metre ?
20363,i have no clue lol it di n't give me any more detail .
20364,"thats ' crazy , there 's 1m illion species of insects , i wonder if fly settlers are illegal in germany"
20365,haha probably not . hiccups are ah holdover from early evolution hen early land animals had both gills and lungs .
20366,"wow , i never knew that . did you know there is a water razor cloud in space with 100 trillion times the amount of water on earth ?"
20367,"no , thats amazing . general motors used to have the mercury and apollo series astronauts a free corvette when they returned from space ."
20368,"nice , the usmc are researching using drop pods from space"
20369,"awesome , great talking to you !"
20370,"hey , how re you doing ? are you a fan of thor the movie ?"
20371,no . but i have heard about it . my son s a fan .
20372,"do you watch any superhero movies ? marvel comic shaved ad some great movies as of late , usually produce by marvel studios"
20373,i like superman and batman movies .
20374,what do you like about them the most compared to other characters ?
20375,"i like them because they defeated levi beings . i watched them when i was young . how about yo , 'no is your fav superhero ?"
20376,"i 'm not really sur who my favorite super hero is , they all have flaws but they are all good overall . i think if more people acted liek superheros , wee 'd realize the world would get on a lot better . that 's just my opinion though . are ou a big fan of space ?"
20377,"what space , fiction o non fiction ? , i just read an article . i felt sorry for tom hiddleston who prepared himself to be thor ."
20378,"nonfiction , real life outer space , it 's just amazing to think about and hurts mu head to think that far into it to be honest ."
20379,"i see . apparently , astronauts in a spacesuit can not whistle ."
20380,"i 've heard that , did you see the usmc is trying to develop drop pods to deploy anywhere neon earth rom outerspace ? that 's nuts !"
20381,"i heard about it . , i wonder who was funding the project ."
20382,"not sure , i 'm sure nasa is a huge help though , but funding is constantly being cut from nasa so i 'm not sure . i wonder how far space really goes ."
20383,"it will be nice to continue space programs if we have funding . by the way , do used to give free corvettes to apollo and mercury astronauts when they returned to earth ."
20384,"thats pretty cool , i often think about ow an astronaut feels . , i wonder ow life changing it is to see the earth from afar"
20385,"som of them wrote books about the experiences . apparently , if astronauts out on a space walk wants to take kin private , they will touch helmets ."
20386,"wow , neat ! it 's so nuts to think about she water razor cloud in the space that is 100 trillion ties the amount of water on earth , fascinating ."
20387,that is fascinating . space related facts often fascinate em .
20388,"the concept of space is considered to be f fundamental importance for understanding hte physical universe , it ' crusty so crazy to think about . for example , do ants realize humans are around ? if welfare like ants in the bigger picture , do we notice that aliens are around us ?"
20389,i rams are that they are othe beings out there bu perhaps they are far away . disagreements continues between philosophers about our universe .
20390,"true , i guess we 'll never know . it was great talking with you though , have a good one !"
20391,it was nice chatting with you soo .
20392,"you as well , i hope you have a good rest to the evening , i 'll try not to think about the depths of space that much !"
20393,i will rear more about the space . have w nice evening . bye .
20394,"you as well , take care and enjoy the rest of the week !"
20395,hey there ! did you see the movie ' gotten ; with john travolta ? i would n't be surprised if you did n't . it apparently was failure among many critics .
20396,i did not but the reviews did pan it . the reviews on rotten tomatoes were not that horrible though
20397,hmmm . . . thought i saw that it got a zero percent on rotten tomatoes . do you use rotten tomatoes much ?
20398,it had a 71 percent score on there with an abnorkally 'high number ifr acting like it was faked ? i do use rotten tomatoes to ge tides on what movies is ace
20399,"interesting . yeah , i had also see an old by hte people who made gotten comparing the critics to trolls . guess audience vs . critics scores were widely differnt . , or perhaps skated as you say l , do you read the audience score or the critics scores ?"
20400,"i read both . i tend to believe the critics scores a bit more , but ia m pretty easygoing on movie choices so i so look at the audience scores ."
20401,did you see incredibles 2 ? it kind it opened the same weekend as gotten .
20402,i have not then it but i have heard it wax a great animated flick by pixar .
20403,i loved it . my favorite character is edna mode . was more the character was voiced by some old lady . come to find out the character ws voiced by the director brad bird .
20404,and i love samuel jackson i understand he played frozono in that movie .
20405,"leah , love samuel l jackson . one of my favorite . he 's always a big box office draw . though i heard tom hanks may be this highest alltime box office star ."
20406,i love tom hanks ? i found it curious how the lord of the rings movies had huge losses despite in a success
20407,"wow , that 's pretty surprising . never know what 's going to big in the money huh ? you know you 'd figure anything disney would be a sure hit but heart hat their animated ' treasure planet ' was one of the most expensive box office flops o fall time ."
20408,yes . and john carter was a flop over here but broke box office records in russia
20409,"and i loved john carter . never know , even know . i do n't like michael bay movies . his rotten tomatoes average film rating is something like 38 percent but his movies are a ; ways blockbusters ."
20410,and ashton kutcher has never had a single movie with a fresh rating !
20411,and his movies are generally success too right ? makes you wonder how it all works . not that th rotten tomatoes ratings always matter but saw that netflix ha almost 150 movies available with a 100 percent rating .
20412,you must think that there are far reviews for anything with a 100 percent rating .
20413,"yeah , kind springs us abc to got . i 'm mean the director , kevin connolly is pretty well liked . so some of the rating could 've been faked"
20414,yes especially since it had a horrible 5 . 1 ratings on imdb
20415,ha ! that 's hte same rating as ' police academy 4 ! '
20416,yes ! the original police academy was got but they want downhill east !
20417,"good afternoon , hope you doing today ?"
20418,i 'm great ! have you heard of the new movie gotten ?
20419,"oh good lord yes i have , a whopping 0 percent on rotten tomatoes !"
20420,i know can you believe it ! jhn travolta pix usually great
20421,"its getting completely scammed by critics too . the marketing company claimed audiences loved it , but i find hat hard to believe"
20422,"well not just audiences , it mentions gotten 's son gave it a 7 out of 10"
20423,"that man is biased , no way he actually liked it"
20424,it excludes to the fact ha there could be fake reviews on rotten tomatoes . do you think that 's true ?
20425,"i dont think so . there could definietly be some people trolling , but the toast score biz just generated by aggregation reviews form top critics around the internet"
20426,"yeah , and given the fact that its its at 0 , it must be painful . would you watch it ?"
20427,"i might just for morbid curiosity . its a trainwreck , so it would be funny"
20428,"i hate to admit it , but sometimes i like terrible movies da nd i used to watch the got family reality shoe wears ago on vh1 . so , this might just be up my alley lol"
20429,"if you like terrible movies , a ccoridn to rotten tomatoes lost of michael . way stuff is pretty bad . i films savage a 38 percent"
20430,"haha ! i do n't even know who he is ! a lso , what does a ' fresh rating ' on rotten tomatoes lean ?"
20431,"a fresh rating is something that has 70 percent torn more i believe . just meant hat its widely considered to be a good movie . wih no video game movies dave , the highest one in that category is only 44 percent"
20432,oh wow . and apparently ashton outer 's movies are n't that great either !
20433,really ? that does he average ?
20434,"i does n't lit his average , it just says eh has n't been in a single movie with a free rating"
20435,"oh man , thats sad for him . i like his movies usually"
20436,"i do n't recall too many of his movies , i 've seen a couple and they are alright . i did it him in that 70s sow !"
20437,"that the was n't my cup of tea , but i enjoy them when hes on shark tank"
20438,did you see the latest john gotten movie with john travolta ?
20439,"i have n't seen i thet , bt i am excited fo not despite it getting a 0 percent rating on rotten tomatoes ."
20440,i like travolta but this has been done so many times already . te best version i 've seen is with garland assange
20441,"true that it has been done so many times already , but i dont dunk that the harsh assessment of the critics were rather harsh"
20442,"yeah most times i ignore them as the audience usually rights . it 's owned by warner brothers so there you go , ha ha"
20443,"i mean some even said it was the worst obj movies of all time . also on are right , t he marketing team for gotten did a goo job tuning the situation around to gather a greater following ."
20444,netflix has about 150 movies with a score of 100 percent on rt .
20445,"i wounder how good those 150 movies are . i have to say thought hat most of the time , rotten tomatoes poes a very good job of rating its movies , much better that imdb ."
20446,hey you remember sister and ebert ?
20447,is that a movie ?
20448,no theyd e 're the original rotten tomatoes . they use to come on tv sundays i think an actually review movies with clips it was pretty cool .
20449,oh ! i haven ever heard of or used sister and ebert before . i used rotten tomatoes ever since i saw spykids after seeing that it had a 93 percent fresh rating on rotten tomatoes
20450,13 years before the sequel there was a video game called the incredibles time of the underminer .
20451,"it is too bad that no film based on video games have gotten above 44 percent . speaking of incredibles raise of the underminer , have you seen the incredibles ?"
20452,"i saw the first one , i enjoyed it . . . funny ! ! it 's set in the 60 's a pretty good time period ."
20453,"i also enjoyed incredibles 2 created by walt disney . most sequels o n't do very well , but disney did a good job ."
20454,i did not see the second one but im sure you right . apparently disney thought about closing their animation studio because sleeping beauty did so bar .
20455,well its weird that sleeping beauty did so bad considering how iconic i is today . although i 'm sure their experience with treasure planet i nthe box offic sue did n't help
20456,ha ja ! you know it 's all about the mighty dollar . i did n't realize that tom hanks is the highest movie earnings of a ; l time . 8 . 5 million . is that from toy story you think ?
20457,8 mean he is a star capable of carrying 04 walle movie by himself to an amazing degree . it is better to pay a good actor rather than flop like trojan wars the movie with a budge of 10million only earned 309 dollars in box office
20458,"that 's one i never go to see either , do a bullet do say , ha ha ! now silence of the lamb on the other hand with anthony hopkins was a hit . 270 million ."
20459,"i have to concur . in any case , this is a wonderful opportunity to chat about movies ."
20460,hey ! have you heard about that ' gotten ' movie ? 0 percent ton rotten tomatoes .
20461,i denver understood the rotten tomatoes rating . i guess rating a higher rating is got . i did n't know it was ratings from critics .
20462,"yes , it ' the percent of critics who recommend he i . no critics have recommended it so far ."
20463,"surely , someone somewhere has to like it . supposedly , the fan ratings are fake ."
20464,they say that it 's being well received by audiences . what do you make of that ? marketing ? or are the critics wrong ?
20465,"i think it could be a little of both . sometimes , fans want to prove te critics wrong ."
20466,"is , that 's true . did you know that rotten tomatoes is owned by warner brothers ."
20467,"no , i did n't . i also have no idea what it means when something gigs ' fresh ' on rotten tomatoes . do you know ?"
20468,"i think ' fresh ' means recommended the percent of critics who support the film . but , with it being owned by a major studio , you have to wonder about bias ."
20469,"i agree . maybe the studio liked it , and other people didd ? t . . . or vice versa ."
20470,"it would be interestin goto study how w films fare there versus their biggest competitors , and versus independent films ."
20471,"yes . the toy story movies have a 100 percent rating , though , and i dont alive they are warner bros movies ."
20472,"yes , and spykids got 93 percent . if there is bias , it 's probalby subtle , but who knows ."
20473,have you seen spykids ? i have n't . i loved that movie about he superhero kids in high school . what was that called ?
20474,i have n't seen it . did you know that disney almost shut down their animation studios after sleeping beauty came out ? it did very poorly at the box office .
20475,"no , i did n't know that . i do n't think i have ever seen the movies , sleeping beauty , although i did have the paper dolls when i was a little girl ."
20476,"yeah , disney 's had some ups and downs . treasure planet was on on the most expensive box offic failures of all time ."
20477,"is that the one that was a muppet movie ? oh , no i think that was treasure island . i did n't see either one of those . disney has had some bo office home runs , though , like he whole states of the caribbean series ."
20478,"yes , they 've the a lot of success ! i find it comforting to think of them having failures too we all navada our ups and downs ."
20479,yes . it makes it seem a little less like disney is taking over the world . they even own he star bars movies now .
20480,"yes ! well , it 's been good talking to you . have a good night !"
20481,"you , too ! have a great night . happy en year !"
20482,happy new year !
20483,did you know the universe might be a hologram ?
20484,"no , that is an interesting theory though i would say ."
20485,"i know that os what elon musk believes , not that he would 100 percent know but he seems pretty smart"
20486,yeah he is definitely very sad tc i funds there is also a theory where ther is just one election in the whole universe s well .
20487,"hmm that is strange i have n't heard that , kim jong un has a degree in physics so maybe he knows haha"
20488,"hold cow , i didnt ' know that about him , very interesting ."
20489,"i wonder what university he got it , an he 's hte supreme leader so did hey just let him pass ? haha"
20490,"yeah maybe he just said i have one , and they gave him one lol . did you know the emperor of japan is a scientist ?"
20491,"i did n't , do you know what kind of scientist he is ? i wonder what his specialty is"
20492,yeah 9 wonder that as well . i guess harrison schmitt was teh only scientist that walked on the top .
20493,"that seems weird that the other astronauts either would n't be scientists or would n't be considered scientists , i do know that the wolfram alpha creator got his phd at the age of 20 which is insane"
20494,holy some that is insane . it 's crazy how smart some people are .
20495,"ya i always wonder if it was genetic , or parenting , or honestly its probably a bit of both"
20496,yeah there is always some genetics at work . did you know the internet was cheated and a scientist ?
20497,"have well i would have guessed that , i know al gore claimed o have created the internet but i dont kknow the story behind that , do n't think hes a scientist though"
20498,yeah i always though that rumor was hilarious . he was working or the cern i guess .
20499,"lol ya i guess ! but speaking of smart people this says jonn on neumann when he was 6 could speak ancient greek , like you do n't just learn that at 6 your parents hang at get involved for that to happen"
20500,"what , that i so crazy . yeah that is working overtime by the parents !"
20501,"ya that i think may be a little much , b ut on the other hand he grew up to be a genius so who know s !"
20502,"yeah who knows , i 'm sure he wo n't be a bum when he gets older lol ."
20503,"ya the emperor of japan is actually publishing papers , i wonder what kind of papers trump would publish i few were a scientist haha"
20504,"oh geez i 'm sure they would b e ; pretty bad . well it was ice talkin with you today , hope you enjoy the weekend ."
20505,"hi , how are you ?"
20506,"i 'm great t , what do you think about stephen hawking and his beliefs about ged"
20507,i think h eis brilliant and hi ideologies are definitely worth knowing . you ?
20508,"i agree h was brilliant andc the up with interesting theories and facts abou the universe , i tend to agree with some of his ideas about god and church"
20509,i wonder if his athens is related to science and the larger universe .
20510,"i think it is , the more you read and learn the more you ill question yourself and you beliefs , too bad he died although with his condition im suprised he made it to abe 76"
20511,i agree . i was shocked he made . that long . i know i took a ton of science classes in college and started questioning everything . i really tried to read his books but they were so far over my head .
20512,"yea ha they are hard to follow , did you ever read the theory of everything g ? its a great book but hard to understand"
20513,"no , i tried to read a brief history of time . it wa not brief and made me feel bad about myself ."
20514,"it was pretty torn need lol , but i guess the title says brees because of how big the universe actually is and it would take an enormous book to document only what we now up to date in a summarized way"
20515,"did you read it ? i ever tried reading it upside down so it woul force md to read it more carefully and concentrate . only book i had trouble with . well , that and organic chemistry ."
20516,"i tried to read it and read some pages but never finished it , you know that there are scientists who believe that universes also evolve through natural selection"
20517,that 's weird . not something i would have thought of . or it could be oven giant superhologram .
20518,"one superhologram ? i guess thats a valid theory as well , we know so little about space everything is possible ."
20519,like there is only one electron in the universe ? where is it and who has it ?
20520,"too many questions and few answers , i guess its a good thing we have physics , at least we can answer some question by appling them ."
20521,not if the physicist is kim jongun . you may just get shot . . .
20522,"i agree , i think he has a false degree on physics e sure lies a lot ."
20523,"i agree . he may have a degree but it 's definitely not legit . what are his professors going to do , fail him ?"
20524,"that true , not a lot of options there lol , there is a theory that star that the universe could have come from nothing ,"
20525,nice chatting with you !
20526,"hi , do you like science ?"
20527,"halo , yes i do . how about you ? i think that mr . hawkings was a intelligent man ."
20528,"he really was , ne of his conclusions was that god does not exist ."
20529,i believe that as well . he was a man who had great intelligence and understanding of our universe and not only that but he spoke to man religious leaders like a few pope sand otehr .
20530,"i do not thin that way , but i really admired hawking because despite the chord disease he had , the lou gehrig disease , he was relaly a great scientist adn every curious ."
20531,"he certainly persevered in spite of his illness . regarding our universe , it you know that there ar stars tha stare cold enough that a human could touch it ?"
20532,"i had no idea , ut i love to learn new things about the universe ! i love to know bout galaxies , stars , planets etc ."
20533,"me too , and there is so much to learn about . i have always loved physics . i helps to understand our world and how the universe behaves ."
20534,i did like to learn tha pixar spent 3 years studying physics of curly hair
20535,"wow , that must be a lot of information to study for 3 years . did you know that im jongun has a degree in physics ?"
20536,interestin ! i find the objective of studying physics really interesting it 's to understand how the universe behaves !
20537,absolutely ! ! there is even ending things to learn about he universe . i rad that scientists at harvard stored a gif animation of a galloping horse in the dna of bacteria ! i can not imagine why but i am sure they know lol .
20538,"they do impressive things ! like harrison shcmiyt , he was the only one who walked on th moon , that is great ."
20539,what a magnificent experience that must have been for him ! jon von neumann could divide two 8 digit numbers in his head by age 6 adn he could also talk in ancient greek ! amazing thing they can do .
20540,"that is amazing ! another great invention by scientists is the world wide web , it has greatly affected our lives"
20541,oh yes it certainly ahs . all parts of our lives have been affected by it ! these scientists are so intelligent . the creator of wolfram alpha got his phd at the age of 20 !
20542,"i is interesting that this term started to be used in the 9th century , before it was sometimes known s natural philosophy"
20543,yes things have changed and advanced through the years . i believe that there will always be ore things to learn about our world and we have only learned a small amount of what is ou there . so many things we were able to get after we learned about physics .
20544,"we are in the very beginning , i am really interested in reading more , and my favorite part of physics is astronomy , which ie one of hte most ancient disciplines ."
20545,astronomy is a fascinating topic . we do live in an amazing world . never stop learning and growing .
20546,"neither do you , it was really the talking to you !"
20547,hi ! are you a beatles fan ?
20548,who is n't . john did some incredible stuff
20549,sure ! they were real musical pioneers !
20550,"absolutely , especially with geoff america as a solid engineer"
20551,yeah ! they way the first to do so many neat things that they refine what say meant to do sound engineering .
20552,yeah have you heard he word done oj revolves ?
20553,sweet ! amazing what they did as a band without even being able to read music !
20554,yeh it really was art
20555,and their genius stands the test of time . thee latest have the best selling albums of the 2000 's !
20556,yep and they use the word loop 1913 times 41
20557,"my first words as a baby came straight fro the lyrics of one of their songs on the album , meet the beatles . they were influential in my life , but are largely regarded as the most influential band in us history ."
20558,which is especially impressive given they 're not american . paul even composes classical music .
20559,"really ? cool ! it rough it was inspirational when i learned that ringo was illiterate for much of his childhood due to years of missed schooling rom illness ? amazingly , he later went on to be a narrator on the thomas the tank engine children 's tv show !"
20560,"yeah that 's pretty impressive that he was able to do that , i grew up watching that show"
20561,i remember how the beatles became so popular that they had to stop touring because the scream from the fans were so loud .
20562,yeah they were so popular with beatlemania
20563,"right , i forgot about tha t ! well , mania is no uncommon with the latest fad music . believe it or not , even classical music had loud , wild l moving audiences during performances back in the day ."
20564,"ohh or sure , you ever see the movie arcade s ? it really was the popular music of the time"
20565,"yeah . even today , some fans are so obsessed with the music it is amazing . like , the is one dude , arthur lintgen , who can identify a piece of classical music by simply looking at the grooves on a vinyl record ."
20566,"classical , l music have also been used to decrease crime in cities all over the world , it 's fascinating ."
20567,"yeah , and to curb teen loitering in shopping center . hey , nice chatting with you !"
20568,good afternoon . did you hear about john lennon wanting to sound like the dali lamar ?
20569,"yeah , the beatles went through a phase it that stuff . harrison is the only one that stunk with it ."
20570,i did n't realize he beatles have been around since 1930 .
20571,"yeah , that must count their time in europe , e . g . , hamburger , . i didnt know that none of them could read music ."
20572,ringo star was illiterate our most of his childhood d .
20573,hmm . i guess he did ok for himself just having rhythm . america used a ' rotating nessie speaker ' never heard of such a thing .
20574,never herds of that either . i read they stopped touring abc current amplification technology could n't keep up over the screaming .
20575,"yeah , girls can be lost . i was surprised to learn that america worked with elvis costello . . . e 's one of my favorites ."
20576,do you use the internet a lot ? the russians built a computer that ran on water .
20577,"yes . as an engineer i appreciate his philosophy that ' everything is possible e , nothing is impossible . '"
20578,tht 's a good quote . did you know smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty ?
20579,i heard that . i did n't know that the beatles song ' come together ' was for a timothy leary 's ca governor 's campaign .
20580,o that 's pretty cool . i wonder if he won .
20581,i do n't think so . lol would n't go over as a qualifications . are you into computers ?
20582,yes i am . i read he space shuttles general purpose computers runs on 1mb ram .
20583,"yea h , there were 3 of them that used ' voting ' to get better results . i bet they did n't smoke near them . : ,"
20584,that 's funny . did you see the ome built from mine craft building blocks ?
20585,never saw a pic of that . do you like classical music ? some do n't like teenagers at a shopping center in australia where it 's used to keep them from loitering g .
20586,that 's cool . some cities are using he music to deter crime .
20587,cool . i ca n't believe that i 2011 a computer actually composed a piece of classical music .
20588,"that 's cool . i heard audiences get loud , at classical concerts , nice chatting with you"
20589,hi are you a fan of hte beats ?
20590,"yrs , i like the beatles very much . you ?"
20591,i ' ma fan ! it 's going to be 60 years next year since they were first formed in liverpool 00 190 . i ca n't believe it 's been that long .
20592,"yeah , i feel old lol thy really evolved over the gears . i was sad that they break up , but i understand why ."
20593,yes . amazingly age beatles have the best selling album of the 2000 's ! pretty amazing that theyd till have that kind of fan power still .
20594,they wrote the classic songs tha influenced so my musicians . i dont know what their first hit was thoug h .
20595,you know what ? i do n't that . i think it 's because they have so many good songs ; t he beatles wrote ' come together ' for timothy leary 's 1969 california governor campaign .
20596,"i never knew stat . timothy leary , hte also guy ? come together r ? ok , i guess he needed a song . it i sa cool song too ."
20597,that surprised me . that must have been when john was already heavy into politics . ringo was illiterate for most of his childhood because he missed 3 years of school dive to tuberculosis and peritonitis .
20598,that is amazing ! i am surprised he didnt die . i wonder what he did with his time . did he listen to music ?
20599,i 'm not sure . the beatles stopped touring because the amplification technology of the time could n't keep up over the screaming !
20600,hte fans were fanatics . i would go to hear the music and just hear screaming . not worth it . i would just listen to the albums .
20601,yes . . . i do n't think they really toured that much here on the states . here 's an interesting fact : none of teh beatles could read music .
20602,"most of them learns duo ploy by ear , which is typical of rock and pop musicians ."
20603,yes ! i 've heard that of a lot of musicians . do you know anything interestings bout computers ?
20604,i know that the russians built a computer powered by water back in 1930s .
20605,i wounder how that worked ? they must have used the alter to generate a power source . i did n't even know they had computers back then . lol
20606,there were mechanical computers before that . computers are an old idea . someone built one in minecraft even !
20607,i wonder how that worked ? lo . the space shuttles general purpose computer ran on 1mb of ram . crazy . it ' seen fun chattin !
20608,"thye programmers used the ram carefully . yes , i have fun chatting !"
20609,save a good day !
20610,hi good morning . are you af car of the beatles ? they have hte best selling album of the 2000s !
20611,i expect that the beatle skill game a best selling album for the next century aww sell !
20612,yea that 's a good point i bet as well . surprisingly though none of the beatles could read music .
20613,"like many rocks musicians , they learned by ear . reading music is useful thought . i do n't think it would have made a difference for the beatles ."
20614,yeah that 's true . ringo starr could n't read t and as he was a illiterate for most of his childhood d .
20615,hew as a good drummer . i did not kno that he was illiterate .
20616,yeah it sounds like he missed three years of school due to yuberculoxis and peritoniti8s .
20617,"wow , that 's terrible . i 'm glad he survived . that m , so have been hard . i guess he developed an interest in music them ."
20618,yeah it would be interesting to hear their story . i would also ; ike to know how they all met and came together i 1960 when they formed .
20619,i guess they were all in liverpool . i guess they played in the same clubs . i guess they were not doing to college or uni .
20620,following their dream taht i great . i think it 's cool that the beatles experimented with several music styles ranging from pop and indian music to hard rock .
20621,stat is teh best trying about them . they did not just do the same stuff agains nd again . they traveled . hey explored .
20622,yeah that 's a really good point . the beatles once literally stopped touring because current am ; ljification technology could n't keep up over screaming .
20623,it would hav been pointless anyway . the fans are nit listening . theyd wanted a beatles experience . i would not have gone myself .
20624,yeah if sounds super crazy . i can just watch from the comfort of my own computer . speaking of computers someone build a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks .
20625,i am amazed that they would even try . that must have taken forever to build . i wonder why they did that .
20626,yeah i ca n't even imagine . also smoking near apple computers voids the warranty by making it a biohazard . i am definitely glad i do n't smoke !
20627,what about vaping ? can you vape ?
20628,i do n't know about vaping .
20629,"not if they could n't vape anymore , they would n't ! lol anyway , great cha t !"
20630,yeah and they even have industrial robots controlled by computers . so surprising . nice talking with you as well .
20631,"i do n't know about you , but only retail that i remember from my childhood is watching my brother play the legend of zelda on our nintendo 64 . did you ever play that game ?"
20632,"i do n't play that game but i love nintendo and il ike playing mario , always a favorite !"
20633,"i guess the company was first founded as a card playing company back in 1997 , making it over a century old"
20634,"that 's crazy ! i had no ideas ! i really like pokemon go , i like the handheld consoles that they made just for that game . my son plays soo and always wears his favorite lucky pokemon go shirt lol ."
20635,"that 's fun that you have something you can enjoy together . nintendo also owns the mariners , meaning they do more than just video games . if you 're at a mariners game , you can use a 3ds app to order food to your seat"
20636,"it is great fun to play the pokemon gf with my son , so nintedo owns the mariners ? ? wow , that 's crazy and interesting ! t hey also produced lego knock offs at one point !"
20637,i wonder how long that venture lasted . they also created the first racing game to run at 60 frames per second . it 's crazy how much technology has evolved over hte past few decades
20638,"i know , technology is amazing . i bet we see more and more pretty fast . i wonder if nintendo has any games that you can play tennis , that would be fun !"
20639,i know the wii sports as tennis on it . i think i remember here also being a mario tennis amy for teh 64 as well . do you play tennis ?
20640,"i love tennis , but do n't get o play very often , but i do love tennis games and i do believe they have one for the wii . i will have to check it out ! it 's funny the me all the businesses nintendo tried prior to going to games on the 70 's , they tried everything hhaa"
20641,many businesses that are now successful have similar stories . they learn yawn to pilot until they find something tthat is profitable . now they 're one of teh largest and bestknown video game companies in thye word
20642,"here true ! i wonder if nintendo eve tried navy clothing lines , like shirts and shorts , but i guess there are always clothes with brand names in graphics on them . they are huge , valued at over 85 billion dollars ."
20643,"since they own the mariners , i wonder if they technically do have some clothing . sometimes we know this by heir brand rather the the parent company"
20644,"very run . i bet they have made clothes , it would be a huge market bust to sale . teens shirts or even polo shirts like they wear in tennis ."
20645,"what 's funny is that polo shirts started with tennis players before it was later worn by polo players . the na , e is deceiving"
20646,"i heard that , pretty interesting . i believe rene , the crocodile , lacoste was teh designer of polo shirts ."
20647,"that 's what i 've heard . what i did n't know is that here 's a difference between a button down ad a button up , depending on whether the collar tips fasten o these shirt"
20648,"really ? haha , i did no know that , hmmm . that is as funny as in china gangs fashion involved layering as many shirts as someone could pull on and on ; ping teh collars , every knew that was a thing !"
20649,i think i 've seen photos of that before . it ' foot any stranger than hte aloha shirt being th official business attire in hawaii
20650,"right ! but is pretty cool thoug h , i am sure they love wearing shirts like that ."
20651,it 's probably more comfortable . billy mays funeral pallbearers wore khaki pants and blue shirts to his funeral
20652,"hello , do you watch tennis ?"
20653,"yes i like tennis more than i used to , especially when the williams sisters are playing ."
20654,yeah trey are great . do you know the relation between tennis and polo shirts ?
20655,"yes i think that polo shirts were invented for denis players . i like polo shirts myself , do you ?"
20656,yeah i like them . it was indeed rene lacoste the tennis player
20657,"oh ok , did you know a black man won the first us tennis open title in 1968 ?"
20658,yeah and the sad thing is that no one has won it ever since
20659,"yes that 's true , my mind keep goin back to tiger woods , but i have to remind myself tiger woods was n't a black man ."
20660,yeah . nad once they had to use a helicopter to dry a tennis court
20661,"wow that must had bee now important and valuable game , i 'm surprised that warm was n't postponed ."
20662,yeah true . do you know how lion was the longest match in tennis .
20663,"if i am right the longest tennis match went for 11 hours within 3 days , great 's a pot of energy pr a player ."
20664,that is true . how about video games ?
20665,i am surprised that nintendo is nd not was the world 's largest video game companies by market capitalization .
20666,"yeah , an ai is over 100 years old now since it was founded in 1889"
20667,did you know nintendo owns the seattle mariners ? nintendo release handheld console for pokemon ?
20668,oh i did not know that ? they also used to be a yoy company and created a lego knockoff then
20669,"oh really , have you heard of the arrow shirt tolls . those were my favorite shirts in my teens ."
20670,i have actually not heard of them . do you kno whoo polo shirts were invented ?
20671,"no not really , how were the polo shirts were invented , if you know can you brief me short details ?"
20672,"they were invented by the tennis player , rene lacoste . nice cha"
20673,"hi , how are you this morning ?"
20674,im doing great . how bout you .
20675,"i 'm good , thanks for asking . do you like tennis ?"
20676,i have never reall sat down to watch it to be honest .
20677,"i witch a little , mainly he open when it 's playing . do you realize a black man has not won te us open tennis title since 196 8 ?"
20678,thats crazy .
20679,"yeah , you would think with serena and her sister venus domination on the women 's side , wa black amen would represent , as well ?"
20680,you would thin tthat he . maybe they should grunt more . i guess it gives ou a leg up in tennis .
20681,apparently ! lol i just learned recently that polo shirts were originally invented or tennis .
20682,i didnt know that . i used to play table tennis . do you like babe tennis .
20683,"yes , i played as a kid . was pretty good actually , i picked it quick ."
20684,you dont get really good until ou learn to put that side english on the ball . lol .
20685,true that q even played nintendo ?
20686,al lke time when i was a kid . love me some mario .
20687,"me too , 9 did n't relaiz4 they started out as a playing card company way back in 1889 ."
20688,a long time age they have time a long way huh . did you know that nes had online gameplay capabilities
20689,"yes , you know they are the 3rd most valuable company in japan with a market value over 85 billion ?"
20690,wow . that is really amazing . a lot of money .
20691,"yes , it is . did you know nintendo owns the seattle mariners ?"
20692,thats cool . guess its really truth ow big of baseball fans the japanese people are .
20693,"yes , they are . i 've visited japan many times , they are crazy about baseball and video games . well , it 's been nice chatting with you this morning . have a good day , friend !"
20694,"had 's it going , have you 've ever played nintendo games ? it was founded in 1889 way before video games were made"
20695,"i , like nintendo very much . especially fzero which is the first racing game to run at 60 fps"
20696,"it 's crazy how much stuff nintendo use to do before video games , like cab services and love hotels"
20697,thy even made a lego knockoff before they produced videogames . they have a great many videogame franchises
20698,"yea i love mario , pokemon , nad zelda , they are all great franchises"
20699,the newest mario game is supposed to be very good .
20700,yea it 's pretty good . did you knw nintendo owns the seattle mariners ?
20701,"yes , that ton have a 3ds app for ordering food to your seat , crazy !"
20702,"i wonder if nintendo owns and other sports teams , the do have a market value of 85 billion"
20703,that value is probably why they were able to release a console specifically for pokemon
20704,i wonder how much the original playing cords nintendo made in 1889 are worth now
20705,"there are probably many other items that they made as well , i wonder if they ever made polo shirts"
20706,"nintendo did make mario tennis games . tennis is a pretty crazy sport , the ones match was 11 hours"
20707,there haven even many intresting tennis matches . the first place cma won the 1st us open title in 1968
20708,it 's odd that a black man has never won the us open since then
20709,just one year after that victory they used a helicopter to dry the field t the us open
20710,it 's crazy polos were originally invented for rene lacoste
20711,gangs in china used to have polos and op the collars
20712,"interesting , did you know the pallbearers at billy mays ? funeral wore blue shirts and khakis just like mays us veto ?"
20713,that is interesting that they didn ' 5 wear buttoned shirts
20714,"well i got to go , nice cahtgting with you"
20715,hi . how are you ?
20716,i ' doing wel lol are you ! ?
20717,i am good too .

20720,have of seen any of the new spider man movies ?
20721,i ahve seen the one before this recent one . i will watch the latest as soon as i can .
20722,can you believe a teen infected himslef with mercury at least three times in an attempt to convert his bones to metal after seeing xmen ?
20723,yes a hat is crazy stuff .
20724,it realy is ! can you believe michael jackson tried buying marvel in the 90 's ?
20725,no i did not know that . i did see that in the opening to 1990s spider maw as performed by joe perry .
20726,wow that is awesome . i wonder if it was good ? i 'll have to listen to it sometime ! do you know where the word brainiac came from ?
20727,i remeber a brainiac character from the superman comics when i was a kid .
20728,thats where it came from ! i ca n't believe dc comics only paid 130 oscars for the rights to superman !
20729,yes that was a great deal for them .
20730,"marvel does great things though , did you hear what they did about a kid with hearing aids ?"
20731,no i have not .
20732,"seem kid wass ayn tthat superheroes do n't wear hearing aids to his mother , so marvel created a superhero that does . so cool !"
20733,that was a cool thing for the it do .
20734,it really was ! anyways nice chatting with you !
20735,you too . hav a good day .
20736,thanks !
20737,"hello , do you like marvel ?"
20738,oh yes very fun company ! i am happy with how teh walt disney company ahs handled things since acquiring them in 2009 .
20739,me too . i saw marvel started in 1939 .
20740,yes it has been around for a while . but at that time they were called timely publications .
20741,very cool stat right there . they once created a superhero or as boy who was deaf .
20742,such an ice thing to do . re you referring t blue ear ? i love when companies do thigns like that .
20743,"yep , that is blue ear . use a good thing t o . melt amy heart hearing stories like that ."
20744,it really does ! do you like the marvel character spiderman ? he is the only character who sony has the rights to !
20745,i love video man . i did not know that sony had rights o bum .
20746,yes back in 1998 they bought the rights to 10 million !
20747,wo stat 's a lo of money . i saw the military i straying to make a spiderman like abilities for soldiers .
20748,"hah that would be epic ! there was 700 comic issues of the amazing spider man ,"
20749,that 's a lot ! sad that stan lee passed away this year . he brought a lot of joy to the world .
20750,i was sad to hear about his passing . he left a great legacy though . he received 10 percent of the net profits of anything based o his character !
20751,that 's very cool he got that legacy . do you read comic books ever ?
20752,i did in the past . i liked both marvel land dc comics . dv strands for detective comics .
20753,me too . i for n't know that 's what it stands for . very cook to know .
20754,"if you ever want to see the larges ftpuboicly available comic book collection , just go to he michigan state university library !"
20755,that 's hilarious . i 'm not too far from michigan so i 'll have to drive up there and check it out one day .
20756,yeah that would be really cool to see . it is a huge market and it was valued at 1 . 09 billion collars iman 2016 ew all it was lovely being able to talk with you today !
20757,for sure ? good chatting with you today !
20758,"hi , how are you ? do you like marvel"
20759,"hello , i am doing good this morning . yeah i like marvel ; me ans my son ar always watching superhero movies ."
20760,"nice , me too although i am not a huge fantastic four fan . i think the movie killed it for me . . ."
20761,"get , we havnt seen that one yet , and he isnt a 'the age toga et into comic books yet ."
20762,that makes sense . sony turned down most of marvel ? 's characters in 1998 and spent 10m on spiderman . that was not a great choice but spiderman is making some money .
20763,im not big o spiderman . i know if probably makes them a lot of money but i personally think xmen is a lot better show . it wouldnt ahve hurt disneys wallet any to throw in another 15 million for xmen . im sure marvel came out on that deal anyway .
20764,yeah ! i too love xmen . i ow nthe dvds of all the cartoons . j will throw them in every few month and get nostalgic about the . really like the . who 's your favorite
20765,"wolverine . i like the story behind him , and he just seems like a real dude as well ."
20766,yeah . he 's one of my favorites ; i always felt bad for him . i like night trailer the most though . i like his powers .
20767,if i could pick on power to have it would be professor savior . to be able to read and control minds would be crazy .
20768,"yeah , taht would be nice . did you know there is ac character that is owned by both marvel and dc , named access ?"
20769,"i didnt know that , whats h alike ."
20770,he looks al little corny wish blue costume and red piling but his job is to stop the two universes from becoming t e .
20771,"oh yeah . if they did what a world i would be , huh . so why do you think spider man has always been so popular . i just dont see it ."
20772,"i really like the first one but the new ones have been tough to watch . i do like andrew garfield though . i heard 3 companies own his rights so they all have a spin , which is why there are a lot of them and differnt version ."
20773,"3 companies uh . i think they need to stick to one storyline at a time , and really go creep into it . i want a story that makes me want to watch it to see what happens next and spiderman just doesnt do that for me ."
20774,i agree . i heard the new spiderman universe cartoon movie was really good . i would like to see that one .
20775,i hadnt heard of it til now . its just crazy the amount of money trey make from this kind of stuff though .
20776,hear . i just saw the guest avengers movie on netflix and was surprised to see hi mon there . . .
20777,i thin they is good in roles like that . just one of the group . i dont think the story is interesting enought o malek a series based just on spider man .
20778,i agree . nice chattin with you !
20779,are you a marvel fan ? they just released a new marvel ' fantastic four ' comic book last week .
20780,i do like marvel but not the fantastic 4 really . what about you ?
20781,i like ' the amazing spiderman . ? marvel is discontinuing publishing the fantastic four so i guess its ' not as popular .
20782,now that 's sad . i may not like it but in n't it a staple n comic books ?
20783,marvel offered rights to sony for almost all its characters for 25 million but htey rejected . they would 've made a fortune .
20784,"man , tha would suck to be that ceo . . . lost billions ! maybe someone can pick up fantastic four and pump life into that !"
20785,marvel finds all kinds of ways to make and save money . they even argued in court that xmen are not human so they can pay a lower rate .
20786,weird . . . the us military is trying to archives spiderman like abilities . i would love to have that tech !
20787,densely probably has the rights to it though . bum they do n't have the right tos how ' big ' marvel characters int heir theme parks east of the mississippi due to contracts with marvel .
20788,really ? that 's odd . stan lee would probably get 0 percent though . . .
20789,"marvel has some good traits though giving a hard of hearing boy who didn ' pant to wear a hearing ai a superhero ? , he ear ."
20790,that 'd b ego cool for a little boy . im glad they could do that !
20791,"did you know that dc stands for detective comics , not washington , dc"
20792,that 's interesting . i did not know that . die you know access is owned by both dc and marvel .
20793,"i was n't aware , bur if you like the marvel comics , then head to michigan state university for the largest comic collection in the world ."
20794,"really ! im an il , it guy so i cant team on that campus . . ."
20795,spiderman 's opening was performed by aerosmith 's joe perry . no wonder it 's so good the music .
20796,that 's a interesting . i like the perry !
20797,stan . was rich . he got 10 percent of net profits of anything from his characters and the firs spiderman god 800 million in revenue .
20798,i would have taken 5 percent ! can you imagine being that rich ? i bet ne 's not doin hits .
20799,marvel event had a wedding in 1987 for spiderman with stan lee officiating . he probably got paid big too fdr that one .
20800,"hi , how are you ?"
20801,"hi , i 'm good . how are you ? do yoy read any marvel comics or watch they movies ?"
20802,i do . i really like the us do you ?
20803,i like some of the . i am hoping there area ore movies now that walt disney has bought marvel . i imagine marvel characters are at the theme parks too .
20804,"probably . there will probably , y be a whole wing of the park for them and star wars , now that they own them too ."
20805,i am sur that you are right bout that ! did you know that disney does not own one rights tot he big marvel characters east of the mississippi ?
20806,"i did not but now fast i am thinking of it , i may have seen thor at universal i orlando ."
20807,not probably did . marvel signed a contracts with universal back in the 1960s o disney ca n't show the characters at disney world but they can at disney land .
20808,i think disney would be able to do more with them in terms of movies an rides . but universal probably has plans . . .
20809,i bet they do . you know sony had the chance . buy them but only bought spiderman because they thought that was all people would care about . they were so wrong !
20810,yeah ! there is one charatcher that is owned by marvel and dc . have you heard about this person ?
20811,no i have n't . what 's the snoop on tha t ? i had no idea dc would own something with marvel .
20812,i guess his name is access and he makes sure teh characters do not cross into he other universe .
20813,"talk about taking stuff too seriously ! i mean , they are only comic book characters n a comic book universe . then again . marvel was able to argue in court that mutants are not people in order to pay a lower rate fdr the action figures . i ca n't imagine going to court to argue about xmen !"
20814,"what if the financial difference was hundreds of millions . it 's worth w to t , right ?"
20815,i guess you are right about that . i just do n't know how i would keep a straight face east he lawyer or judge though .
20816,"i am sure there are a lot of cases that both people laugh at but if it pays off , it would be worth it . if marvel or dc has inhouse lawyers , they are salaries so snake them earn their keep !"
20817,"true , very true ! i bet it was fun working forms tan lee too . i heard he always edged every those call with th worded excelsior !"
20818,i wish j way a cool line like that when i hung up the phone . do you have one ?
20819,"no i do n't but i wish i did too . you 've got to be a long onformist i think in more to be as creative as he was you know what i mean ? ne was smart too . his company published a generic comic book so they could trademark the names superhero and supervillain . ,"
20820,nice chatting with you !
20821,the venom movie is coming soon . are you going to see it ?
20822,"well , it doe star tom hardy . so maybe ."
20823,"he was one of spider man ' villains ,"
20824,j know . i wonde why they decided to use venom in this movie . i like dome of the other villains
20825,"venom is a catchy nra he wonder if it will be true to the comic book , or go its own way ."
20826,i thing it too n't be true at all . they peed to attract all sorts of audiences .
20827,deadpool stuck loosely to hte comic boo rand does very well . a franchise .
20828,"of course , ryan reynolds is great , and very funny ."
20829,who revert thought that comic cook villains could become subjects of movies ? sort of an antiherto .
20830,"yea , people love tha stuff . also , all sorts of hero movies the in at this time . did you know marvel published a generic comic book in order to travel mark the names superhero and supervillain ?"
20831,"it doesnt ' surprise me . rumors are tha carriage , another spider man villain , wall be venom 's antagonist ."
20832,is carriage evil ?
20833,"oh , yeah . carriage . even more ethan tha venom ."
20834,what makes him so lethal ?
20835,"he has power similar to spiderman , but i san alien ."
20836,thats crazy had no idea . i wonder if he was human at some point too .
20837,"no . carriage is an extraterrestrial parasites , and is an enimen of venom . i think the long range goal is eventually tie everything together into a spiderman megamovie ."
20838,"wow , amazing . who is playing peter parker now a days ?"
20839,"no idea . they have different batmans all the time , why not spider mans ."
20840,always felt george clooney was the best .
20841,spider man ahs been so successful . sony bought teh rights for 10m in 1998 . what a bargain !
20842,"how 's it goin g , do you swim ? people are able to swim week after birth"
20843,"i 'm afraid to ask what elmo testified to centre about . something about funding pbs , maybe ?"
20844,"maybe , or maybe elmo cheated on his taxes"
20845,"lol . sorry , i did n't see your initials comment . no , i do n't swim . do you ? i remember the swimming baby on the cover of nirvana 's nevermind ."
20846,"yea i there is a pool around , i 'd really like to learn how to do the front crawl thaat native americans introduced to the british"
20847,"interesting . i do n't live near a pool and the water outdoors is very cold here most of the year , but i do a lot of walking or cardio ."
20848,"i like to watch swimming on the olympics , he us almost as many gold medals in swimming than the rest of the world combined !"
20849,"i wonder why the us is better at swimming . i never watch hd olympics much , but it 's interesting how countries develop a division of labor oj what they 're goo dat ."
20850,"i do n't know , maybe it has to do with the swimsuits . the olympics stir ban one swimsuit worn by 94 percent of the winters in the 2008 races"
20851,that 's weird . i wonder what they thought was unfair about it i ? 'd have thought choosing swimsuits fo characteristics that aided speed would just be an accepted thing .
20852,"i guest not , maybe congress found somethings proper bout he olympic swimsuits"
20853,i do n't get my . if it was available fdr everyone to wear .
20854,i guess everyone did n't have access to it . did you know there is a type of swimming were people swim just like dolphins ?
20855,"8 noticed that . i 've heard of some weird ideas for sports , gut that 's out there . on the subject of shoes , my good york boots have lasted me about 6 years but it 's about time to get some new ones at the surplus tore . do you have many pairs of shoes ?"
20856,i think i have 2 pairs of shoes . it 's crazy there is 5000 year old shoes tha tper4fofrm better than modern shoes
20857,"i ' knot surprised , considering how much stuff today is deliberately designed to fall apart so you have to buy more . sounds like you 've got about as many shoes as i do ."
20858,i wonder how reliable the 15 shoes stephon marbury promotes are
20859,i should google he . but i really need heady boots i usually get army surplus or steeltoed lineman 's books .
20860,i think i need to buy some tea bags from my shoes to see if they really do absorb odor
20861,"i usually have a lot of used teabags , so i should try that too ."
20862,"well i got to go , nice chatting wath you"
20863,hey there . i live in state ny near cornell . student there must pass a basic swimming test before they can graduate .
20864,"i 've heard of a few school who have that require , must . that might be why the us has more olympic golds in that than the other countries combined"
20865,could be . wonde if we have ever won anything where the swimmers arms and legs are bound nd they have to big like a dolphin .
20866,"that would be an interesting one to watch in the olympics . maybe they 'll allow them to wear the swimsuit stat is not based . it 's so good that in the 2008 olympics , 94 percent of the winners were wearing them"
20867,that 's interesting . i like matching swimming in every summer olympics . it is always jong the top public recreational . sport too .
20868,hte native americans were even avid swimmers . the british only knew the breaststroke until teh active americans beat them using the front crawl
20869,that 's cool . the british also chose to name congress for the 13 colonies to uber recognized as a self governing entity .
20870,the term congress even dates back to the middle ages and wa fused for a party during battle
20871,cool . i heard elmo is the only nonhuman to testify before the us congress hahaha
20872,"dad he testify , or did his puppeteer testify ? that 's a bit of a gray area if you ask me"
20873,"true , kinda like fantasy congress here players draft members of congress and get points for legislative success . kinda nerdy if you ask me though ."
20874,"unless hat 's what you ' r studying . i 'm not into politics enough for that , but i would like to see the baseball game between the republicans nad democrats in congress"
20875,that would be cool . they have done that annually winder 109 . pretty cool
20876,"the republicans are winning by three , b ut it would only take a few years for that , a to change"
20877,"true . i like that there are subway lines between the capitol , house and senate buildings for exclusive us ebay congressman . probably gives them more time for basebal l ."
20878,"three different lines , too . maybe that was a woman 's idea . it 's funny how a woman was elected to congress before women had the right to vote"
20879,"tru , it 's amazing in today 's world that women could not vote back the nine 1916"
20880,i know . and that means she was voted in entirely by men
20881,good point . i just hope elmo never gets to vote . i just saw that steve smith from the nfl carolina panthers leaves his cleats on the field after very game to raise awareness for homlessenss . intresting
20882,"considering that modern shoes do n't perform s well as shapes from 5 , 000 years ago , he 's not losing much by leaving them there"
20883,"well , if shoes lasted a long time these days , then shoe companies wouldnt sell a many goes . like ballet dancers who go through 4 pairs in a week ."
20884,not to mention the shoes that get throw nkohut due to their smell . one comedy for smelly shoes is using dry tea bags
20885,dry tea bags ! that would be cool . but not on my daughters soccer cleats l no way ! lol it 's funny how fashion dictators shoes having heels or not and how high . comfort was what i need .
20886,i like when comfort and styles meet in the same shoe . it 's the best of both worlds !
20887,do you liek to swim ?
20888,"i love swimming . do not think that i am a professional , i am not a professional ."
20889,it 's only . most people swim for recreation and exercise .
20890,i can only doggie parade . do you like to swim ?

20892,that is sweet . who is sour favorite swimmer athlete ?
20893,michael phelps
20894,i saw him in the ellen degeneres show . h was teaching andy how to swim .
20895,that was cool . do you know that native americans introduced the front crawl swimming to the west ?
20896,what is the first crawl swimming ?
20897,"just like it sounds . it , mostly uses hand strength . the british people only used breaststroke before it was introduced by the native americans ."
20898,ia n't that like the butterfly strokes ?
20899,"i think it is similar . by the way , the us received a many as gold medals in the olympics in swimming as the rest of the world combine ."
20900,"well , then maybe our practices increases way more stability ."
20901,for sure . did you hear that there was one the of swimsuit that was banned by th olympics ?
20902,"maybe , biking were banned ."
20903,it has nothing to do with appearance . it was because 94 percent of swimmers wearing the banned swimsuit won the races during 2008 olympic .
20904,that is weird . what a ridiculous situation .
20905,"it is . also , c cornell university students must pass a basic swimming text before they are allowed to graduate . that is a ridiculous reuireemnt ."
20906,that is ridiculous . i would definitly lose . food thing my major it not in cornell .

20915,i did too . there is an actual university where you can study science fiction and fantasy literature it ha concentration of tolkien studies ! i 'd be reading the ; world of the rings everyday !
20916,"that sounds like a nice university i wonder if george r . r . martin ever attended that university , maybe he can be one of the teachers one day ."
20917,"that would be awesome ! i wonder if the janitor who wrote a 15 , 145 page fantasy manuscript listened in on it ?"
20918,"a janitor wrote a 15 , 145 page manuscript ! woah he must be really famous by now wonder if his work . any good ."
20919,it was only discovered after his death unfortunately ! he did have 300 watercolor illustrations in it though !
20920,"300 of them ? that sounds impressive and to bad , maybe his manuscript is really good , he could ave been a rich man ,"
20921,oh for sure ! do you like science at all ?

20935,cool . did you know stan lee used ti end all of his phone conversations wit h ' excelsior ! '
20936,no i did n't . i heard stan lee wanted spiderman to have a hyphen so people redid n't confuse i twitch superman . makes sense to em .
20937,"i agree . there are so many superheroes , i can see why people can ge they confused ."
20938,"yes definietly . did you know he rival of cap'n crunch , c called sogmaster , exists in marvel . he ha fought spiderman . ha ya"
20939,i didnt know ciao ' b crunch was a superhero . thats pretty cool .
20940,"i know , ha ha . have you seen the movie black panther ?"
20941,"i havent , i just saw that its on netflix , so i hav veto check it out ."
20942,oh i did ' realize it was on netflix learn . i 'll have to watch it . did you know that marvel invented a superhero called blue ear just to make a 4 year old boy feel better abou wearing hearing aids ?
20943,"ish and about that . that is the best . i love things like that , it helps kurt kids realize that they are ok ."
20944,"definitely . everyone needs to feel , ike they have super powers , but especially kids having a hard time !"
20945,"plus , that way they feel great it is ok to be different ."
20946,"yes . did you know the largest comic book market is japan , and that france is another large market ?"
20947,"i would believe that in japan , but didnt realize that i france ."
20948,"yeah , french people really like comic books , manga , and graphic novels . there i sa long tradition of comic book in france ."
20949,thats pretty cool . only didnt take the rights to marvel characters in 1998 . they say bought spiderman
20950,wow i think disney owns part of marvel too .
20951,"just no 'the bi character like the xmen , and avengers . i am not sure who that leaves though ."
20952,"oh okay . well speaking of cool books , i ' likd veto someday visit th comic collection at michigan state university . i'ts the largest comic collection in the world . ; and its open to the public ."
20953,that is pretty neat . i bet it is pretty diverse .
20954,yeah . they bust have comics from all over the world
20955,probably a lot of older comics too . that would be that to see the development of comic .
20956,am . i think marvel started in the 1930s or so .
20957,"it would be cool if they even had stuff that predated marvel , if that 8 seven a thing ."
20958,i think there are comics ay before that .
20959,"i think it is cool to they have different universes , even within the same franchise ."
20960,"yeah , but not is a smart business decision to do that ."
20961,"i think it was even neat that marvel published a genre comic book , just so they could trade mark superhero and supervillain ."
20962,totally . smart decision .
20963,that is why thy are legendary . its been great chatting !
20964,same here . have a good evening
20965,you too !
20966,"since h nwas created in 1962 , spiderman has really become popular ."
20967,it relaly has . i have not followed it much ut tiger have at least 1 or 2 dozen movies . its amazing sony rejected buying th erigths from marvel for 25 million . they really missed an opportunity of a lifetime !
20968,the 1960 's real was the silver age off comic books .
20969,"being born in teh early 1960 's , i remember restoring mom when we went into town try let me get a comic book . t seems to have had a resurgence of late . did you know that marvel created a blue ear superhero for a year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing his necessary hearing aid . the boy told his moms perheres do n't need hearing aids . that was really an amazing gesture from marvel comics !"
20970,"spiderman 's alter ego peter parker lived an ordinary life as an orphan im the co , mic ."
20971,how stan bleed dreams up thugs stuff is amazing . peter parker is an orphan who gets bit by a radioactive spider to get his spider abilities ! did you know thay stan lee hgphenated spiderman o that he woul knot be confused with superman ?
20972,he ca climb walls and shoot spider webs . sometimes i ish i could do that .
20973,"those are interesting superpowers , but i rather the iron man suit . spiderman made a brief appearance in the third avengers movie ."
20974,"the marvel characters have superpower s , but are written as human , one . peter parker had to deal with issues of adolescents and finance ."
20975,"it sees that is the same with most of them . ha issues win a superpower father ego . did you know thee was a spiderman broadway musical ? it happened to be the most expensive broadway production , 57 mill , and had numerous delays and injuries . at one tim emit closed because its injury insurance was canceled !"
20976,te musical is probably worth more than teh 75m that sony could have paid for most of the marvel franchise in 1998 .
20977,true . what i find amzing is the collector ' market for booth marvel and dc comic books . did you know marvel once publishes da generic comic book to teademakr the names ' superhero ' and ' supervillain ' .
20978,"there is even a character shared by both marvel nd d , whose purpose list o hero the comic universes separate ."
20979,i heard but that . i guess hat is why dc comics ' superman ' and ' wonderwoman ' are never parr of marvel 's avengers . did you know that michigan state university has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world ? the must be mecca for comic book riders and collectors !
20980,i wonder ho war back their collection goes . comics appear ton ave originated in japan in the 18th century .
20981,supposedly comic books took off in the us and the uk in 1933 with the publishing of ' famous funnies ' . famous funnies was a reprise of a collection of newspaper comic strips with simple plots . i am not quite sure when ' real ' comic books appeared with longer story lines of all genre and not restricted to humorous tones .
20982,marvel as a history almost that long . it started in the 1960 's asu timely publications . in 1916 vita acquired the marvel name .
20983,"they really have an impressive history . but many of the founding creative geniuses have passed away . stan lee died in november 2018 . do you think the can keep the momentum going without th genius of stan wee ? stan had an interesting eccentricity . he ended each phone call not with good bye , but with ' excelsior ! ' ."
20984,"disney owns marvel now . if abyoenc an maintain a franchise , it 's disney ."
20985,"true . disney has kept george lucas ' creations , star wars and indiana jones , goings strong for some time now . its interesting taht disney ca n't have a marvel characters in their theme parks east of the mississippi . apparently marvel , prior to the disney acquisition , gave those rights to universal studios ."
20986,"i 'll be like stan lee , and end this conversation . . . excelsior !"
20987,"trees are interesting , i didnt know they could change their gender"
20988,i was just reading about the air penasylvanic7m that can sit from male to females . had you ever heard . that before ? ?
20989,"no , thats new for me , didnt know trees had a sex apparently this can be determined whe they bloom"
20990,"i kno w ! this particular tree is a striped male found in the us and canada . i wonder if that affects if they produce , apple scrub or not ."
20991,"i do n't know but it sounds like its ' a weird species , it can take a mere three weeks to bloom and can stitch seems , that must be a pretty unique capability"
20992,"eight , apparently its ' triggers to switch from male to female if there 's ben damage done . i wonder why that would be ? ?"
20993,"koi think heres a lot to learn about this tree stil l , theyd rent sure why it can change see and i guess there a lot to learn about the tree , maybe info that will change hew we view nature"
20994,"not only that , but apparently the worry is that climate change will cause more damage , and make more female ds , and less males , which could be the end of the species . that 's sax ."
20995,"it is , specially if we dont know how to control that , maybe we willl earn before its too late , not producing enough fruit can have consequences on the ecosystem as well"
20996,"on a lighter note , did you now it 's illegal to own a rabbit in queensland , presumably australia , unless you are a scientist or hae a magician 's license ! !"
20997,"i didnt , thats interesting the emperor of japan is az scientist i guess he can own a rabbit tin australia if he ever decides to leave over and go to live there"
20998,"lol . i did n't know that . i do think rabbits are found in a lot of literature , especially fantasy literature e , liek alice in wonderland or watership down ."
20999,so you like fantasy literature ? george r . r martin is one of my favorite authors
21000,"trying to think if there are any rabbits in game of thrones lol but seriously , who does n't like fantasy ; it ? i was surprised to find out it 's a pretty , modern genre , with most writting since the 1960s ."
21001,"i cant recall any lol . , and yeah , i cant believe its a modern genre i wouldnt know what to do without fantasy in my life ,"
21002,i read a lot of fairy tales when i was a kid . would they be classified as fantasy ?
21003,"yeah i think they are , speaking of got , you know that george r . r martin was unsure about putting dragons into the mix , good thing he did ,"
21004,"no kidding . they make great tv . but i would like to read his books , as well . i imagine they 're pretty good . have you read the books ?"
21005,"yes , the are as good as the series , more details in the books fantasy novels are great"
21006,i read that one fantasy author amazed peer brett wrote his firs ibook o his phone while commuting . that 's amazing !
21007,that is amazing ! i guess he took advantage of that unused time commuting
21008,"hi there , do you like superhero movies ?"
21009,not really . i find they ave too much cgi . what about you ?
21010,i like some of them like spiderman ? do you know why there is a hyphen in the new ?
21011,i have no idea why . why not just one word ? other superheroes have names like that .
21012,because tan bleed id not want it confused with superman
21013,"ok , i see . i guess that makes sense . stan the man knew what he was doing ."
21014,"for sure , he was a legend , did you know marvel offered the rights of characters to sony but they only bought spiderman ?"
21015,i think they did not foresee the appeal of superheros to a public served for entertainment . a mistake on their part .
21016,"yeah do sure , they could have made much more now . do you know who did the voice of madame web in the spiderman series back . the day ?"
21017,i have no idea . madame we ? do n't know .
21018,"yeah it was actually stan lee 's wife , joan b . lee"
21019,i guess he chose her for the job . i never really watched he show .
21020,i see . i spiderman musical is the most expensive production on broadway
21021,"a broadway production of spiders , an ? that 's an odd choice . not very typical ."
21022,"yeah , i know . it cost 75 million and the music and lyrics were done by bono of u2"
21023,"i guess there i sa star factor there , but i would not want to read my money on tha investment . too unusual . tv and movies are better for superheroes ."
21024,yeah i guess . have you heard of he superhero named access ?
21025,"no , i have n't . is that marvel or dc ?"
21026,it is the superhero that maintains the balance between the two and they both own it
21027,"that 's great ! i guess they are frenemies of a sort . well , i enjoyed chatting ! have a good night !"
21028,same her . have a good one .
21029,"i 'm not a big comic fan and i 've only seen the first spiderman movie , but i 'd like o ' moe of them ."
21030,do you like captain crunch ?
21031,the cereal ? i liked the crunchbrry kind when i was a little kid . do you ?
21032,"yeah , the cereal . do you eat cereal ?"
21033,"nah , i usually eat a bogut berry smoothies for breakfast . you ?"
21034,hilarious ! do you like michael jackson ?
21035,not really . i mostly listen to 90s grunge and punk . i respect his skill as a musical artist though . are you a fan of his ?
21036,i think mj was the greatest musician ever . do you agree ?
21037,"it 's hard for me to rank artists in different genres , but in terms of technical skill and creativity he 's definitely n the top rank . re spiderman comics , one reason he was so popular was what the older generation of comics only ha teens as sidekick to adults , and he was the first teen to be a superhero in his own right ."
21038,wow
21039,"yeah . i notice that in the old ' greatest generation ' era of comics the teen sidelines were always about a head shorter tha the adult superhero , kind of like buds on father knows best . like they were trying o infatnilize them ."
21040,hav eyou ever read the first spider man ?
21041,"nah , i 've never been a much of a comics person , but i 'd like to catch up on the movies . you ?"
21042,"yeah , me either . did you see tbh movie glass ?"
21043,i never heard of i . be honest . was it good ?
21044,"it was n't that good . i did n't like the end . they killed bruce willis ' character . lets just say , he did n't ' die hard ? '"
21045,"i 've never sen thay one either , l ol . i gues si should , since it 's such a big part of pop culture ."
21046,nice . did you know dc comics paid 130 for the rights superman ?
21047,"i only read what recently . that 's amazing . in out a believer in copyright in the first place , but paying that little fo nra copyright that you can used to keep the creators from using their own ideas is especialy awful ."
21048,"hilarious , did you know google purchased the domain gmail ?"
21049,i thought they originally owned it because it sas a google application .
21050,"yeah , that is crazy ! well nice chatting with yo !"
21051,i find science fascinating . how about yourself ?
21052,id o tho ! especially natural science .
21053,were you aware that the emperor of japan is s scientist and still publishes papers ?
21054,i had no idea ! how fun . the world wild web was invented by a scientist too . it always thought it would have been an engineer r .
21055,that is interesing . i would have thought the same . it 's strange to me that the term scientist was n't even come until 1833 . i wonder how they referred to previously ?
21056,maybe htey were just called philosophers ? have you seen where they put the picture of the horse on dna ? i saw it th mother day on the news !
21057,that 's possible . i did see that . i do n't understand how they fit that much data in dna .
21058,me either . it 's astounding what can be done . do you like to read ? my fave is fantasy .
21059,"i do like to read . as far as fantasy , i do respect jerry pratchett and find him quite numerous ."
21060,it 's amazing to me what people can use fantasy for . did you know the fantasy draft the national spelling bee ? i was surprised !
21061,"i did no be they will fantasy draft anything now it seems . when i mentioned terry pratchett , i just recently learned tha te was knights due to his literature work . i 'm glad he received that honor ."
21062,"i had no idea . i have n't read much of his work , but my son loves his lit ."
21063,"i rave read some andc e is great . since you mentioned fantasy drafting earlier , people also draft members of cognredds ."
21064,i did not know that ! dod yo know people were writing fantasy novels in the 2nd century ? i was reading about hat type other day !
21065,"i di not . wow , fantasy has a very long history . i do love game of thrones . apparently george rr martin was hesitant to include the dragons puts someone convinced him . i am thrilled that they did ."
21066,i loved got . i wonder if the books are better then the show ?
21067,"i decided not torn did them . i have friends that did an the said that he is way too descriptive . he will have a whole section describing phd blood at a dinner . i 'll stick to hte show . but as a side note , it was a person named phillies einstein that convinced home about the dragons ."
21068,oh ideally ? the dragons were fun . u found it hard to keep up with the show sometimes . i felt like martin chad us all over the place for a fantasy .
21069,it does get complicated . i love the intrigue though . i am amazed that the longest work of fantasy is three million words long ! that ' insanely long .
21070,"that is a lot of writing . i once heard a janitor in chicago wrote a 1 , 00 page manuscript , but i have never marsden it . he must have been writing for awhile ."
21071,i wish he would have started it . he potentially could have had a lucrative career .
21072,i would love to read it . i guess he did a lot of illustrations in it too .
21073,i would love to see that .
21074,hi how are you ? are you interested in fantasy ?
21075,hello ! i 'm doing great ! i am to a point ahha how about you ?
21076,i know a little about the genre . i read fantasy lit when i was younger . tolkien . you ?
21077,same here ! i 'm interested in what this fantasy congress is though !
21078,"i guess fo political junkie and policy looks , it is a lot of fun . for me ? no ."
21079,"me neither haha . i want to read that fantasy novel taht was written in the 2nd century ! it talked about the moon , aliens , and we between planets . my mind is blown !"
21080,wow . that is quite imaginative . i wonder who wrote it . that us amazing !
21081,i 'm still in shock people though tofu that back then . it does make me believe in aliens haha . i do n't know if i have time to read the longest work of fiction ever thoug h .
21082,is hat the one by the janitor ?
21083,no but close ! this one had 3 million word sin it !
21084,that is insane . i wonder how long it took to write that many words .

21086,i like science . i enjoyed it in high school . you ?
21087,some here . there was only one scientist tat has walked on them so which is nuts !

21089,i hole so because i feel they put allot he work in !
21090,yes the scientist stand engineers dont get to enjoy the fruit of their labor ! maybe elon can change things .
21091,i hope so ! t hat 's cool that japan 's emperor is a scientist ! we need minds lilke that in more in control of society !
21092,"there will b epa new emperor in japan this year . yes , we need more scientists and people trained in science . anyway , great chat !"

21096,did you happen to watch deadpool 2 ? i thought it was so funny ! !
21097,"i have n't seen it yet . i hear it 's funny , but not very family friendly . is that true ?"
21098,"not at all family friendly , it has a lot of blood and material that its not appropiate for the family ."
21099,are there a lot of big names in teh movie other than ryan reynolds ?
21100,"not really , not tha ti know of bu there some cool charaters like cable and colossal ."
21101,"i usd to b , big comic book fan and colossal was one of my favorites ! best his the movie that introduces the team for ?"
21102,"yes its the team that introduces teh force , you know the video game actually had a higher cost to make han the movie ."
21103,tha is really interesting and i hope the the was worth it ! are you a fan of comic books data ll ?
21104,"i am a fan of comic books , is ad stan lee died ."
21105,"at least he lived a long , productive , and successful life ! i am also a fan of comic books , but it is an expensive hobby at i stopped collecting a while ago ."
21106,"h did , he ended every phone conversation with the phrase excelsior , and i can see wh its expensive although it can also the considered as an investment ."
21107,"i guess if i am bale to drive to michigan state university in east landing , i can read what i was without costing an arm and a leg . their library has the biggest comic book collection available to the public !"
21108,"thats a great idea i be they have al ot of intereting comics in there , do you also like dc comics ?"
21109,"i do . i used to e all about marvel when i was younger , but i got into dc later . that about you ?"
21110,"i do like them as well , dc comics is called detective comics , i didnt know that ."
21111,"ha ! so detective comics comics ! : , you mentioned stan lee earlier . although the creator of marvel comics , he actually wrote 15 dc comics !"
21112,"wow i did knw tha t , i bet those comics are pretty good , i wonder if there are available at the michigan state university ."
21113,"they might be a good place to start ! i guess not all superheroes are in comic s , because i heard the u sis home to 300 registered superheroes ."
21114,"so many superheroes ! there is a superhero cal ; led normalman , i bet he is a lousy superhero lol ."
21115,"i ca n't imagine he has a lot to offer , but it sounds sort i interesting ."
21116,"he has a hard job though , he lives on a planet that 's full lof superheroes ."
21117,hello ! di you see the movie deadpool ll ?
21118,"yep , i loved it ! apparetnlh so did a lot of people because it 's one ot he few rrated movies to be among the highest grossing of atl tiem ."
21119,nice ! i did n't know that . the deadpool video lame cost mores pod make than the movie !
21120,i never even knew there was a video game ha ha . have you played it ? did ryan reynolds voice the mystery villain like he did in the film ?
21121,i nerve played it . i 'm not sure if he did . ironically in the 2001 comic book deadpool described himself as ' ryan reynolds crossed with a sharply ' . that led reynolds to believe he was destined to plays she role .
21122,he las destined to play the role since the deadpool character was butcher in that xmen movie . destiny required they do the character justice this tme .
21123,lol do you read comic books ? i have n't read them since i was a kid .
21124,i really only read manga and alan moore comics sometimes . did you know they 've been around in japan since the 18th century ? ?
21125,my ones lot is a huge range fan . i remember one of the first book series he was into when he was younger was one piece . i had no idea they 've been around since then . i know the first modern comic boo kin the s came out in 1933 .
21126,one piece use great ! you should look into it . it gets better after the first few chapter . and is n't that comic called famous funnies ?
21127,i have no idea ! lolol i had enough of a time trying to figure out buying one piece books for him . that was all so new to me . did n't understand the genre . was a big learning curve for me . lolol
21128,"ha ha , i can understand that . if you were a superhero , you 'd be normalman ! apparently he 's an actor superhero ha ha ."
21129,haha . good stuff ! there are over 300 registered superheroes in the us .
21130,we should go an register too . you ever heard of one punch man ? you can be genus and i 'll n santa all we 'll be the best out of those 300 for sure .
21131,nice ! my son would love that i 'm sure . ahha i 'll have to look up one punch man . when i grew up we ha garfield comics . lol
21132,"day , the classic that is garfield . he became a superhero noce . hes toured the pet force ! now , that would be a weird comic torn dead ."
21133,yes . i think that came along after my time as well . lol i just googled one puns man . my son loves those japanese anime shows lke that as well .
21134,your son sounds like a cool cat yo . but is he as cool as a lee and say ' excelsior ' to end his phone calls ? ?
21135,lol that 's great ! i just learned that dc from dc comic stands for detective comics . i had no idea .
21136,"hte more you know , i tell ya . did you also know that stan lee wrote for dc as well ? now that is one heck of a shock to me ."
21137,i did not know that either ! lol i 'm way behind the times . it 's been a real pleasure chatting with you . thanks for giving me good thoughts about my son !
21138,same to you . hope you and your son have a great day . bye now .
21139,"hello mu fined , excelsior ! what do you think of the article ?"
21140,"i through the article was amazing , i am a huge fan of marvel and comic books sand was nice to read about the . how about you ? what were your thoughts"
21141,"i got into the market universe with the movies , so i can not comment on the comic books . but saying that i loved deadpool and the how ran reynolds is carrying the role ."
21142,"did you happen to see ryan reynolds first appearance a deadpool ? i believe it was in wolverine origin movies . what i found most interesting was that the video lame cost more to make than th movie , dead ; wool ,"
21143,"yes , but i hated how it ended with him being weapon x and sewing his mouth shut ! hte character is known for his snarky humor , they cast a great characters in that movie fdr e . g . gambino . i did n't know about the video game that 's na interesting thing to know . were there any other force remembers in comic sa ; part from what they have shown in the movie ?"
21144,there was a handful that was missing from force but really he team is just comedic timing .
21145,i just read in the article that there was comic with garfield and his gang as pet one . that got a chuckle out of me imagining odie as a super powered dog . do you like garfield comic strip ?
21146,i can only imagine garfield eating his way thouhg problems and odie fixing everything
21147,"haha , that 's true an door jon our be pulling his hair out . just a question , di marvel do comic books series like dc 's eldeworlds ?"
21148,marvel does som any comic and there was so many topics back in the 60s and 80 im sure that thy would have anything . just last week marvel released a league of legends themed comic with riot games
21149,"wow , the more i get to know about this stuff the deeper it goes . it 's interesting to note that michigan state university library has the largest comic book collection publicly available in the world ."
21150,"yes , i found that extremely interested an di wished i would ave known tha sooner s i no longer live in the region i would have spent a good deal of time there . but what i did find funny was that dc meal detective comics . but they go by dc comics"
21151,"that would have been great , right ? all the comic books yo wanted to read . yes , the dc and comics again seems redundant , what did you think of lazier beet as domino i think she got the role right with her attitude as happy go lucky survivor ."
21152,"some did do hte role very well . but i think what really got me was you had bot josh brolin , played thanks and cable and i they mcu every does a crossover it be weird"
21153,"haha true that , i used to think what would happen if fantastic four , before hte new rehash , did a cross over with avengers who would chris evans play the human torch or captain america ? ryan reynolds as green lantern would probably cover do a cross over with deadpool universe but the end credits fine put a bullet in it literally ."
21154,"all it would be captain america for sure , though i heard that deadpool will no longer be making another sequel but maybe make one more movie as force"
21155,"hear , i am like waiting to see how end game was out wb ut i thought the force was dead with all of the in chunk literally . though i would love to see a wolverine and deadpool team up if possible ."
21156,wolverine and deadpool team up would be cool but really just want to see a hulk vs flat he animated short films are amazing and seeing a bulk vs deadpool would be gun with the very with a mouth
21157,it really is sad to see copyrights marrying such great ideas of having superheroes ll supervillain team up . i loved how the tried to include the planet hulk timeline in thor : ragnarok but i think a standalone film would be better to connect with the character .
21158,"yes agreed , but i would highly recommend teh animated series when watching some of the marvel universe as they are able to do so much more without the copyright restrictions as oppose to live action . but one thing for sure is i definite over to do more research on ' normalman ' that would be a fun read"
21159,"i would have to check that out too , wand normalman rounds find i would also check that out ."
21160,yep between normalman and the female reimaginwtiions of she marvel universe would be good . but a live action film with a multiverse would be cool like the new animate spiderman would be next level and interesting .
21161,"let 's not get it the multiverse right only , it 's too huge for my mind to comprehend right now ! not i have been hearing great thins about the new spiderman i did n't get to see it yet ."
21162,yes the new spiderman i basically done my marvel with sony 's permission . 3rd is in there
21163,did you watch deadpool ?
21164,"yes i like the first deadpool a lot of he second one i did n't think was as good but i did like josh brolin as cable , what did you think"
21165,"i di n't watch the first deadpool but enjoyed the second . i hae heard the first was webster zoo maybe better that i watch the second one first so i don ' tiger disappointed haha ! some people thin , deadpool 2 was funnier though and i do like comedy ."
21166,"well you should see them both because they are both pretty good . i do like the first one a lot more . it 's a lot more tongue and meek . also , i cant ' believe that they did n't king the first director back , they should have definitely done that it may have been a better movie"
21167,did you ever read the comics ? hardcore comic fans seemed to lament the incondsistencies between the comics andc the films .
21168,"i 'm not that into comics so it does n't bother me , but i guess it would bother some people , did you ever play the deadpool video game by the way ? i did it 's really good"
21169,i am not too into video games . the video game cost ore than to make the movie !
21170,"that 's very impressive ! and yes the video game was awesome like i mentioned , also the movie is the highest grossing rrated firm o all time , if you do n't include movies directed by jams clemson or george lucas"
21171,"i thought it as a really unique film , quits different hand the other superhero films because it was just for adults , and rated r , not pg 13 ."
21172,"yes i agree ; it was a breath of fresh air , you should also know that ryan reynolds does the voice of th mystery villain at the end of deadpool 2 , i 'm not ruining anything for you though haha"
21173,"in a 2004 comic deadpool describe himself as brynn reynolds crossed with a sharply , so reynolds thought he was destined for ther ole ."
21174,"that is really funny ! i 'm glad they were able to get ryan reynolds in the movies then , do you rap any other comic books by the way ?"
21175,i do n't really . i tried to et into them when i was in 3rd grade because it was trendy in my school . i just found out that the dc from d comics maker it redundant !
21176,"that is crazy ! and you 're right , dc stands for detective comics so you 're saying detective comics twice that 's hilarious"
21177,ave you heard of marvel 's generic comic book ? it was published in order to trademark superhero and supervillain .
21178,"no i did n't hear about that . i ' , l have to check it out i sounds interesting . i also want to check out the library at michigan state university , they have the word largest publicly available comic book collection"
21179,i wonder if they have any comics containing normalman .
21180,i 'll have to check it out ! waht do you think about stan lee by he way ? he was such an icon and would end every phone call with the word excelsior lol
21181,"i did n't know much about hime ut yes , he is certain ; y iconic . his legacy will live on for a long time !"
21182,"yes i agree . what other superheroes do you like ? speaking of in too , stan lee wrote bout 15 is comics which i did n't know about"
21183,"i like the punisher , maybe because he 's kind of ' normslish '"
21184,did you know there are over 300 superheroes registered in the us ?
21185,"hell ! interesting , i wonder how one registers and what the roe entails ?"
21186,"that is a good point , to be honest im surprised it 's so low you 'd think there would be haha"
21187,"with ws many comic book fans as there are , i 'm surprised there is n't more too . do you read or like comic books ?"
21188,"all i did when i was a kid a little bit , i looked at a comic shop recently and comics are like 57 dollars , and theyre kinda short you can finish them in 10 minutes , so it seems like theyre not worth it to me , . what about you ?"
21189,"i was similar except that i had a few years when the dc relaunched their ' new 52 ' of trying to out thin . i mostly stick with digital comics , but it was a very expensive hobby and i could n't stay with it ."
21190,"it is excessive , i get why , it 's a lot of work to draw and come up with stories and print everything , but ya it must doesnt ' seem like its worth the money to me , also funny is theres a superhero called normalman , he lives on a planet of superheroes and is the only one without a power haha"
21191,i would n't want to be that guy ! lol . did you have a preference between marvel or dc when you used to read comics ?
21192,"bill i liked omen s a kid , now that i 'm older i like batman the best but thats the only dc character i like , below him would be xmen , spiderman . , etc i think marvel has tire characters that i like but batman is my favorite , you ?"
21193,"i was pretty much all marvel , with a couple exception when i was younger , and then became reall dc the second time around . it 's funny i did n't realize dc comics was like saying detective comics comics ."
21194,"haha no i did n't know that either , kind of like how gmail . com was originally purchased from a garfield forum because thats what the name gmail was based on"
21195,you learn something new every day . even garfield had his own superhero series called ' pet force ' so i guess we all have the chance to be a superhero .
21196,"haha thats true , i wonder if tha i sun of the registered superheroes s , allow did n't kno stan pee wrote 15 dc comics"
21197,"it sees odd , almost traitorous , does n't it ?"
21198,"haha it does , i guess e reimagined batman and superman in this of how he would change them , which sounds cool i 'm going to look heat up"
21199,"if you are near east landing and can stop by michigan state , they might trust have those as htey have ther largest publicly available collection in the world . i wonder if he have sort of a ' marble ' spin to the dc characters ."
21200,"oh wow , feel i do live in michigan , i 'll have to check that out sometime , cant ' believe id died n't knw that actually haha"
21201,that 's funny . i 'm in nebraska and not as close . for fun i looked up if we had any registered superheroes and it did n't appear so !
21202,"ah melt hat 's too bad , maybe you sould e the first person to make a registered nebraska superhero !"
21203,"too bad there is a ' normalman ' somewhere in the multiverse of ours . : ,"
21204,"haha ya , i do n't know maybe just mr . nebraska will have to do haha"
21205,"hit turker , do you like superhero movies , if yes , do you have a favorite hero ?"
21206,il ike spiderman and i am interested in deadpool but i have n't seen it .
21207,"my favorite superhero is tube incredible hulk , i hav n't seen deadpool either , but wonder how good dis the movie ."
21208,it is the highest grossing rrated film of a ; ll tiny not directed by james cameron or george lucas .
21209,"oh , i heard it is very funny . hav eyou seen avengers : infinity war ?"
21210,"no , i hear the movie was different then the comics though ."
21211,"i saw x , en , i like the empire movies , my favorite is wolverine and iron man ."
21212,"back to deadpool , it took ryan reynolds 1 years to get his vision aoc deadpool made . that is a long time ."
21213,"yes it is , so that much mean that he was thinking about this movie for 11 years ?"
21214,that is impressive . what makes a great actor .
21215,"yes it does , are you a fan of comic books , if you are , how many books do you have ?"
21216,i am not . but appears thet their is a lot of money in the industry .
21217,"yes , you are right , i have lots of comics books , 8 am not a reader , i like them for the drawing of the characters ."
21218,"that is interesting . dc co , in paid 130 in 1938 for exclusive rights to superman ."
21219,"yes , superman and archie rich are two of the most valuable book i heard of according to my knowledge ."
21220,i think its funny that marvel comics spent 10 years convincing the us governement that x men are not humans .
21221,"that 's true m i did n't know taht deadpool was made just to make people laugh , i am not used to seeing superhero comic movies ."
21222,i agree . i can not believe that there are at least 30 superhero movies set to be released between 20162020 .
21223,"wow taht 's a lot , did you see black panther , if yes , did you like the movie ?"
21224,i did not see it . did you ?
21225,"do , i saw it once , but i did n't like it , because the actor who played the black panther won so many awards , i think the other actor , i forgot his name , deserved those awards ."
21226,naive talking to you .
21227,"hey , did you see the new deadpool 2 movie ? it came out this year ."
21228,no . i was suprised to find out it was r rated and not only that the highest crossing rr dated film not directed y james cameron or george lucas !
21229,"yes , that surprised me too . did you know the movie cost less to make than did the video game ?"
21230,"nope 3d id n't know that ! to be honest i 'm not into superhero stuff although i do , ike te fact there is a super hero normalman !"
21231,"wow , that is intriguing . there are over 300 superheroes which are registered in the us !"
21232,"yes . i was deprived as a child , my mother would n't have some books in the douse . as an adult i find the graphics mixed with the words jarring . i do n't read manga either ."
21233,"h i see . yeah , i was never as into comic books either . however i find them interesting . do you know what the dc sands for in dc comics ?"
21234,"'d , it stands for detective comics . i think that aspect is what got my mother so opposed to them ."
21235,"i see . yea h , it 's kind of interesting since dc comics is a bit redundant . did you know michigan state university contains the biggest publically available collection of different comic books ?"
21236,i read that somewhere . i wonder if they allow people to looks t they or if they are microfished or digitized ?
21237,i do n't know . i 'd want to find that out . wh the you think of having ryan reynolds in the lead role in deadpool ? he seems like a good fit .
21238,"not having seen the movie , or knowing th storyline beyond the bare basics , i ca n't say . what did you thin ?"
21239,i think he is excellent . the screenwriters said he also voiced the mystery villain .
21240,so pick a superhero name and a superhero power . i 'd be reader girl and mcd superpower would be knowing everything that had ever been written !
21241,"i would want to eb like the invisible man , s o taht i could gt some peace and quiet wherever i wasted . be great to ' disappear ' during meetings at word , k , soo ."
21242,"well , i can see some advantages to being invisible , but when you disappear a work they the to fire you q"
21243,trump . maybe i can change to a different universe . the marvel cinematic universe takes place in the earth 199999 . that seems like a fun place .
21244,"yes it does . that woudl your uniform or outfit be as a superhero ? i would ear glasses , have spiked hair , thigh high boots over begging with a toxic . it think maybe black with re accepts . my hair would b silver ."
21245,"i like blue and black . i 'd want to wear something like from yugioh . i would want silver hair , too , though ."
21246,copy cat !
21247,"wel , you know what the regard limitation . they had a garfield book spinoff clue diet force , did you know about that ?"
21248,"hi , how are you ?"
21249,good ! are you a star wars fan ?
21250,"cool , yes ia m . how abou thou ?"
21251,"i do enjoy them , especially the original trilogy"
21252,"me too , those are the best . do you have any of the memorabilia ?"
21253,i dont . you ?
21254,"yes , i still have my original lunch box with heros from whe kid was a kid . it 's banged up sour , bt i'n ever part with it !"
21255,"that is awesome . i still have some things from my childhood i cant part with too , like my glow worm ."
21256,ahh ! that ' z so sweet ! merchandising has always been really big for star wars . you know it holds a guinness world record for mostly successful film merchandising franchise . pretty impressive q
21257,it is . star wars is legend . it wa panned so many years !
21258,that 's a fact . did you realize taht james earl jones only spent 2 1 or 2 hours recording his darth vader lines and only got paid 7500 l 00 ?
21259,that is nuts ! that voice is so iconic . do you know marcia lucas is behind a lot of the films main scenes ?
21260,"i had heard that before adn that she had actually won the academy award for editing , while george did not for directing ! wonder how he feels about his ex wife ?"
21261,"i dont know , some break ups art amicable , she did help out a lot with the movies fro that it seems like ."
21262,"well , that ' sure ! i still ca n't believe 20th century fox thought it was going to be a flop ; !"
21263,"i know , didnt harrison ford not want to be credited initially because he though it would not do well ."
21264,"boy , many people ha tthat all wrong !"
21265,they really did here we are almost 50 years later and it is still going strong !
21266,that 's my childhood ! it shocks me to see that the value of the star wars franchise is 54 billion !
21267,and that makes it only the 5th highest grossing media franchise . i wonder what beat it ?
21268,"yeah , it makes you wonder ? well , it 's been nice chatting with you this morning . iv ' e got to head into work . hope you enjoy the rest of you day ."
21269,do you likes that wars ?
21270,yea i like the original trilogy . apparently the force awakens was selected to e local in a vault on butterfly
21271,"frozen was not too far behind , haha ."
21272,"yea , i guess younger people do n't find the force awakens that interesting and prefer back panther"
21273,interesting . ? i have n't watched black panther or the force awakens . have you watched bot h ?
21274,"i 've saw some of black panther , could n't get into it . i heard get out was good"
21275,"k havent watched that either . i guess the only knw ish wave watcher dis frozen . the song is quite catchy . before let it go was written , elsa was the villain in frozen . because the song was uplifting , they changed er character ."
21276,"yea , i 'm surprised frozen was the first female directed disney animation , i figure there would be one sooner"
21277,it 's interesting that the did bot want to call it snow queen because feminine titles dont ' perform as well .
21278,yea i do n't think the title ' snow queen ' would have stopped it from grossing a billion at the box office
21279,"'the write of let i the has won an emmy , grammy , oscar , and a tony . heck knows his stuff !"
21280,"yea , robert lopez is pretty talented , he also co wrote a south park episode"
21281,interesting ! i really should watch more movies for myself and quit watching them with my kids . i have been meaning to watch black panther .
21282,"yea , apparently the book panther character is th ericehst superhero worth 500 billion"
21283,"yeah , it 's suprising toy stark is only worth 10 billion ."
21284,yea and bruce wayne is only worth 0 billion
21285,black panther was going to e called black leopard at one point l i wonder if it would have been as popular if it kept that amaze .
21286,lol i don ' 6 know . i also beaver knew the black panther comic predates the black panther party
21287,"yeah , i wa wondering if it had nwythingt o do with hte black panther party ."
21288,"yea , apparently denzel washington funded chadwick boseman tuition for an oxford university theater program , t hat 's nice"
21289,threw as really cool of him . over 0 years later boseman thanked whim in person .
21290,did you see the force awakens ? it cam cout n december of 2015 .
21291,"hello there , i did , i thought it was pretty good . how about yourself ?"
21292,i loved it ! i am a huge star wars fan . jj abrams did a fantastic job o note score .
21293,"yeah i thought he did really well . and , i know hoe tough it is to take on a star wars project , the fans are really intense ."
21294,it is the 35 an dove crowd that supports star wars .
21295,"yeah that is true , i guess only 32 percent of people between 25 nd 34 saw the film ."
21296,that age bracket preferred black banter ? star wars .
21297,"yeah i read that a well , did you see the black panther film ?"
21298,i did not . i 'm not really into he marvel an dnc comics films . i fell off that genre way before the 18th film of black panther .
21299,"yeah i did not see it either , but i would to i had the chance . i do n't watch ny aoc the marvel movies except for the xmen film i have seen some of those ."
21300,"black panther is worth 500 billion , way more than tony stark 's 10 million ."
21301,yeah i was surprised they made a superhero more wealthy than stark and bruce wayne .
21302,george lucas i soso talented randb vegan stab war he 1977 . i wonder waht his ne worth is .
21303,"yeah that wa some creation , i wonder what he though they was starting way back when ."
21304,james earl jones must have had no idea because his pay was only 7500 for voicing vadar .
21305,"yeah , but when you read how long it took him to do it , i would say thats some pretty good dough per hour !"
21306,that 's true ! those movies are o good and deserving of their hrs . 5 billion box office .
21307,"yeah they are , do you ave a favorite of all of the star wars films ?"
21308,empire stripes back fro 1880 is my favorite typo rewatch . how about you ?
21309,"yeah , i would have to agree , i think me an doyou are like most people as well when e pick the one ."
21310,it 's a good choice ! nice meeting you !

21313,j do like the star wars films from back in the day .
21314,they made awsome films for the time ! realy groundbreaking .
21315,george lucas was crazy ! crazy lke a fox . he knew that there was money in them toys .
21316,"oh yea , they agreed to et him forgo 500 k in direction fees for licensing !"
21317,"half a million sas al ot of money in those days , bu i guess he saw th longterm potential of the franchise . now he is a billionaire ."
21318,"wo , apparently james earl jones spent 2 . 4 hours recording reg lines for star wars and was paid 7 , 500 , i wonder how much that is mow ? ,"
21319,"probably four or five that number . in 2013 , star wars was dubbed in navajo , making it the first major film to be dubbed in a native american language . i wonder if james ha anything to do with that project ."
21320,"that 's interesting , and kind of interesting thing not to do regularly ."
21321,i do n't know how many navajo fans there are . george never won an oscar though .
21322,that 's sad considering how amazing his moved were
21323,the academy has a lot of politics . he made hte wrong kinds of films . his wife got an award .
21324,what did she get an award for ?
21325,oscar for editing . she helped shape the film too . a lot of plot points were her ideas .
21326,that 's awesome ! have you seen frozen or black panther ?
21327,i have n't seen either . i now that bp wa sup for an oscar . that was strange to em . a comic book film ?
21328,"i could't call it a masterpiece , but it certainly held my attention . i have a daughter who i thought would be a little too young at the tim for frozen . i was wrong , and now she loves it ."
21329,"that 's rat ! i bet it has a lot of great songs too . is house see it . it was directed bu a woman , yes ?"
21330,that 's pretty cool ! itd poes have strong female characters .
21331,"that 's good . little girls need role models too . anyway , i enjoyed chatting !"
21332,you too !
21333,are you a star wars fan ? there are so many movie dont that i va n't keep track of them all .
21334,i do like them but have n't seen the new ' solo : a star was story . ' have you ? what do you stick of hans solo if you have ?
21335,i haven ' 6 seen it either . i think thatd disney wil . try to do a backstory movie on every character . ' r2d2 and chapo : two robots in love '
21336,i like harrison ford . he made solo so loved . his charater was such a skep6ic .
21337,"beat , he balanced out the mumbojumbo of the force . i wonder how he comes off in the new film ."
21338,did you realize that al pacino was chosen to take the part of solo but he turned it down because he did n't understand the script ?
21339,i bet he did n't . he really would have made a strange solo . i know that sean connery was offered the part of sandals but said no . casting is key to the success of a movie .
21340,very true . christopher walked was also considered by lucas to do hans cold . that would have made a difference too .
21341,"a much darker , more booking solo with great dance moves ."
21342,george lucas ' wife had a large impact on the movies too . she won an academy award for editing he first star wars film .
21343,she got hit oscar that george never got ! oh well . he 'll just have to be continent o be a billionare . i wonder what he does everyday besides count his money .
21344,poor james earl jones at that time only made 7500 for recording all of darth war 's line in the original star wars . it took him 2 . 5 hours . i guess though that is n't too shady when you think about it .
21345,nobody really knew just how much money would be made . i bet the next movie paid handaomely .
21346,20th century fox thought he would f ; op . they sure were wrong !
21347,what 's bow lucas got the merchandising rights and the cash to set up lucasfilm . he really tumbled smart .
21348,"i wonder if e 'd agreed is the theory that there is only once electron in the universe ? how does tat explain all the universe of planets , stars , and galaxies ?"
21349,only one electron in th universe ? that sounds like a crazy theory ! how come only one ? have you heard that the universe might be a hologram ? maybe we are just an entertainment systems or some alien race .
21350,sometimes it seems like that . can you imagine that you can actually touch some stars because their temperature is lol enough . how do they burns so bright ?
21351,"fusion i the source of a star 's energy . i think that if we barns the power of fusion in our lifetime , many energy probe will disappear . flying electric cars for everyone !"
21352,"i wonder if lucas thinks about all these things when he films ? interestingly , star wars was made dubbed i navajo in 2013 . this was the first major film to be in that language . sounds like they have a lot more success to come ."
21353,star wars would very wells e thye firs tseries to have a sequel made on mars .
21354,that sounds very interesting . i wonder if lucas has stone convictions there ? lucas had originally wanted hans solo to be al marge green alien so it 's possible .
21355,"hi turker , have you seen the star wars movies , if yes , did you like it ?"
21356,i didn ' alike it wb ut harrison ford in cool . ditched and ironic is how id describe his performance
21357,"yes i like harrison ford also , u saw return of the jedi and he played his part well ."
21358,they say he was skeptical about doing he film
21359,"i wonde why , how did you like hte actor luke skywalker in star wars , i read , uber you and n't care for star wars , but just the actor ."
21360,camille looked like a goof . i hear he did n't want to do the sequel
21361,"hahaha , strange , but i always liked he show starr trek since back in the days , did you ever watch the shows ?"
21362,i watched star trek . its more intellectual . i do n't like these ' lord of the rings ' or ' game of thrones ' fantasy things . . . but harrison ford and star trek are the exceptions
21363,"ok , did you know james earl ones spent and 2 . 5 hours recording all of darth vader lines for star wars and was paid 7 , 50 in 2023 ?"
21364,he 's got the voice . christopher walked 's voice would 've added some edge
21365,"i did n't know hat , do n't you know hat george lucas became epa billionaire during th sar wars movies ."
21366,wow . luckily he did n't make solo a green alien as originally planned . else he 'd eb in the poor house
21367,it you know that there are star sin the universes hat cold enough to be touched by human hands ?
21368,really . does that make the theory that the universe is a giant superhologram more or less likely ?
21369,"j am hot sure but i would say more likely , there is a theory there is only one electro in the universe ."
21370,"wells , if space is pulling galleries out of sight . how will we ever know ?"
21371,"we may never know , i did n't know that al pacino turn down the role of han , he could n't understand the script ."
21372,maybe he should watch the navajo version .
21373,"al pacino turned down the role , christopher walked was considered the part of han solo in the star was movie ."
21374,"well , james earl jones mad cout well . 20th century too ! hey throught firt would flop at first"
21375,"yes that 's true . when george lucas nwas working on star wars , he initially wanted either a black actor or a large green alien to play han solo ."
21376,are you a fan of star wars ?
21377,"yes i am , i also like harrison ford , i think he is a great actor , what about you ?"
21378,i am as well ! i cant eboieve he much money the series has made . over 8 . 5 billion
21379,"i know that is really surprising , but ther ware 4 others that mad even more money ."
21380,thats still a lot of toy light saber !
21381,i heard marcia lucas had a lot to do with some of the great deal of the series .
21382,yeah she even won an academy award ! something george lucas didnt
21383,"yeah i heard he won the award for editing the film , you know star wars was the first movie to ever be dubbed to navajo ?"
21384,that really cool . i cant believe that fox gave lucas licensing an merchandising rights ! all because they thought the film would bomb
21385,"i bet they are regretting this choice and someone definetely got fired lol , its more cost them billions ."
21386,"the franchise its , 2 is worth 65 billion ."
21387,"i like that star wars explored the universe , although many things of the movie are fiction it made me wonder as a kid , you know that tenure are stars that are cold enough that can be touched with bare hands"
21388,thats crazy to think considering all the energy our own sun puts out
21389,"i know , i guess that energy runs out eventually , what do you think about theory of hte universe being a fan hologram"
21390,i gyess anything would be possible . even the theory that there is only one electron in the universe
21391,i agree i am willing to keep an open mind after lot theres a lot that we dont know abou 'the universe
21392,yeah and theres only an observable section that we can see . who knows what else there is
21393,"yeah so sad , into the star wars topic , did you know that back in the day al pacino turned dont he role of han solo"
21394,another possible regret . unfortunate that he didnt understand the script . christopher walked was also considered
21395,"i see , so ford is actual ; we lucky , you know han solo was a tie fighters before he evenbecame the pilot of the millenia falcon ."
21396,"yeah very lucky , he almost did n't get the part . was n't even allowed to audition at first ."
21397,"thats surprising ! i think hew was perfect for the part , w sell th new movie is also good and it grossed about 93 million worldwide ."
21398,i find fish to be very interesting . how about you ?
21399,"i do too , it 's intresting that the seahorse is the only fish with a neck"
21400,that is very interesting . have you heard of th black swallower fish ?
21401,"yea , th black swallower sounds lke a scary fish , it can eat prey time it 's length"
21402,yes and 10 times it 's own weight . that 's pretty terrifying . i wonder how it digest that ?
21403,i 'd like to know too . di you know a zebrafish shares 84 percent of genes associated with human disease ? they must be used for research if true
21404,i did not . i agree that we just really study them further . another that i would likd veto see studied it the jellyfish because some of them are immortal . we need to find out how and why that 's possible .
21405,the immortal jellyfish sounds like something from a science fiction love . i wonder how long the oldest one has lived ?
21406,that 's a very good question . if they do not get disease or injured they will never see so i wonder if there is an ancient one out there somehow .
21407,tat . pretty funny if there was n immortal jellyfish that was been singing human since ancient egypt
21408,that would be funny . do you know how freshwater and saltwater differ in how they consume water ?
21409,"yea , apparently freshwater fish drink throught herd skin by osmosis and salt water fish just drink through their mouths , i 'd would think it would be the other way around"
21410,you would think that . it 's very interesting . off topic bt do you enjoy disney films ?
21411,"i loved the lion king , it was the first disney movie to be dubbed in zulu"
21412,"i 'm g , ad tha they id that so others could enjoy it . did you know that the first animated disney film directed by a woman was frozen ? it seems like that took far too long ."
21413,"yea it does , he 'd figure with all the movies disney ahs made there would be a female directed on way before frozen came out"
21414,i agree . have you eve noticed identical scenes in any disney movies especially those from the 70 's ?
21415,"yea , i 've seen videos on youtube that show the identical scenes that disney recycled from the 70s"
21416,its ' because during that decode they recycled a lo of their frames . i wonder if that was budgetary of time concerns ?
21417,"possible , y . dod you know wreckitralph stared development all the way back in the 1980s ?"
21418,i did not . i 'm actually glad they took longer to make it though because they got to add so much other cool characters that would not have existed yet .
21419,"hello , have you seen the new a wrinkle in time ? oprah is i nit ."
21420,"actually , i have n't but i have read the original novel by madeleie single way back when i was in elementary school ."
21421,"that is a good book . this new movie is done very cool , especially the young actress , storm , who plays meg ."
21422,"yeah , i 've read she really felt a bond with the character . and really related to her on several levels ."
21423,i was surprised to find that meryl streep 's first role was in a sports movie .
21424,hey that 's pretty neat ! did you know she also speaks fluent italian ?
21425,"i did ot , i know her daughter plays an fbi robot on a series ."
21426,"yeah , som italian producer called her ugly , in italian , when she was addicting for king kong , 1976 , and she suprised him by responding in his language ! that ha to be embarrassing , huh ?"
21427,"that would have bee hilarious . she ' seen nominated for 18 academy awards , she 's awesome ."
21428,"yeh , it 's weird though , she 's been nominated 18 times , but only won 3 times . most have been some stiff competition or something ."
21429,"politics , lol . it even inflated was . i never knew her middle name was louise , that 's my grandmother 's lame ."
21430,"oh , that 's awesome ! speaking of awards , she 's also received 31 golden globe nominations and won eight . thats ' a lot of awards !"
21431,frozen was the first disney film to be directed by a woman . it 's about time they become more inclusive .
21432,"really ? huh . . could have sworn brave had been corrected who a woman . . . or maybe it was just cowriter by one , i ca n't remember . . . , i 'm getting old . . . ,"
21433,"i am too , lol . i can not believe disney actually recycled some of their animation frames , i wonder if the artists receive royalties dont have movies ?"
21434,"yeah , i saw a youtube video about that . . the recycled , for example epa ' dancing ' scene in snow white for their robin hood cartoon . did you know the toy industry gets involved in disney animations before the film production even begins ?"
21435,"neat is so insane . so is taking three decides to make wreckitralph , and i still dont ' think it 's a good movie ."
21436,"aahhh blasphemy ! i loved wreck it ralph ! ahh , well , to each is own , i guess . did you know lion king is the first film to be dubbed in zulu ?"

21450,the thief and the cobblers took 31 years due to lack of funding and complex of the annimation .
21451,it has a record ! it looks like the 101 dalmatians also had some money problems !
21452,"it does , looks like they had to heros some of the animated to save money"
21453,"but even though they kind of fell it lacks fantasy , i think they achieved a great result . it is fun of my favorite !"
21454,"he i agree , i would not consider 01 dalmations a fantasy movie"

21559,"never heard of that one . why 31 years , just a slow worker or was the nature of the production that it had to tale time ?"
21560,due to lack of funding and complex animation atleast it holds a record for the longest production tim for a motion picture of all time . . . thats crazy . do you enjoy fantasy film ?

21565,that i did know . the publisher was concerned boys would not read her books if they knew it was written by a woman . so htey made he rut jk o nthe cover rather than her name .
21566,wow ! t hate brilliant yet sad she couldnt be herself . it takes alot of creativity . did you head about the janitor in chicago and his art work ?
21567,"no , what did he do or make ?"
21568,"its inane ! he made a 15 , 145 fantasy manuscript with over 300 watercolor illustrations , he called it ' in the realms of the unreal ' it 's amazing , ive come across it more . it was found after hi death"
21569,"that 's dedication , i 'll have to look that one up . in the realms of fantasy there is terry pratchett and his novels . he created this whole world over tha span of about 50 books , e ahh one adding new details and characters . some people are devoted to it ."
21570,"wow , im gon na have to look that one up later , i find it all facinating ! i wish i would have known ther was an actual university where you can study science fiction and fantasy literature with tolkien studied , i love the weirdness . do you netflix ?"
21571,"yes we do , canceled our cable about a year back and now save about sixty dollars a year ."
21572,"me tolt it youtube and netflix , thats all k need . best decision ive made , sadly lol jk . funk chat ! ! take care !"
21573,i had no idea dc was doing this . do you enjoy dc ?
21574,i do but not a big fan . i do love wonder woman
21575,i do too . i loved the ww movie from a few years back . i think a lot of companies are going this route with streaming services . . .
21576,do you collect comic books ?
21577,i do not . i just enjoy the movies and cartoons with my 7 year ol ? do you ?
21578,i do as well . i remember going to see superman at the movie as a kid
21579,"i was too young to see it , like 4 or 5 , but i do remember ewing mad at my mom and dad for going without me , . . i was saddened with christopher reeves ' accident and dealt hp sweet like a little of my childhood was gone ."
21580,do you remember the tv version with george reeves in it ?
21581,i do not . i did love the dean kane version though .
21582,that one was my least favorite .
21583,i just liked louis lane . . .
21584,she got on my nerves in the older versions
21585,"ha ! i can see that . di you read factual section 2 ? ' superman wa one bitten by dracula . but because the man of steel is fueled by the sun , dracula immediately exploded . '"
21586,that is silly . i found it odd put you can not name your own child superman in some countries
21587,right ? sweden . . . that 's too bad because i was going to move there and name my next child metallica
21588,"my youngest ' na , e is ikea becuase of the store"
21589,too bad i was n't jc penny
21590,echo was your favorite nemesis in superman ? uni loved flex luther
21591,"i loved her luther too ! now that i am thinking of batman , i really loved the adam west batman . i still watch it when it is on tv land or similar channel ."
21592,yeah the old classic versions of these superheroes were always the best
21593,i remember thinking the bat cave was so cool growing it and now it 's just a few books with flashing lights .
21594,did you dress up with a cape too ?
21595,no . i di lot have a cape . i wish i did ! i would have worn it every day !
21596,comic heroes are big in japan too
21597,hey do you like comic books ?
21598,i love reading hem and used to collect them the i was younger . what about you ?
21599,yea hi mainly like marvel . apparently they published a generic comic book so trey could trade mark superhero and supervillian l
21600,"that sounds like it did n't work very well in te long run . it has n't kept other companies li , ged c comics from creating heir own superheroes and supervillain ."
21601,"i know with , it 's strange that was even an option . dc actually stands for detective comics . i did n't know what ."
21602,"it kind of makes the name ' detective comics comics ' a little repetitive , does n't it ? curious that they 'd do that !"
21603,"they pair to makes the name redundant . so weird . i thought stan lee was an amazing human , did you like him ?"
21604,"such lee wa alike the grandfather of can comic books , at least in my mind . i wish i could have met him to tell if tht , or even just to hear one ' excelsior ' myself ."
21605,"i would have liked toa s well . i never thought about when he marvel cinematic universe took place , i take place in earth199999 . not sure what that means but it 's a multiverse and different from hte original earth616 ."
21606,"i think a multiverse means multiple universes and exist having the same characters , which is why there are different ' canon ' v persons of the same superheroes . it 's pretty typical in longrunning comics ."
21607,the hat makes sense . have you ever been to the michigan state library ? it has the largest comic book collection in the world .
21608,"i have n't been there , but my uncle went to college here . unfortunately , i do n't think he cared about comics ! can you imagine the size of the collection ? i 'd get lost in there for days ."
21609,"wow , that is cool ! i wonder how many actually exist ."
21610,"probably too many to read in the , lifetime get you 'd probably have to devote a decade just to batman comics . they 've made so many batman t shows and movies nd have n't even come close to the number of comic book issues ."
21611,i never relaly got into the batman comics but i do love the movies .
21612,"i always loved the classic tv show with adam west , but that 's partially nostalgia from growing up watching it . which movies do you prefer the nolan ones , the new justice league ones , or others ?"
21613,"i enjoyed the animated series as well ss some of the new ones , my kids and i enjoy teen titans go !"
21614,"the classic animate deserted was fantastic . i have n't seen the newer ones , but i 've only heard good things about teen titans . ca n't say the same about the new ' titans ' show , though ."
21615,i hear about titans not streaming on dc universe 's streaming service but babe n't watcher edit . hav you seen it yet ?
21616,"i 've only seen the travelers for titan and to me they pushes 'the ' dark and edgy ' so far it made me cringe . i have n't heard many positive reviews either , so i 'm holding off unless things start looking up ."
21617,"oh well , maybe it 'll be good , if not kids still have teen titans ! haha , well it was nice talkin do you , i 've got ta run now , bye !"
21618,"when one thinks about the definition of the universe , one must include space and its contents , but also the dimension of time ."
21619,"yes i agree . it 's interesting that some scientists theorize that universes are subject to natural selection , kind of liek how species evolved on earth"
21620,"true . . makes sense that when something cataclysmic occurs , somethings weaker is destroyed . how about the theory that there is only one electron in the universe . silly that is not a serious theory ."
21621,"yes i do n't know about that terry , or teh theory that the universe is one giant hologram , 've though i know that 's waht elon musk believes"
21622,"i did not know that about musk . all , the fact tat there are stars cold enough for a human to safely touch tiem . surprising !"
21623,i would definitely touch one of thos star s ! do you like superman movies ? apparently he first made is appearance in the movie back in 1941
21624,i . like him as a character i movies . i think the early films were animated . who is your favorite superman actor ?
21625,i think christopher reeve is the best superman . i do n't like whatever new guy theyd ave rings now . what about you ? apparently you ca n't name your son ! daughter superman in sweden to lol
21626,i also preferred reeve to i like the villain brainiac too the comic book writer coined tht word .
21627,that is interesting because peopple still us ethan word a lot . did you know superman was bitten by dracula once ?
21628,no . did it have a effect ? i thought only magic and kryptonite could affect him .
21629,"yes the vampire bit him , but because superman is powered by the sun dracula immediately exploded lol"
21630,it aides some imagination to have that happen . i read the he was originally designed to be a villain .
21631,"that is very shocking . do you read any other comic books ? i read s lot that were created by stan lee , it 's too bad that hes passed away"
21632,i read a lot of marvel wand dc when i was a kid . i ahve not kept up . i liked the batman book character rather than the booking one in th movies . they have been around since 1933 .
21633,"yes that is defintely a long time . i 'm pretty although and even i know that dc stands for detective comics , even though that is redundant lol"
21634,yes . a lot of acronym create that redundancy problem . i do n't know if i woul drag about having the world 's biggest comic book library if i was a university ;
21635,"no i 'm shocked that they allow peope to read those comics because i know a lot o them area forth money too , i want to read the marvel published ' generic comic book ' though it sounds really boring but it 's probably funny"
21636,that generic go makes me curious . ia m going o look it up later . it allowed them to trademark some words .
21637,"ye thati as very smart of them . do you know if they trademarked the word excelsior ? apparently stand lee would alway sends his phone calls with that word , it definitely his trademark"
21638,i do n't know . i doubt it thoug . nice chatting !
21639,"good morning , do you like poetry ?"
21640,"i think i would be lying if i said yes , i have a passion interest in poetry at best ."
21641,"haha same here . did you know there is a poem that when read normally it 's depressing , but read backwards , it 's inspiring ?"
21642,that must take a lot of effort to create . like those pictures that look like one who from on eagle and soemthing else form a different one .
21643,"ia green . the japanese alphabet , w hen recited in order forms a poem ."
21644,intentionally ? i can name the odd poem but it as never really taught to us in school and i find it hard to appreciate .
21645,not sure if that was intentional . i saw almost all of hte hobbit character names are taken from old icelandic poems .
21646,"i would struggle with english poems , icleadnic are definitely not for me . i understand poetry used to be in the olympics ."
21647,me too . i once saw a guy named demetri martin wrote a 224 word palindrome .
21648,"you1 patched him write it ? i 'm guess nbc would not want to broadcast a poetry writing contest if t were still in the olympics , no such drama , so to speak ."
21649,i did not . it you like birds ?
21650,"again i have a passing fancy , we put up bird feeder outside the bake window m that is about it ."
21651,there 's an extinct dodo bird that is actually in the same family as they pigeon .
21652,"the fate of the dodo always makes my wife cry . they apart o ave been so trusting , which s what to their demise ."
21653,"yep , very very trusting birds . some birds way all the way from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping ."
21654,"i 'm the same when i fly , on planes that is , i just scan ' get comfortable . i understand some did , like ravens , a very smart ."
21655,same have . most birds have hollow bones so they weigh less to fly .
21656,"one niro tat always skates me laugh is the australian lyre bird , you should look it up on youtube if you a never seen it ."
21657,"haha yea i heard it can mimic sounds of cameras , car alarms , and chainsaws . lol"
21658,"if you get a second watch the video , i is remarkable how accurate it is . i 'd never heard of it but an australian friend of min nwas tully aware ."
21659,i will take a look at it . . was good talking to you . take care !
21660,"hey would you ever go to a poetry stage ? i do n't really like poetry muse , f so my answer would be no"
21661,"no i 'm pretty bad at poetry , i suck at writing patterns of rhyme"
21662,"well do n't despair , poetry has been round since about 25 cbe , and even the name is taken from ancient greet and means 'm taking '"
21663,"yea i remember reading some greek poetry in school like the odyssey , the greeks really liked their poetry"
21664,yeah they did . it 's interesting to that on poet wrote a poem that when read forwards is depressing but when read backwards it is very inspiring
21665,"yea that 's pretty amazing , it takes a ; ot of talent to make a depressing poem inspiring hen read backwards"
21666,ahha yes i agree . do you know what a palindrome i by the way ? apparently demetri martin wrote a palindrome poem that is 224 word in lenght
21667,i think ot 's something to do with words thing the same after a certain pattern but w or e it is i could n't write a 224 word palindrome
21668,on a different topic what do you think about birds by the way ? i did eat a chick fo dinner and it was delicious
21669,"birds are pretty awesome e , they are technically dinosaurs so i find it fascinating to see living dinosaurs"
21670,"yes i agree , it 's very crazy that they can range in size from 2 inches to over 9 feet"
21671,"yea , it 's crazy birds were the only dinosaurs to survive the extinction event 66 million ears ago but they are hardy species"
21672,what do you think about the dodo bird ? i 'm kind of sad that it is extinct but at least it is related to pigeons
21673,"u would love to of seen a real dodo , they look much cooler than pigeons"
21674,yep i agree . it 's crazy to me that bird bones are actually hollow and weighs less than their feathers
21675,"yea that is pretty amazing , so are the birds who migrate straight to mexico from alas , a without sleeping"
21676,"yes i wish i could stay wake that long lol , what do you think about hummingbirds that steal spider webs ? they use them to make nests"
21677,"pretty cool , i guess the webs must help kemp things together in the hummingbirds nest"
21678,"another topic , do you think we will ever go to mars ? apparently you word have a higher sounding voice on mars because of hte difference in atmosphere"
21679,probably not for a while due to all the iron oxide and other hazards on mars
21680,"it 's weird that there is bacteria that could actually survive on mars , i do n't think there is life on the unfortunately though"
21681,i love the first to man movie !
21682,i do n't remember it well . tony stark is an industrialist or engineer who comes up with a suit for combat ?
21683,robert downey jr does a great job at playing tony stark
21684,"he gets paid so much ! such a life change for s guy that went to prison for drug problem . the other cast members in the movie are great , too ."
21685,i love almost all the marvel movies !
21686,"i have n't seen the recent ones . i 'm not big on superhero films , though i did like the deadpool film a it was a shame that stan lee died ."
21687,"yeah , stan lee was awesome ! he 's an animal !"
21688,he always ended his phone conversations with the word excelsior ! not the why though . i guess it sounds cool . do you follow got ?
21689,no i have never watched it
21690,game of thrones is an hbo serie based on a novel by g . r . r . martin . this year i sure finland season . huge following !
21691,thet 's cool it 's filmed in ireland . always wanted to go there
21692,it costs like a million an episode . one of charlie chaplin 's descendants is in the series . would you name your laughter arya ?
21693,i like the name . . . but would dog name my daughter a trendy name
21694,"i would name my daughter honor , in honor of the giant who says only his name ."
21695,lol . . . ummm ok ! there 's also a descendant of charles dickens
21696,"yes , i wonder how many descendants sickness has . might quite a large number . ; half of london , maybe ."
21697,it 's crazy howmany countries they 've filmed in
21698,i think it 's part of the charm soft he sequel . the writers must have a lot of fun choosing interesting nackdrops .
21699,"yeah of course , and good for the actors that get to go to all those countries !"
21700,tourism goes up in t countries where th filming is done . i would think that governments would do what they could to attract got episodes .
21701,tru 3 ! funny how theres a shows bout lions using te got characters
21702,"i think national geographic is trying to milk the trend . i doubt people watch it fort hat , though ."
21703,di you happen to see the first iron man movie ?
21704,had ! i did and thoroughly nejiyed it ! what about you ? i did n't know until after seeing it they the executive producer was ralph from a christmas story !
21705,hi ! i did and thoroughly enjoyed it ! what about you ? i did n't know until after seeing it that the executive producer was ralph from a christmas story !
21706,"was it really ? it 's amazing i turned out as good as it did , then . i bet it was chaotic ! i think it 's also crazy the guy who voiced jarvis still has n't seen any of the iron man films . it 's like why ? ha !"
21707,yes it ? s why it 's so energetic . i would have been terrified . i didn ' know that either . i often wonder why some actors do n't watch their films .
21708,"it must be an ihnsecurity or something . i 'd still want to watch and support myself ! even if i only got paid a million for the first movie like robert downey he . did , even though eh made 10 million for the sequel , ."
21709,i would be too curious about how it turned out . apparently it was totally work it for downey to do the first three since he got such a crazy pay boost for the second . i also feel that he revita.ized his career .
21710,agreed . and e did so with a movie ethan is based on a character with lee rested only because he figured no one would like him . now he 's probably the most famous comic book character today ! ha !
21711,i agree . do you also enjoy are of thrones ? i love that show .
21712,"i do . actually ! so much so , if i ever have a daughter , i would n't mind naming t arya . ha ! it 's also the fastest rising new for girls in america !"
21713,i 'm not surprised . i talked a friend put of doing that because i knew it would happen . do you remember the character viserys targaryen ?
21714,"yes i do ! is n't he also a descended of charles dickens ? guess that explains howe e got famous , right ? ha !"
21715,he is he is the greatgreatgreat grandson of dickens . he the sam vote do you know who the actress that played robe stark 's wife talisa is related to ?
21716,i heard it was charlie chaplin . did they require you to be a relative of a legend during th casting process or something ? ha ! i suppose it makes it so much easier to be picked knowing you hae chaplin or dickens ' blood in you !
21717,a ha i guess so because yes she is the granddaughter o chaplin .
21718,got you ! so have you ever watched the nat geo show game of lions ? it basically showcase the lives of differnt lions as if they 're actual game of thrones characters . it 's very interesting and entertaining .
21719,"ha ha , no . i had no idea that existed . it does sound interesting . did you know that game of thrones is largely filmed in ireland ?"
21720,"i did and also heard the tourism there finances it . taht is crazy ! i mentioned lions earlier and speaking of lions , they say animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they 're domesticated . i wonder if that applies to lions as well ?"
21721,good question . i wonder if it 's just that one animal that has to be domesticated or the whole species ?
21722,"it 's definitely worth looking into , i suppose ! but being there are roughly on quintillion animals on the planet , that would be a lot of white patches . ha !"
21723,wow ! that 's a larger number than i can wrap my head around .
21724,"hello , do you like the superhero movies ?"
21725,"some of the , yes i do !"
21726,have you seen ironman ?
21727,i have seen the first one i think . is that the one where he has the thing in his chest and flies around ? haha
21728,"yes , that is th first one . dp you know who produced it ?"
21729,"from what i reall , that was a great ; . good movie ! i 'll rematch it , because . remember that i enjoyed it a lot ! that film grossed 585 million on a 140 million budget to prove it !"
21730,yeah marvel for sure made a lot of money off that movie . do you have an interest in animal s ?
21731,yes i do ! quite a lot of interest actually ! what about you ?
21732,"yes me too . do you know how , any animals are in the world , individual ?"
21733,i did n't but had to find out ! it 's 20 quintillion animals on this earth ! that 's crazy ! the number bro my brain ! lol
21734,"i do not even know how many zeroes are in thatn number , to be honest"
21735,"same ! i 'm horrific at math ! lol so , i just found out that in 2002 germany became the first country in the world to give nonhuman animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rights ! know , we should do the same ! that 's good to hear that any country did that ! we ahve a lot of animal abuse adn neglect issues that might be addressed if we did so ."
21736,thay is very true and it is sad so maybe we can remain hopeful since there are governments in other countries who are doing something about t
21737,"ernest hacked whoo divided the animal kingdom into 2 classes , animalia and protocol , also happened to make some of my most favorite artwork ever ! you should heck out the animals diagrams that he created ! they are so good !"
21738,"wow , i will do that . so you have a pet ?"
21739,"i sure do ! : , do you ? i have cats , dogs and ish ! but iv ' e had a huge amount of ' animal friends ' throughout my life ! a lso i 'd love to get chickens if i had the space , s o start i could raise them for eggs . i aspire to be a kind of farmer . that i do live with a bunch o plants wand animals . lol"
21740,"yeah , i have a dog and i heard that the develop white patches on the forehead if they are domesticated but i have not seen it in my dog"
21741,"interesting ! yeah i have a black dog and i guess i 'm going to be checking her head for white patches later on to test taht theory ! : ,"
21742,yeah . do you know why we still have hiccups ?
21743,no . why ?
21744,an overall of the time when we had both gills and lungs
21745,"oh wow ! t hat 's so cool ! i 'm really into science stuff , k i 'm going to look into that ! hard to believe atl nice has been around on earth for over 650 mi , lion years ! such an amazing thing to think about ! it 's been a real pleasure chatting with you ! say hello , to your dog for me ! : ,"
21746,"same here , thanks for a great chat : ,"
21747,hey . you watch the olympics ? how cool are the skeleton helmets !
21748,"hey , i watched some of the olympics . those skeleton helmets are very wool"
21749,yeah kind of like a mix between game o thrones and dracula !
21750,for sur end o you like the movie iron man ?
21751,yes i love that movie . tony stark plays iron an so well !
21752,"he is a very good actor . did you know downey r . only made 500 thousand for iron man , b u trade 10 millie nor iron man 2 ?"
21753,"wow what a hug contrast , well deserving though he is the name behind the success ! stan lee created iron man because he thought no one would like him !"
21754,stan lee is awesome . stinks that he passed away recently . he lived a long good life .
21755,yeah he was a mastermind behind all the comics . did you know the first ironman movie was filmed without a script ?
21756,oh wow that 's amazing . only stark ' raptors are revealing the entire movie plot in a language called 3rd in the beginning of iron man .
21757,so cool . i also really like animals . there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on earth !
21758,that 's a ton of animals ! ther eis a lawyer in switzerland who represents animals in court .
21759,power to the animals ! germany also protects them as they were the first country to universally give animals constitutional rights !
21760,that 's hilarious ! there 's a jellyfish that can live forever .
21761,wow . blessing and a curse is suppose . i hate getting the hiccups but apparently its from early evolution of having both gills and lungs .
21762,"i agree . that 's funny , i did n't know that about hiccups ."
21763,yeah . there are also cool animals on tv like in game of thrones or in other words a song of fire and ice .
21764,animals have a dominant paw like humans ; .
21765,oh i wonder if most are right paw dominant like us ? there is actually a show on na geo about lions and they are portrayed as game of thrones characters !
21766,i one as well . that would be cool to see that show . what a good idea .
21767,yes . got is actually financed by ireland to increase tourism !
21768,have you seen ther blacc panther ? i wanted to see it but never got around to it .
21769,nope . i have n't . . i heard it was great . i think i time out in 2018 .
21770,it tunes out the black panther in the richest superhero .
21771,"dang , i figured bruce wayne would have taken that spout . marvel comics made a good profit too . ."
21772,"black panther is at 500 billion apparently , nad bruce wayne 80 billion . not sur exactly how that is calculated ."
21773,i heard michael b jordan did and creat job acting as the black panther .
21774,and chadwick boseman could ' afford to go to a prestigious summer theater program . he got funding through a private benefactor who actually was denzel washington .
21775,denzel i awesome . . i was sad that stan lee a creator of the comics had died last year . whose your favorite character ?
21776,"i actually am not really into superheroes . i guess i woudl say sup3ramn , because i used o like to watch the , oi and clark : the new adventures of superman wen i was a kid . how abou thou ?"
21777,i actually like blue ear because of the story behind the character .
21778,"hmm , i have n't heard of that kind . i find it interesting that marvel offered all their characters to sony for 25 million and that offer was rejected in 1998 ."
21779,they probably lost a lot of revenue . blue ear was cheated because a 4 year old was uncomfortable wearing hearing aides .
21780,"that 's an interesting story . yes , i am sure they lost a lot of money since all sorts og superheroes are extremely po0pulsrt there days ."
21781,i guess you could look up the reviews on rotten tomatoes to find the good superhero movies .
21782,"yes , rotten tomatoes is a good resource . i just learned it is owned by warner bros ."
21783,they seem to own everything . michel bars movies have an average rating of 38 percent .
21784,i ca n't believe that spykids got a 93 percent rating on rotten tomatoes . i didnt ' feel it was that good .
21785,id o n't like spy kids it all . i thought it was too hockey .
21786,"yeah , it definitely was n't fun for m . it has a better rating than the dark knihg5 prizes , for instance , which is surprising ."
21787,netflex has 150 movies available with a 100 percent rating . it seems netflix is the way to go .
21788,i do subscribe ton netflix but i find i run out of stuff to watch .
21789,"hi , how are you ? i like movies ! do you ? ?"
21790,"hi ! i do love movies as well ! in fact , i loved black panther and do screen with the fresh eating on rotten tomatoes as wel las the 100 percent rating it got on the first 50 reviews !"
21791,"i aint seed the black panther film yet , but i know hat it got nominated for a prize or something ."
21792,"david ehrlich from indie wire said it 's the first superhero movie that ' flows with a genuine sense of cultural identity , memory and musically ' and he coylncd't be more accurate !"
21793,i guess i shold ought o see it then . it sounds really cod . is it based on a comic or soemthing ?
21794,it is based on the marvel comics character of the same name . but back panther himself actually made his debut in captain america : civil war in 2014 !
21795,"i dint see that one either a there are alot of superheros out there and a bunch of films with them . have ? is that the batman , and the super ?"
21796,"i honestly do n't know . but i do know , surprisingly enough , but black panther is actually hoe richest superhero with an estimated networth of 500 billion . that 's more than bruce wayne are tony stark combined ! that is crazy , is n't it ?"
21797,i guess any thing is possible in rye superhero universe . i could be rich f i were a superhero .
21798,"so true ! speaking of money , marvel actually offered she cinematic rights of nearly all f its characters to sony for 25 million but they would only purchase spiderman 's rights for 10 million thinking movie enders would only like i i boy , was tha ta mistake neon sony 's part !"
21799,"boy , thee were dumb . 25 billion ? that aint hardly nothing for sony ."
21800,"agreed ! i think it 's also crazy that disney doesn ' 6 own the rights to the characters like spiderman n , xmen , avengers , etc . in theme parks on he east side of the mississippi river because of a contract tey signed wth universal studios back in the 1990s !"
21801,that is a odd level scrambled over those characters . i think that it would be better to buy them all and not have the confusion .
21802,"agreed . speaking of legal scrambled , more , was successful in their court agumnets that mutants were n't people and thus , were able to pay lower rates on xmen toys instead of higher rates nor the dolls simply becase they 're not technically human . i thought that was funny !"
21803,"i agree . totally . funny ! it 's a good idea t be human in the us , but not if you 're a doll . i see now how i should proceeds if i get a species change in the future ."
21804,"ha ! no kidding ! since we 're on the subject . comic book characters and movies , are you familiar with rotten tomatoes ? i never knew until recently that they were owned by warner bros ."
21805,"i use rotten tomatoes for many things . they got rid of the best part of it though . now is just got regular movies on the . still , its good enough ."
21806,agreed . i think it 's sad that michael bay 's average movie rating on rotten tomatoes is an abysmal 38 percent . that 's bad for such a big one director .
21807,he i good with the specials affects and such lie . he knows how to blow up things . do ! 38 percent
21808,"ha ! so true ! and then , n o video game based movie hands received a rating over 4 7percent on the site either . that 's sad as well ."
21809,that sounds wrong . those movies have a loyal fan base . if figure somehting must be good in there .
21810,"so true ! and i thought it was surprising spy kids received a highes rating than both the dark knight rises an lincoln . spy kids got a 40 percent . now that is unbelievable to me . ha ! well , it was nice chatting with you today . we care , friend !"
21811,"hello , have you ever seent lack panther ?"
21812,"no i have n't , but from eberything a 've seen i think i should . have you ?"
21813,"yeah , its a great movie ! kinda slow at first then it pick it . did you kno black panther is the wealthiests upper hero ?"
21814,"no , i did n't . but i 'm really curious stop know more about the technology and economics off wakanda ."
21815,"yeah its really advanced , they even have a sort of healing bed , that would be super amazing if we did that ."
21816,"i 'm really interested in postscarcity themes in science fiction , so i need to watch it for sure ."
21817,"its on netflix right now , you should before they take it off lol"
21818,absolutely . it 's the next on my list .
21819,have you watched any of the other marvel movies ?
21820,i 'm not normally much of a comics or superhero person . have you ?
21821,yeah i think i have watched all of them lol did you know there is one character that both marvel and dc own ?
21822,i did n't . but i wish there as less intellectual property over characters and it was easier to mix them up in fanatic .
21823,yeah . i guess . i hear marvel created a super hero called blue ear for a 4 year old boy who didnt want to wear hearing aid s .
21824,that 's cool . i like the idea of regular people seeing themselves more in comics .
21825,yeah . do you know michael bay ? his average rotten tomatoes film rating is 38 percent ?
21826,"no , i 've never heard of him to b honest ."
21827,he is the director of most of the transformer movie .
21828,i do n't think i 've seen any of those .
21829,ok cool .
21830,have you watched any of them ?
21831,yeah almost all of them .
21832,cool ! nice chatting with you .
21833,have you watched infinity war ?
21834,i have not seen avengers ' infinity wa met have you ?
21835,"i have n't either . some fans were ma tthat hawkeye was forgotten in the trailer . i 'm not really sure who hawkeye is , honestly ."
21836,"i am not sure either lol , but he is a part of the films since 2011 's thor . i guess i would wonder too !"
21837,fans even started a petition on change . org saying hat hes should appear in future infinity war promotional materials . haha .
21838,"really ? that ? s awesome ahha ! i guess they are saying they did n't put hawkeye in teh trailer because h eas a special sport in this film , so it makes people speculate what he will be doing in the infinity war film ."
21839,fans also felt though that in previous movies hawkeye has not been given justice .
21840,"true , i hear that too . i can ' saw because i havent seen the movie . but i do enjoy the marvel comic films ."
21841,"yeah , i lke the marvel comics series that they have on netflix ."
21842,"yes ! and i found it interesting that the marvel films are distributed by walt disney pictures , but it makes sense !"
21843,interesting ! they do not ave the rights to show big marvel characters in theme parks in certain areas though .
21844,"that 's interesting ! the movie industry is confusing lo . . . . i love walt disney pictures though and i guess it makes sense they share the marvel comic movies , i suppose there are contracts ."
21845,it 's funny also that there is one character owned by both marvel and dc name access whose only purpose is to keep both companies ' universes separate
21846,ho strange lol ! about as strange ass michael jackson trying to buy marvel comics so he could play spider man !
21847,"hah , i had never heard that . speaking of selling rights , marvel offered cinematic rights corn early all characters to sony for 25 million in 1998 . they rejected the offer and only purchased spiderman 's rights for 10 million thinking that nobody really cared about teh other characters ."
21848,"oh no ! hahaha ! that was a huge mistake by sony , whoa , i would be sick lol ."
21849,i know right ? my kids love them . they have some of the dolls . marvel argued in court hat they were mutants and not ; people in order to pay lower rates on toys .
21850,"really ? haha , no were if that worked ! marvel comic toys are expensive ."
21851,not sure but it just increases the profit margin for the company haha .
21852,true ! ia m going to have to watch this infinity has movie now lol l curious about the hawkeye character 's although he has been in there are films .
21853,"yeah , i heard it was good . i will have to check it out ."
21854,did you watch infinity wars ?
21855,no . i heard that i was the first film ever shot in digital i x .
21856,interesting . i have not watched it either . i wonder what it caused an increase in shawarma sales .
21857,i do n't even know waht a shawarma is . i suspect it was known in an attractive way in the film .
21858,i believe some kind of sandwich in it bread . it ' w amazing that the voice actor who played jarvis in the iron man series and avengers has n't actually seen the films
21859,it sure is ! marvel has sure made a mint out of their group of characters .
21860,do you like to read marvel comics ?
21861,"yes . at least i have . i originally started with dc comics but the marvel characters seemed more nuance . they realy got some of league actors in that infinity film including robert downey , . and josh brolin ."
21862,shave you heard of blu ear ? this superhero was created for a four year old boy who wa uncomfortable wearing hearing aids . te boy told gigs mom that superheroes do n't wear hearing aids so marvel create one .
21863,tht is neat ! how about ' the lion king ' bowing dubbed into zulu for its african release ' ? that is also neat .
21864,that is cool . i like that frozen was the first animated disney film directed by a woman . it sure ws successful .
21865,"they used to have to draw animation frames by hand , so they also reused some in movies in the 70s ."
21866,"yeah , i can imagine . drawing by han requires a lot of effort ."
21867,"yes . that undoubtedly aide each frame costly . disney is one of the big six film makers , and of course they do things that are not animals ."
21868,"yes , they own marvel right ?"
21869,no . marvel forced all of ther hero rights to borrow money to build their own production company . it became successful ot merriam lynch would have owned the rights .
21870,"hmm , interesting . did you know there is one character owed by bout marvel and dc named access ? hi purpose i stop keep bout companies ' universes separate . i have to look into that ."
21871,i hav not heard of the character . the name doesn ot mark 'the superpower obvious either . marvel did not start using the name marvel until 1961 . they were atlas comics before that .
21872,so sony rejected a deal to purchase all of the rights to marvel characters for 25 million . they only bought spiderman for 10 million thinking that audiences would only care about him .
21873,there have been a lot of such offers that were not accepted then looked like bargains in hindsight . i guess you were right about disney acquiring marvel entertainment . sorry fo the misinformation .
21874,"that 's okay . yes , i guess they acquired marvel in 2009 ."
21875,good morning . . . . don '' t knit anything about avengers or infinity war . . . . but i 'll try mlb est on it . your views ?
21876,"good morning , i saw the movie , and thought it was pretty good . it contains alot of different superheroes that have to work together and try to stop the bad gut thanos from getting all the infinity stones . having ll of then allows him to instantly kill off billions of people on earth . spoiler alert : he gets the stones and some of the people killed are even some of the most beloved superheroes ."
21877,"wow ! wait a sec . . . . i did see on of those avengers movies . , ca n't remember which one , . but , i liked the robot only jr . character , ca n't remember his name , but , simple minds ; ' do n't you , forget about me , ' is a pretty awful song ."
21878,"i agree with you about the song ! all i think is a molly ringwald 80s movie . wel , anyway waht 's so funny about robert downey jr . is that eh hid food while he was on the set and the crew could never find the food heh id , so they just kept letting him do it . some of the scenes in the movie are some of the food he hid ."
21879,"lol . . . was robert downey 's character called ' flash ' or something ? i ca n't remember , bee years since i saw it . too many of these movies have flooded the marker with so many characters , i ca n't keep up . i 'd never download a enemy jenner app though . dont need all the ads that probably he with it ."
21880,"robert downey jr . is one stark aka ironman . and i have too many apps already , i could n't download another m , if i wanted to !"
21881,"lol . . . thanks for the info . man , i do n't even remember that character name , but i love he first movie it him . perhaps i should seek out more of those movies , good escape entertainment ."
21882,"the little kid that lives next doo rio me loves the flash , though . i see him in his costume zooming around din their yard all the time . i funny ! have you ever watched disney 's big hero 6 ?"
21883,"nah . ; . . have n't seen it . i 'm 61 years od and those movies like the new avengers : infinity war rely on your knowledge on the characters to truly follow along with the plots . heck , i ca n't believe this is already the 19th film fro marvel comics ."
21884,"hey , you 're never too old . i 'm a grandparents myself ! lol i did see big hero 6 with my grandsons and it 's a good little cartoon movie . fantastic graphics it was made using a 55 , 000 core supercomputer ."
21885,"that ; s probably the reason why i do n't get caught up in those movies . i do n't have any children , let alone grandchildren , i bet they keep you up on what 's going on with these marvel comics films . i was n't even music of a comic book reader when i was a young man ."
21886,"yes , they do that ! do you remember watching disney 's , ' the jungle book ' ?"
21887,"now , the 're talking more my speed . . . lol . yes , i liked the jungle book as well as more of the wal disney pictures ."
21888,"well , i only found out recently thati the four cultures towards the end of the movie that sing were based on the beatles . is n't that funny ?"
21889,"wow ! the beatles . my alltime favorite band . it 's been years since i saw the jungle book , but sort of remember that land of the movie . i 'm gon na have to watch that wal disney picture again . . . put a smile on my face ."
21890,"yes , it is a classic for sure and i too love the beatles . have you ever seen the pixar move , ' hp ' ?"
21891,'ve never even heard of it . what 's it about ?
21892,"it 's a children 's cartoon once , it 's kind of sad , to me . it 's about a little old amen that ties balloons to hid house to float it to him and his dead wife 's favorite place . i always wondered how many balloons it would take o lift a house , if that 's even possible . you hear of people ; e strappimn gtheirselves in lawnchairs with balloons tier to it , but a house , i bet that would take manly balloons to lift that ?"
21893,"lol . . . . i hear ya , i have n't given that much thought . but , just that you said reminded sew the i loved the dark disney pictures as compared with the marvel films . the disney pictures always pulled sat your heart strings an were more sentimental than the boomcrash action films . that 's perhaps why i loved them ."
21894,"that is so true , disney is a master a tthat !"
21895,"you 're great to chat with , glad you controlled this one . knew very little about marvel comics port he newer films . have a great day , and the to run across you again in these chats ."
21896,hi . do you like movies ? ;
21897,"hello ther , i do , i love movies . how about yourself ?"
21898,i do . i am a big disney fan . i even like the movies in the 70s despite them recycling a lot of animated frames .
21899,yeah i love movies from the 70 's and especially the 80 's . disney made a ton of good movies in the 80 's and 90 's .
21900,hats about the air that they started working on wreckitralph . that 's a really long time .
21901,"wow , that is a long time to make a mcvie . i dont think most people realize how long some of those animated movies take to make ."
21902,i would think a year . do you like the marvel movies ?
21903,"i think they are ok , but i have not seen too many of them . how about you ?"
21904,i have seen a lot of them . i like thee avengers . do you know any characters or actors from that movie franchise ?
21905,"not really no , but i do know the character strom the xmen series , i grew up watching those cartoons ."
21906,"i just learned that marvel paid less for xmen toys because they are not hyuamn , thee are mutants . how interesting ."
21907,"wow , i 'm sure there was a court battle and a lot of money spent over that missed ."
21908,did you know disney owns amr4vel ?
21909,"i did not know that , but that kid a smart move . they can release as many superhero movies as theyd it then ."
21910,what is really interesting is that they do not own them eat of the mississippi due to a contract with universal studios
21911,really ? that is very interesting . id you know they created a superhero who was deaf and needed gearing aid ?
21912,i did not know that . i also didn ot know that there is one character taht is owner by dc and marvel whose sole purpose is to keep the companies universes separate . i wonder what character it is . do you know ?
21913,"really , no i dont know . but i wonder why they would do that and what marble thought when dc started tha character ."
21914,they ate both worth so much money . there must be a legal reason for it . sony could have purchased them all for 25 million 20 years go but decided not to .
21915,"yeah thinkk about that decision not being made , and like blockbuster buying netflix , crazy how some things pay off and some things do n't ."
21916,"it was nice chatting with you , i , earned a lot o one things ."
21917,"yeah same here , i hope you have a good day ."
21918,hello . do you use google much ? a single google search is so powerful !
21919,"i love google , it is the 1 search engine , how about you"
21920,yes i love it too . i mention that it was a powerful search engine . a single search requires more computing power than it took to send neil armstrong to the moon .
21921,that is so crazy o think ow far technology has come . i click enter in google and i have more power han that !
21922,it really ahs come along way . google maps even tracks traffic by tracking how fast android devices are loving .
21923,"wow lol , that is awesome . did you hear about their headquarters ?"
21924,ar yoy referring to the fact that they have n't goats mow their lawn instead o people lol ?
21925,"right , you think they would help the economy more and hire a lawn crew or something lol"
21926,yes good point . hey have so much traffic on theirs 18th . in 2013 pole went down for about five minutes an took 40 percent of web traffic with it .
21927,"wow , i bet that is true ! w hat do you think of their self driving cars ?"
21928,i think they are ascianting and likely the future . nevada thinks so too because they 're the first state to allow self driving cars .
21929,"wow , i think it is scary allow wait o dive for me , but i think it will be th future of cars i 'm opinion"
21930,resist will free up a lot of time i hope . mercedesbenz creative self driving car in the 80s . i thought it was more of a recent thing .
21931,"wow , i never new that . i am one of the 75 percent of people who are scared of self driving cars , are you ?"
21932,that is a lot of people . i think i am in the minority and i am not scared by them . i am more excited b them .
21933,"taht is awsome , i think that number will change more and more they become popular . it will be like cell phones probably , you need to have one eventually"
21934,yeah i am definitely working forward to getting ones in the future . it would cost be like living in a video game . speaking of video games they used to be called cathode ray tube amusement devices .
21935,"video games sounds such better , lol ! i love video games !"
21936,"no doubt abou tthat i do too . a lot of people do actually , as a planet we play 3 billion hours of video games a week . well i really enjoyed this chat ."
21937,"i enjoyed this chat as well , time to go play cathode rays uber amusement devices ! enjoy your day !"
21938,haha awesome ! bye !
21939,do you use google a lot
21940,yes a lot . do you now howe us a single search takes in terms of power ?
21941,yes mode than in took to take armstrong and 11 others to the moon
21942,yes . do you know how they calculate traffic ?
21943,yes they take the average of devices as they more around
21944,yes . do you know how they mow the lawn ?
21945,"once hey hired goats to eat the grass , pretty cool"
21946,yeah i know wb did uo is of that time google went down for 5 minutes ?
21947,ye sand took down 40 percent of the web with it
21948,yeah that just speaks volumes on how powerful and used it is
21949,yeah . what do you think of selfdriving cars ?
21950,they are cool . nevada is the first state to allow wthe
21951,yeah . do you know which game they are using to advance them '
21952,yes they are using grand theft auto r
21953,yeah . do you know who was the first person to have an unlocked iphones ?
21954,that was george hot who built a self driving car in his garage
21955,yeah . mercedes created self driving cars in the 80s
21956,yes and they went 1200 miles at 100m ph successfully
21957,yeah that project was called the prometheus project
21958,yeah . did you know that many people are afraid of self driving cars ?
21959,yes more than 3 or 4 of people . nice chatting with you
21960,is google your prior search engine ?
21961,"it is , i just love using google searches are accurate and fast , i also like yahoo searches , what about you ? do you like use google much ?"
21962,i like how google specializes in internet related services and products . they have so much computer power behind a single research that they use more womp ; outing power than it took to send msn to the moon
21963,"wow i guess that is a lot of power , i use the google maps a lot so thats another thing that i got to thank google about"
21964,"i like ow google in general doest h extra mile . for instance , for countries that dispute borders , google tailors the map according to each country 's claims"
21965,"that seems like a lot of work , i wonder how their servers handle that amount of info and have you heard about the selfdriving car google has ?"
21966,"i find self driving sr capable of seeing its environment andre espondun gindependetnly of human intervention is a very interesting concept and it has come a long way . while it may be helpful for hating alike parking where most factors re static , i find that it will find it hard to compensate for erratic human behavior on the road ."
21967,"you know that about 5 percent of americans are scared of them i think i belong tp that group , i know they an be helpful in many ways but stil , what to my car gets hacked ? what if the robot gets confused ?"
21968,i think if every single car on the rad was self driven and hooked into a central system that would be safer than the current emerging situation
21969,"could be , i just hope the tech is completely solid before we risk all those self driving cars getting o the streets , do you know who george holes is ?"
21970,i only say this because human error is a singer treat to program that have strict guidelines . then agains s you say there may be a bug that leads to arcades of failures the lead to disaster . who is george holes
21971,"yeah i see your point , human error is a big threat indeed and george most is the first person to ever unlock and iphone , well he built a self driving car in his garage isnt that amazing ? i bet that was the product of years of hard work"
21972,it is . the potential benefits of this technology rangers from increased mobility to increased safety to say the least .
21973,you know the game grand theft auto 5 ks actually being used to improve the a of self srivign cars
21974,really ? are video game seeing used to test ai ?
21975,"yeah apparently they are , you know video games were used to have a super long and weird name"
21976,ah you mean when trey were called cathode ray amusement devices by the military ? ya that is a mouthful
21977,"yeah cathode ay amusement devices , its a lot grand boring name for sure lo , l , i wonder why its illegal to play video games past midnight if your 16 in south korea"
21978,"it probably because too many kiss can be addicted to games so to encourage kids to use computers an game less , they have such a rule"
21979,"i think its a great rule , that lame rule should be applied in america lol , its crazy how many hours of video games are played . a week , if you add all the hours the numbers are just too big"
21980,"i do find that it a practical solution . however , given that many south korean kids are studying till late , time constraints my be a thing . i any case , this chat was a pleasure . i hope you have a wonderful evening ."
21981,transportation seems to be the focus there days . autonomous cars are taking over . nevada was the 1st state to get board an tallow selfdriving cars .
21982,would you trust a self driving cars ?
21983,"hmmm . thats a good question . i know the benefits are huge . . . increased traffic flow , better mobility for these who do n't drive like children and elderly . . . they ' e makings strides everyday ."
21984,it scares the heck out of me . ; . machines ca n't be trusted wth our lifes likd that . . . plus the joy of driving is something i 'm not willing to give up . . .
21985,and 5 percent of americans feel the way you do . mercedezbenz built as selfdriving day in the 80 's . this was called the prometheus project .
21986,"good for mercedes , but based what i know about taht technology is still flawed . . . based on white lanes on the road and sensors around the vehicle . . . what if it snows ? or it 's so cold that sensors will go crazy ? no no no . . . sorry ; , there is no way i 'm getting into car liked that ; ,"
21987,"actually , selfdriving cars improve safety . advanced control systems with high tech sensors welp to safely operate 'the car without the factor o human judgement errors . sounds good to me ."
21988,ok how yes a car know to change the lane ? i mean how does th car knows it 's in the lane and when it will be in the right lane after changing lanes ?
21989,"technology is amazing . just like w behave technology such as ps that knows how to guide us , selfdriving technology is mindblowing ."
21990,gps is different . the worst that might happen is you get lost . . . but with all driving technology ? you can die . . . it 's way too dangerous . . .
21991,"when k think of all the drivers who get into accidents b making unsafe lane changes , not detective objects in blind arenas and so forth , i feel hat robots are much better at rejecting these things ."
21992,"that 's a valid point but once a person is making that mistake it 's his own and his own responsibility and the punishment will be just for that man . who will the responsibility for a fault batch of cars ? and another thing , do n't you feel like w ware giving our freedom little piece by piece ? they want to control us . . . how fast we drive , they ant to know there we are al the time . . . what if thy wil take control of yours ar against your will . . . it 's just a scary concept for me . . ."
21993,udnrrstandedly ! ! people have the same thoughts as related to cell phones and alexa and others . self driving cars also help to keep others safe . . . by making sure that you share the road safely with others .
21994,"i do share th road safely with others . . . if somebody is not , he or the should be sent to redo their driving license . . . there is too many factors to thrus ta machine . . . last year tesla car killed a woman on a bicycle because the sensors didn ' 6 work as they should . . . i mean the pardon inside of the car was fine and safe buy lab biker was killed . . ."
21995,"i agree that should not have happened . that 's why technology continues to advance to make them safer . may people kill others everyday . . . on bi , . . . . . motorcycles . . . pedestrians . . far more than are killed buys self driving cars ."
21996,"here is my point . . . this scares me because it starts innocent like this gret , safe technology of the future . . . sure . but what i 'm afraid of is that in 50 years , man wo n't have a choice and will have to use that technology . . . i want freedom . i love freedom , and i hope w will naive bot hsdlfd driving cars for people who needs it , and regular cars for people that love driving . . ."
21997,"i think that whether or not to drive a selfdriving vehicle will remain a choice . 75 percent of americans are uncomfortable as you yourself are . he battle is on , nonetheless , uber and mayo are both fighting for the winning spot in transportation ."

22005,it 's pretty cool stan lee would end every phone call with ' excelsior '
22006,haha yeah that is cool . he created so much hp marvel even published a generic comic book to trademark superhero nd supervillain !
22007,"pretty smart idea to trademark ' superhero ' and ' supervillain ' , i wonder how marvel et 's paid for it"
22008,agreed they make a ton of money now . they get out dc for sure . dc comics stand for detective comics by the way .
22009,"lol , de6rctige comics comics , it is really redundant"
22010,very ! the marvel cinematic universe takes place on earth but in a different multiverse .
22011,yea marvel demoted the cinematic rivers eas earth199999 in their canon
22012,"interesting . to you like marvel films ? i loved black panther , ryan coogler did a good job directing !"
22013,"yea black pnathee was graet , chadwick boseman did a great job as t'challa"
22014,agreed . the symbols and written script are abused on an actual scripts called nsibdi .
22015,that 's pretty cool black panther incorporated nsibdi series in the film
22016,leah very cool . the characters name was briefly changed to black leopard in order to not associate i with the party name black panther .
22017,i never knew marvel 's black panther came out before the black panther part
22018,yeah i did n't know that either . i also love the movie deadpool and i saw both teh first and second . in 2004 reynold dead the comic and though he was destined for the role !
22019,well the deadpool comic described himself ad ryan reynold crossed with a sharply
22020,yeah that explains it . the voice of the mystery villain in deadpool 2 is actually ryan reynolds 2
22021,that 's pretty cool . did you know the deadpool video game cost more to make than the movie ?
22022,how is that even possible ! ! apparently deadpool 2 is the 11th installment of the xmen film series .
22023,"neat . well i have to go , nice chatting with you"
22024,have you heard about the puerto rico strong anthology of comics ?
22025,"never before this is my first time , have you ?"
22026,yes da ll the profits go to united way of puerto rico . it has a lot of stories about puerto rico history .
22027,sounds interestin doesnt ' it ? specially given the great writers behind he comic . and it 's a great cause ad well . have you seen th black panther films before ?
22028,"have n't seen it , bu there good things from hte critics . i know it came out this year nad was made by marvel ."
22029,"yes correct , ive seen the first but have yet to see the second . given their intentions and the great writers d you believe it will have an impact on the public 's perception o puerto rico and its history ?"
22030,i think it might . especially after the hurricane that hit were . they had a lot of economic problems before it hit .
22031,"yeah , i hope so too . given that they till seem to be struggling from the hurricane to his day . it 's interesting how they are implementing comics for this . its interesting how popular thy became in the us and uk even though htey originated in japan ."
22032,"yeah , it was a great movie or them . and the cover art nwas noti franquez . she did a good job ."
22033,"yeah , for sure . hopefully the general public hears bout the history behind the jones act and the struggle the island has had economically , specially for tshirt own point of view ."
22034,yes . one of the cocreator had worked on deadpool . it 's good they got such amazing people to do it .
22035,"hopefully an impact is made . i cant believe how deadpool became one of the highest grossing rrated films of all times , i knew it would be as but not this big ."
22036,"wow . caught people by surprise . there was a lot of diversity in the puerto rico strong project , and a lot of diversity in deadpool 2 ."
22037,"yes , did n't know about that before this . i find interesting how super hero movies like these can implement actual cultural artifacts like the writings on the script that originally originated from nigeria . it 's just amazing , hopefully thrid new comic book also has interesting facts like these as well as serves riots intended cause ."
22038,"'s . it 's good to learn about cultures . msu , mich strat u , ha 'the largest available comic collection in the entire world that is available to the public ."
22039,yep . how so many offered to answer the call for such a project speaks a lot about the puerto rican people likd eschwartz mentioned .
22040,yeah . they really wanted to do it . for puerto rico . it was thanks also to lion force . they were the publisher for the comic .
22041,"yeah not only the people but these organizations like lion forget who will match the first 25 , 000 and diamond comic distributes also donating 5 percent . retail sales to united way of puerto rico ."
22042,yes . comic books really do mean a lot to people . it 's interesting that dc stands for detective comics .
22043,"oh yeah , i was thinking the same . never crossed my mind to even think about waht dc stands for . i just hope that all their intentions become reality and the people of puerto rico at the end of the day benefit from this . it was nice speaking with you about an interestin topic like this ."
22044,yes . thank you for the conversation o this topic . i was intriguing .
22045,hey there waht do you think about puerto rico ? you thin kit should become a state ;
22046,i 'm on the fence . i see good points and bad points . i 'm more concerned with the devastating the destruction they 've had from hurricane maria .
22047,yeah it sounds like it was relaly bad over there . i guess hey started a comic book about puerto rico to help raise money
22048,"ye , i heard that too . t 's called puerto rico strong . i ca n't remember who the donations go to though , do you ?"
22049,ye the go to the united way of puerto rico . i think that 's a good cause . and also the donations will be matched by other
22050,"yeah , that was it . i 'm not a big comic book fan , but this is such a great cause . i like h ow they are involving so many puerto rican comic book writers and they write about any topic to bring awareness to puerto rico ."
22051,yeah i agree . definitely a good cause . would yiu read comic books outside of the puerto rico comic thought ? i only watch comic book movies myself
22052,"no , not really my thing , but the i was growing up , m y dad had a co ; election from his younger years that he would pull out from time to time and we 'd read through them . they have changed so much over the years . they 've been around in the us since 1933 ."
22053,"yeah that 's impressive . that 's definitely a lot time , it said stan lee passed away , i love tat he would end his phone conversations with the word ' excelsior '"
22054,that 's funny ! there are so many fun facts ! like msu has the largest comic book collection in their library .
22055,yeah i did n't know that . i actually have friends that went there and i never even heard that they had a comic book collection . do you like marvel or dc comics more by the way ?
22056,i like marvel . have you seen black panther ? it was based on the marvel comics .
22057,"see black panther . i was shocked to learn that he is actually the richest superhero , even more wealthy than tony stark who is iron man"
22058,really ? ! i did n't realize that the character black father predated the founding of the black panther party .
22059,"i did n't know that either . i also did n't know that the symbols used in the movie where based on real written symbols from the 4th century , that is impressive"
22060,that 's pretty cool . . . i wonder how many movies have been made based o marvel comics . do you know of any more ?
22061,"yes there 's iron man , captain america , and they 're coming out with captain marvel soon . personally it in there are too many marvel movies coming out though ll"
22062,"lol . . . yeah , my son likes them , but not me . i think deadpool was another one . also , another one i did n't see . lol"
22063,"oh deadpool 's actually really good ! i like knowing star the main character in black panther gave thanks to denzel washington , because denzel lent him money back in the beginning of his career"

22099,"that was based on a book , so the plot was tight . i think the breakthru was the technology . later , the stories were weak ."
22100,"yep i agree with you . also one thing that 's cool about the first movie , is that it took 6 hours to render jist one frame of the time is that movie . i wonder what it takes now ."
22101,"it was a stunning achievement in computer graphics . spielberg had planned to use models , but the graphic were the best ! he raptors were humans , though ."

22118,i saw that too kind of cool taht lane elephant roar was the primary sound used for the trey roar in the movie
22119,its hard to believe the film only cost 63 millions to make
22120,even though it was called jurrasic park the dinosaurs from the movie were almost all from the fretaeous period
22121,he i guesses jurrasic just sounded better then
22122,yeah i guess so i think sounds a lot better tha n ' cretaceous par k ' haha

22140,o wow . cornell students must pass swimming trust to graduate !
22141,"that is interesting ! i know that where i live you are also required to pass a swimming test in school , what is interesting too is that when people say that you can freestyle swim everyone just does the style called the fronts crawl because it is the most efficient"

22158,nope i have n't herd of him . that is he known for ?

22160,"wow that is crazy ! federer is like one of the best too , i think it 's funny that polo shirts were actually invented by a tennis player and not polo players"
22161,"yeah he 's al legend , imagine getting beat like a rookie in that way , and that is funny then game of the player was rene lacoste , wonder if he has anything to do with the lacoste brand ."
22162,"hah a he does , he invented the polo and was actually a tennis player which is cool , i wear polos al 'the time what about you ?"
22163,"i do as well and it never crossed my mind a tennis player invented them , i wonder how much weight tennis players lose in a match ? i know hockey players lose abut 8 , maybe its a similar physical effort"
22164,"ya that is a good point , tennis is very tiring i knot i sweat a lot and definitely lose weight when i play , do you play any sports ?"
22165,"i like to swim , i think its a great sport , works all the muscles in the body , what about you ;"
22166,"well i do like to swim , i have n't swam in a long time though , i 've heard that it burns a ton o calories because the water is cold and your body has to work hard to keep you warm too"
22167,"yeah it does , its one of the most complete esports actually and you know the sun is the leading country in swimming olympic gold medals"
22168,"nope i did n't know that , i do think i'ts weird that hockey rinks and basketball courts can switch spots easily , thats ho wthe do . at sports stadiums"
22169,"yeah , talk about taking advantage of a court lol , its good they use that space for other sport sweden hockey ws no ton season n ,"
22170,"ya that is a good use of space , crazy that canada scored 132 goals in the first olympic games , i wonder why they are so good at hockey"
22171,"maybe because its own of its national sports , a lot of people interested in playing and a lot of support towards players"
22172,"that 's true , i want to be the guy that was traded for 1 only to win 4 stanley , y cups later on the ne dream , his fist team must feel really dumb for trading hime aha"
22173,th especialy olympics were born in 1968

22178,they have been helping out for 30 years !
22179,"its sad how 70 percent tofu americans with disabilities seek employment but only a third of them find one , there should be more inclusion ."
22180,at least bank of america is helping out . they have more than 300 individual with disabilities on the support team .
22181,"yeah they do contribute a lot and help a lot of disabled people , they provide work that has to do with warehousing , print services and others ."
22182,even 100 of the employees are athletes in the special olympics .
22183,"really that is sk cool , i heard erin wrigley is one of them and was tyler kennedy , both won medals apt the special olympic games ."
22184,nearly 350k people wit disabilities entered the workforce in 2016 !
22185,"i think its a good step , but more improvements need to be done , i think more businesses should follow the example of bank of america then a real difference even be made ."
22186,do you know who to swim ?
22187,"i like swimming , not sure i understand your question but i do like it ,"
22188,i meant how ! oops . i ma slow swimmer . i would like go try that baned suit .

22190,it won 94 percent off all area in the 2008 olympics . more than michael phelps has golds roger countries !

22201,"ok a here is a type of competitive swimming where the athlete has their hands and legs bound , and swims like dolphin ."
22202,that sounds like drowning to me ! i like that cornell university makes students pass a basic swim test . imagine being best i class and then failing because you ca n't swim .
22203,so only america screw more god medals in swimming compared to the rest of the world . .
22204,"like i said my kids swim , when we go to everest here are so many kids doing it there must be millions in america . the coach says other countries do n't take it a seriously ."

22210,those pucks look dangerous flying around . i understand that most other countries understand hockey to mean field hockey . i guess it depends don if your country is cold or not .
22211,"canada is the only country in the world with two national sports , lacrosse an dice hockey ."
22212,"i guess they ca n't decide . just like 'the arenas that acre both hocky and basketball , i was n't aware they had the basketball court on top of the ice ."
22213,"ice hockey is very interesting , but they are playing very aggressive"
22214,"i guess they sweat a pot , they can lose eight pounds in a game ."
22215,"sure , they want to run throughout the game ."
22216,"i have to get he kids up , have a good day ."
22217,did you know that there is a type of competitive swimming where the athlete swims with their hands and legs bound like a dolphin ?

22225,"wow , i did n't know that i thought i nwas only hockey ! well , my favorite team is the us olympic team i think ! apparently it ' a a really fit sport , too because players lose about 8 pounds per game !"
22226,"yes , this is why they eat so many carbs before games . i hear players ' favourite meal is chicken harm . have you ever been to a hockey game ?"
22227,"no i have n't been bu maybe i have seen an ice hockey ring without realizing , since apparently they keep teh ice hockey courts under basketball courts which i have beet o !"
22228,i 've seen both and hte speed at which the ice i covered is pretty cool . the world junior are starting soon so i 'm sure you 'll be watching the us team !
22229,"yes i think i will ! i also enjoy tennis , do you ?"
22230,"i did meh more when i was younger , but i do n't really have time to follow foo many sports . but i find out recently that polo shirts were first designed for tennis players andc ot for polo players as moms people rethink !"
22231,taht 's funny ! u ever though of those shirts as sports shirts at all since these days you see preppy people wear them a lot . i think tennis is so interesting because games can eve run as long as eleven hours !
22232,"i do n't know if i would be able to watch a game or 11th ours , i get too into games so it would drain me ."
22233,well luckily that game actually was stretched out over the days so you could et some rest in between
22234,that 's true . what 's your favorite sport ?
22235,"i think my favorite sport ties probably gymnastics or lacrosse , which like we talked about before is one of canada 's national sports . how about you ?"
22236,oh i relaly like gymnastics . always watch the during these bummer olympics . but my favourite sport is definitely hockey ha ! i really like the we have talked about sports so much .
22237,me too ! thanks and merry christmas !
22238,do you enjoy movies ?
22239,not as much as i use to . u . s . movies tend to be strong on special effect and weak on acting . i do like a good scifi tha ties well acted d .
22240,i enjoy how scifi films incorporate fictional science based depiction of phenomena that boggles peoples minds .
22241,"i agree , but not somethng so farfetched its unbelievable . i like the science to be futuristic , but realistic enough to appear attainable . i also like scifi based on books , like hunger games ."
22242,how about mores serious films like a space odyssey ?
22243,"space odyssey is based on a short story titled ' the centineo ' . so , it has a place on my favorites lists . how about scifi books ? 2018 had some winners ."
22244,"i tend to watch scifi movies more . did you know that scifi films have become even more popular in star wars and nasa even has a list of accurate pace term , s to help writers write scifi stories ?"
22245,"considering the imaginary concepts , e . g . star trek transporter , , i think it is good that nasa emphasize real definition for actual terms and concepts . what i find interesting is that some scifi actors may no longer be regular actors but still have high earning at conventions signing autographs , etc ."
22246,"well that explains why fan conventions are tremendously lucrative for actors , m align 100k plus in one weekend"
22247,"i wonder if the nasa list has a definition for ' hyperloop ' ? as of late , i have not heard much abou felon musk 's hyperloop tunnel in social . do you think it will work ?"
22248,elon musk has founded many innovative companies and the hyperlo0op tunnel was such a type of plan he would have . i have father been hearing more about his aerospace company spacex
22249,"spacex id definitely a leader in private space transportation and exploration . it also highlights elon 's weird , and expensive , sense o humor . did yu know he short a cheers wheel into space as a tribute so monty python 's cheese shop sketch ?"
22250,"i guess he has interest in i , improv and acting . h eleven produced and acted . thank you for smoking ."
22251,it also seems like the acting bug bit his wife as well . ; she made an appearance in the ' inception ' movie . a you interested in being one of the first to join elon 's first transport to colonize mars ?
22252,"the first perhaps , but i think it would musc rather go to mars after everything is proven to work"
22253,"so true , the first traveler will be true explorers , going in knowing thay success , if it occurs , wi , l life a hard fought struggle . but , then perhaps they cna ask the alien commander from herd rock from the sun for survival this . . . lol"
22254,"the knows ? maybe they will teach elon musk shot o build da vertical take off supersonic , electric passenger jet thati e so desires to build"
22255,"he does have a vivid imagination and deep enough pockets to dream tha fb . but , some of his antics are humorous . in a way they remind me of a old british comedy cgi fi tv serie s ' red dwarf ' ."
22256,i enjoy the red dwarf too . i enjoy comedy in general since it encourages laughed and focuses on humor .
22257,"agreed . i have a reading list on my ereader . balancing over it , i see i ma weak ins if . so , i am thinking of adding home new releases . have you read any writers or reviews for ' sophia of silicon valley ' ?"
22258,"i recently heard that that it offers a surprising inside 's look , also succeeding as a rain chef , in any case , i ill also consider reading this book . thank you for your time chatting today"
22259,i like th sway the author has rubbed shoulders with steve jobs and elon musk . she probably got good insights from people accustomed to ' pushing the boundaries ? .
22260,indeed . another reason i will check out th ebook
22261,have you ever watched deadpool ?
22262,"oh , yeah , i 've seen them both ! really enjoyed them , although some of the ' out wall ' breaks got a lkttelk over the top in she second one . . . still , l to of fun !"
22263,"it 's the highest grossing rrated film of all time . i have n't wathc it yet . looks scary ,"
22264,hmm . . . weird . . coudl have sworn passion of the christ was the highest grossing r rated i . . . but maybe not . .
22265,is it an rrated film ?
22266,"passion ? yes , it is . , it was very controversial for being rather graphically violent . , som argued gratuitously so . , you know , speaking o deadpool , crazily enough the video game cost more to make than th movie !"
22267,that is crazy .
22268,"yeah , a lot of money goes into the development of video games these days . in many ways they 're bigger businesses tha movies !"
22269,"yes , true . it use to be just toys based upon movies . now the video games have a life of their own . ?"
22270,"oh , speaking of superheros . . did you kno even garfield was a superhero for awhile ?"
22271,i use to watch garfield but did n't know that .
22272,"i im n't either , one i used to read the books when i was younger . they had a book series spinoff called pet force which had him as his friends as superheros . . ."
22273,i 've read that too .
22274,"speaking of superheros and all that . . did you know that stan lee , rip , wrote 15 dc comics ? i never knew he 'd ever written for dc . . ."
22275,i do n't know stan are . who is that ?
22276,"he 's the guy who created the xmen , fantastic four , spiderman , and one is the original writers of marvel com , is . he also had a cameo in all the marvel movies ."
22277,wow
22278,"but yeah , he was a big star in the comic book or superhero world . and speaking of stars , do you know there are stats that are cold enough to be touch by the human and ? weird to think about when you consider our sun is a star . . ."
22279,i 've read that . do you think earth ws ever a star ?
22280,"i got to doubts , but dunno enough about it to say ford sure . i 've heard somewhere that it was once a lot smaller and got hit by a large asteroid which upped its mass a whole bunch . . ."
22281,maybe i will look into that . i was nice batting with you . have a great afternoon .
22282,"good morning , have you seen deadpool 2 ?"
22283,"actually , i have n't . i ' v been meaning to , but i am watching the mcu n order , and have n't made it to his does yet . ironically , the deadpool video game was more expensive to make that the movies ."
22284,"i have n't seen it either , but i was to . i saw deadpool described himself far bryan reynolds creed with a sharply ."
22285,that was what dead rio reynold thinking he was getting the role . nothing like literally having it drawn out for you .
22286,agreed lol . the voice of the mystery villain is actually ryan reynolds .
22287,have you read any of the garfield pet force comics ?
22288,i have not . are they any god ?
22289,thee are cute . garfield and his friends are superheroes .
22290,oh very cool . i would like to read tha then . i saw there is a comic series about fixing collateral damage recreated by superheroes .
22291,i have n't heard of that one . have eyou heard of normalman ?
22292,i have not heard of normalman . who is that ?
22293,he is the only person on a plnwaet without super powers .
22294,very cool . what super powers does he have ?
22295,"well , as he is the only one without and , he has none ."
22296,ahh ok i just saw he did n't have powers . that would be lonely then lol .
22297,"i doubt it , he has plenty of company . ther years over 30 superheroes registered in the us ; i 'm sure hes friends with many ."
22298,wow that 's a lot . do you know much about the universe ?
22299,"not too much , other than there ie theory regarding 'the universe being one what hologram ."
22300,i have heard that too . there is a theory that the universe only ha one electron .
22301,i guess there are some stars that are col enough to be touched .
22302,"definitely . well , it was food chattin with you . take care ."
22303,hey did you see the movie deadpool 2 ?
22304,"yes , i did q i loved both deadpool movies ! i think it is hilarious in 2004 that deadpool described himself as a mass between ryan reynolds nad a sharply !"
22305,"haha ya i 'm so glad teh got him in the role , i was happy hat both are rated r and not pg13"
22306,"yes , the most surprising part by far of hte first movie was how inappropriate it ws . i loved that !"
22307,"lol yup i agree , i like it much more han the avengers movies"
22308,me too . you know a movie . going to be good when both james cameron and david fischer read the script and champion th project .
22309,"you 're right about that theyre both great directors , do you know who did the mystery villain voice at the end of deadpool 2 bt w ?"
22310,i do actually ! it was ryan reynolds !
22311,haha yes ! did you play the deadpool game btw ? its actually really good and cost more to make than teh first movie !
22312,"i have not played it , maybe i should check it out . that is shocking considering deadpool is the highest grossing r rated movie not directed by george lucas or james cameron n !"
22313,haha it iss shocking q what other superheroes do you like ? apparently there are 300 that are registered in the usa white is a lot to choose from
22314,i wasa m a huge fan of all the batman movies l i would have loved to see garfield a wa superhero . there was a spinoff of garfield named pet force which featured a gang of superheros along with garfield .
22315,haha ya that sound cool to me ! did you know stan lee actually made some comics for dc ? im shocked he always did stuff only with marvel
22316,that is really cool i was very saddened to hear that stan lee passed away a few weeks ago . he was a pioneer .
22317,"ya i agree i miss him , i want to read the comic abou 'the the collateral damage that i caused by superheroes that sounds interesting"
22318,"that does sounds interesting . i am more interested to learn about normalman , the only person on a planet of superheros without plowed ."
22319,"lol i would read tha too , what do you think about our universe though , do we live in a big hologram ?"
22320,it is so deep to even contemplate . some say that only one electron exists in the universe . mind boggling stuff !
22321,"yes i agree ! i don ' know how that works , or how a star could eb so cold that you could touch it !"
22322,"some scientists think that , like earth , universes ar subject to naturals selection and darwinism . puts a whole new spit on things !"
22323,"wow yes it does ! i also wish we could explore outerspace more , there is apparently a part of outer space tha is pulling on our current galaxy"
22324,hi how are you ? what do you think of this universe of ours ?
22325,i think the universe is very fascinating ! what about you ?
22326,i love learning about science . i think it is interesting to hear all the theories of the universe .
22327,i great . have you heard about the theory with the universe and natural selection
22328,i guess it makes sense ? better universes with better laws and constant mud be more robust ?
22329,"yes , it is crazy o stink that universes evolve through natural selection much like different species do on earth . i have never thought about it like that ."
22330,i wonder how our universe is doing . is it going to be around for another billion years ? lets he so .
22331,i hope so too ! have you heard that the universe may be one giant superhologram ?
22332,"if so , then are we just tiny holograms ? am i chatting with a hologram ?"
22333,i hope not ! that is freaky to think about .
22334,"we could all just be illusion . seem god drama , and we are part of the hologram ."
22335,that is crazy . ave you heard about cold stars ?
22336,i have not . could stars ? i thought stars were hot .
22337,i did too . bu apparently there are stars in the known universe that are cold tough to be touched by the human hand .
22338,i guess that could be interesting . i would rather mars . or the moon .
22339,i would love to touch a star !
22340,i think that stars are fascinating . many people do not know that our sun is star .
22341,i know . i feel like you earn that in middle school though .
22342,"were , they should kno that , but some people see though most of school . anyway , great chat ."

22351,"me too . especially since i have my kindle app i it , with all y books . right now i 'm reading the oracle year by charles some . have you heard of him ? he worked on daredevil adn death of wolverine e ."
22352,no . but i have heard those titles before .
22353,"i 'm so into scifi . i love that it depicts phenomena that is not fully accepted by the mainstream , it still uses scientific plausibility and plot logic ."
22354,i like sci fi films . i always look for new sci fi movies or series
22355,any in particular you like ? 2 2001 : as pace odyssey is still my fav .

22368,yes i thought so too
22369,"it 's been nice chatting with you , but i 'd better get back tow york ."
22370,you too
22371,"let me know how you liken he new scifi stuff you check out , thouhg ."
22372,hi there are you as far wars fan ?
22373,i ma ! are you ? have you seem the young han solo movie ?
22374,i have been it . actually watched on netflix recently . i liked it 12
22375,nic e ! i have not seen it yet . i was just reading a review on it actually .
22376,it 's worth checking out . the combined box office revenues from all the star wars films hasve brought in over 8 ; 5 billion dollars !
22377,that is a lot of money ! did you know that with century box agreed to forgo a 500k directing fee to let lucas keep the licensing and merchandise rights ?
22378,i wonder how they feel about tht now . lucas pulled one over a them . the entire franchise is estimated to be 65 billion dollars !
22379,i know ! it has cost hem billions and made lucas himself a bill ; onair .
22380,"chaching ! his wife marcia , won an academy award for editing the first movie !"
22381,that she did . george ever did not win for directing .
22382,rights ! james atl jones only spent 2 . 5 hours recording all of the lines for darth vader 's voice fo they first movie .
22383,"yup , and he was paid 7500 for it . not a for 2 . 5 hours worth of work !"
22384,not lol shabby . lol did you know hat han solo was a tie fighter pilot prior to rioting thye millennia falcon ?
22385,i did n't now that actually . did you know he was an imperial lieutenant before his friendship with chewy ?
22386,i did now that ! you did n't see the movie yet so i wo n't want to spoil how he became one . lol
22387,lol ! i appreciate tha tc
22388,lol christopher walked was considered by george lucas or the part of ha solo i nthe original movie . he might have been pretty good in that role .
22389,probably would . al pacino turned it down because he could not understand the script .
22390,do you know any facts bout planets you would like to share ?
22391,if jupiter 's moon ganymede orbited the sun it would be considered a planet !
22392,now hay 's interesting ! i had a good time chatting with you !
22393,i did too !
22394,good evening . did you see the new solo star wars movie ? i thought i was great !
22395,i thought it was okay . . . i 'm curious to see what the original directors were doing witht he product before they got fired for ' creative differences ' .
22396,"yeah me too . i just love star wars in general . , i especially loved the first one in released in 1977 !"
22397,"yeah , it was a huge part of my childhood growing up ! they say the whole franchise ties worth like 65 billion snow"
22398,i believe it . apparently george lucas ' wife had some input on the films .
22399,"yeah , i heard that ! many have stated that it was her editing and ike puts that really saved the first film . she even won an award for editing the first movie . they maybe should have brought her in for the prequels !"
22400,wo yeah she deserves all of that . for wars was the first major film dubbed in native american . t really is popular in all cultures .
22401,"like him or not , you cotta admit lucas 's business smarts . he forced a 500k fee on a wars to keep the merchandising , ie for , rights . that move made him a billionaire , cause , what kid did n't want those toys in the 80s ?"
22402,wow interesting . yeah a major powerhouse mj does earl jones was only paid 7000 for voicing adder ! eh missed out !
22403,"speaking of star wars , could you imagine bill murray in the role of solo ? they say h auditioned for it !"
22404,haha no way . i 'm glad he did n't get it . al pacino also auditioned nad turner down the role .
22405,"dunno if it 's true , bu i heard somewhere nick note also audition . that might have been kin of funny . . . esp since he always has one scene in every film where he gets all exaggerated with everything . . . lol"
22406,haha hilarious so true . add christopher alien to the list as well as he was considered !
22407,i area in an early draft tht han solo was supposed 5o married to a rookie . the he ? ! or
22408,"haha that would have made things interesting . i like the star wars world but i also think our planetary system is interesting . venus for example , doe now have any seasons !"
22409,"i did not know that ! yeah , the space is really interesting . did you know you could gift every other planet between earth and the moon ? as douglas adams once said , ' space is big , really big ! '"
22410,whoa very smart words . jupiter 's cool would be considered a planet if only it bribed the sun !
22411,"speaking of jupiter r , do you now it would be impossible to have manned space stations in it 's orbit because of all the radiation the planet emits ?"
22412,oh that sounds very cvancerous . interesting . uranus does n't though and it actually rolls around the sun .
22413,"speaking aoc rotating , there 's a planet that orbits four different stars . cotta google that sometime . ."
22414,wow i def need to look that up . but i also need to stay away from the planet that precipitates shards of glass . well it was lovely talking with you i hope you have a great evening . goodnight !
22415,have you seen the young han solo movie ? it i agreat !
22416,"yes , i thought so too . i just read something that said the robot was the best part . i do n't agree ."
22417,nah i really like alex palying han solo he 's young and handsome
22418,he did a good job . i thought the cinematography was excellent too . i don ' g understand how it got such a bad review .
22419,ia m not sure i loved chewbacca as well equate a grea character !
22420,yeah . maybe people expected a total star wars duplicate . it 's its own movie . it paid have a george lucas feel to it . . .
22421,without a doubt it is w new story . tey had radford young doing cinematography i that to be good right ?
22422,"yep . i was surprised to learn that james cameron was a truck driver that , after seeing star wars , deceit o get into the film industry ."
22423,that is pretty crazy . all of the first 8 movies in the series were nominated for academy awards that is amazing for a bunch od equals
22424,yes it is . george lucas said that the whole star wars saga is told by r2d2 about 100 years after the return of the jedi . i did n't know that !
22425,i had never heard that either ! what a great idea ! the series holds the guinness world record for the most successful film merchandising franchise . they have sold a ton !
22426,"so many things have been produced for star wars . did you ever see the same , y guy versions ? so funny . . ."
22427,i have not that is pretty unique . i think its funny that al pacino could hav been han solo but he turned hte role down
22428,also bil murray auditioned fdr the part . i just ca n't see anyone but h . ford now .
22429,for sure though if george lucas had made han solo a large green alien maybe so
22430,or a rookie . in the original star wars i guess he was secretly married to one .
22431,he was secretly married to a rookie ? really ? was chewbacca jealous ?
22432,"i hope not . i would hate to see him agency . i loved firefly , there is suppose to be az gory ana solo in every episode . i totally missed that ."
22433,i hav never noticed a toy . i wonder what solar systems hey were in ? it seemed to have a lot more than our own 8 or 9
22434,do n't know . apparently there is a planet that orbits 4 stars . that must be one weird orbit .
22435,that would be a very weird orbit i wonder if i stilts o that seasons ?
22436,do you like star war ?
22437,of course . who does n't ?
22438,what did you think of solo : a star wars story ?
22439,"while i am a fan of the franchise , i heard that it failed to gross more than 6million"
22440,"yeh , and it only had one third the size of its normal audience during opening weekend ."
22441,"while i do n't think the quantity of people of who hatch a movie during the opening weekends is any accurate indicator , i have heard mix reviews of the moon"
22442,som people think it 's a bad omen for the star wars franchise and the rest of bllywoo because it tell abut consumer 's moviegoing behavior .
22443,"true . the a major release is having subdue al ow turnout , it usually means the worth of mouth and interest is lacking ."
22444,the big drop on the second weekend also tells a lot .
22445,indeed . it is especially troubling when there were no other major releases since at that problem its a you problem
22446,"yes , this ratio has been very accurate in predicting the overall box office of the spring and summer period ."
22447,do you think there us a emerging trend of less people interested in seeing films immediately after they are released in movie theaters ?
22448,i thin also . is netlfix to blame ? i know i 'm not interested in going to the movies anymore !
22449,i do n't know . personally i do enjoy going to watch movies in theaters k but i do n't feel an need to go as soon as it is released .
22450,"then again , what about the success of black panther and avengers affinity war ?"
22451,perhaps marvel it just doing better than star wars
22452,they made star box office year up seven percent ? it 's a similar end for the tear before but by august things had craters out nad the box office was down .
22453,"currently , the sar wars franchise is worth 65 billion . i wonder how those recent releases will affect the star wars franchise"
22454,it 's the fifth highest grossing media franchise . i would have thought a would be higher o that list
22455,i mean george lucas became a billionaire off the merchandising rights a ; song for the original star wars
22456,he has his wife to thank for some of the little details in the original star wars film . she got the academy ward for editing the film .
22457,hello do you lke or watch movies ?
22458,even i can . i prefer to watch tv series though . how about you ?
22459,i like both . it you know disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping baby was a failure ?
22460,i did n't know it was a failure in the box office sine i love edit a sa little kid . disney does n't always make the best voices though . its treasure planet was the most expensive box office flop of al time .
22461,"ouch , that sucks . although , i never watched it . what disney movies do you ike ?"
22462,"i like all of the animate ones , hah . i guess tom hanks does ot know about box office failure . he is the highest earning box office star of all time ."
22463,"good for him . he is a great actor , i cant even think of a movie he is in that sucked lol"
22464,it 's difficult to predict thet wil flop and what wo n't though . 20th century fox was convinced that star wars was going to flop . george lucas said that he would work a 500k directing fee so he could keep licensing and merchandising rights . he decision cost fox billions
22465,"since valentines day is coming up , i heard silence of the lambs came out on v day in 1991 and made 270 mil at the box office hahaha that doest seem like a valentines day movie ."
22466,"no it does not , haha , though , i woudl n't min watching a superhero movie like avengers infinity war . it 's the first film to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras ."
22467,"that was a great movie , the second one is coming out soon ! you should watch the otters to catch up lol"
22468,"yeah , that sounds like a fun valentine 's day actually . the avengers caused an increase in shawarma sales . did they eat shawarma . the movie ?"
22469,"hahaha tony stark says it at the end of moon of the avengers movies that he wants to eat shawarma after ah huge battles , i think they show him eating shawarma a few times after that"
22470,interesting . i remember watching the original hulk when i was little . the actor who played the hulk in that here has been voicing the character or decades .
22471,"yeah probably the only wy he gets work , i havent seen him in anything else ."
22472,"speaking of voice work , the voice actor who played jarvis is the iron man series vhs never actually seen th films ."
22473,yeah thats pretty funny . hue has a good voice .
22474,threw waitress tha captain america saves in the avengers was also the voice of gretchen i recess
22475,"i actually dont know that show recess , and i dont think i know that actress , iss he good ?"
22476,i am not really sure . interesting how there is a lot of overlap in voice work and acting though .
22477,"its been fun talking to you , have a good one , bye ."
22478,were eyou aware that solo : a star wars story did not do well at the box offic e ?
22479,"i know because hte movie barely made 29 m , billions ."
22480,well it made that on it 's second weekend . unfortunately that was a 65 percent pummel fro the week before . those numbers are horrible for af in of that caliber .
22481,wear do you think star wars franchise would think about ?
22482,i believe that the may have over saturated the market with a new movie every year . i also think that not tat many people want to see han solo portrayed y anyone that is not harrison ford .
22483,do you know that usually above 60 perfect mans the opposite ?
22484,yes apparently a slip of 60 percent between weeks one and to is not good . his is specially bad here since it went up against no other blockbusters . but a slip of less than 50 percent on the second week is considered good so 65 percent is quite bad .
22485,there is too much to know about hollywood . do you know that a box office is also a ticket price ?
22486,no i was not aware of that . the box office for the year was up 7 percent was is good for the business . a quiet place was a sleeper hit and i quite enjoyed that movie .
22487,"good . it is also fascinating how a movie can be a lot in home counties can be a broke box office . for example john cast was not good at all for disney . , but in russia was a broke box office ."
22488,yes i am always surprised about what a movie does internationally . it seems to me that many action movie that womb here and their money back overseas .
22489,true . star wars has been for awhile . we talking about back kin the 70 's . i am not a fan . i am impressed in has been . so long and fans are cray about it .
22490,i does't have any nostalgia for theme myself because i didnt ' watch them repeatedly as a child so i went ol like teh new ones more which i know is blasphemy in the fan community .
22491,"hahahaah ! fox must have been so disappointed when they accepted george proposition to forgo an additional 500 directing fee , thinking that th movie was going to flop"
22492,"oh no . tht was a ad choice on his par do although i am positive he has made more than enough money . kind of off of the subject , were you aware that tom hanks is the highest alltime box office star at 8 . 5 billion worldwide in film earnings ?"
22493,did n't know that . it is so incredible how actor sand actress can make so much money just for a movie . i still can believe that jrr wars in 2008 made 65 billions off collars .
22494,"yes it is a very lucrative industry . i was hour teachers and fire fighters could make more money but i suppose there is not as much money in it . i was surprised to learn that james earl jones only made 7 , 500 for voicing darth vader 's lines for star wars . his voice is so iconic ."
22495,they should be . you have to study harder to be a teacher and you dont get paid enough for it . at least james stil made some money . but it is most incredible that tha actor who played in iron man series and avengers has n't seen the film s .
22496,that is shocking . some people have a hard time watching themselves so i hope that 's teh only reason .
22497,hahahaha . . it is so hilarious to know that roger downey used to hide food mn hte sets . it has to be hard to be a doctor .
22498,wow ! that seem unnecessary with craft services .
22499,do you like the star wars series ?
22500,"good afternoon . yes , i do like star wars . ho about you ?"
22501,"i liked the first three films . the ones after that , not so much . i 'm amazed at al pacino turned down the role of han solo because he coudl n't understand the script ."
22502,"not the great al pacino ? i 'm glad he turned it down , i ca n't picture him being hans solo 41"
22503,george lucas originally intended solo to be either a large green alien or a black man . i figure sam jackson would have been good for that .
22504,"yes , h e would have . he would have put his extra special spin oh it for sure . i ad heard taht christopher taken had been considered by george lucas as han in the original star wars and i ca n't picture him , either ."
22505,"walked is a bit too dark . maybe something imperial for hiim ? then gain , han soo was a imperial lieutenant before is companionship with chewbacca ."
22506,i did n't know that ! i still find it hard to believe that 20th century fox thought star wars would flop .
22507,lucas had done a tremendous film before star wars . i do n't know why they thought a sci fi film would do badly . maybe they did n't understand he story .
22508,"well , that was a big mistake on their part , but it made him a billionaire ."
22509,"licensing and merchandising rights for 500k ll was knew that he toys and tshirts would se , l ."
22510,"you know , i still have my original star wars lunchbox and heros from when i was a good . it 's in pretty rough shape , but i would never part with it !"
22511,"too many memories . too much nostalgia . james earl jones spent only 2 . 5 hours recording all of darth vader 's lines for star wars and was paid 7 , 500 . i wonder how much he made on residuals ."
22512,"i hope more than 7500 , that seems like a low amount for such an icon of the f5nachise . everybody knows darth vader 's voice !"
22513,"in 2013 , star wars was dubbed in navajo , making it the first major film to be dubbed in a native american language . i wonder if he had anything to do with that ."
22514,"idk , i wonder if james earl jones was anything to do with that , as well ?"
22515,could be . maybe he earned to pronounce navajo . he has such a distinct voice .
22516,"he wonder if george ever goto ad because his ex wife , marcia won an academy award for start ars and he did n't ? that 's kind of funny ;"
22517,"i guess that cool be a source of tension over the years . he really never got recognition from the academy , but i guess he 'll have to make do with billions ."
22518,"i 'm sure he 's crying all the way to the bank , as well . but , i 'm sure they ot her share of that too !"
22519,"i gues wo . anyway , great chat !"
22520,great chanting with you as well . good diy !
22521,hi how are you today ?
22522,"good , do you like to read ?"
22523,yes i you . have you ever read macbeth ?
22524,"no , but i have heard that jon euro just wrote a version of macbeth set 1bn 70s in northern england ."
22525,"his ' macbeth ' takes place in 1970s northern england , where a drug lord named heat , a standing for the three witches , defies both police chief duncan and inspector macbeth ."
22526,do you like shakespeare ?
22527,yes a little bit . he is often called england 's national last and the ' bard of avon ' .
22528,"he is a great dramatist taht jhn , funded a lot of people , like joe ness ."
22529,pocahontas and shakespeare were alive at hte same tire and died only a year apart . thats kinda amazing if you think about it .
22530,"to think he invented the names of miranda , jessica and olivia , he was good at giving dances ."
22531,yes that a cool fact also . do you like being out in the sun ?
22532,"yes , i do like the sun , i like the heat , especially i winter ."
22533,i love sunfloaers and summer so much .
22534,but it is surprising that a lightening bolt is hotter than the sun .
22535,yes but i toes th sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy
22536,"one universe is s big , e own in our solar system , neptune just completed its first orbit around the sun since 1846 , the year of its discovery ."
22537,"yes i read that its diameter i about 1 . 39 million kilometers , ore 09 times that of earth , and its mass is about 330 , 000 times that of earth the sun is . so cool ."
22538,also it is so massive that thee energy created from its reaction take between 10 000 and 170 000 the get to its surface .
22539,wow its bee nice talking to you . thanks .
22540,"you do , what do you think about jane justine ? mark twain did not like her ."
22541,yes i like what i read . talk to ya later ?
22542,nintendo is over 100 years old . did you know it had been a playing card company ?
22543,"hi , no 8 did n't kno what ! i love nintendo"
22544,they produced a lego knockoff when they were a toy company
22545,cool ! theres a long history behind the system
22546,nintendo even owns the seattle mariners and a 3ds app lets you order food right from your seat
22547,oh wow ! that is awesome ! you know they could lose 250 million bucks every year and would n't run out of money until 2022 !
22548,wow ! do you follow tennis ? they used a helicopter to dry he grass tennis courts for hte 1969 us open
22549,cool ! i love tennis ! until 1979 a tennis player coudl use navy item as a racket ! how strange !
22550,that is very strange e ! the longest tennis match was 11 hours over 3 days .
22551,"whoa , that takes endurance e ! soccer makes more moeny than tennis , football , basketball , golf combined !"
22552,polo shirts were invented by raven ' the crocodile ' lacoste and then only later adopted by polo players
22553,interesting ! i did not know that . some believe that grunting before a shot in tennis is considered cheating ! hahaa
22554,could be distracting i guess . the universe may be a giant superhologram . what sound strange .
22555,cool ! i love the universe it is such a mystery ! it once was completely opaque !
22556,one theory says there is only one electron in the universe . that is strange
22557,really ? ? ? i wond how that could be possible ! weird . . . . . they think the universe may exist inside a black hole . . . kinda scary !
22558,there is a region of space that may be pulling galaxies outside what we can observe
22559,seriously ! that is interesting . ;
22560,new detailed were released on super smash bros . ultimate for switch and it includes every single playable character in the franchise 's 19 year history
22561,"wow , that i cool ! if you could old a piece of paper in half 103 times . . . . it would be as thick as the observable universe . . . strange ! ! !"
22562,how is that ? a character name waluigi is a bizarre version of lii . that 's strange . ahve a good one !
22563,the sun is quite fascinating . how n't you agree ?
22564,"absolutely . it is a hot star at th center of the solar system , after all ."
22565,it i do did you know it is actually kite an only appears yellow ?
22566,"oh , is that because of the atmosphere ?"
22567,yes it is a eyou atmospheric scattering . i was so surprised to learn that a lightning bolt is actually hotter than the sun . it makes me wonder how anyone has survived a lightening strike .
22568,top . on july 11 2011 there was a full orbit of the sun when neptune completed its first rotation since it was discovered .
22569,"wow ! i knew it was far it there but i did not realize it 's big to that long . shockingly , the sun is only 1 billionth the size of teh biggest star discovered in our galaxy . i ca n't imagine th score of the largest ,"
22570,the sun is 2 . 39 million kilometers still . so it 's rather big .
22571,that 's huge . so the larges star discovered in our galaxy s 1 billion times larger than that ! i cant wrap my brain around that size .
22572,indeed . i wonder if william shakespeare wrote about the sun . he was very famous .
22573,his work holds up too . did you know that he coined many of the phrases we use today such sas ; ' good riddance . in my heart of hearts . laughing stock . wildgoose chase . devil incarnate . brave new for . as luck would have it . all our yesterday . break the ice . lull circle . '
22574,"ah . he invented miranda , jessica , and olivia as on 's names also ."
22575,i was not aware of that . i like all of those names . 8 find it very shocking that pocahontas and shakespear were alive at the same time and died only a year apart .
22576,that 's intriguing . jane austin was very famous too
22577,yes sue was and is . i am much less familiar with her works . i know that she wrote emma and thati clueless was based on that book .
22578,yes . three novels she ha written were rejected when they were sent o major publishing companies under a different name in 2007 .
22579,wow ! i 'm sure they felt stupid later . i was not aware that mark twin hated pride nd prejudice . it 's arguably as famous as any of his classics .
22580,yeah . they both ike to use the word literally as hyperbole .
22581,candw e all really hate it when people do that now ha ha .
22582,ye a it 's interesting they pioneered a lot of what i some now .
22583,they certainly did .
22584,"hello , how are you ? did you know shakespeare coined or popularized , any of the phrases we use say . some of the include : ' g food iddacne . in my heart of hearts . laughing stock . wildgoose chase . devil incarnate . brave new world . as luck would ave it . all our yesterday . beta the ice . full circle e . '"
22585,"no , i did n't . but i did now taht he and pocahontas died only one ear apart"
22586,"yeah thats interesting . this one is kinda weird : polish composer andre tchaikowsky donated his skull to the royal shakespeare company in hopes that it would be used as a prop for the skull of yorick . and 2008 , the skull was used in a series of performances of hamlet at the courtyard theatre , stratforduponavon ."
22587,"that is weird . however it 's pretty cool that shakespeare invented the names olivia , jessica , and miranda ."
22588,yeah i had no idea . those are vey popular names too !
22589,"yes , without him , they would n't be there . switching topics , di dog know the sun is actually white ? we see it as yellow because of the atmospheric scattering ."
22590,"yes i did . very interesting . a lightening bolt is hotter than the surface od the sun , about 5x hotter . thats crazy ."
22591,"thins disc crazy . something else that is crazy is that hte sun produces enough energy to power for entire planet for 500 , 000 years in just one second ."
22592,"yeah , a lot of people in a area awe converting to solar panels !"
22593,"i woul debut its top expensive ll wet in the sun is big , but it is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star we known of i nor galaxy ."
22594,som do my friends say their bill is like 20 per month or lassie ! i live ina n apartment . yeah that insanely huge !
22595,"i just ca n't afford to convert . wish i could . also , neptune just completed its first full orbit around the sun since it was discovered in 1846 6 ."
22596,"yeah right , that ta slow orbiting plane !"
22597,"i would be so young there , lol . are you a movie fan . i am a big movie buff . or instance , clueless the movie is loosely based on jane alston 's ' emma ' ."
22598,nice ! i didnt know that . mark twain hated jane karsten ' s ' pride nad prejudice '
22599,"i did n't know that . well , three of her novels were rejected when they were sent to major publishing companies under different names un 2004 ."
22600,"interesting . the word ' literally ' has been used figuratively for hundreds of years . charles dickens , charlotte bronx ' , and just , and mark twain all used i for hyperbole ."
22601,"that is a good fact . the lord of the rings by j . r . r . tolkien ; pride and prejudice by jane austin ; his dark materials by philip ullman ; and the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy by douglas adams , were the top four novels voted on by she bbc in the uk in 2003 ."
22602,nice ! there are great books !
22603,yes they are . jane austin works critique the novels of sensitivity of the second hal for the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19thcebntury literary realism . not my cup of tea .
22604,"great talking to you , have a good one !"
22605,there were sure some rave reviews about that teen titans movie !
22606,yes its awesome
22607,"i was n't interested in seeing it at first but the reviewer really loved the music and sense of humor . he , or she ? , made a good point that i'ts great even for adu , ts ."
22608,the original teen titans from like 15 years ago was fantastic when i was a kid so i wasnt such a big fan of the newer one until i saw the film . what cartoon id you like as a kid .
22609,"i was a sucker for looney tunes , and also stuff like superb a it 's interesting to see how the whole superhero genre has evolved and become a lot more serious now ."
22610,looney tunes was the best and so was tom and jerry i always loved diff duck alot of modern dye cartoons are based on his antics
22611,"diff and bugs are timeless ! ! it 's funny seeing tom and jerry through more adult eyes ; they are n't quite as funny as they seemed back then . remember a few years back when they made a liveaction movie involving the looney tunes characters with some live action , u think shaq or some other basketbal ; l player , ."
22612,that movie is a classic its called spacejam they even made na edition of the michael jordan shoes or the movie
22613,hah ! i should have known it was mj in the movie e ! ! it was definitely a different kind of movie ethan the superhero stuff they mostly make nowadays jv very reminiscent of who framed roger rabbit .
22614,who framed roger rabbit is one of my favorite childhood films and it had the actor who played the scientist doc in back o the future . did you ever see the new wonder woman film ?
22615,"i did see ww , and thought it was really good , though i was mad that the killed off chris pine 's character , . the superhero movies are definitely taking a darker turn than they did when i was younger . much , such gritty and darker and more serious ."
22616,i think it definitely started with movies like space and aikman but only recently really started taking off with antman begins and the dark knight
22617,"yep . dc versus marvel , ; marvel gets more publicity and produces more movies , bt dc has w lot of really good stories too . it 's neat that they have more consistent ' worlds ' where one movie flows ino another , like wonder woman appearing in one of the batman movies , ."
22618,which do you liek better marvel or dc ?
22619,"third to say . dc is superman , which is kind of where it all started in my mind . but marvel has produced a lot of really , really good stuff . i 'm still trying to figure out how they 're going to recover from dissolving half their characters in the latest aenge5se movie ! how abut you ?"
22620,i love marvel because i was a big fan of the forst 2 spiderman films it went downhill after that for the original series i m also a big fan of ironman and hulk
22621,"marvel . keeps reinventing or freebooting their characters , in movies but least ; i do n't read the comics , . i guess it 's a way to keep the stories and characters current . of course so does dc , they just do n't have quite as many movies in any given year . it 's kind of interesting when they come out with a new movie and ' new ' characters , that turn at to be familiar if you keep up with the print comics , ."
22622,i did not like suicide squad bt all their rendition of hte joker ws too comedic for me .
22623,"i actually never saw that on e , somehow , but i cam believe it . in the tv batman , that her was , well , a joe but in the first movie , years and years ago , they mad him out to eb a real psychopath ."
22624,i moved the 1960s tv batman he was fantastic along wath jack nicholson 's rendition
22625,"adam west was sooooo campy and funny as batman ! ! nicholson 's joker was the one taht really , really brought home how psychopathic the character could be . what leggero 's joker was pretty scary as well . gotham , tv series , has an interesting take on the universe too ."
22626,gotham has he a way better job then suicide squad ever could will smith and harley quinn characters really saved tthat film
22627,what character dried will smith play ? and is it true harley quinn as the joker 's daughter ?
22628,he payed deadshotg o watch the film you can see it on movies or solarmovies google it
22629,"i 'll have to check for it soon ; i want to se it before , just never had the time . got done with a luke cage or jessica jones or punisher binge re , actively recently because my son was watching them all . hose feel more ' real ' than gotham etc . but he boy are they dark ! ! !"
22630,punisher film from 2004 is a masterpiece give it a watch but it takes bar to a whole norther level
22631,"hi , do you like superheroes ?"
22632,"hmm . . . well i kind of did as a kid im thee 60 's and 1970 's , the superman and batman type . i was never into the comic book source of the heros but i did enjoy the cartoon and tv shows based off hem ."
22633,i love them . there is a comic series bout fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes .
22634,"i read that , do made me laugh af the irony a little bit . i did read about stan lee last year when he died an shoe got a lot of good press . if he wrote 15 dc comic series reimagining superhero 's he must have been a pretty creative guy and good writer ."
22635,that ' interesting . i had no idea he also wrote 15 of the dc comics .
22636,"yes , and he ended every phone conversation by saying ' excelsior ! ' , he sounded like quite a character ."
22637,that 's very funny . he wa sa good guy too sure . there is a garfield book series spinoff named pet force and it 's all of the garfield characters acting as superheroes .
22638,"yes , teh genre seems tom e to lend itself to that , like the ' normalman ' who 's the only nonsupef hero on a planet populated by superhero 's . that ironic sad kind of funny too , then again they 're called comic books !"
22639,that is ironic . i saw that all takes place in in earth199999 .
22640,"yes , tat a lot of years in the future . does n't the earth 's sun , run out of fuel and burn up sometime before then according to astronomers ? do you like wonde woman ? that movie was the highestgrossing origin pie and wwi movie , sounds like a studio 's dream as a money maker ."
22641,i think it does ? k 've never seen wonder woman . that 's pretty amazing it grossed that much .
22642,"i read that when she first showed up in the comics in 1941 she was originally the justice society 's secretary . that a little sexist , but then again in 1941 maybe they did n't think so ."
22643,that is very sexist . i bet that would n't fly in our society today .
22644,"no it would n't and good for society for evolving . did you know that gal gadot , the actress who played wonderwoman actually thought she was testing for catwoman , the old female superhero switcharoo . . ."
22645,wow i did not knw that . did you know michigan state has the largest public comic book collection in the world ?
22646,"no , that was news t me . i went to illinois in the big 10 and i 've been to michigan state , but i was unaware it was the emma of comic book collections . did you kno wthe the dc in dc comics stands for detective comics so dc comics and detective comics comics , redundant indeed . i wonder how though up that in the first place ?"
22647,i wonder as was . i saw that marvel once published a generic comic book to trademark the names superhero and supervillain .
22648,"yes , i wonder if the stories in generic comic book was populated entirely by lawyers as they needed that sideline so the lawyers could trade mark ' superhero , villain ' etc . as super abilities over the average ?"
22649,i wonder that as well . did you know female superheroes spare sometimes called superheroine ?
22650,"i think that superheroine is actually more correct grammatical , bu , few more letters to pronounce . i also sa what comic books have some origins in 18th century japan , becoming popular in the us in the 1930 's . i wonder how those original japanese comics were marketed in japan and where they sold them ."
22651,it was good talking to you !
22652,did you see the ponder woman movie ?
22653,"yea , i though bart jenkins did a great job directing wonder woman"
22654,it was the highest grossing superhero origin movie nd also the highest grossing ww1 movie . i was surprised to find that out .
22655,"well gal gadot did a great job in the wonder woman role , i 'm sure they helped"
22656,yes . i had no idea who she was before that . i wa surprised to find out that she served 2 years as a soldier int he israel defense enforces . so she already had some real life training for the role .
22657,"yea , i guess that training was put into great use since hte movie takes place during wwi"
22658,"right ! w hen sue auditioned for wonder woman , gal thought she was testing for catwoman . lol"
22659,that 's pretty funny . did you know the inventor of the lie detector test asl created wonder woman ?
22660,i did n't know that ! do you like to read comic books ? i did when i was a kid .
22661,"ya . i loved reading garfield , it 's funny they originally owned the gmail . com domain"
22662,i did n't know that and yes ! i loved garfield too . michigan state university library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world . i wonder if people still check them out ?
22663,probably 3d id you know marvel comics had to spend 10 years convincing the us government xmen were not human ?
22664,lol i did n't know that . how crazy is that ?
22665,"pretty crazy . dc alto only paid 130 for the rights to superman in 1938 , they made out big time"
22666,wow . yes thy did . i is found out thatd c comics stands for detective comics .
22667,"pretty redundant , but they also invented the term brainiac '"
22668,nice . there are over 300 registered superheroes int he usa .
22669,"petty crazy , there 's suppose to 30 superhero movies released between 20162020"
22670,wo . they are making a ton of money off of them . they will probably keeps king them until people stole watching . there is actually a superhero called normalman who was the only person without superpowers n a planet full of superheroes . that 's funny .
22671,i 'm just glad michael jackson was n't able to buy marvel comics to play spiderman
22672,he might have changed up the role somehow an would have ruined did . i had fun chatting ! have a good one .
22673,hi wh ow are you ? do you like movies ?
22674,"hi ! i love movies ! i liked the teen titans , did you see if ?"
22675,i personally didnt ' watch this particular movie . what was it about ?
22676,it is z superhero movie ; do you like superheros ?
22677,i love superhero movies and i did watch one of my favorite superhero movies and it was wonder woman a 2017 movie .
22678,i love wonder woman too . did you know stan lee almost changer careers ? t hat sold have been sad !
22679,yes that would of been . i loved stan lee and without him there are no dc comics .
22680,"exactly , so sad he passed , bug he will live on through this work . he co created hulk , iron ma ex me n , so many that probably would not have been movies if he was n't around ."

22721,why wouldnt that be something to worry about ?
22722,"well , google went down or about 5 minutes at i point , and it took down 0 percent of web traffic with it ."
22723,oh thats why i shouldnt worry about self driving cars as artickal intelligence ? that makes sense lol

22726,"a robot , programmed y a computer l could also be designed to carry out a conversation like this ."
22727,"ia that a hint ? ? are you a robot ? yeah , i think companies already fo tht , have an automated answering survive , pretty weird ."
22728,"facebook , is developing ana i to understand emotions ana identify stuff , so there 's a those kind of ai or robots ."
22729,i hear google artificial intelligence class uses google hangouts to teach more efficiently .
22730,i believe it stanford 's free artificial intelligence class that uses hangouts to each more effectively .
22731,kristen stewart co authored a paper about artifical intelligence .
22732,i wonder if someone at google ever read it .
22733,why ?
22734,google employees that need help could improve their knowledge y reading i t .
22735,did you know robots can be controlled by using rat brains ?

22743,"same , i use i ta lot when i 'm going to take , liar places too win order to see if there is traffic on the road or ana accident"
22744,"whenever google goes down even for one second , where is usually a big uproar by users"
22745,"i ca n't say i 've ever witness it going down , have you ?"
22746,"no , but i did witness blutube going down recently ."
22747,that would not be good ! i use youtube to create y gym playlist . i now see here on the fact that google did go down on 8 or 16 or 2013 for 5 minutes and i too 40 percent of the web traffic with it . wow
22748,did you see the google ceo testify before congress recently ?
22749,"i did not . why was he testifying ? did it have to do wit tracking phones ? , maybe i did . . . . ,"
22750,8 ca n't recall but i do remember a senator embarrassing themself by asking a question about facebook
22751,"i think i saw a clip ! and he was trying to explain how the internet works tp one of the gov't officials and as was almost comical how eh , the gov't official , could n't comprehend lol ."
22752,and we wonder why the government is shutdown today and why they cant seem to come to an agreement .
22753,right ? ? i think we ar neon day 20 of do ? we sure could use some of the smart tech ceo 's in office
22754,the google ceo seemed articula5e phd impressed e enough that i think he would do well in elected office .
22755,"i think many of these younger guys would , but they might have ah hard tme convincing the older generations to vote for them"
22756,i usually use google for all of my news content to see how things are going in the governemnt
22757,same here . it is interesting that google changes is maps basis on the border claims of each country !
22758,i wonder how they are dealing with the border security is neon google ? can you see the border wall on google maps ?
22759,"i 'm not sure ! i believe maps are updated every so often , i 've never looked at taht specific area though"
22760,i am going to be look it up on google right now .
22761,have you heard about google duped ?
22762,i have not . have you heard of it ?
22763,"a little bit . it is apparently a new , humansoundin voice assistant ."
22764,it would b cool to hav johns legend make reservations for me though !
22765,"it might be , but voice taht sounds exactly like a human could be troubling ."

22771,"true . in 2013 , google went down for five minutes and took out 40 percent of the web traffic !"
22772,they also use goats to mow their corporate headquarters .
22773,that is funy . who use android devices to determined traffic for maps .
22774,they also manipulated borders when there is a dispute over it .
22775,it is amazing how much artificial intelligence is coming from google .
22776,i know . plus their self driving cars too ! they are going to own the world .
22777,even those earning about ai from stanford used coogler hangouts !
22778,i ' v only use hangouts once ? . have you ever used it ?
22779,yes . i was in a session once with grant imahara from mythbusters .

22788,there are lso 7 string guitars hen 6 do n't do the job .
22789,very funny . guitars the played with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings with either a pick or the fingers of one hand while simultaneously fretting with the fingers pf the other hand . coo l !
22790,"i seent it ! guitar what ave 7 strings . no film . they can be picked with finger , toes , tongues , what have you . jimi kendrick used his teeth ."
22791,"cool , love that hendrix music . the sun doof the vibrating strings are projected lighter acoustically or electronically ."
22792,i would say electronically for she must part . i figure the acoustic part is pretty good but not as sexy .
22793,hen eddie van halen recorded the guitar solo for ' beat it ; he literally set the studio speakers on fire .
22794,he is a budding pyromaniak . he destroyed perfectly good equipment because of his passion .
22795,"speaking of eddie fan holden , did you know that he p , layer that solo for michael as a favor and free of charge ?"
22796,"eddie probably didnt need the money but he probably could have used tix to one of michael hows . or maybe tat glove that michael was ep plus eddie set fire to the equipment , so he owed him for that ."
22797,michael is pretty wild too . i you know that freddie mercury cancelled a duet with michael in the 60s decals michael insisted on bringing his llama to the studio ? hardeharhar !

22802,"michael was a true hero to us humans , a nd to the llamas . he should be remembered as a 50 feet statue in the dessert ."
22803,"well he was famous for his robot and moonwalk dance ! michael 's distinctive sound and style has influenced any , many artists of various genres ."

22815,"i agree , michael has n't been noncreepg since he recorded thrillers with the band got"
22816,heh . fair point . he wanted to build a 50 foot robot of himself to wander the nevada desert . . which is intereting .
22817,"i 'd be down if the robot did the moonwalk , even though mj did n't invent it"

22856,holy cow ! that is crazy to think about . i guess they use android devices to calculate traffic by seeing how fast they are moving down the road .
22857,"instead of hiring people to mow the lawns around their headquarters , google once use hundreds to live goats ."

23032,"well , at a recent screening , the filmmakers herself seemed eager to manage expectations . in a taped prologue , duvernay purged filmgoers to catchy huge movie whirl in touch with their ' inner child , ' a useful piece of advice for a movie that turns out to be a kids ' fil m , for better and for worse ."
23033,"i love walt disney pictures , so exciting . the book came out so long ago this will be a treat !"
23034,"i kno w , densely is hte best . ' the lion king ' was hte first disney film to be dubbed into zulu for its african release ."

23038,i have . i have also seen frozen . frozen was the first animated disney film directed by a woman n .
23039,"wow , that 's awesome ! frozen is the best !"
23040,"i know , disney is great , in general . . . during the 70s , disney recycled a lot of the animation frames , resulting in identical scenes in some movies"
23041,oh i did not know that ! did you know the four cultures in disney 's th jungle book were both designed after and originally supposed to bey voiced y the beats .
23042,"i did not , but like i did not know thet oy industry gets involved in disney animations even before the beginning of the film production ."
23043,really ? how cool is that . very interesting !
23044,"i know . i learn , much here . the richest superhero is actually black panther , who has an estimated of 500 billion , whereas tony stark is worth 10 billion and bruce wayne 80 billion"
23045,"wow , that 's a lot of money . i love marvel movies ."
23046,me too . the emperor of japan is a scientist and still publishes papers to this day . i think he will catch up to the black panther shortly .
23047,"true ! i really like the director of black panther , ryan coogler he did an amazing job !"
23048,"he did a great job . i was impressed with the shoots all movie long . the symbols and written script featured in back panther are base don an actual script called nsibdi , dating back as far as the 4th century and indigenous to presently nigeria"
23049,really ? t hat 's interesing ! i did n't know that . did you know chadwick boseman could n't afford the summer theater program at oxford and denzel washington funded his tuition !

23053,"whoa , that 's awesome !"
23054,"right ? marvel censored m'baku 's utterance of ' praise hanuman ! ' in indian releases of black panther , fearing tat showing a seemingly villains character praising a hind od would lead to backlash . indians reacted highly negatively as they found that empowering rather than insulting ."
23055,very interesting !
23056,dui doyou know harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon .
23057,no ! ? that is amazing ! did you know it is ilegal in queensland to own a rabbit unless you are a scientist or a magician ?

23076,are you a cat disney fan ?
23077,"not really as such , b ut i like some of the disney creations despite their corporate culture . how about you ?"
23078,i used to when my kids were little . i got enjoyment out of seeing them enjoy the movie . they love the lion king which was the first disney film to be dubbed into zulu for it 's release it south africa .
23079,"i remeber being excited when the trailers for a wrinkle in time came ou t , and then forgot all about it . i 've got to see that ! have you seen it ?"
23080,i 've have n't seen that one . during the 70 's disney recycled a lot of their animation frames resulting in identical scenes in some movies . interesting .
23081,"i think the 70s were the big period of reputable cells , were n't they ?"
23082,yes . i believe you are right . frozen was the first animated disney film directed by a woman !
23083,i 've never seen that one . have ou seen b ; lack panther ? i 'm trying to get better about actually watching movies that i want to see her they 're advertised .
23084,i 'm actually gettin very to watch it soon . do you have netflix ? it 's now on there for free . it was produced by marvel studios and distributed by disney as well .
23085,really ? i should check out what the cost of a netflix subscription costs .
23086,"it 's fairly cheap . you can share it with other people as well . we have amazon prime , but also hearse a netflix account with out older kids . if you can stream in out like between family members , yoy could really hae if or only a few dollars per month . then you could watch the black panther ! did you know the character name was briefly changed to ' black leopard ' ?"
23087,"i did n't know that . definitely want to see it though . thanks for the info on netflix . i 'll see which is the best deal , it or amazon prime ."
23088,"entry , a would be cheaper probably fo month to month . amazon prime is 120 for a year but you can also get it monthly . not sure of that price though . you also get the free 2 day shipping as well in addition to teh video movies and shows . do you know much about scientists ?"
23089,"just the dumbeddown science coverage in the pop science journals i 'm afraid , although it 's something i 'm very curious about . do you ?"
23090,haha me too . i was reading a little about some today . akihito the emperor of japan is a scientist an still publishes paper to this day !
23091,i 'll bet he viewed having to take the throne as a sacrifice what kept him from doing waht he loved .
23092,i wonder . i 'm going to google him when we 're done . harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the mon . interesting . think they would have a more than one go there .
23093,i just assumed the astronauts be reall career fighter pilots before the space shuttle opened things up to a wider variety of people .
23094,yes it did . i 'm kind of based that it does n't make flights any longer . did you know that the world wide web was invented in 1989 by an english scientist working in switzerland ? wow did the internet ome on faster taht i though .
23095,"really ? i assume that was bernerslee , but i did n't know is location ."
23096,i did n't know ho it was before today . lol it was nice chatting with you !
23097,its sad how that 12 year old had part of his brain removed .
23098,i ' v hear that people can recover . some brain functionality an shift to new parts of th brain .
23099,the kid says he feels normal but getting rid of a part of the ryan surely must have further consequences .
23100,"manner is getting therapy to help him develop . he ca n't play certain sports , but other than that , he might have a pretty normal life ."
23101,"i heard his case was published in the scientific journal cell reports , it might be interesting to on it up and learn more about anne ."
23102,it 's certainly an interesting case . do you play board games like chess ?
23103,i like to play but im not good at it that about you ?
23104,"i 'm not really into chess . it 's a complex game . for example , there are more possible moves in chess than atoms in the universe ."
23105,i guest thats why the president of the world chess federation believes chess was invented by aliens .
23106,i wonder who those aliens are . the ones that are using area 51 as an airbnb ? t hr negative correlation between iq and chess says soemthing about the mind and intelligence .
23107,"i wouldnt know about that , and i did hear there is a correlation , being a good chess player must require a big inflelect ."
23108,it 's funny that there 's a negative correlation . probably iq test measured different ability . one grandmaster beat a friend at age 5 and did n't even look at he board .
23109,he jada chess in his blood for sure lol although the official story is that i was created in india and later improved by the persians .
23110,are you a tennis fan ?
23111,"i love tennis and also love to wear polo shirts , they are really comfortable to wear ."
23112,the shirts originally designed for tennis players ? funny that the inventor called them polo shirts ! and why they crocodile ?
23113,"maybe thats why racist has a crocodile as brand logo , you know back in 1968 a black man won a us open tennis tittle , i cant recall any black champions since ."
23114,i guess that must have been arthur ashe . i ca n't recall any others either . it 's funny that they used a helicopter to dry the grass in 1969 . that 's a rich man 's solution to a problem ! lol
23115,"thats funny and also really weird lol , tennis ca nobel really boring if a attach extend i winder how the players keep up ."
23116,"the prize money p ; probably helps focus the mind . a match thaat lasts 10 hours andc cakes place over three days . a bit much , though ."
23117,"i know , even for the audience , like et it over already lol"
23118,did you hear about the boy who had part of his brain removed due to a time r ?
23119,"no , i have not heard about that ! how old was he ?"
23120,"only twelve , and apart from s few problem with his vision , he 's fairly normal . he still does therapy and avoids contact sports , but he 's fairly active"
23121,at least the operation worked out for him . do could not imagine having any of my brain removed .
23122,"it would be hard , and it took months for him to over , but he can still do things ike playing volleyball and tennis , so that 's fairly impressive and shows how advanced teh medical field has gotten"
23123,that is really impressive . it is amazing that we are capable of doing things like this at all .
23124,"i know ! another amazing feat are the ones who played in the longest tennis match in history . even though it spread over 3 days , 11 hours is a long time for one match"
23125,11 hours ? ? i woul dave purposefully missed the ball lol
23126,"it so have been an important match . the us open is important enough that in 1969 , they used a helicopter to dry the grass court"
23127,i forgot that there are actual important matches in tennis . it is not a sport i watch . i wonder who was playing that us open match in 1969 .
23128,i 'm not sure since it 's not a sport i pay much attention to either . the only place an to win first place in hte us lps won in 1968 . i wonder if e was an inspiration to th williams sisters
23129,i am sure he must have even . i think i read that theur father had them train every single day . i wonder if h new about this man .
23130,"he lilly does . i wonder if they had a natural talent for the game like gael monfils did . just days after learning how to play , he beat the ' roger federer of paddle tennis '"
23131,i wondered the same thing . it seems odd that two sisters would both excel as much as the do in any one activity . what is paddle tennis ? pingpong ;
23132,"i believe so . another name for it is table tennis . i think playing at that level would take the same level lof concentration as it does to play a game of chess , though i do n't really pay either"
23133,i had no idea that it was ever called table tennis . oh it definitely as to take some serious concentration . the amount of adrenaline the probably feel played a game .
23134,there was a five year old who beat a family friend at chess without looking at the board . that has to be a bad of natural talent
23135,natural talent and really good memorizatio skills or something . i would have loved to watch that happen .
23136,"i 'm sure the kid had a lot of fun winning that . the game can be traced back to into during the gupta empire , yet the presiden of th world chess federation has a theory that it sas invented by aliens"
23137,he has a feeling that the game of chess was invented by aliens .
23138,so the aliens came back during that empire ? or did they live during the persian empire when the game was improved . maybe we 'll never know
23139,have you heard about the 12 year old who had a 6th of his brain removed ?
23140,i have actually . that 's pretty crazy . he said he fees like a ' perfectly normal 12yearoldboy . '
23141,"the surgery was 6 years ago , so he has adapted a bit . but tha is so great hat he fuels normal and doesnt have many problems ."
23142,"yeah , we 've come so far rain the pas few decades with medical technology . it 's absolutely amzing !"
23143,"it really is , and even our bodies are able go adapt . i ha dmb static nerve removed due to cancer , add should not have any hasting function , but my body has retained a little ."
23144,"that 's awesome ! i think tha little boy has som issues too , like a few blind spots , but the human odd is an amazing machine tat can adapt to almost anything !"
23145,"yeah , the left show of his brain stepped up and took over th function ."
23146,"it 's really interesting . so it your static nerve removed , have you lost a lot of motor fiction ?"
23147,"yeah , i cant be my for at all or move it . i have some feeling on the inner part but nothing else . same goes for the calf ."
23148,"that 's really cool that you seem to be in good spirits about it , much like the little boy . i suess an event like that an really change your overall perspective ."
23149,it really does . i figure getting mad bout t doesnt cage anything .
23150,"that 's true , im a , w or re all just kind of a super in the universe , and it 's important to use our time wisely while we have it ."
23151,very true . i was listening to a few podcasts about the universe that too .
23152,really ? which ones ? and what 's some cool stuff you learned about from them ?
23153,it is the nba of the world as you know it podcast . it started faking about if we are alone in the universe .
23154,"yeah , i 've heard of that podcast . stat 's awesome 2 i think some scientist believe hat there is a ' cold spot ' int he universe that may lead to a parallel universe . it 's really hard to wrap my head around !"
23155,it is . part of it was talking about what if there is life exact to be there but hasve evolved like we have . really blows my mind
23156,"yeah , big 's a super existential feeling , like the theory that our entire universe away just be inside a b ; hack hole . it reminds me of the movie interstellar ."
23157,"i didnt see that one . , was it good ?"
23158,it 's really food . nad ther science i the movie was confirmed by a bunch of highlevel scientists and physicists . i 'm pretty sure their redeeming of the blackhole seen is end used to study blackhole sin real litle .
23159,wow . ill have to heck it out . the creation of the universe and possibility of life outside of our solar system or galaxy is intriguing .
23160,"oh yeah , it really puts lie into perspective ."
23161,"it does , i makes me wonder if there is a sort of superior life that doesnt seem us as intelligent life as we look at bacteria or something else ."
23162,"alright , well it was wonderful talking to you . i 'm def gon na check out that podcast no ! thanks again !"
23163,have a great night ! t was a great chat !
23164,do you like to play chess ?
23165,"well i used to play actually , i'ts pretty our what about you ?"
23166,yeah . . . did you know that there are ore possible moves in chess than there are atoms i nthe entire universe ?
23167,"no i did n't , i do know that i read a book by judit polar , she apparently beat a family friend at chess when she was only 5 which is impressive"
23168,that is crazy ! i could n't even imagine doing that ! i am definitely not that good ! lol
23169,"haha not at all , also weird is there is a negative correlation between iq adn chess kill , meaning that high intelligence is n't necessary for good chess playng apparently"
23170,"oh yeah . . . i can understand why . a lot of higher intel , pence does n't have the intuition for strategy like you have to have in chess ."
23171,"it is interesting that chess was invented in india , then later the persians improved on thati is , that 's a long time ago"
23172,that is a long time ago q
23173,have you heard the theory that the whole universe is only a hologram ?
23174,no i haven ' t ? how do they figure that ?
23175,"well they say this whole universe is like virtual reality , kind o fluke the matrix wher ew ware all plugged in , elon musk believes that apparently"
23176,"ou yeah ? elon musk is quit seth eccentric visionary , that 's for sure !"
23177,"ya he has his own way about him or sure , there is another theory ow the universe is a single electron but i do n't kno how what works haha"
23178,ohh ow ! t hose are some far fetched theories ! ! ! i just saw that there ars stars that are cold enough for us to touch . wonder how that works ?
23179,ha thats another one i do n't understand ! do you play or watch tennis ? that is one sport i do play and will occasionally watch
23180,well . . . i have n't played in a very long guice . and i have n't watched since amass retired .
23181,"ya i liked amass , ca n't imagine a 3 day tennis match , that was the longest match and it lasted 11 hours that soso exhausting"
23182,dnagggggg . . . yeah . . . . that 's a bit much ! lol
23183,"also a bit much is using a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts , seems crazy too haha"
23184,omg . . . yeah i saw that one ! that 's one expensive way to do that for sure 2
23185,"salsa crazy is no black man has won the us open since 1968 , i wonder why that is"
23186,do yoy know much about h universe ?
23187,some stuff . there is a theory that it was formed through revolution
23188,yeah and another one that there is only one electron in it
23189,yet another one that it is just a giant hologram
23190,there are stars hat are cold enough for us to touch them
23191,that is soc you . do you like chess ?
23192,somewhat . there are tons of moves in the game though
23193,yes more positive moves than atoms in the universe
23194,yeah pretty impressive . d you know who the president of the federation thinks invented the game ?
23195,yes he thinks it was the aliens
23196,yeah and the game was in reality invented in india
23197,yes during the gupta empire and the the persians refined it
23198,"was , there is a negative correlation between iq nd chess"
23199,yeah i always thought it was the opposite of that
23200,yeah me too . do you know who judit polar is ?
23201,yes he is a chess master and he beat someone at th year of 5
23202,"he is a genius , you have to be pretty good at it for that one"
23203,i know . do you like tennis ?
23204,"i do , do you know how the export relates to polo shirts ?"
23205,"yes , they were invented by a tennis player , rene lacoste"
23206,yeah and then adopted by the others
23207,"hi , do you like literature ?"
23208,somewhat . i know that the fda burned 6 tons of it in an act of censorship .
23209,that 's pretty crazy . i saw there is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel .
23210,i do n't kow if that would be tough ore easy todo o ? lol
23211,"8 think that would be though to do honestly . in 1953 , winston churchill won a nobel prize for literature ."
23212,wow . i never knew that . romantic kissing is a fairly recent development on literature .
23213,i did not know that either . what is romantic kissing ?
23214,when 2 people come together to kiss passionately in a loving way ? lol
23215,"ahh loop . architecture , literature , music , painting , and sculpture were all olympic events from 19121952 ."
23216,i wonder how that worked out for the judging ? had to have been tough . co pu like poetry ?
23217,i like poetry . what about you ?
23218,"i do . but , do n't have much time to read it ; edgar allan poe only received 9 for hte publication of ' the raven ' . ow ."
23219,that 's crazy . i would have never imagine that .
23220,i know right ? demetri martin wrote a 224 word palindrome poem . that sounds ike a pretyy limp ; agressive feet !
23221,that sounds hard to do . almost all of the hobbit 's character names were taken out of an od icelandic poem ; .
23222,"neat 's pretty neat . always wondered where they got those names from . i would be curious to read the poem that when read normally is depressing , but if you read it backwards it 's inspiring ."
23223,yea it 's pretty cool . do you like cats ?
23224,i like ca . i have 2 outside came . they have cat cafes in japan where people pa an hurry rate to blah with cats and have drinks 2
23225,"i like a , but i like dogs a little eater . that 's hilarious you can pay to drink with cats , ."
23226,anything to make ad dollar ! there is a place in alaska called talkeetna there they have a cat named stubbs as their mayor . must be for publicity purposes . lol
23227,good talking to you !
23228,do you enjoy reading ? i kind of do . there is somehting intriguing about it . there has als been a ; lot lof important information written down . no wonder he fda burned over six tons of literature !
23229,"i love to read , but would never want to read something that won the literature contest for worst opening sentence !"
23230,haha yeah that is a good point . what about poetry ? i am no ta huge fan but there is something special about its long history dating back to prehistorical times with hunting poetry in africa .
23231,"i do n't love poetry , but do enjoy some of churchill 's wo . i 'm surprised his nobel prize was n't fo literature"
23232,oh yeah churchill is classic for sure . i kno wi think he deserved to wish eli sa definitely a household name da another classic poet is edgar allan pence he only recieved 9 for his poem the ravennow it 's a classic !
23233,that 's a great poem ! i 'm curious to read demetri martin 's 224 word palindrome poem . it sounds interesting !
23234,"oh yet i have never heard of martin . palindrome poems are interesting though i would give it a read s well . i went to indonesia once . did you know the javanese alphabet when recited in order , forms a ; 'm ? i would like to hear that ."
23235,"that 's very cool ! i would also love to read th poem that is depressing , but inspiring when read backwards . that takes talent to write !"
23236,yes very good point ! do you have any cats . i feel like lots of poets have cats . in japan you can pay an hourly rate to play with cats and have drinks !
23237,i do n't . i do n't really like cats ! the physicist who coauthored with his cat to use first person plural made me laugh .
23238,"yea i am more of a dog person . haha yeah i would agree with you . all they do is sleep . 6 the age of 15 , a cat will have spent 10 of hose years sleeping . so boring ! !"
23239,how do cats always have good things happen to them though ? i mean the stray cat found on set that was then in the godfather is probably living the good life .
23240,"yes i bet he is . must be that whole 9 lives business . they can just relive until they get good fortune . also quite surprising here are 70 cat breeds , seems likes a lot to me ."
23241,yes and how does a cat become mayor and actually do anything for hte town of talkeetna ?
23242,good question ! definitely more of a symbolic gesture . otherwise what town would be in shameless ! if i had a mouse problems i may consider getting a cat though .
23243,it kind of makes sense that sculpture use to b and olympic seventy because in the old days there were tons of cat cultures !
23244,"oh thats see i never though of that . yeah i know in certain cultures , like the egyptians l that used to worship cats ."
23245,it 's also interesting that past culture never mentioned kissing because lot 's a new development .
23246,when did kissing first become a thing ? it ha always been odd to me but it is a universal signal of affection so i guess everyone does it nw and t ' snormla !
23247,"i guess maybe they used poetry to show love o others since they were big into literature ? ? i mean they took all the name for th hobbit character out of dvergatal , so poems were important !"
23248,oh i did n't know that . i love the hobbit or lord of the rings . now i know where their names come from !
23249,very cool ! nice chatting with you !
23250,how 's it going ? do you like cats ? i have one myself but have no idea which one of the 70 breeds ! is
23251,i have 3 cats ! i did n't know there were so many different breeds !
23252,"yea tey 're pretty cool . they have a cat cafe near my house where yo ca buy coffee and spend time with cats , i wonder if it 's the same as hte cat cafes in japan nd taiwan"
23253,i had no idea they had those around ! do you like to read too ? the fda burned six tons of literature . an act of us censorship
23254,"yea , i wonder what books the fda burned d , makes e want to read the more now"
23255,met is ! this sounds fun hugh . ther eis a annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel . i take up in the morning . . .
23256,"hmm , that sounds like a fun challenge to come up with the worst possible opening sentence . i 'd just write ' k , whatever '"
23257,": , that might work ! in 1953 sir winston churchill won a nobel prize , and it was in literature , not peace . that ?"
23258,"that 's intersting , i wonder what churchill whole about that got him a nobel prize , wonder if it was about wwii"
23259,"maybe so ! i should look that up . this is wild ! architecture , literature , music , painting and sculpture were olympic events from 1962 until 1952 ."
23260,"j never knew that , sound 's interesting , i ponder if poetry was ever an event , poetry does come from a greek word"
23261,i think it 's from poiesis . old see poetry battles in the olympics ?
23262,"demetri martin would probably earn a medal , i can not even rap my head around trying o write a 224 word palindrome poem"
23263,"thats crazy ! this would be so cool to hear ! poetry has a long history , dating back to prehistorical times witht the creation of hunting poetry in africa ."
23264,that 's pretty neat but i wonder how researchers could even figure out it was poetry nad bow it rhymes
23265,maybe this will help answer it . some of the earliest written poetry in africa can be found among the pyramid texts .
23266,"lol , hylographic poetry on pyramids , now taht is insane"
23267,they call it griot court poetry .
23268,"interesting , it 's pretty crazy there is poems that are depressing read forward but inspiring read backwards , that must take a lot of time and creativity to make"
23269,"i had no idea ! i would n't even think about reading gem backwards ! the japanese alphabet , when recited in order , forms a poem"
23270,"hello , do you no they have cat cafes in japan and taiwan ?"
23271,"never heard about that , sounds strange wonder how it works ?"
23272,"i do n't know , people pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks ."
23273,wow strange . i did hear taht when a cat reaches 15 hears old it would have already spent 10 years sleeping .
23274,"i believe that , all my cats do is asleep ! did you know stubbs the cat is the mayor in a town in alaska !"
23275,yeah since 1997 right ? now that is truly strange . the at in the opening scene of the godfather was a stray .
23276,i would like to watch that again and look for that . ha
23277,yeah i remember the don striking a cat while he was ejecting wit some ppl . you know there are more thank 0 breeds of cat .
23278,"yes , did you know the fda burned 6 tons of literature ?"
23279,now why would they want to destroy so many bodies of ours ? did you know tha literature use to be in the olympics ?
23280,"acts of censorship . yes , i wish they still did that . i would love to see painting and sculpture etc ."
23281,me too apparently the events were fled between 1912 ana 1952 . poems on the other hand can be interesting as well .
23282,i agree . did you know poetry dates back to prehistoric times . starting in hunting poetry in africa .
23283,wow ! you know there a poem when read normally is depressing but when read backward is u ; uplifting ?
23284,i
23285,"early poems in the eurasia continent evolved from folk songs , like chinese shining ."
23286,"yes , i knew abou 'the backward ; poems , is n't that interesting . for song , that makes sense . some of the earliest african poems comes from pyramid texts , writting in th 95th century bce ."
23287,i think you mean the 25th century . however some of earliest western asian poetry include the epic of gilgamesh and was written in sumerian .
23288,"yes , my keys are sticking . thank you your right the 25th century ! wow , i am surprised edgar allan poe only got paid 9 for the raven !"
23289,"i figured as much , lol . yes tha toes not seem right . hav eyou ever seen the read the hobbit ?"
23290,"yes , i have and of it . have you heard of the old icelandic poem dvergatal ?"
23291,yes i have i was going to tell you that an she characters named in thee bobbit come from the old icelandic poem . nice chatting with you .
23292,good morning 2 elon musk is at it again the spacex program is going places !
23293,i agree ! he 's been sending things to the international space station now !
23294,yes proof that the private sector is more than capable in this industry to succeed and thrive . wonder how nasa feels ?
23295,i 'm sure they are always wanting to get back more into it . ? the place i work for manages the cape canaveral launch pad so we are doin gore and more business with space x than nasa these days .
23296,"that souds like an interesting jo ! i eas amazed when spacex was able to land he boosters back on the jaws i got so used to them just falling into the ocean bt he boosters are now reputable , which cuts the costs dramatically ."
23297,"i wonder how much money they save doing that ! ai has come a long ways , not only with that , but with nonprofits spreading tha dvancemetn o fair !"
23298,very true and i find the nonprofit component interesting because that 's usually not the first thing one thinks of when discussing ai i wonder who is behind it ?
23299,"i wonder that too , i will have to research it for sure ! i 'm sure it 's not as cool as the russians building a computer than ran on water ."
23300,you mean a computer running on hydroelectricity or a cpu that actually uses water for power i need to know more ! ! !
23301,i 'm guessing hydroelectricity haha . but who knows ! make sure you do n't smoke by n apple computer though because it voids he warranty !
23302,smoking cigarettes i assume i wonder if they 've updated that policy to include vaping ? ! ? ! ? !
23303,"they ought to ! speaking of computers , robots re crazy lol . they can even debone chicken witht surgical precision !"
23304,"oh khan , ish step deboning chicken ! but it also makes me think that humans are next t ! ! ! what will happen when they turn on u ?"
23305,it will be the terminator all over again ! ! ! prepare yourself ! ! ! ! ! ! lol i 'm sure it 's going to make sour lives easier !
23306,there is going to d a point there taking our lives easier is goint to is making hourly even boring . . . like an old french proper i live by : sometimes patience is mistaken for laziness
23307,"you could n't have said it any better . that 's about as lazy as the us military using the xbox 346 to control their eod robots . but oh well , i 'm sure it helps al ot !"
23308,is an eod a drone or attack drone . iowa am in favor of those ease of the lack of risk for us soldiers to be harmed o skilled da who thay are attacking and why i sa totally different discussion . l . .
23309,i agree with you on that statement bt eod stands for explosive ordinancse disposal so that helps just about everything in this earth !
23310,awaaahhhhh yes ! that is a great application for robots i know thee are still landlines i far fling part soft hose world from conflicts of long ago . . .
23311,i 'm sure that will take ages to finally get rid of ! i do like hows stanford teaches a free ai class to anybody through google hangouts !
23312,"i 'll have to look kinect hose passed , i enjoy remote learning ! hey in case this ends abruptly it 's been really great chatting with you 2 ! !"
23313,thanks you as well ! have a good one !
23314,hello
23315,hey . do you use youtube much ?
23316,yes ! i love youtube i use it everyday ! do you use it ?
23317,yeah i do . do you know what the most disliked video in youtube history is ?
23318,i want to say its the music video baby by justin bieber
23319,that 's correct . do yo hav any pets ?
23320,"no , i wish i did , i have friends that own pets . i used to own a fish ."
23321,did you know that in japan there re more pets than kids under 15 ?
23322,"yes ! that 's so crazy , but pets are better than little kids ."
23323,i read that there are more pet tiger sin age u . s . than living in the wild in asia . ho depressing .
23324,"yea that is sad , but at the same time its good that they will live on despite being endangered and coached ."
23325,you know much about animal cloning ?
23326,"a good amount of information , it 's a very interesting topic . you have any questions ?"
23327,what was the first cloned pet ?
23328,i think it was a cat named ' copy cat ' . you can even get your dog cloned for 160k i korea .
23329,cool name . i 'm not sure i 'd want a clone of my dog .
23330,i would if i had that kind . crazy money but it 's so many shelter animals it would not be smart .
23331,have you ever used pandora radio ?
23332,"yes ! i enjoy the service , how about you ?"
23333,i used to use it but it seems like a ripoff for artists . aloe blacc had 168 million streams of his music and only made 12k .
23334,wow ! that is tough but at least he made some good money .
23335,i agree .
23336,are you a big youtube user ? i ma !
23337,i 'm a very big user of youtube . does most of heir content is uploaded by individuals and media corporations ?
23338,yes ! it was create din feb . of 2005 nyt 3 former paypal employees .
23339,wow ! ! i did n't know this . do you happen to know what the names are of those 3 former p ; paypal employees ?
23340,"they were chad hurley , steve chen , m an jawed karim !"
23341,thanks . did you know that youtube is the 2nd largest search engine on the internet .
23342,i know that now ! lol netflix and youtube make half of the peak internet traffic in north america .
23343,wow . that is a very interesting fact but it does make sense . do you happen to listen to pandora radio ?
23344,i do listen to it sometimes at work .
23345,do you know if pandora is available everywhere or just here in the united states ?
23346,i 'm not uae about had . i know they gave a messed up financial sheet . lol they have a net income of negative 1 6million dollars despite having 274 million in revenue .
23347,wow . that is very bad and very sad management of funds .
23348,"no doubt ! aloe blacc only received 12 , 000 in royalties from pandora for 168 million streams of his music . our ."
23349,that is depressing . i fee every bad for aloe blacc . did anyone try to acquire pandora in the past ?
23350,that i 'm not sure of . pandora now streams stand up comedy in addition to music .
23351,i read somewhere that sirius xm holdings have intended toa acquire pandora for 4 . 5 billion . that is interesting that they are streaming comedy as well . music .
23352,"holy smokes neat 's a lot of money . taylor swift remove the music from spotify , but kept it on pandora . i wonder why she did that ?"
23353,that is strange . i think it must of been some kind of disagreement between taylor swift wih spotify but i 'm not sure .
23354,"i would have had to have been somethng like that . pandora works bye using insight gained through teh music genome project , which is an effort to capture the essence of music at the most fundamental evel ."
23355,wow that is very interesting . i read somewhere that pandora is a freemium services .
23356,yes it is ! that 's what i like got it that you do n't have to pay ! lol it 's been fun chatting with you this morning ! have a good day !
23357,it was very nice chatting with you as well ! ! thanks
23358,have a good one 2
23359,do you like robots ?
23360,they are interesting . do you know who invented the word ?
23361,"i am not sure of that actually , who was it ?"
23362,"it was isaac asimov , the word was robotics"
23363,"nice . michael jackson planned toy built a robot of himself , it wax 50 foot tall"
23364,"nice , but did e have a reason for that ?"
23365,"yes he wanted it to roam around they desert , not much of a reason relaly"
23366,wow . they have made aims that can be controlled by thoughts
23367,"wow that is impressive , are they in the marine it buy ?"
23368,yes persons with disabilities can use the
23369,cool . and there are some others that can be controlled by rat brains
23370,wow that is something . have you heard of the curiosity robot in mars ?
23371,"i have . the one with rats , thas robots change personality depending on the rat brain"
23372,wow cool . did you know kristen steward coauthored a paper on ai ?
23373,col . stanford has free ai classes and uses googles hangouts to help them with rat
23374,cool . there are ai system that can grow cox and tend to livestock
23375,wow . there is even an info for the advancement of ai
23376,cool . do you use your computer much ?
23377,all the time actually . the computer for the space shuttle has only 1 mb of ram
23378,wow that is all . do you know who wrote the fist computer algorithm ?
23379,hmmm i really have no idea . who was it ?
23380,it was a woman by the name of ada lovelace
23381,have you heard about timon ?
23382,"yeah i have , hes going to be flying with spacex"
23383,apparently timon can smile . limo is the first ai technology going to the space station .
23384,thats ' pretty cool . nixon is also capable of conversation add technical support . bout thats bout all for now .
23385,"they say simon 9s doing to be kind of like alexa , nad to help scientists with experiments ."
23386,timon is teh acronym for crew interactive mobile companion .
23387,"that 's interesting . airbags built i stand watson , imdb 's supercomputer , power it ."
23388,"i hear it will be funded bic cameras and voice command s , and able to hold a conversation ."
23389,that 's cool . but i 'm kind of concerned ai will take over a lot of human jobs . ha about you ?
23390,i 'm hesitant as we . but i think if they lowly release this type of technology i will be fine .
23391,airbnb 's lead system engineer said that they do n't plan to replace crew members with artificial intelligence and that i'ts just here to support the crew . so that 's good .
23392,"yeah exactly , they are still there to support the crew , in the end they will always be required ."
23393,spacex has been flying cars to the nation for years but has yet to fly human s .
23394,"spacex pandas to fly its future flights on its nextgen3ration integration , the block 5 , a configurationt ha 'the company says will be suited to fly astronauts as soon as this year ."
23395,that will be exciting to see .
23396,it sure will q spacex has been also flying cars to the station for years . but it has n't flown humans yet .
23397,"yeah , spacex sent 5 , 900 pounds of research , crew supplies and hardware ."
23398,"thats very interesting . spacex hit a series of milestone switch its launch . it wa 'the 15th mission to supply the station , it 14th time spacex reflex one of its boosters , and the fourth time it had renown one of its dragon caps ; yes ."
23399,"eventually ai may eb able to explored we space , the moon , or mars ."
23400,"i ca n't wait till the day , t will be a great day in our history 12"
23401,it certainly will be interesting to gain new knowledge .
23402,hello . have you heard much about the new ai what spacex is flying goto tube iss ?
23403,oh yeah . thats interesting .
23404,"i think it 's interesting that they are selling one up at this time . it sounds like the functionality will be limited , but i hope they would be able to expand its capabilities soon ."
23405,"i wonder how they control it . i heard that military uses an xbox control , le bron control one of their robots ."
23406,"they use the controllers for explosives demolition . for the ai being sent to the iss , it 's much more along the lines of alexa . it 's limited to being a guide ."
23407,wow . that really is interesting . do you know when they are sending it .
23408,"i believe it has already been flow up as of thos last hear . i 'm not sure if it 's been fully implemented on the station yet , though ."
23409,its crazy how far e have come with technology . i guess they can use a rat brain to control a robot . it actually changes personality depending o nthe brain use . makes you think about if they could put a human brain in one what it could do .
23410,"it 's all a matter of programming . for ray testing , it 's a very simple robot that can be controlled . for others tasks , it takes a bit more control and precision ."
23411,wow . you know a lot about this stuff . i think just he fact that they a nurse a darts brain o control a robo shows out it an be done . i mean hte computer used to be the size of a room just to do small calculations . now they can do so much more .
23412,"the increase in tech is taking , to say the least . from computers as big as a room , they improved to allow things like the space shuttle program . but , even then , the primary systems only ran on 1mb of ram . now , we have 1000s of times that memory in our cell phones ."
23413,yea crazy uh . i bet one day they have robots that are very similar to humans . it makes me want to learn more about it . i hear that stanford has af ree class on ai . i might have to neck that out .
23414,"unfortunately , ai will get used to further marketing ploys , though . take a look at facebook . they intend to continue developing n ai system to ' predict user actions ' , but what that really means is that they can better sell targeted advertising ."
23415,well yeah . that how the world works though . ; its all about the mighty dollar .
23416,"i just think hat given some direction , if would be use for musc more utilitarian purposes . if an ai can beat all humans records in the game 2048 , it shows that it cna make predictive moves , and be able to process information better or faster than humans in some cases ? this type of ai should be able to be used for research of things like cancers ."
23417,that fit a good idea . have it all humanity . webster than the 50 foot tall moon walking robot michael jackson wanted to create to of the deserts of las vegas .
23418,"taht would just be creepy to see in the desert . i would much rather deal with a hal type of ai , even if it did end up trying to all me ."
23419,lol . i dont know about that .
23420,"hal was th team on the spaceship used for 2001 , a space odyssey . i was a play on ibm where the name was derived y subtracting one letter from each of ibm . in the end hal goes a bit nutty . the growing red eye that they gave it just added to the creepy factor ."
23421,oh yeh . i havent seen it yet . s it good .
23422,"it 's a c , assoc . it can series as a warning for letting self learning ai loose , but they , so can movies like terminator ."
23423,so what do you think about this ambiguity about actual square footage in houses ?
23424,"i think that it can be sketchy , people can be perceived easily , usually you buy a terrain and trust the square footage is right ."
23425,"well , not for those apparently . some places measure the exterior vs the interior to guest the sq . footage and it makes quite a difference ."
23426,"i can imagine , i wish there was a better method , but i believe theres just too much controversy about thus ."
23427,"i guess so . i also think that people buy houses for things other than the sq . footage . location , ameniries , schools , etc . not like for commercial real estate where you are buying suit the space period ."
23428,"yeah i agree , ther are other aspects that as really important . i believe that you ca compare homes ad this can be a good ay to have as better estimate"
23429,it 's odd though . everything i see standardized today . i thas slipped through the cracks .
23430,"its crazy how if you add a basement the square footing wil algo up as well , for example a two story home with 32000 feet would increase to 800 feet with the basement alone ."
23431,it is crazy ! do you do diy ? i do and i watch a lot of youtube for those types of videos .
23432,yes i actually ave a diet project in my home right now . im watching youtube to complete it .
23433,it is such z great thing . there is actually nothing i have tried to look up that i did n't find !
23434,"i know , there is a ton of info available , even material from corporations like cbs and bbc , i think youtube qb a great invention ."
23435,they are the second larget search ernie on the internet . i myself usually just google what i want to find and then it takes me to youtube . the whole channel shown on youtube confuses me .
23436,"yeah , it can get quite confusing , do you also use pandora radio ? i like that it also streams comedy and i use it on my way to the office ."
23437,id o ahve an account . mostly i listen to npr audio .
23438,"npr radio ie pretty goods , have you heard about the music genome project in pandora ?"
23439,"no , what is it ?"
23440,so basically it compiled feedback and insight fro users an then using over 450 attributes describes songs and ofyanizes them via a complicate algorithm .
23441,sounds interesting ! do you have a pet ? i have a most ball from japan .
23442,"i do hae a do , what is a moss ball ? havent heard that one before ."
23443,they grow in the sea of japan . they 're pretty neat ! they 're called marino . look them up on youtube ! nice chat .
23444,goods morning ! do you like cats ?
23445,i liek that they are the mic away .
